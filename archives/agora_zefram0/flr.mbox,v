The Game of Agora
  This Category includes Rules applying to all aspects of this Nomic.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1020/0 (Power=3)
Name is Agora

      The Official Name of this Nomic shall be Agora.

History:
Created by Proposal 913, date unknown
Transmuted from MI=1 to MI=Unanimity by Proposal 1020, Sep. 4 1994
Mutated from MI=Unanimity to MI=3 by Proposal 1484, Mar. 15 1995

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 101/0 (Power=3)
Obey the Rules

      All Players must always abide by all the Rules then in effect,
      in the form in which they are then in effect.  The Rules in the
      Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the first game.
      The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (Immutable) and
      201-219 (Mutable).

[CFJ ???: "abide by all the Rules" means the Rules as a whole, not
 necessarily each individual Rule.
 CFJ 24: Players must obey the Rules even in out-of-game actions.
 CFJ 825: Players would have to obey the Rules even if 101 were
 repealed.]

History:
Initial Immutable Rule 101, Jun. 30 1993
Mutated from MI=Unanimity to MI=3 by Proposal 1480, Mar. 15 1995

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 116/0 (Power=3)
Permissibility of the Unprohibited

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
      and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
      which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly
      or implicitly permits it.

History:
Initial Immutable Rule 116, Jun. 30 1993
Mutated from MI=Unanimity to MI=3 by Proposal 1483, Mar. 15 1995

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1011/3 (Power=2)
Game Entities May Not Be Arbitrarily Changed

      A "Nomic Property" is any property of any entity which that
      entity possesses solely by the virtue of the Rules defining that
      property.

      No Nomic Property shall be changed except in accordance with
      procedures specified by the Rules.

[CFJ 700: Neither nicknames nor Players are "created by the Nomic
 Rules, and exist only within the context of Agora Nomic."
 CFJs 815 & 816: If an amendment is made which changes the properties
 of an Entity, the Entity changes to conform to the new Rule, rather
 than the destruction of the old Entities.  If the old Entity has
 the same name as the new Entity, that implies continuity of that
 Entity if at all possible.]

      Whenever a message contains more than one notification, report,
      or other communication in which the Rules place some legal

      to have been sent sequentially, separated by infinitesimal
      increments of time, in the order which they appear in the
      message.

Defense of Marriage Act

      Any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, no action
      which is legal or permitted by the Rules when attempted
      by one set of Players shall be illegal or forbidden by
      the Rules when attempted by a different set of Players,
      due solely to the sexes (or lack thereof) of the Players
      involved.

Rule 1600/1 (Power=1)
Standard Mathematics

      Except where the Rules explicitly state otherwise, any
      mathematical term in the Rules shall be construed to have the

Rule 754/3 (Power=1)
Spelling and Grammar Errors

      Differences in spelling, grammar, or dialect, or the
      substitution of a word or phrase by a synonym or abbreviation,
      are inconsequential in all forms of Nomic communication, as long
      as there is no ambiguity in meaning. In other words, the meaning
      or validity of such communication is not altered in any way by
      such discrepancies.

[CFJ 712: This includes referring to a Player by a method other than
 eir name or nickname, as long as it is unambiguous.
 CFJ 744: In the context of Rule Changes, text in an existing Rule
 must be quoted exactly in order to be unambiguous.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 795/2 (Power=1)
Accurate Quoting Shall Not Be Penalized

      When a Player quotes a Rule, Proposal, Statement, Judgement, the
      words of another Player, or other references, that Player shall
      not be penalized in any way for the terminology or grammar used
      in those quotes.

      For the purpose of this Rule, a gain or loss of Kudos by any
      means shall not be construed as a punishment.

      This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which specifies
      terminology or grammar.

Rule 1497/4 (Power=1)
Truth in Advertising

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of any message sent to the Public Forum or
      in response to a request for information which that Player is
      required to provide commits the Crime of Misrepresentation, a
      Class C Crime.

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of a message to an Officer which that
      Officer is then required to act upon commits the Crime of
      Falsification, a Class C Crime.

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of evidence in a Claim of Error, Call for
      Judgement, or Judgement commits the Crime of Perjury, a Class B
      Crime.

      A Player shall never be convicted of more than one of the above
      Crimes for the same act.

[CFJ 827: If it is not clear that information is *not* presented
 as correct, it is.  Attempting an illegal move can, if the Player
 reports the move and knows it to be illegal, be a violation of this
 Rule.]

Rule 1727/3 (Power=1)
Happy Birthday

      WHEREAS, in June 1993, the world's only MUD-based nomic, Nomic
      World, had recently collapsed; yet, many of its players enjoyed
      nomic and did not wish to forego such a noble pursuit;

      And WHEREAS, Originator Chuck Carroll therefore composed an
      Initial Ruleset for an email nomic, based on the Initial
      Rulesets of Peter Suber, inventor of Nomic, and on the Rulesets
      of Nomic World and other nomics,

      And WHEREAS, a nomic thus rose like a phoenix from the ashes of
      Nomic World, played on the mailing list originally set up for
      discussion of Nomic World, and coming into existence at June 30,
      1993, 00:04:30 GMT +1200, with a message sent by First Speaker
      Michael Norrish, which read, in part,

       "I see no reason to let this get bogged down; there are no
        precedents or rules that cover this situation, so I think we
        may as well begin directly.... Proposals for new rules are
        invited. In accordance with the rules, these will be
        published, numbered and distributed by me at my earliest
        convenience."

      And WHEREAS, this nomic began as a humble and nameless nomic,
      known unofficially as yoyo, after the mailing list it was played
      on, until its Players, much later, gave it its official name of
      Agora,

      And WHEREAS, Agora has now become the wisest, noblest, eldest,
      and most interesting of all active email nomics, due to the hard
      work and diligence of Agorans as well as the frequent advice of
      Agoraphobes,

      And WHEREAS, Agorans desire to joyously commemorate Agora's
      founding,

      BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED that Agora's Birthday is defined to be
      the entire day of June 30, GMT +1200, of each year;

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that prior to, but not more than seven
      days before, Agora's Birthday, the Ambassador shall announce
      Agora's upcoming Birthday to all Friendly nomics;

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Notary may select up to three
      Contests, in existence on Agora's Birthday, which have as their
      purpose encouraging the celebration of Agora's Birthday; and
      which Contests, in the Notary's estimation, are worthy of

      Contest 5 VTs, and to their Contestmasters 2 P-Notes each;

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Courts shall be closed on
      Agora's Birthday; that is, the Clerk of the Courts shall not

      call for Appeal, or Appellate Decision, on Agora's Birthday; nor
      shall any Player Execute an Application to Submit an Opinion on
      Agora's Birthday; however, if any of the above do take place on
      Agora's Birthday, in violation of this Rule, this Rule does not
      deprive them of their usual effects.

Rule 1586/1 (Power=1)
Definition and Continuity of Entities

      A "Nomic Entity" is any entity which has no discernible
      existence without the Rules, only existing by virtue of the
      Rules defining it to exist.  No two Nomic Entities (including
      Players) shall have the same name or nickname.

      When the Rules defining a given Nomic Entity are repealed or
      amended such that they no longer define that entity, that entity
      ceases to exist, along with any properties it may have
      possessed.

      When the Rules defining a given Nomic Entity are amended such
      that they still define the Entity but in a different way or with
      different properties, that entity and its properties continue to
      exist to whatever extent is possible under the new definition.

Rule 478/9 (Power=1)
The Public Forum

      Whether a given medium is a Public Forum or not is a Nomic
      Property.  The Registrar is authorized to change whether a given
      medium is a Public Forum or not Without Objection.  When such
      a change is made, in order to be effective, the message
      annoucing the change must be sent to both a medium that was a
      Public Forum before the change, and a medium that is a Public
      Forum after the change.  (If a single medium is a Public Forum
      both before and after the change, a single message to that
      medium satisfies this requirement.)

      It is the responsibility of each Active Player to ensure that e
      is able to receive messages sent to every medium which the
      Registrar has designated as a Public Forum.  The temporary
      inability of a Player to receive a Public Forum does not deprive
      that medium of any legal significance as a Public Forum.

      Sending a message, by any medium or combination of media, to
      every Active Player, is equivalent to sending it to the Public
      Forum, provided that the message bears a clear indication that
      it is intended to be a message to the Public Forum, and it is
      verifiable that the message was in fact sent to every Active
      Player.

      Whenever the Rules calls upon some Player to "announce", "post",
      or "distribute" some communication or notification, this shall
      be accomplished by posting the communication or notification to
      the Public Forum, unless another rule specifies otherwise

[CFJ 707: Something sent to the PF is effective at the moment it is
 received by the listserver.
 CFJ 752: Something sent to a Player who is obligated to send it to
 all Players is sufficient for sending something to the PF.
 CFJ 813: A Player need not prove that e can receive the PF.
 CFJ 831: The Date: header of a message is not necessarily the time
 at which the message takes effect.]

The Nomic Week

      The Nomic Week begins at midnight, GMT, each Monday. Any
      automatic change in the state of the Game which must occur
      weekly occurs at the beginning of the Nomic Week. Any
      automatic change which must occur monthly occurs at midnight,

      occur quarterly occurs at midnight, GMT, on the first day of
      each calendar quarter.

      This Rule defers to any Rule that defines another explicit
      schedule for events.  Any activity that must be performed at
      least weekly, monthly, or quarterly, must occur at least once in
      the given period.

Rule 1023/9 (Power=2)
Definition of "As Soon As Possible"

      Whenever a Player is required to perform a certain action
      "as soon as possible", then:

      (i)  if the action is one that a Player is required to
           perform in the course of carrying out Official
           duties, then the Player is required to perform the
           action within a week, and no earlier than any other
           action which the performance of the duties of that
           Office already requires em to perform as soon as
           possible;

      otherwise,

      (ii) e is required to perform that action within a week,
           and no earlier than any other action e is already
           required to perform as soon as possible which is not an
           action performed in the course of carrying out Official
           duties.

      A Player who fails to observe these requirements commits the
      the Infraction of Tardiness, the penalty for which shall be the
      same as that for a Class D Crime. All Players are authorized to
      detect and report the commission of the Infraction of Tardiness.

      Activity of a purely discussionary nature is excluded from the
      ordering requirement, and may be conducted at any time.

      This Rule does not deprive actions which do not conform to its
      requirements of whatever effects they would otherwise have.
      Rather, this Rule defines the latest time at which actions to be
      performed "as soon as possible" may be performed without
      incurring a Penalty.  It takes precedence over other Rules which
      define a later latest time for the performance of these actions.
      Other Rules may impose earlier latest times, and if so, this
      Rule defers to them.

      This Rule defers to Rules which describe the responsibilities of
      Players who are On Hold, and to any Rules which impose different
      requirements on the timing of Official Duties.

[CFJ 1075: Rule 1023 should be interpreted such that no Rule with
 lower precedence than it can succeed in prohibiting activity of a
 purely discussionary nature.]

Rule 1079/2 (Power=1)
Definition of "Random"

      When a rule requires a random choice, that choice shall be made
      among all the possible choices with equal probability.

      Because of the impossibility of finding a truly random test,
      "equal", for the purposes of the above statement, shall mean
      "reasonably close to equal".  It is up to common sense to
      determine what is reasonably close to equal; however, the burden
      of proof of a method's randomness lies with the Player who used
      the method.

      The probability of a Platonic solid or coin, which is not
      specially weighted, falling on any given face is, for the
      purposes of this Rule, close enough to equal to satisfy the
      above requirement.

      The Speaker shall make all random determinations required by the
      Rules except when the Rules specify another party to make the
      determination.

Rule 114/1 (Power=3)
Rules Can Always Be Changed

      It must always be possible to make arbitrary modifications to
      the ruleset by some combination of player actions.  Any change
      to the gamestate that would cause this condition to become false
      does not occur, any rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

CFJ 920, Apr. 17 1997: Rule 114 should be interpreted such that a
change to the rules such that they instantaneously thereafter do not
permit modification of the rules is not prevented from occurring by
Rule 114 if it leaves the gamestate such that after some definite
finite or infinitesemal time interval the rules will again change such
that the gamestate then satisfies Rule 114's condition.
Relevant Rules: 114

[CFJ 906: the term 'ruleset' as used within Rule 114 refers to a set
 of information that includes all Rules, and not merely to a
 representation of that information.]

      Power.

[CFJ 858: If a low-Power (low-MI at the time of Judgement of CFJ 858)

 mean something other than its ordinary English meaning, that
 may or may not constitute a conflict; whether it does must be

Rule 1030/4 (Power=3)
Precedence Between Rules with Equal Power

      If two or more Rules with the same Power conflict with one
      another, then the Rule with the lower Number takes precedence.

      If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of Rule) or
      takes precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supercede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.

      If all of the Rules in conflict explicitly say that their
      precedence relations are determined by some other Rule for
      determining precedence relations, then the determinations of
      the precedence determining Rule shall supercede the numerical
      method for determining precedence.

      If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

Rule 1513/1 (Power=1)
Authority of Non-Rule Entities

      It is legal for the Rules to grant the power to require Players
      to perform (or not perform) actions to Nomic Entities created in
      accordance with the Rules.  Such Entities shall have whatever
      power is granted to them by the Rules.  In the event that the
      requirements of such an Entity conflicts with the Rules, the
      Rules shall always take precedence.

      If two or more such Entities conflict with one another, then the
      relative precedence of the respective Rules which grant coercive
      Power to the Entities in conflict shall determine which
      requirements take precedence.  If two or more Entities which are
      authorized by the same Rule conflict, then the Entity which was
      created first under the authority of that Rule takes precedence
      over the others.

      No Nomic Entity is permitted to require a Player to perform or
      not perform an action unless the information of which actions
      can be required of em by that Entity has been previously
      provided to that Player. Especially, no body of text is
      permitted to require Players to perform or not perform any
      actions unless said body of text has previously been made
      available to that Player.

      it, may be imposed.

Rule 1584/0 (Power=2)
Absolvement of Duty for On Hold Players

      An On Hold Player is not permitted to Vote on Proposals, make
      Proposals, or hold Office, and cannot be required by the Rules
      to perform any duty or action, unless that Rule specifically
      states that it can require On Hold Players to perform actions.

Rule 1043/3 (Power=1)
Deregistration

      A Voter may deregister from Agora by sending a message to the
      Public Forum announcing eir deregistration. A Voter who
      deregisters in this fashion ceases to be a Player effective at
      the time date-stamped on that message, and any attempts by em to
      reregister before the beginning of the next month are without
      effect; this Rule takes precedence over Rules which would cause
      em to be reregistered before the beginning of the next month.

      Other Rules may define other conditions under which Voters may
      be deregistered.

Rule 1042/8 (Power=1)
Deregistration due to Silence

      Each Player is either Noisy, Quiet or Silent. Whenever a Player
      posts to the Public Forum, or a new Player registers, that
      Player is Noisy.

      Any Player can cause another Active Noisy Player to become
      Quiet by stating that e is doing so, and clearly identifying
      that Player, in the Public Forum.  If a Player has been Quiet
      continuously for two weeks, e becomes Silent.  If a Player has
      been Inactive continuously for two months, e becomes Silent.

      Any Player can cause a Silent Player to be deregistered by
      stating in the Public Forum that the Silent Player has
      Abandoned the game. If the Speaker is Silent, and it is alleged
      in the Public Forum that e has Abandoned the Game, e commits
      the Class A Crime of Speaker Abandonment. E ceases to be
      Speaker, and the Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker. E is then
      deregistered. In either case, the Registrar shall, as soon as
      possible after an allegation in the Public Forum that a Player
      has Abandoned the game, confirm or deny in the Public Forum
      that the deregistration has actually occurred.

      The Registrar shall include in eir Report the most recent
      date on which each Player changed from being Noisy, Quiet or
      Silent to any of the others.

      This Rule, apart from this paragraph, shall be completely
      without effect. Two weeks after this paragraph is inserted into
      this Rule, this paragraph shall be deleted from this Rule.

      any role or position to which a Rule assigns any duties or
      powers.  Noone who is not registered may occupy such a role or

      The foregoing paragraph shall not apply to the holding of Patent
      Titles, or any position which a Rule specifically says may be

      from registering, calling CFJs, or doing things that nonPlayers
      generally are able to do.

Rule 1006/6 (Power=1)
Defaults for Officers

      An Office is a position of authority or responsibility
      established by the Rules and held by a Player, who is called an
      Officer.

      At any time, an Office is held by exactly one Player; if no
      other Rule directly or indirectly specifies which Player holds
      an Office, it shall be held by the Speaker.

      A position of responsibility or authority is only an Office if
      the Rules specifically designate it as such.  An Office only
      exists as long as there is a Rule in force which specifies that
      it exists.  If the Rule or Rules which mandated the existence of
      an Office are changed such that they no longer do so, that
      Office ceases to exist.

      A given Office has whatever duties, responsibilities, and
      privileges that the Rules assign to it.

Rule 1686/0 (Power=1)
Official Reports

      For each Office, the Rules may designate a set of information to
      be the corresponding Officer's Report.  All such Reports are
      Official Reports.  The only information that is part of an
      Official Report is that which the Rules specifically state is
      part of that Official Report.

      The holder of an Office for which there is an Official Report
      shall maintain all information in the Report, and shall post it
      to the Public Forum at least once every Nomic Week.  Failure to
      post the Official Report is the Infraction of Failure to Report,
      the penalty for which is the same as the penalty for a Class D
      Crime.  The Registrar and the Speaker are authorised to detect
      and report commissions of this Infraction.

Rule 1064/7 (Power=1)
Freedom of Information Act

      If a Player is mandated by the Rules to maintain a set of
      records, these records must be available for public perusal,
      unless such records are designated by the Rules as private.  A
      Player who maintains such records must provide a copy of these
      Records to any other Player upon request within one week.  If e
      fails to so provide a copy of the requested records within one
      week, e commits Unlawful Nondisclosure, a Class D Crime, unless
      the Records are unavailable for reasons beyond eir control and e
      reports this fact, with explanation, within one week.

      For the purpose of this Rule, all records pertaining to Votes
      currently in progress, excluding the text of the Proposals under
      consideration, are designated as private until the end of the
      Voting Period.

Rule 1431/10 (Power=1)
Claims of Error

      A Claim of Error is a message posted to the Public Forum to the
      effect that a specific post to the Public Forum misrepresents
      the actual Game State, and documenting the nature of the error.

      A Response to a Claim of Error consists in posting to the Public
      Forum either a denial of the Claim or an admission of the
      Claim. If the Claim is admitted, then the Player making the
      admission is required to post a corrected version of the
      relevant portion of the message which was in error, before one
      week passes from the time the Claim of Error was made. A Player
      who admits a Claim but does not publish a correction is deemed
      not to have Responded to that Claim.

      A Response must be provided by the Player who is required by the
      Rules to publish the information subject to a Claim within one
      week of the Claim being made, unless any of the following holds:
       * a previous Claim was made concerning the same error
       * the relevant message has been posted more than 21 days before
       * another message by the same Player has corrected the error

      A Player who fails to post a Response within the alloted time
      commits the Infraction of Delayed COE Response, carrying a
      penalty of 1 Blot, to be reported by the Player who posted the
      Claim. A Player who incorrectly issues a denial of a Claim
      commits the Crime of Wrongful COE Denial, a Class 1 Crime,
      unless e then admits the Claim within 72 hours after the
      incorrect denial.

[CFJ 919: A PF message correcting an earlier PF message by the
 same player constitutes both a COE and the Response.]

Rule 1550/2 (Power=1)
Ratification

      Any Official Document (as specified in other Rules) may be
      ratified by the operation of an adopted Proposal (but no other
      sort of instrument).  The instrument must specify an Official
      Document (as specified in other Rules) which is subject to
      ratification.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1551/4 (Power=1)
Documents Subject to Ratification

      The ratification of an Official Document conforms the Game State
      to what it would be if the valid Official Document thus ratified
      was completely true and accurate at the time of the Document's
      publication in the Public Forum.  In other words, the State of
      the Game, upon such ratification, becomes that specified within
      the Document, plus all subsequent legal changes between the time
      of its publication and its ratification.

      All Game State changes due to the ratification of an Official
      Document occur at the time of such ratification; no retroactive
      effect is expressed or implied.

      A Document, once ratified, is for all legal purposes a true and
      accurate report.  The Game State it references may not be
      retroactively modified prior to the time it was published in the
      Public Forum, even to reflect a prior mistake, retracted or
      illegal move, or an Injunction.  This Rule takes precedence over
      any Rule that would allow such retroactive alterations or
      corrections to the Game State.

      In no way does the ratification of a Document invalidate,
      reverse, alter or cancel any prior moves or transfers, even
      unrecorded or overlooked ones.  Nor does the ratification of a
      Document change the legality or illegality of any prior move.
      Ratification only adjusts the actual Game State to conform to
      that perceived by the Players and Officers in Official
      Documentation.

      After a Document has been ratified, the Player in charge of
      maintaining that Document shall annotate all subsequent
      publications of that Document with the date of publication of
      the last such publication that was ratified..

Rule 1552/1 (Power=1)
Requirements for Ratification

      In order for an Official Document to be valid for the purpose of
      a Ratification, it must satisfy all the following criteria at
      the time the Proposal which would Ratify it is Proposed:

           i) The Rules require some specific Player to produce and/or
              maintain the document.
          ii) The Rules required it to be published in the Public
              Forum.  (A requirement that it be sent to all Players
              fulfills this criteria.)
         iii) It is not currently subject to a Claim of Error. (COE)
          iv) It is not currently subject to a pending Call for
              Judgement (CFJ), or a pending Appeal of a CFJ.
           v) The information within the Document has not been
              superseded by a subsequent Document.
          vi) The Document is not the Ruleset. The Ruleset is
              specifically excluded from Ratification.

      Further, a Document can become invalid during the Voting Period
      of a Proposal which would Ratify it if any of the following
      occurs:

           i) The Document is superseded by a subsequent Document
              which contradicts the information in the prior Document.
              This does not apply if there is a COE alleging the
              contradiction is an error, and the error is admitted
              before the end of the Proposal's Voting Period.
          ii) A COE is made on the Document, and the COE has not been
              denied before the end of the Proposal's Voting
              Period.
         iii) The Document becomes subject to a pending CFJ or a
              pending appeal of a CFJ.

       If, during the Voting Period of a Proposal to Ratify a
       Document, another Document is issued that does not contradict
       the prior Document, it does not alter the validity of the prior
       Document.

      this appointment to be valid, this Player must either explicitly

      within seven days of such appointment, or be the Speaker.  The
      Speaker can be appointed to hold an Office temporarily without

Rule 1645/2 (Power=1)
Temporary Delegation of Office

      A Player who holds an Office in the normal fashion is permitted
      to appoint another Player to perform the duties of that Office,
      for a Period not exceeding two weeks. This is called Delegation;
      the Player doing the appointing is herein referred to as the
      Delegating Player and the Player so appointed is herein referred
      to as the Delegated Player.

      An Office is legally Delegated if and only if the following
      conditions are met:

      (i)   the Delegating Player has posted to the Public Forum a
            Notice of Delegation, naming the Office being Delegated
            and the Delegated Player;

      (ii)  the Delegated Player is permitted by the Rules to hold
            the Office at the commencement of the Period of
            Delegation;

      (iii) the Delegated Player has posted, within the week
            immediately preceding or immediately following the
            posting of the Notice of Delegation, and to the Public
            Forum, a Notice of Consent to Delegation for that Office;

      (iv)  the Delegating Player still holds the Office in the
            normal fashion at the commencement of the Period of
            Delegation;

      (v)   the Period of Delegation has commenced and not yet
            concluded.

      The Period of Delegation commences at the time the Notice of
      Delegation is posted, or at the time the Notice of Consent to
      Delegation is posted, or at the time (if any) specified by the
      Delegating Player, whichever is latest. The Period of Delegation
      concludes two weeks after the Period of Delegation commences, or
      at the end of the Term of Service for the Delegated Office, or
      at the time (if any) specified by the Delegating Player,
      whichever is earliest.

      During the Period of Delegation, the Delegating Player ceases
      to hold the Delegated Office; the Delegated Player holds the
      Office temporarily, and earns the Salary for that Office as
      described in other Rules. At the end of the Period of
      Delegation, the Delegated Player ceases to hold the Delegated
      Office, and the Delegating Player resumes holding the Office in
      the normal fashion, unless the Term of Service for that Office
      has expired.  In that case, the Delegated Player continues to
      hold the Office temporarily, although the Office ceases to be a
      delegated Office.

      This Rule defers to all other Rules which do not contain this
      sentence.

      Election is already being conducted, the Registrar shall
      initiate an Election to fill that Office, as described

      The Referendum must list both the Office and the Player holding
      this Office by name. If upon passage of the Referendum the named
      Player is holding the named Office, then that Player is
      immediately removed from that Office.

      For this Referendum the default procedure for referenda is
      modified as follows: Vote Collector is the Player who called for
      the Impeachment Referendum. Voting Entities do not include the
      Officer under consideration for Impeachment. Adoption Ratio is
      2.

Rule 1644/1 (Power=1)
Dereliction of Duty

      A Player who:

      (i)   holds an Office in the normal fashion whose duties include
            the weekly production of an Official Report, and
      (ii)  fails in 3 consecutive weeks to produce the weekly Report
            for that Office

      commits the Infraction of Dereliction of Duty. The penalty for
      the commission of this Infraction is the same as that for a
      Class B Crime, in addition to which the Player is removed from
      the Office in the performance of whose duties e has been
      Derelict.

      The Registrar is the Officer authorized to detect and report
      the commission of Infractions of Dereliction of Duty by Officers
      other than the Registrar. The Clerk of the Courts is the Officer
      authorized to detect and report the commission of the Infraction
      of Dereliction of Duty by the Registrar.

Rule 1665/1 (Power=1)
Abuse of Responsibility

      The Rules can give certain Officers latitude to make certain
      decisions and determinations based upon their judgement.  When
      these decisions and determinations have effect on the Game
      State, Players shall always have the ability to make Claims of
      Error alleging that these decisions and determinations were made
      outside the authority given to the Officer.  This Rule takes
      precedence over any Rule which otherwise defines a final arbiter
      for such decisions and determinations.

      If such a Claim is denied by the Officer, the Player making the
      Claim is then permitted to make a Call for Judgement alleging
      that the Officer is guilty of Abuse of Responsibility, a Class C
      Crime.  This is the only time such a CFJ is permitted.

      In Judging such a CFJ, to find the Officer guilty the Judge must
      establish that the Officer did one of the following:

        i) Went beyond all reasonable interpretations of the Rules.
       ii) That e disregarded explicit instructions the Rules gave in
           regard to eir decisions and determinations.
      iii) That e showed a pathological lack of judgement in such
           decisions and determinations.

      The accused Officer must be given the opportunity to explain eir
      actions.  And such Judgements shall be made in accord to the
      strictest possible standard of proof.

Rule 1585/1 (Power=2)
Official Duties upon Officer Change

      Whenever the holder of an Office changes, any duties which the
      Rules had imposed upon the prior holder of that Office as a
      consequence of holding that Office which have not been fulfilled
      must instead be fulfilled by the new holder of that Office, as
      soon as possible after the change of Officer occurs and in the
      same order in which the prior holder of that Office had been
      required to fulfill them.

      The former holder of the Office is absolved of performing all
      such duties, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

      for the conduct of that Office, including any records the holder
      of that Office is required to maintain, are made available to
      the next Player to hold that Office.  A Player who fails to do
      so violates this Rule, and commits the Crime of Improper Officer
      Transition, a Class C Crime.

Rule 1728/2 (Power=1)
Actions Without Objection

      Certain changes to Nomic Properties may be made Without
      Objection.  Only those changes explicitly allowed by
      other Rules may be so made, and in order for such a
      change to take effect, the Rule allowing the change must
      explicitly state which Player or Players are authorized to
      make the change.

      In order to make a change Without Objection, a Player
      authorized to make a given change Without Objection must first
      post to the Public Forum eir intent to make such a change,
      unambiguously describing the change to be made.  The change then
      takes place when a Player authorized to make that change Without
      Objection (who need not be the same player who posted eir
      intent to make the change) posts to the Public Forum that that
      change is made, and the following conditions are fulfilled:
      * The post announcing the change is made no fewer than four
        days after, nor more than fourteen days after, the post
        annoucing the intent to make the change.
      * Between the two posts, no Player has posted to the Public
        Forum eir objection to the change.

      This Rule defers to Rules which place further restrictions
      on the effectiveness of changes made Without Objection.

Rebellion

      Any Player is either Abiding or Rebellious. At the time this

      Abiding.  A Player whose Location is the Beer Hall can switch
      from Abiding to Rebellious or from Rebellious to Abiding by
      sending a message to the Public Forum saying e does change so.
      The Registrar shall maintain a list of all Players that are
      Rebellious, and shall publish this list weekly.

      If at any time at least 1/3 of all Players are Rebellious a
      Revolt occurs. The Registrar must post the fact that a Revolt
      has occured to the Public Forum as soon as possible. If a revolt
      occurs, then:
      - The Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker
      - All Players that hold one or more Offices are retired from all
        such Offices.
      - All Rebellious Players become Abiding again

      * it specifies, by name, an Office which it pertains to
      * that Office is held by its author.

      A Statement of Policy, when issued, becomes an SLC, the
      Jurisdiction of which irrevocably consists of the Player holding
      the Office named therein. That Player shall also be its
      Maintainer.

      An Officer shall be permitted to change eir own Statement of

      any Statement of Policy ceases to exist whenever the Office it

======================================================================
Making Proposals
  This rather large Category includes Rules regulating the
  submission and distribution of Proposals.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1483/3 (Power=1)
Definition of Proposals

      A Proposal is created whenever a Proposing Entity delivers some
      collection of text to the Promotor with the clear indication
      that that text is intended to become a Proposal.  The collection
      of text thus delivered is a new Proposal, and the Proposing
      Entity which delivered it its Proposer. A collection of text is
      said to be Proposed when it becomes a Proposal.

      The delivery of the text of an existing Proposal which was
      Proposed less than three weeks previously does not cause that
      text to become another Proposal, unless there is a clear
      indication that that text is intended to become a duplicate of a
      prior Proposal.  In this case, the Proposing Entity must
      specifically acknowledge that the intended new Proposal is a
      duplicate of an existing Proposal.

      Further, the Promotor's distribution of previously undistributed
      Proposals never causes the Proposing of new Proposals.

[CFJ 762: Anything contained in a Proposal is part of that Proposal,
 unless the Rules or Game Custom specifically says otherwise.]

Rule 1698/0 (Power=3)
The Proposal System is Protected

      It must always be possible to adopt Proposals within a 4 week
      period. Any change to the game state which would result in
      this condition becoming false is cancelled and does not take
      place, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

Rule 105/1 (Power=3)
What Is a Rule Change?

      A Rule Change is any of the following:

      * The enactment of a new Rule;
      * The repeal of an existing Rule;
      * The amendment of the text of an existing Rule; or
      * Any change to a substantive property of a Rule other than
        its text.

      A "substantive property of a Rule" is any property of that
      Rule (other than its text) which determines in part or in full
      the ability of that Rule to govern by itself or in conjunction
      with other Rules.

[CFJ 708: An Amendment of a non-existing Rule is not a legal Rule
 Change.]

Rule 115/0 (Power=3)
Self-Referential Rules Allowed

      Rule Changes that affect Rules needed to allow or apply
      Rule Changes are as permissible as other Rule Changes.  Even
      Rule Changes that amend or repeal their own authority are
      permissible.  No Rule Change or type of move is impermissible
      solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a
      Rule.

Rule Changes Must Be Written Down

Rule 1339/6 (Power=3)
Precision in Rule Changes

      Exact precision is required in the specification of Rule
      Changes; any ambiguity or irregularity in the specification of a
      Rule Change causes it to be void and without effect.

      Variations in whitespace or capitalization in the quotation of
      text in an existing Rule to be removed or replaced does not
      create an irregularity or ambiguity, for the purpose of this
      Rule.  Any other variation, however, does.

Rule 594/3 (Power=1)
Proposals and Rule Changes

      When a Proposal is adopted, its Power becomes equal to its
      Adoption Index, and the provisions contained in the text of the
      Proposal are implemented to the maximal extent permitted by the
      Rules.  Provisions which are unclear, ambiguous, or inapplicable
      are ignored.  In a Proposal containing more than one provision,
      each provision is severable from the others, unless the Proposal
      states otherwise.

      For the purpose of the Rules, the application of an adopted
      Proposal is a legal procedure for changing Nomic Properties.

      The Adoption Index of a Proposal is the maximum of 1, the value
      requested by its Proposer (if any), and the value required for
      that Proposal by the Rules (if any).

[CFJ 778: It is legal for a Proposal to contain zero Rule Changes.]

      The Petition Fee for a Sane Proposal is increased by three.

      Players may cast no more than one vote on a Sane Proposal.
      Non-Player Voting Entities may not vote on Sane Proposals.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would allow
      non-Player Voting Entities to vote on Sane Proposals, or which
      would allow Players to cast more than one vote on a Sane

Rule 1753/1 (Power=1)
Repeal-O-Matic

      This Rule shall be known as the Repeal-O-Matic Rule and may be
      referred to unambiguously in that manner.  The Repeal-O-Matic
      Rule is a Proposing Entity, and its Executor is the Promotor.

      The Repeal-O-Matic Rule shall make from one to three proposals
      every week.  The contents of these Proposals are determined as
      follows.  The Promotor shall select five different Rules, at
      random, from the current Ruleset.  E shall then pick a number of
      these selected Rules (at least one, and not more than three, and
      no Rule picked more than once) to be used for the Repeal-O-Matic
      Rule's Proposals.

      The Promotor shall make these selections as soon as possible
      after the beginning of the Nomic Week.

      For each Rule picked by the Promotor, the Repeal-O-Matic Rule
      shall submit a Proposal that consists of the following quoted
      text, with substitutions mandated by this Rule:

          "PROPOSAL: Repeal Rule [Number]
                     This Proposal shall have an AI = [Power]
                     Rule [Number] is hereby Repealed."

      Where [Number] in the quoted text is replaced by the Rule Number
      of the Rule picked by the Promotor, and [Power] is replaced by
      the Power of that same Rule.

      If a rule picked by the promotor explicitly refers to other
      rules or to concepts or entities that also appear in other
      rules, the promotor is authorized, but not obliged, to add
      provisions to the Proposal that leave the ruleset in a more
      consistent and functional state after the repeal of the rule
      picked by the promotor.

      For the purpose of the Rules governing Proposals, it shall be
      deemed that The Repeal-O-Matic Rule has submitted its Proposal
      concerning a given Rule immediately after the Promotor makes the
      selection of that Rule.

Rule 1726/0 (Power=1)
The Guillotine

      There is a type of Application known as a Guillotine
      Application.  Such an Application is Executed by submitting it
      to the Assessor.  A Guillotine Application may specify when it
      is to take effect; if it does not do so, or specifies a time
      prior to its Execution, it takes effect when Executed.  For a
      Guillotine Application to take effect:

      * it must state that it is a Guillotine Application;

      * it must clearly identify exactly one Proposal to which it
        applies;

      * that Proposal's Voting Period must be in progress;

      * the ratio of the number of Active Senators whose signatures it
        bears to the number of Active Senators whose signatures it
        does not bear must exceed the Adoption Index of the Proposal;
        and

      * it must bear the signatures of at least two Senators.

      When a Guillotine Application takes effect, the Voting Period
      of the Proposal to which it applies immediately ends.  This Rule
      takes precedence over all other Rules governing the Voting
      Period of Proposals.

Rule 1451/10 (Power=1)
Disowning Proposals

      A Proposal is disowned when its Proposer sends a message to the
      Public Forum disowning it, provided that the Proposal in
      question either has not yet been distributed, or less than four
      days have passed since its distribution.  A Proposal can only be
      disowned by its Proposer, and then only if its Proposer is
      neither the Assessor nor has been the Assessor at any time after
      the distribution of that Proposal.

      The Assessor shall bill the disowning Player a fee of one
      P-Note.  All other payments or awards of Currency which would
      result from the submission of, voting upon, or adoption of that
      Proposal do not take place, regardless of the outcome of the
      Vote on that Proposal.  This Rule, however, neither requires nor
      permits any Payment Orders already executed as a result of this
      Proposal to be vacated.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would seek to
      cause the payment or award of Currencies as a result of the
      submission of, voting upon, or adoption of, a Disowned Proposal.

Rule 206/9 (Power=2)
Voting Entities and Votes

      A Voting Entity is an Entity which is generally authorized by
      the Rules to cast a vote or votes on a Proposal, although other
      Rules may withdraw this authorization from a Voting Entity in
      specific circumstances without that Entity thereby ceasing to
      be a Voting Entity. No Entity is permitted to vote on a
      Proposal unless it is a Voting Entity, and only those Entities
      designated by the Rules to be Voting Entities are Voting
      Entities. Players and Groups are Voting Entities.

      Each Voting Entity has two votes on a Proposal, unless another
      Rule says otherwise. However, no such Entity shall have more
      than five votes on any Proposal, regardless of what any other
      Rule may say to the contrary. The casting of any votes may only
      be achieved by the casting of Voting Tokens, as specified in
      other Rules.

Rule 452/12 (Power=1)
Prohibit Electioneering by Vote Collectors

      For the purposes of this Rule, a Vote Collector is defined as
      any Player to whom the Rules give the responsibility of
      tallying votes on a Proposal, Referendum or Election. Hence
      this Rule explicitly regulates the behaviour of the Assessor
      with respect to Proposals, and the behaviour of any Player
      (generally the Registrar or the Speaker) who acts as Vote
      Collector in an Election or Referendum.

      During the prescribed Voting Period of a Proposal, Election or
      Referendum, anyone who has served as Vote Collector for that
      Proposal, Election, or Referendum is prohibited from making use
      of any knowledge of the current status of the vote on that
      Proposal, Election or Referendum which e would not have had e
      not served as Vote Collector, in any attempt to influence the
      result of the vote on the Proposal, Election or Referendum.
      Doing so is the Crime of Electioneering, a Class C Crime.

      This Rule shall in no way prevent a player from transferring
      voting records to the current Vote Collector. Doing so is not a
      Crime.

      This Rule shall in no way prohibit the Vote Collector from
      posting, at any time and to the Public Forum, a list of those
      Voting Entities which have already voted or declared that they
      are Present on a given Proposal, Election or Referendum. If a
      vote or declaration of Presence has already appeared in the
      Public Forum prior to the publication of such a list, then the
      Vote Collector is permitted to indicate how the Voting Entity
      has voted, or whether it has declared itself Present. Otherwise,
      the Vote Collector is prohibited from specifically indicating
      whether the Voting Entity has voted, or declared Presence. The
      publication of a list as described in this Rule is not a Crime,
      unless specified as such by another Rule.

[CFJ 36: The Assessor may not use eir knowledge of the Votes to
 withdraw or disown a Proposal.
 CFJ 750: Only if the Assessor has the intent of influencing Votes
 is e in violation of this Rule.  Influencing the number of Votes
 also counts as influencing the result of the vote.]

Rule 1625/2 (Power=1)
Secrecy of Votes

      A Player who discloses the Vote or Votes cast by a Voting Entity
      before the end of the Voting Period of a Proposal commits the
      Crime of Breach of Voting Secrecy, a Class C Crime, unless one
      or more of the following applies:

        a) that Player did not at any time during the Voting Period of
           that Proposal, hold the Office of Assessor;
        b) that Player is the Executor of the Voting Entity whose
           Vote(s) were disclosed;
        c) the disclosure is made only to the Voting Entity (or its
           Executor) whose Vote(s) were disclosed; or
        d) the disclosure is required by another Rule.

Rule 683/5 (Power=1)
Legal Votes

      A Vote upon a Proposal must be one of FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN
      (or an obvious synonym of one of these).  Something which is not
      one of these is not a Vote upon a Proposal.

      A Vote cast upon a Proposal by a Voting Entity which has an
      Executor is cast at the time its Executor either posts it to the
      Public Forum or otherwise sends it to the Assessor.  A Vote is
      legally cast if it is cast during the Voting Period of that
      Proposal, and if that Voting Entity is entitled to cast a Vote
      on that particular Proposal.

      A Vote cast by a Voting Entity which does not have an Executor
      is cast at a time and in a manner specified in other Rules.

      This Rule in no way authorizes any Entity to cast Votes upon
      Proposals.

Announcing One's Presence

      A Player may declare that e is PRESENT on a Proposal, Election
      or Referendum, by sending a message to that effect to the Vote
      Collector of this Proposal, Election or Referendum.

      Players who declare themselves PRESENT on a Proposal, Election
      or Referendum during the Voting Period of that Proposal,
      Election or Referendum are, solely for the purpose of
      determining Quorum, considered to have voted, but a Player who
      both declares emself PRESENT and also Votes on the Proposal,
      Election or Referendum is counted only once toward Quorum.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which determine
      Quorum or whether a Proposal, Election or Referendum has met
      Quorum.

      sending a message to the Public Forum.

      For such a Proposal, until the Voting Period has ended:

         bended.
      Nor shall a Player Vote in public, only to Assessor.
      The Votes shall be unknown to others, even employer and

      that no one Votes FOR it, the Proposer shall Win.

      At any time during a Proposal's Voting Period, the Speaker may
      make it a Senate Proposal, by stating so in the Public Forum.
      If that does not happen, the Proposal is not a Senate Proposal.

      Entities other than Senators cannot Vote on Senate Proposals.
      If any Entity other than a Senator has already Voted on a
      Proposal by the time it becomes a Senate Proposal, their Votes
      on that Proposal change to ABSTAIN, and cannot change
      thereafter, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, and at the
      end of the Voting Period, the cost of casting those Votes is
      transferred to them.

Quorum

      Quorum for a Proposal is achieved if a vote is cast on that

      Players, whichever is greater.

      Quorum for a Proposal is calculated using the number of

Rule 1760/0 (Power=1)
Quorum Buyback

      Any Player other than the Assessor is permitted to buyback
      Quorum on a particular Proposal.  A Player is only permitted to
      do this once for any single Proposal. A Player does this by
      informing the Assessor that e wishes to buyback Quorum on a
      specified Proposal. That Player can rescind eir buyback before
      the end of the voting period by sending a message stating so to
      the Assessor.

      The effect of a Player's buyback on Quorum (if it is not
      rescinded) is to reduce the Quorum on the specified Proposal by
      one.  If multiple Players buyback Quorum on a single Proposal,
      the effect is cumulative.

      At the end of the voting period for that Proposal, the Assessor
      shall adjust the Quorum for that Proposal by subtracting one for
      each buyback that was not rescinded.  The Assessor shall then
      bill each Player whose buyback was not rescinded one P-Note.

      The Assessor is required to maintain the same secrecy about a
      Player's buyback as e is a Player's Vote.

Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal

      When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the Votes which

      Proposal shall then be assigned a Voting Index, as follows: the
      Proposal received no Votes opposed, and at least one Vote in
      favor, the Voting Index shall be Unanimity; if there are no
      Votes in favor, the Voting Index shall be zero; in all other
      cases, the Voting Index shall be the number of Votes in favor
      divided by the number of Votes opposed.

      If the Voting Index is greater than the Adoption Index for the
      given Proposal, or if both equal Unanimity, then that Proposal
      passes.  Otherwise, it fails.

Rule 108/1 (Power=3)
When May Rule Changes Take Effect?

      A given form of a Rule may not have effects earlier than
      the moment it came to have that form. The form of a Rule
      consists of its text and other substantive properties.

      No Rule Change may have retroactive application.

[CFJ 1: This does not prevent Rules from being explicitly dependent on
 circumstances before they are enacted.]

      If the message sent by the Assessor announcing the results of

Amendment Numbers

      A Rule's Amendment Number is equal to the number of times a

      Amendment Number is zero; this is the value of a Rule's
      Amendment Number when the Rule is Created, and it is the value
      of the Amendment Number of every Rule unless it is specified by
      the Rules to be otherwise.

      A Rule's Amendment Number shall be displayed in Official copies
      of the Ruleset, appended to the Rule Number, and separated by a
      forward slash.  Responsibility is given to the Rulekeepor to
      accurately update Amendment Numbers.

      Amendment Numbers may be used for Official purposes and in
      Official documents to distinguish between old versions of a
      Rule and the Rule's current text.

Awards & Penalties for Proposals

      The entity which paid the Petition fee for a given Proposal
      shall be known as the Sponsor of that Proposal.

      At the end of the Voting Period for a Proposal, if a Proposal
      has received more FOR Votes than AGAINST Votes, the Assessor
      shall pay out to the Sponsor a number of P-Notes equal to the
      number of FOR Votes less the number of AGAINST Votes.

      If, however, a Proposal has received more AGAINST Votes than FOR
      Votes, the Assessor shall bill the Sponsor for a number of
      P-Notes equal the number of AGAINST Votes less the number of FOR
      Votes.

      If the Sponsor and the Proposer of a Proposal are not the same
      entity and the Proposal passes, the Assessor shall pay out 2
      P-Notes to the Proposer.  If the Sponsor and the Proposer of a
      Proposal are not the same and the Proposal fails, the Assessor
      shall bill the Proposer 1 P-Note.  This is in addition to any
      other payments required by this or other Rules.

      For the purpose of this Rule, Votes by Voting Entities which are
      not Players do not count.

      The Assessor shall execute all Payment Orders required by this
      Rule no later than the time e announces the Voting Results of
      the Proposal in question.

[CFJ 1077: If a Proposal is Disinterested, i.e., it has no Sponsor,
 then it is true that the Sponsor and the Proposer of the Proposal
 are not the same, and the reward or penalty specified in the
 fourth paragraph applies.]

Referenda and Elections
  This Category includes Rules regulating voting on entities
  other than Proposals, particularly Referenda and Elections.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1434/3 (Power=1)
Default Procedure for Referendum Voting

      When a Referendum Vote is required and the procedure is not
      defined elsewhere, the following Standard Referendum Voting
      Procedure shall be used. Details specified herein are defaults
      which may be modified by other Rules for specific situations.

      This procedure shall under no circumstances be used for Voting
      on Proposals, unless specifically required by the Rules
      governing specific types of Proposals.

      * Vote Collector: The Vote Collector is the Entity responsible
      for collecting and tallying the Votes and announcing the result.
      This Entity is the Speaker if not otherwise specified.

      * Voting Entities: Every Player not on Hold may Vote on a
      Referendum.  On Hold status is measured at the time a Player
      sends eir Vote.

      * Voting: A Voting Entity Votes by sending eir Vote to the Vote
      Collector during the Voting Period, indicating what Referendum e
      is Voting on, and what eir Vote is.

      * Vote Values: A Vote is FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN. Words which
      are effectively synonymous with these are also permissible.

      * Vote Strength: Every Vote has equal strength. No Voting Entity
      may Vote more than once on any single Referendum.

      * Retraction: A Vote, once sent to the Vote Collector, cannot be
      changed.

      * Start of Voting: The Voting Period begins at the time the
      first correct and legal announcement that a Referendum is
      begun, as defined in other Rules, is sent to the Public
      Forum, together with the identity of the Vote Collector.

      * Duration of Voting: The Voting Period lasts for one Week. All
      Votes received by the Vote Collector outside of the Voting
      Period have no effect.

      * Secrecy During Voting: Unless otherwise specified, the Vote
      Collector may not give away any information about the Votes
      while the Voting is underway.

      This shall in no way prohibit the Vote Collector from posting,
      at any time and to the Public Forum, a list of those Players who
      have already Voted.

      * Secrecy After Voting: Unless otherwise specified, the Vote
      Collector shall post to the Public Forum, after the Voting
      Period is over, the number of Votes of each kind as well as the
      name and Vote of each Entity which cast a Vote.

      * Adoption Ratio: The Adoption Ratio, the ratio of FOR Votes on
      a Referendum relative to the AGAINST VOTES, must be greater than
      1 for the Referendum to pass. If it is not, the Referendum
      fails.

      * Quorum: Quorum shall be set at 50% of the eligible Voting
      Entities at the beginning of the Voting Period. If a smaller
      fraction voted, the Referendum automatically fails.

      * Nonperformance by Vote Collector: The Vote Collector must
      perform eir required duties, but if the result of a Referendum
      is not announced within one Week following the end of the Voting
      Period, it automatically fails.

      * Effectiveness: the full effects of a Referendum, as defined
      in Rules which make use of the Referendum procedure, come
      into force as of the moment the results are announced to the
      Public Forum.

      indicating what Election e is Nominating for.

      * Candidates: A Player who has Nominated for an Election is
      called a Candidate for that Election.

      * Retraction: A Nomination, once sent to the Vote Collector, may
      be retracted before the end of the Nominating Period. A player
      may retract a Nomination e has made by sending a message to the

      Period is over, the names of all Players who Nominated for the
      Election.

      If there are no Candidates in a given Election, then that
      Election shall have no Winner. If there is only one Candidate in
      a given Election, then that Candidate shall be the Winner of
      that Election.

      Candidates are Announced, which shall be conducted using the
      standard procedure for Referendum Voting with the following
      exceptions :

      * Vote Collector: The Vote Collector for the Referendum is the
      same as the Vote Collector for the Election.

      * Vote Values: A Vote is the name of exactly one of the
      Candidates for the given Election. Words which are effectively
      synonymous with these are also permissible.

      * Adoption: The Winner of the Election is the Candidate for whom
      the most votes were cast. If there is more than one such
      candidate, the Speaker chooses one of those candidates as the
      winner, and must announce eir chosen candidate as winner to the
      Public Forum.

      * Quorum: Quorum shall be set at 50% of the eligible Voting
      Entities at the beginning of the Voting Period. If a smaller
      fraction voted, the Election has no Winner.

      * Nonperformance by Vote Collector: The Vote Collector must
      perform eir required duties, but if the result of an Election is
      not announced within one Week following the end of the Voting
      Period, the Election has no Winner.

      * Effective Time of Election Results: The results of an Election
      are effective at the time the results of the Referendum are
      announced; or, if there is no Referendum, at the time that the
      Vote Collector announces that there is to be no Referendum.

      * Cutoff for Challenges: Any challenge of the correctness of the
      announced results of an Election must be made within seven days
      of the time the results are announced.  If seven days pass from
      the time the results are announced without a challenge, the
      announced results are the true results of that Election, whether
      or not they be in error in any way.

Applications
  This Category includes Rules concerning Applications.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1626/1 (Power=1)
Applications

      An Application is any body of text designated as such by a
      Player.  This Player is known as its Sponsor.

      A Player's Signature is added to an Application when e sends a
      message to that Application's Sponsor indicating that e wishes
      to sign it.

      A Player's Signature is stricken from the Application when e
      sends a message to the Sponsor of the Application stating that e
      wishes eir signature stricken.  Further, the Sponsor of an
      Application may strike any Signature from the Application at any
      time.

      If an Application is amended in any way (except to add or strike
      a Signature), any and all Signatures which appear on it are
      stricken from it.

      An Application is Executed when its Sponsor submits it to
      whatever Officer or other Player is designated by the Rules to
      receive Applications of that particular type, with whatever
      effect is defined by the Rules for the Execution of that type of
      Application.  However, any other Rule notwithstanding, the
      Execution of an Application shall have no effect unless Executed
      within 14 days of the time the oldest Signature which appears on
      it was added.

      If a Player Executes an Application which contains Signatures
      added to it in a manner inconsistent with this Rule, e commits
      the Crime of Application Fraud, a Class D Crime.

Rule 1563/2 (Power=1)
Statement of a CFJ

      In order to be Judged, a Call for Judgement must contain a
      single clearly-labeled Statement which must be able to be
      determined by the means of logical reasoning, with the
      presumption of perfect knowledge, to be either TRUE or FALSE.
      Statements which are inherently contradictory or which are
      vacuous are not acceptable, and a CFJ containing such a
      Statement shall not be Judged.

      If a CFJ fails to meet the requirements of this or of other
      rules it lacks standing and is to be dismissed.

      It is permitted for a Call for Judgement to contain Arguments,
      Evidence, or other material placed there at the Caller's
      discretion.  However, the Judge is not required to take notice
      of any part of the CFJ other than the Statement in formulating
      eir Judgement.

Selecting a Judge
  This Category includes Rules describing how a Judge is selected
  for a CFJ.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 951/10 (Power=1)
Selecting a Judge

      Whenever there is an open Call for Judgement to which no Player
      has been assigned as its Judge, the Clerk of the Court shall, as
      soon as possible after being made aware of this condition,
      randomly select a Player to be assigned as its Judge.  This
      selection shall be made from amongst all those Players eligible
      to serve as the Judge of that CFJ.

      Once assigned as the Judge of a CFJ, that Player remains the
      Judge of that CFJ until e is recused from that CFJ, or e ceases
      to be a Player.

      The Clerk shall announce the identity of the Player who is
      assigned to Judge a CFJ as soon as possible after the selection
      is made.

      A CFJ is "open" if it has neither been dismissed nor judged, or
      if there is an outstanding judicial motion pertaining to that
      CFJ which has been neither granted nor denied.  A CFJ which is
      not open is closed.

[CFJ 723: The CotC may make another assignment, (without legal effect)
 as long as e makes one according to this Rule as well.]

Rule 698/3 (Power=1)
Always an Eligible Judge

      Every Active Player is eligible to Judge a a given CFJ unless
      specifically made ineligible by some Rule.

      The Caller of a given CFJ is never eligible to Judge that CFJ.

      If there would otherwise be no Players eligible to Judge a CFJ,
      then all Active Players, excluding the Caller and those Players
      Barred by the Caller, shall be eligible, any other Rule to the
      contrary notwithstanding.

      If this still does not result in there being any Players
      eligible to Judge, then all Players (Active or not), excluding
      the Caller and those Players Barred by the Caller, shall be
      eligible.

      If this still does not result in there being any Players
      eligible to Judge, then all Players, excluding the Caller, shall
      be eligible.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule or combination of Rules
      which would result in there being no Players eligible to Judge a
      given CFJ.

      specifying the CFJ for which e wishes to be made ineligible.

      If, at the time a Player makes emself ineligible to be a Judge
      of a CFJ in this manner had already been selected as the Judge
      of that CFJ, the Clerk of the Courts shall bill that Player a

      the recusal of a delinquent Judge by posting eir demand in the
      Public Forum.

      A Judge recused for delinquency commits the Infraction of
      Judicial Delinquency, which bears a penalty of 2 Blots to be
      reported by the Clerk of the Courts.

Delivering Judgement

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 408/9 (Power=1)
Accepting Judge-ship

      The Player assigned to Judge a Call for Judgement is required to
      either return a Judgement upon that CFJ or dismiss that CFJ
      within the assigned deliberation period, which ends seven days
      after e is assigned to Judge it.

      Failure to do so is the Infraction of Judging Late, detected
      and reported by the CotC. At the time of the report of
      infraction, if the CFJ has been Judged or dismissed then the
      penalty is 1 VT and the Judgement or dismissal is legal even
      though delivered late.  Otherwise the penalty is 3 Blots, and
      the Judge becomes ineligible to Judge that CFJ, and a new Judge
      shall be assigned in the usual manner.

      A Judge who has neither judged nor dismissed a CFJ within seven
      days after the end of the assigned deliberation period becomes
      ineligible to Judge that CFJ, and any Judgement or Dismissal
      submitted after this time is not legal and shall not be accepted
      by the CotC.

      However, if the Player assigned to Judge a CFJ ceases to be
      eligible before judging or dismissing that CFJ, then e is
      neither required nor permitted to either return a Judgement on,
      or dismiss, that CFJ, and ceases to be the Judge assigned to
      that CFJ at the moment e becomes ineligible.

Rule 1565/6 (Power=1)
Dismissal of a CFJ

      A Judge must dismiss a CFJ if one of the following is true of
      it:

        i) It contains no clearly-identifiable Statement.
       ii) Its Statement can not logically admit to either being TRUE
           or FALSE.
      iii) Its Statement does not relate to a matter relevant to the
           Rules.
       iv) Its Statement fails to comply with the Rules.
        v) It lacks standing, as defined elsewhere.
       vi) After a reasonable effort by the Judge to obtain all
           relevant information, no determination can be made of the
           truth or falsity of its Statement.

      The Judge does this by notifying the CotC of the CFJ's
      dismissal, and the reasons e is doing so.  Dismissals are only
      legal when made for the reasons listed in this Rule.  Dismissal
      occurs when the CotC is notified of a legal dismissal.

      As soon as possible after being notified of a legal dismissal,
      the CotC must post to the Public Forum a notice of the dismissal
      and the Judge's reasons for doing so.

      If the dismissal, upon appeal, is subsequently set aside, then
      that CFJ is no longer dismissed. It shall be considered again
      and can not again be legally dismissed for the same reasons.

      A Judge who dismisses a CFJ before the end of the assigned
      deliberation period shall receive a Judicial Salary of 1 VT.

CFJ 909, Mar. 17 1997: The phrase 'considered again' in Rule 1565
should be interpreted such that when a dismissal of a CFJ has been set
aside, the Clerk of the Courts should assign the CFJ to a new Judge
selected from among those eligible, who then has one week to deliver a
Judgement.

Injunctions--General

      A Judge is permitted to issue orders requiring one or more

      actions.  Such an order is called an Injunction.

       To be legally made, an Injunction must:

        i) Specify the Player(s) to whom it applies.
       ii) Specify the action(s) the Player(s) are required to perform
           or refrain from performing.
      iii) Either be attached to a legally made Judgement at the time
           that Judgement is originally delivered to the Cotc, or be
           legally made by the Board of Appeals in an Appeal of an
           Injunction.
       iv) Be of a type explicitly defined in the Rules.
        v) Be issued in a manner consistent with the Rules.

      An Injunction which does not meet these criteria has no effect.

Legal Force of Injunctions

      effect, either the Injunction or the Judgement it accompanies is
      appealed, its effect is deferred until the resolution of the
      appeal(s).

      If an appeal involving an Injunction which has not taken effect,
      and which was originally attached to a Judgement, or the
      Judgement to which it is attached resolves, and neither the
      Injunction nor the Judgement has been overturned, and no other
      appeal is pending on the Injunction or the Judgement, the
      Injunction takes effect immediately upon resolution of the
      appeal.

      If an appeal fails to uphold an Injunction, or the Judgement
      it accompanies, the Injunction is set aside immediately upon
      resolution of that appeal.

      Injunction is set aside prior to that time.  Failure to do so is
      the Crime of Violating an Injunction by Omission, a Class C
      Crime.

      A Player is required to refrain from all actions prohibited em
      by a legal Injunction, for the duration that it is in effect.
      Each performance of such an action is the Crime of Violating an
      Injunction by Commission, a Class C Crime.

Rule 1737/0 (Power=1)
Injunctions on Vacating Payment Orders

      The Rules may require, in certain cases, that a Judge issue an
      Injunction ordering that a Payment Order be vacated.  If the
      Payment Order named by such an Injunction is vacated, and the
      Injunction itself later set aside, the Player who vacated that
      Payment Order shall, as soon as possible after the Injunction
      was set aside, execute a new Payment Order identical to the
      vacated Payment Order.

Rule 1742/0 (Power=1)
Agreements Between Players

      If two (or more) Players enter into an agreement, but one (or
      more) of these Players then fails to comply with that agreement,
      any other Player party to that agreement may make a CFJ alleging
      that that agreement has been broken.

      If the Judge of such a CFJ finds that the agreement has in fact
      been broken, e is permitted to issue Injunctions binding upon
      any or all of the parties of the broken agreement so as to
      effect fair and appropriate restitution for its breach.  When
      restitution would involve the transfer of Currencies, the Judge
      is authorized to execute whatever Payment Orders are necessary
      to effect fair and appropriate restitution.

      The above notwithstanding, no restitution shall be available
      with respect to the breach of the agreement which would have
      required a Player to break the Rules, nor shall restitution
      include the execution of Payment Orders, the payor of which is
      any entity not party to the agreement.

      Nothing in this Rule shall be construed so as to impair the
      enforcement of an agreement which requires a Player to violate
      another agreement.

      A CFJ alleging that an agreement has been broken called by
      anyone who is not party to that agreement lacks standing and
      shall be dismissed.

Rule 1365/6 (Power=1)
Concurring and Dissenting Opinions

      There shall exist a type of Application called an Application
      to Submit an Opinion.  Such an Application, if effective, has
      the effect of annotating a Judgement or Dismissal in a given
      Call for Judgement.  In order for such an Application to have
      effect upon Execution, it must satisfy the following
      requirements:

      * It must clearly indicate to which CFJ it applies.
      * It must be labeled as either a Concurring Opinion or
        a Dissenting Opinion.
      * It must indicate whether the Judgement or Dismissal to
        which it applies is that of the Judge or that of the
        Appeals Court.
      * It must be accompanied by reasons and arguments, which
        may include, but are not necessarily limited to, citations
        of deciding Rules, past Judgements, and Game Custom.
      * It must bear the Signatures of at least two Players.
      * It must be Executed no earlier than the submission of the
        Judgement or Dismissal to which it applies, and no later than
        one week after the publication by the Clerk of the Courts of
        that Judgement or Dismissal.

      An Application to Submit an Opinion is Executed by submitting
      it to the Clerk of the Courts.  Such an Application, having
      been Executed and having met all the requirements for
      effectiveness, is also called an Opinion.  It is also referred
      to as a Concurring Opinion or a Dissenting Opinion, as
      indicated in the Opinion.

      Once an Application to Submit an Opinion is Executed and takes
      effect, the Clerk of the Courts must distribute the Opinion to
      all Players as soon as possible.  Furthermore, the Opinion must
      be appended to the Legal Judgement or Dismissal.

Rule 911/8 (Power=1)
The Board of Appeals

      When an appeal is initiated, a Board of Appeals shall be
      selected in order to reach a decision about the consideration
      mandated by the appeal.

      A Board of Appeals consists of three distinct Players, called
      Justices.  The Clerk of the Courts selects the Justices for each
      Board, as follows, until three eligible Justices have been
      selected;  The Speaker is selected, if eligible; The Justiciar
      is selected, if eligible; The CotC is selected, if eligible; Any
      remaining positions are then filled by random selection, by the
      CotC, from all remaining eligible Players.

      A Player is ineligible for selection if any of the following is
      true:

        i) E has already been selected to serve on that Board.
       ii) E has been dismissed as Justice from that Board.
      iii) E has been Judge in the matter the Board is to consider.
       iv) E was not eligible to Judge the CFJ that resulted in the
           matter under consideration when it was called, and this
           restriction does not prevent three eligible Players from
           being selected by the CotC for the Board.
        v) E is on Hold, and this restriction does not prevent three
           eligible Players from being selected by the CotC for the
           Board.

      A Justice is permitted to appoint another eligible Player to
      replace em as Justice on a given Board, provided the Player
      consents. A Justice does this by notifying the Clerk of the
      Courts of the appointment.

      In each case, the insistence of any three Players, posted in the
      Public Forum, shall initiate a particular appeal.

      The insistence of a single Player shall initiate an appeal if
      the appeal is of an Injunction which names the insisting Player,
      if the appeal is of a Judgement that found a Crime had been
      committed by the insisting Player, or if the insisting Player is
      the Judge who made the decision that is appealed.

      The elements that are permitted to be appealed, what the Board
      is to consider, and what results from its findings, are as
      follows:

        i) The Judgement of the CFJ;

Rule 1447/11 (Power=1)
Final Judgement upon Appeal

      Once a Board of Appeals has been selected to decide a particular
      appeal, the Justices shall, collectively, consider the question.

      Each Justice has seven days, from the point e becomes Justice on
      a particular Board, in which to reach a determination that
      either sustains or overturns the matter being considered by that
      Board and submit it to the CotC.

      Failure to do so is the Infraction of Failing to Judge an
      Appeal, detected and reported by the CotC, bearing a penalty of
      3 Blots, which results in that Justice's dismissal as a Justice
      from that Board. In this case the CotC must randomly select an
      eligible Player to replace em.

      After all three Justices have submitted their determinations to
      the CotC, the CotC shall post these determinations in the Public
      Forum along with any arguments, evidence, or other material
      included with those determinations.

      If a majority of the Justices agree to sustain the matter being
      considered, it is sustained; otherwise, it is overturned.  The
      specific results of overturning a matter upon appeal are
      determined by the Rules permitting such appeals.

      Each Justice who submits eir determination to the CotC before
      the end of the assigned deliberation period shall receive a
      Judicial Salary of 1 VT each upon the publication of their
      determinations.

Rule 1693/1 (Power=1)
Appeal of a Judgement

      If the Judgement of a CFJ is Appealed, the Board of Appeals
      shall consider the correctness of that Judgement. The Board may
      rule that the original Judgement was either correct or
      incorrect.

      If a majority of the Justices find that the original Judgement
      was correct, then the Board's ruling is that the original
      Judgement was correct. In that case, the original Judge of the
      CFJ shall retain eir Judicial Salary and the original Judgement
      has legal effect.

      If a majority of the Justices find that the original Judgement
      was incorrect, then the Board's ruling is that the original
      Judgement was incorrect. In that case, the original Judge
      of the CFJ shall forfeit eir Judicial Salary. The Board may
      then act in one of three ways, provided that a majority of
      the Justices agree:

        i) Reversal of the Judgement. In this case, the CFJ shall
           be treated as if it were Judged normally, with the
           Judgement being that which a majority of the Justices
           agree on.
       ii) Dismissal of the CFJ. The CFJ shall be considered
           dismissed.
      iii) Re-assignment of the CFJ. In this case, the original
           Judgement shall be ignored, and the CotC shall reassign
           the CFJ to a new Judge in the same fashion as it was
           originally assigned; the original Judge will be
           considered Ineligible. The new Judge cannot make the
           same Judgement as the original Judge for the same
           reason.

      If a majority of the Justices find that the original Judgement
      was incorrect, but no majority of the Justices agree on what
      action to take, then the CFJ shall be re-assigned as above.

      shall only consider whether the dismissal was properly
      made. An illegal dismissal shall not be considered
      "properly made."

      If the Board finds the dismissal to have been properly
      made, the original Judge of the CFJ shall retain eir
      Judicial Salary, and the CFJ shall remain dismissed.

      If the Board finds the dismissal to have been made
      improperly, the original Judge of the CFJ shall have eir
      Judicial Salary revoked. The CotC shall reassign the CFJ
      to a new Judge in the same fashion as originally
      assigned; the new Judge cannot dismiss it for the same
      reasons as given by the original Judge.

      and was appropriate for the situation, it shall have normal
      effect.

      If the Board finds that the Injunction was made illegally,
      or that it was inappropriate for the situation, the
      Injunction shall be set aside. The original Judge is
      guilty of the Infraction of Wrongful Injunction, the
      penalty for which is 2 Blots; the CotC shall detect and
      report this penalty.

Appeal to Append an Injunction

      If the Board rules that an Injunction on the Judgement in
      question would be appropriate, and all members of the Board
      agree as to what Injunction to Append, the Injunction is made.
      Such an Injunction is legal if and only if it would have been
      legal, had it been made by the original judge.

      If the Board rules that an Injunction would not be appropriate,
      or does not agree as to which Injunction should be made, no
      Injunction is made.

Formal Apologies

      violation of one or more Rules, or to have committed one or more
      Crimes, and this CFJ is Judged TRUE, then the Ninny must submit
      to the Public Forum a Formal Apology within 72 hours of the
      publication of Judgement, unless that Judgement is successfully
      appealed within 72 hours.

      By a Formal Apology is meant a letter of at least 200 words,
      containing all of the Prescribed Words (if any were prescribed)
      explaining the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
      for self-improvement.

      A Judge deciding TRUE in such a CFJ may issue an Injunction
      including a list of up to ten Prescribed Words of the Judge's
      choice, and ordering that the Ninny's Formal Apology must
      include the Prescribed Words.

      If the Ninny fails to meet these criteria e shall gain 3 Blots.

Crimes and Infractions
  This Category includes general Rules regarding Crimes and
  Infractions.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1503/3 (Power=1)
Crimes and Infractions

      The Rules can penalize Players for performing, or failing to
      perform, some specific action.  Such penalized actions, or
      failures to act, are defined as either Crimes or Infractions.

      A Player shall only be subject to the penalty for a Crime after
      a CFJ has explicitly found that the Player has committed that
      Crime, or after an appeal to a Judgement finds so.

      A Player shall be subject to the penalty for an Infraction as
      soon as it is reported by the Player in charge of detecting
      that Infraction.

      There are no Crimes or Infractions outside those defined in the
      Rules.  If a Rule defines a Crime or Infraction without
      specifying an explicit penalty, or a class of penalty that is
      defined in the Rules, then that Crime or Infraction imposes no
      penalty.

      Any Rule that defines an Infraction must also specify a
      Player or Players who are authorized to detect and report
      the commission of that Infraction; otherwise, the Infraction
      carries no penalty.

      Any penalties reported by unauthorized persons have no effect.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1504/5 (Power=1)
Application and Timing of Crimes and Infractions

      When a CFJ determines that a Player has committed a Crime, the
      Judge is required to issue an Injunction requiring the Clerk of
      the Courts to execute Payment Orders required to apply the
      penalty specified for that Crime.

      If an appeal finds the Crime did not occur, the penalty shall
      not be applied.  If the penalty has already been applied, then
      the penalty shall be reversed to the extent possible immediately
      upon resolution of the appeal.

      Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their
      legal report, and the Player making the report of the Infraction
      shall execute whatever Payment Order(s) are required to apply
      the penalty specified for that Infraction.  If a CFJ later finds
      that the Infraction did not occur, the Judge of that CFJ is
      required to issue an Injunction requiring the Clerk of the
      Courts to vacate the Payment Order(s) originally executed to
      apply the penalty.

CFJ 939, Sep. 16, 1997: The provision in R1504 which states that:
      Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their
      legal report, and the Player making the report of the Infraction
      shall execute whatever Payment Order(s) are required to apply
      the penalty specified for that Infraction.
should be interpreted such that penalties for Infractions are applied
immediately upon the legal report of the *penalties*, not the legal
report of the Infractions.

Rule 1652/0 (Power=1)
Double Jeopardy

      No Player shall be subject to the application of more than one
      penalty for each specific instance of a particular Crime or
      Infraction.

      For any single act (or failure to act), a Player can only once
      be subject to the penalty of each Crime of Infraction resulting
      from that act.  If the penalties for any one Crime or Infraction
      are reversed upon appeal, such penalties may not be reinstated
      for that particular Crime or Infraction based upon that specific
      act.

      This Rule does not forbid the re-application of a penalty whose
      reversal is rescinded by CFJ or an appeal to a CFJ.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule that applies Crimes or
      Infractions, or the penalties thereof.

Rule 1681/2 (Power=1)
The Logical Rulesets

      There is a format of the Ruleset known as the Short Logical
      Ruleset (SLR).  In this format, each Rule is assigned to a Rule
      Category, and the Rules are grouped according to their Category.
      Within a Category, the ordering of Rules is decided by the
      Rulekeepor.  All existing Rule Categories must be listed, even
      if no Rules are currently assigned to the Category.

      The listing of each Rule in the SLR must include:
        * The Rule Number
        * The Rule's Amendment Number
        * The Rule's Power
        * The Rule's Title
        * The Rule's text
        * Any annotations to the Rule required by Injunction.

      The Rulekeepor is strongly encouraged not to include any
      additional information in the SLR, except that which increases
      the readability of the SLR.

      There is a format of the Ruleset known as the Full Logical
      Ruleset (FLR).  In this format, Rules are assigned to the
      same Category and presented in the same order as in the
      SLR.  The FLR must contain all the information required
      to be in the SLR, as well as:
        * A brief description of each Category
        * Any historical annotations which the Rulekeepor is
          required to record.

      The Rulekeepor is also free to include any other information
      which e feels may be helpful in the use of the Ruleset in the
      FLR.

      change, the source of the Change (that is, the Number of the
      Proposal and the Entity that proposed it, or Rule-- or other
      entity-- which mandated the Change), and the date upon which the
      change took effect.  Other Rules may require additional
      information to appear in an annotation for certain types of Rule
      Change.

      Such an annotation does not in any way affect the Rule itself,
      is not part of the text of the Rule, and is not a Rule Change in
      its own regard.  The Rulekeepor shall indicate all annotations
      in such a way that they are readily distinguished from the text
      of the Rule.

      When a Rule is repealed, all annotations attached to it are
      discarded, and need not appear in the published Ruleset.

      has a unique name.  The Agoraverse is the set of all Locations.

      There is a Property called Position, the value of which is a
      Location.  The Position of a Location is itself.  "An Entity's
      Location" is an unambiguous reference to that Entity's Position,
      and the Entity is said to be "at that Location".

      There is a Location named "the Origin".  The initial Location of
      any Entity with a Location is the Origin, unless otherwise
      specified.  If a Location ceases to be a Location, then the
      Location of all Entities at that Location becomes the Origin.

      All Players have a Location.

Definition of a Currency

      There are certain entities which are Currencies.  An entity is a

      Rules pertaining to Currencies.

      Neither Currencies nor units of Currency shall be created or

Rule 1478/2 (Power=1)
Executors

      The Executor of an entity is a Player who is empowered by the
      Rules to act on behalf of that entity, as if e was that entity.

      Except when the Rules stipulate otherwise, a Player is eir own
      Executor.  Any other entity has an Executor only when the Rules
      specify either a Player or a means to designate a Player to be
      the Executor of that entity.

      Whenever a Player is acting on behalf of some entity of which e
      is the Executor other than emself, e must make it clear that e
      is doing so.  If such a Player fails to clearly indicate that e
      is acting as the Executor of some other entity, it shall be
      presumed that e is acting on eir own behalf.

      A Nomic Entity (other than a person who is not a Player) which
      has no Executor, or whose Executor is not a Player, may not
      perform any action except when required to do so by the Rules.

      held by the various entities which possess units of that
      Currency.

      If the designated Recordkeepor of a Currency ceases to be a
      Player, the Speaker shall fulfill that responsibilty until a new
      Recordkeepor is selected according to whatever procedure
      applies.  If there is no procedure defined for selecting a new

      has Mint Authority if and only if granted it by the Rules.

      If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist, or ceases to have
      the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that Currency
      are destroyed, and that Currency ceases to exist.  The
      Recordkeepor of that Currency shall publically announce when
      this happens.

Rule 1722/0 (Power=1)
Minting of Currencies

      A new Currency is created when an entity which has Mint
      Authority posts to the Public Forum a message stating that e is
      doing so, provided that also e states in that message the values
      of all properties which the Rules require of Currencies.  The
      Mintor of a Currency created in this way is the entity which
      created it, any specification to the contrary notwithstanding.
      If the Recordkeepor of the Currency to be created is not the
      Executor of the Mintor, the proposed Recordkeepor must first
      consent to being its Recordkeepor before the Currency is
      created.

      A Currency is destroyed when Mintor of that Currency posts in
      the Public Forum stating that e is doing so, unless this
      destruction would be prohibited by the Rules.

      The Mintor of a Currency may not destroy that Currency if that
      Currency exists by virtue of being required to exist by the
      Rules.

      The Recordkeepor of a Currency created by the procedure in this
      Rule is changed when the Mintor of that Currency announces the
      change; but if the new Recordkeepor is not the Executor of the
      Mintor, the new Recordkeepor must first consent to being made
      Recordkeepor.

      that e is creating new units of that Currency, specifying the
      number of units that e is creating.  The newly created units are
      added to the Mintor's possessions.

      Units of Currency are destroyed when any entity which possesses
      units of that Currency transmits to the Recordkeepor of that
      Currency a notice that e is destroying units of that Currency,
      specifying the number of units that e is destroying.  An entity
      cannot destroy more units of a Currency than e possesses,
      however.  The units destroyed are removed from the possession of
      the entity performing the destruction.

Rule 1599/3 (Power=1)
Failure to Execute Payment Orders

      Whenever a Rule requires a Player execute a Payment Order, e is
      required to do so within seven days.  If a Player who is
      required to execute a Payment Order by the Rules fails to do so
      in the time required by this and other Rules, and a CFJ
      determines that this has in fact happened, the Judge of that CFJ
      shall make an Injunction requiring emself to execute the Order
      required in the stead of the nonperforming Player.  If a Player
      deregisters or goes On Hold without executing a Payment Order
      which e was required to execute, the Speaker shall execute it
      instead.

      If a Player who is required to execute a Payment Order executes
      it and then subsequently vacates it, e is still required to
      execute that Order, as if e had never executed it, unless e was
      required by the Rules to vacate that particular Order.

      This Rule defers to any Rule which specifies a different time
      limit for executing Payment Orders.

Rule 1598/5 (Power=1)
Transfer Orders

      A Transfer Order is an order requiring the Recordkeepor of a
      Currency to note the transfer of units of that Currency from one
      entity to another.  An Transfer Order specifies exactly one
      source entity, exactly one destination entity, exactly one
      Currency, and a number of units of that Currency which is a
      positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ.

      A Transfer Order is submitted when the Executor of the source
      entity specified in the Order transmits the Order to the
      Recordkeepor of the Currency specified in the Order, or whenever
      the Rules otherwise state that a Transfer Order is submitted.
      Unless otherwise specified, a Transfer Order is executed upon
      being submitted.  In no case may any Transfer Order be executed
      prior to its submission or without having ever been submitted.

      When a Transfer Order is executed, if the source possesses at
      least as many units of the specified Currency as specified in
      the Order, the number of units of that specified Currency shall
      be removed from the source entity and added to the destination
      entity.  Such an Order is said to have been successfully
      executed.

      However, if the source entity does not possess sufficient units
      of the specified Currency, then no transfer occurs, and the
      Recordkeepor shall, as soon as possible, notify the Executors of
      the source and destination that the Transfer Order was not
      successfully executed.

      Each Recordkeepor shall maintain a record of all Transfer Orders
      submitted which specify the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor, for at least four weeks after their execution.

      The determination, for the purpose of this Rule, of whether an
      entity has sufficient Currency to execute a transfer shall be
      made based on the Recordkeepor's records at the time the
      transfer is executed.  A Recordkeepor's good faith determination
      that a transfer has succeeded or failed is definitive, even if
      it is based on erroneous information.

Rule 1746/0 (Power=1)
Illegal Transfer Orders

      If it is determined by CFJ that the execution of a specific
      Transfer Order was in violation of the Rules or in violation of
      any other legal instrument granted binding force by these Rules,
      then:

      a) if the Transfer Order was executed to satisfy a Payment
         Order, the Judge of the CFJ shall vacate that Payment Order;

      b) otherwise, the Judge of the CFJ shall issue a Payment Order
         for an amount equal to the amount transferred illegally,
         naming as payor the recipient of the improper transfer and as
         payee the source of that transfer.

      However, the Judge shall not vacate a Payment Order under (a) if
      that Order has already been vacated, nor shall e issue a Payment
      Order under (b) if the improperly transferred Currencies have
      already been voluntarily refunded by the recipient of the
      improper transfer.

Rule 1730/0 (Power=1)
Delayed Transfer Orders

      If the Executor of the source entity specifies a later time
      (possibly implicitly) at which the Order is to be executed, then
      the Order is executed at that time, unless cancelled prior to
      that time.  An order of this latter type is called a "delayed
      Transfer Order."

      A delayed Transfer Order is cancelled when the Executor of its
      source entity transmits a message to the Recordkeepor cancelling
      that order.

      A Recordkeepor may reject a delayed Transfer Order by informing
      the Executor of the source entity of the Order that e is
      rejecting the Order because it is delayed (and for no other
      reason); if e does so, that Transfer Order is discarded and
      shall not be executed.  However, a Recordkeepor may not reject a
      delayed Transfer Order when e is specifically prohibited from
      rejecting such an Order.  In no case may a Recordkeepor reject a
      Transfer Order which is not delayed.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules pertaining to the
      execution of Transfer Orders, and the timing thereof.

      more Transfer Orders, as long as the action which is implicitly
      the submission of a Transfer Order is the sending of a message
      from the Executor of the source entity of the Transfer Order to
      the Recordkeepor of the Currency involved, or to the Public
      Forum.  Such implicitly submitted Transfer Orders may be delayed
      Transfer Orders, if the Rules which specify them as implicit
      Transfers Orders also specify them to be delayed.  A
      Recordkeepor may not reject a implicitly submitted delayed
      Transfer Order.

      Similarly, the Rules may specify that certain actions are also
      implicitly cancellations of certain types of delayed Transfer
      Orders, subject to the same restrictions specified above for

Rule 1596/2 (Power=1)
Payment Orders

      A Payment Order is an order requiring an entity (the payor) to
      submit a Transfer Order transferring units of a Currency from
      itself to some other entity (the payee).  A Payment Order
      specifies exactly one source entity, exactly one destination
      entity, exactly one Currency, and a number of units of that
      Currency which is a positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ.

      A Payment Order is executed when a Player with the authority to
      do so (as defined by the Rules) posts the Order to the Public
      Forum.

      A Player only has the authority to execute a Payment Order if e
      required to execute that Order by the Rules or by an Injunction,
      or if the Rules otherwise grant em authority to execute that
      Order.

      Each Recordkeepor shall maintain a record of all Payment Orders
      executed which specify the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor; this record shall also indicate, for each Order,
      whether that Order has been satisfied, is disputed, or has been
      vacated.  However, the Recordkeepor need only maintain records
      of satisfied or vacated Orders for four weeks after they have
      been satisfied or vacated.

      Transfer Order was being submitted for the purpose of satisfying
      the Payment Order in question.

      A given Payment Order can be satisfied at most once.  A vacated
      Payment Order cannot be satisfied.

      A given Transfer Order may be used for the purpose of satisfying
      at most one Payment Order.

      Board of Appeals for consideration.

      When a a COE regarding a Payment Order is accepted, the order
      shall be vacated (and an new order issued, if appropriate).  The
      Judge of a CFJ which finds that a Payment Order was illegally or
      improperly executed shall make an Injunction requiring the Clerk
      of the Courts to vacate the illegal Payment Order.

      vacated.  This notice must clearly identify the Payment Order
      being vacated.

      When a satisfied Payment Order is vacated, the Recordkeepor of
      the Currency in that Payment Order shall execute a new Payment
      Order identical to the vacated Payment Order, but with the payor
      and payee interchanged.

      A Player only has the authority to vacate a Payment Order if e
      is the Player who originally executed that Order, if e is
      required to vacate that Order by the Rules or by an Injunction,
      or if the Rules otherwise grant em the authority to vacate that

      vacated, and which is not subject to dispute.

      The Executor of an entity for which, at the beginning of a given
      Nomic week, there is at least one Overdue Payment Order naming
      it as Payor commits the Infraction of Persistent Indebtedness at
      the beginning of that Week.  If an entity has more than one
      Overdue Payment Order naming it as payor, its Executor commits
      as many such Infractions are there are different Currencies
      named in all these Overdue Payment Orders.

      The Recordkeepor of each Currency is authorized to report this
      Infraction with respect to the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor.  This Infraction carries a penalty of one Blot.

      With the exception of this paragraph, this Rule shall have no
      effect prior to the first day of December, 1997.

Rule 1661/3 (Power=1)
The Right of Patronage

      A Speaker who is not Tainted has the Right of Patronage.  This
      Right is the authority to, once a week, order the award of
      specific currencies from the Bank to specific Players, only as
      specified in this Rule.

      The Speaker exercises this right by posting to the Public Forum
      a Payment Order from the Bank to one Player in VTs for not more
      than 1 unit of any one Currency Minted by the Bank.  The Player
      to receive the award must not have received a Patronage award
      within the preceding four weeks, and the Speaker must provide a
      reason along with the Payment Order.

      Such awards are only permitted to recognize acts the Speaker
      believes to be of benefit of the Agora community, acts that the
      Speaker believes to exceed the call of duty, or acts that the
      Speaker believes to be of extreme sacrifice for the good of the
      Game.

Probate
  This Category includes Rules concerning entities in Probate.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1601/3 (Power=1)
Probate

      The Notary shall place in Probate any entity which possesses
      Units of Currency or which is named as the Payee or Payor of any
      Payment Order, which does not have an Executor, and which is not
      already in Probate, as soon as possible after being made aware
      of this condition.

      No entity may be destroyed while it possesses Units of Currency
      or while it is named as the Payee or Payor of any Payment
      Orders; any attempt to destroy an entity while it is in this
      condition shall be deferred until this condition no longer
      holds.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would destroy an
      entity while it possesses units of Currency.

      The following definitions apply with respect to entities in
      Probate:

      1. Assets: all units of Currency held by the entity in Probate,
         along with all Payment Orders naming the entity in Probate as
         payee.

      2. Debt: a Payment Orders naming the entity in Probate as payor.

      3. Credit: a Payment Order naming the entity in Probate as
         payee.

      4. Creditor: an entity which is the payee of a debt.

      5. Debtor: an entity which is the payor of a credit.

      6. Heir: an entity named in the Will (if any) of the entity in
         Probate.

      7. Estate: the assets and debts of the entity in Probate.

Rule 1637/2 (Power=1)
Wills

      A Will is an SLC.  The Jurisdiction of a Will is always empty.
      Each Will belongs to exactly one entity.  The Notary
      shall be the Maintainer of all Wills.

      A Will shall specify the heirs of the entity to which it
      belongs, and how the currencies possessed by that entity and
      its other assets will be divided amongst those heirs when that
      treasury is placed in Probate.  When an entity's Will is
      executed, the Executor in Probate of that entity will first
      submit all the Transfer Orders required by the Will (excepting
      those which e cannot execute or cannot execute successfully, for
      whatever reason), and will then divide the remaining residual
      assets as provided by the Will.

      A Will is created or amended by the Execution of an Application
      to Create a Will.  Such an Application must clearly identify the
      entity to which the Will is to belong, requires the
      Signature of the Executor of the entity to which the Will is
      to belong, and is Executed by submitting it to the
      Notary.  The effect of Executing such an Application is to
      create a Will belonging to that entity.  Any prior Will
      belonging to that entity is destroyed at the same time.

      A Will belonging to an Organization is not an SLC associated to
      that Organization, as defined elsewhere.

Rule 1738/3 (Power=1)
Executors in Probate

      Whenever there is an entity in Probate which does not have an
      Trustee, the Notary shall nominate a Player to be that entity's
      Trustee.  E shall announce this appointment in the Public Forum.

      As soon as possible after the Notary announces the appointment
      of a Trustee for an entity in Probate, each Recordkeepor, with
      respect to the Currency of which e is the Recordkeepor, shall
      provide to that Trustee an accounting of the number of units of
      that Currency held by the entity in Probate, and a list of all
      Payment Orders naming the entity in Probate as either Payor or
      Payee.

      As soon as possible after the Trustee has received all of the
      reports required by the previous paragraph, e shall formulate
      and announce in the Public Forum a Plan for the disposition of
      the estate of the entity in Probate according to the provisions
      of the Probate Code.  However, if the Trustee determines, during
      the course of constructing the Plan, that any of the credits or
      debts of the entity in Probate is disputed, e shall announce
      this fact in the Public Forum, and shall neither formulate nor
      announce a Plan until after the dispute has been settled, and
      shall do so as soon as possible after the dispute has been
      settled.

      If no legally-made objection to the Plan is posted in the Public
      Forum during a waiting period of seven days following its
      announcement, the Trustee shall, as soon as possible after the
      expiration of thia waiting period, perform whatever steps are
      necessary to implement the Plan for disposition.  If there is a
      legally-made objection, the Trustee shall, as soon as possible
      after the objection is announced, formulate and announce a new
      Plan as above, repeating the process until there is no
      objection.

      However, if a CFJ is made alleging that an objection to a
      Trustee's Plan lacks foundation, then the Trustee shall neither
      formulate a new Plan nor implement the existing Plan until the
      CFJ is resolved.  If a CFJ finds that an objection lacks
      foundation, then the Trustee may proceed as if that objection
      had never been made, and any attempt to announce that same
      objection again is not legally made.

      An objection to a Plan for disposition has foundation if it
      properly alleges that:
        a) the Plan constructed is not in accord with the provisions
           of the Probate Code;
        b) the Plan disregards the Will (if any) of the entity in
           Probate;
        c) the implementation of the Plan as constructed would be
           substantially unfair to a creditor or heir of the entity in
           Probate; or
        d) the Plan would not fully dispose of the estate of the
           entity in Probate.

Rule 1739/1 (Power=1)
The Probate Code

      The Plan for the disposition of the estate of an entity in
      Probate shall be constructed by its Trustee as detailed below.

      First, the Plan shall divide the assets of the estate amongst
      its creditors, assigning to each creditor assets equal to the
      amount due that creditor if possible, or a pro-rata portion if
      not.  All debts, whether satisfied in full or not, shall be
      cancelled.

      Next, if the entity in Probate is terminal, the Plan shall apply
      the Will, if any, of the entity in Probate to the extent
      possible.  Any assets remaining after the application of the
      Will shall be divided amongst the heirs named in the Will,
      assigning to each heir a portion computed in a manner consistent
      with the Will; if the Will is silent or unclear on the division
      of remaining assets, the division shall be equal.

      Next, if the entity in Probate is terminal, and there is no Will
      or the Will fails to fully dispose of all assets of the entity
      in Probate, the Plan shall then cancel all remaining credits and
      assign all remaining units of Currency to the Bank.

      Units of Currency are assigned to an entity by requiring a
      Transfer Order for those Units of Currency from the entity in
      Probate to that Entity.

      A credit is assigned to an entity by requiring a Payment Order
      from the payor of the credit to the entity to whom it has been
      assigned; however, if the payor of the credit is the same as the
      entity to whom it is to be assigned, no Payment Order shall be
      required.

      A debt is cancelled by requiring the vacation of the Payment
      Order which established it.

Implementation of Probate Plans

      The Trustee of an entity in Probate is empowered to submit on
      behalf of that entity whatever Transfer Orders are necessary to
      implement eir Plan for the disposition of that entity's Estate,
      as if e were that entity's Executor.  The Trustee may also
      execute and vacate Payment Orders when necessary to implement
      the Plan for the disposition of the Estate.

      The Trustee may exercise the above powers only when implementing
      a Plan for the disposition of the Estate of the entity in
      Probate of which e is the Trustee.

      The Trustee of an entity in Probate ceases to be Trustee when:
        a) e announces in the Public Forum that e resigns as Trustee;
        b) e ceases to be a Player;
        c) the entity of which e is Trustee ceases to be in Probate;
           or
        d) the Notary announces that e has been removed as Trustee.

      A Voting Entity Votes upon a Proposal when e, during the Voting
      Period of that Proposal, informs the Assessor of the Vote (or
      Votes) e is casting upon that Proposal.  This act also comprises

Style Points and the Wizard
  This Category includes Rules concerning Style Points and the
  Office of the Wizard.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1542/4 (Power=1)
Style Points

      There are Entities known as Style Points.  All Players possess
      an integral number of Style Points that is positive, negative or
      zero.  The number of Style Points a Player has is that Player's
      Style. Any new Player, or a Player with no recorded Style
      Points, begins with a Style of zero.

      Each Player also has a High Style Mark.  Any new Player, or a
      Player with no recorded High Style Mark, begins with a High
      Style Mark of zero.

      Every time a Proposal is distributed, the Wizard has the option
      of changing the Style of the Player who submitted that Proposal,
      as long as that Player is not the Wizard.  The Wizard may only
      change the Style of Players whose Proposals were distributed
      after e became Wizard.

      The Wizard may add or subtract up to three Style Points from the
      Proposer's Style for any reason having to do with the form,
      content, effects, or nature of the Proposal-- but, for the
      change to have effect, such reasons must be included in eir
      Wizard's Report, as provided for in other Rules.

      Whenever a Player's Style points exceeds eir High Style Mark by
      two or more points, the Wizard shall pay out to that Player a
      reward of one P-Note for every two points in excess of eir
      current High Style Mark and eir High Style Mark shall be
      increased by two times the number of P-Notes awarded.

      A Player's Style and High Style Mark can only change as provided
      for in this Rule.

  This Category includes Rules specifying the winner of the Game.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 112/2 (Power=3)
Ways to Win and Preclusions Thereof

      Ways for a Player to Win a Game may be defined by other Rules.
      Also, ways to prevent a Player from Winning a Game may be
      defined by other Rules. A Player Wins whenever a Win condition
      defined by one or more of those Rules occurs for that Player,
      provided that no Win-Preventing conditions are also occurring at
      that time for that Player.

      If no other Rule defining a way to Win exists, then a Player
      Wins upon each Winter and Summer Solstice, and upon each Vernal
      and Autumnal Equinox, with the Winner being chosen randomly by
      the Speaker from among all Voters not on Hold who are not
      ineligible to Win because of an applicable Win-preventing Rule.

Forfeiting the Game

      Players shall be permitted to forfeit the current Game by

Indulgences and Blots
  This Category includes Rules concerning Indulgences and Blots.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1435/4 (Power=1)
Definition of Indulgences, Blots and Immaculate

      Indulgences are a Currency.  The MUQ of Indulgences is 1.
      The Recordkeepor for Indulgences is the Herald.  The Mintor of
      Indulgences is the Bank.

      The Herald's Report includes the number of Indulgences possessed
      by each entity which possesses them, and the changes thereof
      since the last posting of the Herald's Report.

      A Payment Order for a number of Indulgences, the payee of which
      is the Bank, is known as that number of Blots.  When a Rule
      states that a Player is to gain some number of Blots, a Payment
      Order shall be executed with that Player as the payor, the Bank
      as the payee, and for a number of Indulgences equal to the
      number of Blots that Player is to receive.  This order is to be
      executed by whomever is required to report the change in Blots.

      A Player may be said to have a number of Blots equal to the sum
      of the amounts of all Payment Orders for Indulgences naming em
      as the payor and the Bank as payee, including orders which are
      disputed (but not those which have been vacated).  A Player with
      no such Payment Orders is Immaculate.  It is a Win-Preventing
      condition for a Player to have one or more Blots.

Rule 1712/4 (Power=1)
Distribution of Indulgences

      At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Herald shall randomly
      distribute a number of Indulgences equal to the number of Blots
      executed in the past Week, less the number of Blots vacated in
      the past Week, among all Players: for each such Indulgence, the
      Herald shall randomly select one Player and issue a Payment
      Order from the Bank to that Player for one Indulgence.  If this
      number is negative, no distribution occurs.

Rule 1714/2 (Power=1)
Lawlessness

      An Overdue Payment Order that is a number of Blots is that
      number of Overdue Blots.  A Lawless Player is a Player who has
      more than 30 Overdue Blots.

      Whenever a Player correctly alleges in the Public Forum that
      another Player is Lawless, the Lawless Player is removed from
      any Offices e holds, deregistered, and cannot reregister until a
      month has passed.

      If the Lawless Player was the Speaker, the Speaker-Elect first
      immediately becomes Speaker, and the old Speaker ceases to be
      Speaker.

      To incorrectly allege in the Public Forum that a Player is
      Lawless is the Crime of Persecution, a Class A Crime.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would prohibit a
      Lawless Player from being deregistered, or which would allow em
      to reregister.

[CFJ 1059: Rule 1714 should be interpreted such that an allegation of
 Lawlessness sent to the PF must contain an explicit declaration that
 a particular Player is Lawless.]

Rule 1747/0 (Power=1)
Pardoning Lawlessness

      The Clerk of the Courts has the power to Pardon Lawless Players.
      The Clerk may not exercise this power more than once per Nomic
      month, and may not Pardon the same Player twice in a given term
      of office (although, if re-elected later, he may again Pardon
      that Player).  The Clerk of the Courts Pardons a Player by
      announcing he is doing so in the Public Forum. At that time, the
      following events may occur:

        1) The Clerk of the Courts shall request the Herald to
           eliminate all Fugitive Blots owned by the Pardoned Player,
           and the Herald shall do so as soon as possible.

        2) The Clerk of the Courts may, if necessary, vacate any
           Payment Orders for Indulgences possessed by the Pardoned
           Player's estate in order to reduce the number of Blots
           possessed by the Player's estate to below the threshhold
           for Lawlessness. The CotC may not Vacate Payment Orders for
           X number of Indulgences if Vacating PO's for a lesser
           number of Indulgences would suffice to render the Player no
           longer Lawless.

        3) After the above two actions have been completed, the Player
           may immediately reregister.

        4) The Pardoned Player shall then post a Formal Apology to the
           Public Forum for his Lawlessness. The CotC may include a
           list of up to ten Prescribed Words in his Pardon.

        5) A Pardoned Player is not subject to Persistent Indebtedness
           penalties for three months after being Pardoned, but during
           this period he must apply all Indulgences received (from
           any source) to his debt and may not transfer them to
           another Entity.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule governing Lawlessness,
      Fugitive Blots, when a deregistered Player may reregister, or
      Persistent Indebtedness.

Rule 1439/5 (Power=1)
Blots Due to a CFJ

      If a Call For Judgement (CFJ) clearly alleging that a Player has
      violated a specific Rule is found to be TRUE, the Player
      receives Blots equal to the Power of the violated Rule rounded
      down to the nearest whole integer, or four Blots if its
      Power exceeds four.  This Rule defers to the wording of the
      violated Rule when it defines a Blot penalty in the specific
      case of a CFJ, or specifically forbids Blot penalties in the
      case of a CFJ.

      The Player who initially called for the CFJ has the Legal
      Responsibility to report Blots due to the CFJ to the Herald

      If such a Judgement is overturned upon appeal, then the
      Player who received Blots shall lose the same number of
      Blots as were given due to the initial Judgement of the
      CFJ.  The Player losing the Blots has responsibility for
      reporting that loss to the Herald.

Fugitives from Justice

      When an Player is deregistered from the game while not
      Immaculate, e becomes a Fugitive from Justice, and e receives
      Fugitive Blots equal to the number of Blots e then had.  The
      Herald shall keep a record of the number of Fugitive Blots
      attributed to each Fugitive from Justice.

      At the beginning of each month, the Herald shall halve the
      number of Fugitive Blots attributed to each Fugitive of Justice,
      rounding down; but no Fugitive from Justice shall have the
      number of Fugitive Blots attributed to em reduced to less than
      one by this method.

      When a Fugitive from Justice reregisters, the Herald shall
      assess against em a number of Blots equal to the number of
      Fugitive Blots attributed to em at the time of eir
      reregistration.  Eir Fugitive Blots are then removed.

Changing Speakers
  This Category includes Rules regulating changing the Speaker.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1647/2 (Power=1)
Office of the Speaker-Elect

      Let there be the Office of Speaker-Elect.  The Speaker-Elect has
      the duty to be the Speaker's successor.  Whenever a
      Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker, e ceases to be Speaker-Elect.
      The Speaker can never hold the Office of Speaker-Elect, even
      temporarily.

      The CotC and Justiciar may not Nominate for the Office of
      Speaker-Elect.

      When the Office of Speaker-Elect is to be held temporarily by a
      Player because of the Speaker-Elect becoming Speaker(or for any
      other reason,) the Office is filled according to the Order of
      Succession, as defined by other Rules, with the Speaker as
      Arbiter of Succession.

      The Speaker-Elect receives no salary for filling the Office of
      Speaker-Elect.

      This rule takes precedence over all other Rules defining the
      characteristics of the Office of Speaker-Elect.

Rule 1648/2 (Power=1)
When the Speaker is Tainted

      The Speaker is Tainted whenever the Player who is Speaker became
      Speaker by any means other than a normal Speaker transition.

      A normal Speaker transition occurs whenever the Rules require
      the Speaker-Elect to become Speaker, and the Office of
      Speaker-Elect is held in normal fashion.

      If the Rules require the Speaker-Elect to become Speaker, and
      that Office is held temporarily, the Speaker-Elect still becomes
      Speaker, but the resulting Speaker is Tainted.

      A Tainted Speaker may remain Speaker only until some other
      Player holds the Office of Speaker-Elect in normal fashion, at
      which point, the Speaker-Elect shall become Speaker.

Tainting the Speaker

      Tainting of the Speaker passes. Any Active Player is permitted
      to call such a Referendum at any time, by requesting such to the
      Public Forum.

      This Referendum must name the offending Speaker, and if that
      Player is Speaker upon passage of this Referendum, that Speaker
      is Tainted.

      For this Referendum the default procedure for Referenda is
      modified as follows: Vote Collector is the Registrar, Voting
      Entities do not include the Speaker, and its Adoption Ratio is
      2.

Rule 942/7 (Power=1)
Replacement of Impossible Speaker

      If a Speaker is determined by CFJ to have made further play
      impossible by eir actions or lack thereof, and the CFJ is not
      appealed within the allowed time, or if such a determination
      is made upon appeal of a CFJ; AND if the Speaker has not changed
      since the CFJ was made, then the Player who holds the Office
      of Speaker-Elect immediately becomes Speaker, and the old
      Speaker ceases to be Speaker.

      A Speaker who makes further play impossible by eir actions or
      lack thereof commits the Crime of Speaker Impossibility, a Class
      A Crime.

      "Impossible" is defined here to mean overwhelmingly psychotic
      behavior, a complete lack of interest in the Game, or
      uncooperativeness of the highest order. It does *not* include
      normal Speaker latitudes which have been taken by past Speakers
      for various reasons, whether justifiable or not, including but
      not limited to: temporary suspension of proposal distribution,
      resetting of scores, or accidental illegal actions. The Judge of
      the CFJ *must* take these extremely tight standards into
      account, and the accused Speaker *must* be given an opportunity
      to defend eirself.

      This Rule adds to the set of valid classes of Judgements, and
      takes precedence over other Rules which may attempt to prevent
      this class of Judgement.

Rule 786/6 (Power=1)
Rule of Succession for Speaker or Speaker-Elect

      When the Office of Speaker-Elect is to be filled temporarily
      according to the Order of Succession, that order is defined to
      be:

      the Promotor
      the Assessor
      the Justiciar
      the Clerk of the Courts
      the Rulekeepor
      the Registrar
      the Archivist
      all Officers in order of most recent registration
      all Active Players in order of most recent registration

      except that the Speaker does not appear in the Order.  The Order
      of Succession is determined at the time the Office is to be
      filled.

      Any Rule which requires the Office of Speaker-Elect to be filled
      according to the Order of Succession must specify an Arbiter
      of Succession; if it does not, the Speaker-Elect shall not be
      chosen according to that Rule. This Rule takes precedence over
      such Rules.  (If this would ever result in the Speaker filling

      instead be filled by the Order of Succession, with the Speaker
      as Arbiter of Succession.)

      When the Office of Speaker-Elect is to be filled, the Arbiter of
      Succession shall, as soon as possible, announce in the Public
      Forum that the Office of Speaker-Elect is being temporarily
      filled by this Rule.  Once this announcement has been made, each
      Player has three days to decline to fill the Office by sending a
      message to the Arbiter stating e does so.

      During this three day period, the Office of Speaker-Elect is
      held by that Active Player highest in the order of succession
      who has not yet declined to the Arbiter.  If there is only one
      Active Player in the order of succession who has not declined,
      that Player may not decline.

      At the end of the three days, the Office is filled by the Active
      Player highest on the list of succession who did not decline the
      Office, and that player may no longer decline.

      As soon as possible after, and within four days of, the filling
      the Office of Speaker-Elect, the Arbiter of Succession shall
      announce which Active Player is now the Speaker-Elect.

      Announcements by the Arbiter have no effect on the identity of
      the Speaker-Elect.

Rule 402/5 (Power=1)
Speaker Transition

     Whenever the Rules call for the Speaker-Elect to become Speaker:

       1) The Speaker shall forward copies of all necessary materials
          for the performance of eir position, as soon as possible to
          the Speaker-Elect.
       2) The Speaker-Elect shall acknowledge the receipt of said
          materials as soon as possible after step 1.
       3) As soon as possible after step 2, the Speaker shall post a
          message to the Public Forum announcing that the
          Speaker-Elect has become the Speaker.  At the "Date:" of
          the Speaker's posting, the old Speaker shall cease to be
          Speaker and the Speaker-Elect shall become the Speaker.

      If the Speaker-Elect changes before the completion of this
      procedure, it must be begun again from step 1.

      If another Rule specifies that the Speaker-Elect becomes
      Speaker before the completion of step 3, such as the case when
      the Rules require an immediate Speaker transition, then this
      Rule defers to it, and the procedure above need not be
      completed.

      However, in any case where the above procedure is not completed
      before a transition of Speakers takes place, the new Speaker is
      still obliged to make a reasonable effort to obtain all
      materials necessary for the performance of eir duties from the
      former Speaker.  If this is not possible, then the new Speaker
      shall make a reasonable attempt to recover this information from
      other sources. (The Players, the Officers, the Archivist etc.)

Subordinate Legal Codes

      A Subordinate Legal Code (SLC) is a body of law organized under

      status by the Rules and it meets all other requirements in the

Precedence of SLCs

      Unless otherwise specified by the Rules, older SLCs take

Rule 1591/0 (Power=1)
Jurisdiction of SLCs

      A SLC has the power to constrain the actions of Players in
      the same manner as the Rules.  However, a SLC has power over
      only those Players within its Jurisdiction, as defined in the
      Rules authorizing that SLC.

      The Jurisdiction of a SLC must be specified by the Rules,
      either directly or indirectly.  If the Jurisdiction of a SLC
      might vary over the course of the existence of the SLC, the
      Rules must specify a Player who is required to maintain a record
      of which Players are within the Jurisdiction of that SLC.

Rule 1594/0 (Power=1)
Violation of SLCs

      A Player who is within the Jurisdiction of a SLC is required to
      abide by it while e remains within its Jurisdiction, unless
      doing so would violate either the Rules or another SLC with
      higher precedence.

      A Player who fails to abide by a SLC is in violation of that
      SLC.  A Player who is found by a CFJ to have violated a SLC
      shall suffer whatever penalties specified in the Rules
      authorizing the violated SLC, or, if there is no such penalty
      specified, a default penalty of three Blots, to be reported by
      the Judge of the CFJ.

      There shall be no additional penalty imposed upon a Player who
      violates this Rule by violating a SLC; this Rule takes
      precedence over any Rule which specifies penalties for violating
      Rules.

Rule 1457/10 (Power=1)
Judicial Procedure for Violations of an SLC

      When any Player believes that a Subordinate Legal Code (SLC) has
      been violated by a Player within the SLC's Jurisdiction e shall
      inform the Maintainer of that SLC of that belief, along with the
      nature of the violation, the violated text of the SLC, and the
      identity of the violating Player. The Maintainer shall then, as
      soon as possible, distribute this information to all Players
      within the Jurisdiction of the violated SLC.

      If, within 72 hours of this distribution, no Player within the
      SLC's Jurisdiction disputes the claim, the Maintainer shall
      declare the SLC violated.  The Maintainer is then allowed to
      initiate any corrections and penalties allowed by the Rules and
      the violated SLC.

      If, any Player under the SLC's Jurisdiction disputes the claim
      of violation within 72 hours, then any Player may submit a Call
      for Judgement, alleging that a specific Player has violated the
      SLC. Such a CFJ cannot be made in any other circumstance.

      All Players within the SLC's Jurisdiction are automatically
      ineligible to Judge such a CFJ.

      Whenever such a CFJ is found TRUE, the SLC has been violated and
      the SLC's Maintainer shall perform the same duties as when no
      Player contests the claim. If such a TRUE Judgement is
      overturned on Appeal, those actions shall be reversed to the
      extent possible immediately upon the resolution of the appeal.

Rule 1590/1 (Power=1)
Maintainer of SLCs

      For a SLC to be legally authorized, the Rules must specify a
      Player who is required to maintain a record of the content of
      that SLC; this Player is known as the Maintainer of that SLC.

      The Maintainer of a given SLC must provide a copy of it to any
      other Player who requests it, as soon as possible after the
      request is made.  If the SLC has changed between the time of the
      request and the time the Maintainer fulfills the request, the
      Maintainer must provide the SLC as it existed at the time of the
      request and must additionally document every change made to the
      Compact between the time of the request and the time of its
      fulfillment.

      The Maintainer of an SLC must also provide an updated copy of
      the SLC to all Players within its Jurisdiction as soon as
      possible after the SLC changes for any reason.

[CFJ 860: It is sufficient for the Rules to name an Officer as

      An valid ACO is Executed by submitting it to the Notary or by
      being sent to the Public Forum.

      The effect of Executing a valid ACO is to create the prospective
      Organization, with the signatories as its Foundors.  The
      Foundors then come under the Jurisdiction of that Organization's
      SLC.

      An ACO shall only be valid if its contents are not in conflict

       ii) The continued existence of the Organization would require
           that the Organization have no legal Administrator.
      iii) The continued existence of the Organization would require

       iv) The continued existence of the Organization would require
           that the Organization have no legal Maintainer for its SLC.
        v) The SLC of the Organization requires the Organization to
           dissolve.  This is a Voluntary Dissolution, all other
           dissolutions are Administrative Dissolutions.

      Dissolution takes place.

      As soon as possible after an Organization dissolves, for any
      reason, the Notary shall report that dissolution to the Public

Contests

      There is a class of Organization known collectively as the class
      of Contests.  Each single Organization within this class is a
      Contest.  The SLC associated with a Contest are that Contest's
      Regulations.  A Contest's Administrator is that Contest's

      the Jurisdiction of that Group's SLC, other than the
      Contestmaster.

      Any Player is permitted to be a Contestant or a Contestmaster of
      any Contest, unless that would conflict with that Contest's
      Regulations, or the Rules. A Contest must have exactly one
      Foundor, who becomes the Contest's initial Contestmaster.

      The ACO to create a Contest must be Posted to the Public Forum
      to have effect.

      Each Contest has Mint Authority.

[CFJ 760: If the Regulations specify that the position of
 Contestmaster is to be vacated, that is without effect.
 CFJ 800: A Contest need not be a game in the strict sense of the
 word.]

Regulations and Membership of Contests

      No Player within Jurisdiction of a Contest's Regulations is
      bound to obey any Regulation or combination of Regulations that
      conflict with the Rules.

      The Regulations can specify the following:

        i) How a Contestmaster is replaced. No person may become
           Contestmaster without eir consent.  If left unspecified,
           the Contestmaster cannot change while the Contest exists.
       ii) How the Currencies in the Contest Fund shall be spent.  If
           this is not specified, they may only be spent when the
           Rules require it.
      iii) The amount of the Entry Fee for the Contest, in the form of
           units of any specific Currency.
       iv) Additional restrictions on Players to become Contestants,
           and conditions under which Contestants cease to be
           Contestants.

      A Player becomes a Contestant by notifying the Contestmaster and
      paying the prescribed Entry Fee to the Contest Fund.  A
      Contestant may quit a Contest at any time by so notifying the
      Contestmaster.  A Contestmaster may resign at any time by
      posting a message to that effect to the Public Forum, at which
      time e ceases to be Contestmaster.

The Silly Proposal

      During the week in which e is a Silly Person, the Silly Person
      is obligated to produce a Silly Proposal and publish it in the
      Public Forum, as well as submit it for a vote.  A Proposal is a
      Silly Proposal only if it is clearly marked as such when
      published and submitted.  No Proposals by Players other than the
      Silly Person are Silly Proposals, nor are any further Proposals
      offered by the Silly Person in a Nomic Week in which e has
      already proposed a Silly Proposal.

      The Silly Proposal's sole contents must be one of the following:

        i) A limerick.
       ii) A rhymed poem no longer than fourteen lines. (No free
           verse!)
      iii) A joke of no more than a hundred words.
       iv) A truly hideous pun.

      The Silly Proposal has an AI=2 and has the effect of giving its
      Proposer 1 VT if adopted. (The Assessor shall take note and
      report this Silly VT.)

      If the Silly Proposal is adopted unanimously, then the Patent
      Title of Grande Foole is bestowed upon the Player who proposed
      it.  This title is held by this Player until some other poor
      fool has it thrust upon them.

      If the Silly Person does not produce a Silly Proposal during the
      week in which e is the Silly Person, then he is guilty of the
      Infraction of Seriousness, with the penalty of 0.5 VT. This may
      be detected and reported by any Player.

Rule 1454/4 (Power=1)
The Virus

      There is a Nomic Entity called the Virus which has the effect
      of altering the texts of Rules, in the manner and under the
      conditions set out below. This process is known as "infection".
      The effect of the Virus on a Rule, when it has an effect, is
      that of a non-Proposed Amendment to that Rule. Thus, the Virus
      can only be effective inasmuch as it satisfies the Rules for
      the effectiveness of non-Proposed Rule Changes.

      The selection of the Rule to be infected by the Virus occurs as
      follows: as soon as possible after the beginning of each Nomic
      Week, the Rulekeepor shall select a random integer in the range
      [M,N], where M and N are, respectively, the numbers of the
      lowest and highest numbered Rules at the beginning of that
      week. Call a number selected in this way a Virus Number.  If
      the Virus Number selected is the number of a Rule, then that
      Rule is infected as described below, and no further Virus
      Numbers are selected in that week. If the Virus Number is not
      the number of a Rule, then a new Virus Number is selected as
      above, unless five such Virus Numbers (none of which is the
      number of a Rule) have already been selected in that week. In
      that case, the Virus is ineffective and no Rule is infected in
      that week.

      The Rulekeepor shall publish the results of the selection
      process in the Public Forum within 24 hours of the completion
      of that process. If a Rule has been infected, e shall announce
      the number of that Rule. If no Rule has been infected, then e
      shall announce that no Rule has been infected.

      Given that other Rules permit it, an infected Rule is amended
      by appending to it the following paragraph: "This Rule, apart
      from this paragraph, shall be completely without effect. Two
      weeks after this paragraph is inserted into this Rule, this
      paragraph shall be deleted from this Rule."

      There is one exception to the above: if this Rule is the
      infected Rule, then this Rule automatically Repeals itself.

      All Rule Changes by the Virus shall be Unattributed.

Rule 1667/3 (Power=1)
Origination of Rules

      Every Rule has one Originator.

      The Originator of a Rule is the Entity responsible for that
      Rule's text as it first appeared in the Ruleset.  The Originator
      of all Rules in the Initial Ruleset is Peter Suber. In the case
      of a Rule resulting from a proposed Rule Change, the Originator
      of that Rule is the Entity that proposed the Creation of the
      Rule. In the case of a Rule Created by a non-proposed Rule
      Change, the Originator of that Rule is the Rule that mandated
      the non-proposed Creation of the Rule.

      The Originator of a Rule shall not change.

Rule 1668/1 (Power=1)
Authorship of Rules

      Every Rule has one or more Authors.

      An Author of a Rule is an Entity responsible for some
      substantial portion of either the Rule's text, or its meaning,
      as it currently appears in the Ruleset.

      The first Author of any Rule is that Rule's Originator.

      Whenever a proposed Amendment makes more than a cosmetic change
      to a Rule, the Entity which proposed the Amendment becomes an
      Author of that Rule.

      If a non-proposed Amendment makes more than a cosmetic change to
      a Rule, the Rule that mandated the non-proposed Rule Change
      becomes an Author of that Rule.

      An Entity cannot become Author of a Rule as a result of an
      Amendment that did not apply to that Rule.  An Entity also
      cannot become Author of a Rule as a result of an Amendment that
      the Rules explicitly state is to be Unattributed.  All cosmetic
      Amendments are to be Unattributed.

      For Purpose of this Rule, the Rulekeepor shall be final arbiter
      of what constitutes a "substantial portion" of a Rule's text or
      meaning, and what constitutes only a "cosmetic" change.
      However, any change to a Rule that alters the way that Rule is
      applied, or alters more than half the text of a Rule, shall be
      deemed by the Rulekeepor as substantial, and any change that
      makes no alteration in either the semantic content or the
      application of a Rule shall be deemed by the Rulekeepor as
      cosmetic.

      If, after any Rule Change, the Rulekeepor feels that the
      contribution of any particular Author is completely absent from
      a Rule's text or meaning, then that Entity can be removed as an
      Author from that Rule. This shall be determined at the
      Rulekeepor's discretion.

      The Rulekeepor is permitted to follow any procedure e deems
      appropriate in making determinations required by this Rule. E is
      also permitted to reverse emself if e feels the circumstances
      merit it.

      Executor in Probate, the Notary shall nominate a Player to be
      that entity's Executor in Probate.  E shall announce this
      appointment in the Public Forum.

      The Executor in Probate of an entity is not its Executor, but
      is empowered to submit for that entity any Transfers Orders
      required by the Probate Code, with the same effect as if e
      were its Executor.  This Rule takes precedence over any other
      Rule which would prohibit Transfer Orders, if submitted in
      accordance with the Probate Code, from being effective.

      An Executor in Probate also has the power to execute and
      vacate certain Payment Orders, as specified by the Probate
      Code.

      The Executor in Probate of an entity shall, upon eir nomination,
      arrange for the disposal of that entity's assets and debts,
      according to the procedures specified in the Probate Code, and
      shall do so in a timely manner.

      The Executor in Probate of an entity ceases to be its Executor
      in Probate when e announces, in accordance with the Probate
      Code, that the entity is no longer in Probate, or when e
      announces that e resigns as that entity's Executor in Probate.

      Section 2. Procedure for Fair Division
d6139 1
a6139 3
      When an amount of Currency (either as units in possession of the
      estate, or units due the estate as credits) is to be divided,
      the following procedure shall be used:
d6141 2
a6142 17
      1. The Executor in Probate shall first divide the amount of
         Currency amongst the creditors of the estate proportionally
         to the residual debts of each creditor, rounding each share
         down to the appropriate MUQ.  The surplus is the amount
         remaining after this initial division is completed.
      2. The surplus, if any, shall then be added to the share of the
         creditor with the greatest remaining residual debt whose
         share does not already equal eir remaining residual debt.  In
         the event of a tie, the Executor in Probate shall select a
         creditor at random.  If there is no such creditor, the
         surplus is retained.  This step shall be repeated until there
         is no more surplus, or no more creditors with residual debt
         unequal to their share.
      3. If at any time in the above process, any portion of any
         creditor's share exceeds eir residual debt, this excess
         portion shall be removed from eir share and added to the
         surplus.
d6144 6
a6149 1
      Section 3. Distribution of Assets to Creditors
d6151 3
a6153 5
      For each Currency of which the estate possesses units, the
      Executor in Probate shall divide those units according to the
      procedure in Section 2, and shall submit Transfer Orders from
      the estate to each creditor for the amount of that creditor's
      share.
d6155 6
a6160 82
      Section 4. Reassignment of Credits to Creditors

      For each debtor of the estate, in an order to be determined by
      the Executor in Probate, the Executor in Probate shall determine
      the sum of the credits due the estate from that debtor
      (separately for each Currency), and shall divide that sum
      amongst the creditors according to the procedure in Section 2,
      and shall execute Payment Orders from that debtor to each
      creditor for the amount of that creditor's share.  If there is a
      surplus amount, the Executor in Probate shall execute a Payment
      Order from the creditor to the estate for the amount of the
      surplus.  The Executor in Probate shall then vacate the credits
      thus reassigned.

      Section 5. Discharge of Residual Debts

      The Executor in Probate shall vacate all remaining debts of the
      estate.

      Section 6. Distribution of Residual Assets to Heirs

      This step is skipped if the estate is not terminal.

      The Executor in Probate shall execute the provisions of the Will
      of the estate, if a Will exists.  If residual assets exist after
      the execution of the Will, the Executor in Probate shall
      distribute them to the heirs of the estate in the manner
      described in Sections 3 and 4, except that heirs replace
      creditors, and each heir is considered to have residual debt
      computed according to the provisions for division as specified
      in the Will (or equal to the residual assets divided equally, if
      there is no provision).

      Section 7. Remission of Unclaimed Assets

      This step is skipped if the estate is not terminal.

      For each Currency, the Executor in Probate shall submit a
      Transfer Order from the estate to the Mintor of that Currency
      for all the units of that Currency remaining in the estate,
      excepting any units which cannot be transferred for any reason.
      The Executor in Probate shall also vacate any remaining credits
      of the estate at this time.

      Section 8. Destruction of Immobile Assets

      This step is skipped if the estate is not terminal.

      The Executor in Probate shall destroy any units of Currency
      which remain in the estate.

      Section 9. Termination of Probate

      The Executor in Probate shall announce that Probate of the
      estate is complete.

      Section 10. Definitions

      The following definitions are used throughout this Rule.

      1. Estate: the entity in Probate.

      2. Debt: A Payment Order which names the estate as payor.

      3. Credit: A Payment Order which names the estate as payee.

      4. Creditor: an entity which is the payee of a debt.

      5. Debtor: an entity which is the payor of a credit.

      6. Residual debt of a creditor: the total of the amounts of the
         debts for which that creditor is the payee, less the sum of
         all amounts transferred from the estate to that creditor
         according to Section 3, and the amounts of all credits
         reassigned to that creditor according to Section 4.

      7. Residual assets: the total of the units of Currency held by
         the estate and the credits of the estate, after the steps in
         Sections 3, 4, 5 have been completed.

      Note: Residual debt and residual assets are computed
      independently for each Currency involved.

======================================================================
Frankenstein
  This Category includes the various Rules relating to the
  Frankenstein Monster.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1671/92 (Power=1)
The Frankenstein Rule

      There is a Nomic Entity known as a Frankenstein Monster.  A
      Frankenstein Monster only has properties and effects as defined
      in this Rule.  This Rule shall be known as the Frankenstein
      Rule, and can be referred to unambiguously in that manner.  This
      is the first paragraph.

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of any message sent to the Public Forum or
      in response to a request for information which that Player is
      required to provide commits the Crime of Frankenstein Monster, a
      Class C Crime.

      If that Player's Frankenstein Monster contains at least five Mil
      for each Blot to be removed, then that number of Mil is
      transferred from the Player's Frankenstein Monster, and the
      Blots are removed; otherwise, no Mil are transferred and no
      Blots are removed.

      If a Frankenstein Monster is defined as a Voting Entity then
      it is permitted to cast Voting Tokens on Proposals as if it
      were a Player.

      No Entity is permitted to vote on a Proposal unless it is a
      Frankenstein Monster, and only those Entities designated by the
      Rules to be Frankenstein Monsters are Frankenstein Monsters.

      Any Frankenstein Monster who is not Tainted is permitted to,
      once in any given Nomic Week, choose one specific Proposal (that
      e is otherwise eligible to vote for) and cast one vote in
      addition to any others e is permitted to cast on that Proposal.

      A SLC is permitted to define its own Frankenstein Monsters for
      changing its own content, and any change to a SLC adopted in
      accordance with its own Frankenstein Monsters is legal.

      Frankenstein Monsters are permitted to submit Statements for
      Judgement to the Game of InterNomic.

      A Contest's Administrator is that Contest's Frankenstein
      Monster.

      A Group with fewer than three Frankenstein Monsters is not
      entitled to cast Votes.

      The Frankenstein Monster shall receive a weekly salary
      equal to 1.5 times the Basic Officer Salary.

      There shall exist the Frankenstein Monster of Rulekeepor.

      The Notary's Report includes:

        i) The Name and class of each Frankenstein Monster.
       ii) The identities of the Administrator and Executor of each
           Frankenstein Monster.
      iii) The Players within the Jurisdiction of each Frankenstein
           Monster's SLC.
       iv) The identity of the Maintainer of each Frankenstein
           Monster's SLC.

      This is the last paragraph. This Rule can only be subject to a
      Rule Change as described by the Frankenstein Generator.  This
      Rule takes precedence over all other Rules that would otherwise
      allow this Rule to be changed in any manner whatsoever.

Rule 1672/2 (Power=1)
The Frankenstein Generator

      This Rule shall be known as the Frankenstein Generator, and can
      be referred to unambiguously in that manner.  This Rule
      specifies the only ways in which the Frankenstein Rule can
      undergo a Rule Change.

      Rule Changes to the Frankenstein Rule must conform to the
      following restrictions:

        i) The Frankenstein Rule cannot be repealed.

       ii) No Rule Change can add text to the Frankenstein Rule unless
           it adds that text between the first and last paragraphs of
           the Rule.

      iii) No Rule Change can alter, add, or remove text from the
           first or last paragraphs of the Frankenstein Rule.

       iv) If the Frankenstein Rule explicitly forbids a specific
           property or effect to the Frankenstein Monster, no Rule
           Change can be adopted that grants the Frankenstein Monster
           that property or effect. (Deletion of the language
           forbidding that property or effect does not grant that
           property or effect.)

        v) If the Frankenstein Rule explicitly grants a specific
           property or effect to the Frankenstein Monster, no Rule
           Change can be adopted that denies the Frankensein Monster
           that property or effect.  (Deletion of the language
           granting that property or effect does not deny that
           property or effect.)

       vi) No Amendment can be applied to the Frankenstein Rule that
           is substantially the same as any prior successfully applied
           Amendment to the Frankenstein Rule.

      vii) All proposed Amendments to the Frankenstein Rule must
           consist of a single sentence of additional text specifying
           the properties and effects of a Frankenstein Monster, to be
           inserted between the first and last paragraphs. No proposed
           Amendment changing existing text beyond such an insertion
           shall be applied to the Frankenstein Rule, and no other
           proposed Rule Changes shall be applied to the Frankenstein
           Rule.

     viii) Whenever a Win by Pitchfork is legally announced by the Mad
           Scientist, all text between the first and last paragraphs
           of the Frankenstein Rule shall be deleted from the
           Frankenstein Rule.

       ix) Any Non-proposed Rule Changes not specified in this Rule,
           can only be applied to the Frankenstein Rule by the
           Frankenstein Mutator, as described by that Rule.

      No Rule Changes are permitted to this Rule that would alter, in
      any way, the restrictions this Rule makes on the Rule Changes
      that can be applied to the Frankenstein Rule.  This Rule takes
      precedence over any Rule permitting Rule Changes to the
      Frankenstein Rule other than those described in this Rule, and
      over any Rule that would permit Rule Changes forbidden by this
      Rule.

Rule 1673/3 (Power=1)
The Frankenstein Mutator

      This Rule shall be known as the Frankenstein Mutator, and can be
      referred to unambiguously in that manner.  This Rule specifies
      the way in which the Frankenstein Rule shall undergo
      non-proposed Rule Changes.  All Rule Changes mandated by this
      Rule shall be subject to the restrictions that the Frankenstein
      Generator makes on Rule Changes in general.

      Once a week the following Rule Changes shall occur to the
      Frankenstein Rule:

       i) If there are at least ten sentences between the first and
          last paragraphs of the Frankenstein Rule, then N of those
          sentences shall be deleted as follows.  Here, N is 1/10
          of the number of sentences between the first and last
          paragraphs of the Frankenstein Rule prior to the deletion,
          rounded down to the nearest integer.
          1) The Mad Scientist shall randomly select 2N different
             sentences from those between the first and last
             paragraphs of the Frankenstein Rule.
          2) The Mad Scientist shall choose N of the sentences
             selected in step i.1, and those sentences shall be
             deleted from the Frankenstein Rule.

      ii) One sentence shall be inserted between the first and last
          paragraph of the Frankenstein Rule in the following manner;
          1) The Mad Scientist selects a Rule, at random, from among
             all Rules in the Ruleset.
          2) The Mad Scientist shall select any one complete sentence
             e wishes from within the randomly selected Rule.
          3) The Mad Scientist shall select any noun (which can be a
             compound of two or more words) e wishes from within the
             selected sentence.
          4) The Mad Scientist shall replace each instance of the
             selected noun with the noun "Frankenstein Monster". (Or
             its plural, possessive, or other form if appropriate.)
          5) As long as the resulting sentence conforms to the
             restrictions that the Frankenstein Generator makes upon
             proposed Amendments, the sentence shall be inserted, at
             any point the Mad Scientist wishes, between the first and
             last paragraphs of the Frankenstein Rule.

      The Mad Scientist shall make the above selections as soon as
      possible after the beginning of each Nomic Week.  E shall
      publish the resulting Rule Changes in the Public Forum within 24
      hours after these selections are made.

Rule 1674/2 (Power=1)
The Mad Scientist

      There is the Office of Mad Scientist.  The Mad Scientist has the
      duty of the oversight of the Frankenstein Rules and the
      Frankenstein Monster.

      The Mad Scientist shall keep a Record of all successfully
      applied Proposed Amendments to the Frankenstein Rule, their
      Proposal Numbers, and the identity of the Entities who Proposed
      them.  E shall keep a record of all successfully applied
      non-proposed Rule Changes to the Frankenstein Rule.  And E shall
      also record the number of sentences between the first and last
      paragraphs of the Frankenstein Rule.

      The Mad Scientist shall post, in the Public Forum, any
      non-proposed Rule Changes to the Frankenstein Rule as soon as
      possible after they occur.

Deregistration due to Absence

a1161 21
      Each Player is exactly one of Not Absent, Maybe Absent, Absent
      or Abandoning.  Whenever a Player posts to the Public Forum, or
      a new Player registers, e becomes Not Absent.

      If a Player posts to the Public Forum clearly identifying a
      particular Active Player, and alleging that that Player has
      Abandoned the game, then the Player alleged to have Abandoned
      becomes Maybe Absent.  If a Player has been Maybe Absent
      continuously for two weeks, e becomes Absent.  If a Player has
      been On Hold continuously for sixty days, e becomes Absent.

      Any Player can cause any Absent Player to become Abandoning by
      stating that e is doing so in the Public Forum.

      If the Speaker ever becomes Abandoning, e commits the Class A
      Crime of Speaker Abandonment, e ceases to be Speaker, and the
      Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker.

      If any Player becomes Abandoning, e is deregistered, and the
      Registrar shall As Soon As Possible announce such in the Public
      Forum.

      An Application is any body of text designated as such by its
      creator, provided that its creator is a Player.  Once created,
      an Application may not be changed, except by adding Signatures
      to it or striking Signatures from it.

      An Application is destroyed and ceases to exist 14 days after
      its creation unless Executed before that time.  Once Executed, a
      Application cannot be changed in any way or destroyed except as
      required by the Rules.

Execution of Applications

      An Application is Executed when its creator sends it to the
      Officer or other Player specified in the Rules pertaining to
      that type of Application (or to the Public Forum), clearly
      indicating that e is Executing it at that time.  An Application
      cannot be Executed in any other way.

      The effect of Executing an Application is determined by the
      Rules pertaining to that type of Application.  Executing an
      Application of a type not defined by the Rules has no effect.

      In addition, sending a message, by any medium or combination of
      media, to every Active Player, is equivalent to sending it to
      the Public Forum, provided that the message bears a clear
      indication that it is intended to be a message to the Public
      Forum, and it is verifiable that the message was in fact sent to
      every Active Player.

Rule 1602/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Definition of Post and Synonyms Thereof

      Whenever the Rules calls upon some Player to "announce", "post",
      or "distribute" some communication or notification, this shall
      be accomplished by posting the communication or notification to
      the Public Forum.

      This Rule defers to any Rule which specifies some other means of
      announcing, posting, or distributing a communication or
      notification.

Definition of Violation

      If a Player performs an action which is prohibited by any Rule,
      or any other body of text which is defined to have the same
      force as a Rule, that action shall be known as a Rules
      Violation.

      Before a body of text is permitted to have the same force as a
      Rule with regards to a particular Player, said body of text
      shall have previously been made available to that Player.

Rule 1021/4 (Mutable, MI=1)
Mutability Indices

      Let there be, associated with each Rule, an Index called that
      Rule's Mutability Index.  The Mutability Index of a Rule is a
      part of that Rule, and cannot be changed except by the
      application of a Rule Change of a type that the Rules state can
      change a Rule's Mutability Index.

      The Mutability Index of a Rule can never be changed such that it
      is less than 1 or greater than 4; any Rule Change which would do
      so does not have legal effect.

      A Rule whose Mutability Index is 1 is known as a "Mutable" Rule.
      All other Rules are known as "Semimutable" Rules.

      An Absent Voter is deregistered when any other Player correctly

      Whenever a Player publically alleges the Absence of a Voter, the

      (unless the Voter alleged to be absent is the Registrar, in
      which case the Speaker shall do so), and announce that

      Registrar (or Speaker, as appropriate) to post a timely

      of a Voter correctly alleged to be Absent.

      This Rule in no way precludes a Player from being deregistered

Rule 1550/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Vote of Confidence Directive

      There is a Directive known as a Vote of Confidence (VOC).  A
      Proposal containing a VOC Directive has an Adoption Index (AI)
      of one, or greater if another Rule requires a higher AI for the
      Proposal.
d1316 5
a1320 11
      A VOC Directive must unambiguously specify a valid Official
      Document of Agora Nomic, as specified in other Rules.  If a VOC
      Directive specifies a Document that is not valid, or a Document
      that is no longer valid at the time of the Adoption of the
      Proposal containing the Directive, the Directive shall have no
      effect, even if its Proposal is Adopted.

      When the Rules refer to the "Adoption" of a VOC Directive, they
      mean that the VOC Directive was contained in a Proposal that was
      Adopted, and that the VOC Directive was allowed to have effect
      by this and other Rules.
d1324 5
d1332 2
a1333 11
Rule 1551/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Adoption of a VOC Directive

      Adoption of a Vote of Confidence (VOC) Directive conforms the
      Game State to what it would be if the valid Official Document
      specified within the VOC Directive was completely true and
      accurate at the time of the Document's publication in the Public
      Forum.  i.e. the State of the Game upon Adoption becomes that
      specified within the Document, plus all subsequent legal changes
      between the time of its publication and the Adoption of the VOC
      Directive.
d1335 32
a1366 25
      All Game State changes due to a VOC Directive occur upon passage
      of the Directive. A VOC Directive does not have retroactive
      effects.

      A Document specified within an Adopted VOC Directive is true and
      accurate. The Game State it references may not be retroactively
      modified prior to the time it was published in the Public Forum,
      even to reflect a prior mistake, retracted or illegal move, or
      an Injunction.  This Rule takes precedence over any Rule that
      would allow such retroactive alterations or corrections to the
      Game State.

      In no way does a VOC Directive invalidate, reverse, alter or
      cancel any prior moves or transfers, even unrecorded or
      overlooked ones.  Nor does a VOC Directive change the legality
      or illegality of any prior move.  A VOC Directive only adjusts
      the actual Game State to conform to that perceived by the
      Players and Officers in Official Documentation.

      After a Document is subject to the adoption of a VOC Directive,
      the Player in charge of maintaining that Document shall annotate
      all subsequent publications of that Document with the date of
      the last such publication that was subject to the adoption of a
      VOC Directive.  i.e. the date the subject Document was published
      in the Public Forum, not the date the VOC Directive was Adopted.

Rule Changes
d1998 8
a2005 40
      There are two types of Rule Change. A Proposed Rule Change is a
      Rule Change which appears in a Proposal, and which, insofar as
      the Rules permit it to take effect, has the effect of Creating,
      Amending, Mutating, Repealing or otherwise changing a Rule as
      defined elsewhere in the Rules, directly as a result of the
      passage of a Proposal. A non-Proposed Rule Change has the same
      effect as a Proposed Rule Change, but insofar as the Rules
      permit it to take effect, it does so not as the direct result
      of the passage of a Proposal, but rather, indirectly, as the
      result of the effect or action of a Rule.

      All Rule Changes, of either type, are subject to the following
      constraints:

      An individual Rule Change must change exactly one Rule.

      Any Rule Change which affects an existing Rule must clearly and
      unambiguously identify the Rule to be affected.

      Any Rule Change which creates a New Rule may specify the
      Mutability Index of the New Rule; however, if the Mutability
      Index is specified it must be greater than or equal to 1.  If
      the Mutability Index of any Rule created by a Rule Change is not
      specified, it shall be 1.

      Any Rule Change which changes the Mutability Index of a Rule
      must clearly specify the new value of the Rule's Mutability
      Index.

      Any Rule Change which changes the text of a Rule must clearly
      and unambiguously specify the changes which are to be made. If
      the Rule Change quotes old text which is to be replaced with new
      text, then the quoted old text must match exactly with actual
      text in the Rule, with the exception of whitespace and
      capitalization. This takes precedence over Rules which would
      permit such differences, even if the differences would be
      considered inconsequential by such Rules.

      Any Rule Change which does not meet these criteria shall not
      have any legal force.

      Unless another Rule states otherwise, the Adoption Index of a
      Proposal shall be the minimum Adoption Index which would allow
      all Rule Changes and Directives within the Proposal to take
      effect, or 1, whichever is greater.

Rule 993/3 (Mutable, MI=1)
Directives

      A Proposal is permitted to contain one or more Directives.  A
      Directive, if it takes effect, causes some change in the Game
      State other than Changing a Rule.  No Directive shall Change
      any Rule.

      A Directive takes effect if and only if: (i) the Proposal
      containing it is adopted; (ii) the Directive is of a type
      specifically defined by the Rules; and, (iii) the Adoption Index
      of the Proposal is at least the minimum Adoption Index necessary
      for such a Directive to take effect.

      Unless another Rule states otherwise, the minimum Adoption Index
      necessary for a Directive to take effect is 1.

      If a Proposal containing Directives which take effect is
      adopted, those Directives shall take effect in the order that
      they appear in the Proposal, and according to the Rule or Rules
      which define the type of each Directive in question.

[CFJ 762: If a "Directive" is not defined by the Rules, it is not
 a Directive, but is still part of the Proposal.  (This may or may
 not apply after the adoption of Proposal 2399.)
 CFJ 778: It is legal for a Proposal to contain zero Directives.]

      As long as a Proposal satisfies all requirements in place at the
      time of its making for the proper making of Proposals, the act
      of making such a Proposal is legal regardless of its content.
      It is legal to propose a Rule Change which cannot be applied,
      or which, if adopted, would result in there being Rules which
      conflict with other Rules or with themselves, which are
      paradoxical, or which cannot be applied.

      A Proposal is Disinterested if the text of the message wherein
      it is submitted explicitly states that it is a Disinterested
      Proposal.  Whenever a Disinterested Proposal is distributed, it
      must be clearly marked as such.

      Whatever the outcome of voting on a Disinterested Proposal, no
      transfer of Currencies, Blots, or any other class of Entities
      which might occur solely as a result of the proto-proposing of,
      voting upon or adoption of such a Proposal, shall legally take
      place; unless the Rule which requires the transfer explicitly
      states that the transfer applies to a Disinterested Proposal.

      In addition, no changes in Style shall result from Disinterested
      Proposals. Any penalties resulting from the act of submitting a
      Proposal, such as for excess Proposals, remain applicable.

      All Amendments within a Disinterested Proposal shall be
      Unattributed.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule seeking to effect
      transfers prohibited by this Rule.

      is currently the Assessor or has been the Assessor at any time
      after that Proposal's distribution.

      When a Proposal is disowned, five Mil are transferred from
      its Proposer to the Bank; this transfer is to be reported by the
      Assessor.  All other transfers of Currencies or Blot Changes
      occuring as a result of the submission of, voting upon, or

      The effect of the adoption of a Proposal shall be limited to the

      which are contained within the Proposal and which can be clearly
      identified as such.

      CFJ alleging that the Infraction did not occur.  If this CFJ is
      found TRUE, then the penalties are reversed, to the extent
      possible, 72 hours from the time of Judgement.  If the CFJ is
      appealed before this time, this reversal is deferred until
      immediately after the appeal is resolved.

      If an appeal finds that the Infraction did not occur, and the
      penalty has not been reversed, the penalty is reversed to the
      extent possible immediately upon resolution of the appeal.

      If an appeal finds that the Infraction did occur, then the
      penalty shall not be reversed.  If the penalty has been
      reversed, the penalty is immediately re-applied upon resolution
      of the appeal.

      Detecting and reporting the consequences of penalty reversals
      and re-applications due to this Rule shall be the duty of the
      Clerk of the Courts.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule that would require

      Patent Title must have an Adoption Index of at least 1.

      known to all Players by that Patent Title. If the Directive
      fails, that person may not be nominated for the same Patent
      Title for a period of 4 weeks.

      A Treasury is a repository for holding Currencies.  A Treasury
      is permitted to contain any quantity of Currencies in any
      combination, unless otherwise restricted by some other Rule.

      Every unit of every Currency always resides in some Treasury.
      Units of Currency shall only be placed into, removed from, or
      transferred between, Treasuries as permitted by the Rules.

      The possession of Treasuries is limited to those entities
      authorized by the Rules to possess them.  No entity shall
      possess more than one Treasury; no Treasury shall be possessed
      by more than one entity.  Treasuries shall not be transferred.

      It shall always be a permissible and unambiguous abbreviation to
      state that an entity in possession of a Treasury possesses the
      Currencies within that Treasury.

      When a Treasury is created, it contains no units of any
      Currency.

      When a Treasury is destroyed, all units of Currency within it
      are transferred to the Treasuries of the Mintors of the
      respective Currencies, to the extent permitted by the Rules.
      Any untransferrable Currencies are instead destroyed.

      The Recordkeepors of each individual Currency are required to
      detect and report transfers of that Currency which occur as a
      result of this Rule.

      Executor of that Entity.  The Executor of a non-Player Nomic
      Entity shall have the legal authority to act on behalf of that
      Entity, as if e were that Entity.  The Rules may also specify
      constraints on how the Executor of an Entity may act.

      If a non-Player Nomic Entity has no Executor, it may not act
      except as specifically required of it by the Rules.

      The Executor of a Group is that Group's Vizier.

      For the sake of completeness, a Player is eir own Executor.

      Whenever a Player is acting on behalf of some Entity of which e
      is the Executor, e must make it clear that e is doing so.  If
      such a Player fails to clearly indicate that e is acting as the
      Executor of some other Entity, it shall be presumed that e is
      acting on eir own behalf.

Currency Transfers, generally
d5807 31
a5837 23
      The Rules have the power to require the transfer of Currencies;
      no other Entity also has this power unless explicitly granted it
      by the Rules, and then only to the extent granted by the Rules.

      No Entity other than the Rules themselves has the power to
      require any transfer which would result in the Treasury being
      transferred from containing a negative quantity of the Currency
      transferred.

      Whenever an Entity requires a transfer of Currencies to take
      place, the transfer takes place as required, provided that the
      Entity which is requiring the transfer is permitted by the Rules
      to require that transfer, and provided that the transfer is
      otherwise permitted by the Rules.

      Such a transfer takes place at the time specified by the Entity
      which requires the transfer, or, if no time is specified, at the
      time when the Entity first begins to require the transfer.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would permit or
      require a transfer prohibited by this Rule.  When another Rule
      would prohibit some transfer permitted by this Rule, this Rule
      defers to that Rule with respect to that transfer.

      a) the Player requiring the transfer is the Executor of the

         reports it.

      known as the current Limbo Period for that amount of
      Currency.  Initially, no Currency is in Limbo.

      The Recordkeepor for a Currency shall keep records of all
      amounts of that Currency currently in Limbo, which Treasury
      each is in, and when the Limbo Period of each ends.

      These records are private, and during the Limbo Period, a
      Recordkeepor is prohibited from revealing any part of these
      records which e would not have knowledge of were e not the
      Recordkeepor for that Currency.  Doing so is a Class C
      Crime.
d5998 4

      Unless another Rule specifies otherwise, whenever the Limbo
      period of an amount of Currency ends, that amount is no

Rule 1608/2 (Mutable, MI=1)
The Mil
d6182 1
a6182 42
      A Mil is a variable quantity of Marks. The 'ideal value' of the
      Mil is equal to one thousandth of all the Marks in existence
      which were not held by the Bank at the beginning of the month.
      However, negative quantities of Marks do not exist for the
      purposes of this Rule. The 'posted value' of the Mil is the
      value of the Mil last posted by the Banker. The 'actual value'
      or 'legal value' of the Mil is the value of the Mil used for
      the purposes of calculating the sizes of various transfers made
      in Mil, and it is always equal to the last posted value of the
      Mil to become the actual value. A posted value of the Mil only
      becomes the actual value as specified in this Rule.

      As soon as possible after the beginning of the month, the
      Banker shall calculate the ideal value of the Mil and post the
      result of eir calculation to the Public Forum. If the Banker's
      calculation of the ideal value of the Mil remains unchalleged by
      COE or CFJ for 72 hours after it is published, then the posted
      value of the Mil becomes the actual value, as of the end of the
      72 hour period.

      If the posted value of the Mil is challenged by COE or CFJ
      within 72 hours of its publication, then the actual value of
      the Mil shall then be determined according to the following
      provisions:

      If it is determined as a result of the COE or CFJ that the
      posted value of the Mil differs from the ideal value by less
      than or equal to 5% of the ideal value, then the posted value
      of the Mil becomes the actual value.

      If it is determined as a result of the COE or CFJ that the
      posted value of the Mil differs from the ideal value by greater
      than 5% of the ideal value, the Banker shall, within 72 hours,
      recalculate the ideal value of the Mil and post the result of
      eir calculation to the Public Forum. This new posted value is
      subject to all the conditions set out in this Rule for a posted
      value of the Mil to become the actual value.

Definition of the Powers
d6325 2
a6326 4
      There is a class of Nomic Entities called the Powers. An Entity
      is a Power if and only if it designated by the Rules to be so.
      Powers are a Currency. The Mintor of the Powers is the Mint.
      The Recordkeepor for the Powers is the Assessor.
d6328 4
a6331 4
      Instances of Powers are called Cards.  A Player uses a Power by
      'casting' it as provided by the Rule defining that Power. A
      Player may cast a Power only if e possesses a Card of that
      Power.
d6333 1
a6333 43
      Powers may only be cast by Active Players. A Player must inform
      the Assessor whenever e casts a Power, otherwise the Power is
      not legally cast.

      The casting Player is called the Caster. Rules which create
      specific Powers may specify that that Power may not be cast or
      may only be cast by certain Players, or on certain Players.

      If the casting of a Power requires the specification by the
      Caster of a Proposal or Proposals to which it applies, then all
      Proposals so specified by the Caster must be ones for which the
      Voting Period has commenced and not yet concluded, or the Power
      is not legally cast. If a Card of such a Power is legally
      cast, it is In Limbo until the Voting Periods of all specified
      Proposals have ended.

      The following are generally true of all Cards, unless a Rule
      defining a specific Power says otherwise of the Power which
      that Rule defines:

      1) exactly one Card of a given type exists at any time.
      2) when a Card is not held by any Player, it is held by
         the Bank.
      3) provided that the Bank holds at least one Card of a
         given type, Players may purchase a Card of that type
         from the Bank.
      4) the purchase price of a Card is 10 Mil.
      5) If a Player does not use a Card within a week of having
         acquired it, either from the Bank or from another Player,
         it is returned to the Bank.
      6) a Player who possesses a Card but who has not yet made
         use of it may trade it to another Player as e sees fit.
      7) Cards which are In Limbo may not be cast.

      The Assessor is responsible for detecting and reporting all
      transfers which occur as a result of the use of Powers.

      No Player may possess more than two Cards in any ten day
      period. This restriction is called 'the ten day restriction'.
      For the purposes of this Rule, each acquisition of a Card by a
      Player counts as a new possession of a Card by that Player.  If
      the transfer of a Card to Player would result in that Player
      violating the ten day restriction, then the transfer is
      cancelled and does not take place. This Rule takes precedence
      over any Rule which requires or permits transfers prohibited by
      this Rule from taking place.

      A Player purchases a Card from the Bank by sending a message to
      the Public Forum indicating that e transfers the purchase price
      of that Card to the Bank, and indicating which Card it is that
      e wishes to purchase, provided that the purchase does not
      violate the ten day restriction.

      A Player trades a Card to another Player by sending a message

The Powers Lottery
d6382 20
a6401 17
      As soon as possible after the beginning of each Nomic Week in
      which at least one Card of a Power is held by the Bank, the
      Assessor shall conduct a Powers Lottery, as set out below, and
      announce the results of the Lottery in the Public Forum.

      The Powers Lottery is conducted as follows: the Assessor
      randomly chooses one Card which is held by the Bank to be the
      prize of that week's Lottery. The Assessor also randomly
      chooses an Active Player to be winner of the week's Lottery.
      The chosen Card is transferred to the winner of the week's
      Lottery.

      If the Card chosen to be the prize is a Card of the Power of
      Influence, then the Card counts as a 3-vote Power of Influence
      Card. This Rule takes precedence over Rules which describe
      other ways of determining the influence granted by a Card of
      the Power of Influence.

The Power of Immunity
d6417 20
a6436 39
      There is a Power called the Power of Immunity. There are 4
      Immunity Cards. A Player who possesses an Immunity Card may
      only cast the Power on emself. A Player upon whom the Power
      of Immunity is cast is called an Immune Player.  A Card of the
      Power of Immunity is in Limbo for ten days after it is cast.

      The effect of the Power of Immunity is to neutralize the
      effects of Powers upon the Immune Player, other than those
      Powers cast by the Immune Player emself, for a period
      commencing three days prior to the casting of the Power, and
      concluding ten days after the Power is cast. A Power which is
      neutralized in this way is called a Neutralized Power. The
      Power of Immunity does not cancel the castings of Neutralized
      Powers upon an Immune Player; rather, it deprives them of any
      effects on an Immune Player which they might otherwise have.

      The purchase price of a Power which is Neutralized because a
      Player is Immune is transferred from the Bank to the Caster of
      the Neutralized Power. For a Neutralized Power which has been
      cast prior to the casting of the Power of Immunity, this
      transfer takes place when the Power of Immunity is cast. For a
      Neutralized Power which is cast after the Power of Immunity is
      cast, this transfer takes place at the time the Neutralized
      Power is cast. The Assessor is responsible for detecting these
      transfers and reporting them to the appropriate Recordkeepor.

      This Rule takes precedence over all other Rules which define
      specific Powers.

      If this Rule conflicts in its effects with those of another
      Rule defining a specific Power, then the conflict shall be
      resolved according to the Rule for determining precedence
      among Powers.

Rule 1521/5 (Mutable, MI=1)
The Oracle Power
a6443 43
      There is a Power called the Oracle Power. There are two Oracle
      Cards. The Player upon whom the Oracle Power is cast is called
      the Oracle. The Oracle Power may not be cast by or on the
      Assessor.

      When a Player is the Oracle, e must predict whether a
      particular Proposal, specified by the Caster, will pass or
      fail. This prediction must be made in a message to the Public
      Forum, before the end of the Voting Period on that Proposal.
      The Oracle may predict at most one of the outcomes, pass or
      fail. If the Oracle predicts the outcome of the vote on that
      Proposal correctly, then 10 Mil and one Extra Vote are
      transferred from the Caster to the Bank, and from the Bank to
      the Oracle. If the prediction of the Oracle is incorrect, or if
      the Oracle makes no prediction before the close of the Voting
      Period, then 3 Extra Votes are transferred from the Oracle to
      the Caster, and 50 Mil are transferred from the Oracle to the
      Bank, and from the Bank to the Caster.

      The Caster casts the Oracle Power upon a Player by sending a
      message to the Public Forum specifying that that Player is to
      be the Oracle. In the same message, the Caster must also state
      on which Proposal the Oracle is to make eir prediction. This
      Proposal must be one for which the first half of the Voting
      Period has not yet finished, at the time the message appears in
      the Public Forum. Unless all these conditions are met, the
      Power is not legally cast.

      If this Rule conflicts in its effects with those of another
      Rule defining a specific Power, then the conflict shall be
      resolved according to the Rule for determining precedence
      among Powers.

      The Assessor is responsible for detecting and reporting all
      transfers which occur as a result of this Rule.

The Power of Influence

a6460 31
      There is a Power called the Power of Influence. A Player on
      whom the Power of Influence is cast is called an Influential
      Player. The effect of the Power of Influence is to increase
      the maximum number of votes which the Influential Player may
      cast on a single Proposal, specified by the Caster, called the
      Influenced Proposal. The maximum number of votes which may be
      cast by the Influential Player on the Influenced Proposal may
      be increased to 3, 4, or 5 votes, depending on the price last
      paid to the Bank in order to purchase the Power. The purchase
      price of the Power of Influence increases according to the
      extent of the Influence granted by the use of the Power, and
      this greater influence is granted by the Power of Influence
      only if the Bank is paid for it, as set out below:

      A maximum of 3 votes :  10 Mil
      A maximum of 4 votes :  25 Mil
      A maximum of 5 votes :  50 Mil

      A Player casts the Power of Influence by sending a message to
      the Assessor specifying which player is to be the Influential
      Player, and which Proposal is to be the Influential Proposal.

      If this Rule conflicts in its effects with those of another

The Power of Quiet
d6501 14
a6514 36
      There is Power called the Power of Quiet. There are 3 Quiet
      Cards. The purchase price for each of these Cards is 5 Mil.
      The effect of this Power is to prevent the Player on whom it is
      cast, called the Quiet Player, from casting any Extra Votes on
      a Proposal specified by the Caster, called the Quiet Proposal.
      The Power of Quiet may not be cast by the Assessor.

      A Quiet Player is not permitted to cast Extra Votes on their
      Quiet Proposal. If a Quiet Player has already cast Extra
      Votes on their Quiet Proposal at the time they become Quiet,
      then those Extra Votes are without effect on the Quiet
      Proposal, and their Limbo Period ends immediately without
      their being transferred to the Bank.

      The Caster casts the Power of Quiet by sending a message to the
      Assessor unambiguously identifying the Player who is to be
      the Quiet Player, and the Proposal which is to be the Quiet
      Proposal. Unless this condition is met, the Power is not
      legally cast.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which describe the
      circumstances in which Players may legally cast Extra Votes,
      with the exception of Rules which describe the effects of other
      Powers. This Rule also takes precedence over other Rules which
      describe the effects of legally cast Extra Votes on Proposals.

      If this Rule conflicts in its effects with those of another
      Rule defining a specific Power, then the conflict shall be
      resolved according to the Rule for determining precedence
      among Powers.

The Skeptic Power
d6523 6
a6528 43
      There is a Power called the Skeptic Power. There are two
      Skeptic Cards. The Caster of the Skeptic Power is called the
      Skeptic; the Player on whom the Skeptic Power is cast is called
      the Believer. The Skeptic Power may not be cast by or on the
      Assessor.

      A Player casts the Skeptic Power by sending a message to the
      Public Forum clearly and unambiguously identifying the Player
      who is to be the Believer. In the same message, the Skeptic
      must give the number of a Proposal, called the Doubtful
      Proposal, which has been proposed by the Believer, for which
      the first half of the Voting Period has not yet finished, and
      state that e, the Skeptic, doubts that this Proposal will pass.
      Unless all these conditions are met, the Power is not legally
      cast.

      The Believer must, before the conclusion of the Voting Period
      of the Doubtful Proposal, indicate in a message to the Public
      Forum, whether e concurs with or dissents from the doubt of the
      Skeptic. If e makes no such indication, then e is assumed to
      have dissented.

      If the Believer indicates that e concurs with the doubt of the
      Skeptic, then the Believer is penalized 30 Mil, which are
      transferred to the Bank, and from the Bank to the Skeptic.

      If the Believer dissents from the doubt of the Skeptic, then if
      the Doubtful Proposal fails, the Believer is penalized 3 Extra
      Votes, which are transferred from the Believer to the Skeptic,
      and 50 Mil, which are transferred from the Believer to the
      Bank, and from the Bank to the Skeptic. If, however, the
      Doubtful Proposal passes, then the Skeptic is penalized 3 Extra
      Votes, which are transferred from the Skeptic to the Believer,
      and 20 Mil, which are transferred from the Skeptic to the
      Bank, and from the Bank to the Believer.

      If this Rule conflicts in its effects with those of another
      Rule defining a specific Power, then the conflict shall be
      resolved according to the Rule for determining precedence
      among Powers.

      The Assessor is responsible for detecting and reporting all
      Currency transfers which occur as a result of this Rule.

The Power of Democracy
d6546 3
a6548 50
      There is a Power called the Power of Democracy. It can be cast
      on any one Proposal, specified by the Caster, and called the
      Democratic Proposal. The effect of the Power of Democracy is to
      limit the Votes cast on the Democratic Proposal.

      The Card of the Power of Democracy is in Limbo for ten days
      after it is cast. The price of the Democracy Card is 30 Mil.

      The Caster can only cast the Power of Democracy by sending a
      message to the Assessor unambiguously identifying the Proposal
      which is to be the Democratic Proposal, otherwise the Power is
      not legally cast.

      The Votes cast on a Democratic Proposal are limited in the
      following manner:  The Assessor shall only record one Vote from
      each non-Immune Active Player who chooses to Vote.  Extra Votes
      cast by any Entity other than an Immune Player, and Votes from
      non-Player entities are not counted in determining the results
      of a Vote on a Democratic Proposal.

      If an entity other than an Immune Player has already cast Extra
      Votes on the Democratic Proposal at the time it became
      Democratic, then these Extra Votes are without effect on the
      Democratic Proposal, and their Limbo Period ends immediately
      without their being transferred to the Bank.

      Players who are Immune are not bound by the limitations set by
      this Rule as long as any Extra Votes they cast were done so
      during the duration of their Immunity.

      If the casting of this Power conflicts with the casting of any
      Power other than the Powers of Immunity and Neutralize, the
      Power of Democracy takes precedence, the other Power is
      nullified and has no effect.  If another Power is nullified
      because of the precedence of the Democracy Card, the cost of the
      nullified Power is transferred to the Player who cast it.  This
      transfer occurs at the end of the Voting Period for the
      Democratic Proposal. The Assessor is responsible for detecting
      and reporting these transfers.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which describe the
      circumstances in which Players may legally cast Extra Votes,
      over Rules which describe the effects of legally cast Extra
      Votes on Proposals, and over Rules describing what Entities are
      permitted to cast Votes on Proposals in general.

      If this Rule conflicts in its effects with those of another
      Rule defining a specific Power, then the conflict shall be
      resolved according to the Rule for determining precedence
      among Powers.

Wizard Transition
d6635 8
a6642 36
      Wizard Transition is the process by which one Player ceases to
      be Wizard while, at the same time, another Player becomes the
      Wizard.  Wizard Transition occurs when any of the following
      happens:

         i) A new quarter has begun.
        ii) The Wizard goes (or is already) On Hold
       iii) The Wizard no longer wishes to be Wizard.

      The Wizard must initiate a Wizard Transition as soon as possible
      after any of these events by announcing the initiation in the
      Public Forum stating that a Wizard Transition is taking Place.

      The announcement must contain a Transition List containing the
      names of all Players who are not On Hold and not the Wizard, in
      descending order of their Style.

      If the Transition is occurring as a result of the beginning of a
      new quarter, the Style used for this ordering is the Style the
      Players had immediately prior to the beginning of that quarter.
      Otherwise, it is the Players' current Style.

      In the case of Players with the same Style, those Players' order
      is randomly determined by the Wizard. (As long as the list as a
      whole is ordered by descending Style.)

      Upon the announcement of the Transition, the first Player on the
      Transition List (The Player with the highest Style) immediately
      becomes the Wizard, and the Player who initiated the Transition
      ceases to be the Wizard.

      If a Player ever ceases to be Wizard before initiating a Wizard
      Transition, or if there is, for any reason, no Player legally
      designated as the Wizard, the Speaker shall immediately become
      the Wizard and, as soon as possible thereafter, initiate a
      Wizard Transition.

d6664 3
a6666 12
      The new Wizard has the option of declining within 72 hours after
      becoming the Wizard by posting a message to the Public Forum
      saying e doesn't wish to be Wizard.  If this decline is made,
      that Player's name is stricken from the Transition list (as if
      eir name never appeared upon it), and that Player ceases to be
      the Wizard.  The next Player in descending order immediately
      becomes the first Player on the Transition list and becomes
      Wizard, with the same option of declining.

      A decline may also be done before a Player becomes Wizard, and
      any Player who does so has eir name stricken from the Transition
      list as if eir name had never appeared upon it.

            are not already Immaculate. Any change in Blots which
            occurs as a result of this Rule is detected and reported
            by the Tabulator;

      (ii)  Chuck and Steve both win the game, with Chuck becoming
            Speaker-Elect.  This Rule takes precedence over any Rule
            which would make a Player other than Chuck the
            Speaker-Elect upon his winning the game.

      (iii) Every Player, with the exception of Chuck and Steve, who
            cast exactly one vote FOR and no votes AGAINST the
            Proposal, proposed by Steve, the adoption of which
            resulted in the creation of the Rule entitled "A Win by
            Indirect Self-Reference II" receives 3 Extra Votes from
            the Bank.

      (iv)  Every Player, with the exception of Chuck and Steve, who
            cast exactly two votes FOR and no votes AGAINST the
            Proposal, proposed by Steve, the adoption of which
            resulted in the Creation of the Rule entitled "A Win by
            Indirect Self-Reference II" receives 5 Extra Votes from
            the Bank.

      All transfers of Extra Votes which occur as a result of this
      Rule are detected and reported by the Assessor.

Wills

      A Player's Will is an SLC, the Jurisdiction of which irrevocably
      consists of that Player. The Notary shall be the Maintainer of
      all such SLCs.

      Such an SLC shall only contain provisions specifying how
      the contents of that Player's Treasury shall be disposed of in
      the event of that Player's deregistering. Such an SLC is
      empowered to initiate all such transfers, as long as they are
      permitted by the Rules.

      These transfers shall occur immediately before that Player
      deregisters; however, any transfers required by the dissolution
      or destruction of another Entity of which that Player is the
      Executor shall occur before these.

      All transfers required by a Will shall be detected and reported
      by the Notary.

      A Will is created by sending to the Notary a collection of text
      clearly labeled as a Will, which shall then become that Player's
      Will if that Player didn't have a Will before. A Player can
      modify eir Will by sending a new version to the Notary, and only
      in this manner.

      its SLC specifies a manner in which this division is to take

Rule 1491/2 (Mutable, MI=1)
Win Tokens and the Tabulator

      Win Tokens are a Currency.  The Recordkeepor of Win Tokens is
      the Tabulator; the Mintor of Win Tokens is the Mint.

      The Tabulator shall, at least once per Nomic Week, post a report
      detailing the number of Win Tokens held in each Treasury and all
      transactions involving Win Tokens which have occured since the
      last report.

      existence are destroyed.

Rule 1492/3 (Mutable, MI=1)
Winning by Tokens

      A Player Wins when e is both not on Hold and possesses a number
      of Win Tokens which exceeds the number held by every other
      Player at that time by the number of registered Players at the
      time the current month began.  No Player already holding a Noble
      or higher Cup may Win in this manner.

      The Tabulator shall notify the Public Forum as soon as possible
      after a Player Wins by the application of this Rule.

      The Tabulator shall include in eir Report the number of Tokens

Win Token Transfers
a6342 4
      Each Player is permitted to make up to 3 Win Token Transactions,
      of the sorts described in this Rule, per Nomic Week.  A Currency
      Transfer, as defined elsewhere, which involves Win Tokens is
      not a Win Token Transaction.
a6343 64
      The legal Win Token Transactions are:

      * The creation of one Win Token, which is then placed in the
        Treasury of any Player other than the Player making the
        Transaction; and

      * The removal of one Win Token from the Treasury of any Player;
        this Win Token is then destroyed.

      A Player who wishes to make a Win Token Transaction shall do so
      by notifying the Tabulator of the Transaction.

      loses a number of Mil equal to eir Win Tokens, which shall be
      reported by the Tabulator no later than the time e publishes eir

      Upon the distribution of a legal judgement to the Nomic
      community, a Concurring or a Dissenting Opinion may be filed in
      written format with the Clerk of the Courts.  The Concurring or
      Dissenting Opinion must satisfy the following criteria:

       (i) The opinion must be accompanied by reasons and arguments,
           which include, but are not necessarily limited to,
           citations of deciding Rules, past Judgement, and Agora
           Conventions.

             (ii) The opinion must be sponsored by at least two active
           Agora players and the sponsors must be listed on the
           opinion.

            (iii) The opinion must be filed with the Clerk of the
           Courts within 1 Nomic Week.

             (iv) The opinion must be entitled Concurring or
           Dissenting with the Judgement.

      Once an opinion satisfies these components, the Clerk of the
      Courts must distribute the opinion to all Players as soon
      as possible.  Furthermore, all Concurring and Dissenting
      Opinions must be appended to the Legal Judgement as Concurring
      or Dissenting Opinions.

      This Rule defers to all other Rules which do not contain this
      sentence.

d4211 19
a4229 21
      The mandated weekly posting of the Ruleset shall be done in the
      "Logical Rule Set Format". In this format, each Rule is assigned
      to a principal Category, and the Rules are grouped according to
      their Category. Within a Category, the ordering of Rules is
      decided by the Rulekeepor. All existing Rule Categories must be
      listed, along with a brief description, whether or not any Rules
      currently are assigned to the Category.

      Whenever a new Rule is added, it is assigned to the most
      appropriate Category in the opinion of the Rulekeepor, who must
      choose from existing Categories. Alternatively, the Rulekeepor
      may create a new Rule Category and assign the Rule to this new
      Category, if this is permitted by other Rules. Once e assigns a
      Rule to a Category, e may not change it except as provided by
      other Rules.

      However, if the Proposal itself stipulates a specific Category,
      as provided for by other Rules, the Rulekeepor is required to
      abide by this, if it is a valid defined Category. Also, a Rule's
      Category may be changed by a type of Proposal defined in other
      Rules.
d4236 3
a4274 24
Rule 1452/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Rulekeepor Maintains Categories

      The Rulekeepor is given the authority to define a new Rule
      Category in the following specific situation: If the Category is
      not specified in a Proposal to Create a Rule, AND in the
      Rulekeepor's estimation none of the existing Rule Categories is
      appropriate, then the Rulekeepor may unilaterally define and
      create a new Category and assign the new Rule to this Category.

      The Rulekeepor must announce the creation of the new Category to
      the Public Forum no later than the publication of the first Rule
      Set which uses the new Category. The announcement may be in the
      same message as the Rule Set itself.

      An empty Rule Category may be removed by the Rulekeepor as e
      sees fit.

      by the Rulekeepor along with the Rule. However, they are not
      part of the Rule itself and have no effect on the application of
      the Rule, being merely a convenience for the Players. Titles,
      once assigned, may not be altered except as specified in this
      and other Rules.

      For a new Rule created as a result of a Rule Change Proposal:

      If the Rule Change Proposal specifies the Title within the body
      of the Proposal, that Title is assigned. Otherwise the
      Rulekeepor chooses a Title.

      For a new Rule created by other means:

      If the procedure which caused the Rule to be created specifies
      a way to determine the Title, then that Title is assigned.
      Otherwise, the Rulekeepor chooses a Title.
a4310 6
      Titles for old Rules with no Titles:

      If a Rule has no Title, because it was created at a time when

      class of Organization, all Organizations of that class are

      in its Compact, with the unanimous consent of all the Players

      When any Player within the Jurisdiction of a Compact believes
      the Compact to have been Violated by another Player, e shall
      inform the Administrator of that Compact's Organization of that
      belief, along with the nature of the Violation, the Violated
      text of the Compact, and the identity of the Violating Player.
      The Administrator shall then, As Soon As Possible, distribute
      this information to all Players within the Jurisdiction of the
      Violated Compact.

      If, within seven days of this distribution, no Player within the
      Compact's Jurisdiction disputes the claim, the Administrator
      shall declare the Compact Violated.  The Administrator is then
      allowed to initiate any corrections and penalties allowed by the
      Rules and eir Organization's Compact.

      If, however, any Player under the Compact's Jurisdiction
      disputes the claim of Violation within seven days, then any
      Player within the Compact's Jurisdiction may submit a Call for
      Judgement, alleging that a specific Player has Violated the
      Compact. Such a Call for Judgement cannot be made in any other
      circumstance.

      All Players within the Compact's Jurisdiction are automatically
      ineligible to Judge such a CFJ.

      In the event that such a CFJ is found TRUE, the Compact has
      been Violated and the Compact's Administrator shall perform the
      same duties as when no Player contests the claim.  In the event
      that such a CFJ is found FALSE, the Player which called the CFJ
      shall lose 1 Mil to the Bank; this transfer shall be detected
      and reported by the Administrator of the Compact's Organization,
      if the Organization does not possess a Treasury, by its Executor
      otherwise.

      This Rule defers to all other Rules which do not contain this
      sentence.

      Organization, in order to have effect upon Execution, must
      specify the proposed class, name, and Compact of the prospective
      Organization, along with any other information that is required
      in order to create an Organization of the class specified, and
      all of these specifications must not conflict with the Rules in
      any way; and the Application must bear the signatures of at
      least as many distinct Players as required by the Rules
      pertaining to the class of the Organization to be created, all
      of whom must be eligible to be members of the prospective

      which complies with the requirements of this and other Rules is
      to create the Organization named therein, with the Players who

      the Clerk; however, if the dismissal is subsequently set aside,
      then that CFJ is no longer dismissed and shall again be

        TRUE or FALSE;
      * The CFJ's Statement does not relate to a matter in which the
        Rules have bearing or concern;
      * The CFJ's Statement fails to comply with any other Rules
        pertaining to legal Statements in Calls for Judgement; or
      * The CFJ lacks standing, as defined elsewhere.

      In addition, the Judge is permitted to dismiss the CFJ if e
      lacks sufficient information to make a determination of TRUE or
      FALSE.  The Judge is required to make a reasonable effort to
      obtain all information necessary to make a decision before
      dismissing a CFJ for this reason.

      No CFJ shall be dismissed for any reason other than those
      specified in this or other Rules.

      If a CFJ is dismissed for a given reason, but upon Appeal that
      dismissal is set aside, then that CFJ shall not again be
      dismissed for that same reason.  A Judge who does so commits an
      Infraction, the penalty for which is 3 Blots, to be reported by
      the Clerk of the Courts.

      Judges shall, in certain situations when specifically authorized
      by the Rules, have the power to issue orders requiring one or
      more Players to perform (or refrain from performing) one or more
      Actions.  Such an order is called an Injunction.

      An Injunction, in order to be legally made, must:

        * specify the Player or Players to whom it applies and the
          Action or Actions that Player or Players are required to
          perform (or refrain from performing).
        * accompany the Judgement of a Call for Judgement, of which
          the Player issuing the Injunction is the Judge; and
        * be an Injunction issued in a situation where the Rules
          specifically permit the Judge an Injunction to restrain a
          Player or Players in the manner specified.

      An Injunction which does not meet these criteria, or which has
      otherwise been issued in a manner which is not consistent with
      the Rules, has no legal effect.

      A Judge issues an Injunction by transmitting it to the Clerk of
      the Courts simultaneously with the Judgement it accompanies.

      An Injunction has legal force at the moment the Injunction is
      published to the Public Forum, unless one of the following
      occurs within 72 hours of this publication:

        1) An appeal of the Judgement the Injunction accompanies is
           initiated; or
        2) An appeal challenging the validity of the Injunction is
           initiated.

      If either of these occurs, the Injunction instead takes legal
      effect upon the publication of the decision(s) of the Board(s)
      of Appeals which hears the appeal(s), and then only if the
      Board(s) sustains all matters which are appealed with respect to
      that CFJ.

      If either of the above occurs but not within 72 hours of the
      publication of the Injunction, the Injunction remains in force
      during the Appeal(s).

      If a Judgement which is accompanied by an Injunction is appealed
      and the Judgement is overturned upon Appeal, then the Injunction
      is set aside as of the time of the publication of the
      determination of the Appeals Board.

      to annotate the Rule in question with the Statement in the CFJ
      and the list of relevant Rules.

      The annotation shall remain only until one of the Rules in the
      list of relevant Rules is changed in any way; or until a CFJ
      determines that the injunction no longer applies, as described
      below.  While it remains, it shall guide the application of that
      Rule.

      If a Player believes that the circumstances which led to the
      Judgement no longer prevail and the annotation is therefore no

Appeals

      Whenever an Appeal is initiated, a Board of Appeals shall be
      constituted to consider the Appeal and to reach a determination.
d3352 30
a3381 30
      A Board of Appeals shall consist of three distinct Players,
      called Justices.  The Clerk of the Courts shall select the
      Justices for each Board of Appeals as follows, until three
      eligible Justices have been selected.  First, the Speaker shall
      be selected, if eligible.  Then, the Justiciar shall be
      selected, if eligible. Then, the Clerk of the Courts shall be
      selected, if eligible.  All remaining positions on the Board (if
      any) shall then be filled by the random selection of the Clerk
      of the Courts from amongst all those Players eligible to be
      selected, as described below.

      A Player who has already been selected to serve on a given Board
      of Appeal is not eligible to be selected a second time for that
      Board; this does not in any way affect that Player's eligibility
      to serve in the first position, however.

      If a Board of Appeals is considering a question pertaining to a
      CFJ, then a Player shall only be eligible to be selected to
      serve on that Board of Appeals if e was not a Judge of that CFJ,
      and is eligible to be selected as a Judge of that CFJ.  However,
      if this restriction would result in there being fewer than three
      Players who are eligible to serve on that Board of Appeals, it
      shall not have any effect for that Board.

      If a Board of Appeals is considering a question that does not
      pertain to any one CFJ, then all Active Players (except those
      already selected) shall be eligible to be selected for that
      Board.  If this would result in there being fewer than three
      Players who are eligible to serve on that Board of Appeals, then
      all Players, whether or not active, shall be eligible.

      The Judgement returned by a Judge shall be subject to review by
      the Board of Appeals.  Such an appeal shall be initiated upon
      the insistence of any three Players.  The matter of
      consideration of such an appeal is whether or not the Judgement
      is correct.  If the Board of Appeals determines that the
      Judgement was not correct, it shall then order one of the
      following:

        * that the Judgement be reversed, so that the CFJ becomes
          Judged according to the majority opinion of the Board of
          Appeals; or
        * that the Judgement be set aside, and further that the CFJ be
          dismissed; or
        * that the Judgement be set aside, and a new Judge selected to
          Judge it.

      If a majority of the Justices agree that the Judgement was in
      error, but cannot agree as to which of the above actions should
      be taken, the Judgement shall be set aside and a new Judge
      selected to Judge it.

      For the purpose of this Rule, insistence of a Player consists of
      that Player posting a message to the Public Forum stating that e
      insists.

      such an appeal is whether or not the dismissal was justified.
      If the Appeal determines that the dismissal was not justified,
      then the dismissal shall be set aside.  If this happens, the
      Judge who dismissed the CFJ forfeits eir judicial Salary.

      For the purpose of this Rule, insistence of a Player consists of

      the insistence of any three Players, or upon the insistence of
      any single Player who is named in the Injunction.  The matter of
      consideration of such an appeal is whether or not the Injunction
      has been made in accordance with the Rules.  If the Appeal
      determines that the Injunction was not made in accordance with
      the Rules, then the Injunction shall be set aside, and the Judge
      who made the Injunction shall be penalized for an Infraction to
      be reported by the Clerk of the Courts and bearing a penalty of
      both 1 Blot and 5 Mils.

      For the purpose of this Rule, insistence of a Player consists of

Crime: General Definition
d3617 1

      Whenever a Player performs an action which is designated by the
      Rules as a Crime, and further it has been determined by a CFJ
      that in fact that this action did take place and was in fact a
      Crime, then that Player shall be subject to the penalties for
      that Crime, as defined by the Rules.

      An action is a Crime only if there is a Rule which designates it
      to be a Crime.  The fact that an action is prohibited by the
      Rules is not sufficient to make it a Crime.  The designation of
      an action as a Crime does not in any way grant legal status to
      that action.

      A Rule which designates an action to be a Crime must also either
      specify an explicit penalty for committing that Crime, or
      designate that Crime to be one of several Classes of Crime
      defined elsewhere in the Rules.  If a Rule designates an action
      to be a Crime, but does not either specify an explicit penalty
      or specify a valid Class of Crime, then that Crime shall not
      have any associated penalty.

      All criminal penalties shall take effect 72 hours after the
      announcement of the Judge's Ruling in the CFJ which alleges the
      criminal act; however, if the CFJ is appealed prior to this
      time, then the penalty shall not be applied until immediately
      after the announcement of the ruling of the Appeals Court, and
      then only if the Judgement of the Appeals Court is also TRUE.

      If the CFJ is appealed, but not within 72 hours, and the Appeals
      Court judges differently than the Judge of the CFJ, then all
      penalties shall be reversed to the fullest extent possible at
      the time the Appeal Court's Judgement is announced.

      Responsibility for reporting all consequences of the application
      or reversal of a Criminal penalty falls unto the Clerk of the
      Courts.  This includes, but is not limited to, reporting any
      Blot Awards or Currency Transfers to the Tabulator or the
      appropriate Recordkeepors.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which requires another
      Player to report Score, Currency, or Blot changes which result
      from the commission of a Crime, or which causes Score, Currency,
      or Blots changes resulting from the commission of a Crime to
      take effect sooner than specified in this Rule.

Infractions: General Definition

      Whenever a Player performs an action which is designated by the
      Rules as a Infraction, that Player shall be subject to the
      penalties for that Infraction, as defined by the Rules.

      An action is a Infraction only if there is a Rule which
      designates it to be a Infraction.  The fact that an action is
      prohibited by the Rules is not sufficient to make it a
      Infraction.  The designation of an action as a Infraction
      neither grants nor denies legal status to that action.

      A Rule which designates an action to be a Infraction must
      specify an explicit penalty for committing that Infraction.  If
      a Rule designates an action to be a Infraction, but does not
      specify an explicit penalty, then that Infraction shall not have
      any associated penalty.

      A Rule which designates an action to be an Infraction must
      specify the Officer who is to detect and report that Infraction,
      and only that Officer and the Speaker are authorized to detect
      and report that Infraction.  A report of an Infraction by a
      Player other than the Officer mandated to report such
      Infractions or the Speaker has no legal effect.

Rule 1508/3 (Mutable, MI=1)
Application of Penalties for Infractions; Appeals Thereof

      All penalties for Infractions take effect at the time the first
      report of the Infraction is posted by the Player who reported
      it, provided that report was made by a Player who is legally
      authorized to make it.  The determination of the reporting
      Player is legally binding until and unless it is reversed by a
      Call for Judgement.

      Any second or subsequent report of an Infraction has no legal
      effect.

      A Player who disagrees with the determination that an action was
      an Infraction is permitted to submit a Call for Judgement
      alleging that the action was not an Infraction.

      If the Officer's determination is reversed by CFJ, then the
      penalties shall be reversed 72 hours after the Judgement is
      announced, unless the CFJ is itself appealed during this time,
      in which case the penalties are reversed immediately upon the
      announcement of the ruling of the Appeals Court, and then only
      if the Appeals Court sustains the original Judgement.  If the
      CFJ is appealed, but not within 72 hours, and the Appeals Court
      does not sustain the original Judgement, the penalties shall be
      reapplied upon the time the Appeal Courts' Judgement is
      announced.

      The responsibility for reporting all consequences of the
      application of a penalty falls unto the Player who makes the
      report of Infraction.  The responsibility for reporting all
      consequences of the reversal or reapplication of a penalty as a
      result of the appeals process falls unto the Clerk of the
      Courts.  This includes, but is not limited to, reporting any
      Blot Awards or Currency Transfers to the Tabulator or the
      appropriate Recordkeepors.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which requires another
      Player to report Score, Currency, or Blot changes which result
      from the commission of a Infraction, or which causes Score,
      Currency, or Blots changes resulting from the commission of a
      Infraction to take effect sooner than specified in this Rule.

Referndum to Install

      There shall be a class of legal Referenda known as Referenda
      to Install.  Such a Referendum, if it takes effect, has the
      effect of installing the named player in the stated position.

      Any Player is permitted to call such a Referendum at any
      time, by posting such to the Public Forum and meeting all
      other requirements listed in this Rule.

      A Referendum to Install must name exactly one Player to fill
      the stated position, and the position to be filled.  The
      position named in such a Referendum must be one of the
      following:
        * the position of Speaker
        * the Office of Promotor
        * the Office of Assessor
        * the Office of Clerk of the Courts
        * the Office of Registrar.

      For such a Referendum the default procedure for Referenda
      is modified as follows: the Vote Collector is the Player who
      called for the Referendum.  Every Player is a Voting Entity.
      The Adoption Ratio of a Referendum to Install is 2.  Quorum
      for such a Referendum is 30% of all Players.

      A Referendum to Install takes effect if and only if all of the
      following conditions are true:
        * the Referendum passes
        * all requirements for such a Referendum are met
        * the Player named in the Referendum has, during the
          Duration of Voting, posted eir consent to fill the
          position named in the Referendum.

      When a Referendum to Install takes effect, the Player named
      therein immediately fills the position named therein.  Any
      other Player holding that position simultaneously ceases to
      hold it.

Rule 1475/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Points

      Points are a Currency.  The MUQ of Points is 0.1.  The
      Recordkeepor for Points is the Scorekeepor.  The Mintor for
      Points is the Mint.

      The Scorekeepor shall post at least once every Nomic Week an
      Official Report to the Public Forum detailing the number of
      Points held in every Treasury, and the changes thereof since at
      least the last such report.

      All transfers involving Points shall be reported to the Public
      Forum.  This takes precedence over any Rule which might not
      require, or which might prohibit, the reporting of a transfer to
      the Public Forum.

Rule 1511/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Limitations on Point Ownership and Transfer

      A transfer of Points is legal only if the transfer is from the
      Bank and to a Player's Treasury, if it is from a Player's
      Treasury and to the Bank, or if the transfer is of the sort
      specifically required by this Rule.  All other transfers of
      Points are illegal.

      If, for any reason, an Treasury belonging to an entity which is
      neither the Mint nor a Player contains a non-zero number of
      Points, all the Points in that Treasury shall be immediately
      transferred to the Bank, and a commensurate number of Marks
      computed using the primary Mark Exchange Rate shall be
      transferred from the Bank to that Treasury.  Such transfers
      shall be detected and reported by the Scorekeepor.

      This Rule takes precedence over all other Rules which determine
      the legality of Currency transfers.

Misers

      Every Player is either a Miser or a non-Miser.  Every Player
      is a non-Miser at the time e Registers, and every Player
      becomes a non-Miser whenever a new Game begins.  A Player
      becomes a Miser by announcing to the Public Forum that e
      is doing so.  The Scorekeepor shall keep a record of which
      Players are Misers and shall publish this information in eir
      Weekly Report.

      Whenever a Miser's Treasury contains any Points, those
      Points are immediately, without any delay or intervening
      events, transferred to the Bank, and a commensurate
      number of Marks, computed using the primary Mark Exchange
      Rate, are transferred from the Bank to the Miser's
      Treasury.  It is the responsibility of the Scorekeepor
      to detect and report these transfers.

      An Entity which possesses Points in any of its Treasuries is

      removed (if the Entity possess more than one Treasury).

      When such a message is sent, if the Treasury specified is owned
      by the Entity requesting the exchange and contains at least as
      many Points as are to be converted, then that many Points are
      transferred from that Treasury to the Bank, and, simultaneously,
      a commensurate number of Marks computed using the primary Mark
      Exchange Rate are transferred from the Bank to that Treasury.

      All these transfers shall be detected and reported by the
      Scorekeepor, as soon as possible after they take place.

      When a Speaker or Speaker-Elect is to be filled according to the

      <all other Voters in descending point order>

a6475 39
      of Succession; if it does not, a Speaker or Speaker-Elect shall
      not be chosen according to that Rule, and this Rule takes
      precedence over such Rules.

      When the position of Speaker or Speaker-Elect is to be filled,
      the Arbiter of Succession shall, as soon as possible, announce
      that fact to the Public Forum in a Call for Volunteers.  All
      Voters who are willing to fill the position shall indicate such
      in a message to the Arbiter of Succession, within three days of
      the Call for Volunteers.  If there are no volunteers, the
      Arbiter of Succession shall make another Call for Volunteers.

      As soon as possible after the end of the three-day period, and
      within four days after the end of that three-day period, the
      Arbiter of Succession shall announce which Voter, of those who
      indicated a willingness to fill the position, is highest on the
      order of succession.  That Voter shall immediately
      become Speaker or Speaker-Elect, whichever position was to be
      filled.  If e becomes Speaker, the old Speaker shall become a
      Voter.

      The Arbitration Period is defined as the period in the Order
      of Succession starting with the Call for Volunteers and ending
      with:
        1) the announcement by the Arbiter of Succession of the new
           Speaker or Speaker-Elect;
        2) the filling of the position to be filled by another method;
        3) the time when it becomes no longer necessary to complete
           the Order of Succession, according to other Rules;
        4) or seven days after the Call for Volunteers is issued;
      whichever comes first.

      If the Arbitration Period ends without any of the first three
      criteria for the end of the Arbitration Period being fulfilled,
      then a new Order of Succession shall begin to fill the required
      position, with the first Voter to post eir willingness to the
      Public Forum as Arbiter of Succession, excluding any Voters
      who have already served as Arbiter of Succession for this
      particular requirement to fill the position.

      Voters may be Speaker-Elect; whenever a Rule specifies that the
      Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker, e shall cease to be
      Speaker-Elect.  Only one Voter may be Speaker-Elect at any one
      time.  A Voter may not become Speaker-Elect except as specified

Rule 1427/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Precedence of Speaker/Speaker-Elect Selection

      If a Rule requires that the position of Speaker or Speaker-Elect
      is to be filled during the Arbitration Period for filling the
      position of Speaker, then that requirement is negated; this
      Rule takes precedence over such Rules.

      If a Rule requires that the position of Speaker-Elect is
      to be filled during the Arbitration Period for filling the
      position of Speaker-Elect, then that requirement is negated;
      this Rule takes precedence over such Rules.

      If a Rule requires that the position of Speaker is to
      be filled during the Arbitration Period for filling the
      position of Speaker-Elect, then the Order of Succession
      procedure for Speaker-Elect is not completed, and the position
      of Speaker is filled according to that Rule.  This Rule
      takes precedence over Rules requiring the position of
      Speaker-Elect to be filled by the Order of Succession in
      such a case.

      If a Voter becomes Speaker-Elect during a Arbitration Period
      by winning the game, then the Order of Succession procedure
      shall not be completed, and the Speaker-Elect fills the
      position.  That is,
        -if the position to be filled is Speaker-Elect, the
         Speaker-Elect remains Speaker-Elect.
        -if the position to be filled is Speaker, the Speaker-Elect
         immediately becomes Speaker and the old Speaker becomes a
         Voter.
      In such a case, this Rule takes precedence over any Rule
      requiring the Order of Succession to be completed.

      for the same number of Points, the Speaker shall randomly select
      one of them to become Speaker-Elect.

      If the application of this Rule would result in the Speaker
      becoming the Speaker-Elect, the Speaker shall instead remain
      Speaker, and the Speaker-Elect, if any, shall cease to be

Currency Transfers Mandated by the Rules

      Whenever a Rule directly requires a transfer of Currencies to
      take place, the transfer takes place as required by that Rule,
      provided that the transfer is otherwise permitted by the Rules.

      Such a transfer takes place at the time specified in the Rule
      which requires the transfer, or, if no time is specified, at the
      time when the Rule first begins to require the transfer.

      Whenever an Entity other than a Player to which the Rules have
      granted the authority to require Currency transfers directly
      requires a transfer of Currencies to take place, the transfer
      takes place as required by that Entity, provided that:

      a) the transfer would not result in the Treasury being
         transferred from containing a negative quantity of the
         Currency transferred, and
      b) the transfer is otherwise permitted by the Rules.

      require a transfer prohibited by this Rule.
a4724 8
CFJ 867, Apr. 21 1996: Rule 1597 should be interpreted such that,
whenever a Rule directly requires a transfer of Currencies to take
place, and when the transfer would result in the Treasury being
transferred from containing a negative quantity of the Currency
transferred, the transfer does not take place, unless the Rule
requiring the transfer takes precedence over Rule 1597.
Relevant Rules: 1597, 1596

d4727 1
d4731 1
a4731 1
Rule 1598/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
d4734 2

      Any Player is permitted to require a transfer of Currency to
      take place, provided that:
d4737 1
a4737 4
      a) the transfer would not result in the Treasury from which the
         Currency is being transferred containing a negative quantity
         of the Currency being transferred,
      b) the Player requiring the transfer is the Executor of the
d4740 1
a4740 1
      c) the Player requiring the transfer reports the transfer to the
d4742 2
a4743 1
      d) the transfer is otherwise permitted by the Rules.
d4745 2
a4746 2
      Such a transfer takes place at the time the Player requiring it
      reports it to the Recordkeepor of the Currency transferred.
d4748 2
a4749 2
      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would permit or
      require a transfer prohibited by this Rule.

Private Organizations

      An Organization can only be Private if the Rules defining its
      Class permit (or require) it to be Private.

      If its Class permits Privacy, but does not require it, an
      Organization is not Private unless its Compact claims Privacy.

      Any Organization which is not a Private Organization is a
      Public Organization.

      The Compact of a Private Organization are privileged, and may
      only be divulged by Players within the Compact's Jurisdiction.
      (This defers to the Compact where it forbids such disclosure.)

      The following are the only legal exceptions:

        i) Disclosure of any part of the Compact to a Player
           within its Jurisdiction.
       ii) Disclosure of any part of the Compact to the current
           Notary.
      iii) Disclosure of any part of the Compact to a Judge or
           Justice judging a CFJ, where the Caller of the CFJ is a
           Player within the Compact's Jurisdiction, and the evidence
           provided by the Caller of the CFJ contains text purported
           to be part or all of the Compact.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would require any
      Player to provide the Compact of a Private Organization upon
      request.

Public Organizations

      If its Class permits Privacy, but does not require it, an
      Organization is Public unless its Compact claims Privacy.

      The Compact of a Public Organization must be provided by the
      Administrator of that Organization to any Player As Soon As
      Possible on demand. If, between the time of the demand and the
      time the Administrator fulfills the demand, the Compact has
      changed, the Administrator must provide the Compact as it
      existed at the time of the demand, and must additionally
      document every change made to the Compact between the demand and
      its fulfillment.

      This Rule defers to all other Rules which do not contain this
      sentence.

=======================================
Contracts
  This Category includes Rules defining and regulating
  Contracts and Bearerbonds.
----------------------------------------

Rule 1455/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Contracts

      Let there be a class of Organization known as a Contract, whose
      Compact can also be referred to as a Contract.

      A Contract consists only of Warranties, which are known as its
      Terms, the Players within its Jurisdiction are known as the
      Parties to the Contract, and the Administrator for all Contracts
      is the Notary.

      Contracts do not possess Treasuries, nor do they possess
      Executors.

      Contracts have the legal force to impose penalties upon Parties
      that do not abide by the Terms of the Contract.  Parties that
      are unwilling or unable to abide by the Terms are said to be in
      Breach of the Contract.

      A Contract may specify the following:

        i) What actions the parties to the contract are required to
           perform, or are prohibited from performing, and under what
           conditions these requirements or prohibitions have force.
       ii) What penalties are imposed upon a party who Breaches the
           Contract.

      The Foundors of a Contract must be the set of all Parties to the
      Contract. In addition to what other Rules require them to
      provide to the Notary, the Foundors must also specify the
      following information:

       i) The identity of each Party to the Contract, each of whom
          must be named in the Terms of the Contract itself.

      Providing a unique Name for the Contract is optional, this takes
      precedence over the general requirements for information
      provided.  If no Name is provided, the Notary must provide a
      unique Name for the Contract and provide this Name to all
      Parties.  Parties can then change the Name as provided for in
      the Contract or in other Rules.

      A Contract is Private, and the Notary shall send a notification
      to all the Parties of a Contract As Soon As Possible after it
      has been legally  entered into.  The Contract shall be in force
      no sooner than the moment of that notification.

      A Contract ceases to have force at the moment it is dissolved in
      accordance with its Terms, or one or more of the Parties of the
      Contract ceases to  be a Player, or the Contract is breached as
      described elsewhere.

      When a Contract is changed (including any change in the Parties) a
      current Party to the Contract must inform the Notary of the
      change as soon as possible after it occurs.  If a Party is being
      added to, or removed from, the Contract, the change only has
      effect if _that_ Party sends the notification.  The Notary shall
      forward this notification of change to all current Parties of
      the Contract As Soon As Possible thereafter.

----------------------------------------

Rule 1456/3 (Mutable, MI=1)
Breach of Contract: Definition and Penalties

      A Contract is Breached if any party to the Contract fails, for
      any reason, to perform any action required of em by the
      Contract, or performs, for any reason, any action prohibited of
      em by the Contract. A Breach is officially determined when the
      Notary finds a Player in Violation of the Contract's Terms, as
      described in other Rules.

      If a Party cannot fulfill the Terms of the Contract because to
      do so would  conflict with the Rules, e is required to Breach
      the Contract and must suffer the penalties for a Breach. (This
      applies even if other Rules absolve the Party from obeying the
      Terms.)

      The following shall take place in the event that a party of a
      Contract breaches that contract:

        i) 20 Marks shall be immediately transferred from the
           breaching Player to the Bank.
       ii) The breaching Player shall gain 3 Blots.
      iii) 30 Marks shall be divided as evenly as possible and
           transferred from the breaching Player to each of the other
           parties of the Contract.

      A Contract may specify additional penalties which are to be
      imposed in the event of a breach; however, such penalties shall
      be limited to the transfer of Currencies from the party who
      breached the Contract to any or all of the other Parties of the
      Contract.

      The Notary shall be responsible for reporting all Currency and
      Blot changes which arise as a result of this Rule.

      In the event of a breach, the Notary shall have the authority to
      order all specifically enumerated Currency transfers required by
      the Rules pertaining to Contracts and by the Contract which has
      been Breached. This authority is limited to ordering the
      transfer of Currencies from the Party in breach to the Bank
      and/or to other Parties of the Contract.

      A Voter shall be deregistered when any Player correctly reports
      to the Public Forum that one of the two conditions exists:
d902 3
a904 17
        a. The Voter in question is not On Hold and has not sent a
           message to the Public Forum or to any Player of a nature
           which must be recorded in a Report which then becomes
           publically available during the fourteen day period
           immediately preceding the posting of a message which
           announces that fact, or

        b. The Voter in question has been On Hold for the entire two
           month period immediately preceding the posting of a
           message which announces that fact.

      Upon the posting of any such message, the Registrar, or, in eir
      absence, the Speaker, shall, as soon as possible, determine if
      the claim is correct or not, and announce eir determinations to
      the Public Forum.  If the Registrar fails to make a report
      within seven days, the Speaker shall make the required
      verification and announcement instead.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which might prevent a
      Player from being deregistered against eir own will.

Rule 1431/5 (Mutable, MI=1)
d1008 20
a1027 40
      Any Player (hereafter the Claimant) who believes that any
      message posted to the Public Forum makes a claim about the Game
      State which is in error is permitted to, at eir discretion, post
      to the Public Forum alleging that that message contains an
      error.  Such an allegation is a Claim of Error, and to be
      legal must also specify the nature of the alleged error.

      As soon as possible after a legal Claim of Error is posted, the
      Player who posted the message which contains the alleged error
      (hereafter, the Respondant) shall investigate the allegation of
      error and report to the Public Forum the results of this
      investigation.  If the investigation determines that the
      original claim was in error, the Respondant shall retract that
      claim, replacing it with the corrected version.  A Player who is
      not on Hold who fails to complete such an investigation within
      seven days when required by this Rule commits a Class C Crime.

      The determinations of such an investigation may be challenged by
      a Call for Judgement alleging that the original (or revised)
      claim is in error.

      A Player who is determined by CFJ to have posted an erroneous
      claim to the Public Forum commits an Infraction, the penalty for
      which is 1 Blot, to be reported by the Judge of the CFJ.  This
      penalty only applies if a legal Claim of Error was made upon the
      erroneous claim, and that Claim of Error was either not
      investigated by the Respondant, or was investigated and found to
      be without merit, and finally if the erroneous claim was not
      retracted prior to the making of the CFJ.

      A Claim of Error is not legal and has no effect if:

        a) another Claim of Error has previously been made alleging
           the same error;
        b) the message containing the alleged error was posted more
           than 21 days prior to the making of the Claim of Error;
        c) the claim alleged to be in error has already been withdrawn or
           retracted; or
        d) the Player posting the message alleged to contain the error
           is the same as the Player making the Claim of Error.

Blots and the Immaculate
  This Category includes Rules concerning Blots or the lack
  thereof, and the Office of the Tabulator
----------------------------------------

Rule 1435/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Definition of Blots and Immaculate

      Let there be an Entity called a Blot.  At all times all Players
      possess an integral number of Blots equal to or greater than
      zero.  Any Player with zero Blots is referred to as Immaculate.
      Any new Player, or a Player with no recorded Blots, shall be
      Immaculate.

      Blots may never be transferred between Players.

      A Player who is not Immaculate can't Win the Game. This Rule
      takes precedence over any other rule defining who is eligible to
      Win.

History:
Created by Proposal 1457, Mar. 1 1995

----------------------------------------

Rule 1436/3 (Mutable, MI=1)
The Tabulator

      Let there exist the Office of Tabulator.

      The Tabulator is the Officer responsible for keeping track of
      the Blots possessed by each Player, as well as all ex-Players
      who have Blots.  The Tabulator may have other duties as defined
      in the Rules.

      Once a Week The Tabulator shall post to the Public Forum a
      report of the Blots held by each Player.  If a Player has earned
      Blots since the last report, this report must publicize the
      reason for the gain in Blots.

      The Tabulator's salary shall be four Points per Week.

      If any Rule mandates a change in Blots, but does not also
      specifically state the Player who is Legally Responsible for
      detecting the change and reporting it to the Tabulator, then the
      change in Blots is canceled.

      If a Blot change is not reported within four Weeks of its
      occurrence, or by the end of the Game in which it occurred,
      whichever is sooner, the change in Blots is cancelled.

Amended(2) by Proposal 1735, Oct. 15 1995
Amended(3) by Proposal 2442, Feb. 6 1996

----------------------------------------

Rule 1439/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Blots Due to a CFJ

      If a Call For Judgment (CFJ) clearly alleging that a Player has
      violated a specific Rule is found to be TRUE, the Player
      receives Blots equal to the Mutability Index of the violated
      Rule rounded down to the nearest whole integer, or four Blots if
      its Mutability Index exceeds four.  This Rule defers to the
      wording of the violated Rule when it defines a Blot penalty in
      the specific case of a CFJ, or specifically forbids Blot
      penalties in the case of a CFJ.

      The Player who initially called for the CFJ has the Legal
      Responsibility to report Blots due to the CFJ to the Tabulator.

      If such a Judgement is overturned upon appeal, then the
      Player who received Blots shall lose the same number of
      Blots as were given due to the initial Judgement of the
      CFJ, unless e already had fewer than that number of Blots,
      in which case e shall lose all his Blots.  The Player losing
      the Blots has responsibility for reporting that loss to the
      Tabulator

History:
Created by Proposal 1460, Mar. 1 1995
Amended(1) by Proposal 1674, Aug. 22 1995

----------------------------------------

Rule 1440/2 (Mutable, MI=1)
Erasing Blots

      A Player who has at least one Blot is permitted to remove any or
      all of those Blots by sending a message to the Public Forum
      indicating how many Blots e wishes to remove.  If that Player's
      Treasury contains at least five Points for each Blot to be
      removed, then that number of Points is transferred from the
      Player's Treasury, and the Blots are removed; otherwise, no
      Points are transferred and no Blots are removed.

      The Scorekeepor shall detect and report all transfers and Blot
      Changes resulting from the application of this Rule.

History:
Created by Proposal 1461, Mar. 1 1995
Amended(1) by Proposal 1613, Jul. 10 1995
Amended(2) by Proposal 2472, Feb. 16 1996

----------------------------------------

Rule 1441/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Blots upon Starting a New Game

      Upon beginning a new Game, any Player with Blots immediately
      loses Points equal to the number of eir Blots.  Every Player who
      is not Immaculate has eir total Blots halved, rounding down to
      the next lower integer.  This halving will never reduce a
      Player's total Blots below one.

      Detecting and reporting this Blot change is the Tabulator's
      responsibility.  The Tabulator reports the Point losses to the
      Scorekeepor.

History:
Created by Proposal 1462, Mar. 1 1995

----------------------------------------

Rule 1437/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Blots and Reregistration

      If a Player who is not Immaculate is deregistered and
      subsequently returns to the Game, e returns with B/(2^T) Blots,
      where B is the number of Blots the Player had upon
      deregistering, and T is the number of months since eir
      deregistration.  The number of Blots thus received is rounded
      down to the next whole integer, but not reduced below one Blot.

      If a Immaculate Player deregisters, e is also Immaculate upon
      returning to the Game.

      If a former Player returns to the Game and has no Blots
      recorded, e is Immaculate upon eir return.

      Blot Changes due to this Rule are detected and reported by the
      Tabulator.

      Executor is known as the Group's Vizier.

      A Group is the Mintor of an associated form of Currency.  The
      generic name of all Group Currencies is "Coins."  The specific
      name of a Group's Currency is <name> Coins, where <name> is the

      Group's Membership.  Both the Vizier and the Ordinancekeepor of
      the Group must be Members of the Group.  At all times there must
      be a Vizier and Ordinancekeepor for every Group.

      Whenever a Proposal is Distributed, the Wizard shall create up
      to 3 Style Points and cause them to be transferred to the Player
      who submitted that Proposal, or cause up to 3 Style Points to be 
      transferred from that Player to emself and be destroyed. He
      shall report that transfer, including reasons for eir decision,
      to the Public Forum as soon as possible after a Proposal is

      Points e creates must be transferred to another Player.

      After a Game ends, the Player who had the most Style Points just 
      before the End of the Game and was not The Wizard becomes The

      Let there be a set of Nomic Entities known as Organizations.
      Every individual Organization has associated with it a body of
      text known as its Compact, a Player known as the Organization's
      Administrator, a set of Players who are within the Jurisdiction
      of the Organization's Compact, and a unique specific Name.

      In addition, any Organization which possesses Treasuries has a
      Player who is Executor of the Organization.  An Organization
      only possess Treasuries if the Rules governing that Organization
      specify so.

      The Class of an existing Organization cannot change once that
      Organization is created.

      Each Organization within a specific Class can be properly
      referred to as a singular instance of that Class. (i.e. Every
      Organization within the Class "Groups" can be referred to as a
      Group.)

----------------------------------------

Rule 1529/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Compacts: Statutes, and Warranties

      The Compact of an Organization is a text consisting of
      either or both of the following elements:

         i) Statutes; All Statutes must be obeyed by Players within
            the Compact's Jurisdiction as if those Statues were Rules.

        ii) Warranties; All Warranties shall be obeyed by Players
            within the Compact's Jurisdiction or those Players shall
            invoke penalties defined within the Rules or the Compact.

      A Compact can only possess those elements allowed it by the
      Rules defining its Class of Organization.  If these Rules do not
      specify, the Compact may only consist of Warranties.  If an
      Organization exists whose Class is not defined in the Rules,
      that Organization may not possess a Compact.

      This Rule takes precedence over all other Rules referring to
      Compacts.

 binding, rather than vice versa.]

Rule 1530/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Compacts: Jurisdiction
d6457 3
a6459 5
      The Jurisdiction of an Organization's Compact is a subset of the
      set of all Players. A Compact has no force to require, or
      oblige, anything of Players who are not within its Jurisdiction.
      (This does not absolve any Players of duties required of them by
      the Rules.)
d6461 3
a6463 2
      Within its Jurisdiction, a Compact's ability to dictate Players'
      activity is limited to the extent permitted by the Rules.
d6465 2
a6466 2
      A Compact can only have Jurisdiction over Players permitted to
      it by the Rules governing its Class of Organization.
d6468 6
a6473 2
      No Compact may have effect prior to its Creation, nor may it
      have effect subsequent to its dissolution.
a6474 7
      This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule governing
      Compacts.

[CFJ 818: If the Rules regarding a certain class of Organization are
 silent on which Players can be under Jurisdiction of its Compact,
 Organizations of that class have no Players under its Jurisdiction.]

      Soon As Possible after such changes, distribute an up-to-date
      copy of the Compact to every Player within the Compact's
      Jurisdiction.

      E must also notify the Notary whenever the Executor (if any) of
      eir Organization Changes.  When the Administrator of an
      Organization changes, the new Administrator must inform the
      Notary of this change.  These notifications must be made As Soon
      As Possible.

      The Administrator of an Organization must come from within the
      Jurisdiction of the Organization's Compact unless otherwise
      specified by the Rules governing its Class.

      any and all transfers out of the Organization's Treasury.  The
      Executor may only transfer funds as permitted by the Rules
      governing the Class of the Organization e is Executor of, and e
      may be further bound by the Compact of eir Organization.   The
      Executor of an Organization must come from within the
      Jurisdiction of the Organization's Compact unless otherwise

Rule 1533/3 (Mutable, MI=1)
d6668 13
a6680 22
      Organizations (and, simultaneously, their initial Compacts) are
      created in the following manner:

      A set of Players, known as the Foundors, sends a message to the
      Notary containing the following information:

         i) The Class of the created Organization.
        ii) The Unique Name of the particular Organization being
            created.
       iii) The initial Compact for the proposed Organization.
        iv) Any information required by Rules governing that specific
            Class of Organization.

      The Organization is created, and its Foundors enter the
      Jurisdiction of its Compact, once the Notary receives the above
      information from all Founders required by the Rules governing
      the Organization's Class.  If such Foundors are not defined, the
      Organization cannot be created.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which does not
      explicitly state that it takes precedence over the default Rules
      for Organizations.

      An Organization ceases to exist when any of the following
      conditions become true:
d6696 7
a6702 23
        i) Its Compact ceases to have Jurisdiction over any Players
           and no provision exists for the Jurisdiction to expand.
       ii) The continued existence of the Organization would result in
           the absence of a Administrator (and/or the absence of an
           Executor in the case of a Organization with Treasuries)
           with no provision for any Player to fulfill the role(s).
      iii) The Organization is required to dissolve in accordance with
           its Compact or the Rules.

      At the moment an Organization dissolves, the following occurs,
      in order.

        i) Any Currencies remaining in the Organization's Treasuries
           (if such exist) are distributed as provided for by other
           Rules.
       ii) All Players cease to be within the Jurisdiction of the
           Organization's Compact.
      iii) The Organization's Treasuries, Compact, and the
           Organization itself, cease to exist.

      Whenever a Public Organization dissolves, the Notary shall
      report that event to the Public Forum As Soon As Possible after
      e is notified as required by other Rules.

      If an Organization is to dissolve, and if a provision exists
      within its Compact for dividing its Treasuries (if any) upon
      dissolution, the Treasuries are divided in accordance with this
      provision before its dissolution.  Otherwise, the Treasuries are
      divided as evenly as possible among all Players within the
      Compact's Jurisdiction before its dissolution.

      The Executor of the Organization notifies all appropriate
      Recordkeepors of the above Transfers.  If no Executor exists,
      and there is no provision in the Rules or the Compact for
      someone to act as Executor, all Treasuries' contents go to the
      Bank. (Detected by the relevant Recordkeepors.)
d6752 2

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules demanding a
      different distribution of such Treasuries' assets.

      The Compact of an Organization can specify any or all of the
      following.
d6767 3
a6769 32
        i) How the Compact, and/or the Name of its Organization, can
           be Changed. If this is not specified, it may only be
           changed by unanimous consent of Players within the
           Compact's Jurisdiction.  Consent is shown by a Player by
           sending an identical copy of the change to the Notary.  The
           change takes effect when the last Player so consents.

           In all cases, when the Name of an Organization changes, the
           Administrator must inform the Notary of the new Name As
           Soon As Possible.

       ii) How the Organization can be dissolved.  If this is not
           specified, the Organization cannot dissolve unless it is
           required to do so by the Rules.

           As Soon As Possible after an Organization's dissolution,
           the Player who was the last Administrator of that
           Organization must inform the Notary of that Organization's
           dissolution

      iii) How additional Players enter the Jurisdiction of the
           Compact.  If this is not specified, the Compact cannot
           expand its Jurisdiction.

       iv) How individual Players leave the Jurisdiction of the
           Compact.  If this is not specified, the Compact can only
           lose Jurisdiction over a Player when the Rules require it
           to do so.

           Whenever there is any change in a Compact's Jurisdiction,
           the Administrator of its Organization must inform the
           Notary of the change As Soon As Possible.

Compacts as Evidence

      the Administrator of that Organization is required to provide a
      copy of that Compact to the Judge or Justice As Soon As Possible
      after the Judge's or Justice's request.

      If this involves a Compact from a Private Organization, the
      Judge or Justice receiving it is bound by the strictures
      governing the dissemination of the contents of that Compact, and
      is prohibited from attaching a copy of it to eir Judgement as
      evidence.

      This takes precedence over any Rule which would require a Judge
      or Justice to include the Compact of a Private Organization as
      part of the evidence justifying eir Ruling.

      Each Rule that permits an Organization of a specific Class to be
      a Mintor must define a unique generic name for every type of
      Currency associated with that Class of Organization.

      The name of any Currency associated with a specific Organization
      shall be the Name of the Organization followed by the unique
      generic name defined by the Class of that Organization.

      The Recordkeepor of any Organization's Currency is the Executor
      of the associated Organization.  The MUQ of all such Currencies
      is 1.

      A Treasury is a repository for holding Currencies.  Currencies
      may exist only within a Treasury.  A Treasury may contain a
      positive, negative, or zero quantity of a given Currency, unless
      otherwise prohibited by the Rules.  Currencies may be
      transferred between Treasuries only as specified in the Rules.

      Only those Nomic Entities which are authorized by the Rules to
      possess Treasuries may possess Treasuries.  No Treasury may be
      possessed by more than one Nomic Entity.  The possession of
      Treasuries may never be changed, once created.

      Each Player and each Group has a Treasury of its own.

      Whenever an Entity possesses only one Treasury, it shall be a
      permissible and unambiguous abbreviation to state that the
      Entity possesses the Currencies within its Treasury.

      a new Treasury shall initially contain no Currencies, unless
      otherwise specified in the Rules.

      Whenever an Entity which possesses a Treasury ceases to exist or
      ceases to be permitted to possess a Treasury, all Currencies
      within are immediately transferred to the Treasuries of the
      Mintors of the respective Currencies, and the Treasury itself

      which is also required to be reported in the Public Forum, in
      which case that notification is sufficient, and no further
      notification is required of the Banker.

      A legal notification of the destruction of a Treasury is also,
      by implication, a report of the transfer of all Currencies
      within that Treasury to their Mintors as required by this Rule.

      one Game and no more than one Game, and they all Win the same
      Game), with Kelly becoming the Speaker-Elect. This Rules takes
      precedence over any other Rule for determining the identity of
      the Speaker-Elect when a Game has been Won. For the purposes of
      Rule 112, Wes, Vanyel, Steve and Kelly all count as having
      fulfilled a Win condition defined by this Rule.

      Furthermore, 2 Extra Votes are transferred from the Bank to the
      Treasury of each Player, excepting Wes, Vanyel, Steve and
      Kelly, who cast exactly one vote FOR and no votes AGAINST the
      Proposal whose adoption resulted in the creation of this Rule.

      Furthermore, 4 Extra Votes are transferred from the Bank to the
      Treasury of each Player, excepting Wes, Vanyel, Steve and
      Kelly, who cast exactly 2 votes FOR and no votes AGAINST the
      Proposal whose adoption resulted in the creation of this Rule.

      All transfers of Extra Votes occurring as a result of this
      Rule, including transfers of Extra Votes occurring as the
      result of the awarding of Champion's Rewards to Wes, Vanyel,

      A Player may choose to be placed On Hold at any time by sending
      a message indicating such to the Public Forum.  A Player may not
      place any other Player besides emself on Hold.  A Player may
      cease to be On Hold by sending a message indicating such to the
      Public Forum, so long as it has been at least 96 hours since e
      last went On Hold.  An Active Player is a Player who is not On
      Hold.

      While On Hold, a Player may not Vote, propose Proposals,
      or campaign for or hold Office.  E is also absolved of any
      duties which would otherwise be required of em, including
      appointment as a Judge.

      This rule takes precedence over any rule giving special duties
      to a particular player or a particular group of players.

 voting result.

d957 40
a996 58
      If a Player, hereafter called the Claimant, believes any
      official report or document to contain an error, e shall at eir
      discretion post to the Public Forum a statement that e believes
      the report to be in error, specifying the nature of the error,
      and requesting the Player responsible for the document,
      hereafter called the Respondant, to correct the error.  The
      Respondant shall immediately investigate the claim of error,
      and, as soon as possible after the posting of the claim, either
      admit the claim and issue an official correction to the
      document, or deny the claim.  Such admission or denial shall be
      posted to the Public Forum.

      If and only if the Respondant does not admit the claim, then
      any Player may, within one week of the posted denial (or the
      expiration of any prescribed time limit for the Respondant's
      response), make a Call for Judgement alleging the document to
      be in error in the way in which the Claim of Error alleged it
      to be in error.

      If and only if the Respondant admits the claim, then any Player
      may, within one week of the posted admission (or the expiration
      of any prescribed time limit for the Respondant's response),
      make a Call for Judgement alleging that the document is not in
      error in the way in which the Claim of Error alleged it to be
      in error.

      If the Respondant does not admit the claim and a subsequent Call
      for Judgement finds that the claim is true, the Respondant shall
      lose 5 points.  The Claimant is responsible for reporting this
      score change when it occurs.  There is no penalty under this
      Rule if the Respondant admits the claim and corrects the error
      without a Call for Judgement having been made.

      A claim is illegal and may not be made if:
        a) another claim has previously been made alleging the same
           error, unless this prior claim was not admitted and the
           time limit to make a CFJ has expired;
        b) the document containing the error was published more than
           21 days prior to the claim; or
        c) the Player making the claim is the same as the Player
           responsible for the document alleged to be in error.
        d) the report in error has been superceded by another report.
      
      For the purpose of this Rule, an "official report or document"
      is any report or document which an Officer (or the Speaker) is
      required to maintain by the Rules in the course of eir duties as
      that Officer (or as Speaker), and an "error" is the omission or
      inclusion of any information which causes the official report or
      document to allege that the Game State is in any way different
      than it actually is.

      No Call for Judgement may be made alleging that a document
      contains errors except as prescribed in this Rule.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which might allow a
      Call for Judgement prohibited by this Rule to be made, or which
      might prohibit a Call for Judgement permitted by the Rule from
      being made.

      A player may disown eir own proposal if it has not yet been
      distributed or if no more than four days have passed since its 
      distribution, by sending a statement disowning it to the Public 
      Forum.  

      The player so disowning a proposal loses a flat fee of five
      points, reported by the Assessor, but any other score changes,
      blots, or other effects resulting from the player's submission
      of that proposal, including but not limited to formatting
      penalties, rule repeal rewards, new player bonuses, and awards
      or penalties for votes cast on that proposal are cancelled and
      shall not be taken into account.  The disowning Player does not
      receive any Extra Votes for a Proposal he disowned, even if it
      passes. 

      Neither the Assessor nor any Player who has been Assessor since
      the beginning of the voting period on that proposal may disown a
      proposal, unless that proposal has not yet been distributed. 

      This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which would
      otherwise seek to reward or penalize any player based on the
      disowned proposal.

      If Players disagree about the legality of a Move or the
      interpretation or application of a Rule, then a Player may
      invoke Judgement by submitting a Statement for Judgement to the
      Clerk of the Courts.  Disagreement, for the purposes of this
      Rule, may be created by the insistence of any Player.  When
      Judgement is invoked, the Clerk of the Courts must, as soon as
      possible, select a Judge as described in the Rules.  The Clerk
      of the Courts must then distribute the Statement to be judged,
      along with the identity of the Judge, to all Players.

      No Player shall submit more than five CFJ's per week.

a2449 25
      A "Move" refers to any specific action taken by a Player or
      group of Players in the context of the game. Any invocation of
      Judgement must satisfy one or more of the following conditions:

          - clearly allege that a specific Move is illegal;
          - clearly allege that a specific Rule is illegal or lacking
            in legal force, in whole or in part;
          - clearly allege that a specific Rule ought to be
            interpreted in a certain way.
          - clearly allege, either implicitly or explicitly, that the
            Rules generally ought to be interpreted in a certain way.
          - clearly allege that a specific Ordinance, Regulation,
            or Contract ought to be interpreted in a certain way.
          - clearly allege, either implicitly or explicitly, that the
            Ordinances of a specific Group or the Regulations of
            a specific Contract ought to be interpreted in a certain
            way.
          - clearly allege that the current published game state is
            incorrect, and in what respects.

      A CFJ which does not satisfy at least one of the above
      conditions shall be deemed invalid and shall not be accepted for
      Judgement by the Clerk of the Courts. However, this Rule shall
      defer to rules which explicitly permit CFJs that do not
      necessarily meet the above conditions.

a2517 27
      Upon receipt of a Call For Judgement (CFJ), the Clerk of the
      Courts (CotC) shall randomly appoint a Player to Judge that
      CFJ from amongst the Eligible Players. For the purposes of this
      Rule, the Eligible Players shall be the set of Players excluding 
      those:

        (i) who are On Hold;
       (ii) who are Barred from Judging the CFJ;
      (iii) who made the CFJ;
       (iv) who have declined to be Appointed as Judge on the CFJ;
        (v) who are otherwise ineligible to Judge as specified in the
            Rules.

      Players may decline to be Appointed as Judge on a particular
      CFJ by notifying the CotC within 72 hours of appointment.  The
      declining Player shall not be Eligible to serve as Judge for
      that CFJ and shall also lose two points, one of which shall be
      given to the CotC.  No Blots are gained by the declining Player.
      The Clerk of the Courts shall report Point transfers wihch occur
      as a result of this Rule.

      If for any reason a Player who has been selected as a Judge of
      a CFJ becomes ineligible to Judge, either by declining
      Appointment, by going On Hold, by being deregistered and hence
      ceasing to be a Player, or by other means specified in the
      Rules, then the CotC shall randomly select another Eligible
      Player to Judge the CFJ.

      After the Clerk of the Courts has distributed the Statement to
      be judged and the identity of the Judge, the Judge has one week
      in which to deliver a legal Judgement.  If the Judge fails to
      deliver a Judgement within this time, e gains 3 Blots and the
      CotC randomly selects another Judge from among eligible Players.
      A Judgement is delivered by submitting that Judgement to the
      Clerk of the Courts, who must then distribute that Judgement to
      all Players as soon as possible.

      Blots gained via this rule are reported to the Tabulator by the
      CotC.

d2641 1

Rule 591/2 (Mutable, MI=1)
d2644 10
a2653 28
      A legal Judgement is either TRUE, FALSE, UNDECIDABLE, or
      UNKNOWN.  The Judgement of UNDECIDABLE is reserved for those
      statements which are logically neither TRUE nor FALSE.  The
      Judgement of UNKNOWN is for those statements for which the
      Judge is unable to obtain information necessary to determine
      whether the statement is TRUE, FALSE, or UNDECIDABLE.

      The Judge must make a reasonable effort to obtain all
      information necessary to determine whether the statement
      is TRUE, FALSE, or UNDECIDABLE.

      The Judgement must be accompanied by reasons and arguments,
      which include, but are not necessarily limited to, citations of
      deciding Rules, past Judgements, and game custom. A Judgement
      delivered without reasons and/or arguments is completely
      invalid.

      Such reasons and arguments form no part of the Judgement itself.
      However, the Clerk of the Courts must distribute the reasons and
      arguments along with the Judgement.

      Any evidence which is used to justify the Judgement, other than
      appeals to Game Custom or to common sense, must be presented by
      the Judge.  If the Judge introduces evidence beyond that
      submitted in the Call for Judgement, e must include this
      evidence in eir Judgement.  All such added evidence must be
      distributed as part of the reasons and arguments by the Clerk of
      the Courts.

      the Judge's Blots below one.  It is the Judge's responsibility
      to report eir Blot losses to the Tabulator.

a2848 33
      There shall be an entity known as an Injunction, which may
      accompany certain Judgements of TRUE, FALSE, or UNDECIDABLE as
      provided in the rules. An Injunction is a statement or series of
      statements specifying an action or actions which must take
      place. If a Judgement is accompanied by an Injunction, that
      Injunction must be published with the Judgement. All players
      must abide by the Injunction beginning no later than 72 hours
      after its publication unless one of the following conditions
      then apply:
        - The Judgement which the Injunction accompanies is undergoing
          appeal, currently UNKNOWN as a consequence of the appeal
          process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but a proposal
          has been published which would overturn that decision if
          passed, and said proposal has not failed.
        - The validity of the Injunction itself is questioned by a
          pending CFJ.
        - A Judgement upholding the validity of the Injunction is
          undergoing appeal, currently UNKNOWN as a consequence of
          the appeal process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but
          a proposal has been published which would overturn that
          decision if passed, and said proposal has not failed.

      A Judgement may not be accompanied by an Injunction unless it is
      specifically permitted elsewhere in the rules. An Injunction
      must be completely consistent with all rules in effect at the
      time of issuance, and must be completely relevant to the matter
      addressed in the corresponding judgement.

      If any Player believes that an Injunction or any part of it does
      not meet the criteria for a valid Injunction, e may submit a CFJ
      to that effect. If the resulting Judgement supports the
      contention that the criteria are not met, the Injunction shall
      be considered illegal and shall have no legal force.

Injuction--Retracting an Illegal Move
d2909 2
a2910 26
      If a CFJ alleges that a specific Move is illegal, and the
      Judgement supports the allegation, the Judge may include with
      the Judgement an Injunction specifying that the move is to be
      retracted, if the Judge thinks it is appropriate to do so. The
      Judge may also issue an Injunction specifying any adjustments
      to the published game state which result from the allegation
      being supported. These adjustments to the game state must have
      been unambiguously specified within the CFJ, and they must be
      adjustments which occur as a direct or indirect result of the
      allegation being supported.

[CFJ 697: Such an Injunction may not specify, "all errors in the
 Public Gamestate resulting from this Error, including but not
 limited to..." as the adjustments are not unambiguously specified.
 CFJs 708 & 714: Such an Injunction may not forbid resulting illegal
 actions which have not yet taken place.
 CFJ 716: Other changes to the Gamestate may not be retracted if
 retracting the illegal move is not part of the Injunction.
 CFJ 724: Such an Injunction may only be made if the CFJ explicitly
 alleges that a certain move is illegal.
 CFJ 729: Such an Injunction may not roll back the Gamestate to before
 the illegal move occurred, if that would mean actions not dependent
 on the illegal action would be retracted.]
 CFJ 736: If a move is illegal, that does not imply that the move has
 not been made.
 CFJ 797: The CFJ itself need not specify the Injunction.]

      When a CFJ alleging that a Statute or a Warranty (hereinafter
      the Target) should be interpreted in a certain way is Judged
      TRUE, the Judge may include with the Judgement an Injunction
      requiring the Administrator of the Organization whose Compact
      contains the Target to annotate the Target with the Statement in
      the CFJ.

      The annotation shall remain only until the Target is changed in
      any way; or until a CFJ determines that the injunction no longer
      applies, as described below.  While it remains, it shall guide
      the application of the Target.

      If a Player believes that the circumstances which led to the
      Judgement no longer prevail and the annotation is therefore no
      longer applicable, e may submit a CFJ to that effect. If it is
      Judged TRUE, the annotation shall be stricken from the Target.

      If within two weeks after a Judgement is distributed to the
      Public Forum, three players post to the Public Forum their
      insistence that it be appealed, then the judgement is Appealed.

      If a judgement is Appealed, the Clerk of the Courts shall within
      one week report this to the Public Forum, together with the
      statement of the CFJ.

      When this happens, the Speaker, CotC, and Justiciar shall serve
      as Justices, judging the statement as if they were Judges.  The
      Justices may confer with each other on the case before
      delivering Judgement if they desire.

      A Justice may appoint another willing Player to act as Justice;
      the player so appointed becomes Justice in eir place. A Justice
      who was ineligible to serve as Judge of the CFJ, or who was
      Judge of the CFJ, may not deliver judgement as Justice, but must
      instead so appoint another player, as soon as possible.

      No Player may deliver judgement more than once on the same CFJ; 
      rather than do so as Justice e must instead appoint another
      player to act as Justice, as soon as possible.

      If a Justice, A, is required by the Rules to appoint another
      Player as Justice, he may do so by declaring to the CotC that e
      is unable to find another willing player to so serve; in this
      case the CotC shall as soon as possible select an eligible
      player at random to serve as Justice in place of A.

      A Currency is a type of Nomic Entity.  Only those Nomic Entities
      which are specifically defined by the Rules as being Currencies
      are Currencies.

      A Currency must have a Name (which must not be the name of any
      other Currency), a minimum unit quantity, a Recordkeepor, and a
      Mintor.  The Mintor of a Currency is the Mint if it is not
      otherwise defined.

      The minimum unit quantity (MUQ) of a Currency is the smallest
      amount of that Currency which may be transferred.  All
      transfers, holdings, and calculations involving a given Currency
      shall be rounded off to the nearest multiple of its MUQ.  The
      MUQ of a given Currency is 1, unless another Rule specifies a
      different MUQ for that Currency.

      The Recordkeepor of a Currency is the Player who is required to
      maintain a record of the amount of that Currency held in the
      various Treasuries which exist.  If a Currency ceases to have a
      valid Recordkeepor, the Banker (or, in eir absence, the Speaker)
      shall fulfill that responsibility until a new Recordkeepor is
      selected according to the appropriate procedures.  If no
      procedure exists to select a new recordkeepor, all units of the
      Currency are instead destroyed, and the Currency ceases to
      exist.

      The Mintor of a Currency is the Nomic Entity which is authorized
      to create and destroy units of that Currency.  If the Mintor of
      a Currency ceases to exist, all units of the Currency are
      immediately destroyed, and the Currency also ceases to exist.

a4373 61
      It shall be legal to transfer Currencies between Treasuries,
      provided this is done in accordance with the Rules.  Every
      transfer shall involve a positive amount of exactly one
      Currency, which shall be transferred from exactly one Treasury
      into exactly one other Treasury.  Every transfer has an
      initiator, which is the Entity which causes the transfer to take
      place.

      A transfer which is explicitly and directly required to take
      place by a Rule is initiated by that Rule, and is called a Class
      I Transfer.

      A transfer which is required to take place by an Entity (other
      than the Rules) to which the Rules have granted the power to
      require Currency Transfers to take place is initiated by that
      Entity (_not_ the Rule which grants that power to that Entity),
      and is called a Class II Transfer.

      A transfer which is not required to take place, and which is
      instead the consequence of a Player's action, is initiated by
      that Player, and is a called a Class III Transfer.

      For the purpose of this Rule, a Rule, or an Entity other than
      the Rules to which the Rules have granted the power to require
      Players to perform actions, which requires a Player to initiate
      a transfer is _not_ requiring the transfer.  Such a transfer is
      a Class III transfer initiated by that Player.  This Rule takes
      precedence over any Rule which would require a Player to
      initiate a transfer which is prohibited by this Rule.

      A Class I transfer is not permitted if there is no Rule which
      specifies a Player who is to detect and report the transfer.

      A Class II transfer is not permitted if there is no Rule, or
      Entity other than the Rules to which the Rules have granted the
      power to require Players to perform actions, which specifies a
      Player who is to detect and report the transfer.

      A Class II or Class III Transfer is not permitted if the
      Treasury from which the Currency is being transferred will
      possess a negative quantity of that Currency after the transfer
      has been completed.

      A Class III Transfer is not permitted unless the transfer is
      initiated by the Executor of the Owner of the Treasury from
      which the Currency is being transferred.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would permit a
      transfer prohibited by this Rule.

      The Recordkeepor of a Currency must be notified of a transfer
      involving that Currency within seven days, unless another Rule
      specifies a different time limit for reporting a certain type of
      transfer.  For a Class I or Class II transfer, the notification
      shall be made by the Player required to detect and report it.
      For a Class III transfer, the notification shall be made by the
      Player who initiated it.

      Class I and Class II transfers take place at the time they are
      required to take place.  Class III transfers take place at the
      time they are reported.

      Let there be an Entity known as the Nomic Potato.  There is only
      one Potato which cannot be destroyed.  The Potato can be
      possessed by any Agora Player who owns Extra Votes (EVs).  A
      Player with no EVs cannot possess the Potato, and if the Player
      possessing the Potato ever ceases to own EVs, e also loses
      possession of the Potato.

      If the Potato's possessor ceases to possess the Potato though
      ceasing to own EVs, or ceasing to be a Player, or in any other
      way not otherwise described by the Rules pertaining to the Nomic
      Potato, the possession of the Potato immediately passes to the
      Player who owns the greatest number of EVs.
d4843 1
a4843 50
      If more than one Player is tied for the greatest number of EVs,
      the Potato is transferred to the tied Player who:
      
        i) Has not previously possessed the Potato; providing all
           other tied Players have previously possessed the Potato.

       ii) Has not possessed the Potato for the longest consecutive
           period of time immediately prior to the Potato's transfer;
           providing all other tied Players have previously possessed
           the Potato.

      iii) has been randomly selected by the Assessor,
           provided neither i) or ii) apply.

      As long as at least one Player owns EVs, the Potato is always in
      some Player's possession. The only time that the Potato is not
      possessed by a Player is when no Player owns EVs.

      The Assessor keeps track of who possesses the Potato.

Benefits and Hazards of possessing the Potato

      The Player possessing the Potato receives the following
      benefits:

        i) e receives five points from the Bank for every full Nomic
           week e possesses the Potato.

       ii) e receives three points from the Bank for every EV e spends
           while e possesses the Potato.  (These points are received
           at the time the vote is cast, and the Potato must be
           possessed at that time.)

      iii) e receives fifteen points and 1 EV from the Bank when 
           another Player spends five points to transfer the
           Potato away from eir possession.

     The Player possessing the Potato suffers the following penalties:

       i) e loses two EVs for every full Nomic week e possesses the
          Potato and does not spend at least one EV while voting.
          (This does not apply during any Nomic Week in which no
          Proposals are up for vote.)

      EV changes as a result of this rule are detected by the

Rule 1489/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
The Potato is Transferred

      Any Player who does not possess the Potato can spend five points
      to transfer the Potato to any Player who can legally own the
      Potato.  (This can even be to the transferring Player, provided
      e may possess the Potato.)  Each Player is limited to one such
      transfer every week.

      The transfer is made when the transferring Player posts a
      message in the Public Forum, reporting to the Assessor which
      Player the Potato is being transferred to. If the Player being
      transferred to is eligible to possess the Potato, and the
      transferring Player possesses at least five points, the transfer
      is made and the Assessor reports the transferring Player's score
      change to the Scorekeepor.  The five points go to the Bank.

Contests

      A "Contest" is an Organization of Class Contest; this Class is a
      valid Class of Organization.

      All Contests are Public Organizations.  The Jurisdiction of a
      Contest is permitted to contain any Player.  Each Contest shall
      possess exactly one Treasury.  The Executor of a Contest is, at
      all times, its Administrator.

      A Contest must have exactly one Foundor, who becomes the
      Contest's initial Administrator.

      The following definitions pertain to Contests:

      * Regulations: a synonym for a Contest's Compact.
      * Contestmaster: a synonym for a Contest's Administrator.
      * Contest Fund: a synonym for a Contest's Treasury.
      * Contestant: a Player who is part of a Contest's Jurisdiction,
        but who is not the Contest's Administrator.

[CFJ 760: If the Regulations specify that the position of
 Contestmaster is to be vacated, that is without effect.
 CFJ 800: A Contest need not be a game in the strict sense of the
 word.]

a439 18
      Violation of a Compact means the failure to obey (insofar the
      Rules require) the text of a Compact by a Player within that
      Compact's Jurisdiction. Such a Violation is either Civil or
      Basic.

      Violations of a Statute are Basic Violations can also be
      Violations of the Rules empowering the Violated Statutes.

      Violations of a Warranty are Civil Violations are never, by
      themselves, Rule Violations.

      Any other Violation is Basic, unless the Rules define it
      otherwise.

      No Player shall legally be in Violation of a Compact or any
      other body of text having Coercive Power over that Player if its
      text has not been made available to that Player at the time of
      the suspected Violation.

      Offices are a class of Nomic Entities, referring generically
      to a position of authority or responsibility in Agora Nomic.
d849 2
a850 16
      An Office exists only if it is specifically established by the
      Rules.  If an Office ceases to be specified in the Rules, it
      ceases to exist.

      An Officer is any Player who fills an Office as specified in the
      Rules.  No Player shall be required to fill an Office without
      giving consent.  A Player indicates that e consents to fill an
      Office by posting to the Public Forum that e does so.  To be
      binding, such a post must be made not more than one week before,
      nor more than one week after, the time that the Player is
      designated to fill the Office in question.

      It is forbidden for two or more Players to hold the same Office
      at the same time.  If the Rules require that a specific Player
      fill an Office, any other Player who currently fills that Office
      ceases to do so simultaneously.

      An Officer may resign eir Office at any time either by a message
      to the Public Forum, or by going On Hold, or as otherwise
      specified in the Rules.

      When an Officer resigns eir Office, e ceases to fill that
      Office.  If an Officer resigns during the Voting Period for a
      Proposal containing a Directive to install another player in
      that Office, then the Player thus proposed, if consenting, will
      fill the Office.

      Otherwise, if at the time e resigns e appoints a successor, then
      the designated successor, if consenting, will fill the Office.
      If there is no appointed or proposed successor, or if e does not
      consent to fill the Office, then the Office becomes vacant.

Confidentiality of Contracts

      An Organization can only be Private if the Rules defining its
      Class permit (or require) it to be Private.

      If its Class permits Privacy, but does not require it, an
      Organization is not Private unless its Compact claims Privacy.

      Any Organization which is not a Private Organization is a
      Public Organization.

      The Compact of a Private Organization are privileged, and may
      only be divulged by Players within the Compact's Jurisdiction.
      (This defers to the Compact where it forbids such disclosure.)

      The following are the only legal exceptions:

        i) Disclosure of any part of the Compact to a Player
           within its Jurisdiction.
       ii) Disclosure of any part of the Compact to the current
           Notary.
      iii) Disclosure of any part of the Compact to a Judge or
           Justice judging a CFJ, where the Caller of the CFJ is a

           provided by the Caller of the CFJ contains text purported
           to be part or all of the Compact.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would require any
      Player to provide the Compact of a Private Organization upon
      request.

Breach of Contract: Judicial Procedure

      When any Player within the Jurisdiction of a Compact believes
      the Compact to have been Violated by another Player, e shall
      inform the Administrator of that Compact's Organization of that
      belief, along with the nature of the Violation, the Violated

      The Administrator shall then, As Soon As Possible, distribute
      this information to all Players within the Jurisdiction of the
      Violated Compact.

      If, within seven days of this distribution, no Player within the

      shall declare the Compact Violated.  The Administrator is then
      allowed to initiate any corrections and penalties allowed by the
      Rules and eir Organization's Compact.

      If, however, any Player under the Compact's Jurisdiction
      disputes the claim of Violation within seven days, then any
      Player within the Compact's Jurisdiction may submit a Call for
      Judgement, alleging that a specific Player has Violated the
      Compact. Such a Call for Judgement cannot be made in any other
      circumstance.

      All Players within the Compact's Jurisdiction are automatically
      ineligible to Judge such a CFJ.

      In the event that such a CFJ is found TRUE, the Compact has
      been Violated and the Compact's Administrator shall perform the
      same duties as when no Player contests the claim.  In the event
      that such a CFJ is found FALSE, the Player which called the CFJ
      shall lose 5 Marks to the Bank; this transfer shall be detected
      and reported by the Administrator of the Compact's Organization,
      if the Organization does not possess a Treasury, by its Executor
      otherwise.

The just-distributed Ruleset is in error, in that the MI of Rule

Roles in a Bearerbond

      Within the Terms of a Bearerbond, one or more of the Parties
      are identified only by unique abstract Role names. (such as
      Bearer, or Party of the First Part and Party of the Second Part,
      or Feduciacrator, Honker, and Trusiast, or whatever)  At all
      times, exactly one Player is associated with each Role; the
      Player associated with a particular Role is known as the
      Rolebearer for that Role in that Bearerbond.

      When the Bearerbond is created, all Foundors must send the
      Notary a statement clearly identifying the initial Rolebearer
      for each Role in the Bearerbond.  All these statements must
      identify the same Rolebearers for the same Roles.

      All Rolebearers are Parties of the Bearerbond as long as they
      are Rolebearers.

Rule 1545/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Changing Rolebearers in a Bearerbond

      To change the Rolebearer for some Role in a Bearerbond, the
      current Rolebearer and the new Rolebearer notify the Notary
      of the transaction, clearly indicating the unique abstract Role
      name, and the Name of the Bearerbond.

      The Rolebearer for any Role may be changed in this way at any
      time, unless the Terms of the Bearerbond state differently.

      When any Rolebearer in a Bearerbond changes, the Notary shall
      notify all Parties to that Bearerbond of the change, the Role
      involved, and the identity of the new Rolebearer.  This
      notification shall occur As Soon As Possible.  The change of
      Rolebearer takes effect when the Notary sends this notification.

      Directives which are defined by the Rules may be placed in a
      Proposal.

      If a Proposal containing Directives is adopted, the Directives
      shall take effect in the order that they appear in the Proposal,
      and according to the Rule or Rule which define the type of each
      Directive in question.

      The Adoption Index of a Proposal containing a Directive must be
      at least as great as that required by the Rule or Rules which

Dissolution of Organizations

      An Organization ceases to exist when any of the following
      conditions become true:

        i) Its Compact ceases to have Jurisdiction over any Players
           and no provision exists for the Jurisdiction to expand.
       ii) The continued existence of the Organization would result in
           the absence of a Administrator (and/or the absence of an
           Executor in the case of a Orginization with Treasuries)
           with no provision for any Player to fulfill the role(s).
      iii) The Organization is required to dissolve in accordance with
           its Compact or the Rules.

      At the moment an Organization dissolves, the following occurs,
      in order.

        i) Any Currencies remaining in the Organization's Treasuries
           (if such exist) are distributed as provided for by other
           Rules.
       ii) All Players cease to be within the Jurisdiction of the
           Organization's Compact.
      iii) The Organization's Treasuries, Compact, and the
           Organization itself, cease to exist.

      Whenever a Public Organization dissolves, the Notary shall
      report that event to the Public Forum As Soon As Possible after
      e is notified as required by other Rules.

      Other Rules may define additional causes of dissolution.

Rule 1457/2 (Mutable, MI=1)
Judicial Procedure for Compact Violations

      When any Player within the Jurisdiction of a Compact believes
      the Compact to have been Violated by another Player, e shall
      inform the Administrator of that Compact's Organization of that
      belief, along with the nature of the Violation, the Violated
      text of the Compact, and the identity of the Violating Player.
      The Administrator shall then, As Soon As Possible, distribute
      this information to all Players within the Jurisdiction of the
      Violated Compact.

      If, within seven days of this distribution, no Player within the
      Compact's Jurisdiction disputes the claim, the Administrator
      shall declare the Compact Violated.  The Administrator is then
      allowed to initiate any corrections and penalties allowed by the
      Rules and eir Organization's Compact.

      If, however, any Player under the Compact's Jurisdiction
      disputes the claim of Violation within seven days, then any
      Player within the Compact's Jurisdiction may submit a Call for
      Judgement, alleging that a specific Player has Violated the
      Compact. Such a Call for Judgement cannot be made in any other
      circumstance.

      All Players within the Compact's Jurisdiction are automatically
      ineligible to Judge such a CFJ.

      In the event that such a CFJ is found TRUE, the Compact has
      been Violated and the Compact's Administrator shall perform the
      same duties as when no Player contests the claim.  In the event
      that such a CFJ is found FALSE, the Player which called the CFJ
      shall lose 5 Marks to the Bank; this transfer shall be detected
      and reported by the Administrator of the Compact's Organization,
      if the Organization does not possess a Treasury, by its Executor
      otherwise.

      An Organization can only be Private if the Rules defining its

d5903 3
a5905 32
      If its Class permits Privacy, but does not require it, an
      Organization is not Private unless its Compact claims Privacy.

      Any Organization which is not a Private Organization is a
      Public Organization.

      The Compact of a Private Organization are privileged, and may
      only be divulged by Players within the Compact's Jurisdiction.
      (This defers to the Compact where it forbids such disclosure.)

      The following are the only legal exceptions:

        i) Disclosure of any part of the Compact to a Player
           within its Jurisdiction.
       ii) Disclosure of any part of the Compact to the current
           Notary.
      iii) Disclosure of any part of the Compact to a Judge or
           Justice judging a CFJ, where the Caller of the CFJ is a
           Player within the Compact's Jurisdiction, and the evidence
           provided by the Caller of the CFJ contains text purported
           to be part or all of the Compact.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would require any
      Player to provide the Compact of a Private Organization upon
      request.

      collectively as its Ordinances, an individual Statute of its
      Compact is known as an Ordinance.  Its Administrator is known as
      the Group's Ordinancekeepor.  A Group has one Treasury, and its
      Executor is known as the Group's Vizier.

      A Group is the Mintor of an associated form of Currency.  The
      generic name of all Group Currencies is "Coins."  The specific
      name of a Group's Currency is <name> Coins, where <name> is the
      Name of the Group.

      Players within the Ordinances' Jurisdiction are known as the
      Group's Membership.  Both the Vizier and the Ordinancekeepor of
      the Group must be Members of the Group.  At all times there must
      be a Vizier and Ordinancekeepor for every Group.

      The Compact of an Organization consists of either or both of the
      following elements:
d5285 2
a5286 9
         i) Statutes; defined as that collective text which is legally
            binding under the Rules, and must be obeyed by Players
            within the Compact's Jurisdiction as if it was a part of
            the Ruleset.

        ii) Warranties; defined as that collective text which requires
            Players within the Compact's Jurisdiction to either obey
            it or suffer penalties defined within the Rules or the
            Compact.

CFJ 830, Nov. 16 1995: Rule 1529 should be interpreted as granting
Statutes the power to legally bind Players within the Jurisdiction of
the Compact with which the Statutes are associated.

      The Organization is created and is in force once the Notary
      receives the above information from all required Foundors.
a5420 13
      The set of required Foundors is specified within the Rules
      defining the particular Class of Organization, but they must be
      from within the Jurisdiction of the new Organization's Compact.
      Additional restrictions on the set of Foundors can be made by
      those Rules.

      This Rule defers when other Rules specifically claim precedence
      over its requirements. Otherwise, these requirements take
      precedence.

[The Appeals Court ruled in CFJ 820 that an Organization not
belonging to a specifically defined Class could not be formed.]

a6102 36
      A Bearerbond is a Nomic Entity which obeys all the rules
      for a Contract, except:

        In the statement of the Bearerbond, one or more of the parties
        are identified only by unique abstract Role names (such as
        Bearer, or Party of the First Part and Party of the Second
        Part, or Feduciacrator, Honker, and Trusiast, or whatever),
        rather than being identified as a specific Player.  At all
        times, exactly one Player is associated with each Role; the
        Player associated with a particular Role is known as the
        Rolebearer for that Role in that Bearerbond.

        All the copies of the Bearerbond sent and received during
        the setting up of the Bearerbond shall be accompanied by a
        statement clearly identifying the initial Rolebearer for each
        Role in the Bearerbond.  All these statements must be
        identical.

        To change the Rolebearer for some Role in a Bearerbond, the
        current Rolebearer and the new Rolebearer notify the Notary
        of the transaction, clearly indicating which Role in which
        Bearerbond is involved (the notary may assign identifying
        names to Bearerbonds, or otherwise impose identification
        mechanisms as e sees fit).  Unless the Bearerbond specifies
        otherwise, the Rolebearer for any Role may be changed in this
        way at any time.  When any Rolebearer in a Bearerbond changes,
        the Notary shall notify all parties to the Bearerbond of the
        fact of the change, the Role involved, and the identity of the
        new Bearer.  The change of Rolebearer takes effect when the
        Notary sends this notification.

        All Rolebearers in a Bearerbond are in all ways parties to the
        Bearerbond.  When the Rolebearer for some Role in a Bearerbond
        changes, the previous Rolebearer is no longer a party to the
        Bearerbond, unless e is explicitly named in the Bearerbond
        itself, or is the Rolebearer for some other Role in it.

Group Ordinances Must Be Provided upon Request

      An Organization is Public unless the Rules defining its Class

      Administrator of that Organization to any Player As Soon As
      Possible on demand. If, between the time of the demand and the
      time the Administrator fulfills the demand, the Compact has
      changed, the Administrator must provide the Compact as it
      existed at the time of the demand, and must additionally
      document every change made to the Compact between the demand and
      its fulfillment.

Rule 1474/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Coins

      An Organization is permitted to be the Mintor of a Currency
      _only_ if that Organization possesses a Treasury, _and_ if the
      Rules defining that Organization's Class specifically permit it
      to become the Mintor of a Currency.

      Each Rule that permits an Organization of a specific Class to be
      a Mintor must define a unique generic name for every type of
      Currency associated with that Class of Organization.

      The name of any Currency associated with a specific Organization
      shall be the Name of the Organization followed by the unique
      generic name defined by the Class of that Organization.

      The Recordkeepor of any Organization's Currency is the Executor
      of the associated Organization.  The MUQ of all such Currencies
      is 1.

Rule 1397/2 (Mutable, MI=1)
Dissolution of Groups

      An Organization ceases to exist when any of the following
      conditions become true:

        i) Its Compact ceases to have Jurisdiction over any Players
           and no provision exists for the Jurisdiction to expand.
       ii) The continued existence of the Organization would result in
           the absence of a Administrator (and/or the absence of an
           Executor in the case of a Orginization with Treasuries)
           with no provision for any Player to fulfill the role(s).
      iii) The Organization is required to dissolve in accordance with
           its Compact or the Rules.

      At the moment an Organization dissolves, the following occurs,
      in order.

        i) Any Currencies remaining in the Organization's Treasuries
           (if such exist) are distributed as provided for by other
           Rules.

           Organization's Compact.
      iii) The Organization's Treasuries, Compact, and the
           Organization itself, cease to exist.

      Whenever a Public Organization dissolves, the Notary shall
      report that event to the Public Forum As Soon As Possible after
      e is notified as required by other Rules.

      Other Rules may define additional causes of dissolution.

Rule 1459/3 (Mutable, MI=1)
Confidentiality of Contracts

      An Organization can only be Private if the Rules defining its
      Class permit (or require) it to be Private.

      If its Class permits Privacy, but does not require it, an
      Organization is not Private unless its Compact claims Privacy.

      Any Organization which is not a Private Organization is a
      Public Organization.

      The Compact of a Private Organization are privileged, and may
      only be divulged by Players within the Compact's Jurisdiction.
      (This defers to the Compact where it forbids such disclosure.)

      The following are the only legal exceptions:

        i) Disclosure of any part of the Compact to a Player
           within its Jurisdiction.
       ii) Disclosure of any part of the Compact to the current
           Notary.
      iii) Disclosure of any part of the Compact to a Judge or
           Justice judging a CFJ, where the Caller of the CFJ is a
           Player within the Compact's Jurisdiction, and the evidence
           provided by the Caller of the CFJ contains text purported
           to be part or all of the Compact.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would require any
      Player to provide the Compact of a Private Organization upon
      request.

Rule 1457/2 (Mutable, MI=1)
Breach of Contract: Judicial Procedure

      When any Player within the Jurisdiction of a Compact believes
      the Compact to have been Violated by another Player, e shall
      inform the Administrator of that Compact's Organization of that
      belief, along with the nature of the Violation, the Violated
      text of the Compact, and the identity of the Violating Player.
      The Administrator shall then, As Soon As Possible, distribute
      this information to all Players within the Jurisdiction of the
      Violated Compact.

      If, within seven days of this distribution, no Player within the
      Compact's Jurisdiction disputes the claim, the Administrator
      shall declare the Compact Violated.  The Administrator is then
      allowed to initiate any corrections and penalties allowed by the
      Rules and eir Organization's Compact.

      If, however, any Player under the Compact's Jurisdiction
      disputes the claim of Violation within seven days, then any
      Player within the Compact's Jurisdiction may submit a Call for
      Judgement, alleging that a specific Player has Violated the
      Compact. Such a Call for Judgement cannot be made in any other
      circumstance.

      All Players within the Compact's Jurisdiction are automatically
      ineligible to Judge such a CFJ.

      In the event that such a CFJ is found TRUE, the Compact has
      been Violated and the Compact's Administrator shall perform the
      same duties as when no Player contests the claim.  In the event
      that such a CFJ is found FALSE, the Player which called the CFJ
      shall lose 5 Marks to the Bank; this transfer shall be detected
      and reported by the Administrator of the Compact's Organization,
      if the Organization does not possess a Treasury, by its Executor
      otherwise.

The Powers Lottery

      As soon as possible after the beginning of each Nomic Week in

      Assessor shall conduct a Powers Lottery, as set out below, and
      announce the results of the Lottery in the Public Forum.  
a4283 16
      The Powers Lottery is conducted as follows: the Assessor
      randomly chooses one Card which is held by the Bank to be the
      prize of that week's Lottery. The Assessor also randomly
      chooses an Active Player to be winner of the week's Lottery.
      The chosen Card is transferred to the winner of the week's
      Lottery.

      If the Card chosen to be the prize is a Card of the Power of
      Influence, then the Card counts as a 3-vote Power of Influence
      Card. This Rule takes precedence over Rules which describe
      other ways of determining the influence granted by a Card of
      the Power of Influence.

Contests

      A contest is a subgame of Agora Nomic, having its own Name,
      Entry Fee, Regulations, Contestmaster, and Contest Fund.

      It is created when a Player posts to the Public Forum an
      announcement of the contest, including the Name and Regulations.
      Participants in the subgame are called Contestants of that
      contest.  The player making the post becomes the Contestmaster.

      The Contestmaster for a given Contest is a Player who has
      responsibility for administering the subgame.  He reports all
      currency transfers taking place under the Regulations, is the
      Executor of the Contest Fund, and maintains the Regulations.

      The Contest Fund is a Treasury, as provided for in other Rules.
      The owner of this Treasury is the Contest, and the Executor of
      this Treasury is, at all times, the Contestmaster of the
      Contest.

      The Regulations specify the operation of the Contest.  All
      Contestants, and the Contestmaster, are bound by the Regulations
      except where these conflict with the Rules.  They may also
      specify:
        1. how a Contestmaster is replaced. However, no person may
           become Contestmaster without eir consent;
        2. how the Currencies in the Contest Fund shall be spent, so
           long as this does not conflict with the Rules;
        3. the amount of the Entry Fee for the Contest, in the form of
           units of one or more Currency;
        4. additional restrictions on Players to become Contestants, 
           and conditions under which Contestants cease to be
           Contestants;
        5. how the Regulations may be changed.  If they do not so 
           specify, the Regulations may not be changed. Whenever the 
           Regulations are changed, the Contestmaster must post the 
           new Regulations to the Public Forum, and no such change is
           effective until it is so posted;
        and
        6. how the Contest may be dissolved.

      A Player becomes a Contestant by notifying the Contestmaster and
      paying the prescribed Entry Fee to the Contest Fund.  A
      Contestant may quit a Contest at any time by so notifying the
      Contestmaster, or by so posting to the Public Forum.  A
      Contestmaster may resign at any time by posting a message to
      that effect to the Public Forum, at which time e ceases to be
      Contestmaster.

      A contest is dissolved when there is no Contestmaster and no
      provision for replacing em, or upon unanimous agreement of the
      Contestmaster and all Contestants, or as otherwise provided in
      the rules, or in the Regulations.  When this happens the Contest
      Fund is distributed as provided in the Regulations; if no
      provision is made the Fund is divided equally between the
      Contestants. 

      No Blots shall be assigned by this Rule.

Rule 766/2 (Mutable, MI=1)
d5384 1
a5384 33
      A Group is initially formed by a set of Players which has
      registered with the Registrar to form a Group; other Players may
      join later.  Each Group has a Name, a Membership, a Vizier,
      an Ordinancekeepor, a Treasury, an Initial Set of Ordinances,
      and an associated form of Currency, called the <name> Coins,
      where <name> is the Name of the Group.

      1.  The Name may not be the Name of another Group.

      2.  The Membership is a set of Players;  these Players are
      Members of the Group, and all other Players are not.

      3.  Synchronously with the registration of a Group, two
      positions are created known as the <name> Vizier and the <name>
      Ordinancekeepor, where <name> is the Name of the Group. These
      positions are not Offices, and they may only be held by members
      of the Group. These positions may never be vacant while the
      Group remains in existence.

      The Vizier shall inform the Registrar whenever the Membership
      of the Group or the Ordinancekeepor of the Group changes. When
      the Vizier of the Group changes, the new Vizier shall inform
      the Registrar of the change.

      The Ordinancekeepor shall keep an accurate and up to date
      record of the current Ordinances of the Group.

      4.  The Treasury is a repository for Points and Currencies and
      has the same capabilities for holding, trading, and spending
      Points and Currencies as does a Player.

      5.  The Ordinances are a description of the operation of the
      Group.

      Application) containing a list of the set X of Players, all of
      whom must be unaffiliated with any other Group; and a name for
      the proposed Group.

      When the Registrar receives Applications from three Players in
      X, having identical information (as described above), all within
      a week of each other, then the Group shall be registered with
      the given Name, and the three Players who sent Applications as
      Members of that Group. The Registrar shall then post in the
      Public Forum that the Group has been formed, aslong with its
      Name, Membership, and the name of the Vizier and
      Ordinancekeepor.

      agreement of all Members of that Group.

      2.  the Vizier of the Group, so long as the Vizier is a Member
      of that Group.  If the Ordinances of a Group do not so specify,

      be spent, so long as it does not conflict with the Rules.  A
      Group may spend Points or Currencies in the same manner as a
      Player.  When Points or Currencies are to be spent from the
      Group's Treasury, the Vizier of that Group shall inform the
      Scorekeepor or Recordkeepor for the Currency, as is appropriate.

      5.  How the Members of the Group shall determine the manner
      in which the Group shall cast its Group votes. If the 
      Ordinances do not so specify, the Group is prohibited from
      casting Group votes. The Group is also prohibited from casting
      any votes on a Proposal if it was not in existence at the
      beginning of the Voting Period of that Proposal, or if it has
      less than three Members. The Group's Vizier is responsible for
      informing the Assessor of how the Group votes on a Proposal.

Contracts
  This Category includes Rules defining and regulating
  Contracts and the Office of the Notary.
----------------------------------------

Rule 1455/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Contracts

      A Contract is a Nomic Entity which has the legal force to
      require one or more Players to perform any action, or
      face penalties for Breach of Contract.

      Only Players may be parties to a Contract.

      A Contract must specify the identities of all Players who
      are parties of the Contract.  A Contract may also specify any or
      all of the following:

      * How the Contract may be changed; if this is not specified, the
        Contract may not be changed after it has been enacted.
      * How the Contract may be dissolved; if this is not specified,
        the Contract may only be dissolved as specified in the Rules.
      * How additional parties may be joined to the Contract after it
        has been enacted; if this is not specified, additional parties
        may not be added to the Contract after it has been enacted.
      * How a party to the Contract may be released from the Contract;
        if this is not specified, no party of the Contract may be
        released from the Contract while the Contract continues to
        exist.
      * What actions the parties to the contract are required to
        perform, or are prohibited from performing, and under what
        conditions these requirements or prohibitions have force.
      * What penalties are imposed upon a party who breaches the
        Contract.

      A new Contract is entered into only when the Notary has received
      identical copies of the Contract from every party named in the
      Contract.  The Notary shall send a notification to all parties
      of a contract as soon as possible after it has been legally
      entered into.  The Contract shall be in force no sooner than the
      moment of that notification.  

      A Contract ceases to have force at the moment it is dissolved in
      accordance with its own terms, or one or more of the parties of
      the Contract ceases to to be a Player, or the Contract is
      breached as described elsewhere.

      Whenever a Contract is changed in any way (including the
      addition of new parties to, or release of existing parties
      from), some party of the Contract must notify the Notary of the
      change as soon as possible after it occurs.  In the case of a
      party being added to Contract, the change only has effect if
      that new party sends the notification to the Notary.  The
      Notary shall forward this notification of change to all parties
      (including new parties and former parties, if appropriate) of
      the Contract as soon as possible thereafter.

      No Contract may be interpreted in such a way as to have any
      legal force on a Player who is not a party of the contract, or
      such that it requires a Player to be joined as a Party of the
      Contract.  No term of a Contract may have retroactive effect.

Rule 1459/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Confidentiality of Contracts

      A Player who is or has been Notary may not divulge any part of
      any Contract which was entered into or was in force during the
      time that e is or was Notary.  However, the following
      disclosures are legal, as noted:

      * Disclosure of part or all of a Contract, to any party of that
        Contract;
      * Disclosure of part or all of any Contract, to the current
        Notary;
      * Disclosure of part or all of any Contract, to a Judge or
        Justice judging a CFJ, where the Caller of the CFJ is a
        party to the Contract, and the evidence provided by the
        Caller of the CFJ contains text purported to be part
        or all of the Contract.

      If a Judge or Justice requires disclosure of a Contract to em
      for the purpose of Judging a CFJ, the Notary is required to
      provide a copy of the Contract to the Judge or Justice as soon
      as possible after the Judge's or Justice's request.  The Judge
      or Justice receiving the contract is then bound by the same
      strictures of nondisclosure as is the Notary, and is further
      prohibited from attaching a copy of it to eir Judgement as
      evidence.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would require the
      Notary to provide such records upon request, and which would
      require a Judge to include a copy of a Contract as part of the
      evidence justifying eir Ruling.

      In addition, this Rule shall never be construed such that a
      Player may not disclose part of all of any Contract of which e
      is a party.

Rule 1456/2 (Mutable, MI=1)
Breach of Contract: Definition and Penalties

      All parties to a Contract must abide by all terms of the
      Contract at all times, or suffer the penalties for breach of
      Contract.

      A Contract is breached if any party to the Contract fails, due
      to neglect, inability, or unwillingness, to perform any action
      required of em by the Contract, or performs, voluntarily or
      involuntarily, any action prohibited of em by the Contract.  In
      the event that a party would be required to violate the Rules in
      any way in order to uphold a Contract, the party is required to
      breach the Contract.

      The following shall take place in the event that a party of a
      Contract breaches that contract:

      * 20 Marks shall be immediately transferred from the breaching
        Player to the Bank.
      * The breaching Player shall gain 3 Blots.
      * 30 Marks shall be divided as evenly as possible and
        transferred from the breaching Player to each of the other
        parties of the Contract.

      A Contract may specify additional penalties which are to be
      imposed in the event of a breach; however, such penalties shall
      be limited to the mandatory transfer of Points or Currencies
      from the party who breached the Contract to any or all of the
      other parties of the contract.

      The Notary shall be responsible for reporting all Score,
      Currency, and Blot changes which arise as a result of this Rule.
      All Point Penalties herein are non-punitive.      

      In the event of a breach, the Notary shall have the authority to
      order those Point and Currency forfeitures and transfers which
      are required by the Rules pertaining to Contracts and by the
      Contract which has been breached.  This authority is limited to
      ordering the forfeiture of Points possessed by the party in
      breach and the transfer of Points or Currencies from the party
      in breach to any or all of the other parties of the Contract,
      but only to the extent permitted by the Rules pertaining to
      Contracts and by the Contract which has been breached.

----------------------------------------

Rule 1457/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Breach of Contract: Judicial Procedure

      When any party to a Contract believes the Contract has been
      breached, that party shall inform the Notary that e believes the
      Contract has been breached, specifying which party e believes
      breached the Contract.  The Notary shall then, as soon as
      possible, distribute this notice to all parties of the Contract.
      If, within seven days of this distribution, no party of the
      Contract disputes the claim of breach, the Notary shall declare
      the Contract breached, and order any and all forfeitures and
      transfers of Points and Currencies that may be required by the
      Rules or the Contract in the event of a breach.

      If, however, any party disputes the claim of breach within seven
      days, then any party of the Contract in dispute may submit a
      Call for Judgement, alleging that a specific party of the
      Contract has breached the Contract.  No Player who is not a
      party of the Contract in question may make such a Call for
      Judgement, nor may such a Call for Judgement be made in any
      other circumstance.  All Players who are parties to the Contract
      are automatically ineligible to Judge such a CFJ.

      In the event that such a CFJ is found TRUE, the Contract is
      breached, and the Notary shall perform the same duties as when
      no party contests the claim.  In the event that such a CFJ is
      found FALSE, the Player which called the CFJ shall lose 5 Marks;
      this transfer shall be detected and reported by the Notary.

Rule 1499/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Bearerbonds

      A Bearerbond is a Nomic Entity which obeys all the rules
      for a Contract, except:

        In the statement of the Bearerbond, one or more of the parties
        are identified only by unique abstract Role names (such as
        Bearer, or Party of the First Part and Party of the Second
        Part, or Feduciacrator, Honker, and Trusiast, or whatever),
        rather than being identified as a specific Player.  At all
        times, exactly one Player is associated with each Role; the
        Player associated with a particular Role is known as the
        Rolebearer for that Role in that Bearerbond.

        All the copies of the Bearerbond sent and received during
        the setting up of the Bearerbond shall be accompanied by a
        statement clearly identifying the initial Rolebearer for each
        Role in the Bearerbond.  All these statements must be
        identical.

        To change the Rolebearer for some Role in a Bearerbond, the
        current Rolebearer and the new Rolebearer notify the Notary
        of the transaction, clearly indicating which Role in which
        Bearerbond is involved (the notary may assign identifying
        names to Bearerbonds, or otherwise impose identification
        mechanisms as e sees fit).  Unless the Bearerbond specifies
        otherwise, the Rolebearer for any Role may be changed in this
        way at any time.  When any Rolebearer in a Bearerbond changes,
        the Notary shall notify all parties to the Bearerbond of the
        fact of the change, the Role invovled, and the identity of the
        new Bearer.  The change of Rolebearer takes effect when the
        Notary sends this notification.

        All Rolebearers in a Bearerbond are in all ways parties to the
        Bearerbond.  When the Rolebearer for some Role in a Bearerbond
        changes, the previous Rolebearer is no longer a party to the
        Bearerbond, unless e is explicitly named in the Bearerbond
        itself, or is the Rolebearer for some other Role in it.

      of the Ruleset, to maintain a list of Judgements and their case
      histories, and to maintain a list of game Winners in past games.
      The Archivist is free to comment on the historical records as
      they see fit, but such commentary must be clearly delimited
      from the historical material. Where the material being stored
      does not already admit a classification method, the Archivist

Point Transfers Not from the Bank

      be limited to the largest amount such that the Treasury of the
      Player receiving the transfer will not contain more than 90% of
      the Points which that Player would need in order to win.  Any
      portion of a transfer which would violate this requirement is
      cancelled and does not take place.

      Transfers of Points from the Bank are never restricted in this
      manner.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would permit
      transfers or portions of transfers forbidden by this Rule to
      take place.

Notes: 1) Once again, this Ruleset is contingent on Proposal 1694 having
failed.  2) I have placed Rule 1515, "Contest Regulations May Require
Some Currency Transfers," in the "Groups" Category, in the anticipation
that this will be renamed to "Groups and Contests" and the general
Contests Rule placed into that category in the near future.

      An Aristocrat has a Default Vote and a Name.  Each Aristocrat 
      will Vote once on each proposal.  Unless the Aristocrat is
      Influenced in a manner defined by these rules, that Vote
      will be the Default Vote.  The Assessor keeps track of
      Aristocrat Votes, and those Votes are publishes in 
      eir report(s) along with Player Votes.

      The number of Aristocrats is added to the number of
      Active Players for the purposes of determining Quorom.

      The owner of a given Treasury is permitted to, at any time,
      transfer any or all of the units of Currency within that
      Treasury to any other Treasury, so long as this transfer is
      permitted by the Rules.  Such a transfer is known as a
      "voluntary" transfer.

      Transfers which are indirectly required by the Rules--that is,
      required only because they are required by a non-Rule entity
      which is required by the Rules to be obeyed (including, but not
      necessarily limited to Group Ordinances and Contest
      Regulations)--are also "voluntary" transfers.

      Voluntary transfers are restricted to positive quantities, and
      in no case may more of a given Currency be transferred from a
      Treasury than that Treasury possessed prior to the transfer.
      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which attempts to
      transfer more than that amount in a voluntary transfer.

      The Recordkeepor of a Currency must be notified as soon as
      possible by the owner of the Treasury from which a
      voluntary transfer is made.  If a voluntary transfer is not
      reported to the Recordkeepor within seven days, it is cancelled
      and does not take place.

      Transfers which are not voluntary transfers ("involuntary"
      transfers) shall only be made as directly required by the
      Rules.  Such transfers must be reported to the Recordkeepors of
      the Currencies involved as soon as possible thereafter, by a
      Player specified by the Rules.  Involuntary transfers are
      permitted to be of any amount (limited only by MUQ rounding),
      and are permitted to involve amounts greater than the amount in
      the Treasury from which the transfer originates.

      If an involuntary transfer is not reported to the Recordkeepor
      within seven days, or there is no Rule which requires a Player
      to report the involuntary transfer, the transfer is cancelled
      and does not take place.

      All transfers take effect no sooner than the time the
      Recordkeepor of the Currency is informed of the transfer.
d3751 1
a3770 57
Rule 937/6 (Mutable, MI=1)
Who's Responsible for Currency Changes

      The following classes of involuntary transfers of Currencies
      shall be detected by the Player specified below, within the time
      limit specified, if any.

      * Transfers resulting from the payment of fixed weekly Salaries:
        the Scorekeepor;

      * Transfers resulting from the End of a Game: the Scorekeepor;

      * Transfers resulting from the registration of a new Player or
        the deregistration of an existing Player: the Scorekeepor;

      * Transfers resulting from the dissolution of a Group: the
        Scorekeepor;

      * Transfers resulting from the change of Speakership: the
        Scorekeepor;

      * Transfers resulting from the submission of Proposals: the
        Promoter, not later than the message which distributes the
        Proposals;

      * Transfers resulting from Voting upon Proposals: the Assessor,
        not later the message announcing the Voting Results;

      * Transfers resulting from the assignment fees, salaries, or
        penalties to Judges or Justices: The Clerk of the Courts, not
        later than the message which announces the event which caused
        the mandated Transfer;

      * Transfers resulting from penalties or bonus imposed by the
        Rules, when the Rules do not specify another Player to make
        the report: the first Player to detect and report the
        conditions which cause the Transfer to be mandated.

      Other Rules may specify the party required to report a class of
      involuntary transfer not specified in this Rule.

      The specified Player shall report the transfer in question to
      the appropriate Recordkeepors.  All transfers must be reported
      at least as soon as possible; if a sooner time is specified,
      that time takes precedence.

Rule 1489/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
The Potato is Transferred

      Any Player who does not possess the Potato can spend five points
      to transfer the Potato to any Player who can legally own the
      Potato.  (This can even be to the transferring Player, provided
      e may possess the Potato.)  Each Player is limited to one such
      transfer every week.

      The transfer is made when the transferring Player posts a
      message in the Public Forum, reporting to the Assessor which
      Player the Potato is being transferred to. If the Player being
      transferred to is eligible to possess the Potato, and the
      transferring Player possesses at least five points, the transfer
      is made and the Assessor reports the transferring Player's score
      change to the Scorekeepor.  The five points go to the Bank.

           Proposals are up for vote.)

in the Ruleset i just posted, i misstated the number of current Rules.
there are actually 192 Rules, not 186.  the breakdown by MI is
correct.

i won't repost the Ruleset because this information is not required by
the Rules, and reposting the Ruleset to correct this information would
be a massive waste of bandwidth.

The Order of Machiavelli

      There is a Patent Title known as the Order of Machiavelli. The
      Title is awarded to a Player when a Directive to award the
      Title to that Player is adopted. Any such Directive has an
      Adoption Index of 2.  A Player ceases to hold the Title when a
      Directive to remove the Title from that Player is adopted. Any
      such Directive has an Adoption Index of 1.

      When a Player holds the Title of the Order of Machiavelli, e is
      entitled to cast a third vote on a Proposal. E does this by
      casting two Extra Votes on the Proposal.

History:
Created by Proposal 1566, Apr. 28 1995

Index greater than 1, has a Adoption Index of 1.
