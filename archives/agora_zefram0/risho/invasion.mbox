I think "divine right" is a bit too much. I don't think we should offend
anyone's religious feelings.

Hmmmm. Up from the original 11. Do we actually have 13 Agora players

Ah, yes. I love that tactic. Of course, in that event, *we* can always get

I assume that second sentence is designed to prevent them from amending it,
but the last bit is somewhat ambiguous; I'd just end it with "...by any
means other than those described in this Rule."

Proposal 336
Varuna

I propose a rule called "Power vote" :

 A player may use his own points to buy himself a second vote.
 This vote costs a random number of points from 4-12.
 The vote may be in favor or against the proposal, both votes don't have
 to be similar.
 Only one vote per proposal may be bought.
 The second vote is assumed as a "phantom player"s vote and not his own.


If we are going to use this, we'll have to stick around for some time
before going into action: At least one of our infiltrators should have
12 or more points.

Apart from the religious objection by Oerjan (I would prefer 'natural'
right to 'platonic' right - platonic), I also have the feeling we should
not put ourselves in the role of "one true master of all nomics". We're
of course the one true master of Rishon, but I wouldn't like to say this
of some other nomics. We are superior, at least in some aspects (mostly
through our higher age) but being 'the master' is really exaggerating,
in my opinion

Good one.  "Natural right" (suggested by Andre) sounds too weak.

That was calculated for six players, wasn't it?  The web page (URL

Indeed, I was considering that.  I can rustle up one or two mercenaries.
Risho's going to be a big nomic by the time our entire assault squad
has infiltrated it.

I don't think it's ambiguous.  Remember, the wording has to be
exceptionally tight; if they can detect any possible loophole they are
liable to Judge that they can exploit it.  With your wording (which
I did consider), the loophole is that the mention of repeal might be
interpreted as sufficient to count as "described in this Rule", making
that provision ineffective.  As I worded it, I think it's absolutely
unambiguous: this Rule can't be modified unless this Rule *requires* it
to be.  Do you see a loophole?

C-in-C Harlequin, perhaps you'd like to start posting progress reports
and infiltration timetables?

Do they allow point transfers?  If the power vote passes, we really
want to use it as quickly as possible, just to stop any of the defence
using it.  Of course, there's a significant chance that the Speaker
will use it immediately after distributing the proposal, so we should
probably budget under the assumption that that will happen.

"natural" sounds weak.  What is your objection to "Platonic"?

But we're *not* putting ourselves in that position.  It'll only apply
to Risho, just like its "one true nomic" rule.  Think of it as a change
in Risho's official opinion of nomics.

Ooooh, deliciously poor wording. Is that one total or one per player?

Well, the tentative date for action is still June 1, which gives us quite a
while. I intend to speed that up, once circumstances seem to warrant it, but
for the moment I suggest we allow space to become acquainted with enemy
territory and become well-integrated to the host culture.

At least eight, since a brand-new non-Agoran just registered. I'm asking Uri
to send me an updated player's list; I'll post as soon as I have it. So
we'll require

Participating *in the invasion.* Which reminds me: all Players who are

Heh. If bringing in mercenary squads is as easy as I think it will be (i.e.
they send one e-mail saying, "Hi, I register as XXXX, I vote FOR this" and a
week later one saying "I deregister") I can guarantee you at least four or
five myself.

Ahhhh. Good point. Assuming they use a reasonable definition of "require" it
sounds fine.

Coming up. Also, I'd like to ask General Chaos why he has only registered as
an Observer in Rishonomic.

It says "one vote per proposal".  I read that as one in total per
proposal.  We should get this clarified; maybe even through a Risho CFJ.

I don't recommend that strategy.  We should attempt to disguise our
numbers as long as possible; having a dozen people do what you describe
would make it obvious to them that they are in trouble, and motivate
them to recruit their own mercenaries.  If, however, all they see is one
maverick player submitting and voting for this ridiculous proposal, and
twenty other players publically disapproving of it, they won't see the
danger until it's too late.

Of course, blatant mercenaries can be used within the final ten minutes
of the voting period without a problem.

I'm not comfortable with this washing boots with tongue business.
The tone I'd like to strike is lofty and imperious (so 'one true
master' and 'almighty Agora in its infinite wisdom' are both fine)
without being overtly sadistic.

Agreed. I also think that we should follow Chuck's suggestion, and make 
Agora Overlord and Protector of Risho.

I'm not too keen on the boot-washing bit either.

So say "this Nomic"; or stipulate that the Rule amends itself if the

The invading Rule should therefore prohibit rule renumbering.

Rule numbers currently change to match the number of the last proposal to
amend the rule.  There's been at least one or two attempts to strike that
clause, and in fact one of the proposals I just submitted to them includes
replacing it (with "new rules take their number from the proposal that
creates them").

OTOH, if rule number changes *are* allowed, we could have the Monument Rule
change its own number to 0.  Let's see how willing they are to get rid of it
with a Rule -1.  (The protoed Monument Rule specifically disallows changes
to *its* rule number)

And for that matter, we could also toss them one of our suggested precedence
conflicts - a set of rules similar to their existing precedence rules, which
would (according to the EPRs) take precedence over the EPRs, but stating
exactly the opposite of the EPRs.  Given how much fun they're having with
their flawed definition of "Gnome Buddy", they should just love *that* one.

You also need to state that no other Rule may be renumbered such that
it has a lesser number than this Rule.

No we don't.  108 and 210 are both Mutable, and therefore claim to have
lower precedence than the monument rule.  The monument rule therefore has
the authority to determine its own precedence relationships, and indeed
it claims to take precedence over all other rules, regardless of number.

Of course, they could make 210 Immutable, but they could equally
well enact another rule that claims that *higher* numbered rules take
precedence.  In either case there would be a conflict that can't be
resolved within the rules.  There is no way we can make it impossible
to engineer such a situation.

Suggestion: make the Monument Rule neither mutable nor immutable, but
rather of a class of its own defining which takes precedence over
both. :)

There's no real difference between that and "this rule takes precedence
over all other rules".
