  Concurring Opinion appended, as of this message

======================================================================

Arguments: of eir own admission, Assessor Kelly lost some of eir mail 
during the Voting Period on Proposals 2555-2564, which e notified to 
the Public Forum. It appears that one message from Player Jtael, 
containing Votes on these Proposals, was sent to the Assessor, 
presumably posterior to this event (since the Assessor did receive 
that mail), and possibly as a reply to the Assessor's request that 
Players resend their Votes. These Votes, however, were received 
posterior to the close of the Voting Period on these Proposals, which 
followed the Assessor's message by a few hours.

However, Player Jtael has indicated that this message was eir 
*second* posting of Votes on these Proposals; the balance of the 
evidence is therefore in favor of the notion that Jtael's Votes were 
probably sent during the Voting Period, received at the Assessor's 
end and deleted in the event to which the Assessor alluded.

I don't, however, claim any knowledge of this, or know of a means to 
determine it with certainty; I can only contribute circumstantial 
evidence. I leave it to the Judge to determine whether, in the words 
of Rule 1575, "the preponderance of the evidence at hand" is 
consistent with the Statement.

There remains the question of the legal significance of mail received 
at a Player's computer but lost, or unread, during the period when it 
has legal significance; I feel there are strong reasons related in 
particular to "the best interests of the Game" to believe that this 
shall be resolved to support the notion that if the preceding 
outline of event corresponds to reality, then this Statement is TRUE. 
However I wish to make my reasons clear in a separate CFJ, since the 
issue has bearing on matters beyond this Statement.

for reasons that are not entirely clear to me, i have lost some of my

in the last two or three days, resend them now, just to be sure.

Arrgh!

This is extremely frustrating; I've sent my votes on these proposals
to the Assessor, twice.

your votes were not received by the Assessor during the Voting Period.

setting aside the ludicry of "+4000" as a time zone, the VP on 2555 to
2564 ended 31 Mar 1996 17:26:02 UTC, or about 11 hours before you sent
your Votes.  therefore, they don't count.  sorry.

======================================================================
Decision of Judge Oerjan:  TRUE

I judge TRUE.

I find that this statement hinges on when a message can be said to
have been received by the recipient, in the case when this is a
person.

One possibility is to say that a message is received when the recipient
reads the message. This is highly dangerous however, as it is often easy
for the recipient to set up automatic filters, which could prevent em from
seeing unwanted messages at all; furthermore, and perhaps more important
in a trust-based forum like Agora, this could lead to unacceptable delays
between the sending and receipt of a message.  I would therefore prefer,
if possible, an interpretation which avoids this possibility.

I therefore instead choose to interpret the time of receipt to be when
the message enters the recipient's normal technical domain of control,
whether this be eir private machine or eir private account on a shared
machine (but not the shared machine itself, if the recipient does not
control it.)

>From Kelly's explanations, I understand that the loss of messages must
have happened after the messages were transfered to her private
machine. I therefore judge that she received these messages.

Greetings,
Oerjan.

Subject: BUS: Verified Declaration of the Assessor

I, KELLY MARTIN, declare as follows:

  I.  I am presently, and have been continuously since March 15th,
      1996, a Player of Agora Nomic, and the duly elected Assessor of
      the same.

 II.  At no time, during the Voting Periods of the Proposals numbered
      2555 through 2564, did I, while acting in my official capacity of
      Assessor of Agora Nomic, receive a message from the Player Jtael,
      which purported to indicate the manner in which the aforementioned
      Player intended to Vote upon those Proposals.  I did receive
      such a message from Jtael, but not until after the Voting
      Periods in question had ceased.

III.  My computer, which receives and stores electronic mail addressed
      to me for my perusal, experienced a software failure on or about
      March 28th, resulting in the loss of several pieces of
      electronic mail.  I have no knowledge as to whether a message
      from Jtael, of any sort, may have been included in the messages
      thus lost.

 IV.  I have no interest in attempting to deprive Jtael of his right
      to vote.  I had no knowledge of the anticipated outcomes of any
      of the Proposals in question, not having reviewed any of the
      votes received until after the Voting Periods had ended.  The
      determination to discount Jtael's Votes was made by software
      written by myself, based on the date entered into the voting
      datafile by myself at the time I received and processed Jtael's
      message.  I was not aware at that time that Jtael's Votes could
      not be counted.

I affirm under penalty of perjury that the above statements and
representations are true.

the software i use to read mail failed (memory management error) while
reading in new mail, corrupting my entire mail buffer.  as a
consequence, i lost some previously read mail, and some as-of-yet
unread mail.

i sometimes, but not always, skim my mail spool file (using a file
pager) before bringing it in to my mail reader.

further data loss were caused by a power failure, which resulted in
the loss of some files which had been modified but not yet saved.  i
don't know if this cost me any email; it was the reason why Murphy's
Votes (which i had received and processed) disappeared.

    Miss Manners has come to believe that the basic political division in
      the society is not between liberals and conservatives, but between
      those who believe that they should have a say in the love lives of
     strangers, and those who do not.  -- "Miss Manners" (Judith Martin).

======================================================================
Concurring Opinion

Sponsors:  Chuck
           Kelly

We applaud Judge Oerjan's interpretation of when a message
is "received."  Though the term is frequently used in the
Rules, it is never clearly defined, and recent discussion
of the issue demonstrates that a poor (but at first glance
adequate) definition of the term may have serious deleterious
effects.  Oerjan's conclusion that a message is received when
it "enters the recipient's normal technical domain of control"
follows Game Custom as well as quite accurately fitting the
commonsense definition of the word.

We are troubled, however, by Oerjan's neglect of an important
issue in this particular case--namely, the lack of any
concrete evidence that Jtael's votes were sent (and received)
during the voting period.  Jtael claims that they were, which
leaves us with three possibilities:

  1.  He did, in fact, send his votes during the prescribed
      voting period.  (There is always the possibility that
      votes sent during the voting period were not received,
      but since Kelly admits that some messages which were
      received were lost, we consider this possibility to be
      negligible.)
  2.  He believes that the votes were sent during the voting
      period, but in fact they were not.
  3.  He is intentionally lying.

Since we are loath to accuse anyone of lying without positive evidence
thereof, we will discount the third case.

This leaves us with two possibilities: either the votes were sent
during the voting period, as Jtael claims, or Jtael mistakenly
believes that he sent his votes during the voting period.  There
is no timestamped message to determine the time at which the
votes were actually sent, so there is no way to determine for
certain which is the case.

It is possible, especially in a Nomic as complex as Agora, for
a Player to be mistaken.  One of us (Chuck) has more than once
sent in votes, believing them to be cast within the voting
period, only to be informed that the votes were late and
thus could not be counted.

Considering Jtael's claim that he did send his votes during the
voting period, we must ultimately conclude that it is more likely
that he did in fact do so than that he is mistaken--we assume that
Jtael is more likely to be correct in his belief than mistaken.
Still, the Judgement of TRUE on this CFJ could have been much more
certain if there had been evidence that the votes were in fact
sent during the voting period, and we are disturbed that Oerjan
did not explicitly address this issue in his Reasons and Arguments.
