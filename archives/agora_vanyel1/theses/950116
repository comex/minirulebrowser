   The game of Nomic works, like any other game, by a consensus of the
Players to follow the Rules set out and agreed upon at the beginning of
the game.  In a game of, for example, Monopoly, Players may agree on a
"house rule"--a variation on the Rules, agreed on by all Players, which
has just as much force of law as anything listed in the rulebook.
   Such a solution could solve many problems that arise in Nomic.  For
example, once the Black Repeals had been Proposed, voted on, and passed,
all the Players (or at least a majority) could have agreed that it was
silly to do so, and break the Rules of Nomic, temporarily, to fix the
problem.  Working outside of the Rules like this is always an option which
is available to Players of Nomic.
   But such a solution goes so completely against the grain of the ideas 
behind Nomic, as proposed by Peter Suber, to make such a solution entirely
undesirable.  The purpose of Nomic is to experiment with Rulemaking, and
Rule modification, within an initial framework.  To deviate from this 
pattern would constantly be remembered, and although play would continue,
the thought lying in the back of everyone's minds would always be "Could
we have solved the problem within the Rules?  Could we have kept the game
intact?"
   For there is the problem with such a `meta-solution'.  For over one and
a half years, Agora Nomic has continued *without a break*.  The Rules have
been followed and the very same game has been continuously played since 
then.  But, if a meta-solution had been employed, the game would not have
been continuous.  It would have had a glaring discontinuity in it, much 
as if the previous game had ended, and all involved had begun a new game
with an initial ruleset bearing a very strong resemblance to the Ruleset
as of just prior to the problem.
   There is a certain satisfaction which Nomic Players can derive from
solving a problem completely within the Rules.  There certainly can be
hangups along the way--sometimes of a month or longer--but even if some
time is lost, the satisfaction is still there of continuing the same
Nomic, problem solved and ready for another.

Ronald responded on A004; I haven't received critique from anyone
else.

Ok.  (Well, I wasn't a Player then either, I just found out about
it through conversation and such.  I'll include an explanation,
though.)

So what are you suggesting?  Just that I drop the Suber reference?

Hmm... well, it seems to me that looking at Agora from an experimental
standpoint, one should attempt if at all possible to continue the
experiment without modification from the outside... I'll put something
to this effect in the paper.

I sent out reminders.  If you still haven't gotten comments in
~5 days, let me know.  My comments on A004 will follow this.

Hmm... yes.  I'll see what I can work out.

You're right, that emphasizes the point much more.

Rrm.  Well, I suppose so.  (grumble) :)
