                       Agora Nomic: Recent History

                        (LATE 1994 TO EARLY 1995)

               By Jeffrey Caruso (elJefe): jlc@triple-i.com

   This has been a fairly lively period; many of the concepts appearing
   above, such as Extra Votes, Contests, Degrees, Blots, etc. have
   appeared during this period. On the other hand, a number of the old
   entities that people had grown used to disappeared, such as Group
   Votes, the Vototron, Marks Interest, Stocks, the Proposal Sweepstakes,
   etc. Life unfolds.
   
   One of the major themes has been the removal of the "Immutable Rule"
   concept from the Ruleset. Now all Rules have "partial mutability",
   with a Mutability Index which defines how much precedence they
   command, and how hard they are to change. Also, Rules are no longer
   renumbered when amended. This is a major change which greatly improves
   the stability of the precedence relationships.
   
   Much of the work of crafting the proposals to achieve this has been
   done by the Reform Group, and not all of it has been without
   controversy. In fact "controversy" would pretty well describe this
   entire period.
   
   Since August, when I started Watching, we've seen several major
   explosions in the Ruleset, and one or two really good scams:
   
   There was the typo in Proposal 1004 which deregistered people after
   inactivity of two DAYS (instead of two weeks, as intended). There was
   the Marks Scam in which the scammer used a loophole in the "Game
   Entities May Not Be Arbitrarily Changed" rule to transfer everyone's
   Marks to emself.
   
   There was the time in October when one player attempted to place
   everyone On Hold retroactively from the beginning of August, in an
   attempt to deregister those players and force their Groups to
   dissolve. This provoked quite a bit of discussion but was eventually
   ruled illegal.
   
   Later, a Group was formed with the purpose of scamming the Coin laws.
   In those days a dissolving group's Coins were automatically redeemed
   at 2 points each. The Millionaires Group was formed very briefly, long
   enough to mint 4,000,000 coins and give them to Timothy. His
   8,000,000+ points were enough to win the Game...
   
   Not all the Rules surprises had to do with deliberate Scams. In
   December, an innocuous CFJ determined that in fact the Kudo Rule was
   defective and did not allow for the transfer of Kudos at all!
   
   Some of our controversies did not directly involve the Ruleset at all.
   In November, the pace of the Reform proposals provoked a reaction in
   the form of an unofficial and secret group, known as "SLOWDOWN!" There
   was a lot of emotional reaction to the fact that this group used
   anonymous mail to broadcast their position, with some Players doubting
   that the group really existed, or contained any Players, and others
   debating the propriety of using anonymous remailers. We even had a
   copycat anon-mailer! Well, it was interesting for a while...
   
   In December the Speaker (who was also Scorekeepor), claimed overwork
   and went On Hold to get rid of the Scorekeeporship. Eventually e
   abandoned eir position as Speaker, and the Scorekeepor position was
   filled part-time by various people before regular reports resumed in
   March.
   
   The period since January has been one of great creativity. After
   wiping the slate clean of non-Player voting entites, both old and new
   Players began floating various ideas for transferrable votes, new ways
   of winning (besides Points), new ways of NOT winning, and reorganizing
   the position of Speaker. We even had a competition to create an Agora
   Anthem!
   
   The Extra Vote rule, one of the first fruits of this effort, had a
   number of loopholes; originally it awarded a Player one EV for each
   proposal on which e ABSTAINed. Sounds reasonable enough, but it
   actually encouraged submitted large numbers of frivolous Proposals to
   give plenty of opportunities for voting ABSTAIN.
   
   Another amusing loophole was that the limit of 5 EV's per player was
   worded in a way that made it ineffective, and one player who
   habitually ABSTAINs on everything managed to get a windfall of 35
   EV's!
   
   A Proposal of my own (Contests) slipped through with even worse
   loopholes. My idea was to allow subgames of Agora whose regulations
   were enforceable in the Nomic Courts. What actually resulted was a
   Frankenstein's monster in which anyone could be nominated as
   Contestmaster of a contest against their will, and subject to its
   rules! And this was not the only problem! Hopefully by the time this
   is published the rewritten Rule will be in place.
   
   This brief review of some of the recent highlights cannot do justice
   to the full range of creativity that players have shown, in trying to
   construct a Nomic Economy, in crafting beautiful theses and outrageous
   scams, and in using the Rules as the raw material for making logical
   pretzels. In hopes that the spirit of friendly one-upmanship and
   logical limit-testing will continue, I conclude: long live Agora!
