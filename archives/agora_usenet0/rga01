And if you're interested in eNomic, well, there's a Game going on already!
Yes, that's right! As the Benevolent, Mighty Speaker of the eNomic Game
(we must refer to the Glorious and Trancendant Speaker with those adjectives
approved in Rule 357), we wish to welcome you, if you would like to play.
To register, simply email ourself at 'wesc@ichips.intel.com' or even at
'wesc@agora.rain.com' now. :) Or both for fastest response. The listsev for
the eNomic Game is at nomic@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au if you would simply like
to watch for a short time before joining. 

If you are interested in simply playing a "live" Game, we are just now
finishing an Initial Rule Set which we believe to be fairly good, and could
use some extra input. If you woule like us to email this to you, please let
us know. Enjoy!

The Omnilaborant and Overworked Speaker
