actually, the "standard" Initial Rules for Nomic include at least a
teeny tiny element of randomness: at the end of eir turn, a player
rolls a six-sided die and receives the number of points shown.

meanwhile, Agora Nomic (the Net's largest known pbem Nomic) hsa this
Rule:

| Rule 1079/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
| Definition of "Random"
| 
|       When a rule requires a random choice, that choice shall be made
|       among all the possible choices with equal probability.
| 
|       Because of the impossibility of finding a truly random test,
|       "equal", for the purposes of the above statement, shall mean
|       "reasonably close to equal".  It is up to common sense to
|       determine what is reasonably close to equal; however, the burden
|       of proof of a method's randomness lies with the Player who used
|       the method.
| 
|       The probability of a Platonic solid or coin, which is not
|       specially weighted, falling on any given face is, for the
|       purposes of this Rule, close enough to equal to satisfy the
|       above requirement.
| 
| [CFJ 832: The dice-roll server at dice@danpost4.uni-c.dk meets these
|  requirements.]
| 
| History:
| Created by Proposal 1079, ca. Oct. 11 1994
| Amended(1) by Proposal 1648, Aug. 6 1995

clearly Agora is not without random elements. :)

i won't dispute the "perfect information" question.  Nomic is more
akin to "psychological" games like Diplomacy, where the most valuable
information you can have is "what is the other guy going to do".
games like this do not generally succumb to standard computerized
gaming techniques; they involve making effective psychological
evaluations of your opponents.  it will be a _very_ long time before a
computer will be able to play Nomic!

in parting, i should add that for further information on Agora Nomic,
send email to chess@watson.ibm.com, Agora's current Speaker.
