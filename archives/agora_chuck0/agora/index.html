<h2 align=center>What is Nomic?</h2>
<p class=longp>
Nomic is a game, invented by Peter Suber, in which a major portion of the game
is changing the Rules of the game.  A game of Nomic usually (not
always!) starts out as a democracy--one person will propose
a change to the Rules, everyone votes on it, and if there are
enough votes in favor of the change, the change takes place.
Play then continues by the new Rules.  

<p class=longp>
What's that?  You've
played in games where the Rules can be changed?  If you've
never played Nomic, it's a bit different than other games
which allow changing the Rules, such as Mao or certain party
games.  Although these games allow for some of the Rules to
be changed, they usually have a central, unchangeable core of
Rules.  In Nomic, <strong>all</strong> of the Rules are subject to change.  (At
least initially!  No guarantee it will stay that way.)

<h2 align=center>What is Agora?</h2>
<p class=longp>
Agora is the oldest known active nomic on the Internet--we 
celebrated our 6th birthday in June 1999!  Agora itself was
started following the collapse of another nomic, Nomic
World, which was the first known MUD-based nomic.  Five of
the participants of Nomic World are still Players in Agora
to this day!  (Michael, Blob, Oerjan, Steve, and Chuck)
<p class=longp>
Think you might be interested in playing?  <a href=
"/~ccarroll/agora/join.html">Here's some more information.</a>
<p class=longp>
Note for history buffs: Agora was not originally called Agora.
At its inception, it had no official name, and was unofficially
known as Yoyo after the mailing list it was played on.
