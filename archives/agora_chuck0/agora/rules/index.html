<h1 align=center>The Rules</h1>
<p align=center><strong>
The Rules were last updated on
May 5, 2001
<br>and include effects of Proposals through Proposal
4146, and Proposal 4149.
</strong>

<p>

<p class=longp>
When using my Rules on the web, I recommend you keep an eye on
the &quot;last updated&quot; date above.  Especially if you are
unsure if a recent set of Rule Changes has been incorporated
into these Rules.
<p class=longp>
From any of my Agora pages, you can navigate via the buttons at
the top of the page.

<p align=center>

<table width="80%" align=center>
<tr><td><a href="/~ccarroll/agora/"><img src="/~ccarroll/agora/ah.gif" alt=" [Agora Home] " width=122 height=38 border=0 align=middle></a>
 <td>takes you
to my list of outside Agora links and Nomic links.
<tr><td>&nbsp;
<tr><td><a href="/~ccarroll/agora/rules/"><img src="/~ccarroll/agora/rh.gif" alt=" [Rules Home] " width=122 height=38 border=0 align=middle></a>
 <td>brings you
to this page.
<tr><td>&nbsp;
<tr><td><a href="/~ccarroll/agora/rules/rulesets.html"><img src="/~ccarroll/agora/rs.gif" alt=" [Rulesets] " width=122 height=38 border=0 align=middle></a>
<td>takes you to a page from which you can see various versions of the
current Ruleset, as well as the Initial Ruleset.
<tr><td>&nbsp;
<tr><td><a href="/~ccarroll/cgi-bin/agscr/allr.pl"><img src="/~ccarroll/agora/loar.gif" alt=" [List of All Rules] " width=122 height=38 border=0></a>
 <td>takes you to a list of all current Rules, with their
numbers, powers, and titles listed.  You can link to each Rule
individually from there.
<tr><td>&nbsp;
<tr><td><a href="/~ccarroll/agora/rules/cats.html"><img src="/~ccarroll/agora/crl.gif" alt=" [Categorized Rule Lists] " width=122 height=38 border=0></a>
 <td>takes you to a list of categories and subcategories,
and allows you to find the Rules within those categories.  Warning: the
CRLs are currently in need of a major revision, but I don't know when
I'll be able to get around to it.
<tr><td>&nbsp;
<tr><td><a href="/~ccarroll/agora/rules/search.html"><img src="/~ccarroll/agora/str.gif" alt=" [Search the Rules] " width=122 height=38 border=0></a>
<td>allows free-text searching of the Rules.  This is a fairly new page,
so I am particularly interested in hearing comments on it.
<tr><td>&nbsp;
</table>
<p class=longp>
Within the various Rules documents, whenever a Rule Number is a hypertext
link, you can click on it to get to the Rule's full record, which
includes, among other things, its Number, Power, Title, text,
history, and categories that it's listed under in the Categorized
Rule Lists (which, it should be noted, is different from its Category
within the Logical Rulesets).

<h2 align=center>A Note on Rule Updates and Locking</h2>
<p class=longp>
When I am in the process of updating the Rules, the Rules on
the web are &quot;locked&quot; and you will not be able to access
them.  This is for two reasons.
<ol class=longp>
<li>I cannot guarantee that the programs used to give access to
the Rules over the web will work properly when I am in the middle
of updating the Rules
<p>
<li>Even if the programs did work properly, I do not want to 
mislead people by making available a Ruleset which has incorporated some,
but not all, of a set of Rule changes which took place at the
same time.
</ol>
<p class=longp>
When there is a set of changes to be made to the Rules, I try to
do them in a single sitting, in which case they should not take
more than an hour, or maybe two.  However, if there are an exceptionally
large number of Rule changes to record, it may take a few different sessions
over the course of a day or so in order to update the Rules, during
which time the Rules will remain locked.  I apologize for the
inconvenience, but I feel strongly about the reasons I listed above,
particularly the second.
