Text of Adopted Proposals

Proposal #4159 by Kelly, AI=1
Applications Revisited

Rule 1626 is amended to read as follows:

      An Application is any document which has been clearly labeled as
      an Application and which has been submitted as an Application by
      some person.  That person is known as the Application's Sponsor.

      The Sponsor of an Application may attach the signatures of other
      persons, or signatories, to the Application at the time e
      submits it.  The Sponsor may not attach any signature to an
      Application without first having obtained the explicit consent
      of the signatory.  A signatory may revoke eir consent, once
      granted, by informing the Sponsor.

      An Application is submitted by sending it to a Player designed
      by the Rules to receive Applications of that particular type,
      bearing a clear indication that the document in question is
      intended to be an Application and that it is being submitted by
      the Sponsor as an Application.  If the Rules do not otherwise
      designate a Player to receive a particular type of Application,
      the Speaker shall do so.  The effect of submitting an valid
      Application is determined by the Rules pertaining to
      Applications of that particular type.

      A person who submits an Application with signatures attached
      belonging to any person who has not consented to having eir
      signature attached to that Application commits the Class 4 Crime
      of Application Fraud.  An Application submitted with attached
      signatures belonging to a person who did not consent to such
      attachment is invalid.

      Signatures are presumed to have been attached with the consent
      of the signatory.  This presumption shall be rebutted only by a
      declaration from the alleged signatory, made within 60 days of
      the submission of the Application, stating that the signatory
      did not consent or that e consented and then subsequently
      revoked eir consent.  The Sponsor bears the burden of proof to
      show that such a declaration, once made, is false.

      It shall be a defense to the Crime of Application Fraud that the
      Sponsor did not receive a signatory's notice of revocation.

Rule 1727 is amended, by striking the words "Execute an Application"
and replacing them with "submit an Application".

Rules 1726, 1365, 1533, and 716 are each amended, by striking every
instance of the word "Executed" and replacing each such instance by
"submitted", by striking every instance of the word "Execution" and
replacing each such instance by "submission", and by striking every
instance of the word "Executing" and replacing each such instance by
"submitting".

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal #4160 by root, AI=1
Make Rule 1827 Consistent

Rule 1827 shall be amended by replacing the word "seven" in the fourth
paragraph (beginning "If a Judge fails...") with the word "five".

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal #4161 by Steve, AI=2
Fix 'Complacent Oligarchy'

Amend Rule 1965 (Complacent Oligarchy) to read:

      As soon as possible after an Ordinary Proposal fails Quorum, the
      Assessor shall publish a Notice of Complacency to that effect.

      Publication by the Assessor of a Notice of Complacency results in
      a copy of the Proposal being added to the Proposal Pool. This new
      Proposal is Democratic and Distributable, and is deemed to have
      been submitted by the entity that submitted the Ordinary Proposal.

      If an Ordinary Proposal has achieved Quorum, publication by the
      Assessor of a Notice of Complacency for that Proposal is the
      Class 2 Crime of Sending It Back Where It Don't Belong.
