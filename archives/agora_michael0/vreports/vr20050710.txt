Text of Adopted Proposals
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 4817 by Goethe, AI=2, Democratic
Complacency Kills Proposals


Proposal: Complacency Kills Proposals

Repeal Rule 1965 (Complacent Corporation).

[Now that everyone has a vote on Ordinary proposals, why
revote on quorum failures?]

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 4818 by Goethe, AI=1, Ordinary
Dud raffle


Proposal: Dud raffle

 [Raffle Tickets are basically Duds execept for an interesting
  property once a quarter.  If the maximum deck size is voted in
  with the current limit, having lots of both is a waste.]

The quota for Dud cards is hereby set to the current quota for dud
cards plus the current quota for Raffle Tickets.

The Deckmastor is hereby ordered to, asap, create one Dud copy for
each Raffle Ticket copy held when this proposal clause takes effect,
each in the hand of the Gambler that holds that Raffle Ticket copy.

Delete the card class definition of Raffle Ticket from the Onepower
Cardbook.

Add the following card class definition to the Onepower Cardbook:

      * Caption:   Lotto
        Frequency: Unique
        Elements:  Asleep[61]
        Exploit:   As soon as possible after this card is played, the
          Deckmastor shall randomly select a copy of a Dud in the
          possession of a Player and announce eir selection, unless no
          such copy exists.  Upon this announcement, the Player in
          possession gains three instances of the ephemeral Patent
          Title "Fortune's Fool", and each Dud in the possession of a
          Player is automatically discarded.

The Quota for Lotto is hereby set to 1.


Repeal Rule 2093 (The New Raffle).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 4819 by root, AI=2, Democratic
Feexin' Feexins


Maud is a co-author of this proposal.

Amend rule 1941 (Fees) to read:

      A fee-based action is an action with which the rules associate a
      fee, which must be a natural number.  If the rules describe a
      fee-based action but do not indicate the fee for that action,
      then that fee is zero.

      A player (the Actor) attempts to perform a fee-based action by
      announcing that e performs it; specifying the action to be
      performed; and, if the fee is nonzero, noting that there is a
      fee for the action.  The Actor has sufficient kudos to perform
      the action if the number of eir kudos meets or exceeds the fee.
      Upon eir announcement, the Actor's kudos are decreased by the
      fee, and if e had sufficient kudos, e performs the action.

      If the success of the Actor's attempt to perform a fee-based
      action is publicly challenged within a week of the time the
      action was attempted, then the Herald shall, as soon as
      possible, determine whether the Actor had sufficient kudos when
      e attempted to perform the action, and announce eir
      determination.

      If the Herald announces that the Actor did not have sufficient
      kudos to perform a fee-based action at the time of eir attempt,
      and eir announcement was published within a fortnight from the
      time the action was attempted, then the action shall be deemed
      not to have been performed.  If the Herald made this
      announcement within a week of the attempt to perform the action,
      or the success of the attempt was publicly challenged within a
      week of the attempt, then the Herald shall refund the Actor eir
      kudos.

      If the success of an Actor's attempt to perform a fee-based
      challenge is not publicly challenged within a week of the time
      the action was attempted, then the action shall be deemed to
      have been performed.

      Nothing in this rule shall act to prevent a person from
      performing a fee-based action by another mechanism for
      performing that action provided by the rules.

Amend rule 1940 (Periodic Compensations) to read:

      The boon of Public Service exists for the purpose of awarding
      officers for serving.

      Paperwork is a stuck switch for offices with states low and
      high.  The Associate Director of Personnel (ADoP) is the
      recordkeepor for paperwork.  For the purpose of this rule, the
      Speaker and the Distributor are considered offices.  The ADoP or
      the Speaker may flip the paperwork of an office with two
      supporters and without two objections.

      As soon as possible after the beginning of each month, the ADoP
      shall award 1 Public Service Boon for each office to the player
      (if any) who held that office for 16 or more days in the
      previous month; e shall award an additional Public Service boon
      to that player if the office is a high paperwork office.

      While a player is electee to an office, e may make one proposal
      distributable per month by publicly invoking that office's Civil
      Service Exemption, even if this would cause em to exceed eir
      per-player proposal limit.

Proposal 4820 by Goethe, AI=2, Democratic
The Fortinbras Repeal v1.1


Proposal: the Fortinbras Repeal v1.1
(AI-2)

v1.1
Simplifies R2036 (1/3 less text) without loss of function.

v1.0
Same as 0.2, looks ok to me.

v0.2
Brings proposal up to date (maybe?) with current Ruleset.
Also, simplifies language of R2036.  Net Rules change is
only -1, so Repeal is now singular, but elimination of
noisiness is still a procedural simplification.

v0.1
Noisiness and activity can be condensed.  While "inactive"
has more ramifications than "quiet", this is compensated by
finally protecting against quieting scams. Net change: -3 Rules.


Amend Rule 1016 (Activity Levels) to read:

      Activity is a stuck player switch with values active and
      inactive.

      "Off hold" and "on hold" are unambiguous synonyms for "active"
      and "inactive", respectively.

      A player may flip eir activity, unless e has done so within the
      past week.

      A player may, with Support and without 2 Objections, flip the
      activity of another player to inactive, if that other player has
      not made a public post in the last 30 days.  A player made
      inactive by this method becomes active immediately upon eir next
      public post.

      Inactive players may not vote, make proposals, hold office, or
      be a judge of a CFJ.  An inactive player may not be required by
      the rules to perform any duty or action, unless the rules
      explicitly state that they can require inactive players to
      perform that duty or action.

      This rule takes precedence over all other rules that regulate
      activity, or the powers or duties that a player may have because
      of eir activity.


Amend Rule 2036 (The Silent Treatment) to read:

      If a player (hereafter the Silent One) has been inactive
      continuously for three months, then any player may publish a
      Notice of Abandonment, identifying the silent one and alleging
      that e has abandoned the game.

      The publication of a Notice of Abandonment commences the Silent
      Treatment for the silent one.  If at any time during the silent
      treatment the silent one is not, or ceases to be, inactive, then
      the treatment is terminated, and the Registrar is relieved of
      all powers and responsibilities regarding it.

      As soon as possible after the commencement of the silent
      treatment, the Registrar shall publish in all designated Public
      Fora, and send to each listed e-mail address of the silent one,
      a Notice of Intent to Deregister, announcing the Registrar's
      intent to deregister the silent one after one month has passed.

      If the silent treatement has not terminated a month after the
      publication of the Notice of Intent to Deregister, then the
      Registrar shall, as soon as possible, publish in all designated
      Public Fora, and send to each listed e-mail address of the
      silent one, a Notice of Deregistration identifying the silent
      one.  A Notice of Deregistration is valid if and only if it is
      published by the Registrar, following the procedures described
      in this Rule.

      Upon publication of a valid Notice of Deregistration, the
      following events occur in order:

      (1) if the silent one is the Speaker, e ceases to be Speaker;

      (2) the silent one is deregistered;

      (3) the silent treatment for that player concludes.


Amend Rule 559 (The Registrar) by replacing:

         (v) each player's activity level, and the most recent date on
             which that player's activity level changed;

        (vi) each player's Noisy/Quiet/Silent status, and the most
             recent date on which that player became Noisy, Quiet,
             or Silent; and

       (vii) the identity of the Distributor.

with:

         (v) each player's activity level, and the most recent date
             and method by which that player's activity level changed;

        (vi) the identity of the Distributor.


Amend Rule 2107 (Contracts) by replacing the text 'becomes Silent'
                                   with the text 'is deregistered'

Amend Rule 698 (Always an Eligible Judge) by deleting all occurrences
of the term 'non-silent' and then by deleting all occurrences of the
term 'silent'.

Repeal Rule 1042 (Deregistration Due to Silence).

Delete the 'Loot the Dead' card definition from the Onepower cardbook.
