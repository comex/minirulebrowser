Proposal 4733 by root, AI=1, Ordinary
Clarify Card Plays


Amend Rule 2069 by replacing the text that reads:

       (d) An Exploit is an action that the Holder of that Card (and
           only the Holder of that Card) may take if and only if e
           meets the requirements and/or pays the costs outlined in
           that Exploit. Any reference to "you," "your" or a similar
           pronoun in the text of an Exploit refers to the Holder of
           that Card. Taking an action described in an Exploit is known
           as Playing the Card. Unless a Rule says otherwise, a Card is
           automatically transferred to the Discard Pile immediately
           after being Played.

with:

       (d) An Exploit is an action that the Holder of that Card (and
           only the Holder of that Card) may take if and only if e
           clearly indicates the card whose Exploit e is performing and
           e meets the requirements and/or pays the costs outlined in
           that Exploit. Any reference to "you," "your" or a similar

Proposal 4734 by Sherlock, AI=1, Ordinary
Card Experiments


Create a rule entitled "Contreras Card Labs" with the following text in
the category "The University of Agora":

       The University encourages Card experimentation.

       A Player may publish a piece of text and note that it is a Card
       Blueprint.  If this text contains a Caption, a copy of that Card
       is created in the possession of the Library.  The Card Blueprint
       may also specify Elements and Exploits, as defined by other rules,
       and these are included on the Card in the same way they would be
       if they were included on a rules-defined Card.

       Cards created by this method have a Quota of 1 and are considered
       to be in eir Trial Run.  A Card in its Trial Run may not be checked
       out of the Library until seven days have passed since its creation.
       Any player may destroy a Card in its Trial Run by announcing e does
       so.

       A Card in its Trial Run is transferred to the Library after it is
       played.

Amend 2068 (The Deckmastor) by changing the text that reads:

       Only the Deckmastor may create or destroy Cards, and

to read:

       Only the Deckmastor may create or destroy Cards not in eir Trial
       Run, and

Proposal 4736 by Quazie, AI=1, Ordinary
Yes.


Append the following to rule 1922

       (e) Hyperactive, to be awarded to any player who has more than 10
           proposals pass in one week.

Quazie is awarded the patent title of Hyperactive for his proposals
that passed from the distribution on April 11th


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Proposal 4738 by Manu, AI=1, Ordinary
Easier Card Fees 2


[In the Cards section, "cost" appears once and "fee" 11 times.]

In Rule 2069, replace the text reading:

       (d) An Exploit is an action that the Holder of that Card (and
           only the Holder of that Card) may take if and only if e
           meets the requirements and/or pays the costs outlined in
           that Exploit.

       (d) An Exploit is an action that the Holder of that Card (and
           only the Holder of that Card) may take if and only if e
           meets the requirements and/or pays the fees outlined in
           that Exploit.

Create a new Rule titled "Card Fees" which reads:

       All fees associated with Card Actions, Elements and Exploits
       must be paid as soon as possible by the Gambler incurring the
       fee. For every Kudo not paid on time, the Gambler commits the
       Class 1 Infraction of Debt Overdue, which may be reported by any
       Player.

       This rule takes precedence over all rules pertaining to Cards
       fees.

Proposal 4739 by root, AI=1, Ordinary
Pragmatic Reshuffles


Amend Rule 2069 by replacing the text reading:

            If, at any time, the number of pending draws for all
            gamblers is greater than the number of cards in the Deck,
            then the Deckmastor shall transfer all of the cards in the
            Discard Pile to the Deck before dealing any cards.  This
            transfer is known as a Reshuffle and is performed as a
            single action.

with:

            Whenever a player makes a true announcement that the number
            of pending draws for all gamblers is greater than the
            number of cards in the Deck, or that there are no cards in
            the Deck, then the Deckmastor shall transfer all of the
            cards in the Discard Pile to the Deck before dealing any
            cards.  This transfer is known as a Reshuffle and is
            performed as a single action.

Proposal 4740 by Quazie, AI=1, Ordinary

in Rule 1932 change

         Quota: 8
         Elements: Restricted [Shareholders]

         Elements: Restricted [Shareholders], Budgeted

and set the budget equal to 3

In rule 2075 change

       The Deckmastor's Budget shall contain between one and three

to

       The Deckmastor's Budget shall contain between one and five


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Proposal 4743 by Manu, AI=1, Ordinary
Contracts


Create a new Rule entitled "Contracts" which reads as follow:

       There exists a type of agreement known as a Contract. A Contract
       is an Entity. The content of a Contract is called its
       Regulations. The first Player to announce the creation of a
       Contract is its Executor and is known as the Notary of that
       Contract. Any other Player may decide to become part of a
       Contract by notifying that Contract's Notary. Players party to a
       Contract, including the Notary, are the Members of this
       Contract. A Member may leave a Contract at any time by notifying
       the Notary.

       A Contract may contain any number of Regulations. Regulations
       have the power to constrain the actions of Players in the same
       manner as the Rules.  However, Regulations have power over only
       those Players that are Members of that Contract. All Members
       are required to abide by the Regulations, unless doing so would
       violate the Rules. Violation of this requirement is the Class 1
       Crime of Insubordination. A Contract may include in its
       Regulations ways for Players to leave the Contract.

       Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, no Player shall ever
       involuntarily become a Member of a Contract.

       If the Notary of a Contract becomes Silent, all Members of this
       Contract cease to be Members of this Contract and the Contract
       ceases to exist.

       Only Members of a Contract may CFJ that a Member has violated
       that Contract. All Members of a Contract are automatically
       ineligible to Judge a CFJ that a Member has violated that
       Contract.

       All Rules regulating agreements that are inconsistent with this
       Rule are superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.

Create a new Rule entitled "Contract Maintenance" that reads:

       The Notary of a given Contract must provide a copy of its
       Regulations to any other Player who requests it, as soon as
       possible after the request is made.  The Notary of a
       Contract must also provide an updated copy of the Regulations
       to all Members as soon as possible after the Regulations change
       for any reason. Regulations can not be changed except in
       accordance with the Rules. Regulations are permitted to define
       their own mechanisms for changing their own content, and any
       change to Regulations adopted in accordance with their own
       mechanisms is legal.

       The Notary may, without objection, change the Regulations
       provided e sends a copy of the new Regulations to all Members
       as soon as possible.

Rename Rule 2096 to "Card-Carrying Contracts" and amend it to read:

       A Contract may be made into a Card-Carrying Contract by its
       Notary acting with two support and without two objections.
       A player may only be Notary of one Card-Carrying Contract
       at a time.

       A Card-Carrying Contract is a gambler, and may perform the
       following actions only as explicitly permitted by its
       regulations:
         1.  As long as the Contract has at least three Members and its
             hand size is less than the maximum hand size, it may draw
             a number of cards each month equal to its number of
             Members at the beginning of the month divided by two and
             rounded up.
         2.  Transfer or discard cards.

       A Card-Carrying Contract may not play cards.


Amend Rule 910 to read:

        The Justiciar is an office; its holder is responsible for
        justice, serving on a Board of Appeals when necessary.


In Rule 1727, replace the part that reads:

       BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Herald may select one Contest,
       in existence on Agora's Birthday, which has as its purpose
       encouraging the celebration of Agora's Birthday.  Within the
       month following Agora's Birthday, that Contest may award its
       Members the Patent Title Nth Anniversary Ribbon, where N is the
       number of years of Agora's existence;
