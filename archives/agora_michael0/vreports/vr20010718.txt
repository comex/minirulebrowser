+ Murphy cast two votes for 4189 one to the PF and one privately.
  I believe legal tradition means that both count. Either way, it
  does not affect the result?

Proposal #4184 by Kelly, AI=1
Heroism is Catching

Douglas Hofstadter is hereby declared a Hero.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal #4185 by Ziggy, AI=2
Don't be overkill

In Rule 1937, change 'Class 2 Infraction of Oligardiness' to 'Class 1
Infraction of Oligardiness' each time it appears.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal #4187 by neil, AI=2
Make Buying Democracy Easier

Amend Rule 1934 (The Speaker, Sanity, and Buying Democracy) to read:

      An Untainted Speaker may, with 3 Supporters, Sanitise an Interested
      Proposal which would otherwise be an Ordinary Proposal, for
      which the Voting Period has not yet concluded, and which has
      never been the subject of an Attempt to Democratise.

      If a Proposal is Sanitised before its Voting Period commences,
      said Proposal becomes a Democratic Proposal, becomes a Sane Proposal,
      and has its Distribution Cost modified as required by other Rules.

      If a Proposal is Sanitised during its Voting Period, said
      Proposal is not modified until at least one Papyrus is publicly
      transferred to the Bank solely for this stated purpose by any
      Player during the Proposal's Voting Period.  If this happens,
      the Proposal becomes a Democratic Proposal, the Proposal becomes
      a Sane Proposal, and all votes thus far cast on the Proposal are
      cancelled.  The Assessor shall announce that the Proposal ha
      been successfully Sanitised; the Voting Period of the Proposal
      is extended to end seven days after this announcement.

      Any Player may, With Support, make an Attempt to Democratise an
      Interested Proposal which would otherwise be an Ordinary
      Proposal, and for which the Voting Period has not yet concluded.
      There is a Fee of 0.1 VEs for a Player other than an Untainted
      Speaker to make an Attempt to Democratise.  This Fee must be
      paid publicly.

      Once an Attempt to Democratise a Proposal has been made, until
      the end of the Proposal's Voting Period, any Player may publicly
      transfer any number of VEs to the Bank with a clear, unambiguous
      statement that this transfer is made solely for the purpose of
      Democratising the Proposal, or solely for the purpose of keeping
      the Proposal Ordinary.

      At the end of the Voting Period, Democratisation succeeds if at
      least as many VEs have been publicly transferred to the Bank for
      Democratisating the Proposal as for keeping the Proposal
      Ordinary.  The Assessor shall announce as soon as possible after
      the end of the Voting Period whether or not Democratisation of
      that Proposal has succeeded.

      If Democratisation does not succeed, the Voting Period is
      considered to have ended as usual.  The Attempt does not in any
      way modify the Proposal in question.

      If Democratisation succeeds, the Proposal becomes a Democratic
      Proposal, and all Votes thus far cast on the Proposal are
      cancelled.  The Voting Period for that Proposal is considered
      not to have ended (except for the purposes of this Attempt to
      Democratise), and is extended to end seven days after the
      Assessor's announcement that Democratisation has succeeded.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal #4188 by Goethe, AI=1
Indulgence Auctions Happen

[This Proposal makes sure the indulgence glut decays,
 just more slowly while keeping auctions happening thus encouraging
 continued flow. (if the Herald wishes: e may still keep the
 current supply level) ]

Amend Rule 1712 by, immediately after the following sentence:

      The Actual Indulgence Circulation Level (AICL) is the
      total number of Indulgences owned by entities other than the Bank,
      augmented by the total number of Indulgences owned by the Bank
      which have been auctioned off to Winning Bidders in prior
      Indulgence Auctions but not yet paid for.

 adding the Following sentence:

      The Monthly Bank Indulgence Gain (MBIG) is the number of
      Indulgences transferred from other entities to the Bank during
      a given Nomic Month, less the number of Indulgences transferred
      from the Bank to other entities during that same Nomic Month.


Amend Rule 1712 by replacing the following words:

                 if the Indulgence Differential is not greater than
      zero, the Herald shall not auction any Indulgences that month.

 with the following words:

               if the Indulgence Differential is not greater than
      zero, the Herald shall auction a whole number of Indulgences
      equal to or less than one half the MBIG for the preceeding
      month, with a minimum of 0 Indulgences.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal #4190 by Steve, AI=1
Executors Revamped

Change the Title of Rule 1478 to "Executors and Limited Executors" and
amend it to read:

  (a) An Executor of an entity is a Player who is empowered by the Rules
      to act on behalf of that entity, who is called the Executee. There
      may be more than one such Player. An Executor of an Executee may
      perform on behalf of the Executee all such actions as the Rules
      permit the Executee to perform.

  (b) A Limited Executor of an entity is a Player who is empowered by
      the Rules to perform on behalf of that entity a subset of the
      actions which the Rules permit the entity to perform. A Limited
      Executor is permitted to perform on behalf of an Executee only
      such actions as are explicitly permitted by the Rules.

  (c) A Player is always eir own Executor. Other entities have Executors
      (or Limited Executors) only as and when the Rules provide.

  (d) A Player acting on behalf of an entity other than emself must
      clearly indicate on whose behalf e is acting. A Player who does
      not clearly indicate that e is acting on behalf of some entity
      other than emself is presumed to be acting on eir own behalf.

  (e) Only persons may perform actions. Non-persons perform actions only
      via the agency of persons, as specified by the Rules.


Create a Rule, entitled "Prime Executors", which reads:

  (a) The Prime Executor of an entity with respect to a certain action
      is the Player who is responsible for performing that action. For
      each action that an entity is required to perform, there shall be
      at most one Prime Executor of that entity with respect to that
      action. Any penalty incurred due to an entity's failure to perform
      as required by the Rules is incurred by the Prime Executor of that
      entity.

  (b) Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the Prime Executor
      of an entity with respect to a certain action must be an Executor
      of that entity, or a Limited Executor of that entity who is
      permitted to perform that action on behalf of that entity.

  (c) If the Rules designate a Player to be the Prime Executor of an
      entity, without specifying particular actions that the Prime
      Executor is responsible for performing, then that Player is the
      Prime Executor of that entity with respect to all actions that the
      entity is required to perform.

  (d) Unless otherwise specified by the Rules, each Player is eir own
      Prime Executor.


Amend Rule 1841 (Granting Power of Attorney) to read:

  (a) A Player (the Grantor) who has been continuously registered for
      more than two months is empowered to give eir Power of Attorney
      (PoA) to another Player (the Holder), as specified in this Rule.

  (b) The Holder holds the Grantor's PoA if all of the following
      conditions are met:
      (1) the Grantor has announced that e grants eir PoA to the Holder;
      (2) the Holder has, in the week immediately preceding or
          immediately following the Grantor's announcement, publically
          consented to hold the Grantor's PoA;
      (3) the Holder is Active; and
      (4) the grant of PoA has not been withdrawn for any of the reasons
          listed in (d).

  (c) The grant of PoA commences at the time the Grantor grants eir PoA
      to the Holder, or at the time the Holder consents to the grant, or
      at the time specified by the Grantor, whichever is latest. If the
      Grantor specifies a time at which the grant of PoA is to commence,
      it must be a time no more than seven says from the Grantor's
      announcement. Later specifications are without effect for the
      purposes of this Rule.

  (d) The grant of PoA is withdrawn if:
      (1) the period of the grant specified by the Grantor expires;
      (2) the Grantor publically withdraws the grant;
      (3) the Grantor is deregistered;
      (4) the Assessor is mischevious;
      (5) the Holder is deregistered or goes On Hold; or
      (6) the Holder has held the PoA continuously for three months.

  (e) Nothing in this Rule shall be construed as preventing other Rules
      from granting and withdrawing PoA by other means.

  (f) Other Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, no Player who has
      granted PoA to another Player as described in this Rule shall
      become a Zombie while the grant of PoA is in effect.


Amend Rule 1842 (Power of Attorney) to read:

  (a) The Rules may grant a Player, called the Holder, Power of Attorney
      for another Player, called the Grantor. Power of Attorney is
      granted only as specified by the Rules, and shall last only as
      long as the Rules specify.

  (b) While the Holder is granted Power of Attorney for the Grantor, the
      Holder is an Executor of the Grantor, and the Prime Executor of
      the Grantor.

  (c) No Player is permitted to have Power of Attorney for more than
      two other Players.


Amend Rule 1531 by replacing the text in it which reads "and be the
Executor of that Organization" with text which reads "and be the
Executor and Prime Executor of that Organization".


Amend R1470 (The Bank) to read:

  (a) There is an entity known as the Bank. The Bank has Mint Authority.
      The Bank is the Mintor of each Bank Currency. The Bank is
      permitted to transfer Property in its possession to other
      entities.

  (b) The Treasuror is the Executor of the Bank. Each Recordkeepor of
      each Bank Currency is a Limited Executor of the Bank, and is
      empowered to make transfers of that Currency from the Bank.

  (c) Each Recordkeepor of each Bank Currency is the Prime Executor of
      the Bank with respect to debts denominated in that Currency. The
      Treasuror is the Prime Executor of the Bank with respect to all
      other actions that the Bank is required to perform.

  (d) As soon as possible after the Bank incurs a debt to any other
      entity, the Bank shall either satisfy that debt by transferring
      appropriate Properties to the creditor, or dispute the debt by
      whatever means are appropriate in the situation.

  (e) The Bank is permitted to forgive debts owed to it, in whole or in
      part:
      (1) pursuant to a properly-issued Order; or
      (2) Without Objection, at the Treasuror's discretion.


Amend Rule 1981 (Embezzlement and Receiving Stolen Property) to read:

  (a) A transfer of Property from one entity to another entity which is
      made without being explicitly required or permitted by the Rules
      is unauthorized.

  (b) A Player who intentionally makes a valid but unauthorized transfer
      of Property from any entity to another entity commits the Class 10
      Crime of Embezzlement.

  (c) An entity which receives Property from any entity as the result of
      an intentional, valid and unauthorized transfer incurs a debt to
      the transferor for all such Property.

  (d) A Player who has been informed that e, or an entity of which e is
      the Prime Executor, has incurred a debt of the type decribed in
      (c) and who does not act to satisfy that debt within in a week of
      being informed of it commits the Class 10 Crime of Receiving
      Stolen Property.

  (e) For the the purposes of this Rule, a valid but unauthorized
      transfer is considered to have been made intentionally if and only
      if, at the time of the transfer, the Player making it:
      (1) knew that the transfer was valid;
      (2) knew that the transfer was unauthorized; and
      (3) realized that e was making the transfer.

  (f) In particular, a Player who makes a valid but unauthorized
      transfer of Property as the result of an accident or mistake does
      not commit Embezzlement.


Amend Rule 683 (Voting on Proposals) by deleting from it the text which
reads:

      A vote cast by an entity which does not have an Executor is cast
      at a time and in a manner specified in other Rules.


Amend Rule 947 (Bonus for Repeal) to read:

  (a) If there are 100 or more Rules, and a Proposal is adopted which,
      as part of all of its effect, repeals one or more Rules, and if,
      in the Rulekeepor's estimation, the Proposal simplifies the
      Ruleset, then the Rulekeepor shall pay out 30 Stems to the
      Proposer of that Proposal. If the Rulekeepor decides that the
      Proposal does not simplify the Ruleset, e must announce this
      decision.

  (b) When the Rulekeepor decides that such a Proposal does not simplify
      the Ruleset, the Proposal's Proposer may reverse the Rulekeepor's
      decision Without Three Objections, provided the procedure for
      doing so is initiated within one week of the announcement of the
      Rulekeepor's decision. Blob is Mauvy. As soon as possible after 
      the Rulekeepor's decision is reversed in this manner, the Proposal's 
      Proposer shall pay out 30 Stems to emself.


Amend Rule 1959 (Wills) to read:

  (a) An entity's Will is a description of how the entity's Property
      should be distributed in the event that the entity ceases to have
      an Executor. The Notary shall keep a record of all Wills.

  (b) An entity creates a Will for itself by publishing it.


Amend Rule 1598 (Property Transfers) by replacing the phrase
"transferor's Executor" in paragraph (f) with the word "transferor".

Be it further resolved that Razl is Noisy.

Proposal #4191 by Goethe, AI=1
Points Contests

[Ver. 2.0

 * Makes a kind of Contest that Players can enter to get points
   (useful for things like Mafia, etc.).
 * Putting it in "contest" mode makes it more flexible than
   "hardcoding" every Points game into the Rules.
 * Limiting it based on points per player per month (in relation
   to win condition) means that it can be used as a scam to get points,
   but the scam is a boring, low profit one.
]

Add the Following Rule, titled "Points Contests":

      A Contest may be a Points Contest if its ACO specifically
      states that it is a Points Contest.
      A Player may not be the Contestsmaster of more than one
      Points Contest in a single Nomic month.

      PWIN is the number of points required for a Player to
      achieve a win condition, as defined elsewhere in the Rules.
      PPP (Points Per Player) is PWIN divided by twenty.

      Once during each month that starts while the Contest
      exists, a Points Contest's Contestmaster may post a
      single valid Notice of Award to the Public Forum, listing
      any number of the Contest's Contestants, and a listing a
      positive number of Points to be awarded to each Contestant
      on the list.  Different Contestants may be awarded
      different numbers of points in the same listing.  The posting
      must obey all regulations for such posting contained in
      the Contest's SLC to be valid.

      The total Points listed to be awarded to all Contestants
      in each such monthly Notice may not exceed PPP times the
      number of Players who were Contestants of the Contest at
      any time in the 14 days prior to the Notice.  If more
      points than this are listed the Notice is invalid.

      The total number of Points that a single Player may receive
      from all Points Contests in a single month may not exceed
      PWIN divided by five.  If a Points Contest Notice would bring a
      Player's total to more points than this than the Notice is invalid
      for that Player only.

      The posting of such a Notice of Award, if valid, is
      an event Awarding the listed Points to the listed Players.

Proposal #4193 by Taral, AI=1
Tax Avoidance v3

Amend Rule 1853 (Levying Taxes) by replacing the text:

      (b) all Rebellious Players

with the text:

      (b) all Rebellious Players who were Rebellious at the time the
          intent to levy was published

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal #4194 by neil, AI=1
Opposite Proposals

Enact the Following Rule entitled `Opposite Proposals':

        Each time the Promotor distributes Proposals, e shall first
        select at random a single distributable Proposal, to be known
        as the Target.  E may then distribute with these Proposals an
        Opposite Proposal for the Target.  If e does so, e may, Without
        2 Objections, pay out 0.1 Papyri to eirself.

        An Opposite Proposal should be clearly marked as such.  It
        should be substantially the opposite, in spirit or effect, of
        its Target.  An Opposite Proposal shall have the same status
        as its Target, including AI, Sanity, Insanity, Urgentness,
        Disinterestedness, and Democraticity; except that, if the
        Target does not have an AI of at least 2, the Opposite
        Proposal shall be neither Democratic nor Sane.

        The Promotor shall be considered to be the proposer of the
        Opposite Proposal, but shall incur no penalties as a result of
        being its proposer.  This Rule takes precedence over all Rules
        which would impose such penalties.
