Proposal 4352 by OscarMeyr, AI=2
Overhaul Parliamentary Voting

Amend R1950 by replacing the text:
      (c) An entity's Voting Power on a Parliamentary Proposal is as
          follows:
            (1) One, if the entity is one of the following:
                (a)   The Oligarchy;
                (b)   The Democracy;
                (c)   The Speakership.
            (2) Any other entity, zero.

With this text:
      (c) An entity's Voting Power on a Parliamentary Proposal is as
          follows:
            (1) One, if the entity is one of the following:
                (a)   The First Estate;
                (b)   The Second Estate;
                (c)   The Third Estate.
            (2) Any other entity, zero.

Change R2020 to read:

      For a Parliamentary Proposal, the Assessor will count as
      "Preliminary Votes" after the voting period has ended:
        1.  For the First Estate, communications from Acolyte Players
        or their executors that would have been legal votes if the
        Proposal had been Sane.
        2.  For the Second Estate, communications from Politician
        Players or their executors that would have been legal votes if 
        the Proposal had been Sane.
        3.  For the Third Estate, communications from Scribe Players
        or their executors that would have been legal votes if the
        Proposal had been Sane.

      For each Estate, if the preliminary votes of Players in that
      Estate (both voting index and quorum) would have passed the
      Proposal were they deemed to be Democratic votes on a Sane
      Proposal, then that Estate shall be deemed to have cast 1 vote FOR
      the Proposal; otherwise, that Estate shall be deemed to have cast
      1 vote AGAINST the Proposal. The timing of all votes cast on
      Parliamentary Proposals shall be deemed to be an instant before
      the end of the Voting Period. There are no other specific
      mechanisms for casting votes on Parliamentary Proposals.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 4353 by Steve, AI=1
Permitting Pay Outs

Amend Rule 1479 (Definition of "Pay Out" and Bill") to read:

  (a) Whenever a Rule requires a Player to pay out one or more
      Properties to some entity, the Bank shall incur a debt to that
      entity for those Properties, and the named Player shall, as
      soon as possible, post a public notice of the debt.

  (b) If a Rule explicitly permits a Player to pay out one or more
      Properties to some entity, but does not require em to do so, then
      the Bank shall incur a debt to that entity for those Properties
      when the Player posts a public notice of the debt.

  (c) Whenever a Rule requires a Player to bill an entity for one or
      more Properties, that entity shall incur a debt to the Bank for
      those Properties, and the named Player shall, as soon as
      possible, post a public notice of the debt.

Proposal 4354 by RedKnight, AI=2
Fix Rule 2027

Amend Rule 2027 by replacing the word "he" with "e"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 4355 by Steve, AI=2
Clarify Proposal Distribution
 
[Tidies up some unclarities in the Rules dealing with Proposals.]
 
Amend Rule 1770 (Distributing Proposals) to read:
 
  (a) The Promotor is permitted to distribute a Distributable Proposal
      at any time.
 
  (b) During each Week, the Promotor is required to distribute every
      Proposal that was Distributable at the beginning of that Week,
      unless the Proposal has since ceased to be Distributable.
 
  (c) If there were no Distributable Proposals at the beginning of the
      Week, then the Promotor is required publically to note this fact
      at some time during the Week.
 
  (d) Failure by the Promotor to either distribute Proposals as required
      in (b), or to make an announcement as required in (c), is the
      Class 1 Infraction of Promotor Tardiness, which any Player may
      report.
 
  (e) The Promotor shall include with the distribution of each Proposal
      the identity of its Proposing Entity, its Adoption Index, and an
      indication of the Proposal's Chamber. However, the failure of the
      Promotor to include any of these accompaniments with a Proposal
      does not deprive the distribution of the Proposal of any legal
      effect.
 
  (f) A Proposal is legally distributed only if it is accompanied by an
      explicit indication that it is being distributed. When a Proposal 
      is distributed, it is removed from the Proposal Pool.
 
  (g) The Promotor shall not distribute any Proposal which is not
      Distributable, and must abort any Proposal so distributed. If the
      Promotor aborts a Proposal which e knows was Distributable at the
      time it was distributed, e commits the Class 2 Crime of Illegal
      Abortion.
 
  (h) The Promotor aborts a Proposal by publishing an announcement to
      that effect, clearly identifying the Proposal which has been
      aborted.

  (i) The distribution of an Undistributable Proposal, when the
      Promotor knows that the Proposal is Undistributable, is the
      Class 2 Crime of Promotor Misrepresentation. The distribution of
      a text purporting to be a Proposal, when the Promotor knows that
      the text is not a Proposal, is the Class 5 Crime of Promotor
      Fraud.
 
 
Create a new Rule, entitled "Aborting a Proposal", which reads:
 
  (a) When a Proposal is aborted:
      (1)  the Voting Period for the Proposal immediately ends, if it
           has not ended already;
      (2)  all Votes cast on the Proposal are cancelled, and the
           Proposal fails;
      (3)  the Assessor is relieved of any duty to report on Votes
           cast on the Proposal; and
      (4)  a copy of the Proposal is added to the Proposal Pool.
 
 
Amend Rule 2021 (Chamber Procedure) to read:
 
  (a) The Chamber Fee for a Proposal is initially 0.1 Voting
      Entitlements.  Any Politician may change the Chamber of a Proposal
      that is not Sane to another Chamber of eir choice, by publically
      paying this Fee, provided that it is legal for the Proposal to be
      in the new Chamber.
 
  (b) When a Proposal's Chamber is changed via this Rule:
      (1) the Chamber Fee for the Proposal is doubled; and
      (2) if the Proposal is in its Voting Period, it is Aborted as
          described elsewhere, and returned to the Proposal Pool with
          its Distributability and other characteristics intact.
 
  (c) An Untainted Speaker, with 2 Supporters, may Sanitise a
      Distributed Proposal that is not already Sane and for which the
      Voting Period has not ended. If the Speaker Sanitises a Proposal,
      the Proposal is Aborted as described elsewhere; the Proposal
      remains Distributable, but becomes Democratic and Sane.

Proposal 4356 by Steve, AI=1
Auction Errors, etc. 

[Comment: what this Proposal does:
* allows mistakes made in any Auction based on the DAP to stand Without
  2 Objections.
* handles defaulting on Auction payments.
* redefines debt forgiveness.
* makes numerous small changes to expression in the Rules for Auctions.
]

Amend Rule 1887 (Default Procedure for Auctions) to read:

      When an Auction is to be held and the procedure is not specified,
      the Auctioneer may select a rules-defined Auction Procedure. If e
      does not specify which procedure is to be used, the Default
      Auction Procedure shall be used.

      The Default Auction Procedure is as follows:

      (a) Auctioneer: the Auctioneer is the Player who initiates the
          Auction, and is responsible for collecting bids and announcing
          the result of the Auction. If the Rules require (or permit) an
          Auction to be initiated, but do not specify which Player shall
          initiate it, then the Speaker shall (or may) initiate it.

      (b) Bidders: every Player not on Hold may bid in an Auction.
          Activity is measured at the time a Player sends eir bid.

      (c) Auction Currency: each Auction is conducted in one particular
          currency. The Rule providing for a particular Auction must
          specify the currency to be used, or the Auction cannot take
          place.

      (d) Number of lots: each Auction is conducted for 1 or more
          identical lots of identical items, which must all be owned by
          the same entity. Throughout this Rule, N indicates the number
          of lots up for bid in the Auction.

      (e) Start of Auction: the Auction begins when the first
          announcement that an Auction has begun is made by a Player
          authorized to initiate the Auction. The announcement must
          contain:
          (1) the identity of the Auctioneer;
          (2) the Auction Currency;
          (3) the number of items being Auctioned; and
          (4) the value of the Starting Bid.

      (f) Errors in initiating Auctions: if one of the required elements
          is missing from the announcement initiating the Auction, or is
          incorrect, then the Auctioneer may let the Auction stand
          Without 2 Objections. If the Auction stands, then the
          announcement initiating the Auction is deemed to have been
          legal and correct for the purposes of the Rules. If the
          Auction does not stand, it is deemed not to have occurred.

      (g) Starting Bid: the Starting Bid is the minimum possible value
          of a bid. If not otherwise specified, the Starting Bid is
          equal to the MUQ of the Auction Currency.

      (h) Bidding: a bid is a public message from a bidder identifying
          the Auction e is bidding in, and specifying the amount of eir
          bid. Each bidder may make as many bids as e likes during the
          Auction.  A bid is only valid if it satisfies the following
          conditions:
          (1) it is made after the start of the Auction, and before its
              end;
          (2) the amount of the bid is a multiple of the MUQ of the
              Auction Currency; and
          (3) the amount of the bid is no less than the Starting Bid.

      (i) Cancelling bids: a bidder may cancel eir bid while the Auction
          is in progress by publically identifying the bid to be
          cancelled.


      (j) End of Auction: the Auction ends if any of the following occur:
          (1) one week has passed from the start of the Auction, and no
              bids have been made; or
          (2) a bid has been made in the Auction, and 72 hours have
              passed without there being a change in the N highest bids
              in the Auction; or
          (3) 14 days have passed since the Auction began.

      (k) Winning bids: when the Auction ends, the winning bids are
          the N largest uncancelled valid bids in the Auction (or
          all valid uncancelled Bids, if there were less than N valid
          uncancelled bids). Ties shall be broken in favor of earlier-
          submitted bids. If there were no bids in the Auction, then the
          Auction has no winner.

      (l) Final Auction Price: the Final Auction Price is either:
          (1) the amount of the Nth highest bid, if there were N or
              more valid uncancelled bids in the auction; or
          (2) the Starting Bid, if there were greater than zero but
              fewer than N valid uncancelled bids.

      (m) Billing for winning bids: as soon as possible after the end of
          the Auction, the Auctioneer shall announce the winning bids
          and issue to each winning bidder a separate bill for each of
          eir winning bids.

      (n) Defaulting: a winning bidder has a week from the time e is
          billed by the Auctioneer for a winning bid e made to satisfy
          the debt arising from that bid. If e does not do so, e commits
          the Class 2 Infraction of Defaulting (reportable by the
          Auctioneer), and thereafter loses eir right to purchase the
          Auctioned item by paying the debt arising from that bid. As
          soon as possible after a winning bidder defaults on a bid, the
          Auctioneer shall Order the owner of the items being Auctioned
          (normally the Bank) to forgive the unsatisfied debt arising
          from the bid.

      (o) Unless specified otherwise, the owner of the Auctioned items
          shall incur a debt of one Auctioned lot of items to the
          winning bidder when the bill for that lot is paid.


Change the Title of Rule 1887 to "Auctions and the Default Auction
Procedure".

Amend Rule 1936 (Auctioning Positions in the Oligarchy) by deleting from
it the text which reads:

          (5) Defaulting: a winning bidder has one week from the time
              e is billed by the Auctioneer for eir winning bid in
              which to pay the bill. If the bill remains unpaid for
              more than one week, then the winning bidder is
              considered to have defaulted. In that case, the
              Auctioneer shall forgive the debt and penalise the
              defaulting bidder 2 Blots.


Amend Rule 1596 (Debt) by replacing the text in it which currently
reads:

      (d) A debt is forgiven when the creditor of a debt sends a
          notice to the debtor that e is forgiving the debt.
          Forgiveness may be for the entire debt or for any part
          thereof.  The effect forgiving a debt is as if the debtor
          had made a payment on the debt for the portion forgiven,
          except that no transfer of property takes place thereby.

with text which reads:

      (d) A debt is forgiven when the creditor of a debt sends a notice
          to the debtor that e is forgiving the debt. Forgiveness may be
          for the entire debt or for any part thereof. The effect of
          forgiving a debt is to relieve the debtor of the obligation
          arising from that part of the debt which has been forgiven to
          transfer Property to the creditor.


Amend Rule 1712 (Distribution of Indulgences) by deleting from it the
text which currently reads:

      If the Herald makes an error in determining the number of
      Indulgences to be Auctioned, in good faith, that number shall be
      allowed to stand.


Amend Rule 1983 (Vickrey Auctions) to read:

      The Auction Procedure for a Vickrey Auction is the same as the
      Default Auction Procedure with the following modifications:

      (a) Bidders: any Player with the same Executor as the Auctioneer
          may bid only in the first 72 hours of the Auction.

      (b) Bidding: if a bidder has the same Executor as the Auctioneer,
          then eir bids must be made publically. Otherwise, bidders may
          bid either publically, or privately to the Auctioneer.

      (c) End of Auction: the Auction shall end one week after it
          begins.

      (d) The Final Auction Price is either:
          (1) The amount of the largest nonwinning uncancelled valid
              bid, if there were more than N valid uncancelled bids in
              the Auction; or
          (2) the Starting Bid, if there were N or fewer valid
              uncancelled bids.
          For the purpose of this Rule, N is equal to the number of
          items being Auctioned.

      The Auctioneer and eir Executor must treat all bids made in a
      Vickrey Auction as secret while the Auction is in progress. Other
      players, however, are free to reveal as much about their bidding
      as they wish.


Amend Rule 1984 (Raffles) to read:

      There is a type of Auction called a Raffle. The Auction Procedure
      for a Raffle is the same as the Default Auction Procedure, with
      the following modifications:

      (a) Auctioneer: the Auctioneer is known as the Riff-Raff.

      (b) Start of Raffle: the Raffle begins when the first
          announcement that a Raffle has begun is made by a Player
          authorized to initiate the Raffle. The announcement must
          contain:
          (1) the identity of the Riff-Raff;
          (2) the Raffle Currency;
          (3) the number of items, N, being Raffled; and
          (4) the Ticket Price, a multiple of the MUQ of the Raffle
              Currency.

      (c) Ticket Price: all tickets shall have the same Ticket Price.
          If not otherwise specified, the Ticket Price shall be equal
          to the MUQ of the Raffle Currency.

      (d) Buying tickets: an entrant buys a ticket by paying a Fee equal
          to the Ticket Price to the Bank, provided that the purchase is
          not made before the start of the Auction, or after its end.
          Each entrant may buy as many tickets as e likes during the
          Auction.

      (e) End of Raffle: the Raffle ends if any of the following occur:
          (1) one week has passed from the start of the Raffle, and no
              tickets have been purchased; or
          (2) a ticket has been purchased in the Raffle, and 72 hours
              have passed without another ticket being purchased in the
              Raffle;
          (3) 14 days have passed since the Raffle began.

      (f) Winning tickets: When the Raffle ends, the Riff-Raff shall
          randomly determine N valid Raffle tickets to be winning
          tickets. Each Raffle ticket has one chance to win, and
          multiple Raffle tickets bought by the same entrant may win.
          If there were less than N valid Raffle tickets, then all
          valid Raffle tickets are winning tickets.

      (g) Announcing winners: as soon as possible after the end of the
          Raffle, the Riff-Raff shall announce the winning tickets.
          Upon this announcement, the owner of the Auctioned items
          shall incur a debt of one Auctioned lot of items to each
          winning entrant for each of eir winning tickets.

      (h) Riff-Raff's Gratuity: within a week after the end of the
          Raffle, the Riff-Raff may pay out to emself the Ticket Price
          in the Raffle Currency if:
          (1) the Raffle had at least three separate winning entrants,
              not including the Riff-Raff; and
          (2) the Riff-Raff has not already done so for that Raffle.
