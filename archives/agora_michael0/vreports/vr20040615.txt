[All votes on the Ordinary Proposals were ineffective; Rule 1950(d)(1)
requires the voter to actually be a Shareholder; a VPOP left over from
the Oligarchy is insufficient.  All declarations of presence on the
Ordinary Proposals were also ineffective; Rule 1715 does not allow
declarations of presence on Ordinary Proposals.  Murphy, Riail,
Sherlock,
and root missed the end of 4583's Voting Period, so Elysion gets a
sole-dissenter bonus after all, but no one gets Contested Proposal
bonuses because it failed quorum.  Sherlock's VPDP increased from 1 to 2
mid-Voting Period, so eir second votes on 4579 and 4582 were
ineffective.]

Text of Adopted Proposals
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 4579 by Murphy, AI=2, Democratic
Judicial Tweaks


Amend Rule 911 (The Board of Appeals) by changing "random selection"
to "selection".

Amend Rule 2024 (Linked Statements) by appending this text:

      If a Trial Judge is recused from a Linked CFJ, then it ceases
      to be Linked to any other CFJ.  If a Trial Judge is recused
      from two or more Linked CFJs in a single message, then those
      CFJs continue to be Linked to each other, but not to any other
      CFJs to which the Judge is still assigned.

Amend Rule 2032 (Errors in Judge Selection) by replacing this text:

      then that selection shall stand and the selected Player shall
      become a Judge of that CFJ or Appeal, as if e had been eligible
      to judge it.

with this text:

      then that selection shall stand and the selected Player shall
      become a Judge of that CFJ or Appeal, as if e had been eligible
      to judge it; unless the Clerk of the Courts points out eir
      error and makes a new selection before the selected Player
      returns Judgement.

Change the title of Rule 2035 (The Unready are Ineligible) to
"The Unready and Unnoisy are Ineligible", and amend it to read:

      While a player is unready, e is ineligible to be Judge of any
      CFJ.

      While a player is not noisy, e is ineligible to become Judge
      of any CFJ.

Proposal 4582 by Murphy, AI=3.01, Democratic
Sweeping it under the rug, take three


Create a rule with Power=3.01 and this text:

      Upon the creation of this rule, the Gamestate becomes what it
      would have been if Steve's Voting Power on Democratic Proposals
      had been continuously equal to 2 from October 1, 2003, at 00:00:00
      UTC, to November 30, 2003, at 23:59:59 UTC.  In particular, this
      ensures that the following proposals have been adopted and have
      taken effect:

           4532     Clean Up Oligarchy Removal
           4533     Bolshevik Revolution of 2003, with Glasnost
           4534     Clean Up Oligarchy Removal, take 2
           4540     Boon of Zeitgeist
           4542     Pragmatize Scoring

      One second after the creation of this rule, this rule is repealed.
