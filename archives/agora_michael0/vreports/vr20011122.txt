Proposal #4228 by root, AI=1
Keep the Mapkeepor Unignorant

/*
** Rule 2005 currently doesn't require Tollers to inform the Mapkeepor
** when they impose or remove Tolls, which could create a problem when
** the Mapkeepor must verify the correctness of a Toll.  This Proposal
** fixes that problem.
*/

{

Amend Rule 2005 by replacing the text reading:

       A Player who owns Land may impose a Toll on any (currently
       un-Tolled) piece of Land e owns.  To do so, e must pay a Fee of
       0.2 Indulgences and clearly and unambiguously identify the Unit
       of Land in question, as well as the amount of the Toll for that
       Unit of Land.

with text reading:

       A Player who owns Land may impose a Toll on any (currently
       un-Tolled) piece of Land e owns.  To do so, e must pay a Fee of
       0.2 Indulgences and publicly announce that e is imposing a Toll,
       clearly and unambiguously identifying the Unit of Land in
       question, as well as the amount of the Toll for that Unit of
       Land.

and by replacing the text reading:

       A Player may remove a Toll from any Tolled Unit of Land e owns.
       If a Player loses possession of a Unit of Land, all Tolls
       imposed on that Unit by that Player are removed.

with text reading:

       A Player may remove a Toll from any Tolled Unit of Land e owns
       by publicly announcing that e does so.  If a Player loses
       possession of a Unit of Land, all Tolls imposed on that Unit by
       that Player are removed.

Proposal #4229 by Goethe, AI=1
Manifesting Destiny 1.1

In Rule 2003 (Moving in Arcadia) replace the following text:

       * 0.10 probability it becomes Wilderness/Mountains;
       * 0.20 probability it becomes Wilderness/Hills;
       * 0.20 probability it becomes Wilderness/Forest;
       * 0.10 probability it becomes Wilderness/Desert;
       * 0.10 probability it becomes Farmland, no subtype;
       * 0.30 probability it becomes Water, no subtype.

with:
       * 0.15 probability it becomes the same type and subtype
              as the land at the location of the exploring Player;
       * 0.10 probability it becomes Wilderness/Mountains;
       * 0.20 probability it becomes Wilderness/Hills;
       * 0.20 probability it becomes Wilderness/Forest;
       * 0.10 probability it becomes Wilderness/Desert;
       * 0.05 probability it becomes Farmland, no subtype;
       * 0.20 probability it becomes Water, no subtype.
