Proposal #4277 by OscarMeyr, AI=1
Make Insanity More Interesting (v2.1)

// A Player may not split votes on Insane Proposals.
// Inserts stanza 3 into the rule on Insanity

Change R1729 to read as follows:

      An Interested Proposal is Insane, if it contains no minuscule
         letter.
      (That is the opposite of CAPITAL, for those who know not
         better.)

      For such a Proposal, until the Voting Period has ended:
      there shall be no discussing Votes, or this Rule has been
         bended.
      Nor shall a Player Vote in public, only to Assessor.
      The Votes shall be unknown to others, even employer and
         professor.

      And should a Player split eir votes 'tween FOR and
          AGAINST like crazy,
      E will annoy Assessors (who are known for being lazy)
      So should eir votes cast differ from each other, this Rule's
          broke,
      With the breaker being the voting Player, as sure as if e'd
          spoke.

      And should such a Proposal's Voting Period begin,
      but no one Votes FOR it, the Proposer shall Win.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal #4278 by harvel, AI=2
Cold Storage

[Introduces "frozen" as a third activity level, to go along with
 "active" and "inactive".  Freezing oneself allows a player to take an
 extended break from the game without leaving it entirely.  A player may
 always reduce eir activity level; increasing eir activity level may not
 always be done right away.

 This proposal modifies the following Rules (all of these are amended;
 if a Rule's title is changed, it is marked with `[*]'):

    * Rule  559 (The Registrar)
    * Rule  698 (Always an Eligible Judge)
    * Rule  879 (Quorum)
    * Rule  911 (The Board of Appeals)
    * Rule 1016 (Putting Oneself On Hold) [*]
    * Rule 1023 (Definition of "As Soon As Possible")
    * Rule 1042 (Deregistration Due to Silence)
    * Rule 1375 (Speaker Going On Hold)
    * Rule 1555 (Electees and Removal from Office)
    * Rule 1568 (Judges On Hold) [*]
    * Rule 1599 (Overdue Debts)
    * Rule 1827 (Granting or Denying Motions)
    * Rule 1841 (Granting Power of Attorney)
    * Rule 1887 (Default Procedure for Auctions)
    * Rule 1963 (Eligible Oligarchs)
    * Rule 1983 (Vickrey Auctions)
    * Rule 1984 (Raffles)

 This proposal creates no Rules.

 This proposal repeals one Rule:

    * Rule 1584 (Absolvement of Duty for On Hold Players)]


Amend Rule 1016 (Putting Oneself On Hold) to read:

      Each player has an activity level, which is always exactly one of
      active, inactive, and frozen.  A player's activity level may not
      be modified except by methods described explicitly in the rules.

      This rule takes precedence over each rule that regulates activity
      levels and the powers or duties that a player may have because of
      eir activity level.

      An activity level of active is higher than any other activity
      level.  An activity level of inactive is higher than an activity
      level of frozen.

      Whenever a player registers or reregisters, e becomes active.

      A player may lower eir activity level by announcing that e does so
      and indicating eir new activity level, unless the rules do not
      permit that player to change to that activity level.  If the
      player becomes inactive in this way, e may not become active until
      at least 96 hours after e last become inactive.

      An inactive player may become active by announcing that e does so,
      unless the rules do not permit that player to become active.

      A frozen player who has been frozen for at least 90 days may
      increase eir activity level by announcing that e does so and
      indicating eir new activity level, unless the rules do not permit
      that player to change to that activity level.

      "Off hold" and "on hold" are unambiguous synonyms for "active" and
      "inactive", respectively.  "put in cold storage" is an unambiguous
      synonym for "frozen".

      Only active players may vote, make proposals, or hold office.
      Inactive players may not be required by the rules to perform any
      duty or action unless the rules explicitly state that they can
      require inactive players to perform that duty or action.  Frozen
      players may not be required by the rules to perform any duty or
      action.


Change the title of Rule 1016 to "Activity Levels".


Repeal Rule 1584 (Absolvement of Duty for On Hold Players).


Amend Rule 1555 (Electees and Removal from Office) by replacing the text
that reads:

      If a Player goes On Hold, deregisters, or is deregistered, e is
      removed from all Offices e holds.

with text that reads:

      Whenever a player deregisters, is deregistered, or ceases to be
      active, e is removed from all Offices e holds.


Amend Rule 1963 (Eligible Oligarchs) by replacing the text that reads:

      e is On Hold;

with text that reads:

      e is not active;


[This will have to be modified if Murphy's Jailor proposal passes.]

Amend Rule 1568 (Judges On Hold) to read:

      A player who ceases to be active while selected as the judge of
      one or more calls for judgement (CFJs) commits the infraction of
      Judge Inactivity.  This infraction is to be reported by the Clerk
      of the Courts, and has a penalty of 0.1 Indulgences for each CFJs
      for which the player was selected as judge when e ceased to be
      active.

Change the title of Rule 1568 to "Non-Active Judges".


Amend Rule 1827 (Granting or Denying Motions) by replacing the text that
reads:

      If a Motion is made after a case is closed, and the original Judge
      of that case is no longer a Player or is On Hold, then a new Judge
      shall be assigned to the case as usual.

with text that reads:

      If a Motion is made after a case is closed, and the original Judge
      of that case is not active or is not a player, then a new Judge
      shall be assigned to the case as usual.


Amend Rule 911 (The Board of Appeals) by inserting immediately after the
text that reads:

        v) E is on Hold, and this restriction does not prevent three
           eligible Players from being selected by the CotC for the
           Board.

text that reads:

       vi) E is frozen.


Amend Rule 1599 (Overdue Debts) by replacing the text that reads:

      if the debtor's Executor is on Hold at the time the demand is
      sent, the debtor shall instead have seven days from when the
      debtor's Executor comes off Hold to satisfy the debt.

with text that reads:

      if the debtor's Executor is not active at the time the demand is
      sent, the debtor shall instead have seven days from the time eir
      Executor becomes active to satisfy the debt.


Amend each of Rule 1887 (Default Procedure for Auctions), Rule 1983
(Vickrey Auctions), and Rule 1984 (Raffles), by replacing each instance
of the text that reads:

      On Hold status

with text that reads:

      Activity


[This will have to be modified if Murphy's Jailor proposal passes.]

Amend Rule 1375 (Speaker Going On Hold) to read:

      A Speaker who ceases to be active while e is still Speaker commits
      the class 10 crime of Speaker Inactivity.

      Whenever the Speaker is not active, a Speaker Transition occurs.


Amend Rule 1841 (Granting Power of Attorney) by replacing the text that
reads:

      the Holder is deregistered or goes On Hold; or

with text that reads:

      the Holder ceases to be active or is deregistered; or


Amend Rule 1023 (Definition of "As Soon As Possible") by replacing the
text that reads:

      Other Rules may grant extensions of the penalty-free period to
      Inactive Players without conflicting with this Rule.

with text that reads:

      Other Rules may grant extensions of the penalty-free period to
      non-active players.


Amend Rule 1042 (Deregistration Due to Silence) by replacing the text
that reads:

      Whenever a player has been Quiet continuously for two weeks or has
      been Inactive continuously for two months, e becomes Silent.

with text that reads:

      Whenever a player has been Quiet continuously for two weeks,
      Inactive continuously for two months, or Frozen continuously for
      two years, e becomes Silent.


[I don't have to change much in this rule, but it's easiest to make the
 changes by rewriting the whole rule.  For reference:

Rule 879/14 (Power=2)
Quorum

      An Ordinary Proposal achieves Quorum if at least three
      Oligarchs cast votes on it.

      A Democratic Proposal achieves Quorum if:
      (1) at least one-third of all Active Noisy Players, or
      (2) at least one-fifth of all Players
      cast votes on it. Quorum for a Democratic Proposal shall be
      determined from the number of Players and number of Active Noisy
      Players at the time that the Proposal was distributed, or at the
      time it was made a Democratic Proposal, whichever is later.]

Amend Rule 879 (Quorum) to read:

      An ordinary proposal achieves quorum if at least three oligarchs
      cast votes on it.

      A democratic proposal achieves quorum if:
      (1) at least one third of all active noisy players, or
      (2) at least one fifth of all non-frozen players
      cast votes on it.  Quorum for a democratic proposal shall be
      determined from the number of non-frozen players and number of
      active noisy players at the time that the proposal was
      distributed, or at the time it was made a democratic proposal,
      whichever is later.


[I don't think Rule 1434 (Default Procedure for Referendum Voting) needs
 to be modified.  It says, among other things:

      * Voters: Only Active Players may Vote on a Referendum.  Activity
      is measured at the time a Player sends eir Vote.]


Amend Rule 698 (Always an Eligible Judge) by replacing the text that
reads:

      If this still does not result in there being any Players eligible
      to judge, then all Players (Active or not), excluding the Caller
      and those Players Barred by the Caller, shall be eligible.

      If this still does not result in there being any Players eligible
      to judge, then all Players, excluding the Caller, shall be
      eligible.

      If this still does not result in there being any Players eligible
      to judge, and the Caller is a Player, then the Caller shall be
      eligible.

      If this still does not result in there being any Players eligible
      to judge, then the Caller has happened across an Agora without any
      Players.  The Rules suggest that the Caller try calling at a later
      date.

with text that reads:

      If this still does not result in there being any players eligible
      to judge, then all non-frozen players, excluding the Caller and
      those players barred by the Caller, shall be eligible.

      If this still does not result in there being any players eligible
      to judge, then all non-frozen players, excluding the
      Caller, shall be eligible.

      If this still does not result in there being any players eligible
      to judge, and the Caller is a player, then the Caller shall be
      eligible.

      If this still does not result in there being any players eligible
      to judge, then the Caller has happened across an Agora that is a
      generational ship whose members are in suspended animation.  The
      Rules suggest that the Caller try calling when we arrive at our
      destination and begin to thaw out.


Amend Rule 559 (The Registrar) by replacing the text that reads:

        (v) each player's Active/Inactive status, and the most recent
            date on which that player became Active or Inactive;

with text that reads:

        (v) each player's activity level, and the most recent date on
            which that player's activity level changed;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal #4279 by harvel, AI=2
Fix Dependent Actions

Amend Rule 1728 (Dependent Actions) to read:

      An action is dependent, or may be performed dependently, if and
      only if it is an Action Without N Objections or an Action With N
      Supporters, where N is a positive integer.  The phrase "Without
      Objection" is synonymous with "Without 1 Objection", and the phrase
      "With Support" is synonymous with "With 1 Supporter".

      A player may publicly announce eir intent to perform an
      unambiguously described dependent action.  A player may perform a
      previously unambiguously described dependent action if and only
      if:

      (a)  no more than fourteen days have passed since the announcement
           of intent to perform the action;

      (b)  if the action to be performed is an Action Without N
           Objections, at least four days have passed since the
           announcement made under (a) of this rule;

      (c)  either the player who attempts to perform the action is the
           player who made the announcement under (a) of this rule, or

           (1)  the player who made the announcement under (a) of this
                rule did so by a privilege or duty granted em by
                virtue of holding a rules-defined position; and

           (2)  the player who attempts to perform the action is the
                holder of that position when e attempts to perform the
                action;

      (d)  the rules explicitly authorise the player to perform the
           action dependently;

      (e)  during the time between the announcement made under (a) of
           this rule and the attempt to perform the action,

           (1)  if the action is to be performed Without N Objections,
                fewer than N players have publicly posted objections to
                the performance of the action; or

           (2)  if the action is to be performed With N Supporters, at
                least N players other than the player who made the
                announcement under (a) of this rule have publicly posted
                support for the performance of the action;

      (f)  the announcement made under (a) of this rule specifies
           whether the action is to be performed Without N Objections or
           With N Supporters, unless the rules either do not permit the
           action to be performed Without N Objections or do not permit
           the action to be performed With N Supporters; and

      (g)  e announces that e performs the described action.

      A dependent action is not performed until announced as in (g).

      A player who posts an objection to the performance of an action
      may publicly retract eir objection.  If e does so, e shall be
      deemed not have posted an objection to the performance of that
      action for the purposes of (e)(1) of this rule.

      The specification in the rules that an action may be performed
      dependently does not prohibit performing that action independently
      if doing so would otherwise be permissible.

      A rule authorising the performance of a dependent action may
      restrict the eligibility of players to support or object to that
      specific action.

Organizations Can Move, Too!

// Organizations can move 5 Movement Units per week

Change the first paragraph of Rule 2003 from:

      Every week, each Player may expend up to 10 Movement Units to
      move about in the Land of Arcadia.  Movement Units are not
      transferrable, and do not persist from one week to the next.
To:

     Every week, each Player may expend up to 10 Movement Units to

      The Mapkeepor's Report shall list, for each Player:
        * the Player's location at the beginning of the last week
