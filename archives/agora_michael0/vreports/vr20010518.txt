root's declaration of presence on proposal 4155 is an interesting case. As
e wasn't registered at the time the proposal was distributed, eir voting
power on the proposal was 0. This doesn't stop em from declaring presence
(R1715). Because rule 879 appears to define quorum in such a way that the
number of players at the time a proposal is distributed is taken into
consideration, but the identity of them isn't, root's declaration of
presence was succesful. Of course, this point is of academic interest
only, since proposal 4155 would have achieved quorum even without root's
presence.

Points awards:

harvel: 2 (1 vote AGAINST 4155)
Elysion: 2 (only vote AGAINST 4155)

Text of Adopted Proposals
======================================================================

Proposal #4154 by harvel, AI=1
Keep it Quiet

Be it hereby resolved, that Rule 1042 (Zombification Due to Silence) be
amended to read:

        Each Player is always Noisy, Quiet, or Silent, but never more
        than one of these.  Whenever a Player posts to a Public Forum,
        or a new Player registers, that Player is Noisy.

        Any Player who has not caused another Player to become Quiet
        within the last 24 hours can cause another Active Noisy Player
        to become Quiet by stating that e is doing so, and clearly
        identifying that Player, in a Public Forum.  If a Player has
        been Quiet continuously for two weeks, e becomes Silent.  If a
        Player has been Inactive continuously for two months, e becomes
        Silent.

        Any Player can make a Silent Player a Zombie by publicly
        alleging that the Silent Player has abandoned the game.  A Player
        has abandoned the game if and only if e is Silent.  As soon as
        possible after a public allegation that a Player has abandoned
        the game, the Registrar shall publicly confirm or deny that the
        Player is a Zombie.

        If a Speaker has abandoned the game, e commits the Class 15 Crime of
        Speaker Abandonment, to be detected and reported by any Player.
        E ceases to be Speaker, and the Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker.
        The previous Speaker then becomes a Zombie.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal #4155 by harvel, AI=2
Help New Players

Be it hereby resolved, that Rule 869 (Registered Players) be amended to
read:

        Any person who is not registered as a Player may do so by
        sending a message to a Public Forum stating that e registers
        as a Player.  Unless other Rules provide additional necessary
        conditions for registration that have not been fulfilled or
        the Rules otherwise prohibit the person from registering, e
        immediately becomes a registered Player.

        Each Player is always either Ready or Unready, but not both.
        A Player is Ready unless the Rules state otherwise.  If a
        Player is Unready, e may become Ready by announcing that e
        does so.

        Whenever a person registers as a Player in Agora, and that
        person has not been registered as a Player in Agora at any
        time within the 12 previous months, e becomes Unready and
        is subject to a Grace Period that begins at the time of eir
        registration and ends two months afterwards.  A Player is only
        subject to the Grace Period resulting from eir own registration.

        Whenever a Player's Grace Period ends, e becomes Ready.


Be it further resolved, that Rule 559 (The Registrar) be amended to read:

        There exists the Office of Registrar, whose responsibility it is
        to maintain a list of Players.

        The Registrar's Report shall include all of the following
        information:

           (i)  a list of all registered Players, with their nicknames,
                if any, and preferred email addresses;

          (ii)  a list of all Grace Periods in progress, including
                the Player subject to the Grace Period, the time at which
                it started, and the time at which it will end;

         (iii)  a list of all Unready Players;

          (iv)  a list of Players who are Zombies, and who their Masters
                are;

           (v)  the most recent date on which each Player registered;

          (vi)  each Player's Active/Inactive status, and the most recent
                date on which that Player became Active or Inactive;

         (vii)  each Player's Noisy/Quiet/Silent status, and the most
                recent date on which that Player became Noisy, Quiet, or
                Silent; and

        (viii)  the identities of the Distributor and the Speaker (and eir
                Term of Service).


Be it further resolved, that Rule 698 (Always an Eligible Judge) be amended
to read:

        Every Active Player is eligible to judge a given Call for
        Judgement (CFJ) unless specifically made ineligible by some Rule.

        Whenever a Player becomes subject to a Grace Period, e becomes
        ineligible to judge CFJs.

        The Caller of a given CFJ is never eligible to judge that CFJ.

        If, after taking all other Rules affecting eligibility into account,
        there are no Players eligible to judge a CFJ, then all Active
Players,
        excluding the Caller and those Players Barred by the Caller, shall
be
        eligible, any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

        If this still does not result in there being any Players eligible
        to judge, then all Players (Active or not), excluding the Caller and
        those Players Barred by the Caller, shall be eligible.

        If this still does not result in there being any Players eligible
        to judge, then all Players, excluding the Caller, shall be eligible.

        If this still does not result in there being any Players eligible
        to judge, and the Caller is a Player, then the Caller shall be
        eligible.

        If this still does not result in there being any Players eligible
        to judge, then the Caller has happened across an Agora without
        any Players.  The Rules suggest that the Caller try calling at a
        later date.

        This Rule can require On Hold Players to perform actions.

        This Rule takes precedence over any Rule or combination of
        Rules which would result in there being no Players eligible to
        Judge a given CFJs.


Be it further resolved, that Rule 786 (Order of Succession for
Speaker-Elect) be amended by replacing the text "the Speaker does not
appear"
with the text "neither the Speaker nor any Unready Player appears".


Be it further resolved, that Rule 908 (Formal Apologies) be amended by
replacing the text reading:

        Upon a judicial finding that a Player (herein called the Ninny)
        has acted or has failed to act in such a way as to be in
        violation of one or more Rules, the Judge so finding shall Order
        that Player to submit, within 72 hours, a Formal Apology.
        However, when the action (or failure to act) is subject to
        penalties by virtue of being defined to be a Crime or an
        Infraction, the Order is optional and may be issued at the
        Judge's discretion.

with text reading:

        If a Call for Judgement (CFJ) the Statement of which alleges that
        a Player (herein called the Ninny) has acted or has failed to
        act in such a way as to be in violation of one or more Rules is
        judged TRUE, then the Judge so finding may Order that Player to
        submit, within 72 hours, a Formal Apology.  If the Ninny is Ready
        and the act or failure to act is not subject to penalties by
        virtue of being defined to be a Crime or an Infraction, then the
        Judge must issue such an Order as soon as possible after the
        Clerk of the Courts publishes the judgement.


Be it further resolved, that Rule 1435 (Definition of Indulgences, Blots
and Immaculate) be amended by replacing the text "The MUQ of Indulgences"
with the text "The Minimum Unit Quantity (MUQ) of Indulgences", and by
replacing the text reading:

        Whenever the Rules state that a Player gains or is assessed
        some number of Blots, and specify a method of reporting that
        gain or assessment to the Herald, the Herald shall record this
        increase in the number of Blots staining the affected Player as
        soon as possible after receiving the notification.

with text reading:

        Whenever the Rules state that a Player gains or is assessed some
        number of Blots, and specify a method of reporting that gain or
        assessment to the Herald, then, as soon as possible after
        receiving such a notification, the Herald shall record an
        increase of that amount (or, if the affected Player is Unready,
        of one half (rounded to the nearest integer) of that amount) in
        the number of Blots staining the affected Player.


Be it further resolved, that Rule 1893 (The Treasuror's Budget) be amended
to read:

        The Treasuror's Budget shall contain the Basic Officer Salary
        (BOS), an amount between 0 and 200 Stems inclusive.  Additionally,
        the Budget shall contain the values all of the following
        compensations:

          (i)  the Minimum Income;
         (ii)  the Judicial Salary;
        (iii)  the Winner's Stipend;
         (iv)  the Distributor's Gratuity;
          (v)  the Speaker's Gratuity; and
         (vi)  for each wage-earning Office, the Salary of that Office.

        A compensation shall be not less than 0 nor more than 4, and must
        be an integral multiple of 0.1.  The arithmetic mean of all
        compensations shall be no greater than 2.

        Whenever the Rules indicate that one of the above compensations
        is to be paid out, the amount to be paid out shall be the product
        of the value of the compensation and the value of the BOS (as
        set in the latest Budget).

        The Treasuror's Budget shall also contain a schedule that, for
        each Bank Currency, shall indicate the amount of the New Player
        Award for that Currency.  The amount of the New Player Award
        for a Bank Currency shall not be less than the Minimum Unit
        Quantity of that Currency.

        While holding the Office as Electee, the Treasuror may amend eir
        Budget, With Support.


Be it further resolved, that the Treasuror's Budget be modified by
including the value of the New Player Award for each Bank Currency,
according to the following schedule:

        --------------------  ----------------
        Indulgences              1.0 Indulgences
        Papyri                   1.0 Papyri
        Stems                  120   Stems
        Voting Entitlements      0.5 Voting Entitlements


Be it further resolved, that Rule 1677 (Currency Awards for New Players)
be amended to read:

        the Registrar shall Order the Treasuror to pay out the New Player
        Award for each Bank Currency to the new Player.

        Whenever the Rules indicate that the Bank incurs a debt to an
        entity equal to the New Player Award, the Bank shall instead
        incur for each Bank Currency a debt to that entity equal to the
        New Player Award for that Currency.


Be it further resolved, that Rule 1676 (Grace Period for New Players) be
repealed.


Be it further resolved, that all Players in their Grace Period at the time
this Proposal is adopted shall immediately become Unready.


Be it further resolved, that as soon as possible after this Proposal is

Proposal #4156 by Ian, AI=1
Pragmatic Currencies, at last

[
This Proposal will:
* delete the platonic provision (3) from R1598;
* make it a Class 10 Crime to intentionally make valid but unauthorized
  transfers of Property from any entity to another entity;
* ensure that the beneficiary of any such transfer is required to return
  the Property received;
* make it a Class 10 Crime not to do so;
* clarify the concept of an "authorized transfer";
* amend R1596 to generally require the recipient of an unauthorized
  transfer to return the Property transferred to em.
* give transferors the right to demand the return of Property
  transferred in error (ie to satisfy a non-existent debt, or to pay a
  Fee when the action associated with it is not successfully performed.
]

Amend Rule 1598 (Property Transfers) to read:

      (a) A Notice of Transfer is a message which sets forth the intent
          to transfer one or more Properties from one entity (the
          "transferor") to some other entity (the "transferee").

      (b) A valid Notice of Transfer must additionally:
          (1) specify one or more Properties all of which are owned by
              the transferor; and
          (2) be sent by the Executor of the transferor, or by a Limited
              Executor of the transferor with the authority to execute
              transfers on behalf of that entity with respect to all of
              the Properties involved.

      (c) A transfer of a Property occurs only when its Recordkeepor
          receives a valid Notice of Transfer.

      (d) The effect of a transfer of Properties is to cause the
          transferor to cease to possess the Properties transferred, and
          simultaneously to cause the transferee to possess them.

      (e) The Recordkeepor of a Property shall maintain a record of all
          transfers of that Property. E shall retain a record of each
          Notice of Transfer which e receives (whether valid or not)
          involving that Property. E shall retain this record of each
          Notice of Transfer for at least four weeks after its receipt.

      (f) If the transferor transfers Property to the transferee with
          the purpose of satisfying a debt, or of paying the Fee
          associated with performing an action, but the debt does not
          exist, or the action is not successfully performed, then the
          transferor's Executor may publicly demand the return of the
          Property. The effect of such a demand is to cause the
          transferee to incur a debt to the transferor for the Property
          transferred.


Create a Rule entitled "Embezzlement and Receiving Stolen Property",
with the following text:

      (a) A Player who intentionally makes a valid but unauthorized
          transfer of Property from any entity to another entity commits
          the Class 10 Crime of Embezzlement.

      (b) An entity which receives Property from any entity as the result
          of an intentional, valid and unauthorized transfer incurs a
          debt to the Bank for all such Property.

      (c) A Player who has been informed that e, or an entity of which e
          is an Executor, has incurred a debt of the type decribed in
          (b) and who does not act to satisfy that debt within in a week
          of being informed of it commits the Class 10 Crime of
          Receiving Stolen Property.

      (d) For the the purposes of this Rule, a valid but unauthorized
          transfer is considered to have been made intentionally if and
          only if, at the time of the transfer, the Player making it:
          (1) knew that the transfer was valid;
          (2) knew that the transfer was unauthorized; and
          (3) realized that e was making the transfer.

      (e) In particular, a Player who makes a valid but unauthorized
          transfer of Property from the Bank as the result of an
          accident or mistake does not commit Embezzlement.


Amend Rule 1470 (The Bank) to read:

      (a) There is an entity known as the Bank. The Bank has Mint
          Authority. The Bank is the Mintor of each Bank Currency.

      (b) The Executor of the Bank is the Treasuror. Each Recordkeepor
          of each Bank Currency is a Limited Executor of the Bank.

      (c) The Executor of the Bank, and each Limited Executor, is
          authorized to transfer Property from the Bank as and when the
          Rules explicitly require or permit it. Transfers of Property
          from the Bank which are made without being explicitly required
          or permitted by the Rules are unauthorized.

      (d) Whenever the Bank incurs a debt to any other entity, the Bank
          shall, as soon as possible and by its Executor or by one of
          its Limited Executors, either satisfy that debt by
          transferring appropriate Properties to the creditor, or
          dispute the debt by whatever means are appropriate in the
          situation.

      (e) The Treasuror has sole authority to forgive debts owed to the
          Bank, in whole or in part. This power may only be exercised:
          (1) pursuant to a properly-issued Order; or
          (2) Without Objection, at the Treasuror's discretion.


Amend Rule 1596 (Debt) to read:

      (a) A "debt" is an obligation arising under the Rules for one
          entity (the "debtor") to make a transfer of one or more
          Properties to some other entity (the "creditor").

      (b) No debt shall be enforceable unless a notice sufficient to
          inform the debtor of the debt has been sent to the debtor. If
          a Rule requires that a public notice of a debt be posted, the
          debt is not enforceable until and unless that notice is
          posted.

      (c) A debt is satisfied when the debtor has transferred (or is
          deemed to have transferred) all the Properties named to the
          creditor (either as a single transfer or as the aggregate of
          multiple transfers).

      (d) A debt is forgiven when the creditor of a debt sends a notice
          to the debtor that e is forgiving the debt. Forgiveness may be
          for the entire debt or for any part thereof. The effect
          forgiving a debt is as if the debtor had made a payment on the
          debt for the portion forgiven, except that no transfer of
          property takes place thereby.

      (e) An entity which receives Property as the result of an
          unauthorized transfer incurs a debt for the transferred
          Property to the entity that made the transfer.
