because it was not Interested.)  If it did exist, then all votes on it were
ineffective due to lack of VPDP.

Proposal 4755 by Manu, AI=2, Democratic, Sane
Agoran Contracts


Create a new Rule entitled "Agoran Contracts" which reads as follow:

       There exists a type of Contract known as Agoran Contract. An
       Agoran Contract is a Contract between any two entities. An
       Agoran Contract may only be created or amended by a Proposal and
       becomes effective when the Proposal takes effect. Unless
       otherwise specified in the Rules or Regulations, All Players are
       automatically Members of Agoran Contracts and no Player may
       leave an Agoran Contract.

       All Rules regulating Contracts that are inconsistent with this
       Rule are superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.

       The ADoP is required to keep track of all Agoran Contracts.
