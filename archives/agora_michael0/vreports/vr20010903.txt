Proposal #4206 by neil, AI=1
Bond Fraud and Moratoria

Enact the following rule, entitled `Bond Fraud':
      A Player who sells to the Bank a Bond issued by an entity:
       * of which e is an Executor, which e is in collusion with, or
         an Executor of which e is in collusion with, and
       * that e believes will not, at the date of maturity, or does
         not, if the Bond is already mature, have funds to cover
         redemption of said Bond,
      commits the Class 5 Crime of Bond Fraud.  If it is judged that a
      player has committed Bond Fraud, the Judge shall order that all
      unlawful gains from said instance of Bond Fraud be disgorged.

      If the Executor of the issuer of a Bond used to commit Bond
      Fraud is not the Player who was charged with Bond Fraud, and
      said Executor knew that the Bond in question would be used for
      such a purpose, e commits the Class 4 Crime of Conspiracy to
      Commit Bond Fraud.

Amend Rule 1979 (Treasuror's Moratorium on Bond Purchases) to read:
      The Treasuror may, with Support, place or remove a moratorium on
      bond purchases in any specific Bank currency.  Once a moratorium
      has been placed, the Bank may not purchase any Bonds with a face
      value in that currency, until that moratorium is removed.

      The Treasuror must report any moratoria currently in place in
      eir Monthly Report.

Remove the moratorium on Bond purchases.
Place a moratorium on Bond purchases in Stems.
Place a moratorium on Bond purchases in VEs.
Place a moratorium on Bond purchases in Papyri.
Place a moratorium on Bond purchases in Indulgences.

Proposal #4207 by neil, AI=1
Moving in Agora

Create a rule with title ``Moving in Arcadia'' and text:

  Every week, each Player may expend up to 10 Movement Units to move
  about in the Land of Arcadia.  Movement Units are not transferrable,
  and do not persist from one week to the next.

  A player makes a Move by notifying the Mapkeepor of the location
  (the Destination) into which e is attempting to move.  If the Player
  has enough Movement Units left this week, and the Move is valid, the
  Player's Location is changed to the Destination.  So long as e does
  not spend more than eir allotted number of Movement Units, a Player
  may move as many times as e wishes in a single week.
  
  The Mapkeepor's Report shall list, for each Player:
    * the Player's location at the beginning of the last week
    * the Player's location at the beginning of the current week

  Players may expend:
    * 10 Movement Units to move into an adjacent unit of Type
      Wilderness, Subtype Mountains.
    *  5 Movement Units to move into an adjacent unit of Type
      Wilderness, Subtype Hills.
    *  3 Movement Units to move into an adjacent unit of Type
      Wilderness, Subtype Forest or Desert.
    *  3 Movement Units to move into an adjacent unit of Type
      Wilderness with no Subtype.
    *  2 Movement Units to move into an adjacent unit of Type
      Farmland.
    *  1 Movement Unit to move into an adjacent unit of Type Urbana.

  A player may also expend 10 Movement Units to Explore, by notifying
  the Mapkeepor that e does so.  If a Player Explores, all units of
  Aether within a Penguin Distance of 2 from the Player's current
  location are assigned a new Land Type and possibly Subtype.  For
  each unit of Aether affected, there is a:
   * 0.10 probability it becomes Winderness/Mountains;
   * 0.20 probability it becomes Winderness/Hills;
   * 0.20 probability it becomes Winderness/Forest;
   * 0.10 probability it becomes Winderness/Desert;
   * 0.10 probability it becomes Farmland, no subtype;
   * 0.30 probability it becomes Water, no subtype.

  The random choice of new Land Type and Subtype is to be made by the
  Mapkeepor.  Affected units take on the new Land Type at the
  beginning of the next week, and all such changes shall be indicated
  in the Mapkeepor's Report for that week.

  Moves explicitly allowed by this Rule, including Exploring, are valid,
  unless made invalid by other Rules.  Unless explicity permitted by other
  Rules, all other Moves are invalid.
