Text of Adopted Proposals
======================================================================

Proposal 4181 by Murphy, AI=1
Simplify Organizations

Amend Rule 1528 (Organizations) to read:

      An Organization is an entity designated as such by the Rules.

      Each Organization shall have the following properties:

        a) A Name.
        b) A Class.
        c) A Charter.
        d) An Administrator.
        e) One or more Members.

      Any of these properties may be changed by unanimous agreement
      of all Members, except for Class which may never change.

Amend Rule 1614 (Organizations' Names) to be titled "Names of Organizations",
and to read:

      Each Organization has a unique Name.  The Name of an Organization
      may only change as specified by its Charter or by the Rules.

Create a new Rule titled "Classes of Organizations" with this text:

      The following Classes of Organizations exist:

        a) Groups.
        b) Contests.

Amend Rule 1612 (Organizations' SLCs) to be titled "Charters of Organizations",
and to read:

      Each Organization has an associated SLC, known as its Charter.  The
      Charter of an Organization may only change as specified by its
      Charter or by the Rules.

      A Member of an Organization is a Player within the jurisdiction of
      its Charter.

      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, no Player shall ever
      involuntarily become a Member of an Organization.

      When an Organization ceases to exist, its Charter ceases to exist.

Amend Rule 1531 (Administrators and Their Duties) to be titled "Administrators
of Organizations", and to read:

      Each Organization shall have an Administrator, who must be a
      Member.  The Administrator of an Organization may only change as
      specified by its Charter or by the Rules.

      The Administrator is Maintainer of the Charter, unless otherwise
      specified by its Charter or by the Rules.

      The Administrator is Executor of the Organization, unless otherwise
      specified by its Charter or by the Rules.

      The Administrator shall inform the Notary of the following changes
      as soon as possible after they occur, and identify the nature of
      the change:

        a) The Name changes.
        b) The Administrator changes.
        c) The Executor changes.
        d) The Maintainer of the Charter changes.
        e) The jurisdiction of the Charter changes.
        f) The Organization voluntarily dissolves.

Amend Rule 1533 (Application to Create an Organization) to read:

      An Application to Create an Organization (ACO) shall be submitted
      to the Notary.

      To be valid, an ACO must specify all properties that an Organization
      is required to have.  Other Rules may place further conditions on the
      validity of ACOs for a specific Class of Organization.

      The effect of submitting a valid ACO is to create the prospective
      Organization, with the Sponsor and signatories as Foundors and
      initial Members.

Amend Rule 1397 (Dissolution of Organizations) to read:

      A Organization shall cease to exist only as specified by its
      Charter or by the Rules.

      An Organization shall cease to exist if it would otherwise lack a
      property that Organizations are required to have.

Repeal Rule 1617 (Changing the Jurisdiction of an Organization's SLC).

Proposal 4182 by Oerjan, AI=2
Bastille Day

Proposal (AI=2)
Bastille Day

The following Rule is created with Power 2, entitled "Bastille Day":

      July 14 of each year shall be known as Bastille Day.  For a
      Revolt called on this day the normal procedure is modified, as
      follows:

         i) Each Rebellious Player shall count twice for the purpose
            of determining success if, during that Bastille Day, e
            publicly hums a few bars of 'La Marseillaise'.

            This includes the determination of the number of players,
            and the Miscreant adjustment, which may become 2 rather
            than 1.

        ii) On success, rather than having all eir Blots expunged,
            each Rebellious Player shall be left with 1 Blot each,
            even if e was previously Immaculate.

      This Rule takes precedence over the normal Revolt Procedure.
