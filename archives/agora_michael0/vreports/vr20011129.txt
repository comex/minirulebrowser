Text of adopted Proposals
-------------------------

Proposal #4234 by Goethe, AI=2
Stems Shall Grow

[    Blah blah blah ]
Amend Rule 1596 (Debts) by appending the following text to the end of
the Rule:

      (f) If two entities are each others' debtor, and all or
          part of their debts to each other are for the same quantity
          (equal portions) of the same fungible Property, then a public
          announcement of this mutual debt by either entity will have the
          effect of satisfying the equal portions of the debts for both
          debtors as in (c) above.



Amend Rule 2004 (Land Auctions) by replacing the following text:

        * The Auction shall be conducted in Indulgences.
with:
        * The Default Auction Currency shall be Indulgences; however,
          the Auctioneer may select a different Bank Currency with
          2 Supporters.



Create a Rule entitled 'Stems Weather', containing the following text:

       As soon as possible after the beginning of each month, the
       Treasuror shall randomly Determine the Weather for the month.
       The Weather can be one of either Foul, Fair, or Plenty, and shall
       be determined using the following probabilities:
                      0.20  Foul.
                      0.30  Fair.
                      0.20  Plenty.
                      0.30  Same as the previous month.

       When the Treasuror posts eir Determination of the Weather for a
       month, the following events shall occur in the listed sequence
       immediately after the Weather is Determined:

            (a) A number of Stems in the Bank's possession, equal
                to the number of Players in the game multiplied
                by the Minimum Income, shall be Destroyed.  If this
                value is greater than the number of Stems in the
                Possession of the Bank, all the Stems in the Possession
                of the Bank shall be Destroyed instead.
            (b) A number of Stems shall be Created in the Bank's
                Possession, equal to the number Destroyed in (a) above
                multiplied by:
                     0.50 if the Weather is Foul;
                     1.00 if the Weather is Fair;
                     1.50 if the Weather is Plenty.

       The Treasuror shall announce the number of Stems Created and
       Destroyed by this Rule in the message in which e announces the
       Weather.


Upon the passage of this Proposal, the weather is determined to be Fair
for the current month.  No Stems are created nor destroyed by this
determination.


Amend Rule 1974 (Restriction on Minting of Bank Currencies by the Bank)
to read:

      The Bank, by the Treasuror, may Mint new units of a Bank
      Currency only as follows:

      (a) At any time, Without Objection, unless the Currency to
          be Minted is Stems.

      (b) In the event that the Voting Entitlement Surplus exceeds the
          Bank's holdings of VEs, a number of VEs not to exceed the
          difference between the Voting Entitlement Surplus and the
          Bank's Holdings of VEs, with Two Supporters.

      The Bank may not otherwise Mint new units of a Bank Currency
      except through the mechanism set forth in this Rule.

Proposal #4235 by Goethe, AI=2
A REVOLUTION IN ENTITLEMENTS

BE IT HEREBY RESOLVED:

AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER THE PASSAGE OF THIS PROPOSAL,
THE ASSESSOR SHALL DETERMINE WHAT THE TAX DEBT OF EACH ENTITY
WOULD BE IF A LEGAL TAX IN VOTING ENTITLEMENTS (VES) WERE LEVIED
AT THE MOMENT OF THE DETERMINATION, SUCH THAT:

   1.  THE TAX WAS ON VES, THE TAX PERCENTAGE WAS 50%.
   2.  THERE WAS AN EXEMPTION OF 0.5 VES FOR PLAYERS, AND
       NO EXEMPTION FOR NON-PLAYERS.
   3.  REBELS WERE TAXABLE, RULES TO THE CONTRARY
       NONWITHSTANDING.
   4.  A RULE EXISTED TO AUTHORIZE THE ASSESSOR TO LEVY
       SAID TAX AT THAT MOMENT.

THE ASSESSOR SHALL POST THIS PROTO-TAX ASSESSMENT, AND
THIS POSTING, IF CORRECT, SHALL HAVE THE EFFECT OF:
   A: DESTROYING A QUANTITY OF VES IN THE POSSESSION OF EACH
      ENTITY EQUAL TO THE (PROTO) TAX DEBT LISTED FOR THEM IN THE
      PROTO-TAX ASSESSMENT;
   B: CREATING A QUANTITY OF VES IN THE POSSESSION OF THE BANK
      EQUAL TO THE QUANTITY DESTROYED AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.
