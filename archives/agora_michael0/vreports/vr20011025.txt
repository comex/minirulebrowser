Proposal #4225 by Syllepsis, AI=1
Perhaps it is Somewhat . . .

[ Full title: Perhaps it is Somewhat More Civilized ]
Fellow Agorans,

The time has come for increased civility within our society. No longer
shall we make Zombies out of the departed and control their ghastly
corpses with Power of Attorney. With the passing of harvel's Gangrene
Repeals, this practice has been not only banned but furthermore
undefined. This change has left quite a few deanimated cadavers lying
about, and some opposition to simply sending the remains of their Arcadian
possessions to the bank and letting the deregistered rest.

Perhaps it should be better that we act in accordance with our newfound
practices, and do what any morally advanced society would do. That is, go
Corpse Looting.

Therefore, let it be decreed that upon the passage of this proposal, the
Notary shall initiate a Looting Auction in full accordance with the Rule
entitled "Looting Auctions" for each of the Dissolute for which e is a
Limited Executor.
