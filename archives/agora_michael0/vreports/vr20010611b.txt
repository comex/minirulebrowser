Proposal 4163 by Kelly, AI=1
Calling Bonds

The following Rule is created, with the title "Calling Bonds":

      At any time, the issuer of a Bond may call that Bond by
      publishing a notice stating that e is calling it.  When the
      issuer of a Bond calls the bond, it is immediately accelerated,
      as described elsewhere.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 4164 by Murphy, AI=1
Fix Dereliction of Duty

Amend Rule 1686 (Official Reports) to read:

      For each Office, the Rules may designate certain information to
      be part of that Office's Weekly Report or Monthly Report. All
      Weekly Reports and Monthly Reports shall also be known as
      Official Reports. All information which is part of an Officer's
      Official Report(s) shall be maintained by that Officer.

      Each Officer with a Weekly Report is required to publish it
      during each Nomic Week; each Officer with a Monthly Report is
      required to publish it during each Nomic Month.  Failure to do
      so is the Class 2 Infraction of Failure to Report.  Failure to
      do so for three consecutive Nomic (Weeks/Months) is instead the
      Class 10 Infraction of Dereliction of Duty; any Officer found
      guilty of this Infraction is automatically retired.  These
      Infractions may be detected and reported by the Assistant Director
      of Personnel and the Speaker.

Repeal Rule 1644 (Dereliction of Duty).

(Rules 1686 and 1644 contain conflicting provisions, apparently because
 Wes's recent Proposal "What Is Public?" put back some old text into one
 or both Rules.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 4165 by Kelly, AI=1
Proper Persistent Indebtedness

Rule 1599 is amended to read:

      The Executor of the creditor of any unsatisfied debt may, at any
      time, demand the debtor to satisfy that debt, provided e has not
      already done so.  E does so by sending a message to the debtor
      setting forth the demand.  The debtor shall have seven days to
      satisfy the debt from the time the demand is sent, except that
      if the debtor's Executor is on Hold at the time the demand is
      sent, the debtor shall instead have seven days from when the
      debtor's Executor comes off Hold to satisfy the debt.  Time
      during which a debt is disputed is not counted for any purpose
      of this Rule.

      A debt not satisfied within the time allowed by this Rule
      becomes delinquent when that time elapses.  It ceases to be
      delinquent when it is satisfied.

      Any Player who is either:
        (a) the Executor of an entity which owes a delinquent debt, or 
	(b) a Limited Executor of an entity which has no Executor and
	    which owes a delinquent debt, where:
	  (1) that Player has the authority to execute a transfer for
	      that entity which would satisfy the delinquent debt, and
	  (2) that entity possesses sufficient Property such that the
	      delinquent debt can be satisfied;
      commits the Class 1 Infraction of Persistent Indebtedness when
      that debt first becomes delinquent, and commits it again every
      seven days thereafter for as long as the debt remains
      delinquent.  This Infraction may be reported by the creditor of
      the delinquent debt.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 4166 by Elysion, AI=1
Fix Rule 1868

[Removes a second ASAP from the process, which reduces the time from calling
to announcement from 14 days 7 and reduces the penalty the CotC incurs from
2 Tardiness infractions to only 1.]

Amend rule 1868/1 (Selecting a Judge) to read:

      Whenever there is an open Call for Judgement to which no Player
      has been assigned as its Judge, the Clerk of the Court shall, as
      soon as possible after being made aware of this condition,
      select a Player to be assigned as its Judge and announce eir
      selection.  This selection shall be made from amongst all
      those Players eligible to serve as the Judge of that CFJ.

      Once selected as the Judge of a CFJ, that Player remains the
      Judge of that CFJ until e is Recused from that CFJ or becomes
      ineligible to Judge that particular CFJ.

      A CFJ is "open" if it has neither been dismissed nor judged, or
      if there is an outstanding judicial motion pertaining to that
      CFJ which has been neither granted nor denied.  A CFJ which is
      not open is closed.

Proposal 4167 by root, AI=1
Choosable Auctions, Vickrey Auctions, and Raffles

[Background on Vickrey Auctions:

     A Vickrey auction differs from the traditional English auction (what
     Agora effectively uses as its default Auction procedure) in two
     respects. First, the bids are sealed and made secretly. Second,
     although the highest-bidding bidder wins, e pays only the
     second-highest bid (or in the general case, the largest nonwinning
     bid). A Vickrey auction discourages bidding wars and encourages
     bidders to bid closer to how they actually value the good.

     Since requiring all players to not discuss bids would be boring,
     the Agoran version of a Vickrey auction would permit, though not
     require, private bidding. If a player wanted to reveal eir bids
     to other players, e could do so anyway, so there's no real reason
     to prohibit bidding in a PF.

     Also, because the Auctioneer and eir Executor have an advantage due
     to their knowledge, they must bid early and publicly. The alternative
     was to prohibit the Auctioneer from bidding, and that seemed
     excessive.

  This proposal also:
     * Allows Auctioneers to choose an auction format
     * Provides the Raffle Auction format ]


Amend rule 1887/12 (Default Procedure for Auctions) by replacing the text
reading:

       When an Auction is required and the procedure is not defined
       elsewhere, the following standard Auction procedure shall be
       used. Details specified herein are defaults which may be
       modified by other Rules for specific situations.

with:

       When an Auction is required and the procedure is not defined
       elsewhere, the Auctioneer shall select a rules-defined Auction
       Procedure and publicly announce eir selection. If e does not
       specify which procedure is used, the Default Auction Procedure
       shall be used.

       The details specified herein are for the Default Auction
       Procedure.

and by replacing the text reading:

       Unless specified otherwise, the Auctioneer shall transfer an
       Auctioned item to the winning Bidder as soon as possible
       after the bill for that item is paid.

with:

       Unless specified otherwise, the Auctioneer shall pay out an
       Auctioned item to the winning Bidder as soon as possible
       after the bill for that item is paid.


Amend rule 1888/0 (Private Auctions) to read:

       The Auction Procedure for a Private Auction is the same as
       the Default Auction Procedure except that Bids may only made
       by sending them privately to the Auctioneer.


Create a rule entitled "Vickrey Auctions" reading as follows:

       The Auction Procedure for a Vickrey Auction is the same as
       the Default Auction Procedure with the following modifications:

       (a) Bidders: Every Player not on Hold may Bid in an Auction. On
           Hold status is measured at the time a Player sends eir Bid. Any
           Player with the same Executor as the Auctioneer may bid only in
           the first 72 hours of the Auction.

       (b) Making Bids: If the Bidder has the same Executor as the
           Auctioneer, then the Bids must be made in a message to
           a Public Forum. Otherwise, the Bidder may either Bid in a
           Public Forum or privately to the Auctioneer.

       (c) End of Auction: The Auction shall end one week after it
           begins.

       (d) The Final Auction Price is:
           (1) The amount of the largest nonwinning uncancelled valid
               Bid, if there were N or more valid uncancelled Bids in
               the Auction;
           (2) The Starting Bid, if there were fewer than N valid
               uncancelled Bids.
           For the purpose of this Rule, N is equal to the number of
           items being Auctioned.

       The Auctioneer and eir Executor must treat all bids made in a
       Vickrey Auction as secret while the Auction is in progress. Other
       players, however, are free to reveal as much about their bidding as
       they wish.


Create a rule titled "Raffles" reading as follows:

       There is a type of Auction named a Raffle. The Auction Procedure
       for a Raffle is as follows:

       (a) Riff-Raff: The Riff-Raff is responsible for selling Raffle
           tickets and announcing the result of the Raffle. Unless
           otherwise specified, the Speaker shall be the Riff-Raff.

       (b) Entrants: Every Player not on Hold may enter the Raffle. On
           Hold status is measured at the time a Player enters the
           Raffle.

       (c) Raffle Currency: Each Raffle is conducted in one
           particular currency. The Rule requiring a particular
           Raffle must specify the currency to be used, or the
           Raffle cannot take place.

       (d) Number of Items: Each Raffle is conducted for 1 or more
           identical items. Throughout this Rule, N indicates the
           number of items up for bid in the Raffle.

       (e) Start of Auction: The Raffle begins at the time the first
           correct and legal announcement that a Raffle is begun, as
           defined in other Rules, is published, together with the
           identity of the Riff-Raff, the Raffle Currency, the number
           of items, and the Ticket Price.

       (f) Ticket Price: All tickets shall have the same Ticket Price.
           If not otherwise specified, the Ticket Price shall be equal
           to the MUQ of the Raffle Currency.

       (g) Buying Tickets: An Entrant buys a ticket by paying a Fee of
           the Ticket Price in the Raffle Currency to the Bank, provided
           that the purchase is not made before the start of the Auction,
           or after its end. Each Entrant may buy as many tickets as e
           desires during the Auction.

       (h) End of Raffle: If, one week after the Raffle started,
           no Raffle tickets have been bought, the Raffle ends, and
           has no winner. Otherwise the Raffle ends when 72 hours
           have passed without a valid ticket purchase having been
           made. The Raffle shall end 14 days after the Raffle has
           started, if it has not ended earlier.

       (i) Winning Tickets: When the Raffle ends, the Riff-Raff shall
           randomly determine N valid Raffle tickets as having won
           the Raffle. Each Raffle ticket has one chance to win, and
           multiple Raffle tickets bought by the same Entrant may win.
           If there were less than N valid Raffle tickets, then all
           valid Raffle tickets shall be considered to have won the
           Raffle.

       (j) Final Auction Price: The Final Auction Price for a Raffle
           is equal to the Ticket Price.

       (k) Riff-Raff's Gratuity: Within a week after the end of the
           Raffle, the Riff-Raff may pay out to emself the Ticket Price
           in the Raffle Currency if:
           (1) The Raffle had at least three separate winning Entrants,
               not including the Riff-Raff; and
           (2) The Riff-Raff has not already done so for that Raffle.

       (l) Announcing Winners: As soon as possible after the end of the
           Raffle, the Riff-Raff shall announce the winning tickets and
           transfer to each winning Entrant a separate Auctioned item for
           each of eir winning tickets.
