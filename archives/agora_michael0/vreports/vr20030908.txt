Text of Adopted Proposals

Proposal 4526 by Steve, AI=2, Democratic
Voting Potential fix

Amend Rule 2052 (Voting Potential) by replacing the text in it which
currently reads:

       (b) At any time, a Player may, by announcement, set their Voting
           Potential to any positive integer N.  The Fee associated
           with this action is the Oligarchy Charge Requirement
           multiplied by N.

with text which reads:

       (b) At any time, a Player may, by announcement, increase their
           Voting Potential by a positive integral amount, N. The Fee
           associated with this action is the Oligarchy Charge
           Requirement multiplied by N.

[Comment: the present wording has some odd effects, e.g.: that it costs
the same amount -- 12 kudos -- to change one's Voting Potential from +1
to +2 as it does to change it from 0 to +2.]
