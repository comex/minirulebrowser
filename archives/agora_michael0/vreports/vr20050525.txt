       The Registrar's Weekly Report shall include all of the following
       information:

with text that reads:

       The Registrar's Bi-Weekly Report shall include all of the
       following information:

Amend Rule 1686 (Official Reports) to read:

       The Rules may designate certain information to be part of an
       Office's Weekly Report, Bi-Weekly Report or Monthly Report.  An
       Office's Weekly Reports, Bi-Weekly Reports and Monthly Reports
       constitute the Office's Official Report.  All information that
       is part of an Office's Official Report shall be maintained by
       the corresponding officer.

       Each officer with a Weekly Report must publish it weekly unless
       the content of the report would substantially be the same as in
       the previously published report. In this case, a report must
       only be published within one week of the next substantial change
       to the report's content, but must at least be published once per
       month.  Each officer with a Bi-Weekly Report must publish it
       once every two weeks and each officer with a Monthly Report must
       publish it monthly.  Failure to do so is the Class 2 Infraction
       of Failure to Report.  If an officer fails to do so for at least
       three consecutive reporting periods, e may be cited for either
       Failure to Report or the Class 10 Infraction of Dereliction of
       Duty but not both.  Any officer cited for Dereliction of Duty is
       immediately removed from that office. The Assistant Director of
       Personnel and the Speaker may report these Infractions.
