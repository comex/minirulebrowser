Proposal 4528 by Goethe, AI=2, Democratic, Disinterested
Fi Fo Fum Fees


Proposal:  Fi Fo Fum Fees

Amend Rule 1941 to read:

       If the Rules associate a non-negative cost, price, charge, or
       fee with an action, that action is a fee-based action.  If the
       specified cost is not an integer, the actual fee is the next
       highest integer.

       To perform a fee-based action, a Player (the Actor) who is
       otherwise permitted to perform the action must announce that e
       is performing the action and announce that there is a fee for
       that action.  Upon said announcement, the action is performed,
       the Actor's kudos are decreased by the fee, and Agora's kudos
       are increased by the fee.

       Any Player (hereafter the challenger) may announce that the
       Actor possessed insufficient Honor (kudos) to perform the
       action, provided e issues eir challenge within 7 days of the
       attempted action.

       As soon as possible after such a challenge, the Herald shall
       confirm or deny whether the Actor possessed kudos equal to or
       greater than the fee at the time e attempted the action.
       If the Actor in fact possessed insufficient honor, or the honor
       of the Actor cannot be determined by reasonable effort, the action
       shall be deemed to have not occurred and the kudos of the Actor
       (and Agora) shall be deemed to have not been changed by the fee.

       If a Player issues a challenge as above, but more than 7 days
       have passed since the attempted action, then the action shall be
       permitted to stand.  As soon as possible after a late challenge
       is issued, the Herald shall confirm or deny its correctness.
       But in this case the Fee shall be recorded even if the Actor is
       left with negative kudos.
