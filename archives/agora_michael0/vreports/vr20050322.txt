Kudos for Cards


Create a power 1 Rule called "Cash Cards" with the following text

"* Caption: Greedy Bastard
Elements: Budgeted
Exploit:  Gain one Kudo, but also gain the Albatross of Greed.

* Caption: Charity Brings Happiness
Elements: Budgeted
Exploit: For a fee of one Kudo you may indicate any other player to
gain one Kudo, as long as they have fewer Kudos than you do and is not
yourself.  Upon doing this you gain the boon of Charity.

* Caption: Thieves in the Night
Element: Grafty, Delayed[5]
Exploit: Provided that fewer than half of all gamblers, besides the
deck, have a 'Thieves in the Night' card in their hand, and the player
you indicate does not have a 'Thieves in the Night' card in their
hand, That player losses one Kudo and you gain one Kudo.  For each of
the aforementioned  stipulations that is false upon the playing of
this card, you gain the Albatross of Thief."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Proposal 4649 by Quazie, AI=2, Democratic
Magical Mute Exemption Tour


Create a rule entitled "Mute Exemption":

       A Legislator who is Mute may, with two support, submit a body of
       text with Mute Exemption.  This text becomes a Proposal if
       it meets all rule requirements for a Proposal other than the
       Proposer not being Mute.

       As soon as possible after a Proposal with Mute Exemption passes,
       the Assessor shall expunge a number of Blots from the Proposer
       equal to the Adoption Index of the Proposal.  The Proposer shall
       receive no Boons that may have awarded by other rules for the
       passing of the Proposal.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Proposal 4650 by Murphy, AI=1, Ordinary
Late Announcement of Elections for Offices


Amend Rule 1558 (Defaults for Elections for Offices) by appending
this text:

     * If the Vote Collector fails to meet an ASAP requirement to
       publish a list of Candidates, or the identity of the
       winning Candidate, then the Election/Referendum does not
       fail, but becomes Stale.  If a new Election for the same
       Office is initiated, then the stale Election/Referendum fails.

Amend Rule 790 (Filling Vacant Offices) by replacing this text:

     As soon as possible after an Office ceases to have an
     Electee (or is created without installing an Electee),
     the designated conductor of Office Elections shall
     initiate an Election for that Office, as described by
     other Rules.

with this text:

     As soon as possible after

       a) an Office ceases to have an Electee;
       b) an Office is created without installing an Electee; or
       c) an Election for an Office without an Electee becomes Stale;

     the designated conductor of Office Elections shall
     initiate an Election for that Office, as described by
     other Rules.  This requirement is cancelled if the Office
     comes to have an Electee.
