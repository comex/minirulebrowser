Proposal 4162 by Elysion, AI=1
Fix Rule 1712

[This proposal:
      * Eliminates the ambiguous situation when IICL-AICL is not an integer
      * Cleans up some language
 History:
      * v1.1:
        + Restored the accidentally deleted "good faith" clause ]

Amend rule 1712/9 (Distribution of Indulgences) by replacing the text
reading:

      As soon as possible after the start of each month, the Herald
      shall Auction a number of Indulgences equal to the difference
      between the AICL and the IICL. If the AICL is equal to or
      greater than the IICL, no auction shall be held. To calculate
      the difference, the Herald shall determine the number of Blots
      and the number of Indulgences owned as published in the most
      recent Herald's Report; other values in the formula shall be
      determined as of the time of the start of the auction.
      However, if the Herald makes an error in determining the
      number of Indulgences to be Auctioned, in good faith, that
      number shall be allowed to stand.

      The items to be auctioned are individual Indulgences, and thus
      the number of items is equal to the number of Indulgences to be
      Auctioned. The Auctioneer shall be the Herald, and the Auction
      shall be conducted in Stems. Only Acolytes may bid.

with:

      As soon as possible after the start of each month, the Herald
      shall calculate the Indulgence Differential, which is equal to
      the IICL minus the AICL, rounded down to the nearest integer.
      To calculate the Indulgence Differential, the Herald shall
      determine the number of Blots and the number of Indulgences
      owned as published in the most recent Herald's Report;
      other values in the formula shall be determined as of
      the time of the calculation. If the Herald makes an error
      in determining the number of Indulgences to be Auctioned,
      in good faith, that number shall be allowed to stand.

      If the Indulgence Differential is greater than zero, then the
      Herald shall, as soon as possible after the start of that month,
      auction a number of Indulgences equal to the Indulgence
      Differential; if the Indulgence Differential is not greater than
      zero, the Herald shall not auction any Indulgences that month.

      In an Indulgence Auction held in accordance with this rule, the
      items to be auctioned are individual Indulgences, and thus
      the number of items is equal to the number of Indulgences to be
      Auctioned. In addition, the Auctioneer shall be the Herald,
      and the Auction shall be conducted in Stems with only Acolytes
      being allowed to bid.
