Text of Adopted Proposals
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 4828 by Maud, AI=1, Democratic
Welcome All Coauthors


Amend rule 1430 (Mandatory Rule Annotations) to read:

      Whenever a rule is changed in any way, the Rulekeeper shall
      record a historical annotation to the rule indicating:

      (a) the type of change;
      (b) if the rule was changed due to a proposal, a reference to
          that proposal, its proposer, and any coauthors explicitly
          named in that proposal;
      (c) if the rule was changed by some other mechanism, the
          mechanism which specified the change; and
      (d) the date on which the change took effect.

      Other rules may require additional information to appear in an
      annotation for certain types of Rule Change.

      Annotations to a rule are not part of the rule, and annotating a
      rule is not a rule change.  The Rulekeepor shall indicate all
      annotations in such a way that they are readily distinguished
      from the text of the rule.

      When a rule is repealed, all annotations attached to it are
      discarded, and need not appear in the published Ruleset.

Proposal 4829 by Maud, AI=2, Democratic
The Cobalt Repairs


Change the title of rule 1932 (Shareholders and the Corporation) to
"Shares and Shareholders", and amend it to read:

      A Stock Card is a card with the Element "Shares [X]".

      The Share Holdings of an entity is the number of Shares
      possessed by that entity.  The Number of Shares is the sum of
      the Share Holdings of all entities.

      A Shareholder is an entity with positive Share Holdings.  A
      Plebeian is a player who is not a Shareholder.  The Corporation
      is the collection of all Shareholders.

Repeal rule 1963 (Eligible Shareholders).

Amend rule 1483 (Definition of Proposals) to read:

      A proposal is a document outlining changes to be made to Agora,
      including enacting, repealing, or amending rules, or making
      other explicit changes to the gamestate.

      A legislator submits a proposal by publishing it with a clear
      indication that it is intended to become a proposal.  As soon as
      possible afterward, the Promotor shall add this proposal to the
      Proposal Pool.

      Before the Promotor distributes a proposal, its proposer may
      modify its adoption index by announcement.  The default adoption
      index of a proposal is one.

      All players are legislators.

Repeal rule 1953 (Sane Proposals).

Amend rule 1952 (Making Proposals Distributable) to read:

      The Promotor shall have a budget containing the per-player
      proposal limit, which shall be a positive integer defaulting to
      four.

      Depth is a stuck proposal switch with values undistributable and
      distributable.

      Before the Promotor distributes a proposal, its proposer may
      flip its depth by announcement as long as the number of eir
      distributable proposals which have been submitted but have not
      been distributed or retracted is less than the per-player
      proposal limit.

Repeal rule 2021 (Chamber Procedure).
