PROPOSAL TEXT
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal:  Red Tape Repeals 2.0

[Minor Wording changes from Maud from v1.0 to 2.0]
[Cut bureaucracy to 5: Speaker, Herald, Promotor, Rulekeepor, CotC.
(assumes cards are killed elsewhere).  Turns elections into actions of
Agoran Consent.  Simplifies some wording in Proposals section,
eliminates chambers, makes Speaker the vote collector in place of the
Assessor]

The Rulekeepor is hereby requested to place Rules in categories as
indicated by this Proposal, in the order indicated in this Proposal,
which may involve the creation of new categories, moving of rules, or
the deletion of categories.  Some rules are included for reference and
indication of new placement without being actually amended.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 2124 (Agoran Consent) to read:

       An entity that may perform an action with Agoran Consent can do
       so by announcement if all of the following are true:

       (a) e has published eir intent to perform the action,
           unambiguously describing the action to be performed, at
           least four days and no more than fourteen days before
           attempting to perform the action;

       (b) at least one other player has announced (and not withdrawn)
           support for the intended action since intent was published;
           and

       (c) more players have announced (and not withdrawn) support than
           have announced (and not withdrawn) objections to the action
           since the intent was published.

======================================================================
Offices
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 103/1 (Power=3)
The Speaker May Not Deregister

       At any time, there is exactly one Player who is the Speaker. The
       Speaker may not deregister or be deregistered for any reason,
       any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 402 (Church and State) to read:

       A cardinal is an active, ready player who is not the current
       Speaker.

       For seven days after a cardinal wins the game with no other
       players simultaneously winning, then any player may announce
       that the winning cardinal becomes a pope.  Upon this
       announcement, that player becomes a pope, so please treat em
       right good forever.  Also upon this announcement, the current
       Speaker ceases to be Speaker, and the new pope is installed as
       the new Speaker.

       If the legality of an installation is not challenged within
       seven days of it being attempted, then it shall be allowed to
       stand, even if is subsequently found to be illegal.

       Rules to the contrary nonwithstanding, if a Player becomes
       Speaker via this method, e may not be removed from the
       Speakership for 90 days without eir own consent.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 1006 (Offices) to read:

       The Rules may designate positions to be offices.  No office may
       be held by more than one player.  Each office that would
       otherwise not be held by any player shall be held by the
       Speaker, unless it is not possible for the Speaker to hold that
       office.

       The holder of an office may be referred to by the name of the
       office.  The Herald shall list the holder of each office, and
       the date upon which each holder last came to hold that office.

       Any Player may make an active Player the holder of an office,
       thus removing any previous holder from the office, with Agoran
       Consent, provided:
       (a) that office has not changed hands with this method in the
           previous 30 days, and
       (b) the potential officer consents to hold the office after the
           announcement of intent is made.

       If no attempt to acheive Agoran Consent for changing the holder
       of particular office is announced in a given quarter, then the
       Speaker shall make at least one such attempt to change the
       officeholder in the following quarter, and make the change if
       consent is acheived.

       If the duty of an office is to maintain certain information,
       than the officer shall publish that information once a month, or
       as soon as possible after a substantial change occurs in the
       information or the officer receives a request for the
       information.  A weekly report shall be sufficient to satisfy
       these last two requirements.

       If an Officer or the Speaker fails to satisfy a Timing Order to
       perform a certain offical duty, than the player who executed the
       order may perform the duty as if e were the officer.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

AMEND Rule 1551 (Ratification) to read:

       An officer is permitted to ratify, without objection, an
       official report e produced and was required to maintain by
       virtue of holding that office.  The Speaker is permitted to
       ratify, without objection, any official report.

       When a document is ratified, the gamestate is modified so that
       the ratified document was completely true and accurate at the
       time it was published.  Nevertheless, the ratification of a
       document does not invalidate, reverse, alter, or cancel any
       messages or actions, even if they were unrecorded or overlooked,
       or change the legality of any attempted action.

       A document's maintainer shall annotate all publications of that
       document with the date of its most recent ratification.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 1377 (The Herald) to read:

       The Herald is an office; its holder is responsible for keeping
       track of the History of Agora and its players.

       The Herald's Weekly Report shall include the following:

          (i) A list of each Patent Title and Degree that at least one
              person Bears, with a list of which persons Bear it.

         (ii) a list of all registered players, with their nicknames,
              if any, and listed email addresses;

        (iii) the most recent date on which each registered player
              registered;

         (iv) the current Officers and their dates of service.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1051/17 (Power=1)
The Rulekeepor

       The Rulekeepor is an office; its holder is responsible for
       maintaining the text of the rules of Agora.

       The Rulekeepor's Weekly Report shall include the Short Logical
       Ruleset.  The Rulekeepor's Monthly Report shall include the Full
       Logical Ruleset.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 1681 (The Logical Rulesets) to read:

       There is a format of the ruleset known as the Short Logical
       Ruleset (SLR).  In this format, each rule is assigned to a
       category, and the rules are grouped according to their category.

       Rules are assigned to, ordered within, or moved between
       categories, and categories are added, changed, or empty
       categories removed, as the Rulekeepor sees fit.

       The listing of each rule in the SLR must include the rule's
       number, revision number, power, title, and text, and must also
       include any annotations to the rule required by order.

       The Rulekeepor is strongly encouraged not to include any
       additional information in the SLR, except that which increases
       the readability of the SLR.

       There is a format of the ruleset known as the Full Logical
       Ruleset (FLR).  In this format, rules are assigned to the same
       category and presented in the same order as in the SLR.  The FLR
       must contain all the information required to be in the SLR, and
       any historical annotations which the Rulekeepor is required to
       record.

       The Rulekeepor is also free to include any other information
       which e feels may be helpful in the use of the ruleset in the
       FLR.

       Whenever a rule is changed in any way, the Rulekeeper shall
       record a historical annotation to the rule indicating the type
       of change, the date on which the change took effect, the
       mechanism which specified the change, and if the rule was
       changed due to a proposal, a reference to that proposal, its
       proposer, and any coauthors explicitly named in that proposal.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 889/13 (Power=1)
The Clerk of the Courts

       The Clerk of the Courts (CotC) is an office; its holder is
       responsible for receiving and distributing Calls for Judgement
       (CFJs) and Appeals.

       The CotC's Bi-Weekly Report shall include the following:
          (i) Each Player's Orientation.

       The CotC's Monthly Report shall include the Stare Decisis, which
       is a list of past CFJs.  The following information shall be
       included for each CFJ:

         (i) its statement;
        (ii) the date on which it was called;
       (iii) its outcome (if any) on Judgement; and
        (iv) its outcome (if any) on Appeal.

       Whenever a CFJ is made, the CotC shall add it to the list.  E
       may, at eir discretion, add earlier CFJs.  E may Without
       Objection remove any CFJ e deems no longer relevant from the
       list.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 1607 (The Promotor) to read:

       The Promotor is an office; its holder is responsible for
       receiving and distributing proposals.

       The Promotor is permitted to distribute a proposal in the
       Proposal Pool at any time.  During each week, the Promotor must
       distribute each proposal in the proposal pool which was in the
       Proposal Pool at the beginning of the week.

       The Promotor legally distributes a proposal by publishing it
       accompanied by an explicit indication that it is being
       distributed.  When a proposal is distributed, it is removed from
       the Proposal Pool.  The distribution of a proposal initiates the
       Agoran decision of whether to adopt the proposal, as described
       elsewhere.

       The Promotor shall include with the distribution of each
       proposal the identity of its proposer, the proposal's coauthors,
       if any, its chamber, and its adoption index.  However, the
       failure of the Promotor to include any of these with a proposal
       does not deprive the distribution of the proposal of any legal
       effect.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 1450 (Judicial Separation) by renaming it 'Separation of
Powers', increasing its power to 2, and amending it to read:

       The Speaker, Clerk of the Courts, and Promotor are mutually
       exclusive offices.  A Player holding one of these offices may
       not come to simultaneously hold another of them, unless there
       are no other Players in the game eligible.  This Rule takes
       precedence over any other Rule that governs offices.

======================================================================
Agoran Decisions
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 693 (Power=3) Agoran Decisions to read:

       When the rules calls for an Agoran decision to be made, the
       decisionmaking process takes place in the following three
       stages, each described elsewhere:

           (a) Initiation of the decision.
           (b) Voting of the people.
           (c) Resolution of the decision.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 107 (Initiating Agoran Decisions) to read:

       An Agoran decision is initiated when a person authorized to
       initiate it publishes a valid notice which sets forth the intent
       to initiate the decision.  To be valid, this notice must contain
       the following information:

       (a) The matter to be decided (for example, "the adoption of
           proposal 4781").

       (b) A description of the class of eligible voters sufficient to
           enable public agreement on which persons are eligible.  In
           particular, an explicit list of the eligible voters is
           always sufficient for this purpose.

       (c) The identity of the vote collector.

       (d) Any additional information required by the rules for this
           announcement.

       The publication of such a valid notice initiates the voting
       period for the decision.  By default, the voting period lasts
       for seven days.  This rule takes precedence over any rule which
       would require a voting period for some decision to be shorter
       than seven days.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 683/12 (Power=3)
Voting on Agoran Decisions

       An eligible voter on a particular Agoran decision submits a
       ballot to the vote collector by publishing a valid notice
       indicating which one of the available options e selects.  To be
       valid, the ballot must satisfy the following conditions:

       (a) The ballot is submitted by an eligible voter during the
           voting period for the decision.

       (b) The ballot clearly identifies the matter to be decided.

       (c) The ballot clearly identifies the option selected by the
           voter.

       (d) The voter has not publicly retracted the ballot during the
           voting period.

       The strength of an option is the number of valid ballots
       selecting that option.

       Other rules may place further constraints on the validity of
       ballots.  This rule takes precedence over any rule that would
       loosen the constraints specified by this rule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2117/0 (Power=3)
Replacing the Vote Collector

       If the rules indicate that an office is to be responsible for
       collecting votes on a particular Agoran decision, then the
       holder of that office is the default vote collector for that
       decision.

       The vote collector for a particular Agoran decision is tardy if
       and only if the voting collector has continuously held that role
       for at least seven days following the end of the voting period
       and the decision has not yet been resolved.  If a vote collector
       is tardy, then the first player to announce that e takes up the
       role of vote collector becomes the vote collector for that
       decision.

       This rule takes precedence over any rule that would allow the
       vote collector for an Agoran decision to be changed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 1950 (Voting Limits) to read:

       The voting limit of an eligible voter on a democratic proposal
       is always one and cannot be changed.

       The voting limit of an eligible voter on an ordinary proposal is
       one, if not explicitly modified by other rules.

       After the voting period for an Agoran decision has ended, the
       vote collector shall permit the first valid ballots submitted by
       an eligible voter to remain valid, up to a number equal to that
       person's voting limit on that decision as determined when the
       voting period for that decision began, and shall invalidate all
       subsequent ballots submitted by that voter on that decision.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 208/3 (Power=3)
Resolving Agoran decisions

       The vote collector for a particular Agoran decision is
       authorized to resolve that decision, and does so by publishing a
       valid notice which states that the matter has been resolved,
       indicating the option selected by Agora.  To be valid, this
       notice must satisfy the following conditions:

       (a) It is published after the voting period has ended.

       (b) It clearly identifies the matter to be resolved.

       (c) It clearly identifies the options available.

       (d) It specifies which option was selected by Agora, as
           described elsewhere, and provides a tally of the voters'
           valid ballots on the various options.

       Each Agoran decision shall have at most one vote collector at a
       time.  The identity of the vote collector is set by the message
       initiating the decision, and can only be changed as specified by
       other rules with power at least as great as that of this rule.

       This rule takes precedence over any rule that would provide
       another mechanism by which an Agoran decision may be resolved.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 955 (Determining the Will of Agora) to read:

       To determine which option on a particular Agoran decision was
       selected by Agora, the vote collector shall perform the
       following steps in order after the voting period has ended.

       (a) E shall invalidate any ballots which the rules require em to
           invalidate, and no others.

       (b) E shall count the number of distinct voters who submitted
           ballots which remain valid.  If this number is less than the
           quorum and there is more than one available option, then the
           option selected by Agora is FAILED QUORUM.  Otherwise, the
           decision achieved quorum.

       (c) If the decision is whether to adopt a proposal, e shall
           determine the voting index as follows:

           (1) if the strength of FOR is positive and the strength of
               AGAINST is zero, then the voting index is Unanimity; but

           (2) if the strength of FOR is zero, then the voting index is
               zero; otherwise,

           (3) the voting index is the ratio of the strength of FOR to
               the strength of AGAINST.

           If the voting index exceeds one and meets or exceeds the
           adoption index of the decision, and if further quorum was
           achieved, then the option selected by Agora is ADOPTED.
           Otherwise, the option selected by Agora is REJECTED.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 879/22 (Power=2)
Quorum

       The quorum for an Agoran decision is one third the number of
       eligible voters, rounded up, with a minimum of five (unless
       there are fewer than five eligible voters, in which case the
       quorum level is the number of eligible voters).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2034/2 (Power=3)
Vote Protection and Cutoff for Challenges

       Any proposal that, as all or part of its effect, would change
       the validity of one or more of a voter's ballots on an Agoran
       decision whose voting period has begun but which has not yet
       been resolved shall be wholly without effect, any rule to the
       contrary notwithstanding.

       Once an Agoran decision has been resolved, no ballots on that
       decision may be validly submitted or retracted, and the outcome
       of the decision may not be changed in any way, any rule to the
       contrary notwithstanding.  Nothing in this rule shall be
       construed as preventing the correction of errors in reporting
       the resolution of an Agoran decision.

       If the success of the resolution of an Agoran decision is not
       challenged within one week from the time the vote collector
       announces it, then the announced result is the true result of
       that decision, even if it would otherwise be in error.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Repeal Rule 1434 (Default Procedure for Referendum Voting)

======================================================================
Proposals
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 106 (Adopting Proposals) to read:

       A proposal is a document outlining changes to be made to Agora,
       including enacting, repealing, or amending rules, or making
       other explicit changes to the gamestate.

       A player submits a proposal by publishing it with a clear
       indication that it is intended to become a proposal, which
       places the proposal in the Proposal Pool.  The proposer of a
       proposal may remove it from the Pool by announcement.

       Determining whether to adopt a proposal is an Agoran decision.
       For this decision, the available options are FOR, AGAINST, and
       PRESENT, and by default, the eligible voters are the active
       players, the adoption index is the adoption index of the
       proposal, and the vote collector is the Speaker.

       The default adoption index of a proposal is one.  Before the
       Promotor distributes a proposal, its proposer may modify its
       adoption index by announcement.  A Proposal with an Adoption
       Index of 1 is Ordinary.  All other Proposals are Democratic.

       If the option selected by Agora on this decision is ADOPTED,
       then the proposal is adopted, and unless other rules prevent it
       from taking effect, its power is set to the minimum of four and
       its adoption index, and then it takes effect.  It does not
       otherwise take effect.  This rule takes precedence over any rule
       which would permit a proposal to take effect.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1698/0 (Power=3)
The Proposal System Is Protected

       It must always be possible to adopt Proposals within a 4 week
       period. Any change to the game state which would result in
       this condition becoming false is cancelled and does not take
       place, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

       No enactment, repeal, or amendment of the text or substantive
       properties of a Rule may have retroactive application.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 105 (What Is a Rule Change?) to be called "Rule Changes"
and amend it to read as follows:

       A proposal generally can, as part of its effect:

       (a) Enact a rule.  When a rule is enacted, the Rulekeepor shall
       assign it a number, which must be greater than any number
       previously assigned.  If the enacting proposal does not specify
       the power, the rule shall have power equal to one.  If the
       proposal specifies the power, then the rule shall have power
       equal to the minimum of four, the power of the proposal, and the
       power specified by the proposal.  If the title is not specified,
       the Rulekeepor may select any title e sees fit.

       (b) Modify the power, title, or text of a rule.  A Proposal can
       modify the power, title, or text of a rule with power no greater
       than its own.  However, a proposal cannot cause a rule to have
       power greater than its own.  Any ambiguity in a modification
       specified by a proposal causes that modification to be void and
       without effect.  A variation in whitespace or capitalization in
       the quotation of an existing rule does not constitute ambiguity
       for the purposes of this rule, but any other variation does.

       (c) Repeal a rule.  When a proposal repeals a rule, it ceases to
       be a rule, and the Rulekeepor need no longer maintain a record

Rule 1891/0 (Power=1)
Legislative Orders

       (a) A Proposal may contain one or more Orders.

       (b) The effect of adopting a Proposal which contains Orders is
           to execute those Orders.  Such Orders are known as
           Legislative Orders, are deemed to have been executed by that
           Proposal, and are deemed to have been executed as of the
           date of the proclamation of the Proposal's adoption.

       (c) Legislative Orders may not be stayed, vacated, or amended
           except:
         (1) by a subsequent Legislative Order;
         (2) by a Judicial Order issued only after a judicial finding
             that the Proposal containing the Legislative Order was not
             adopted, was barred from taking effect, or was invalid; or
         (3) by the Clerk of the Courts, but only for the purpose of
             staying such an Order during the pendency of a dispute
             which might reasonably lead to a judicial finding of the
             sort mentioned in subdivision (c)(2) of this Rule.

The Speaker's Veto

       The Speaker may veto an Ordinary Proposal in its voting period

       Assessor shall place a copy of that proposal to the Proposal
       Pool.  When e does so, that copy shall become distributable and
       democratic, and its adoption index shall be increased by one.

       The Speaker may Rubberstamp an Ordinary Proposal in its voting
       period by announcement.  Quorum for a rubberstamped ordinary
       proposal is three, other rules governing quorum nonwithstanding.
