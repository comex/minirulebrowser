Text of Adopted Proposals
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 4540 by Murphy, AI=1, Democratic
Boon of Zeitgeist


Create a new Rule titled "Boon of Zeitgeist" with this text:

         If an Interested Democratic Proposal passes, and no Votes were
         cast AGAINST it, then the Assessor shall award the Proposor the
         Boon of Zeitgeist.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Proposal 4542 by Murphy, AI=1, Democratic
Pragmatize Scoring


Change the title of Rule 2055 to "The Scorekeepor's Budget", and
amend it to read:

         The Scorekeepor's Budget shall contain the following:

           a) The Team Points Goal, a positive integer.
           b) The Player Points Limit, a positive integer.
           c) Points Per Player, a positive integer.
           d) One or more scoring events, each with the following
              information:
                  i) Whether it is an award or a penalty.
                 ii) The amount of the award/penalty, a positive integer.
                iii) The conditions required for the event to occur.
                 iv) A description of which player/team receives the
                     award/penalty.

         Each scoring event in the Scorekeepor's Budget may cause the
         specified player/team to be awarded/penalized the specified
         number of points, as defined by other rules.

Amend Rule 1990 (Points Contest) by changing "PPP (Points Per Player)"
to "Points Per Player", then changing each instance of "PPP" to "Points
Per Player", then changing each instance of "PLIMIT" to "Player Points
Limit".

Amend Rule 1929 (Points) by appending this text:

         If the event did not actually occur, and the notification is
         challenged within 7 days for this reason, then the notification
         is invalid and points do not change.

         If the event did not actually occur, and the notification is
         not challenged within 7 days for this reason, then the notification
         is valid and points change.  If the notification is challenged
         later, then the player may be penalized/awarded a number of points
         equal to the original award/penalty.

Amend Rule 2053 (Team Points, Team Scores) by appending this text:

         If the event did not actually occur, and the notification is
         challenged within 7 days for this reason, then the notification
         is invalid and points do not change.

         If the event did not actually occur, and the notification is
         not challenged within 7 days for this reason, then the notification
         is valid and points change.  If the notification is challenged
         later, then the team may be penalized/awarded a number of points
         equal to the original award/penalty.
