Text of Adopted Proposals

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 4339 by Sir Toby, AI=1
Fix Robespierre - Take 2

Amend rule 1923 by replacing the following text:

      (a)  Robespierre, which shall automatically be awarded to the
           Player who called for a Revolt, it the Revolt succeeds.

with this text:

      (a)  Robespierre, which shall automatically be awarded to the
           Player who called for a Revolt, if the Revolt succeeds.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 4340 by root, AI=2
Fix Property Protection

Upmutate the Rule titled "Property Protection" to have Power = 2.

Proposal #02-104 by Steve, AI=3
Really, No Double Jeopardy

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 4341 by Steve, AI=3
Really, No Double Jeopardy

This Proposal has an AI of 3.

[The current discussion has convinced me that R1816 is inadequate. Its
provisions are too narrow, covering only Crimes, and in any case
ineffective because they conflist with R1565.]

Amend Rule 1816 (No Double Jeopardy) to read:

  (a) No Player may be penalized more than once for any single act, or
      failure to act, that is in violation of one or more Rules.

  (b) Where a CFJ exists whose Statement alleges that a Player has
      through action or inaction violated a Rule, and that CFJ has not
      been dismissed, any further CFJ alleging that the same Player
      has through the same action or inaction violated the same Rule,
      lacks standing and shall be dismissed.

Increase the Power of Rule 1816 to 3.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 4342 by root, AI=1
Pragmatic Judge Selection

Amend Rule 1871 (Turns For All) by changing it to read:
 
       Whenever a Player is selected as Trial Judge of a CFJ, e begins
       to Turn Around And Around.  Players who are Turning Around And
       Around are ineligible to be Trial Judge of any future CFJs.

       Whenever there are no Players eligible to be Trial Judge of a
       CFJ, all Players who are Turning Around And Around cease Turning
       Around And Around.

 
Create a new Rule, titled "Errors in Judge Selection", which reads:

       If the Clerk of the Courts errs in good faith by selecting a
       Player to Judge a CFJ or Appeal, who:

       a) e believes at the time of selection to be eligible to judge the
          CFJ or Appeal; and
       b) is not eligible to judge the CFJ or Appeal at the time of
          selection solely because e is Turning Around And Around;
 
       then that selection shall stand and the selected Player shall
       become a Judge of that CFJ or Appeal, as if e had been eligible to
       judge it.
