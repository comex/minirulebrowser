Proposal #4147 by Wes, AI=1
What is Public?

Amend Rule 478 to read:

      A Public Forum is a medium of communication so designated by
      the Registrar. Sending a message to a Public Forum shall be
      considered the equivalent of sending that message to all
      Players.

      A Discussion Forum is a medium of communication so designated
      by the Registrar. A Discussion Forum shall never be a Public
      Forum and messages sent to a Discussion Forum are never
      considered to have been sent to all Players.

      The Registrar may designate a given medium of communication to
      be (or cease to be) a Public Forum or a Discussion Forum Without
      Objection. An announcement of such a designation shall be made
      via the medium whose designation is being changed. Any
      designation of a medium as a Public Forum shall also be
      announced via all existing Public Fora in addition to any
      other requirements.

      It is the responsibility of every Active Player to ensure that
      e is able to receive messages via each and every Public Forum.
      Any inability of a Player to receive messages via a particular
      Public Forum does not deprive that medium of its legal status
      as a Public Forum. Players are in no way required to receive
      messages via any particular Discussion Forum.

      The Registrar shall include as part of eir Report all media
      which are currently Public or Discussion Fora and sufficient
      data regarding each medium to allow new Players to receive
      messages via that medium.

      Any communication which has been sent via a Public Forum shall
      be considered to have been made publicly. Any communication
      which has been sent to all Players via some other medium, or
      combination of mediums, shall be considered to have been made
      publicly, provided it contains some clear designation that it
      is intended to be public.

      If the Rules require a Player to publish certain information,
      then e is considered to have satisfied that requirement at the
      time e publicly sends a message containing the information e is
      required to publish.

      If the Rules require a Player to announce certain information,
      that announcement must be made publicly.


Amend Rule 1686 to read:

      For each Office, the Rules may designate certain information to
      be part of that Office's Weekly Report or Monthly Report. All
      Weekly Reports and Monthly Reports shall also be known as
      Official Reports. All information which is part of an Officer's
      Official Report(s) shall be maintained by that Officer.

      Each Officer with a Weekly Report is required to publish that
      Report during each Nomic Week, else e shall be Guilty of the
      Class 2 Infraction of Failure to Report. Each Officer with a
      Monthly Report is required to publish that Report during each
      Nomic Month, else e shall be Guilty of the Class 2 Infraction
      of Failure to Report. The Infraction of Failure to Report may
      be detected and reported by the Grand Warden of the Oligarchy
      or the Speaker.

      If an Officer with a Weekly Report fails to publish that Report
      during three consecutive Nomic Weeks, e commits the Class
      10 Crime of Dereliction of Duty. If an Officer with a Monthly
      Report fails to publish that Report during three consecutive
      Nomic Months, e commits the Class 10 Crime of Dereliction of
      Duty. Any Officer found Guilty of Dereliction of Duty shall be
      immediately retired from Office. No player may be found Guilty
      of Dereliction of Duty more than once each quarter for any
      particular Office.


Amend Rule 1497 by replacing the following text:

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of any message sent to the Public Forum or
      in response to a request for information which that Player is
      required to provide commits the Class 4 Crime of
      Misrepresentation.

with the following text:

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect, either publicly or in response to a request for
      information which that Player is required to provide, commits the
      Class 4 Crime of Misrepresentation.


Amend Rule 1727 by replacing the following text:

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that Payroll Clerk shall transfer 25
      Stems from the Bank to each Player who, during Agora's
      Birthday, posts to the Public Forum a message recognizing
      Agora's Birthday; but no Player shall receive more than one
      such transfer during each year's Birthday Celebration;

with the following text:

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Payroll Clerk shall transfer
      25 Stems from the Bank to each Player who, during Agora's
      Birthday, publicly recognizes Agora's Birthday; but no Player
      shall receive more than one such transfer during each year's
      Birthday Celebration.

      Each Player is either On Hold or Off Hold at all times. When a
      Player Registers, e is Off Hold. This status may only be changed
      as specified in the Rules.

      "Active" and "Inactive" are unambiguous synonyms for "Off Hold"
      and "On Hold", respectively.

      An Inactive Player may become Active by publicly announcing that
      e does so.

      An Active Player may become Inactive by publicly announcing that
      e does so, provided e has been Inactive for at least 96 hours.


Amend Rule 1042 to read:

      Each Player is either Noisy, Quiet or Silent at all times. When
      a Player sends a public message, including a message requesting
      Registration, that Player becomes Noisy if e was not already
      Noisy.

      Any Player who has not caused another Player to become Quiet in
      the last 24 hours may cause another Active Noisy Player to
      become Quiet by publicly and clearly identifying the Player to
      be made Quiet.  If a Player has been Quiet continuously for two
      weeks, e becomes Silent. If a Player has been Inactive
      continuously for two months, e becomes Silent.

      Any Player may cause a Silent Player to become a Zombie by
      publicly stating that the Silent Player has Abandoned the Game.
      As soon as possible after this statement, the Registrar shall
      publicly confirm or deny that the Player has become a Zombie.

      If the Speaker becomes a Zombie, e commits the Class 15 Crime
      of Speaker Abandonment. E also ceases to be the Speaker and the
      Speaker-Elect becomes the Speaker.

      The Registrar shall include in eir Report the most recent
      date on which each Player changed from being Noisy, Quiet or
      Silent to any of the others.

Proposal #4148 by Kelly, AI=1
The Whole Truth

Rule 1497 is amended to read:

      Any Player who willfully makes a false statement of fact as part
      of evidence submitted in support of a Claim of Error, Call for
      Judgement, or Judgement, or in response to a Judicial or
      Appellate Order requiring that Player to disclose information
      known to that Player, commits the Class 10 Crime of Perjury.

      Any Player who willfully makes a false statement of fact as part
      of a public message, as any part of a response to a request for
      information where that Player was required to respond, or as
      part of a message to an Officer upon which that Officer is then
      required to act, commits the Class 4 Crime of Misrepresentation.

      For the purposes of this Rule, the Speaker shall be considered
      an Officer.

      For the purposes of this Rule, a false statement of fact is made
      "willfully" when the Player making it, at the time the statement
      was made, has the intention to make a false statement of fact
      and knowledge that the statement actually made was false.
      Particularly, a Player who makes a false statement of fact
      through excusable negligence, reasonable error, or reasonable
      reliance on the representations of another, shall not be
      considered to have willfully made a false statement of fact.

      A conclusion as to the interpretation of the Rules or their
      application to a particular situation is not a "statement of
      fact".

Proposal #4150 by Elysion, AI=1
Ambiguous Ordering Fix v1.1

[History:
      * 1.1:
        + Reworked the first paragraph to refer to actions
        + Clarified some sections
        + Implemented Blob's suggestion of "substantive results" ]

Amend rule 1527/2 (Timing of Multiple Events in One Message) to read:

      Whenever a message contains more than one action -- such as a
      notification, report, or other communication -- on which the Rules
      place some legal significance, the actions in that message shall
      be taken to have been sent sequentially in the order which they
      appear in the message.

      If a message attempts to perform multiple actions simultaneously
      without explicitly stating a specific order for the actions, then the
      attempt shall be considered ambiguous and without effect if the
      gamestate would be substantively different for any two orderings
      of the actions. For the purposes of this test, the actual order
      the actions are performed in is not considered substantive, but
      other differences may, at the discretion of a judge, be
      considered substantive.

Proposal #4152 by Murphy, AI=1
Criminal Simplification

Amend Rule 1503 (Crimes and Infractions) to read:

      An action or inaction is a Crime or an Infraction only if defined
      as such by the Rules.

      An entity may be convicted of a Crime only by a judicial finding
      that e has committed that Crime.  An entity may be convicted of
      an Infraction only by announcement of a Player authorized by the
      Rules to report the commission of that Infraction.

      The commission of a Crime or Infraction may be penalized only as
      defined by the Rules.

Repeal Rule 1815 (Crimes and Infractions without Penalties).

Amend Rule 1812 (Notices of Infraction) to read:

      If an entity (hereafter the Defendant) commits an Infraction, then any
      Player authorized by the Rules to report the commission of that
      Infraction may announce a Notice of Infraction.  This Notice shall
      explicitly specify the following:

        a) The Infraction that has been committed.
        b) The identity of the Defendant.
        c) The Rule(s) defining that action or inaction as an Infraction.
        d) The action of inaction by which the Defendant committed the
           Infraction.
        e) Whatever Orders are sufficient to impose the penalty for the
           Infraction.

      If a Claim of Error alleging that the Defendant did not commit the
      Infraction is admitted, then the Player who announced the Notice of
      Infraction shall vacate all Orders that e executed to impose the
      penalty for the Infraction.

Proposal #4153 by Michael, AI=1
Group Votes revised

Amend Rule 766 by replacing all the text following "A Group's Voting
Power on a Democratic Proposal is as follows:" with the following
TEXT-delimited text:

TEXT
  (a) A Group containing fewer than three members: zero;
  (b) A Group containing at least three members: the number of Players
      divided by the number of Groups with at least three members,
      rounded down.
TEXT

[Comment: a very simple change that
  * gives groups more votes;
  * encourages the formation of more groups;
  * ensures that group votes are not worth more than rougly a third of
    the total possible (there are generally as many VEs as Players);
  * is non-discriminatory.
]
