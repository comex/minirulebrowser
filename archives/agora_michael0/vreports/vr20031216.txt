Nondescript Proposal

Proposal 4544 by OscarMeyr, AI=1, Ordinary
Team Captains


Create a new rule, titled "Team Captains" of Power = 1, with the
following
text:

Leadership is a loose Team switch with values null and each of the
Team's
Members.  The Scorekeepor shall maintain and report records for this
switch.

If a Team's leadership is null, any Member of that Team may flip the
Team's
leadership, Without Objection from the other Members of that Team.

If a Team's leadership is non-null, the leadership identifies the Team
Captain,
who is the Executor of that Team.  The Captain may flip eir Team's
leadership
without restriction; any other Member of the Team may flip the Team's
leadership with N Supporters, where N + 1 is the minimal majority of
that
Team's Members.

If the Team Captain ceases to be a member of the Team, that Team's
leadership
becomes null.
