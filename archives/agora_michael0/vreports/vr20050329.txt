(At the beginning of the week in which these proposals were distributed:
   Maud's VPOP was 0
   Manu's VPOP was 1
   gazebo_dude's VPOP was 1
so some of their votes were ineffective.  gazebo_dude's votes in
parentheses may have also been ineffective, due to the "3xFOR" question
that AFAIK *still* remains unsettled by CFJ or Proposal; the subsequent
totals assume that e cast one effective vote on each proposal.)

Text of Adopted Proposals
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 4655 by Kolja, AI=1, Ordinary, Disinterested
Slow Play Reporting


Amend 1686 by replacing
"Each officer with a Weekly Report must publish it weekly; each"
with
"Each officer with a Weekly Report must publish it weekly unless the
content of the report would substantially be the same as in the
previously published report. In this case, a report must only be
published within one week of the next substantial change to the
report's content. Each"


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Proposal 4656 by Quazie, AI=2, Democratic, Disinterested
Tiny spelling error fix


Replace the following from R1841

"seven says"

with

"seven days"


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Proposal 4657 by Sherlock, AI=1, Ordinary
The University of Agora


[ V1.2 - Thanks to Quazie and root, again - there is now a check in
          place against outrageous Research Grant awards and also a
          guard against the same Card being checked out by different
          Players.

   V1.1 - Thanks to Quazie for suggestions and to root for a rewrite of
          the Library rules.  The Library works more like a book store
          now and should be effectively closed when Cards are frozen.
          Players may still request Cards during this time, however.

          I also rewrote some sections and renamed the Boons.

   V1.0 - Components of this proposal:

          - The University becomes a functioning Entity.
          - The Speaker assumes a role as President of the University.
          - The President may offer research grants to stimulate Agoran
            growth.  These are purposefully vague; I could see them
            ranging anywhere from "Write a proposal that cleans up typos
            in the Ruleset" to "Assemble an Agora website".
          - A monthly Book Club fosters public discussion of the rules.
          - The Library acts as a public resource for Cards.

          I envision the University as something that would grow over time.
          The basic framework is provided in this proposal along with three
          applications.  There are many more possibilities with this theme
          and I would encourage expansion of the campus by other Players
          if and when this passes.

          Thanks to Maud for some new phrasing in the Book Club section. ]

Rename the Rules Category "Degrees and Theses" to "The University of
Agora".

Create a rule entitled "The University of Agora":

     The University is an Entity.

     As President of the University, the Speaker is the sole Executor of
     the University, but may take no action on behalf of The University
     except as explicitly permitted by the Rules.

     Education is a stuck Player switch with values Student and Faculty
     Member.  The Herald shall flip the Education switch to Faculty
     Member for a Player as soon as possible after that Player is awarded
     a Degree.  The Herald is the recordkeepor of Education.

Create a rule entitled "Research Grants":

     The University offers Research Grants for projects that improve
     the intellectual, cultural and social life of Agora.  The Speaker
     may announce a Research Grant by publicly describing a task to be
     performed and stating a number between one and five.

     If another Player completes this task to the Speaker's satisfaction
     within the next month, the Speaker shall award to that Player an
     equal number of Boons of Achievement, without two objections.  No
     more than one Player may receive this award.  If more than one Player
     undertakes the task, the Speaker shall choose only one Player to
     receive the award.

Create a rule entitled "The University Book Club":

     The University sponsors a monthly Book Club.  During the first week
     of each month the first Player who publically specifies a rule as
     that month's Book Club Selection becomes the Moderator for the
     University Book Club.  The Assessor shall award one Boon of
     Refinement apiece to the Moderator and Proposer for the first passed
     proposal within the next thirty days that either amends or repeals
     this Selection.

Create a rule entitled "Gardner Library":

     The University (hereafter the Library) is a Gambler.  Whenever the
     Library has fewer than five Cards, the Deckmastor shall as soon as
     possible deal randomly chosen Cards to the Library until it has
     five cards.

     A Player (hereafter the Borrower) may check out a specified Card
     from the Library by paying a Fee for the Library's upkeep.  The
     fee is 2 Kudos for Students and 1 Kudo for Faculty Members.  The
     Card is considered reserved and may not be checked out by any
     Player until it is dealt to the Library again by the Deckmastor.

     As soon as possible after a Card is checked out from the Library
     and it is within the Speaker's ability to do so, the Speaker shall
     transfer the Card from the Library to the Borrower.

All Players who Bear a Degree at the time of the passing of this Proposal
immediately have their Education switches set to Faculty Member.

The Deckmastor shall as soon as possible after the passing of this
Proposal deal five randomly chosen cards to the Library.

Proposal 4658 by root, AI=1, Ordinary, Disinterested
Some Things Are More Trouble Than They're Worth


Amend Rule 1483 by deleting the text that reads:

      The delivery of text identical to another Proposal which was
      Proposed less than three weeks previous does not create a
      new Proposal unless accompanied by a clear and explicit
      indication that the intent was to Propose a duplicate Proposal.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Proposal 4659 by root, AI=1, Ordinary, Disinterested
Fix CFJ Linkage


[Linked CFJs become unlinked if the judge is automatically recused.
  They shouldn't.]

Amend Rule 2024 by replacing the text reading:

       If a Trial Judge is recused from a Linked CFJ, then it ceases to
       be Linked to any other CFJ.  If a Trial Judge is recused from
       two or more Linked CFJs in a single message, then those CFJs
       continue to be Linked to each other, but not to any other CFJs
       to which the Judge is still assigned.

with:

       If a Trial Judge is recused from a Linked CFJ, then it ceases to
       be Linked to any other CFJ.  If a Trial Judge is recused from
       two or more Linked CFJs in a single message, or if a Trial Judge
       is simultaneously and automatically recused from two or more
       Linked CFJs, then those CFJs continue to be Linked to each other,
       but not to any other CFJs to which the Judge is still assigned.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Proposal 4660 by root, AI=2, Democratic
Look Ma, No Hand-Waving (It's Invisibilitated)


A new rule with power 2 shall be created, with the text:

       Upon the creation of this rule, all unsatisfied requirements to
       discard one or more cards that arose from from Rule 2075/1 or Rule
       2083/0 prior to March 19, 2005 are hereby voided and are deemed to
       have never existed.


The same rule shall then be repealed.


Rule 2074 shall be amended to read:

       Flux is a stuck switch for Gamblers with states Free and Frozen.
       Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, a Gambler with frozen
       flux may not play, discard, or transfer cards from eir hand, nor
       may the Deckmastor satisfy pending draws for that hand. However,
       the Deckmastor may by public announcement discard cards from
       any Frozen Gambler as required by the Rules.

       The Deck's flux shall always be free, rules to the contrary
       notwithstanding.
