Assessor's Voting Report
Proposals 4213 - 4218

Proposal 4213 was not distributed on September 9 because the Promotor omitted
part of its text.  The previous Assessor's Voting Report for Proposal 4213 was
therefore without effect.

Due to Rule 376, Proposal 4213 takes effect last, because it was distributed
last.  This appears to have no practical effect.

       iv) E was not eligible to Judge the CFJ that resulted in the
           matter under consideration when it was called, and this
           restriction does not prevent three eligible Players from
           being selected by the CotC for the Board.

       iv) E is not eligible to Judge the CFJ that resulted in the

Proposal #4215 by neil, AI=1

Amend Rule 2003 by replacing each occurrence of the string
`Winderness' with `Wilderness'.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal #4217 by Syllepsis, AI=1
Building Arcadian Cities

1. Amend Rule 1998 "Land Topology" by appending the following
   paragraph:

Two Units of Land are said to be Connected by a specific Type or Subtype
of Land if it is possible to travel from the first Unit to the second by
Waddling only over Land of that specific Type or Subtype.

2. Create a rule "Developing Land" with Power=1 and the text:

A Player who owns a Unit of Land and is Located at that Unit of Land may
change the Land Type and/or Subtype in the following manner:

a) If the Unit of Land is of Type Wilderness, e may change that Unit of  
   Land to Type Farmland by expending 5 Movement Points and paying a 
   Fee of: 
     
     i)   0.1 BOS in Stems, rounded up, if the Unit is of Subtype 
          Forest; 
    
     ii)  0.25 BOS in Stems, rounded up, if the Unit is of Subtype 
          Desert; or 

     iii) 1 BOS in Stems, rounded up, if the Unit is of 
          Subtype Mountain. 

b) If the Unit of Land is of Type Farmland, e may change that Unit of 
   Land to Type Urbana by expending 5 Movement Points and paying a Fee 
   of:

     i)   0.1 BOS in Stems, rounded up, in which case the Unit will 
          have Subtype Road;

     ii)  0.25 BOS in Stems, rounded up, in which case the Unit will
          have Subtype Aqueduct; or

     iii) if there are no Units of subtype City within a Penguin 
          Distance of 3 from the Unit, The Unit is Connected to a Unit
          of Water by Aqueduct, and there are at least 8 Units of 
          Farmland within a Penguin Distance of 2 from the Unit, 1 BOS
          in Stems, in which case the Unit will have Subtype City. In
          this case the Player is required to give a unique name to the  
          City.

Units affected by this Rule take on the new Land Type at the beginning of
the next week, and all such changes shall be indicated in the Mapkeepor's
Report for that week. 


3. Create a Rule "Arcadian Cities" with the text:

A Unit of Land of Subtype City may be referred to as just a City, Arcadian
City, or by its unique name, if any.

The Unit of Land at (0,0) shall always remain a City. This city shall be
named Tripolis, the Capital of Arcadia, and shall always be Public Land,
owned by the Bank. This takes precedence over any Rule to the contrary.

Any City other than Tripolis ceases to be a City and becomes a Unit of
Land of Subtype Road whenever:

a) It is not Connected to Water by Aqueduct; or

b) There are less than 8 Units of Farmland within a Penguin Distance
   of 2 from the City.
