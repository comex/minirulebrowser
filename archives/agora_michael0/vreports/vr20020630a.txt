Proposal 4335 by Murphy, AI=1
Turning a Blind Eye

For the purpose of this Proposal, the Period In Question is the time
period beginning one second after Murphy was assigned as Trial Judge
of CFJ 1364, and ending on June 11, 2002, at 23:59:59 UTC.

Upon the adoption of this Proposal, the Game State becomes what it would
be if, for the entire Period In Question, Murphy had been ineligible to
be Trial Judge or Appelate Judge of any CFJ.

Upon the adoption of this Proposal, the Bank incurs a debt to Murphy
of 14 Stems.

Proposal 4337 by Sir Toby, AI=1
Money Grubbing Contests

Create a new rule with the title "Money Grubbing Contests" and the
following text:

      A Contest may be a Money Grubbing Contest if its ACO specifically
      states that it is a Money Grubbing Contest. A Player may not be the
      Contestsmaster of more than one Money Grubbing Contest in a single
      Nomic month.

Amend rule 1910 by replacing this text:

      (3) the transferor is an Organization, and the Stems to be
          transferred had not been held continuously by the
          Organization for one week.

with the following text:

      (3) the transferor is an Organization, and the Stems to be
          transferred had not been held continuously by the
          Organization for one week;
      (4) either the transferor or the transferee is a Money Grubbing
          Contest, and the regulations of the Contest(s) involved in the
          transfer specifically permit the transfer.
