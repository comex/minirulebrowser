In accordance with the Judgement of CFJ 1440, this should have read:

  4453 Teamwork                        Sherlock    1  D  PASSES 10  8  0 1

Here is the text of P4453:

Proposal 4453 by Sherlock, AI=3, Democratic
Teamwork

Create a Rule entitled "Teams" with this text:

      All Players are grouped into units known as Teams.  No Player
      may belong to more than one Team at any time.

      Each Team shall have a Team Name by which it is known.  A
      Player in a Team may change that Team's Team Name with the
      Support of two other Players in the same Team.

      A Team Score is at all times an integer.  The Team Score of a
      Team is the total sum of all Points of all Players grouped into
      that Team.

Create a Rule entitled "Team Wins" with this text:

      A Team achieves a Team Win when its Team Score reaches 400.

      The Scorekeepor shall make a public announcement of the Team Win
      as soon as possible after the Team Win is achieved.  The
      Scorekeepor shall then pay out 25 Stems to each Player in the
      winning Team.

      Upon the Scorekeepor's announcement, all Players' Scores are
      set to zero.

Create a Rule entitled "New Player Team Assignment" with this text:

      As soon as possible after a Player registers, the Scorekeepor
      shall assign em to a Team and publicly announce the assignment.
      The Scorekeepor shall make the assignment so as to distribute the
      players as evenly as possible among the teams. If more than one
      assignment would achieve this, the Scorekeepor may choose among
      them.

Amend rule 1928 (The Scorekeepor) to read:

      The Scorekeepor is an office; its holder is responsible for
      keeping track of scores and Teams.

      The Scorekeepor's Weekly Report shall include the score of each
      registered Player and all Team Scores as well as any changes
      to either since the last posting of the Report.

Upon adoption of this Proposal, all Player's Scores shall instantly be
set to zero.

Upon adoption of this Proposal, the Scorekeepor shall as soon as
possible group all registered Players into four Teams of 4-6 Players
apiece.  The Scorekeepor shall assign an initial Team Name to each of
these Teams.

Repeal Rule 766 (Groups).
Repeal Rule 716 (How to Form a Group).
Repeal Rule 719 (Joining a Group).
Repeal Rule 721 (The Vizier and the Ordinancekeepor).
Repeal Rule 718 (Resignation from a Group).

Amend Rule 1910 (Stems) to read:

      Stems are a Bank Currency.  The MUQ of Stems is 1.  The
      Recordkeepor for Stems is the Payroll Clerk.

      Transfers of Stems are permitted only if at least one of the
      following is true:

      (1) either the transferor or the transferee is the Bank;
      (2) the Stems are to be transferred from a Dissolute to a player
          who has the privilege of Looting the Corpse of that
          Dissolute;
      (3) either the transferor or the transferee is a Money Grubbing
          Contest, and the regulations of the Contest(s) involved in
          the transfer specifically permit the transfer.

      All other transfers of Stems are prohibited.

Amend Rule 1987 (Classes of Organizations) to read:

      The following Classes of Organizations exist:

        a) Contests.
        b) Monasteries.

Amend Rule 2003 (Actions in Arcadia), removing the part that reads:

      - If the entity is a Group, 1, plus 3 for every Member of the
        Group located on or adjacent to the location of the Group at
        the start of the week, plus 1 for every unit of Land with Gote
        owned by the Group at the start of the week.

Amend Rule 2003 (Actions in Arcadia), to read:

      Every week, the number of Actions Units an entity may expend to
      perform actions in the Land of Arcadia is as follows,

      - If the entity is a Player, 10, minus 1 for every 5 Blots in
        the Player's Stain as recorded in the most recent Herald's
        report before the week started, plus 1 for every unit of Land
        with Gote owned by the Player at the start of the week.

      - All other entities zero.

      Action Units are not transferable, and do not persist from one
      week to the next.

      An entity may expend Action Units to carry out an action in
      Arcadia by notifying the Mapkeepor of the specifics of the act.
      So long as e does not spend more than eir allotted number of
      Action Units, e may make as many actions e wishes in a single
      week.

      When an act specifies an alternating Land Type, the Land Type
      chosen will be based upon the Land Type used as the previous
      alternating Land Type, so that consecutive alternating Land
      Types alternate between Black and White. As soon as possible
      after a Player notifies the Mapkeepor of an act that specifies
      an alternating Land Type, the Mapkeepor must announce which Land
      Type was used for that act.

      Players may expend:

      * 2 Action Units to move from one Land Unit to an adjacent Unit
        if their Land Types are the same and the destination is not
        Aether.

      * 5 Action Units to move from one Land Unit to an adjacent Unit
        if their Land Types differ and the destination is not Aether;

      Any entity may expend:

      * 5 Action Units to set Land Type of a Land Unit which e owns to
        any Land Type other than Aether, whether or not e is located
        at that Land Unit.

      * 5 Action Units to set the Land Type of a random Land Unit that
        is adjacent to the Entity's current location, is of type
        Aether, and is owned by the Land Bureau, to an alternating
        Land Type.  The Mapkeepor will make the random determination.
        This action has no effect if there are no qualifying Land
        Units.  As soon as possible after a Player notifies the
        Mapkeepor of this move, the Mapkeepor must announce which Land
        Unit, if any, is changed by this action.  The change occurs at
        the time of the first legal announcement from the Mapkeepor
        declaring which Land Unit's Land Type has changed.

      * 10 Action Units to set the Land Type of the Entity's current
        location to any Land Type of eir choice other than Aether, if
        and only if the Unit is owned by the Land Bureau.

      * 10 Action Units to set the Land Type of any Land Unit that is
        of type Aether to an alternating Land Type.

      Unless explicitly permitted by other Rules, all other actions
      and moves in Arcadia are invalid.

Amend Rule 2022 (Sente and Gote) to read:

      On the fifteenth of each Agoran Month, the following actions
      occur in sequence, and these changes must be reported by the
      Mapkeepor as soon as possible after they occur:

         (i) Every Land Unit, excluding (0, 0), that is not directly
             connected to a unit of Aether, and is not connected by
             its own type to a unit of Aether, shall be transformed to
             Aether.

        (ii) Any entities whose locations are on land units so
             transformed shall have their locations set to 0,0.

       (iii) If any land unit so transformed is not property of the
             Land Bureau, it becomes property of the Land Bureau.

        (iv) If there are more Land Units of a single defined Land
             Type, Aether excepted, then there are of all other Land
             Types combined (other than Aether), then all Land Units
             of that majority Type are said to have Sente.  Land Units
             of all other defined Types are said to have Gote.

         (v) the Mapkeepor shall Pay Out:
             (a) an amount of Stems equal to the Minimum Income times
                 the Basic Officer's Salary to all Players whose
                 location has Sente;
             (b) to the owner of any Land Unit that has Sente and is
                 not owned by the Bank or the Land Bureau:
                     * if the Weather is Plenty, 3 Stems for each 5
                       Land Units with Sente that e owns;
                     * if the Weather is Fair, 2 Stems for each 5
                       Land Units with Sente that e owns;
                     * if the Weather is Foul, 1 Stem for each 5
                       Land Units with Sente that e owns;

      Sente and Gote shall only be changed as defined by this Rule, on
      the fifteenth of each Agoran Month.

Repeal Rule 112 (Ways to Win and Preclusions Thereof).
Repeal Rule 1931 (Winners' Stipend).
Repeal Rule 2014 (SemiGenii).
Repeal Rule 2015 (A Champion's Retirement).

Amend Rule 1893 (The Treasuror's Budget) to read:

      The Treasuror's Budget shall contain the Basic Officer Salary
      (BOS), an amount between 0 and 40 Stems inclusive.
      Additionally, the Budget shall contain the values all of the
      following compensations:

        (i)  the Minimum Income;
       (ii)  the Judicial Salary;
      (iii)  the Distributor's Gratuity;
       (iv)  the Speaker's Gratuity; and
        (v)  for each wage-earning Office, the Salary of that Office.

      A compensation shall be not less than 0 nor more than 4, and
      must be an integral multiple of 0.1.  The arithmetic mean of all
      compensations shall be no greater than 2.

      Whenever the Rules indicate that one of the above compensations
      is to be paid out, the amount to be paid out shall be the
      product of the value of the compensation and the value of the
      BOS (as set in the latest Budget).

      The Treasuror's Budget shall also contain a schedule that, for
      each Bank Currency, shall indicate the amount of the New Player
      Award for that Currency.  The amount of the New Player Award for
      a Bank Currency shall not be less than the Minimum Unit Quantity
      of that Currency.

      The Treasuror's Budget shall also contain the Foul Weather
      Factor and the Weather Intensity Factor. Both are numbers
      between 0 and 10 inclusive that are evenly divisible by 0.1.

      While holding the Office as Electee, the Treasuror may amend eir
      Budget, With Support.

Amend Rule 1922 (Defined Regular Patent Titles), removing the following
text:

      (e)  Groovy, which may be awarded to any Player Winning the Game
           at least once since the introduction of this Patent Title
           and demonstrating eir total coolness by Winning the Game at
           least once by each of at least three distinct win
           conditions.

Amend Rule 1929 (Points) to read:

      A Player's Score is a measure of that Player's unloserliness,
      measured in Points. The Score of each Player is at all times an
      integer. A Player who has not been Awarded or Penalized since
      the last Team Win has a Score of zero Points.

      The Rules may specify that certain events may cause a certain
      Player to be Awarded Points (causing eir Score to be increased)
      or Penalized Points (causing eir Score to be decreased). If said
      event occurs, then any Player may notify the Scorekeepor of the
      Award or Penalty. The Scorekeepor shall then note the change in
      the affected Player's Score.

      Such a notification must meet the following requirements, else
      it is ineffective:
         -- It must be sent within 7 days of the event
         -- It must unambiguously describe the event
         -- It must indicate the Rule allowing the Award or Penalty
         -- It must be the first such notification for that specific
            event

Amend Rule 1962 (Immaculate Players) to read:

      An Immaculate Player is a Player whose Stain is zero.
