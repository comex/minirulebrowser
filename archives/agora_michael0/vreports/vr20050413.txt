Proposal 4674 by OscarMeyr, AI=1, Ordinary
Fix Card Fees


Amend R2069 by replacing the text:
           A Gambler may Draw from The Deck for a Fee equal to the
           number of times that Gambler has previously Drawn from the
           Deck during the current month so long as the Gambler's Hand
           Size is smaller than the Maximum Hand Size plus the number
           of Offices e holds.  For the purposes of this Rule, the
           Speakership is considered an office.

With:
       A Gambler whose Hand Size is smaller than the maximum Hand Size,
       plus the number of Offices e holds, plus one if e is Speaker, may
       draw a card from The Deck.  The fee for this action is a number of

       Kudos equal to the number of times during the current month e has
       previously drawn a card in this manner.

Proposal 4675 by root, AI=2, Democratic, Disinterested
Fix Patronage 1.1


[Patronage requires Power 2 to do what it does.]

Change the power of Rule 2077 to 2, and amend it by replacing the text:

      * Caption:  Patronage
        Elements: Grafty, Budgeted
        Exploit:  You may increase or decrease the Political Charge by
                  N by paying a fee of 4 times N.  If undefined
                  elsewhere, the Political Charge is a positive
                  integer, tracked by the Assessor, which begins at 4.

with:

      * Caption:  Patronage
        Elements: Grafty, Budgeted, Powered [2]
        Exploit:  You may increase or decrease the Political Charge by
                  N by paying a fee of 4 times N.  If undefined
                  elsewhere, the Political Charge is a positive
                  integer, tracked by the Assessor, which begins at 4.
                  No fee required by the Powered [X] element need be
                  paid to activate this exploit.
