1. Create a rule entitled "Monks" with the text:

 "A player is Sanctimonious if e satisfies all of the following
 conditiions:

 1. E is not a Zombie.
 2. E is not a Zombie Master.
 3. E possesses less than four times the Basic Officer Salary of Stems.
 4. E does not possess any Voting Entitlements.
 5. E is a Senator.
 6. E is not the Executor or Limited Executor of any entity other than the
    Bank or Monastery which possesses Voting Entitlements, Zombies, or
    Stems.
 7. E is Immaculate.


 A Sanctimonious player becomes a Monk by notifying the Registrar that e
 becomes a Monk, provided that e has been Sanctimonious for at least one
 week. The condition of being a Monk is revoked upon the beginning of a
 Nomic Week after the dissatisfaction of any of the aforementioned
 conditions for at least 48 hours, if and only if a player reports this
 dissatisfaction to the Registrar before the beginning of the week.
 "


3. Amend Rule 1952 by adding the following text:

 " Any Monk may make any Undistributable Proposal in the Proposal Pool
 Distributable by publicly announcing that e is doing so and Paying a Fee
 of a number of Papyri equal to half the amount of the Distribution Cost of
 the Proposal, rounded up. "

4. Amend Rule 559 by adding the following text at the end of the Rule:

 "(viii) A list of Players who are Monks."

 /* This puts monk listings in the Registrar's report. */

Proposal #4196 by neil, AI=1
Fix Credit Limits

Amend Rule 1985 (``The Usuror's Budget'') by replacing the text:

       (iii) The Credit Limit for Stems which is a multiple of the
             Basic Officer Salary, between 0 and 10 inclusive.

        (iv) The Credit Limit for each Bank currency, other than Stems,
             which is a multiple of the MUQ of that Currency between 0
             and 10 inclusive.

with:

       (iii) The Player Credit Limit for Stems, which is a multiple of the
             Basic Officer Salary, between 0 and 10 inclusive.

        (iv) The Non-Player Entity Credit Limit for Stems, which is a
             multiple of the Basic Officer Salary, between 0 and 10
             inclusive.

         (v) The Player Credit Limit for each Bank currency, other than
             Stems, which is a multiple of the MUQ of that Currency
             between 0 and 20 inclusive.

        (vi) The Non-Player Credit Limit for each Bank currency, other
             than Stems, which is a multiple of the MUQ of that Currency
             between 0 and 20 inclusive.


Amend Rule 1978 (``Credit and Credit Limits'') to read:

       The credit in a given currency of an entity with Bond Issuance
       Authority is equal to the sum of the values of all Bonds owned
       by the Bank issued by that entity with a face value in that
       currency. The Usuror's Weekly Report shall list the credit in
       each currency of each non-Bank entity with Bond Issuance
       Authority, if that credit is greater than zero.

       The sale of a Bond is permitted only if one of the following is
       the case:
          * it is issued by the Bank.
          * it is issued by a player and would not cause the issuer's
            credit to exceed the Player Credit Limit in the currency
            in question as set forth in the Usuror's Budget.
          * it is issued by a non-Player entity other than the Bank
            and would not cause the issuer's credit to exceed the
            Non-Player Credit Limit in the currency in question as
            set forth in the Usuror's Budget.

       The Credit Limit for non-Bank currencies is 0.
