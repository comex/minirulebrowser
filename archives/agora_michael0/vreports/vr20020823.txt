-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 4366 by Steve, AI=3
Protect the Voting System

This Proposal has an AI of 3.

Create a Rule entitled "Votes are Protected" with Power = 3 which reads:

       Any Proposal that, as all or part of its effect, would change an
       entity's vote on an Issue for which the voting period has begun
       but for which no official voting report has been published at the
       time of the Proposal's adoption shall be wholly without effect,
       any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

       Once an official voting report has been published for that Issue,
       no votes on that Issue may be changed or cancelled, and the
       outcome of the Issue may not be changed in any way, any Rule to
       the contrary notwithstanding. Nothing in this Rule shall be
       construed as preventing the correction of errors in reporting the
       results of voting on Issues.

Proposal 4367 by Steve, AI=2
Scaling Down
 
This Proposal has an Adoption Index of 2.
 
[PREAMBLE: Auctions are more tactically interesting when the absolute
value of bids is lower. I therefore propose to scale down all Stem
values in the game by a factor of 5.]
 
When this Proposal takes effect, the changes listed below occur. Where
division required by these changes results in a fractional remainder,
the result is rounded up.
 
1. The Basic Officer Salary is set to 10 Stems.
2. The Stem component of the New Player Award is set to 24 Stems.
3. Four-fifths of the Stems held by each entity are destroyed.
4. The amount of all debts denominated in Stems is divided by 5.
5. If, prior to this Proposal taking effect, an entity has transferred
   Stems to another entity for the purpose of satisfying a debt or paying
   a Fee, and this transfer has conferred upon the transferor a right,
   not yet exercised, to demand the return of those Stems under the
   provisions of R1598(f), then subsequent to this Proposal's taking
   effect, this right is limited to the demand for the return of
   one-fifth of those Stems.
6. The value of all bids in ongoing Auctions for which the Auction
   Currency is Stems is divided by 5. This does not include Raffles.
7. The Bank incurs a debt of 5 Stems to the Payroll Clerk, as
   compensation for the extra work imposed on em by this Proposal.
 
Amend Rule 1727 (Happy Birthday) by replacing:
   the text "50 Stems" with the text "10 Stems",
   the text "25 Stems" with the text "5 Stems", and
   the text "100 Stems" with the text "20 Stems".
 
Amend Rule 1664 (Rebellion) by replacing the text "40 Stems" with the
text "8 Stems".
 
Amend Rule 1893 (The Treasuror's Budget) by replacing the text "200
Stems" with the text "40 Stems".
 
Amend Rule 947 (Bonus for Repeal) by replacing both occurrences of the
text "30 Stems" with the text "6 Stems".

Amend Rule 2022 (Sente and Gote) by replacing the text in which
currently reads:
 
             (b) to the owner of each Land Unit that has Sente as is
                 not owned by the Bank or the Land Bureau
                     * 3 Stems if the Weather is Plenty;
                     * 2 Stems if the Weather is Fair;
                     * 1 Stem if the Weather is Foul.
 
with text which reads:
 
             (b) to the owner of any Land Unit that has Sente and is
                 not owned by the Bank or the Land Bureau:
                     * if the Weather is Plenty, 3 Stems for each 5
                       Land Units with Sente that e owns;
                     * if the Weather is Fair, 2 Stems for each 5
                       Land Units with Sente that e owns;
                     * if the Weather is Foul, 1 Stem for each 5
                       Land Units with Sente that e owns;
 
[comment: I have a separate intention to repeal this Rule, but I might
as well make "Scaling Down" and "Land Bust" independent of each other.]
