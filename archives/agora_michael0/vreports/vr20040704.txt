Text of Adopted Proposals
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 4589 by Murphy, AI=1, Democratic
Fix Nominating with Budgets


Amend Rule 1958 (Nominating with Budgets) by replacing this text:

        (d) When the voting period begins, the vote collector shall
            announce each candidate's last valid proto-budget.

        (e) When the voting period ends, the winner's last valid
            proto-budget becomes the budget of that office, and e shall
            announce it as soon as possible. If the election ends
            without a winner, then the existing Budget remains in
            effect.

with this text:

        (d) As soon as possible after the end of the nominating period,
            the vote collector shall announce each candidate's last
            valid proto-budget.

        (e) When the election ends, the winner's last valid proto-budget
            becomes the budget of that office, and the winner shall
            announce it as soon as possible.  If the election ends
            without a winner, then the existing budget remains in
effect.

Upon the adoption of this Proposal, the gamestate becomes what it would
be if, whenever an Election for Office ended with a winner and a valid
proto-budget, but without a Voting Period, the proto-budget became the
budget for that Office.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Proposal 4590 by Elysion, AI=2, Democratic, Disinterested
Fixed Stalled Proposals


Amend rule 1933 by replacing the string

"Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, a Stalled Proposal may not be

with

"Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, a Proposal is Undistributable
while it is Stalled."


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Proposal 4592 by Murphy, AI=1, Democratic
Judicial Separation


Change the title of Rule 1450 (Speaker Cannot Stay CotC or Justiciar) to
"Judicial Separation", and amend it to read:

      Whenever the Speaker is Electee to the Office of Clerk of
      the Courts, e is retired from that Office.

      Whenever the Speaker is Electee to the Office of Justiciar,
      e is retired from that Office.

      Whenever a Player is both Clerk of the Courts and Justiciar,
      e is removed from the Office of Justiciar.

      Neither the Speaker, the Justiciar, nor a nominee for Justiciar
      may be nominated for Clerk of the Courts.

      Neither the Speaker, the Clerk of the Courts, nor a nominee
      for Clerk of the Courts may be nominated for Justiciar.

Amend Rule 910 (The Justiciar) by removing this text:

      Neither the Speaker nor the Clerk of the Courts (CotC) may
      nominate for the office of Justiciar; if the Justiciar ever
      becomes CotC, e is removed from the office of Justiciar.

Amend Rule 1647 (The Speaker-Elect) by removing this text:

      The Clerk of the Courts and Justiciar cannot be Nominated for
      the Office of Speaker-Elect.
