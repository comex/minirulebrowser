Text of Adopted Proposals
----------------------------------------------------------------------


Proposal 4861 by Goethe, AI=1, Ordinary
The Speaker is Proclaimed by The People


Proposal:  The Speaker is Proclaimed by The People

[Conflict of interest between ADoP and Speaker removed.  For
 separation of powers, automatic retirement of ADoP and CotC upon
 becoming speaker is unchanged for now].

[Differs from Murphy's Pope Drew I.  Pope Drew I protects against an
 ADOP who tries to make a pope illegally, but does not protect against
 an ADOP who refuses to announce a pope.]

Amend Rule 402 (Church and State) to read:

     A cardinal is an active, ready player who is not the current
     Speaker.

     For seven days after a cardinal wins the game with no other
     players simultaneously winning, that cardinal may announce that
     e becomes a pope.  Upon this announcement, that player becomes a
     pope, so please treat em right good forever.

     When a cardinal becomes a pope, any previous pope immediately
     ceases being a pope.  Whenever a pope is not a cardinal, e
     immediately ceases being a pope.

     Any Player who is not a pope may install the pope as Speaker, by
     announcement.  Upon this announcement, if the announced player
     is still a pope, then the current Speaker ceases to be Speaker,
     and the pope is installed as the new Speaker and ceases to be a
     pope.

     This installation cannot be performed if there are unresolved
     challenges regarding the pope-ness of the player.  If the
     legality of an installation is not challenged within seven days
     of it being attempted, then it shall be allowed to stand, even
     if is subsequently found to be illegal.

Proposal 4862 by OscarMeyr, AI=1, Ordinary
Update "Everybody Gets One"


Amend the Exploit of the card Everybody Gets One in the Blueprint
Cardbook by replacing the sentence:

  Gain one draw for each card you give away, plus one draw for
playing this card.

With the sentence:

  Gain one white chip for each card you give away, plus one white
chip for playing this card.


----------------------------------------------------------------------


Proposal 4863 by Goethe, AI=2, Democratic
Chamber fix


Chamber fix

proposal:  Chamber fix

[Changes in v1.0: Put in Maud's wording, added Speaker ability to
 unstall with support.  In terms of crime, I don't generally like to
 add them for things that we can undo (e.g., "that's against the
 rules, so it didn't happen").  For good reasons, distributing a
 stalled proposal still happens, so that's a case where it's worth
 having something to prevent the Promoter from distributing something
 against the rules just cause e can.]

Amend Rule 1933 to read:

     Chamber is a stuck proposal switch with values ordinary and
     democratic.

     An ordinary proposal with an adoption index of two or greater is
     stalled.  Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, a stalled
     proposal is undistributable, and if a proposal is distributed
     that was stalled at the time of distribution, its chamber shall
     immediately and automatically be set to democratic.  If the
     Promotor knowingly distributes a stalled proposal, e commits the
     class 4 crime of Improper Debate.

     Any player can flip the Chamber of a stalled proposal to
     democratic without objection.  The Speaker can flip the Chamber
     of a stalled proposal to democratic with support.
