Proposal 4761 by root, AI=1, Democratic, Sane
Limit Proposal Rewards


[Some of these rewards for adopted proposals are getting out of hand.]

Amend the rule titled "The Assessor's Boon Duties" by
replacing the text reading:

          * If a Proposal passes, and that Proposal was submitted by a
            Player within that Player's Grace Period, then the Assessor
            shall award the Proposor the Boon of Prodigy.

with:

          * If a Proposal passes, and that Proposal was submitted by a
            Player within that Player's Grace Period, then the Assessor
            shall award the Proposor the Boon of Prodigy, unless the
            Proposor has already received five or more such awards.


Amend rule 2080 to read:

       If a Proposal is adopted, the Proposer may draw from the deck by
       announcing the Proposal number while drawing; so long as the
       Proposer's Hand Size is smaller than the Maximum Hand Size plus
       the number of Offices e holds, the Proposer performs the draw
       within a week after the proposal's adoption, and the Proposer
       has not already done so for the same proposal.
