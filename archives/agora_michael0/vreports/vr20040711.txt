Text of Adopted Proposals
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 4598 by Elysion, AI=2, Democratic
Eliminate Redundant Kudos


Amend rule 2047 (Kudos) by removing the text reading:

      Agora, as a whole, also has a defined number of Kudos.  No other
      non-Player entity has a defined number of Kudos.


Amend rule 1941 (Fees) by replacing the sentence:

      Upon said announcement, the action is performed,
      the Actor's kudos are decreased by the fee, and Agora's kudos
      are increased by the fee.

with:

      Upon said announcement, the action is performed,
      the Actor's kudos are decreased by the fee.

and deleting the text "(and Agora)"


Amend rule 2051 (Tabla Rasa) by replacing the text reading:

      (B) set Agora's kudos equal to the Tabla Rasa times
          the current number of Players;

      (C) revoke all ephemeral Patent Titles.

with:

      (B) revoke all ephemeral Patent Titles.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Proposal 4599 by root, AI=2, Democratic, Disinterested
Fix Chamber-Changing


Amend Rule 2021 (Chamber Procedure) by changing it to read:

      (a) The Chamber Fee for a Proposal is a Fee for changing the
          Chamber of a Proposal.  For any given Proposal, the Chamber
          Fee is initially 1.  When a Proposal's Chamber is changed
          via this Rule, the Chamber Fee for the Proposal is doubled.

      (b) An Untainted Speaker, with 2 Supporters, may Sanitise a
          Distributed Proposal that is not already Sane and for which
          the Voting Period has not ended. If the Speaker Sanitises a
          Proposal, the Proposal is Aborted as described elsewhere;
          the Proposal remains Distributable, but becomes Democratic
          and Sane.


Amend Rule 1933 (A Proposal's Chamber) by appending the text:

      Whenever a Proposal's Chamber is changed while the Proposal is
      in its Voting Period, it is Aborted as described elsewhere and
      returned to the Proposal Pool with its Distributability and
      other characteristics intact.
