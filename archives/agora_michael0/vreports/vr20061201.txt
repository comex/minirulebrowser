I take up the role of vote collector for Proposals 4874 and 4875 (deadline on
4875 passed yesterday).

Proposal 4874 RESULTS
FOR:      Eris, Maud, root, Goethe*, Sherlock**
AGAINST:  OscarMeyr, The Grey Knight
PRESENT:  Quazie***
AI:       4
VI:       5/2
Result:   FAILS

*Goethe's vote:
> I vote FOR, if I don't vote AGAINST.
Goethe didn't vote against, so this vote is counted FOR.

**Sherlock's second vote:
> I vote FOR if Goethe votes FOR, and PRESENT if Goethe voted FOR.
Did not retract previous FOR vote, which stands.  Ballots must be retracted.

***Quazie:
> I vote AGAINST if I vote AGAINST, PRESENT if i can change my vote, and FOR...
"If I can change my vote" is taken as reasonble ackknowledgement of retraction
and re-vote.  Other clauses aren't.

Note that no interpretation of these above conditionals would have changed
the result from FAILED.


Proposal 4875 RESULTS
FOR:     root, Eris, Murphy, Goethe, Quazie*
AGAINST: OscarMeyr, Maud
PRESENT: Sherlock
AI:      1
VI:      5/2
Result:  ADOPTED

*Quazie's vote:
> I vote FOR 4875, if Maud votes AGAINST 4875.
is straightforward.

TEXT OF ADOPTED PROPOSALS:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 4875 by Goethe, AI=1, Ordinary
If 2.0


Enact the following rule entitiled Conditional Votes:

      A ballot option (vote) on an Agoran decision may be
      submitted conditionally, and the truth or falsity of
      the condition and thus the selected option will be
      determined as it exists at the end of the voting period.

      The option selected shall be considered to be clearly
      identified if and only if the truth or falsity of the
      specified condition(s) can be reasonably determined,
      without circularity or paradox, from information
      published within the voting period.
