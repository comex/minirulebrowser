Proposal 4867 by Goethe, AI=3, Democratic
Judicial Reform 2.0
PROPOSAL TEXT
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal:  Judicial Reform 2.0

[Only changed rights (R101).]
[Major philosophical change: Crimes and Infractions become a matter of
Contract Law.  Not much shorter (a little)].

The Rulekeepor is hereby requested to place Rules in categories as
indicated by this Proposal, in the order indicated in this Proposal,
which may involve the creation of new categories, moving of rules, or
the deletion of categories.  Some rules are included for reference and
indication of new placement without being actually amended.


======================================================================


Rename Rule 101 to "Agoran Rights and Privileges" and amend it to
read:

       The rules may define persons as possessing specific rights or
       privileges.  Be it hereby proclaimed that no binding agreement
       or interpretation of Agoran law may abridge, reduce, limit, or
       remove a person's defined rights.  A person's defined privileges
       are assumed to exist in the absense of an explicit, binding
       agreement to the contrary.  This rule takes precedence over any
       rule which would allow restrictions of a person's rights or
       privileges.

        i. Every person has the privilege of doing what e wilt.

       ii. Every player has the right to perform an action which is not
           regulated.

      iii. Every person has the right to invoke judgement, appeal a
           judgement, and to initiate an appeal on a sentencing or
           judicial order binding em.

       iv. Every person has the right to refuse to become party to
           a binding agreement.  The absense of a person's explicit,
           willful consent shall be considered a refusal.

        v. Every person has the right to not be considered bound by
           an agreement, or an amendment to an agreement, which e has
           not had the reasonable opportunity to review.

       vi. Every player has the right of participation in the fora.

      vii. Every person has the right to not be penalized more than
           once for any single action or inaction.

     viii. Every player besides the Speaker has the right to deregister
           rather than continue to play.

     Please treat Agora right good forever.

======================================================================
Contract Law
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 1742 (Agreements between Players) to read:

       Players may make agreements among themselves with the intention
       that such agreements will be binding; i.e. that they become
       parties to the agreement and agree to be bound by the agreement.

       A CFJ that alleges that a specific person (the Defendant) has
       broken an agreement is a Civil CFJ, for which the Caller is the
       Plaintiff.  A CFJ that is not a Civil CFJ is a General CFJ.

       If the judge of a Civil CFJ finds that the agreement was entered
       into with the intention that the agreement be binding, and that
       the agreement has in fact been broken, then e may do any or all
       of the following:

          (i) order the defendant to perform according to the agreement
              or perform substitute acts that would fairly serve the
              interests of the agreement;
         (ii) order the other parties of the agreement to perform such
              acts as may be necessary to preserve fairness and
              justice;
        (iii) order that additional ("punitive") penalties or actions
              be applied to the defendant, if and only if the agreement
              in question explicitly specifies punitive penalties for
              the type of breach.

       If a Civil CFJ is called by anyone who is not party to that
       agreement, then it lacks standing and shall be dismissed.  A
       Civil CFJ that specifies multiple defendants, or multiple
       independent breaches of contract, is improperly made and shall
       be dismissed.

       Nothing in this rule shall be construed so as to impair the
       enforcement of an agreement which requires a Player to violate
       another agreement.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 1503 (Crimes and Infractions) by naming it "Rules
Violations", setting its Power to 3, and amending it to read:

       In general, the Rules shall be adjudicated as if the Rules were
       a binding agreement between all Players, entered into by every
       player as a part of becoming a Player.  An actual or alleged
       Rule violation shall be treated as the violation of a binding
       agreement to be bound by the Rule or Rules in question.

       The proposal, fora, and registration processes shall, prima
       facie, be considered to be protective of a Player's rights and
       privileges with respect to making and changing the agreement to
       be bound by the rules.

       Other rules may further differentiate the treatment of rules
       violations from the treatment of violations of other types of
       agreements.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Increase the power of Rule 2109 (Agoran Contracts) to 2 and amend it
to read:

       There exists a type of binding agreement known as Agoran
       Contract.  An Agoran Contract may only be created or amended by
       a Proposal and becomes effective when the Proposal takes effect.

       Unless otherwise specified in the Rules, all Players are bound
       by Agoran Contracts and no Player may leave an Agoran Contract
       while remaining a Player.  The Proposal process shall, prima
       facie, be considered to be protective of a Player's rights and
       privileges with respect to agreements.

       All Rules regulating Contracts that are inconsistent with this
       Rule are superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.

       The CotC is required to keep track of all Agoran Contracts.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 1626 (Applications) to read:

       An Application is any document, which has been submitted as an
       Application by some person, to a Player designed by the Rules to
       receive Applications of that particular type.  The submittor is
       known as the Application's Sponsor.

       The Sponsor of an Application may attach the signatures of other
       persons, or signatories, to the Application at the time e
       submits it.  The Sponsor may not attach any signature to an
       Application without first having obtained the explicit consent
       of the signatory.  A signatory may revoke eir consent, once
       granted, by informing the Sponsor before submission.

       Signatures are presumed to have been attached with the consent
       of the signatory.  This presumption shall be rebutted only by a
       declaration from the alleged signatory, made within 60 days of
       the submission of the Application, stating that the signatory
       did not consent or that e consented and then subsequently
       revoked eir consent.  The Sponsor bears the burden of proof to
       show that such a declaration, once made, is false.

Repeal Rule 2107 (Contracts)
Repeal Rule 2108 (Contract Maintenance)

======================================================================
Rule Violations
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 1504 (Sentencing Orders) to read:

       Upon a finding in a Civil CFJ that the defendant has broken one
       or more Rules, the Trial Judge must execute exactly one of the
       following types of sentencing orders as punitive damages:

       (1) Without Objection and with 1 Support, an order the defendant
           to make a formal apology;
       (2) Without 2 Objections and with 2 Supporters, an order for the
           defendant to perform a specified service for the benefit of
           the Agoran community proportinate to the seriousness of the
           breach;
       (3) An order for the Herald to place the defendant in the Chokey
           for a number of months equal to the power of the highest
           powered Rule that was broken;
       (4) If and only if the trial judge finds the defendant to to
           have acted willfully in breaking the rules, an order for the
           Herald to place the defendant in the Chokey for twice number
           of months equal to the power of the highest-powered Rule
           that was broken;
       (5) If and only if the judge finds the defendant to have acted
           egregiously, maliciously, or with a consistent pattern of
           abuse, with Agoran Consent, an order for the Registrar to
           deregister the defendant in disgrace (make em lawless).  An
           order to be made lawless is automatically appealed upon its
           initial execution.

       These punishments are considered ranked with "worse" punishments
       being later in the list.

       If an attempted sentencing order does not receive the proper
       support or receives too many objections, the trial judge must
       execute another type of sentencing order.

       No other punitive damages may be assessed for Rules violations.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 908 (Formal Apologies) to read:

       A sentencing order may require a defendant (hereafter the Ninny)
       to publish a Formal Apology.

       A Formal Apology must be at least 200 words, and must explain
       the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire for
       self-improvement.  Furthermore, the Order to Apologize may
       include up to ten Prescribed Words of the Judge's choice, all of
       which must appear in the Formal Apology.

       A defendant must obey an Order to Apologize within 72 hours of
       its execution.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 1505 (Standard Classes of Crimes and Infractions) to be
called "Dishonor Rolls" and amend it to read:

       When the Herald is ordered to place someone in the Chokey, e
       shall publically award em the patent title "In the Chokey".

       This title shall be automatically revoked after a length of time
       indicated by the sentencing order, and the Herald shall announce
       the revokation.  If a sentencing order is executed against a
       defendant who already holds this title, the length of time of
       the new sentencing order shall be added to the time left on any
       previous ones.

       A person is considered to be In Disgrace while in the Chokey,
       between the execution and satisfaction of any sentencing orders
       binding em, or if deregistered for lawlessness.  A person who
       leaves the game in disgrace shall be awarded the Patent Title
       Fugitive by the Herald.  A Player may revoke the title Fugitive
       from emself as long as e is no longer in Disgrace.  A non-player
       may have this title revoked by Agoran Consent.

       The rules may further specify actions prohibited to persons in
       particular types of disgrace.

       The Herald is encouraged to publish lists of those in disgrace
       separate from patent titles of honor, to indicate the disgrace.

When this Proposal takes effect, all persons who were fugitives when
this proposal was adopted are hereby awarded the patent title
Fugitive.

======================================================================
Calling for Judgement
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 991 (Invoking Judgement) to read:

       Any person may request formal resolution of a dispute pertaining
       to this Nomic by submitting a Call for Judgement (CFJ) to the
       Clerk of the Courts.  The submission of a CFJ constitutes proof
       of the existence of such a dispute.

       A CFJ should be a single clearly-labeled Statement whose truth
       or falsity can be determined using logical reasoning, assuming
       perfect knowledge.  A CFJ may be accompanied by Arguments,
       Evidence, or other related material; the Judge is encouraged,
       but not required, to take notice of these things.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 897 (Barring Players from Judgement) to be called "Court
Procedure" and amend it to read:

       The Clerk of the Courts shall publish the text of a CFJ, along
       with any additional material submitted by the Caller and the
       Defendant if any (including but not limited to Arguments and
       Evidence), no later than the time e announces the identity of
       the first Judge assigned to that CFJ.

       When a Civil CFJ is submitted, the Clerk of the Courts shall
       publish the text of the CFJ and send a copy of the CFJ to the
       Defendant's registered e-mail address, if any, and inform the
       Defendant that e has one week to publish a defense and/or bar a
       Player from judging as described below.

       The CotC will not assign a Civil CFJ to a judge until one week
       has passed since after a publication.  During this time, any
       evidence or arguments, published or submitted to the CotC by the
       Defendant with the clear intent of being part of a defense, will
       become part of the material of that CFJ.

       A Player Barred from Judging a CFJ is ineligible to Judge that
       CFJ.

       When submitting a general CFJ, the Caller may Bar up to three
       Players from Judging that CFJ.

       The defendant of a Civil CFJ is automatically barred from
       judging it. The Plantiff may bar one other Player when e submits
       the CFJ.  The Defendant may bar one other Player from judging
       any time before the CFJ is assigned to a judge.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 2024 (Linked Statements) to read as follows:

       Linked CFJs are multiple Calls for Judgement that are submitted
       in a single message and clearly labelled as Linked CFJs.

       The Clerk of the Courts shall assign a Judge to a set of Linked
       CFJs, as if they were a single CFJ.  The Judge must be eligible
       to Judge each of the Linked CFJs, and is simultaneously assigned
       as Judge of each of the Linked CFJs.

       A Judge (the first judge) may transfer a CFJ to a second judge
       by announcement, thus linking the first and second CFJs and
       unlinking the first CFJ with any it was previously linked to,
       with the second judge's consent and provided the second judge
       has not been barred or recused from the first CFJ.

       The Judge of a set of Linked CFJs shall submit eir Judgement of
       each of those CFJs in a single message.

       If one or more Linked CFJs beyond the first are unrelated in
       subject matter to the first, then a Trial Judge may remand those
       CFJs to the Clerk of the Courts; e ceases to be Judge of those
       CFJs.

       If a Trial Judge is recused from a Linked CFJ, then it ceases to
       be Linked to any other CFJ.  If a Trial Judge is recused from
       two or more Linked CFJs in a single message, or if a Trial Judge
       is simultaneously and automatically recused from two or more
       Linked CFJs, then those CFJs continue to be Linked to each
       other, but not to any other CFJs to which the Judge is still
       assigned.

       A CFJ made by a person who has previously made five or more CFJs
       during the same Agoran Week is an Excess CFJ.  The Clerk of the
       Courts may dismiss any Excess CFJ.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Repeal Rule 1562 (Excess CFJs).
Repeal Rule 2025 (Transfer of Jurisdiction).

======================================================================
Selecting a Judge
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 1868 (Selecting a Judge) to read:

       A CFJ is open if it has not been Judged, or if an outstanding
       judicial motion pertaining to it has been neither granted nor
       denied.  A CFJ is closed if it is not open.

       As soon as possible after becoming aware that an open CFJ has no
       Judge assigned to it, the Clerk of the Courts shall choose a
       Player eligible to Judge it, and announce them as its Trial
       Judge.  That Player remains the Trial Judge of that CFJ until e
       is recused from it or becomes ineligible to Judge it.

       Other rules may explicitly delay the timing requirement of
       making assignments, for example with respect to providing the
       Defendant with response time in a Civil CFJ.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 698 (Always an Eligible Judge) to read:

       (a) Each active player is eligible to judge a given Call for
           Judgement (CFJ), unless a rule specifically makes em
           ineligible.

       (b) If the Clerk of the Courts is required to select a Judge,
           but after taking all other rules affecting eligibility into
           account, no player is eligible to judge that CFJ, then:

           (1) all non-barred players become eligible to judge that
               CFJ; then

           (2) if there is still no player eligible to judge, then all
               barred players, other than the caller emself, become
               eligible to judge that increasingly annoying CFJ; then

           (3) if there is still no player eligible to judge, then
               don't panic.  Somebody's bound to register someday; let
               em deal with it.

       (c) This rule takes precedence over other rules concerning who
           is and is not eligible to judge CFJs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 1871 (Turns for All) to read:

       Whenever a player is selected as Trial Judge of a CFJ, e becomes
       turned.  Turned players are ineligible to be Trial Judge of any
       future CFJs.  When a player registers, e is considered turned.

       Whenever an open CFJ has no Trial Judge assigned to it, and
       there are no players eligible to be assigned, the Clerk of the
       Courts shall publish a Notice of Rotation, specifying at least
       one such CFJ.  Upon such an announcement, all turned players
       become unturned.

       The CotC may turn a player e expects to judge CFJs slowly or not
       at all, without 2 objections.

       If the Clerk of the Courts errs in good faith by selecting a
       Player to Judge a CFJ or Appeal who is not eligible to judge
       that CFJ or Appeal solely because e is turned, then that
       selection shall stand, unless the Clerk of the Courts points out
       eir error and makes a new selection before the selected Player
       returns Judgement.

Delivering Judgement
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 591/18 (Power=1)
Legal Judgements

       The Judge of a CFJ Judges it by submitting eir Judgement to the
       Clerk of the Courts.  "Decision", "Finding", and "Response" are
       unambiguous synonyms for "Judgement".

       For a Trial Judge, a Judgement is exactly one of the following:
       TRUE, FALSE, or DISMISSED.

       As soon as possible after receiving a Judgement, the Clerk of
       the Courts shall publish it, along with any arguments, evidence,
       or other material included with the Judgement.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 408 (Late Judgement) to read:

       For each Judge assigned to a CFJ, eir Deliberation Period begins
       when the Clerk of the Courts announces eir assignment, and lasts
       seven days; eir Overtime Period begins when eir Deliberation
       Period ends, and lasts seven days.

       During a Judge's Overtime Period, if e has not yet Judged the
       CFJ, then the Clerk of the Courts may recuse em by announcement.

       Upon the end of a Judge's Overtime Period, if e has not yet
       Judged the CFJ, then the Clerk of the Courts shall recuse em by
       announcement as soon as possible.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Increase the power of Rule 217 (Judgements Must Accord with the Rules)
to 3 and amend it to read:

       All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however, if
       the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the Statement
       to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider game custom, common
       sense, past Judgements, and the best interests of the game
       before applying other standards.

       When a Judge is considering eir Judgement of a Statement
       contained in a CFJ, e shall make eir evaluation based on the
       truth or falsity of the Statement at the time the CFJ was
       issued.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 1575 (Standards of Proof) to read:

       Unless otherwise specified, all Judgements shall be consistent
       with the preponderance of the evidence.

       A defendant may not be assessed punitive damages for Rules
       Violations any worse than a formal apology, unless a Judge finds
       that evidence for the violation is beyond a reasonable doubt.

       The published Report of an Officer constitutes prima facie
       evidence of the truth of those matters reported therein which
       that Officer is required by law to report.  This presumption may
       be set aside only by clear and convincing evidence to the
       contrary.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1565/10 (Power=1)
Dismissal of a CFJ

       A Judgement of DISMISSED should be delivered if and only if one
       or more of the following is true:

         i) The CFJ does not contain a single clearly-identified
            Statement.

        ii) After a reasonable effort to obtain all relevant
            information, the Judge can neither determine the Statement
            to be true nor determine it to be false.

       iii) The Statement does not relate to a matter relevant to the
            Rules.

        iv) The CFJ lacks standing, as defined elsewhere.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1803/2 (Power=1)
Judicial and Sentencing Orders

       Judicial Orders and Sentencing Orders are executed by being sent
       to the Clerk of the Courts, but do not take effect until their
       publication by the Clerk of the Courts.  The Clerk of the Courts
       shall publish each Judicial Order and Sentencing Order as soon
       as possible after receiving it from the Judge who executed it.

       Any Player may formally request a Judge issue any Judicial Order
       by filing a motion requesting that Order.  If granted, the Judge
       shall issue the Order requested.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 1826 (Motions) to read:

       A Motion is a formal request made by a Player to the Judge of a
       CFJ.  A Motion is made by submitting it to the Clerk of the
       Courts, clearly identifying the CFJ to which the Motion applies.

       The Clerk of the Courts shall forward each properly-filed Motion
       to the Judge of the CFJ to which the Motion applies as soon as
       possible after receiving it.  A Judge must either grant or deny
       each Motion so forwarded within five days of receiving it.  A
       Judge grants or denies a Motion by sending eir determination on
       that Motion to the Clerk of the Courts, along with any reasons e
       chooses to provide.

       The effect of granting a Motion depends on its nature, but
       generally amounts to requiring the Judge to perform as requested
       by the Motion.

       Upon receipt of a Judge's determination on a Motion, the Clerk
       shall note the determination made and the reasons, if any, on
       the record of the CFJ, and shall notify the Player who made the
       Motion of that determination.

       If a Judge fails to Grant or Deny a Motion within five days of
       when it was forwarded to em by the Clerk of the Courts, the
       Clerk of the Courts shall Recuse the Judge and assign a new one
       as usual.

       If a Motion is made after a case is closed, and the original
       Judge of that case is not active or is not a player, then a new
       Judge shall be assigned to the case as usual.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1509/4 (Power=1)
Orders to Compel

       Upon a judicial finding that a Player has failed to perform a
       duty required of em by the Rules, the Judge so finding shall
       execute an Order, requiring that Player to perform that duty as
       soon as possible.  Such an Order is known as an Order to Compel.

       If the duty in question arises because the Player in question
       holds a specific Office or other position of official
       responsibility, the Order shall be directed to that Office or
       position.  If the Player holding that Office fails to perform
       the duty in question as ordered, the Judge shall Order that that
       Player be removed from Office or position.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1830/2 (Power=1)
No Compulsion of Judges

       Any Order to Compel directed to a Judge, or requiring the
       performance of a duty required of a Player because that Player
       is a Judge, is invalid, unless that Order is a valid Appellate
       Order.

       Any CFJ alleging that a Judgement is incorrect, or that a Judge
       has failed to perform a judicial duty, lacks standing.  Such a
       claim should instead be pursued via Appeal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 789 (Orders to Annotate Rules) to read:

       The Judge of any CFJ, the Statement of which alleges that a Rule
       should be interpreted in a certain way, which is judged TRUE,
       may, at eir discretion, issue an Order requiring the Rulekeepor
       to annotate the Rule in question with the Statement of that CFJ.
       Such an annotation, while it exists, shall guide application of
       that Rule.

       The Rulekeepor may remove such an annotation only if that Rule
       is repealed; if required to do so by a valid Order; or if the
       original Order to annotate is amended, stayed, or vacated.  The
       Rulekeepor may vacate an Order to annotate a Rule Without
       Objection.  Annotations to a Rule may not be modified in any way
       except as specified in this Rule.

       If a Player believes that an annotation is no longer pertinent,
       e may file, in the original CFJ from which the Order of
       Annotation arises, a Motion to Vacate the Order of Annotation.
       If such a Motion is granted, the Judge granting it shall Order
       the original Order Vacated and shall Order the Rulekeepor to
       remove the annotation in question.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 1365 (Concurring and Dissenting Opinions) to read:

       Two or more players may submit a Concurring or Dissenting
       Opinion for a given CFJ trial or appeals decision, via a single
       application to the Clerk of the Courts signed by all submittors.

       The opinion must include reference to the CFJ and the particular
       judgement or appeals decision to which it applies and be
       accompanied by reasons or arugments for the opinion.

       The Clerk of the Courts shall publish any properly submitted
       Opinion and append it to the text of the legal judgement.

Amend Rule 1564 (Initiating Appeals) to read:

       The following are subject to Appeal:

         a) The Judgement of a Trial Judge.
         b) The grant or denial of a Motion.
         c) The execution of a Judicial or Sentencing Order.
         d) A claim that a Trial Judge has failed to perform a required
            judicial duty.

       A subject is Appealed when any of the following occurs:

         i) Three Players Appeal it.
        ii) A Player Appeals a Judicial or Sentencing Order binding em.
       iii) A Player Appeals a Trial Judgement convicting em of a
            Crime.

       A single subject (e.g. a specific judgement, motion, or order)
       may only be appealed once.

       As soon as possible after an Appeal is initiated, or a Player
       becomes or ceases to be an Appellate judge, the Clerk of the
       Courts shall announce the event.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 911 (The Board of Appeals) to read:

       When an Appeal is initiated, a Board of Appeals shall be
       selected to reach a decision about the subject of the Appeal.  A
       Board of Appeals consists of three Appellate Judges.  Any Judge
       assigned according to this Rule is an Appellate Judge.

       A Board of Appeals is selected when the Clerk of the Courts
       correctly announces the identity of all Appellate Judges,
       determined as follows:

         a) The Speaker is selected, if eligible.
         b) The Clerk of the Courts is selected, if eligible.
         c) Any remaining positions are filled by selection by the
            Clerk of the Courts from all remaining eligible Players.

       A Player is ineligible for selection if any of the following is
       true:

         i) E has already been selected for that Board.
        ii) E has been dismissed from that Board.
       iii) E has been Trial Judge of the subject of the Appeal.
        iv) E is ineligible to Judge the CFJ at the time of selection.

       An Appellate Judge may appoint another eligible Player as eir
       replacement by informing the Clerk of the Courts, provided the
       Player consents.

       As soon as possible after an Appellate Judge is recused, the
       Clerk of the Courts shall randomly select an eligible Player to
       replace em.

       The last Appellate Judge selected is the Lead Judge for that
       Board.  If the Lead Judge is replaced, then the replacement
       becomes Lead Judge.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 1447 (Final Judgement upon Appeal) to read:

       For an Appelate Judge assigned to the Appeal of a Judgement, a
       Judgement is exactly one of the following: SUSTAIN, REVERSE,
       REASSIGN, or REMAND.  For the appeal of other matters, a
       Judgement is exactly one of the following: SUSTAIN or OVERTURN.
       Other Rules may modify this based on the subject of the Appeal.

       If a Judgement of TRUE or FALSE is Appealed, the Board of
       Appeals shall consider the correctness of that Judgement.  If a
       Judgement of DISMISSED is Appealed, the Board shall not consider
       the truth or falsity of the original CFJ; they shall only
       consider whether a Judgement of DISMISSED should have been
       delivered.

       If a majority of the Appellate Judges Judge SUSTAIN, then the
       subject of the Appeal is sustained.  Otherwise, it is
       overturned.  The Board of Appeals shall execute whatever
       Appelate Orders are necessary to enforce its determination.

       When a Judgement is overturned:

         a) If a majority of the Appelate Judges Judge REVERSE, then
            the CFJ shall be treated as if it were Judged normally,
            with the Judgement being that which a majority of the
            Appelate Judges agree on.

         b) If a majority of the Appelate Judges Judge REASSIGN, then
            the original Judgement is ignored, the original Judge is
            recused, and the Clerk of the Courts shall reassign the CFJ
            to a new Judge in the same fashion as it was originally
            assigned.  The new Judge cannot make the same Judgement as
            the original Judge for the same reason.

         c) If a majority of the Appelate Judges Judge REMAND, then the
            original Judgement shall be ignored, and the Clerk of the
            Courts shall reassign the CFJ to the original Judge as if
            it were being originally assigned. The Judge may not make
            the same Judgement for the same reason.

         d) If none of the above is true, then the CFJ shall be
            reassigned as described above.

       As soon as possible after all members of a Board of Appeals have
       submitted eir Judgement, the Clerk of the Courts shall announce
       that this has happened.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 1804 (Appeal of Judicial and Sentencing Orders) to read:

       As soon as possible after a Judicial Order or Sentencing Order
       is Appealed, the Clerk of the Courts shall stay it.  If the
       Appeal is sustained, then the Board of Appeals shall vacate this
       stay as soon as possible.  If the Appeal is overturned, then the
       Board of Appeals shall vacate the stayed Order as soon as
       possible.

       In the Appeal of a Judicial Order or Sentencing Order, the Board
       of Appeals shall consider whether the Order was properly and
       validly executed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule (Appellate Orders) to read:

       Appellate Orders are executed by being sent to the Clerk of the
       Courts by the Lead Judge of a Board of Appeals, but do not take
       effect until their publication by the Clerk of the Courts.  The
       Lead Judge must certify in the execution that the order is
       executed by the concurrence of the majority of the Justices
       comprising that Board of Appeals; failure to do so deprives the
       Order of effect.

       Appellate Orders are not subject to appeal.  However, upon a
       judicial finding that the required certification was falsely
       provided, the Clerk of the Courts shall vacate the Order which
       was accompanied by that false certification.

       Appellate Orders are valid only if addressed to:
         a) The Clerk of the Courts in eir Official capacity;
         b) an Order issued by the Clerk of the Courts in eir Official
            Capacity;
         c) The Judge of the CFJ which that Board of Appeals was
            convened to consider, or any Order issued by that Judge in
            that particular CFJ; or
         d) any combination of the above.
       All other Appellate Orders are presumptively invalid.

       The Clerk of the Courts shall publish each Appellate Order as
       soon as possible after receiving it from the Board of Appeal
       which executed it.

       This Rule takes precedence over all Rules pertaining to the
       validity of Appellate Orders.

======================================================================
Orders
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 1793 (Orders) to read:

       An Order is a command, executed by a player and directed to some
       entity requiring that entity to perform exactly one action, or
       to refrain from performing one or more actions.

       An Order may be directed to the holder of an official position
       in eir capacity in that official position, and if the position
       changes hands before the Order is satisfied, the duty to abide
       by the Order automatically attaches to the new holder of that
       position.

       An Order may also be directed at a prior order so as to affect
       the prior order's operation, as the Rules permit.

       All Orders executed in the manner prescribed by the Rules for
       their class are presumed valid and enforceable until proven
       otherwise by CFJ.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 1794 (Classes of Orders) to read:

       Each Order is of exactly one of the following classes.  If an
       Order could be of more than one of these classes, then it is of
       the first class that matches.

         (a) A Legislative Order is an Order executed as part of the
             effect of the adoption of a Proposal.

         (b) An Appellate Order is an Order executed by a Board of
             Appeals.

         (c) A Judicial Order is an Order executed by a Judge in the
             course of performing eir duties or privileges as Judge.

         (d) A Timing Order is an Order which may be executed by any
             person and directed at any entity.  A timing order is
             valid if and only if it orders the entity to perform, as
             soon as possible, a duty specifically required of em by
             the Rules that does not otherwise have a specified timing
             requirement, or for which the otherwise specified timing
             requirement will have been exceeded as soon as possible
             after the Order is executed.

       No other types of Orders are valid.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 1795 (Order Timing) to read:

       An Order may specify the time limit for the performance of an
       ordered action.  If a time limit is less than 72 hours after the
       Order takes effect, the time limit shall be 72 hours.  If no
       time limit is specified, time limit shall be as soon as possible
       after the Order takes effect.

       If an Order which commands the performance of an action is
       directed to an Office or other position of authority, and the
       holder of that position of authority changes after the Order
       takes effect, but before the Order is satisfied, then the
       current holder shall have as soon as possible to satisfy that
       order.

       The noncompliance of an order with this Rule does not deprive
       that order of all effect, but instead modifies the timing
       requirements of the order.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 1799 (Stay and Vacation of Orders) to read:

       The effect of staying an Order is to temporarily prevent the
       stayed Order from having any effect.

       A stay may be specified to expire after a fixed time.  If no
       specification is made in the Order to Stay, the stay shall not
       expire.

       When the stay expires or is vacated, the previously stayed order
       again has effect as if it had been originally executed at the
       moment the stay ceases to be effective.  However, if at the time
       the staying Order expires or otherwise ceases to have effect,
       the stayed Order has been vacated or is subject to another
       staying Order, it does not regain effect.

       The effect of vacating an Order is to permanently deny the
       vacated Order from having any effect.  Vacating an Order to
       Vacate reinstates the ability of the vacated Order to have
       effect, as of the moment the Order to Vacate is itself vacated.

       Any Order may always be stayed or vacated by the Player (or, in
       the case of Appellate Orders, Board of Appeal) who executed it.
       Certain classes of Orders may be stayed or vacated in other
       circumstances as well, but only as the Rules allow.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 1810 (Satisfying Orders) to read:

       An Order requiring an entity to perform an action is satisfied
       when that entity performs that action.  Other Rules may define
       other ways for Orders to be satisfied.  Except when otherwise
       specified, a single action can result in the satisfaction of at
       most one Order.  If an action would satisfy more than one Order,
       and no other specification is made, the Action satisfies the
       oldest Order which it would satisfy.

       Willfully performing contrary to valid orders, either through
       action or inaction, is a violation of this Rule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
