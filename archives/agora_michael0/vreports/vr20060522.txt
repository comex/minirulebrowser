Text of Adopted Proposals
----------------------------------------------------------------------


Proposal 4856 by Goethe, AI=1, Ordinary
Winning rearranged


Proposal:  Winning rearranged

[Cleans up the sillyness with 72 hours and "any particular moment" of
winning.  Makes repealing scoring instructions automatic on a win].

Amend Rule 2075 (Winning Hands) to read:

       The Scoring Instructions contained in cardbooks, interpreted
       collectively, may define a nonsite gambler as holding a winning
       hand.  Any Player may allege that a nonsite gambler holds a
       winning hand.  The allegation is considered true if any nonsite
       gambler holds a winning hand at the time of the allegation.

       If the allegation is true, the following events occur in order,
       immediately upon the allegation being made:

         (i) All nonsite gamblers holding winning hands are deemed to
             win the game simultaneously, and are awarded the defined
             regular Patent Title Champion, five white chips, and a
             blue chip (non-transferrable) marked with the number of
             red and white chips in the Pot.

        (ii) The pot is emptied.

       (iii) All Scoring Instructions in the Blueprints Cardbook are
             repealed.

        (iv) All Players' hands become subject to a Hand Reduction to
             the Minimum Hand Size.

       If the allegation is false, the Deckmastor shall, as soon as
       possible, discard 1 card at random from the hand of the Gambler
       who made the allegation.

       If no true allegation of a winning hand or a Skunk has been made
       in the last six months, then any Gambler may allege a Skunk,
       which, if true, triggers the effects of (iii) and (iv) above.

Proposal 4858 by Goethe, AI=1, Ordinary
Streamlined hand reductions


Proposal: Streamlined hand reductions

[Takes out requirements that draws be satisfied before reduction
announced, and also the restriction against drawing.  Also lengthens
time between reductions but allows deckmastor to deal with shortages].

Amend Rule 2083 (Hand Reductions) to read:

       The Rules may declare that a nonsite Gambler's hand is subject
       to a Hand Reduction.  A particular hand reduction must have a
       maximum hand size associated with it; if none is defined, the
       Maximum Hand Size in the Deckmastor's budget is used.

       As soon as possible after a requirement for a reduction arises,
       the Deckmastor shall:

         (i) Announce the pending hand reduction;

        (ii) Wait at least four days after the announcement;

       (iii) Discard cards at random from that Gambler's hand until eir
             hand size is equal to or less than maximum associated with
             the reduction.

        (iv) If a gambler loses no cards during a reduction, and has
             neither played nor transferred a card since the last
             reduction, the Deckmastor shall discard one card at random
             from the gambler's hand (if it has any cards).

       If a dispute on the gambler's hand size or pending draws is
       raised and not resolved prior to (iii), above, the Deckmastor
       shall not perform (iii) for that hand until the dispute is
       resolved.  If no dispute is raised prior to (iii) being
       performed, then the reduction shall stand regardless of
       subsequent disputes.  However, a Judge in such a dispute may
       Order the Deckmastor to perform further card transfers to
       resolve such disputes.

       If the Deckmastor knowingly reduces a hand incorrectly, e
       commits the Class 4 Crime of Card Thievery.

       If more than one hand reduction is pending for the same hand,
       then the Deckmastor need only perform the reduction for the
       reduction with the lowest associated maximum; this shall satisfy
       all pending reductions.

       At the beginning of each Quarter, every Player's hand becomes
       subject to a hand reduction to the maximum hand size in the
       Deckmastor's Budget plus the number of Offices (including the
       Speakership) that e holds.  If at any time there are more
       unsatisfied pending draws then cards in the Deck and Discard
       Pile put together, the Deckmastor may announce a Shortage, with
       subjects every Player's hand to such a hand reduction.


Add the following Card to the Onepower Cardbook:

     * Caption:   I Fold
       Frequency: Rare
       Elements:  Asleep[30], Costly[3]
       Exploit:   Reduce your hand size to N by discarding one or more
                  cards.  Every Player becomes subject to a Hand
                  Reduction to a maximum of N.


The Quota for I Fold is hereby set to 2.


Amend the Costly exploit in the Onepower cardbook to read:

        * Costly [ Y a nonnegative integer]: There is a fee of Y to
          play this card.

Proposal 4859 by root, AI=1, Ordinary
Chip Fix 1.1


// This version fixes cashing in chips by defining chip transfers
// and creating a mechanism for cashing in chips.  Arbitrary chip
// transfers are still not permissible due to lack of a mechanism
// for doing so.  This sentence is here to even up the paragraph.

Amend Rule 2120 (Cashing in One's Chips) to read:

       The Pot is a site.

       Cashing in one or more chips is synonymous with transferring
       them to the Pot.  A player may cash in one or more of eir chips
       by announcement.  As soon as possible after e does so, the
       Deckmastor shall deal em a card for each non-forfeited chip
       cashed in.


Amend Rule 2069 (Card Actions) by replacing the text:

           When a card is otherwise transferred from one gambler to
           another, the former gambler shall cease to hold the card and
           the latter gambler shall simultaneously come to hold the
           card.

with:

           When a card or chip is otherwise transferred from one
           gambler to another, the former gambler shall cease to hold
           it and the latter gambler shall simultaneously come to hold
           it.


Amend Rule 2123 (Fees) to read:

       A player plays a fee of X by cashing in X chips and indicating
       the fee to be paid.  These chips are forfeited.
