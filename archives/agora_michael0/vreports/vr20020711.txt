Proposal 4343 by Steve, AI=1
Eligibility Fix

Amend Rule 2025 (Transfer of Jurisdiction) to read:

    (a) A CFJ (the First Case) is transferred to the Judge of another
        CFJ (the Second Case), if all of the following are true:

        (1) the Second Judge is eligible to Judge the First Case (or is 
            ineligible solely due to the Rule "Turns for All");
        (2) the First Judge announces the transfer; and
        (3) the Second Judge consents to the transfer within a week after 
            it is announced.

    (b) When the First Case is transferred in this way:
    
        (1) the First Case is assigned to the Second Judge, and ceases
            to be assigned to the First Judge;
        (2) the First Judge becomes eligible to Judge CFJs for the
            purposes of the Rule "Turns for All"; and
        (3) the First CFJ becomes Linked to the Second CFJ, and to any
            CFJs to which the Second CFJ had been Linked. It ceases to
            be Linked to any other CFJs.

Proposal 4344 by Goethe, AI=1

         the Registrar shall Order the Treasuror to pay out

Proposal 4346 by Steve, AI=1
Fix "Overdue Debts"

Amend Rule 1599 (Overdue Debts) to read:

   (a) Provided that e has not already done so, the Executor of the
       creditor of any unsatisfied debt may demand that the debtor
       satisfy that debt, by notifying the debtor of the demand.

   (b) The debtor shall have seven days from the time of the notification
       to satisfy the debt, except that if the debtor is not active at
       the time the demand is sent, the debtor shall instead have seven
       days from the time e becomes active to satisfy the debt. Time
       during which a debt is disputed is not counted for the purposes of
       this Rule.

   (c) A debt not satisfied within the time allowed by this Rule becomes
       delinquent when that time elapses. It ceases to be delinquent when
       it is satisfied.

   (d) Any Player who is the Prime Executor of an entity with respect to
       the satisfaction of a debt owed by that entity commits the Class
       1 Infraction of Persistent Indebtedness when that debt first
       becomes delinquent, and commits it again every seven days
       thereafter for as long as the debt remains delinquent. This
       Infraction may be reported by the creditor of the delinquent
       debt.
