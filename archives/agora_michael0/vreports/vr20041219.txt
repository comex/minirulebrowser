Text of Adopted Proposals
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 4628 by Murphy, AI=1, Ordinary
Drinks on the House


(I nominated myself with the intent of offering OscarMeyr a
competition bonus - which doesn't even exist any more - then
failed to either vote for em or stand down)
(I play a Distrib-u-Matic card to make this distributable)

Upon the adoption of this proposal, all Blots gained due to
Apathy in the Herald election that ended on or about November
21, 2004, are expunged.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Proposal 4629 by Murphy, AI=1, Ordinary
Quorum for Referenda and Elections


(Why is it higher than for democratic proposals?)
(I make this distributable for a fee of 1 kudo)

Amend Rule 1434 (Default Procedure for Referendum Voting) by
replacing "Quorum is 50% of the eligible Voters" with "Quorum
is one third of the eligible Voters".


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Proposal 4630 by Goethe, AI=1, Ordinary
Crashing the Party


"Well, you'll get it. You'll see. The party isn't on yet..."
-Eris

Create the following rule, entitled "Discord":

   The following card is defined:

     Caption: Chaos Apple
     Quota:   1
     Elements: Handed[5], Delayed[7], Kallisti!
     Exploit: If this card has not been Played in the current
     quarter, then, as soon as possible after this card is played,
     the Deckmaster shall simultaneously transfer all cards from
     non-Deck hands to a temporary Gambler known as Fate.  E shall
     then deal cards at random from Fate to each Gambler until
     each Gambler has the same number of cards as e had immediately
     before Fate took a hand.  If, between the time this card is
     Played and the time Fate's cards are dealt, exactly a single
     Player publicly claims to be The Prettiest One, the Deckmastor
     shall transfer this card to em as soon as possible after Fate's
     cards are dealt.  The Deckmastor is encouraged use Heisenberg's
     Law in dealing hands from Fate.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Proposal 4631 by root, AI=2, Democratic
Powered Cards 0.2


Amend Rule 2070 by adding the text:

    * Powered [X], where X is a positive integer:  This Card has a
      Power of X.  To Activate any Exploit possessed by this Card, a
      Fee of X - 1 must be paid in addition to any other Fees required
      to Activate that Exploit, unless that Exploit explicitly
      specifies otherwise.

Amend Rule 2067 by replacing the text:

     * Caption: Debate-o-Matic
       Elements: Budgeted
       Exploit: Change the Chamber of any one non-Sane Proposal to
         the Chamber of your choice, provided it is legal for that
         Proposal to be in the named Chamber.

with:

     * Caption: Debate-o-Matic
       Elements: Budgeted, Powered [2]
       Exploit: Change the Chamber of any one non-Sane Proposal to
         the Chamber of your choice, provided it is legal for that
         Proposal to be in the named Chamber.

Change the Power of Rule 2067 to 2 if it is not already 2.
