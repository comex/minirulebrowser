Proposal 4360 by Steve, AI=1
Forgiveness Tweak

Amend Rule 2010 (Oligarchy Upkeep) by changing the text in which
curerently reads:

      (b) If an Oligarch does not pay eir Oligarchy Upkeep within a
          week of the GWotO's announcement of the debt, then the GWotO
          shall forgive the Upkeep debt, and remove the Oligarch from

to read:

      (b) If an Oligarch does not pay eir Oligarchy Upkeep within a

          shall remove the Oligarch from the Oligarchy, and Order the
          Bank to forgive the Upkeep debt.

only the Treasuror is empowered to forgive.]
