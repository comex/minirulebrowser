Text of Adopted Proposals
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 4832 by Maud, AI=3, Democratic
Condense ratification


Change the title of rule 1551 (Documents Subject to Ratification) to
"Ratification", increase its power to 3, and amend it to read:

      A document required to be maintained and published by a player
      can be ratified if and only if:

      (a) the correctness of the document is not under dispute;

      (b) the information within the document has not been superseded
          by a subsequent document which contradicts it and whose
          correctness is not under dispute; and

      (c) the document is not the ruleset.

      If a player attempts to ratify a document, or a legislative
      order executed by the adoption of a proposal would ratify a
      document, then that document is not ratified unless it can be
      ratified.

      The electee to an office is permitted to ratify, without
      objection, an official report e produced and was required to
      maintain by virtue of holding that office.  The Speaker is
      permitted to ratify, without objection, any official report.  In
      either case, a claim of error on such a report shall be deemed
      to constitute an objection to ratification.

      When a document is ratified, the gamestate is modified so that
      the ratified document was completely true and accurate at the
      time it was published.  Nevertheless, the ratification of a
      document does not invalidate, reverse, alter, or cancel any
      messages or actions, even if they were unrecorded or overlooked,
      or change the legality of any attempted action.

      After a document has been ratified, its maintainer shall
      annotate all subsequent publications of that document with the
      date of publication of the most recent issue of that published
      that was ratified.

Repeal rule 1791 (Ratificiation Without Objection).
Repeal rule 1552 (Requirements for Ratification).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 4833 by Maud, AI=3, Democratic
Tension makes a tangle


Change the title of rule 101 (Obey the Rules) to "Agora May I?",
and amend it to read:

      Any player is permitted to perform an action which is not
      regulated.  An action is regulated if:

      (a) the action is prohibited;

      (b) the rules indicate that if certain conditions are satisfied,
          then some player is permitted to perform the action;

      (c) the action would, as part of its effect, modify information
          for which some player is required to be a recordkeepor;

      (d) the action would, as part of its effect, make it impossible
          to make arbitrary modifications to the rules by any
          combinations of actions by players; or

      (e) the courts have held that the action is regulated, and this
          finding has not been overturned.

      A player besides the Speaker is always permitted to deregister
      rather than continue to play.  Please treat Agora right good
      forever.

Repeal rule 1011 (Definition of Nomic Property).

[Shouldn't this be "Can't implies needn't"?]

Amend rule 2039 (Ought implies can) to read:

      No player may be required to do anything e is not empowered to
      do, and the failure of a player to do something e was not
      empowered to do shall never constitute the commission of a crime
      or infraction.

[Should I define "note"?  Use a different word?]

Change the title of rule 1527 (Timing of Multiple Events in One
Message) to "Unsnarling Tangles", and amend it to read:

      Whenever a message contains more than one note on which the
      rules place some legal significance, the notes shall be taken to
      have been sent sequentially in the order they appear in the
      message.

      A tangle is any set of two or more notes in a message, none of
      which can be determined to appear in the message before the
      others.  If a message containing a tangle does not provide an
      order for the notes in that tangle, then the notes in that
      tangle shall be considered ambiguous and without effect if the
      effects of those notes on the gamestate would depend on the
      order in which they take effect, discounting the mere fact of
      their taking effect in a different order.

Change the title of rule 869 (How to Join Agora) to "How to Join and
Leave Agora", and amend it to read:

      A person who is not currently registered as a player and is not
      prohibited from registering is permitted to register.

      A person registers or deregisters by announcement.

      Whenever a person registers, e becomes a player.

      Whenever a player deregisters or is deregistered, e ceases to be
      a player and is prohibited from registering for the next thirty
      days.

Repeal rule 1043 (Deregistration).

Amend rule 478 (Fora) to read:

      Publicity is a stuck forum switch with values null, Discussion,
      and Public.  A forum's publicity may not be changed except as
      described in this rule.

      The Registrar may flip the publicity of a forum without
      objection as long as:

      (a) e sends eir announcement of intent to that forum; and

      (b) if the forum is to be made public, the announcement by which
          the Registrar makes that forum public is sent to all
          existing public fora.

      Each active player should ensure e can receive messages via each
      public forum.

      The Registrar's report shall include a list of all public or
      discussion fora and sufficient data regarding each to allow
      players to receive messages via that medium.  The Registrar need
      not keep track of null fora.

      A message is public if and only if it is sent via a public forum
      or is sent to all players and contains a clear designation of
      intent to be public.  A player "publishes" or "announces"
      something by sending a public message.

      A player performs an action "by announcement" by announcing that
      e performs it.  A player performs an action "by private message"
      to some player by sending an appropriate private message to the
      specified player.  Any action performed by sending a message is
      performed at the time date-stamped on that message.

Section 1.  Rules changes.

Amend rule 2068 (The Deckmastor) to read:

      The Deckmastor is an office; its holder is responsible for fair
      play, shuffling, and dealing, and is the recordkeepor for cards.

      The Deckmastor's weekly report shall contain a record of all
      cards in existence, recent card actions, and what entity holds
      each card.  The Deckmastor need not record or report transfers
      of cards to the table.

Amend rule 2114 (Card Definitions) to read:

      A document is a cardbook if so designated by the rules.  The
      Deckmastor is the recordkeepor of cardbooks; eir monthly report
      shall include each cardbook.  As soon as possible after a
      cardbook changes, the Deckmastor shall publish that cardbook.  A
      cardbook may only be changed as explicitly permitted by the
      rules.

      The Deckmastor may change non-substantial properties of any
      cardbook, specifically layout, whitespace, and the order of
      definitions, as e sees fit.

      A cardbook can define a class of cards by specifying its
      Caption, Frequency, zero or one Exploits, and optionally its
      Elements, and can define an Element by specifying its name and
      description.  Neither classes of cards nor Elements may be
      otherwise defined.

      (a) The Caption is a string of text, unique to a particular
          class of cards.

      (b) The Frequency of a card is exactly one of the values Unique,
          Rare, or Common, defaulting to Unique if unspecified or
          incorrectly specified.

      (c) A card with a particular Element behaves according to the
          description of that Element.

      (d) An Exploit of a card may contain one or more Indications,
          Impositions, and Feats.

          (1) An Indication is a requirement for the gambler playing
              the card to select some entity or value.

          (2) An Imposition is a requirement the gambler may impose
              upon another gambler by playing the card.

          (3) A Feat is an action the gambler may perform by playing
              the card.

          (4) A Fuse is an Imposition or Feat that is not imposed or
              performed immediately, but rather when a stated
              condition occurs.

      A reference to "you" or "your" in any text on a card refers to
      the gambler holding the card unless it is on the table, and then
      refers to the gambler who played the card.

      The cards of a given class are fungible.  Each individual
      instance of a card shall be considered to be a copy of that
      class of card.

      If there are conflicts between a card or element definition in a
      cardbook and the rules, then the conflict shall be resolved as
      if the definition were contained in the text of the rule that
      defines the particular cardbook.  This rule takes precedence
      over any rule that would require a different method of resolving
      such conflicts.

      This rule takes precedence over any rule describing the
      definition or interpretation of card classes and card elements.

Amend rule 2069 (Card Actions) to read:

      (a) A nonperson entity is a site if so designated by the rules
          or a cardbook.  A site may have one or more Elements.

      (b) A gambler is a player or a site.  All gamblers may hold
          cards.  If a card is held by a nongambler, the Deckmastor
          shall transfer that card to the Deck as soon as possible.

          A gambler's hand is the collection of cards held by that
          gambler.  A gambler's hand size is the size of this
          collection, plus one for each pending draw for that gambler.

      (c) When a card must be created or destroyed, the Deckmastor
          shall be empowered to create or destroy that card, as
          appropriate, and must do so as soon as possible.  The
          Deckmastor creates or destroys a card by announcement,
          specifying as appropriate its holder or its former holder.
          Cards can be neither created nor destroyed otherwise.

          Whenever the quota for a class of cards exceeds the number
          of existing copies of that card, a copy of that card must be
          created.  The copy must be created in the deck's hand unless
          otherwise specified.

          Whenever the number of existing copies of a card exceeds the
          quota for its class, if the deck holds a copy of that card,
          a copy held by the deck must be destroyed, and if the deck
          does not, then a random copy of the card must be destroyed.

      (d) If a card would be transferred to the deck or the table, and
          the transfer is not performed automatically, as part of the
          Deckmastor's duties, or as the result of a card play, it is
          discarded instead.

          When a card is otherwise transferred from one gambler to
          another, the former gambler shall cease to hold the card and
          the latter gambler shall simultaneously come to hold the
          card.

          Discarding a card is synonymous with transferring it to the
          discard pile.  Dealing a card to a gambler is synonymous
          with selecting a random card from the deck and transferring
          it from the deck to that gambler.

          A gambler may transfer a card e holds to another gambler by
          announcement, specifying the card to transfer and, if not
          discarding it, the gambler to receive the card.

      (e) A nonsite gambler whose hand size is smaller than the
          maximum hand size, plus the number of offices e holds, may
          draw a card for a fee equal to the number of times during
          the current month e has previously drawn a card in this
          manner.

      (f) When a gambler draws a card, e gains a pending draw.  As
          soon as possible afterward, the Deckmastor shall deal a card
          to that gambler.  When e does so, the draw is no longer
          pending.

          If the Deckmastor errs, in good faith, in selecting a
          particular card to deal, and that error does not greatly
          change the probability of selecting that card, that deal
          shall be allowed to stand.

          As soon as possible after a player correctly announces that
          the sum of the number of pending draws for each gambler is
          greater than the number of cards in the deck, or that there
          are no cards in the deck, then the Deckmastor shall
          reshuffle the deck.  Whenever the deck is reshuffled, all
          cards in the discard pile are automatically transferred to
          the deck.

Change the title of rule 2106 (Card Fees) to "Playing Cards", and
amend it to read:

      A gambler plays a card with an Exploit by announcement,
      specifying the card to be played, indicating any entities or
      values mentioned in an Indication of the card's Exploit, and
      noting any fees required to play the card.  A card without an
      Exploit cannot be played.

      When a gambler plays a card, the following events automatically
      occur in order:

      (a) The card is transferred to the table.

      (b) One at a time in the order listed on the card, the gambler
          places any Impositions listed in the Exploit on the
          appropriate gamblers and performs each Feat listed in the
          Exploit.

      (c) If the card is still on the table, it is discarded.

      If the card has any Fuses, then the first time the stated
      condition for a Fuse occurs, the gambler places the Imposition
      or performs the Feat associated with that Fuse as appropriate.

      The Elements or Exploit of a card may modify any of the above
      events.

Amend rule 2080 (Cards for Proposals) to read:

      Within a week after a proposal's adoption, if its proposer would
      be permitted to draw a card for a fee, then e may draw a card by
      announcement, specifying in eir announcement that proposal's
      number.  E can only perform this action once for the adoption of
      that proposal.

Amend rule 2091 (The Office of Secretary of the University) to read:

      The Secretary of the University (SotU) is an office; its holder
      is recordkeepor for the University.

      The SotU's Weekly Report shall include:

      (a) A list of all active Research Grants.

      (b) A list of all active Book Club Selections.

      (c) Each player's Education.

      (d) A list of who has checked out cards from the library.

Amend rule 2086 (The University of Agora) to read:

      The University, also known as the Library, is a site.  The
      Speaker is the president of and a limited executor of the
      University.

      Education is a stuck player switch with values Student and
      Faculty Member.  The Secretary of the University (SotU) is the
      recordkeepor of education.  As soon as possible after a player
      is awarded a degree, the SotU shall flip the education of that
      player to Faculty Member.

Amend rule 2089 (Gardner Library) to read:

      Whenever the Library's hand size is less than five, it gains a
      pending draw.

      A player (hereafter the Borrower) may check out a specified card
      from the Library by paying a Fee for the Library's upkeep.  The
      fee is 2 Kudos for Students and 1 Kudo for Faculty Members.  The
      card is reserved and may not be checked out by any player until
      it is dealt to the Library again by the Deckmastor.

      Whenever a card is checked out from the Library, it is
      transferred to the Borrower.

      The President of the University may discard any card in the
      possession of the Library without two objections.
