Proposal 4423 by Murphy, AI=1, Democratic
Sensible Timing for Auctions

Proposal: Sensible Timing for Indulgence Auctions

Amend Rule 1712 (Distribution of Indulgences) to read:

      (a) The Ideal Indulgence Circulation Level (IICL) is equal to
          the number of Players plus the total Stain of all Players.

      (b) The Actual Indulgence Circulation Level (AICL) is the total
          number of Indulgences owned by entities other than the Bank,
          augmented by the total number of Indulgences owned by the
          Bank which either:

          (1) are already being Auctioned by the Bank in prior
              Indulgence Auctions that have not yet concluded; or
          (2) have been auctioned in prior Indulgence Auctions that
              have concluded, but where the debts arising from Winning
              Bids have neither been paid nor defaulted upon; or
          (3) have been Auctioned in prior Indulgence Auctions that
              have concluded, and the debts arising from the Winning
              Bids have been paid, but the Indulgences have not been
              transferred to the Winning Bidders.

      (c) The Indulgence Surplus is the difference between the IICL
          and the AICL; if the AICL is greater than the IICL, the
          Indulgence Surplus is zero.

      (d) If the Indulgence Surplus is positive at the beginning of
          the month, the Herald shall as soon as possible auction off
          the surplus Indulgences. The items to be auctioned are
          individual Indulgences; the number of items is equal to the
          Indulgence Surplus, rounded down to the nearest integer.
          The Auctioneer shall be the Herald, and the Auction shall be
          conducted in Stems.

      (e) The Monthly Bank Indulgence Gain (MBIG) is the number of
          Indulgences transferred from other entities to the Bank
          during a given Nomic Month, less the number of Indulgences
          transferred from the Bank to other entities during that same
          Nomic Month.

      (f) If the Indulgence Surplus is zero or negative at the
          beginning of the month, the Herald may still conduct an
          Indulgence auction, but only if e initiates it within one
          week after the beginning of the month. The items to be
          auctioned are individual Indulgences; the number of items is
          chosen by the Herald, with a minimum of 1 and a maximum of
          half the MBIG, rounded down to the nearest integer. The
          Auctioneer shall be the Herald, and the Auction shall be
          conducted in Stems.

Proposal 4424 by Steve, AI=1, Democratic
Protect the inactive

Proposal
Protect the inactive

When this Proposal takes effect, any inactive players who became quiet
within the previous month become noisy.

Amend Rule 1042 (Deregistration Due to Silence) by replacing the text
in it which currently reads:

      (b) A player who has not quietened another player in the past 24
          hours may do so by publically identifying the player and
          stating that e causes that player to become quiet.

with text which reads:

      (b) A player who has not quietened another active, noisy player
          in the past 24 hours may cause another active, noisy player
          to become quiet by publically identifying the player and
          stating that e causes that player to become quiet.

[Comment: it strikes me as odd that we have these very strong
protections against requiring inactive players to do anything, and
then we make a solitary exception in the case of selecting Judges,
which exception we never invoke anyway. I think it would be more
consistent and elegant simply not to require inactive players to be
judges, and this is what I propose here.]

Amend Rule 698 (Always an Eligible Judge) to read:

      (a) Each active player is eligible to judge a given CFJ, unless
          a rule specifically makes em ineligible. Inactive players
          are ineligible to judge CFJs.

      (b) If the Clerk of the Courts is required to select a Judge,
          but after taking all other rules affecting eligibility into
          account, no player is eligible to judge that CFJ, then:
          (1) All active non-barred players become eligible to judge
              that CFJ.
          (2) If there is still no player eligible to judge, then all
              active barred players, other than the caller emself,
              become eligible to judge that CFJ.
          (3) If there is still no eligible Judge, then the game is in
              serious trouble. My usual advice in such situations is
              to panic, and run screaming for the hills.

      (c) This Rule takes precedence over other Rules concerning who
          is and is not eligible to judge CFJs.
