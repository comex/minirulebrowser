Proposal 4570 by Elysion, AI=2, Democratic
Filibustering Take Two


Amend rule 1933/5 (A Proposal's Chamber) to read:

      Chamber is a stuck switch for Proposals with values Ordinary and
      Democratic.

      An Ordinary Proposal with Adoption Index of two (2) or greater is
a
      Stalled Proposal. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, a Stalled
      Proposal may not be distributed. If a proposal is distributed that
      was Stalled at the time of distribution, the Promotor shall abort
it
      as soon as possible.

      Every Proposal is initially Democratic, unless its Adoption Index
      is less than two (2), in which case it is initially Ordinary.  The
      Chamber of a Proposal may only be changed as specified by an
      instrument with Power greater than or equal to two (2).
