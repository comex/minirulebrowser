This Proposal has an Adoption Index of 2.

Amend Rule 1963 to read:

          possible.  The GWoTO removes a Player from the Oligarchy by
          correctly announcing that at least one of the above
          conditions is true for that Player. The named Player
          ceases to be an Oligarch as of the GWoTO's announcement.

          Oligarch.

Proposal #4263 by Steve, AI=3
Fix Rule 955

This Proposal has an Adoption Index of 3.

Amend Rule 955 (Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal) to read:

      (a) When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the
	  uncancelled votes which have been legally cast shall be
	  counted by the Assessor. The Proposal shall then be assigned a
	  Voting Index, as follows: if the Proposal received no votes
	  against, and at least one vote for, the Voting Index shall be
	  Unanimity; if there are no votes for, the Voting Index shall
	  be zero; in all other cases, the Voting Index shall be the
	  number of votes for divided by the number of votes against.

      (b) If the Voting Index is greater than the Adoption Index for the
	  Proposal (or if both equal Unanimity), and if Quorum for the
	  Proposal is achieved, then that Proposal is adopted.
	  Otherwise, it fails.

      (c) A Proposal may not have its Voting Index set except as
	  described in this Rule.  A Proposal cannot be adopted
	  except as described in this Rule.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal #4264 by Steve, AI=2
Contested Proposals

This Proposal has an Adoption Index of 2.

Create a Power = 2 Rule entitled "Contested Proposals" with the
following text:

      (a) A null Proposal is a Proposal containing no provisions, i.e.,
	  one that does not propose any Rule Changes, or any other
	  changes to the game state.

      (b) Any Player may make a null Proposal Distributable without
	  payment of the usual Fee, provided that no other null Proposal
	  in the current Nomic Month has been made Distributable under
	  this provision.

      (c) The first null Proposal to be distributed in each Nomic Month
	  is a Contested Proposal.

      (d) A Contested Proposal is Democratic.

      (e) Notwithstanding the prevailing Mode of Voting on Proposals,
	  voting on a Contested Proposal is always Unrestricted. This
	  Rule takes precedence over Rules that determine the
	  permissible methods for casting votes on Proposals.

      (f) If a Contested Proposal fails Quorum, no Points are Awarded.

      (g) If a Contested Proposal achieves Quorum, but fails, each
	  Player who voted against the Proposal and did not vote for it
	  may be Awarded 10 Points.

      (h) If a Contested Proposal is adopted, each Player who voted for
	  the Proposal and did not vote against it may be Awarded 10
	  Points.
