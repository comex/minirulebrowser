Text of Adopted Proposals
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 4799 by root, AI=1, Democratic
Not Your Turn No More


Upon adoption of this proposal, each Gambler other than the Deck gains
one pending draw for each copy of "Not Your Turn" in eir hand.

Upon adoption of this proposal, the Deckmastor's budget is amended by
deleting the quota for "Not Your Turn".

Amend Rule 2076 by deleting the text that reads:

      Caption:  Not Your Turn
      Elements: Budgeted, Delayed[2]
      Exploit:  You may specify a card play that has occurred
                in the past 48 hours, and (1) that card shall be
                deemed to have not been played, and (2) the gambler
                who originally played that card may not play a copy
                of that card for the next 72 hours.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 4800 by Quazie, AI=1, Democratic
option 2.1


Goethe is a co-author on this proposal

Amend Rule 2076 by replacing the text that reads:

     Caption:  Not Your Turn
     Elements: Budgeted, Delayed[2]
     Exploit:  You may specify a card play that has occurred
               in the past 48 hours, and (1) that card shall be
               deemed to have not been played, and (2) the gambler
               who originally played that card may not play a copy
               of that card for the next 72 hours.

               deemed to have not been played, and (2) the gambler
               who originally played that card may not play a copy
               of that card for the next 72 hours.  If playing this
               card directly leads to a condition which would
               retroactively nullify its own play, the play is
               ineffective.

Proposal 4801 by Sherlock, AI=1, Democratic
The Envoy


Create an Agoran Contract entitled "The Envoy" with the regulations:
 
      This is an Agoran Contract between Agora and the Speaker.
       
      The person who is most responsible for advertising Agora and
      soliciting new Players, in the opinion of the Speaker, shall be
      known as the Envoy.  Any changes in the identity of the Envoy
      shall take effect when announced publicly by the Speaker.

      The Envoy shall advertise Agora on a regular basis in any
      non-Agoran public forums e deems appropriate.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 4802 by Maud, AI=2, Democratic
How to Join Agora


Repeal rule 2094 (Corporate Players).

Change the title of rule 869 (Registered Players) to "How to Join
Agora", and amend it to read:

      A person who is not currently registered as a player and is not
      prohibited from registering may become a registered player by
      sending a message to a public forum which sets forth eir intent
      to register.

Amend rule 1677 (Honoring the New) to read:

      Readiness is a stuck player switch with values unready and
      ready.  A player may flip eir readiness to ready.

      Whenever a player registers who has not been registered within
      the previous year, e becomes unready and is subject to a Grace
      Period beginning immediately and lasting for sixty days, not
      including Holidays.  At the end of eir Grace Period, e becomes
      ready.

      As soon as possible after the beginning of a player's Grace
      Period, the Registrar shall announce eir arrival.  This
      announcement shall have the effect of setting that player's
      kudos to twice the Tabla Rasa.

      If a player joins the game, but is neither subject to a Grace
      Period nor has been a player at any time since the last Turning
      of a New Parchment, then the Herald shall set eir kudos to half
      the Tabla Rasa (rounded up).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 4804 by Maud, AI=2, Democratic
The Taupe Repairs


Amend rule 1658 (Tainting the Speaker) to read:

      The person holding the position of Speaker is untainted as long
      as e holds that position lawfully.

Amend rule 1963 (Eligible Shareholders) to read:

      A player is an eligible shareholder unless e is not active, has
      three or more blots, or is the Speaker.

It is axiomatic that any position can be made to appear absurd by
taking it to extremes.
