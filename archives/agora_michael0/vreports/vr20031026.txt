Proposal 4531 by root, AI=1, Ordinary, Disinterested
Nameless Proposal


Comment: Money grubbing contests are obsolete.  There no longer are any,
          and without Stems they serve no purpose.  I propose we do away
          with them (unless somebody has a better idea).

Repeal Rule 2031 (Money Grubbing Contests).

Proposal 4532 by OscarMeyr, AI=2, Democratic
Clean Up Oligarchy Removal


Create a new rule:
Title: Removing Oligarchs From the Oligarchy
Power = 2

       When the Rules direct the GWotO to remove a Player from the
       Oligarchy, the GWotO shall publicly announce:

       (i) the Oligarch to be removed;
       (ii) the reason for the removal; and
       (iii) the Rule that authorizes that reason.

       If this notice is correct, the named Player ceases to be an
       Oligarch as of the GWotO's announcement.

       The GWotO's announcement is to be made as soon as possible
       after the governing event happens, unless the governing Rule
       specifies a different time period.

Amend R1936 by replacing:

       (b) If an Oligarch becomes ineligible to be an Oligarch, the
           GWotO shall remove that Player from the Oligarchy as soon as
           possible.  The GWotO removes a Player from the Oligarchy by
           correctly announcing that at least one of the above
           conditions is true for that Player.  The named Player ceases
           to be an Oligarch as of the GWoTO's announcement.

With:

       (b) If an Oligarch becomes ineligible to be an Oligarch, the
           GWotO shall remove that Player from the Oligarchy.


Amend R1963 by replacing:

       (b) By default, a Player remains an Oligarch for a period of
           time equal to the Oligarchic Term.  The Grand Warden of the
           Oligarchy shall remove a Player from the Oligarchy by public
           announcement, as soon as possible after eir term expires.
           Other rules may cause Players to cease to be Oligarchs.

with:

       (b) When a Player's Term of Service expires, the Grand Warden of
           the Oligarchy shall remove that Player from the Oligarchy.

          The Notary is an office; its holder is responsible for
          maintaining a record of organizations and their jurisdictions.

          The Notary's weekly report shall include the following
          information for each organization:

            a) Its name.
            b) Its administrator.
            c) Its executor.
            d) The maintainer of its charter.
            e) A list of players within its jurisdiction.

          organization, the Notary shall announce that fact.  If an
          organization is created, the Notary shall announce the above
          information for that organization.

Amend Rule 1539 (Regulations and Membership of Contests) to read:

          The regulations of a contest may specify the following:

            a) How a contestmaster is replaced.  No person may become
               contestmaster without eir consent.  If left unspecified,
               the contestmaster cannot change while the contest exists.

            b) Restrictions on players to become contestants.

            c) Conditions under which contestants cease to be contestants.

          No player is bound to obey any regulation or combination of
          regulations that conflict with the Rules.

          A player becomes a contestant, or ceases to be a contestant, by
          notifying the contestmaster.

          A contestmaster may publicly resign at any time, at which time
          e ceases to be contestmaster.

Amend Rule 1742 (Agreements between Players) to read:

          Players may make agreements among themselves with the intention
          that such agreements will be binding under the rules.  If such
          an agreement is subsequently broken, any player party to that
          agreement may then call a CFJ alleging that the agreement has
          been broken.  If the judge of such a CFJ finds that the
          agreement was entered into with the intention that the
          agreement be binding under the rules, and that the agreement has
          in fact been broken, then e may order the breaching party to
          perform according to the agreement, or perform substitute acts
          that would fairly serve the interests of the agreement; e may
          further order the other parties of the agreement to perform
          such acts as may be necessary to preserve fairness and justice.

          Nothing in this rule shall be construed so as to impair the
          enforcement of an agreement which requires a Player to violate
          another agreement.

          If a CFJ alleging that an agreement has been broken is called by
          anyone who is not party to that agreement, then it lacks standing
          and shall be dismissed.

Amend Rule 1794 (Classes of Orders) by replacing this text:

            (f) An Administrative Order is an Order executed by an
                Officer in the course of performing the duties or
                privileges of that Office.  For the purpose of this
                Rule, the following positions are deemed to be Offices:

                   (i) The Speaker.
                  (ii) The Recordkeepor of a Currency.

with this text:

            (f) An Administrative Order is an Order executed by an
                Officer in the course of performing the duties or
                privileges of that Office.  For the purpose of this
                Rule, the Speaker is deemed to be an Office.
