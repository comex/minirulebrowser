Text of Adopted Proposals
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 4547 by Sherlock, AI=1, Ordinary
Liven Up Team Names


[ This change would allow the Scorekeepor to rename Teams after a Win. ]

Alter Rule 2042, "Team Wins", to read:

      A Team achieves a Team Win when its Team Score reaches reaches
      the Team Points Goal, as set in the Scorekeepor's Budget.

      The Scorekeepor shall make a public announcement of the Team Win
      as soon as possible after the Team Win is achieved.  In the
      announcement the Scorekeepor shall award the Boon of Teamwork to
      each Player in the winning Team.

      Later in the same announcement the Scorekeepor shall reassign
      the grouping of Players into Teams as follows;

      1) The Player with the highest Score in the Team with the
         highest Team Score is assigned to the Team with the lowest
         Team Score.

      2) The Player who has the lowest Score in the Team with the
         lowest Team Score is assigned as to distribute the players as
         evenly as possible among the Teams.

      3) All other Players remain assigned to the same Teams.

      If in any of the above there is a choice of more than one Player
      or Team, the Scorekeepor shall choose between the applicable
      Players or Teams as e sees fit. The Scorekeepor shall include
      the details of the reassignments in eir announcement.

      The Scorekeepor may rename any Team in this announcement, if e
      chooses to do so.  That Team shall be known by its new name
      henceforth.

      Upon the Scorekeepor's announcement, all Players' Scores and all
      Teams' Scores are set to zero.

Proposal 4548 by Magu, AI=1, Democratic, Positive Advertising
Legality of Santa Clauses


Add the following text to the end of Rule 1870:

      There exists a Boon known as Shiny New Toy, and an Albatross known
      as Lump of Coal.  For the purposes of this rule, Players with a
      Stain of at least one Blot are known as Naughty, and Players with
a
      Stain of less than one Blot are known as Nice.

      As soon as possible after the conclusion of the Holiday described
      above, the Herald shall award a Shiny New Toy to each Nice Player,
      and a Lump of Coal to each Naughty player.
