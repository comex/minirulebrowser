Proposal 4410 by Steve, AI=2, Democratic, Sane
Quorum on Parliamentary Proposals

This Proposal has an Adoption Index of 2.

[Comment: I pointed out a while ago that the way Quorum is currently
defined for parliamentary proposals makes it highly unlikely that they
will pass. What is proposed here is to let Quorum be determined just as
it is for democratic proposals. Note also the proposed simplification of
the definition of Quorum on Democratic Proposals.]

Amend Rule 2020 (Parliamentary Votes) to read:

  (a) The First Estate consists of all Players who are Acolytes, the
      Second Estate of all Players who are Politicians, and the Third
      Estate of all Players who are Scribes.

  (b) To count the votes on a parliamentary proposal, the Assessor shall
      first count as preliminary votes all communications from Players
      and their Executors that would have been legal votes on the
      proposal if it had been sane.

  (c) For each Estate, the Assessor shall then use the preliminary votes
      of the Players in that Estate to determine a voting index for the
      Estate on the Proposal. If the voting index is greater than or
      equal to the adoption index of the proposal, then the Estate is
      deemed to have cast 1 vote FOR the proposal; otherwise, the Estate
      is deemed to have cast one vote AGAINST the proposal. The Estates
      are deemed to have cast their votes a moment before the end of the
      voting period.

  (d) Quorum for parliamentary proposals is determined using preliminary
      votes, and is calculated as it would be for a democratic proposal.

  (e) Votes cannot be cast on parliamentary proposals except as described
      in this Rule.


Amend Rule 879 (Quorum) to read:

  (a) An ordinary proposal achieves quorum if at least three oligarchs
      cast votes on it, and the Speaker did not veto it.

  (b) A democratic proposal achieves quorum if at least one third of all
      active noisy players cast votes on it.

  (c) Quorum for a democratic proposal shall be determined from the
      number of active noisy players at the time that the proposal was
      distributed, or at the time it was made a democratic proposal,
      whichever is later.

[Comment: simplifies the definition of quorum on democratic proposals,
and deletes the definition of quorum on parliamentary proposals, since a
new definition is given in R2020.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 4412 by Steve, AI=3, Democratic, Sane
Real Majorities

Amend Rule 955 (Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal) by replacing the
text in it which currently reads:

      (b) If the Voting Index is greater than or equal to the Adoption
          Index for the Proposal, and if Quorum for the Proposal is
          achieved, then that Proposal is adopted.  Otherwise, it
          fails.

with text which reads:

      (b) If the Voting Index is greater than one, and greater than or
          equal to the Adoption Index for the Proposal, and if Quorum
          for the Proposal is achieved, then that Proposal is adopted.
          Otherwise, it fails.
