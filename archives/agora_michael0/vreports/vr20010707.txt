Proposal 4177 by Elysion, AI=1
Raffle Patch

[
Rule 1954/3 (Distribution of Papyri), Rule 1712/10 (Distribution of
Indulgences), Rule 1936/6 (Auctioning Positions in the Oligarchy), and Rule
1946/3 (Distribution of Voting Entitlements) all provide restrictions on
_bidding_. However, a Raffle does not involve bidding; this proposal would
fix the Raffle rule so players are properly disqualified. To the best of my
knowledge, this proposal does not conflict with proposal #01-108 ("Auction
Patches").
]

Amend rule 1984 (Raffles) by replacing the text reading:

      (b) Entrants: Every Player not on Hold may enter the Raffle. On
          Hold status is measured at the time a Player enters the
          Raffle.

with:

          Hold status is measured at the time a Player enters the
          Raffle. However, if a rule prohibits a player from bidding
          in this Auction, then e is also prohibited from buying
          tickets.
