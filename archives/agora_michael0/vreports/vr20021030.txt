----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 4406 by Murphy, AI=3, Democratic
Criminal Reform (v1.3)

Amend Rule 1023 (Definition of "As Soon As Possible") to read:

      A requirement to perform an action "as soon as possible" is a
      requirement to perform the action within a week.

      If a Player fails to observe such a requirement, and no other
      Rule defines a penalty for the failure, then the Player commits
      the Class 1 Infraction of Tardiness, which may be reported by
      any Player.

      This Rule does not prevent late actions from taking effect, but
      merely penalizes the Player for being late.

      Other Rules may grant extensions of the penalty-free period to
      non-active Players without conflicting with this Rule.

Amend Rule 1553 (Officer Transition) by removing the text "violates this
Rule, and".

Amend Rule 1724 (Urgent Proposals) by replacing the text "may be
detected and reported" with "may be reported".

Amend Rule 1794 (Classes of Orders) to read:

      Each Order is of exactly one of the following classes.  If an
      Order could be of more than one of these classes, then it is
      of the first class that matches.

        (a) A Legislative Order is an Order executed as part of the
            effect of the adoption of a Proposal.

        (b) A Sentencing Order is an Order executed to impose the
            penalty for a Crime.

        (c) A Ticketing Order is an Order executed to impose the
            penalty for an Infraction.

        (d) An Appellate Order is an Order executed by a Board of
            Appeals.

        (e) A Judicial Order is an Order executed by a Judge in the
            course of performing eir duties or privileges as Judge.

        (f) An Administrative Order is an Order executed by an
            Officer in the course of performing the duties or
            privileges of that Office.  For the purpose of this
            Rule, the following positions are deemed to be Offices:

               (i) The Speaker.
              (ii) The Recordkeepor of a Currency.

        (g) Any other Order is a Private Order.

Amend Rule 1803 (Judicial Orders) to read:

      Judicial Orders and Sentencing Orders are executed by being sent
      to the Clerk of the Courts, but do not take effect until their
      publication by the Clerk of the Courts.  The Clerk of the Courts
      shall publish each Judicial Order and Sentencing Order as soon as
      possible after receiving it from the Judge who executed it.

Change the title of Rule 1803 to "Judicial and Sentencing Orders".

Amend Rule 1804 (Appeal of Judicial Orders) to read:

      As soon as possible after a Judicial Order or Sentencing Order
      is Appealed, the Clerk of the Courts shall stay it.  If the
      Appeal is sustained, then the Board of Appeals shall vacate
      this stay as soon as possible.  If the Appeal is sustained,
      then the Board of Appeals shall vacate the stayed Order as soon
      as possible.

      In the Appeal of a Judicial Order or Sentencing Order, the Board
      of Appeals shall consider whether the Order was properly and
      validly executed.

Change the title of Rule 1804 to "Appeal of Judicial and Sentencing
Orders".

Amend Rule 1827 (Granting or Denying Motions) by replacing the text
"detected and reported" with "which may be reported".

Amend Rule 1564 (Initiating Appeals) by replacing each instance of
"Judicial Order" with "Judicial or Sentencing Order".

Amend Rule 908 (Formal Apologies) to read:

      If a Player (hereafter the Ninny) is convicted of a Crime, then
      instead of executing Sentencing Orders, the Judge may (Without
      Objection) Order the Ninny to publish a Formal Apology.  Such an
      Order is known as an Order to Apologize.

      A Formal Apology must be at least 200 words, and must explain
      the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire for
      self-improvement.  Furthermore, the Order to Apologize may
      include up to ten Prescribed Words of the Judge's choice, all
      of which must appear in the Formal Apology.

      Failure to obey an Order to Apologize within 72 hours is the
      Class 3 Infraction of Shamelessness, to be reported by the
      Judge who issued the Order.

Amend Rule 1504 (Sentencing Orders) to read:

      Upon a judicial finding that an entity has committed a Crime, the
      Judge so finding shall execute, as soon as possible, either:

        a) all and only those Sentencing Orders necessary and sufficient
           to impose the penalty for that Crime; or

        b) (Without Objection) an Order to Apologize.

Amend Rule 1812 (Notices of Infraction) to read:

      If an entity (hereafter the Jaywalker) commits an Infraction,
      then any Player authorized by the Rules to report the commission
      of that Infraction (hereafter the Traffic Cop) may publish a
      Notice of Infraction.  This Notice shall explicitly specify the
      following:

        a) The Infraction that has been committed.
        b) The identity of the Jaywalker.
        c) The Rule(s) defining that action or inaction as an
           Infraction.
        d) The action or inaction by which the Jaywalker committed the
           Infraction.
        e) All and only those Ticketing Orders necessary and sufficient
           to impose the penalty for that Infraction.  The Orders are
           executed and take effect upon publication.

      When a Player publishes a Claim of Error alleging that the
      Jaywalker did not commit the Infraction, e may (in the same
      message as the COE) stay one or more of the Ticketing Orders.  If
      the COE is denied, then the Traffic Cop shall vacate the Order to
      Stay as soon as possible. If the COE is admitted, then the Traffic
      Cop shall vacate all the stayed Ticketing Orders as soon as
      possible.

      Players are encouraged to CFJ on the commission of Infractions
      only when a question of interpretation, rather than of fact,
      arises.

Amend Rule 1816 (No Double Jeopardy for Crimes) to read:

      No Player may be penalized more than once for any single action
      or inaction.

      If a non-dismissed CFJ alleges that a Player has committed a Crime
      through a given action or inaction, then any further CFJ alleging
      that the same Player has committed the same Crime through the same
      action or inaction lacks standing and shall be dismissed.

Amend Rule 1505 (Standard Classes of Crimes and Infractions) to read:

      A Class N Crime or Infraction, where N is replaced with a number,
      is a Crime or Infraction for which the penalty is N Blots.  Such
      a penalty is assessed upon the execution of a Sentencing or
      Ticketing Order that Orders the Herald to record the penalty.

      If such a Sentencing or Ticketing Order is vacated after the
      Herald has already recorded the penalty, then an equal number
      of Blots are expunged from the penalized entity.  (If the entity
      has less Blots than the amount of the penalty, then all eir Blots
      are expunged.)

Amend Rule 1439 (Blots Due to a CFJ) to read:

      Violating a Rule is the Class N Crime of Disobedience, unless
      other Rules define or prohibit a penalty for the violation.  N is
      the Power of the violated Rule (rounded down to the nearest
      multiple of the MUQ of Indulgences), but shall not exceed 4.

Change the title of Rule 1439 to "Default Penalty for Violating a Rule".

Amend Rule 1594 (Violation of SLCs) to read:

      While a Player remains within the Jurisdiction of a SLC, e is
      required to abide by it, unless doing so would violate either
      the Rules or another SLC with higher precedence.  Violation of
      this requirement is the Class 1 Crime of Insubordination.

Amend Rule 1457 (Judicial Procedure for Violations of an SLC) to read:

      Only Players within the Jurisdiction of a SLC may CFJ that a
      Player has violated that SLC.

      All Players within the Jurisdiction of a SLC are automatically
      ineligible to Judge a CFJ that a Player has violated that SLC.

Proposal 4407 by Steve, AI=2, Democratic, Sane
A Burst of Activity

[Comment:

v1.0

Activity reform, along the lines suggested by Goethe, to whom I am
grateful for his many useful ideas. Changes include:

- reversion to a 2-tier activity system, considerably simplifying R1016.
- minimum of 1 week between changes of activity level. Among other
  things, this ensures that players cannot pop in and out of being
  active without exposing themselves to debts. This replaces the current
  system, in which there is a minimum 96 hours of being inactive, and no
  minimum time being active.
- Contest and Groups specifically given the power to require inactive
  players to perform actions. Since membership is voluntary, these are
  requirements a player can avoid if e chooses to. But if e chooses to
  remain in a Group or Contest, e should not be allowed to hide behind
  inactivity. This seems fair to me.
- active -> silent takes a month, up from two weeks.
- inactive -> silent takes three months, up from two months.
- creates a new "Silent Treatment", in which the Registrar is
  required to notify the player to be deregistered of eir impending
  deregistration. The Silent Treatment takes at least a month to
  complete.

v1.1

- minor changes suggested by Goethe and harvel.

]

This Proposal has an Adoption Index of 2.

Upon the Adoption of this Proposal, all frozen Players become Inactive.

Amend Rule 1016 (Activity Levels) to read:

  (a) Each player has an activity level, which is either active or
      inactive. "Off hold" and "on hold" are unambiguous synonyms for
      "active" and "inactive", respectively.

  (b) Whenever a player registers or reregisters, e is active.

  (c) A player may change eir activity level by announcing that e does
      so, provided that a week has passed since e last changed eir
      activity level.

  (d) Inactive players may not vote, make proposals, hold office, or be
      a Judge of a CFJ.  An inactive player may not be required by the
      rules to perform any duty or action, unless the rules explicitly
      state that they can require inactive players to perform that duty
      or action.

  (e) This rule takes precedence over each other rule that regulates
      activity levels and the powers or duties that a player may have
      because of eir activity level.


Amend Rule 1042 (Deregistration Due to Silence) to read:

  (a) Each player is always noisy, quiet, or silent, but never more
      than one of these. Whenever a player registers or posts to a
      public forum, that player is noisy.

  (b) A player who has not quietened another player in the past 24 hours
      may do so by publically identifying the player and stating that e
      causes that player to become quiet.

  (c) If a player has been quiet continuously for one month, or inactive
      continuously for three months, e becomes silent.

  (d) Any player may publish a Notice of Abandonment, identifying
      another player and alleging that that player has abandoned the
      game. A Notice of Abandonment is or becomes invalid if the player
      identified in it is not, or ceases to be, silent.


Create a new Rule entitled "The Silent Treatment", with the following
text:

  (a) The publication of a Notice of Abandonment commences the
      Silent Treatment for the player identified in it.

  (b) The requirement to perform the actions described in this Rule is
      subject to the Notice of Abandonment remaining valid. If at any
      time during the Silent Treatment the Notice of Abandonment is
      invalid, then the Treatment is terminated, and the Registrar is
      relieved of all powers and responsibilities regarding it.

  (c) As soon as possible after the commencement of the Silent Treatment,
      the Registrar shall:

      (1) publically confirm whether the Notice of Abandonment was valid
          at the commencement of the Silent Treatment, and whether it
          remains valid;

      (2) publish in all designated Public Fora, and send to the
          preferred email address of the player, if e has one, a Notice
          of Intent to Deregister, identifying the player to be
          deregistered (the same as in the Notice of Abandonment), and
          announcing the Registrar's intent to deregister that player
          after one month has passed.

  (d) If the Notice of Abandonment remains valid a month after the
      publication of the Notice of Intent to Deregister, then the
      Registrar shall, as soon as possible, publish in all designated
      Public Fora, and send to the preferred email address of the
      player, if e has one, a Notice of Deregistration, identifying the
      player being deregistered (the same as in the Notice of
      Abandonment). A Notice of Deregistration is valid if and only if
      it is published by the Registrar, following the procedures
      described in this Rule.

  (e) Upon publication of a valid Notice of Deregistration, the
      following events occur in order:

      (1) if the player identified in the Notice of Deregistration is
          the Speaker, e commits the Class 15 Crime of Speaker
          Abandonment; e ceases to be Speaker, and the Speaker-Elect
          becomes Speaker;

      (2) the player identified in the Notice of Deregistration is
          deregistered;

      (3) the Silent Treatment for that player concludes.

Amend Rule 1612 (Charters of Organizations) by inserting immediately
after the first paragraph, a new paragraph which reads:

      If the Charter of an Organization requires one of its Members to
      perform an action, then that requirement applies equally to a
      Member who is inactive, unless the Charter specifically exempts
      inactive Players from the requirement.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 4408 by OscarMeyr, AI=1, Democratic
Reinstate the Points penalty for Crimes

      A Class N Infraction (where N is replaced with a number) is an
      Infraction for which the penalty is N Blots.

      A Class N Crime (where N is replaced with a number) is a
      Crime for which the penalty is N Blots and a loss of 2*N Points.

Amend R1930 [by dropping paragraph (a) and renumbering] to read:

      (a) If a Player wins a contested Election, e may be Awarded 10
          Points.

      (b) If a Player Resigns from an Office, e may be Penalized 5
          Points.

      (e) If a Revolt fails, each Rebellious Player may be Penalized
          10 Points.

      (f) If a Player submits a Disinterested Proposal which is
          Adopted, e may be Awarded 1 Point, plus 1 Point for each
          vote that was cast AGAINST the Proposal.

      (g) If a Player submits an Interested Proposal which is Adopted,
          e may be Awarded 4 Points, plus 1 Point for each vote that
          was cast AGAINST the Proposal.

      (h) If a Player is the only Player to Vote either FOR or AGAINST
          a particular Proposal that e did not write or Propose, e may
          be Awarded 2 Points.

      (i) If a Judgement is Sustained on Appeal, the original Judge
          may be Awarded 5 Points

      (j) If a Judgement is Overturned on Appeal, the original Judge
          may be Penalized 5 Points.

      (k) If a Player gains a Patent Title which e has not held during
          the 7 days prior to gaining it, e may be Awarded 5 Points.

      (l) If a Player is granted a Degree e has not previously held, e
          may be Awarded 10 Points.
