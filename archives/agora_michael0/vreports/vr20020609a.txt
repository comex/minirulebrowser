TEXT OF ADOPTED PROPOSALS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 4328 by Goethe, AI=1
Chao Chao

This is an Urgent Proposal.

Amend 1869 (Restrictions on Setting Power) to read:

      Except as described in this Rule, no entity can set the Power
      of another entity to exceed the Power of the entity causing
      the Power to be so set.  A Rule may set the Power of an adopted
      Proposal even exceeding the Power of the Rule only as follows:

          (A) If the Proposer is a Member of The Cabal (as explicitly
               defined by the Rules) when the Proposal takes effect, the
               Proposal's Power is set equal to 4;

          (B) Otherwise, Rules to the Contrary nonwithstanding, the
              Proposal's Power is set to 1.

      No entity may destroy or repeal an entity with Power greater
      than its own.

      No Rule may have Power less than 1 or greater than 4.


Amend Rule 594 (Proposals and Rule Changes) to read:

      When a Proposal takes effect:
           (a) if the Proposer is a Member of The Cabal (as explicitly
               defined by the Rules) when the Proposal takes effect,
               the Proposal's power is set equal to 4;
           (b) otherwise, its power is set equal to 1;
      and the provisions contained in the text of the Proposal are
      implemented to the maximal extent permitted by the Rules.

      Provisions which are unclear, ambiguous, or inapplicable
      are ignored.  In a Proposal containing more than one provision,
      each provision is severable from the others, unless the Proposal
      states otherwise.

      For the purpose of the Rules, the application of an adopted
      Proposal is a legal procedure for changing Nomic Properties.

      The Adoption Index of a Proposal is the maximum of 1, the value
      requested by its Proposer (if any), and the value required for
      that Proposal by the Rules (if any).

Proposal 4329 by Goethe, AI=1
Remantling

This is an Urgent Proposal.

Create the following Rule with a Power of 4, entitled "Town Fountain",
which reads (and appears) as follows:

                        /\   /\
                        / \ / \
                           T
                          his
                        Power-4
                 Rule (the first ever)
                  was placed to honor
             The Agoran  Spirit Of The Game
             by Goethe, Steve, Murphy, root
             and OscarMeyr, Scamsters. Look
             on our works, ye Marvy, but do
        always Dance a Powerful Dance.  Hail Eris!


Repeal Rule 1869.


Upmutate Rule 594 to a Power of 3.


Change the name of Rule 594 to "Power and Proposals"


Amend Rule 594 to read:

      No Rule may have Power less than 1 or greater than 4.
      Except as described in this Rule, no entity can set the Power
      of another entity to exceed the Power of the entity causing
      the Power to be so set.   No entity may destroy or repeal an
      entity with Power greater than its own.

      When a Proposal takes effect, its Power shall be set equal to
      its Adoption Index, and the provisions contained in the
      text of the Proposal are implemented to the maximal extent
      permitted by the Rules.

      The Adoption Index of a Proposal is the maximum of 1, the value
      requested by its Proposer (if any), and the value required for
      that Proposal by the Rules (if any).

      Provisions which are unclear, ambiguous, or inapplicable are
      ignored.  In a Proposal containing more than one provision, each
      provision is severable from the others, unless the Proposal states
      otherwise.

      For the purpose of the Rules, the application of an adopted
      Proposal is a legal procedure for changing Nomic Properties.



Amend Rule 2021 (Chamber Procedure) by replacing:

      An Untainted Speaker, with 2 Supporters, may Sanitise a
      Distributed Proposal for which the Voting Period has not ended.
      If this happens, the Proposal is Aborted as described elsewhere,
      but remains Distributable and becomes Democratic and Sane.

with:

      An Untainted Speaker, with 2 Supporters, may Sanitise a
      Distributed Proposal that is not already Sane and for which the
      Voting Period has not ended. If this happens, the Proposal is
      Aborted as described elsewhere, but remains Distributable and
      becomes Democratic and Sane.


Upon the adoption of this Proposal:
  - all ongoing auctions for bank currencies are cancelled,
    and all outstanding auction debts are deemed satisfied.
  - all Voting Entitlements, Papyri, and Indulgences in existence
    are destroyed;
  - all outstanding debts to and of the Bank for Bank Currencies are
    deemed to be satisfied, and all outstanding potential debts arising
    from past transfers are deemed, for the purposes of future debts,
    to have not occurred;
  - 5 Voting Entitlements, 50 Papyri, and 50 Indulgences
    are created in the possession of the Bank;
  - a quantity of Voting Entitlements, Papyri, and Indulgences equal
    to the New Player Award in each of these Currencies is created
    in the Possession of each Player.


Create a Rule entitled "Property Protection", with an AI of 2,
consisting
of the following text:

      Rules to the contrary nonwithstanding, a provision of an
      adopted Proposal that attemps to change the ownership of
      Property or create a debt by any means other than by changing
      the Ruleset shall be considered without effect, unless (a) the
      Proposal is Democratic; and (b) the Proposal has an
      Adoption Index of 2 or greater.


Repeal the Rule entitled 'The Cabal'.
