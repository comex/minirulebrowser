Text of Adopted Proposals
-------------------------

Proposal 4840 by Goethe, AI=2, Democratic
Some fixup


Proposal:  some fixup

Amend Rule 1677 by replacing:

       As soon as possible after the beginning of a player's Grace
       Period, the Registrar shall announce eir arrival.  This
       announcement shall have the effect of setting that player's
       kudos to twice the Tabla Rasa.

       If a player joins the game, but is neither subject to a Grace
       Period nor has been a player at any time since the last Turning
       of a New Parchment, then the Herald shall set eir kudos to half
       the Tabla Rasa (rounded up).

with:

       As soon as possible after the beginning of a player's Grace
       Period, the Registrar shall announce eir arrival.  This
       announcement grants the player three free pending draws.


Amend Rule 2019 by replacing the phrase 'Assessor shall a copy'
with the phrase 'Assessor shall place a copy'.


----------------------------------------------------------------------


Proposal 4841 by Goethe, AI=1, Democratic
Order categorical


Proposal:  Order categorical

Repeal Rule 1048 (Rule Categories).

Amend Rule 1681 by replacing the text:

               All existing categories must be listed, even if no
       rules are currently assigned to the category.

with the following new paragraph:

       A new Rule is assigned to a category as the Rulekeepor sees fit.
       The Rulekeepor may, without 2 objections, move Rules between
       categories, change the name of a category, and add or remove
       empty categories.


[Reducing 12 lines to 4, removing some pretty unnecessary mechanism]
