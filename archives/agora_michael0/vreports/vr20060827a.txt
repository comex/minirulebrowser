Proposal 4865 by Goethe, AI=1, Ordinary
The Lion Rampant Repeals
PROPOSAL TEXT
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal:  The Lion Rampant Repeals

[Same as previous proposal, with numbers in poem spelled out]
[Greatly simplifies patent titles and especially degrees, no more
university]

The Rule Category 'Patent Titles and Degrees' is hereby created.  All
Rules amended by this Proposal are placed or moved into this new
category.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 649 (Patent Titles) to read:

        A Patent Title is a legal item of recognition of a person's
        distinction.

        When a Patent Title is awarded to a person, that person is said
        to Bear that Patent Title.  When a Patent Title is revoked from
        a person, that person ceases to Bear that Patent Title.  The
        status of Bearing a Patent Title can only be changed as
        explicitly set out in the Rules.

        As soon as possible after the Rules state that a Patent title
        shall be awarded or revoked, the Herald shall publicly award or
        revoke that Patent Title.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 1922 (Defined Regular Patent Titles) to read:

        The following are Patent Titles:

        (a)  Scamster, which may be awarded to any Player who has shown
             great enthusiasm, persistence, or skill in the perpetrating
             of scams.  This title may not be declined, retracted, or
             revoked.

        (b)  A Patent Title (non-unique) now will
             Be known as "Bard", and granted those with wit.
             In order for the Title to be filled,
             A level of Support must call for it.

             Three players to a fourth may grant this name
             If these three write as one, with two Support.
             A current Bard may also grant the same,
             Provided that a second Bard's a sport.

             And so we don't the name of Bard debase,
             A Player with three Supporters can conspire
             To (from a Bard), this Title to erase:
             Or Bard (plus two Bards) make a Bard retire.

             But lest we ruin some poor minstrel's fun
             No bard will be dis-bard for eir bad pun.

        (c)  Three Months Long Service, Six Months Long Service, Nine
             Months Long Service, Twelve Months Long Service, to be
             awarded to any player who has held a particular Office
             continuously for the specified duration.  Each of these
             titles shall be awarded only once per player.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 1367 (Degrees) to read:

        A Patent Title is only a Degree if it is specifically made
        such by a Rule.  Persons may come to Bear Degrees only as
        specified in the Rules. Once a person Bears a Degree, e shall
        keep that Degree forever.

        This Rule takes precedence over any Rule specifying default
        properties of Patent Titles.

        The following Degrees are hereby made legal:

           - Associate of Nomic                 (A.N.)
           - Bachelor of Nomic                  (B.N.)
           - Master of Nomic                    (M.N.)
           - Doctor of Nomic History            (D.N. Hist)
           - Doctor of Nomic Science            (D.N. Sci)
           - Doctor of Nomic Philosophy         (D.N.Phil)

        Degrees shall be ranked in the order they appear in this Rule,
        with Degrees listed latest in the Rule being ranked higher.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 1370 (How to Get a Degree) to read:

       A person becomes a Candidate for a Degree when e publishes a
       Thesis along with a statement explicitly indicating that the
       Thesis is being submitted with the intent to qualify for a
       particular degree.  A Thesis (plural: Theses) is an essay
       whose topic is any facet of Agora Nomic, or Nomic in general.

       The Candidate shall choose a Player other tham emself to be
       the first member of eir Thesis Committee, called eir Chair,
       with the Chair's consent.

       If the Speaker is neither the Chair nor the Candidate, the
       Speaker shall appoint a Player who is neither the Chair nor the
       Candidate to be the second Committee member.  Otherwise, the
       the Clerk of the Courts shall so appoint.  The two Committee
       members shall then select, by mutual consent, a third person
       who is not the Candidate to be the third Committee member.

       The Committee shall examine the Candidate and eir Thesis to
       determine eir qualifications for the Degree.  The Chair of the
       Thesis Committee may award that Degree to the Candidate if and
       only if:

        * the Candidate has satisfied all prerequisites in the Rules for
          the award of that Degree;
        * a majority of members of the Thesis Committee agree that the
          Thesis is worthy of the Degree to be granted.  Attention
          should be paid to the originality and strength of the work, as
          well as the extent of the work with regard to the expectations
          of the particular degree.  The committee may award a lesser
          degree if appropriate; and
        * fewer than seven years have passed since that Committee was
          formed.

        Each Committee Member may publish a Commentary for the Thesis.
        The Rulekeepor shall retain a copy of each Thesis that has
        resulted in a degree, along with all such Commentaries.
