Proposal 4672 by Manu, AI=1, Ordinary
Shareholders Are Not Liable 1.1


Amend Rule 1505 by replacing:

       A Class N Infraction (where N is replaced with a number) is an
       Infraction for which the penalty is N Blots.  Such a penalty is
       assessed upon the execution of a Ticketing Order that Orders the
       Herald to record the penalty.

With:

       A Class N Infraction (where N is replaced with a number) is an
       Infraction for which the penalty is N Blots minus the number of
       Shares owned by the penalized entity at the time of the
       Infraction, with a minimum of 1. Such a penalty is assessed upon
       the execution of a Ticketing Order that Orders the Herald to
       record the penalty.
