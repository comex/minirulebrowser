Proposal 4612 by Murphy, AI=1, Democratic
Fix Team Wins, Mark II


Amend Rule 1929 (Points) by replacing the text "the last Team Win" with
"the last Score Reset".

Amend Rule 2053 (Team Points, Team Scores) by replacing the text "the
last Team Win" with "the last Score Reset".

Amend Rule 2042 (Team Wins) to read:

     A Team achieves a Team Win when its Team Score reaches the Team
     Points Goal, as set in the Scorekeepor's Budget.  When this
     occurs, no other Team may achieve a Team Win until after the
     next Score Reset.

     The Scorekeepor shall announce a Team Win as soon as possible
     after it occurs.  Upon this announcement, a Score Reset occurs.

     In the announcement, the Scorekeepor shall award the Boon of
     Teamwork to each Winner.

     In the announcement, the Scorekeepor shall reassign Players to
     Teams as follows, based on Scores immediately before the Score
     Reset:

     1) The Player with the highest Score in the Team with the
        highest Team Score is assigned to the Team with the lowest
        Team Score.

     2) The Player who has the lowest Score in the Team with the
        lowest Team Score is assigned as to distribute the players as
        evenly as possible among the Teams.

     3) All other Players remain assigned to the same Teams.

     If in any of the above there is a choice of more than one Player
     or Team, the Scorekeepor shall choose between the applicable
     Players or Teams as e sees fit.  The Scorekeepor shall include
     the details of the reassignments in eir announcement.

     In the announcement, the Scorekeepor may rename one or more Teams
     by specifying the new name of each Team e is renaming.

Proposal 4613 by Murphy, AI=1, Democratic
Don't Overcompensate


[This goes back to an idea implicit in "Judicial Separation":  it's
necessary to keep the Speaker separate from certain offices, but
it's not necessary to keep the Speaker-Elect separate.]

Amend the Rule titled "Quis Custodiet Ipsos Custodes?" by removing
this text:

     The Assistant Director of Personnel cannot be Nominated for
     the Office of Speaker-Elect.
