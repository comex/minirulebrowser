=========Text of adopted Proposals======================================

Proposal 4254 by Goethe, AI=2
Real Power for Roles

Repeal Rule 1980 (Becoming Parliamentary).
Repeal Rule 1934 (The Speaker, Sanity, and Buying Democracy).

Upon Passage of this Proposal, the title of Rule 1986 (The Scribes'
Council) will be changed to to 'Role-Based Powers' and its Power
increased
to 2.0.

Amend Rule 1986 (Role-Based Powers) to read:

  A Scribe may lower the Distribution Cost of a Proposal by 1
  with the Support of another Scribe, to a minimum cost of 0,
  provided the Cost of the Proposal has not already been so
  lowered.

  An Acolyte may expunge 1 Blot from any Entity with the Support
  of another Acolyte, provided the Acolyte has not so Expunged
  a Blot in the same Nomic Week.

  An Acolyte with the Support of a Scribe, or a Scribe with the
  Support of an Acolyte, may Bless an Undistributed Proposal.
  A moment after its Distribution, a Blessed Ordinary Proposal
  becomes Democratic.

  A Politician, with the Support of another Poltician, may
  Unbless an Undistributed Blessed Proposal.  An Unblessed
  Proposal is no longer Blessed.

  An Untainted Speaker, with 2 Supporters, may Sanitise a
  Distributed Proposal for which the Voting Period has not ended.
  If this happens, the Proposal is Aborted as described
  elsewhere, but remains Distributable and becomes Democratic
  and Sane.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 4255 by Steve, AI=1
Regular VE Auctions, sooner

Amend Rule 1449 (The Assessor) by appending to the end of it text which
reads:

      (c) The Assessor's Budget shall consist of the Voting
          Entitlements per Player (VEPP), a real multiple of 0.1
          between 0.5 and 2.0 inclusive.

Upon the adoption of this Proposal, the Assessor's Budget shall be set
as follows:

          Voting Entitlements per Player = 1.5.

Amend Rule 1946 (Distribution of Voting Entitlements) to read:

      (a) The Ideal Voting Entitlement Circulation Level (IVECL) is
          equal to the number of registered Players multiplied by the
          Voting Entitlements per Player as set in the Assessor's
          Budget.

      (b) The Actual Voting Entitlement Circulation Level (AVECL) is the
          total number of Voting Entitlements owned by entities other
          than the Bank, augmented by the total number of Voting
          Entitlements owned by the Bank which have been auctioned off
          to Winning Bidders in prior Voting Entitlement Auctions but
          not yet paid for.

      (c) The Voting Entitlement Surplus is the difference between the
          IVECL and the AVECL; if the AVECL is greater than the IVECL,
          the Voting Entitlement Surplus is zero.

      (d) If the Voting Entitlement Surplus is positive at the beginning
          of the month, the Assessor shall as soon as possible auction
          off the surplus Voting Entitlements. The items to be auctioned
          are lots of 0.1 VEs; the number of items is equal to the
          Voting Entitlement Surplus multiplied by 10, rounded down to
          the nearest integer.  The Auctioneer shall be the Assessor,
          and the Auction shall be conducted in Stems. Only Politicians
          may bid.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 4256 by Murphy, AI=1
Fix Embezzlement

Amend Rule 1981 (Embezzlement and Receiving Stolen Property) by
replacing this text:

      (c) An entity which receives Property from any entity as the
          result of an intentional, valid and unauthorized transfer
          incurs a debt to the transferor for all such Property.

with this text:

      (c) An entity which receives Property as the result of a valid
          but unauthorized transfer incurs a debt to the Payor of that
          transfer for all Property thus received.

Amend Rule 1596 (Debt) by removing this text:

      (e) An entity which receives Property as the result of an
          unauthorized transfer incurs a debt for the transferred
          Property to the entity that made the transfer.

and by changing the text "(f)" to "(e)".

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 4257 by Murphy, AI=1
Streamline Referendum and Election Voting

Amend Rule 1434 (Default Procedure for Referendum Voting) to read:

      When a Referendum Vote is required and the procedure is not
      defined elsewhere, the following Standard Referendum Voting
      Procedure shall be used.  Details specified herein are defaults
      which may be modified by other Rules for specific situations.

      This procedure shall under no circumstances be used for Voting
      on Proposals, unless specifically required by the Rules
      governing specific types of Proposals.

      * Vote Collector:  The Vote Collector is responsible for
      collecting and tallying the Votes, and announcing the results.
      The Vote Collector is the Speaker at the time the Referendum
      begins.

      * Disappearance of Vote Collector:  If the Vote Collector
      deregisters or is deregistered before announcing the results of
      the Referendum, then the Referendum fails.

      * Voters:  A Voter is an entity permitted to Vote on a Referendum.
      Only Active Players are Voters.  Activity is measured at the time
      a Vote is sent.

      * Voting:  A Voter Votes by sending eir Vote to the Vote Collector
      during the Voting Period, indicating what Referendum e is Voting
      on, and what eir Vote is.

      * Vote Values:  A Vote is FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN.  Words which
      are effectively synonymous with these are also permissible.

      * Vote Strength:  Every Vote has equal strength.  No Voter may
      Vote more than once on any single Referendum.

      * Retraction:  A Vote, once sent to the Vote Collector, cannot be
      changed.

      * Start of Voting:  The Voting Period begins at the time of the
      first correct and legal public announcement that a Referendum has
      begun, as defined in other Rules.  Such an announcement must
      include the identity of the Vote Collector.

      * Duration of Voting:  The Voting Period lasts for one Week.  All
      Votes received by the Vote Collector outside of the Voting Period
      have no effect.

      * Secrecy During Voting:  At any time, the Vote Collector may
      publish a list of Voters who have Voted.  However, the Vote
      Collector shall not reveal the value of any Voter's Vote to anyone
      but that Voter, unless e has the Voter's permission to do so.

      * Announcement of Results:  As soon as possible after the end of
      the Voting Period, the Vote Collector shall announce the number of
      Votes of each kind, as well as the name and Vote of each Entity
      that Voted. If e does not do this as soon as possible, then the
      Referendum fails.

      * Quorum:  Quorum is 50% of the eligible Voters at the beginning
      of the Voting Period.  If fewer Voters Vote, then the Referendum
      fails.

      * Adoption Index:  The Adoption Index of a Referendum is 1.

      * Adoption Ratio:  The Adoption Ratio of a Referendum is the ratio
      of FOR Votes to AGAINST Votes.  If the Adoption Ratio is greater than
      the Adoption Index (or if both are Unanimity), and if the Referendum
      does not fail for some other reason, then it passes; otherwise, it
      fails.

      * Effectiveness:  A Referendum takes effect when the Vote Collector
      correctly announces that it passes.  The effect of a Referendum is
      defined by other Rules.

      * Cutoff for Challenges:  If the results of a Referendum are not
      challenged within seven days after the Vote Collector announces
      them, then the announced results are the true results of that
      Referendum, even if they would otherwise be in error.

Amend Rule 1445 (Defaults for Elections) to read:

      When an Election is required and the procedure is not defined
      elsewhere, the following Standard Election Procedure shall be
      used.  Details specified herein are defaults which may be
      modified by other Rules for specific situations.

      * Vote Collector:  The Vote Collector is responsible for taking
      nominations, collecting and tallying the Votes, and announcing
      the results.  The Vote Collector is the Speaker at the time the
      Election begins.

      * Disappearance of Vote Collector:  If the Vote Collector
      deregisters or is deregistered before announcing the winner of
      the Election, then the Election has no winner.

      * Nominator:  A Nominator is an entity permitted to Nominate a
      Candidate in an Election.  Only Active Players are Nominators.
      Activity is measured at the time a Nomination is sent.

      * Prospective:  A Prospective is an entity permitted to be
      Nominated as a Candidate in an Election.  Only Active Players
      are Prospectives.  Activity is measured at the time a Nomination
      is sent.

      * Nominating:  A Nominator Nominates a Prospective by sending a
      message to the Vote Collector during the Nominating Period,
      indicating the Election and the Prospective.  If the Prospective
      is not explicitly identified, then it is the same as the Nominator.

      * Candidates:  A Candidate for an Election is a Prospective who has
      been Nominated in that Election.

      * Retraction:  A Nominator may retract eir Nomination by sending a
      message to the Vote Collector during the Nominating Period,
      indicating the Election and the Prospective.  If the Prospective
      is not explicitly identified, then it is the same as the Nominator.

      * Declination:  A Prospective may decline eir Nomination by sending
      a message to the Vote Collector during the Nominating Period,
      indicating the Election.  Upon doing so, e may not be re-Nominated
      in that Election by anyone but emself.

      * Mode of Nominations:  There are three Modes of Nominations:
      Selfish, Selfless, or Open.  The Vote Collector may specify a Mode
      of Nominations when e announces the start of the Election; if e
      does not, then the Mode is Selfish.

        (a) In a Selfish Election, a Nominator may Nominate only emself.
        (b) In a Selfless Election, a Nominator may not Nominate emself.
        (c) In an Open Election, a Nominator may Nominate any Prospective.

      * Start of Nominations:  The Nominating Period begins at the
      time of the first correct and legal announcement that an Election
      has begun, as defined in other Rules.  Such an announcement must
      include the identity of the Vote Collector.

      * Duration of Nominations:  The Nominating Period lasts for one
      Week.  All Nominations received by the Vote Collector outside of
      the Nominating Period have no effect.

      * Secrecy:  Nominations need not be kept secret.

      * End of Nominations:  As soon as possible after the end of the
      Nominating Period, the Vote Collector shall publish a list of
      all Candidates.  If e does not do this as soon as possible, then
      the Election has no winner.

      If there are no Candidates, then the Election has no winner.

      If there is exactly one Candidate, then e is the winner of that
      Election.

      If there are two or more Candidates, then a Referendum begins
      when the Vote Collector publishes the list of Candidates.  This
      is a standard Referendum, with the following exceptions:

      * Vote Collector:  The Vote Collector for the Referendum is the
      same as the Vote Collector for the Election.

      * Vote Values:  A Vote is the name of exactly one Candidate for
      the given Election.  Words which are effectively synonymous with
      these are also permissible.

      * Failure of Referendum:  If the Referendum fails for any reason
      (e.g. Quorum is not achieved), then the Election has no winner.

      * Adoption:  The winner of the Election is the Candidate for whom
      the most Votes were cast.  If two or more Candidates are tied for
      most Votes, then the Speaker shall choose one of those Candidates,
      who becomes the winner when the Speaker announces eir choice.  The
      Speaker shall announce eir choice as soon as possible after the
      Vote Collector announces the results of Voting.

      * Effectiveness:  An Election takes effect when the Vote Collector
      correctly announces the identity of its winner.  The effect of an
      Election is defined by other Rules.
