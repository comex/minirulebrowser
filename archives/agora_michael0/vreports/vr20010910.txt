harvel sent separate messages to a-b and agora@win.tue.nl, each claiming to
vote (2A,1F,2F,1A).  I consider this to have aggregate effect (2A,2F,2F,2A)
because harvel is a Middle Oligarch and may vote up to twice per Ordinary
Proposal, and because the messages were clearly separate.  If there is any
precedent to the contrary, then please let me know.  This does not affect
the adoption or rejection of any Proposal.

neil sent separate messages to a-b and agora@win.tue.nl, each claiming to
vote (1-,1F,1F,1F).  This has aggregate effect (1-,1F,1F,1F) because neil is a
Low Oligarch and may vote up to once per Ordinary Proposal.

Proposal #4210 by neil, AI=1
Land Auctions and Tolls

Create the following Rule, titled `Land Auctions'
      As soon as possible after the tenth day of each Month, the
      Mapkeepor shall, if the number of units of Land held by players
      is less than one half the total number of units of Land, auction
      a number of units of Land not to exceed 10.  The units of Land
      to be Auctioned are:
        * if there exist at least 10 Units of non-Aether Land in the
          possession of the Land Bureau: any 10 such Units of Land, to
          be chosen by the Mapkeepor;
        * if there exist fewer than 10 Units of non-Aether Land in the
          possession of the Land Bureau: all such Units.

      There shall be a separate Auction for each Unit of Land under
      consideration.  These Auctions shall be conducted concurrently.
      For each of these Auctions:
        * The item to be Auctioned is the piece of Land in question.
        * The Procedure to be used is the Vickrey Auction.
        * The Auctioneer shall be the Mapkeepor.
        * The Auction shall be conducted in Indulgences.

Create the following Rule, titled `Tolls'
      A Player who owns Land may impose a Toll on any (currently
      un-Tolled) piece of Land e owns.  To do so, e must pay a Fee of
      0.2 Indulgences and clearly and unambiguously identify the Unit
      of Land in question, as well as the amount of the Toll for that
      Unit of Land.

      A Toll is a number of VEs, Indulgences, or Papyri.  No Unit of
      Land may have a Toll in other currencies, or in more than one
      of these currencies.  No Toll shall be greater than 200 times
      the MUQ of the currency in which it is denominated.
      If a Player (the Tollee) Moves into a Unit of Land which is at
      the time owned by another Player (the Toller), and for which
      there is at the time a Toll established, e (the Tollee) is said
      to be In Toll to the Unit of Land in question, for the amount of
      the Toll on that unit of land (at the time of the Move)

      The owner (Toller) of a Unit of Land may notify the Mapkeepor
      that e believes a Player has been In Toll to a Unit of Land
      owned by em; to do so, e submits a Notification of Toll, which
      must unambiguously describe the Unit of Land in question, the
      amount of the Toll, and the Player (alleged Tollee) in question.
      The alleged Move must have occurred within the past week.  A
      Player may submit only one such Notification for a given Unit of
      Land in a single week, and may not submit substantially the same
      Notification two weeks in a row.  Any Notification of Toll
      contrary to this Rule is invalid and shall be discarded.

      If, in the Mapkeepor's determination, the alleged Tollee was in
      fact, in the week before the Notification, In Toll to the
      specified Unit of Land for the specified amount, the Mapkeepor
      shall confirm the Toll by publicly informing the Tollee and the
      Toller.  The Tollee then incurs to the Toller a debt equal to
      the Toll specified in the Notification.  If, in the Mapkeepor's
      determination, the alleged Tollee was not In Toll to the
      specified Unit of Land for the specified amount, e shall deny
      the Notification by informing the Toller of eir determination.

      If the Mapkeepor fails to respond to a valid Notification of
      Toll, e commits the Class 2 Crime of Looking the Other Way.  If
      the Mapkeepor confirms a Notification of Toll when in fact the
      alleged Tollee was not In Toll to the specified Unit of Land
      for the specified amount, e (the Mapkeepor) commits the Class 3
      Crime of Conspiracy to Commit Highway Robbery.  If the Mapkeeper
      denies a Notification of Toll when in fact the alleged Tollee
      was In Toll to the specified Unit of Land for the specified
      amount, e (the Mapkeepor) commits the Class 3 Crime of Not
      Feeding the Toll Under the Bridge.

      A Player may remove a Toll from any Tolled Unit of Land e owns.
      If a Player loses possession of a Unit of Land, all Tolls
      imposed on that Unit by that Player are removed.

[ If `Moving in Arcadia' doesn't pass, this is going to be a rather
  silly Rule.  Also, note that the Mapkeepor's Report need not list
  the Moves taken by Players; thus, Players must be careful about what
  Land they Toll, since movement through most Land is not easily
  detectible. ]

The Land Bureau is ordered to transfer the unit of Land located at
(0,0) to the Bank.

Proposal #4211 by harvel, AI=1
None Of You Zombies...

======================================================================
Section 0: Zombies Deserve Their Rest
======================================================================

Be it hereby resolved, that all Zombies are hereby deregistered.

======================================================================
Section 1: Lest We Forget
======================================================================

Amend Rule 1976 (Mentor's Bonus) is by striking the sentence: "A
Zombie may not make such an award.".

Amend Rule 1042 (Zombification Due to Silence) to read:

        Each player is always Noisy, Quiet, or Silent, but never more
        than one of these.  Whenever a player registers or posts to a
        public forum, that player is Noisy.

        A player who has not within the most recent 24 hours caused
        another player to become Quiet may cause another Active Noisy
        player to become Quiet by sending a message to a public forum
        in which e identifies the player and states that e causes that
        player to become Quiet.  Whenever a player has been Quiet
        continuously for two weeks or has been Inactive continuously
        for two months, e becomes Silent.

        Any player may publicly allege that some other player has
        abandoned the game.  A player has abandoned the game if and
        only if e is Silent.  As soon as possible after a public
        allegation that a player has abandoned the game, the Registrar
        shall publicly confirm or deny the allegation.

        If the allegation is confirmed, then the following events
        shall occur in order:

         (i) if the Silent player is the Speaker, e commits the Class
             15 Crime of Speaker Abandonment and ceases to be Speaker,
             and the Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker;

        (ii) the Silent player is deregistered.

        The Silent player shall be deemed to have been deregistered as
        of the timestamp of the message from the Registrar confirming
        the allegation.

Change the title of Rule 1042 to "Deregistration Due to Silence".

Amend Rule 1755 to read:

        Whenever a player is deregistered, e ceases to be a candidate,
        officer, judge, or in general to occupy any role or position
        to which the rules assign any duties or powers.  No one who is
        not registered may occupy such a role or position, unless at
        least one of the rules defining the role or position
        explicitly indicate it may be occupied by a nonplayer.

        Bearing a Patent Title shall not be deemed to be occupying a
        role or position.

        This rule shall not act to prevent a nonplayer from
        registering, calling for judgement, or otherwise doing things
        that nonplayers are generally able to do.

Amend Rule 1841 (Granting Power of Attorney) by replacing the text
reading:

        (f) Other Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, no Player who
            has granted PoA to another Player as described in this rule
            shall become a Zombie while the grant of PoA is in effect.

with text reading:

        (f) Other Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, no Player who
            has granted PoA to another Player as described in this rule
            shall be deregistered while the grant of PoA is in effect.

Amend Rule 1992 (Monks) to read:

        A player is Sanctimonious if e satisfies all of the following
        conditions:

        1. E possesses less than four times the Basic Officer Salary
           of Stems.
        2. E does not possess any Voting Entitlement.s
        3. E is a Senator.
        4. E is not the Executor or Limited Executor of any entity
           other than emself, the Bank, or Monastery which possesses
           Voting Entitlements or Stems.
        5. E is Immaculate.

        A player who has been Sanctimonious continuously for the most
        recent week becomes a Monk by notifying the Registrar that e
        becomes a Monk.  Whenever a Monk has not satisfied all
        conditions for Sanctimony for at least 48 hours, any player
        may report this to the Registrar.  On the Registrar's public
        confirmation of this report, the Monk ceases to be a Monk.

Amend Rule 1555 (Electees and Removal from Office) by replacing the
text reading: 

        If a Player goes On Hold, deregisters, is deregistered, or
        becomes a Zombie, e is removed from all Offices e holds.

with text reading:

        If a Player goes On Hold, deregisters, or is deregistered, e
        is removed from all Offices e holds.

Amend Rule 559 (The Registrar) to read:

        There exists the Office of Registrar, whose responsibility it
        is to maintain a list of players.

        The Registrar's Report shall include all of the following
        information:

           (i) a list of all registered players, with their nicknames,
               if any, and preferred email addresses;

          (ii) a list of all Grace Periods in progress, including the
               player subject to the Grace period, the time at which
               it started, and the time at which it will end;

         (iii) a list of all Unready players;

          (iv) the most recent date on which each registered player
               registered;

           (v) each player's Active/Inactive status, and the most
               recent date on which that player became Active or
               Inactive;

          (vi) each player's Noisy/Quiet/Silent status, and the most
               recent date on which that player became Noisy, Quiet,
               or Silent;

         (vii) the identities of the Distributor and the Speaker (and
               eir Term of Service); and

        (viii) a list of players who are Monks.


======================================================================

======================================================================

Repeal Rule 1884 (Zombie Masters).
Repeal Rule 1885 (Zombie Auctions).
Repeal Rule 1948 (Zombie Transfer Tax).
Repeal Rule 1886 (Vivification Due to Noise).
Repeal Rule 1924 (Living Twice Shall Have Its Price).

======================================================================
Section 3: Filling The Void In All Our Lives
======================================================================

Amend Rule 1910 (Stems) to read:

        Stems are a Bank Currency.  The MUQ of Stems is 1.  The
        Recordkeepor for Stems is the Payroll Clerk.

        Transfers of Stems are permitted only if at least one of the
        following is true:

        (1) either the transferor or the transferee is the Bank;
        (2) the Stems are to be transferred from a Dissolute to a
            player who has the privilege of Looting the Corpse of that
            Dissolute; or
        (3) the transferor is an Organization, and the Stems to be
            transferred had not been held continuously by the
            Organization for one week.

        All other transfers of Stems are prohibited.

Amend Rule 1908 (Abandoned Property) to read:

        Property possessed by an entity (the Dissolute) without a
        Prime Executor is deemed to be abandoned as long as it is
        possessed by the Dissolute.

        The Notary is a Limited Executor of each Dissolute, on behalf
        of whom e may:

        (1) transfer property owned by em to any creditor of any of
            eir debts, for the purpose of making partial or complete
            payment on those debts;

        (2) forgive in part or in full any debts owed to em;

        (3) Without Objection, transfer property owned by em to the
            Bank, unless the Dissolute was a player before eir
            property was abandoned; or
        
        (4) transfer property to satisfy the Dissolute's Will,
            provided that the Dissolute was not Silent when e lost eir
            Prime Executor and all debts for that type of property
            that the Dissolute had when e lost eir Prime Executor have
            been satisfied. 
            
        If any entity possessing property dies, dissolves, or
        otherwise ceases to exist, that entity shall be deemed to
        exist for as long as e possesses property.

Create a Rule, titled "Looting Auctions" and reading:

        As soon as possible after a player becomes a Dissolute, the
        Notary shall initiate an Auction for the privilege of Looting
        the Corpse of the Dissolute.  Once a Looting Auction begins,
        the Notary may not transfer property on behalf of the
        Dissolute until either the Auction ends without any winning
        bids or the winning bidder defaults on eir bid or loses eir
        privilege to Loot the Corpse of that Dissolute.

        Looting Auctions shall follow the default procedure for
        Auctions with the following modifications:

        (1) The Auctioneer shall be the Notary.
        (2) The Auction Currency shall be Indulgences.
        (3) The Starting Price shall be the number of Blots the
            Dissolute had when e became a Dissolute, or one Indulgence
            if the Dissolute was Immaculate.
        (4) The Auction shall be for a temporary privilege, not for an
            item, and so no debt of items to the winning Bidder when
            eir bill is paid shall be incurred.

        If there are no winning bids for the privilege of Looting the
        Corpse of that Dissolute, the Notary must, as soon as possible
        after the end of the Looting Auction, transfer all the
        Dissolute's property to the Bank.

        When the winning bidder pays eir bill from the Looting
        Auction, e gains the privilege of Looting the Corpse of that
        Dissolute; e becomes a Limited Executor of the Dissolute, with
        the authority to transfer property from the Dissolute to
        emself.  One week after e gains this privilege, e loses it,
        and ceases to be a Limited Executor of the Dissolute.  If the
        Dissolute still has property after the winning bidder loses
        this privilege, the Notary must transfer the Dissolute's
        remaining property to the Bank as soon as possible afterward.
