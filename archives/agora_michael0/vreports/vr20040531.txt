          follows:

            * A Player:
                  (a) two plus that Player's Voting Potential if that
                      Player has zero Share Holdings.
                  (b) one plus that Player's Voting Potential
                      otherwise.

            * Any other entity: as defined in the Rules, with a
              default of zero if the Rules don't specify the Voting

      (c) The value of an entity's Voting Power for any given Chamber
          at the beginning of each Week shall be in effect for all

          the Voting Power of each entity for that Proposal is
          redetermined at the time the Chamber is changed.

        considered to possess X shares (cumulative with any other
        Cards).
