Proposal 4170 by Elysion, AI=2
Justiciar Option

[This proposal:
      * Adds the option of filing any CFJ with the Justiciar
      * Removes some wordy language from rule 991
      * Establishes CFJ as the official abbrevation for Call for
        Judgement
 Recent history:
      * Changed "Any Player" to "Any person" ]

Amend rule 991/3 (Invoking Judgement, Power=2) to read:

      Any person may seek formal resolution of any dispute pertaining
      to this Nomic by submitting a Call for Judgement (CFJ) to the Clerk
      of the Courts or Justiciar. Any document submitted to the Clerk
      of the Courts or Justiciar and which is clearly marked as a
      Call for Judgement is a Call for Judgement. (Although any CFJ
      may be filed with the Justiciar, Players are encouraged to file
      with the CotC unless there is a good reason not to.)
      
      For the purpose of this and other Rules, the submission of a CFJ
      shall constitute proof of the existence of a dispute.

      The Clerk shall distribute the text of a CFJ along with any
      additional material submitted by the Caller (including, but not
      limited to, Arguments and Evidence) not later than the time e
      announces the identity of the first Judge assigned to Judge it.
      However, if the CFJ is submitted to the Justiciar, e shall
      perform all duties of the Clerk of the Courts with respect
      to that CFJ.

Repeal rule 1831/0 (Filing a CFJ with the Justiciar)

[No longer needed.]

Proposal 4171 by Blob, AI=1
Bonds revisited 1.2

Amend Rule 1970 (The Usuror) to read:

      The Office of the Usuror is hereby established.
 
      The Usuror is a Limited Executor of the Bank, with the authority 
      to satisfy debts of Bonds owed by the Bank to its creditors.

Create a rule with title "The Usuror's Budget" and text:

      The Usuror shall have a Budget.  The Usuror's Budget shall
      consist of the following items:

        (i) The Basic Fee for issuing Bonds.  This Fee shall be
            expressed as a multiple of the Basic Officer Salary and
            shall be an integral multiple of 0.1, not less than 0, and
            not greater than 4.

       (ii) The purchase rates at which the Bank will buy Bonds in 
            each Bank Currency. These rates are expressed as percentages, 
            in the range 0% to 100% inclusive. Each purchase rate applies
            only to a single combination of face value and time to
            maturity. Different rates may apply to different such
            combinations. Any combination for which no rate is
            specified has a purchase rate of 0%.

      (iii) The Credit Limit for Stems which is a multiple of the 
            Basic Officer Salary, between 0 and 10 inclusive.

       (iv) The Credit Limit for each Bank currency, other than Stems,
            which is a multiple of the MUQ of that Currency between
            0 and 10 inclusive.
 
Amend Rule 1978 (Credit and Credit Limits) to read:

      A Player's current credit in a given currency is equal to the sum 
      of the values of all Bonds owned by the Bank issued by that Player 
      with a face value in that currency. Each Player's credit value in 
      each currency shall be part of the Usuror's Weekly Report.

      The sale of a Bond is permitted only if it would not cause that
      Player's credit to exceed the Credit Limit in the currency in 
      question as set forth in the Usuror's Budget.

[History:

 v1.0 - Usuror is limited executor in charge of Bonds and bond-related debts
        Split Usuror's Budget into a separate rule.

 v1.1 - At Kelly's recommendation, I removed the Usuror's ability to 
        satisfy debts arising from Bond redemption.

 v1.2 - Added amendments to allow Bank loans in currencies other than Stems.

Proposal 4172 by root, AI=1
Fix Mentor's Bonus

Amend Rule 1976 to read:

       In the four weeks immediately after eir Grace Period ends, a
       Player can award a Mentor's Bonus to any other player e deems
       to have been most helpful to em as a new Player. E can only
       make one such award. A Zombie may not make such an award.

       The award is made by public announcement. Upon such an
       announcement the Bank shall incur a debt in Stems to the named
       Mentor equal to the New Player Award for Stems.

Proposal 4173 by Goethe, AI=1
A Hero's Reward

Proposal:  A Hero's Reward
[
 - v 1.1 corrected Agora's age.
 - v 1.2 Added wording in accordance with Rule 651
         Added clarification amendment to Rule 651 itself
]

 WHEREAS in June, 1993, Originator Chuck Carroll did compose
 an Initial Ruleset for the game of Agora Nomic, and in doing
 so, raised, from the dissolution and chaos of its predecessors,
 the Phoenix that is the Spirit of the Game;

 And WHEREAS, for eight long years, this Initial Ruleset has
 formed the basis of a Fellowship, Forged in e-mail, Acted in
 Fora, and Argued in sleepless nights and countless stolen hours
 from work;

 And WHEREAS, this Initial Ruleset has served as a model
 for long-distance Nomics of many a variety and color;

 And WHEREAS, during this time, this Person, under the nickname
 Chuck, did strive In Perpetuity to maintain the Form and
 Integrity of this Ruleset despite its constant propensity for
 Haywire and Change;

 And WHEREAS, having served to Keep this Ruleset, said person
 Chuck Carroll is no longer a Player in Agora, having moved
 on to be known to us only in occasional visitations;

 BUT IT IS SEEN that e remains embodied in Agora, in the
 Form of the Rules e created and thus in the aforementioned
 Spirit of the Game;

 BE IT HEREBY RESOLVED that at the moment June 30, 2001,
 00:04:30 GMT +1200, being the moment of Agora's Birthday, and
 being the end of the Eigth Year of Agora and the beginning
 of Year Nine;

 THAT AT THAT MOMENT IT SHALL BECOME KNOWN TO THE WORLD, by the
 Grace of this Proposal, that the no-longer-a-Player and original
 Agoran, Chuck Carroll, is a person who gave outstanding service
 to Agora Nomic AND Nomics as a whole.  Let em therefore be granted
 every Agoran status due by the Rules to one who has given such
 service.

 AND LET IT BE KNOWN In Perpetuity, or at least until the
 occasion of eir re-joining the Great Agoran Game.


 FINALLY, let Rule 651 (Heros) be Modified as follows:

    Replace the sentence:
       No Player may Bear the Patent Title of Hero.
     with the sentence:
       If a person Bearing the Patent Title of Hero is
       registered as a Player, e shall cease to Bear that
       Patent Title.
