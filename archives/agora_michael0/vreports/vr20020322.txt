Proposal #4271 by Murphy, AI=1
Streamline Succession and Delegation

Amend Rule 880 (Resignation of Offices) to read:

      The holder of an Office may resign from it by announcing
      that e does so.

      If the holder of an Office is its Electee, and appoints a
      successor when e resigns, then:

        (a) The resigning Player is retired from that Office.
        (b) If the successor consents within a week, then e
            becomes holder of that Office.
        (c) If the successor does not consent within a week,
            then the resigning Player is removed from that Office.

      Otherwise, the resigning Player is immediately removed from
      that Office.

Amend Rule 1645 (Temporary Delegation of Office) to read:

      An Office is Delegated when all of these conditions are met:

        (a) The holder (hereafter known as the Delegating Player)
            publishes a Notice of Delegation, naming the Office,
            another Player (hereafter known as the Delegated Player),
            and a Period of Delegation no longer than three weeks.

        (b) The Delegating Player is Electee to the Office, or is the
            Speaker.  This condition must hold when e publishes the
            Notice of Delegation, and must also hold at the beginning
            of the Period of Delegation.

        (c) The Delegated Player is permitted by the Rules to hold the
            Office at the beginning of the Period of Delegation.

        (d) The Delegated Player consents to the Delegation within
            seven days of the publication of the Notice of Delegation.

        (e) The Period of Delegation has begun and not yet ended.

      The Period of Delegation begins when the Notice of Delegation is
      published, or when consent is given, or at the time (if any)
      specified in the Notice of Delegation, whichever is latest.

      The Period of Delegation ends after the duration specified in the
      Notice of Delegation has elapsed, or when a Player other than the
      Delegating Player becomes Electee to the Office.

      During the Period of Delegation, the Delegated Player holds the
      Office, and earns its Salary as specified by other Rules.

      At the end of the Period of Delegation, if the Office has an
      Electee, then the Electee holds the Office; otherwise, the
      Delegated Player continues to hold the Office.

Proposal #4272 by Murphy, AI=1
Streamline Blots

Change the title of Rule 1435 (Definition of Indulgences, Blots, and
Immaculate) to "Indulgences", and amend it to read:

      Indulgences are a Bank Currency. The Minimum Unit Quantity (MUQ)
      of Indulgences is 0.001.  The Recordkeepor for Indulgences is
      the Herald.

Create a new Rule titled "Blots" with this text:

      A entity's Stain is a measure of that entity's cleanliness,
      measured in Blots.  The Stain of each entity is at all times a
      non-negative number.

      If the Rules state that an entity gains, is assessed, or is
      penalised some number of Blots, then, as soon as possible after
      the Herald is informed of the change, e shall record an increase
      of that amount in the entity's Stain.  (If the entity was an
      Unready Player at the time of the change, then the Herald shall
      instead record an increase of half that amount.)

      If the Rules state that some number of a entity's Blots are
      expunged, then, as soon as possible after the Herald is informed
      of the change, e shall record a decrease of that amount in the
      entity's Stain.  (If this would result in a negative Stain, then
      it instead results in a Stain of zero.)

Create a new Rule titled "Expunging Blots with Indulgences" with this text:

      When an entity transfers an amount of Indulgences to the Bank,
      and specifies in the Notice of Transfer that the transfer is for
      the purpose of expunging the Blots of a specified entity, then an
      equal amount of the entity's Blots are expunged.  (If the amount
      of the transfer exceeds the entity's Stain at the time of the
      transfer, then all of the entity's Blots are expunged, and the
      Bank incurs an Indulgence debt to the transferor equal to the
      amount of the original transfer minus the entity's previous Stain.)

Change the title of Rule 1962 (Win by Blots) to "Immaculate Players", and amend
it to read:

      An Immaculate Player is a Player whose Stain is zero.

      Not being Immaculate is a Win-Preventing Condition.

      Being the only Immaculate Player is a Win Condition.  Upon the
      report of such a Win, the Herald shall expunge N Blots per
      Player, where N is the Stain of the Player(s) with the lowest
      non-zero Stain.

Amend Rule 1437 (Fugitives from Justice) to read:

      When a Player deregisters or is deregistered, e keeps eir Stain
      (though it may be modified by other Rules).  A non-Player with a
      non-zero Stain is known as a Fugitive from Justice.

      At the beginning of the month, the Herald shall expunge half the
      Blots of each Fugitive from Justice; however, no Fugitive from
      Justice shall have eir Stain reduced to less than one by this
      method.

Amend Rule 1377 (The Herald) by replacing the text "number of Blots staining
the records" with "Stain".

Amend Rule 1712 (Distribution of Indulgences) by replacing the text "total
number of Blots held by Players" with "total Stain of all Players".

Amend Rule 1714 (Lawlessness) by replacing this text:

      A Player is Lawless if more than 20 Blots stain eir record.

with this text:

      A Lawless Player is a Player with more than 20 Blots.

Amend Rule 1747 (Pardoning Lawlessness) by replacing this text:

         i) The Clerk of the Courts shall expunge as many of the Blots
            staining the Fugitive's record as required to reduce the
            number of Blots to one less than the threshold for
            Lawlessness and notify the Herald of this action.

with this text:

         i) The Clerk of the Courts shall expunge as many of the
            Fugitive's Blots as required to reduce eir Stain to
            one less than the threshold for Lawlessness, and notify
            the Herald of this action.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal #4273 by Murphy, AI=1
Simplify TIA

Amend Rule 1497 (Truth in Advertising) by replacing this text:

      For the purposes of this Rule, a false statement of fact is made
      "willfully" when the Player making it, at the time the statement
      was made, has the intention to make a false statement of fact
      and knowledge that the statement actually made was false.
      Particularly, a Player who makes a false statement of fact
      through excusable negligence, reasonable error, or reasonable
      reliance on the representations of another, shall not be
      considered to have willfully made a false statement of fact.

      A conclusion as to the interpretation of the Rules or their
      application to a particular situation is not a "statement of
      fact".

with this text:

      For the purpose of this Rule, for a Player to "willfully make a
      false statement of fact", all of the following conditions must
      be true at the time the Player makes the statement.

        a) The Player must present the statement as if it were true.

        b) The Player must know that the statement is false.  In
           particular, the following things are not willful:  excusable
           negligence, reasonable error, or reasonable reliance on the
           representations of another.

        c) The statement is not a conclusion as to the interpretation
           of the Rules, or as to their application to a particular
           situation.
