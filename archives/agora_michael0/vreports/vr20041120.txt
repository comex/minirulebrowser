Crimson Go


[Apologies to Murphy for the partial theft]

Create a new rule titled "Takeover Proposals" with Power=2 and
this text:

       Initiative is a stuck player switch, tracked by the Assessor,
       with values Gote and Sente.

         (a) It is labelled as a Takeover Proposal.
         (b) No Takeover Proposal has been submitted earlier in the
             same month.
         (c) It specifies a set of players (hereafter the Corporate
             Raiders) that is no larger than P/2 or smaller than P/3,
             where P is the number of active noisy players at the time
             of submission.

       Rules to the Contrary nonwithstanding, a Takeover Proposal is
       both Democratic and Sane.

       At the beginning of a Takeover Proposal's voting period, all
       players have their initiative flipped to Gote.  At the end of a
       Takeover Proposal's voting period, all players have their
       initiative flipped as follows:
         (a) Adopted:  All Corporate Raiders gain Sente.
         (b) Rejected:  All other players gain Sente.
         (c) Failed quorum:  No one gains Sente.

                       Player has zero Share Holdings.
                   (b) one plus that Player's Voting Potential
                       otherwise.

             * Any other entity: as defined in the Rules, with a
               default of zero if the Rules don't specify the Voting
               power on a Democratic Proposal for that entity.

       (b) An entity's Voting Power on a Democratic Proposal is as
           follows:

                        has Sente.
                   (ii) one otherwise.
           (2) Any other entity: as defined in the Rules, with a
               default of zero if the Rules don't specify the Voting
               power on a Democratic Proposal for that entity.


Amend Rule 1664 (Rebellion) by replacing:
          - All Stock Cards in the possession of Abiding Players are
            returned to the Deck

        of 2 or greater.  Rules to the contrary nonwithstanding, if the
        current value of the Political Charge cannot be determined by
        reasonable effort, it shall be considered to be reset to 4.  The
        Assessor is responsible for tracking the current Political
        Charge.
