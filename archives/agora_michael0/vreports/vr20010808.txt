Proposal #4197 by Goethe, AI=2
Arcadia 4.0

[v 1.0  -Introduced Land.
 v 2.0  -Made much more general in many ways.
 v 3.0  -An island, surrounded by the Aether.
 v 4.0  -This Land, This Ruleset. ]

A category of the Ruleset is created entitled "The Land of Arcadia".


The following Rule is created (The Land of Arcadia) with a Power of 2:

           Arcadia is a land entirely defined by the Arcadian
           Map (the Map).  The Map is a record kept by the
           Office of the Mapkeepor.

           The Map divides Arcadia into a finite, discrete number
           of Units of Land, or simply Land.  Each Unit of Land is a
           unique instance of nonfungible Property specified by a pair
           of integers known as its Latitude and Longitude.

           Every unique pair of integers within the limits defined
           in the Rules for Latitude and Longitude signifies an
           existent Unit of Land.  No other Units of Land may exist.
           Units of Land may only be created or destroyed by changing
           the limits of Latitude and Longitude defined in the Rules.

           All values for Latitude must lie between -25 and +25,
           inclusive.
           All values for Longitude must lie between -25 and +25,
           inclusive.

           The Total Land Area of Arcadia is the number of existent
           Units of Land defined by permissible Latitude and
           Longitude pairs.


The following Rule is created (Ownership of Land) with a Power of 2:

           Any existent Land for which ownership has not been explicitly
           changed belongs to an entity known as the Land Bureau (the
           Bureau).

           Land belonging to the Bureau is called Unclaimed Land.
           Land belonging to the Bank is called Public Land.
           Land belonging to any other entity is called Private Land.
           A Unit of Land for which a debt exists is considered to be
           In Escrow.

           The Mapkeepor is the Executor of the Land Bureau.
           The Mapkeepor is also a Limited Executor of the Bank,
           with the authority to satisfy debts of Land owed by the
           Bank to its creditors, and the authority to demand the
           payment of Land owed to the Bank by its debtors.

           The transfer of Unclaimed or Public Land to any entity must
           be specifically permitted by the Rules, or be performed by the
           explicit action of an instrument of Power 2 or greater, to be
           an authorized Transfer.

           Private Land may be transferred from its owner to any other
           entity by the owner's Executor.  Any other transfer of Private
           Land must be performed by the explicit Action of an instrument
           of Power 2 or greater to be an authorized transfer.


The following Rule is created (Land Types) with a Power of 2:

            Each Unit of Land shall have a single Land Type.  Each
            Unit of Land that has a Land Type shall have either zero
            or one Land Subtypes.   The Land Type or Subtype of a Unit
            may only be changed as specifically permitted by the Rules,
            or by an instrument of Power 2 or greater.

            The phrase "Units of X", where X is a Land Type (or Subtype)
            defined by the Rules, shall be considered a synonym for
            "Units of Land that have Land Type (or Subtype) X".

            When existent Land has not had its Type changed as explicitly
            permitted by the Rules, or has a Type that is not currently
            defined by the Rules, it shall be considered to have the Land
            Type of Aether.  Rules to the contrary nonwithstanding, Units
            of Aether may not be transferred from the Bureau, or owned by
            any entity other than the Bureau.  If Private or Public Land
            becomes Aether it shall be transferred to the Bureau as soon
            as possible.

            When existent Land has not had its Subtype changed as
            explicitly permitted by the Rules, or has a Subtype that is
            not currently defined by the Rules as permissible for its
            Land Type, it shall be considered to have no Subtype.


The following Rule is created (The Mapkeepor) with a Power of 1:

            There exists the Office of Mapkeepor, whose responsibility is
            to be the recordkeeper for the Land of Arcadia.  The Mapkeepor
            shall produce a Weekly Report including:

                  (a) The Ownership and Land Type of all existent Land;
                  (b) All changes in the Ownership and Land Type of
                      existent Land since the most recent report;
                  (c) The Location of all Entities or Instruments that
                      have a defined Location.


The following Rule is created (Defined Land Types and Subtypes) with a
Power of 1:
            In addition to Aether, the following Land Types
            are defined:
                 (a) Wilderness;
                 (b) Farmland;
                 (c) Water;
                 (d) Urbana.

             The following Land Subtypes are permissible for
             Units of Wilderness:
                 (a) Mountans;
                 (b) Hills;
                 (c) Forest;
                 (d) Desert;

             The following Land Subtypes are permissible for
             Units of Urbana:
                 (a) City;
                 (b) Road;
                 (c) Aqueduct.

The following Rule is created (Land Topology) with a Power of 1:

      Two Units of Land are Adjacent if neither their
      Latitudes nor their Longitudes differ by more than
      one from each other.

      The Penguin Distance between two given Units of Land is the
      minimum number of Single Waddles required to Travel from one
      of the given Units to the other given Unit, where one
      Single Waddle is the Penguin Distance required to Travel from
      one Unit of Land to an Adjacent Unit of Land.

      Of a Land Unit:
         (1) the Land Unit with the same Longitude and a
             Latitude greater by 1 is its Northern Neighbor.
         (2) the Land Unit with the same Longitude and a
             Latitude less by 1 is its Southern Neighbor.
         (3) the Land Unit with the same Latitude and a
             Longitude greater by 1 is its Eastern Neighbor.
         (4) the Land Unit with the same Latitude and a
             Longitude less by 1 is its Western Neighbor.

The following Rule is created (Entity Location) with a Power of 1:

      The following Entities shall each have a single defined
      Location corresponding to a single Latitude, Longitude
      pair within the limits set in the Rules for Latitude and
      Longitude on the Map of Arcadia:
              (a) Every Player;
              (b) Every Organization.
      No other Entity shall have a location unless it is defined
      in other Rules.  The Location of an Entity may not be set
      or changed except as explicitly permitted by the Rules or
      an instrument of Power 1 or greater.  If an Entity is
      specified by this Rule as having
      a defined Location, but its Location has not been explicity
      set or changed, its Location shall be Latitude 0, Longitude 0.


The following Rule is created (Rule Location) with a Power of 1:

      The Rule Mapping is a Rules-defined calculation that maps
      a single integer (a Rule Number as defined elsewhere in the
      Rules) onto a single Latitude, Longitude pair within the limits
      of Latitude and Longitude on the Map of Arcadia.

      The Rule Mapping must be such that no two possible Rule Numbers
      between 101 and the Total Land Area of Arcadia are mapped to the
      same Latitude, Longitude pair.

      For any existent Rule, the Latitude and Longitude pair resulting
      from a Rule Mapping of the Rule's Number is the Rule's Location.
      A Rule's Location only changes if its Rule Number changes or if
      the Rule Mapping contained in this Rule changes.

      The Rule Mapping is defined by the following procedure:
          1.  The number 100 is subtracted from the Rule Number
              to calculate the number of Vulture Steps in the Rule
              Number's Vulture Journey.
          2.  The Latitude and Longitude of the Mapping shall be that
              of the Land Unit Visited when the final Vulture Step of
              the Rule Number's Vulture Journey is taken, where each
              Vulture Step in the Journey is taken as follows:

                (a) If no Vulture Steps have yet been taken in the
                    Journey, by visiting the Land Unit with Latitude 0,
                    Longitude 0; otherwise,
                (b) From the Land Unit most recently visited in the
                    specific Vulture Journey:
                    (i) If neither its Northern, nor Western, nor Southern,
                        nor Eastern Neighbor has been visited in the
                        Journey, by visiting its Eastern Neighbor;
                        otherwise,
                   (ii) If its Nothern, Western, and Southern Neighbors
                        have all been visited, by visiting
                        its Eastern Neighbor; otherwise,
                  (iii) If its Western Neighbor has been visited but
                        its Northern Neighbor has not, by visiting its
                        Northern Neighbor, otherwise;
                   (iv) If the Southern Neighbor has been visited but
                        the Western Neightbor has not, by visiting the
                        Western Neighbor, otherwise;
                    (v) If the Eastern Neighbor has been visited but
                        the Southern Neighbor has not, by visiting the
                        Southern Neighbor, otherwise;
                   (vi) If the Northern Neigbor has been visited but
                        the Eastern Neighbor has not, by visiting the
                        Eastern Neighbor.

[This is just a simple outward spiral]

The following Rule is created (This Landscape, This Ruleset) with a
Power of 1:

       Upon the adoption of this Rule, if a number which maps onto
       the Latitude, Longitude pair of an existent Unit of Land using
       the Rule Mapping, is not an existent Rule Number, the Unit's
       Land Type shall be changed to Aether.

        Otherwise, the Land Type of the Unit of Land at the Latitude,
        Longitude representing each Rule Number's Location:

       (i) shall be changed to Land Type Wilderness if the Rule has
            a Power greater than or equal to 1, but less than 2.

      (ii) shall be changed to Land Type Farmland if the Rule has
            a Power greater than or equal to 2, but less than 3.

     (iii) shall be changed to Land Type Urbana if the Rule has
           a Power of 3 or more.

       If a Rule Change enacts a new Rule, repeals an existing Rule,
       or changes the Power of a Rule, the Land Type at the Rule's
       Location shall be changed as above.  Land Types may still be
       changed by other Rules.


ASAP after this Proposal Passes, the Mapkeepor shall publish
a Map showing all Land Types as set by the Rules enacted by
this Proposal, and indicating a Land Subtype for each
Unit of Land chosen at eir discretion from the allowable
Subtypes.  Upon the publication of this Map, the
Land Subtypes shall be set according to the Map, and thereafter
may only be changed as the Rules allow.

[Proposed Map included later].
