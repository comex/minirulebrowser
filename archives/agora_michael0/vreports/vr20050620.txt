-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 4805 by Goethe, AI=2, Democratic
Card "Contracts" v1.1


Proposal: Card "Contracts" v1.1

Manu is the coauthor of this proto-Proposal.

History
      Card Contracts v1.1
       - Added fix of Card-carrying contracts by Maud
       - Added intenting and bullets by root

      Card Contracts v1.0
       - Some edits as suggested by Maud

      Card Contracts v0.3
       - Card books are no longer Contracts, but their own type of
         document.
       - Therefore, this proto has nothing to do with contracts
         anymore.

       Card Contracts v0.2
       - Makes new Deckmastor Budget concept
       - Makes three contracts of varying power for cards
       - Includes blueprints
       - Cleans a little and upmutates Contract Rules

       Card Contracts v0.1
       - Manu's version


Amend Rule 2068 (The Deckmastor) to read:

      The Deckmastor is an office whose responsibilities include
      shuffling, dealing, and other random actions concerning cards,
      and who acts as the recordkeepor for Cards.  The Deckmastor's
      Weekly Report shall contain a record of all Cards in existence,
      recent card actions, and what entity possesses each Card.

      The Deck and the Discard Pile are Gamblers.  The Deckmastor
      shall be the sole Executor of both entities, but may take no
      action on behalf of them except as explicitly permitted by the
      Rules.  The Deck and Discard Pile may not transfer cards to any
      other entity except as explicitly required by the Rules.

      Only the Deckmastor may create or destroy Cards, and e only may
      do so when the rules require it.  The Deckmastor creates or
      destroys a card by announcement, specifying as appropriate the
      entity who now possesses it or previously possessed it.

      If at any time fewer Copies of a defined Class of Cards exist
      than its Quota, then the Deckmastor shall create a Copy of that
      Card in the possession of The Deck, unless otherwise specified.
      If at any time more Copies of a Class of Cards exist than its
      Quota, then the Deckmastor shall destroy a Copy of that Card in
      the possession of The Deck, unless no such Copies exist, in
      which case the Deckmastor shall destroy a random Copy.


Create the following Rule, entitled "Deckmastor's Budget":

      The Deckmastor shall have a budget containing values for each of
      the following:

      (a) the Maximum Hand Size and the Minimum Hand Size, each of
          which is a positive integer between 2 and 10, with the
          Minimum being less than the Maximum. In the absence of a
          budget, the Maximum Hand Size shall be 5 and the Minimum
          Hand Size shall be 2.

      (b) the Maximum Deck Size, which shall be no less than the
          number of players in the game times the maximum hand size.

      (c) the Maximum Deck Diversity, which shall be no less than
          twice the number of players in the game.

      If the Budget does not specify values for (a-c) above, or
      specifies a value violating these limits, the value shall be the
      smallest value that does not violate these limits.

      The Deckmastor's Budget shall also contain a Quota, which is a
      non-negative integer, for each defined class of Card.  If the
      quota for a particular class of card is not specified in the
      Budget, that card shall have a quota of 0.


The Maximum Deck Size is hereby set to 100.
The Maximum Deck Diversity is hereby set to 30.
All quotas in the budget are hereby set equal to their current values,
either as explicitly defined in the Rules or as already contained in
the Deckmastor's Budget.

Create the following Rule, entitled "Card Constraints"

      The following maxima exist for card frequencies:
          (a) For a card with a unique frequency, one.
          (b) For card with a rare frequency, the number of active
              players.

      If the current quota for a card class exceeds the maximum for
      its defined frequency, then any Player may, with 2 support,
      amend the Deckmastor's budget to set the card's quota to its
      maximum.  When a card's frequency is defined or changed, and the
      mechanism changing it does not specify a new quota, its quota is
      set to the maximum for that frequency.

      If at any time the sum of all quotas for all cards is greater
      than the Maximum Deck Size, the Deckmastor may, with 2 support,
      amend the budget by reducing quotas so that the resulting sum is
      equal to this maximum.

      If at any time the number of card classes with positive quotas
      is greater than the Maximum Deck Diversity, the Deckmastor may,
      with 2 support, amend the budget by setting quotas to 0 so that
      the resulting number of card classes with positive quotas is
      equal to this maximum.


Create the following Rule with a Power of 2, entitled "Card
Definitions" and reading as follows:

      A Cardbook is a document, maintained by the Deckmastor, that is
      specifically defined in the Rules as being a Cardbook.  The
      Deckmastor must publish each cardbook as soon as possible after
      its contents change, and at least once a month.  The contents of
      a cardbook may only be changed as explicitly permitted by the
      Rules.

      The Deckmastor may change non-substantial properties of any
      Cardbook, specifically layout, whitespace, and the order of
      definitions, as e sees fit.

      A class of card is considered defined if and only if a valid
      definition for that card class exists in a cardbook.  A valid
      card definition defines a Class of Card by specifying a Caption,
      a Frequency, zero or more Elements, and zero or more Exploits.

      (a) The Caption shall be the name of a particular Class of
          Cards. No two Classes of Cards shall have the same Caption.

      (b) The Frequency, which may have one of the following values:
          Common, Rare, Unique.  If any other value is specified, the
          frequency shall be considered to be Unique.

      (c) A cardbook may define Elements for Cards. Each Element shall
          have a name and a description. Any Card possessing the
          Element of that name shall behave according to the
          description associated with that Element. An Element not
          defined in a cardbook has no effect.

      (d) An Exploit is an action that the Holder of that Card (and
          only the Holder of that Card) may take if and only if e
          clearly indicates the card whose Exploit e is performing and
          e meets the requirements and/or pays the costs outlined in
          that Exploit. Any reference to "you," "your" or a similar
          pronoun in the text of an Exploit refers to the Holder of
          that Card. Taking an action described in an Exploit is known
          as Playing the Card. Unless a Rule or card definition says
          otherwise, a Card is automatically transferred to the
          Discard Pile immediately after being Played.

      All Cards of the same Class shall be identical and fungible.
      Each individual instance of a Card shall be considered to be a
      Copy of that Class of Card.

      If there are conflicts between a card or element definition in a
      cardbook and the Rules, then the conflict shall be resolved as
      if the definition were contained in the text of the Rule that
      defines the particular cardbook.

      This Rule has precedence over any Rule describing the definition
      or interpretation of card classes and card elements.


Create the following Rule with a Power of 2, entitled "Cards of Power"
and containing the following text:

      There is a cardbook called the Twopower Cardbook, which may only
      be changed by a Proposal with a power of 2 or greater.

      If the definitions contained within the Twopower Cardbook would
      set, under certain conditions, the power of a copy of a card
      defined in it, then this Rule is considered to be the entity
      that sets the power of that card copy.


Create the following Rule, entitled "Onepower Cardbook", and
containing the following text:

      There is a cardbook called the Onepower Cardbook, which may only
      be changed by Proposal.


Amend Rule 2104 (Contreras Card Labs) to read:

      The University encourages Card experimentation.

      There is a cardbook called the Blueprints Cardbook, which may be
      changed by Proposal, or as specified in this Rule.

      Any Player may, with support, add a Blueprint to the Blueprints
      cardbook.  A Blueprint must be a valid card definition.

      Any card added in this manner shall have a quota of 0.

      Any Player may, with support, remove a Blueprint with a quota of
      0 from the Blueprints cardbook.

      If a Blueprint has been in the Blueprints Cardbook for over four
      days, any Player may change the quota of that Blueprint from 0
      to 1 (if the card is unique) or from 0 to a number not greater
      than the number of active Players (if the card is rare or
      common), without three Objections.

      If the quota of a card is changed in this manner, the Deckmastor
      shall create one of the copies of that card in The Library
      rather than in the Deck.


=====================

The Twopower Cardbook consists of the following text:

   The following Elements for Cards are defined:

      * Powered [X], where X is a positive integer: This Card has its
        Power set to X for exactly the duration of its play.  To
        Activate any Exploit possessed by this Card, a Fee of X - 1
        must be paid in addition to any other Fees required to
        Activate that Exploit, unless that Exploit explicitly
        specifies otherwise.

=====================

The Onepower Cardbook consists of the following text:


   The following Elements for Cards are defined:

      * Grafty: If a card is Grafty, then it is Budgeted, with its
        initial quota set equal to one plus the number of Players who
        voted FOR the Proposal that first defined that class of card
        as Grafty.  When the Deckmastor initially creates cards to
        fulfil this quota, e shall first destroy all existing copies
        of the card, then create one copy in the possession of the
        Deck, and finally create one copy in the possession of each
        Player who voted FOR said proposal.

      * Handed [X], where X is a non-negative integer: When
        calculating Hand Size, this Card counts as X Cards.

      * Restricted [X], where X is a type of entity: Only entities
        considered to be an X may Activate any Exploit possessed by
        the Card.

      * Limited [X] [Y], where X is a type of entity and Y is a
        positive integer: For an entity not considered to be an X to
        Activate any Exploit possessed by the Card requires em to pay
        a Fee of Y.

      * Persistent: Playing this Card does not result in its being
        transferred to The Deck.

      * Delayed[N]: You may not play this card if you have played a
        copy of this card in the past N times 24 hours.

      * Asleep[N]: No one may play a copy of this card if anyone has

================
The Blueprints Cardbook consists of the following text:

   The following Elements for Cards are defined:


   The following classes of Cards are defined:


================


Amend Rule 2069 (Card Definitions) by deleting the following text:
      II. Definitions

      The Rules may define a Class of Card by specifying a Caption, a
      Quota, zero or more Elements, and zero or more Exploits. All
      Cards of the same Class shall be identical and fungible. Each
      individual instance of a Card shall be considered to be a Copy
      of that Class of Card.

      (a) The Caption shall be the name of a particular Class of
          Cards. No two Classes of Cards shall have the same Caption.

      (b) The Quota shall be a non-negative integer. If at any time
          fewer Copies of a Class of Cards exist than its Quota, then
          the Deckmastor shall create a Copy of that Card in the
          possession of The Deck. If at any time more Copies of a
          Class of Cards exist than its Quota, then the Deckmastor
          shall destroy a Copy of that Card in the possession of The
          Deck, unless no such Copies exist, in which case the
          Deckmastor shall destroy a random Copy.

      (c) The Rules may define Elements for Cards. Each Element shall
          have a name and a description. Any Card possessing the
          Element of that name shall behave according to the
          description associated with that Element. An Element not
          defined in the Rules has no effect.

      (d) An Exploit is an action that the Holder of that Card (and
          only the Holder of that Card) may take if and only if e
          clearly indicates the card whose Exploit e is performing and
          e meets the requirements and/or pays the costs outlined in
          that Exploit. Any reference to "you," "your" or a similar
          pronoun in the text of an Exploit refers to the Holder of
          that Card. Taking an action described in an Exploit is known
          as Playing the Card. Unless a Rule says otherwise, a Card is
          automatically transferred to the Discard Pile immediately
          after being Played.

and by replacing the text:
      III. Actions
with:
      II. Actions

and by renaming the Rule to "Card Actions".


Amend R1932 to read:

      All cards with the Element "Shares [X]" are cumulatively known
      as the Stock Cards.

      An entity's Share Holdings is equal to the number of Shares
      possessed. The Number of Shares is the sum of the Share Holdings
      of all entities.

      A Shareholder is an Eligible Shareholder with positive Share
      Holdings. A Plebeian is a Player who is not a Shareholder. The
      Corporation is the set of all Shareholders.


Amend Rule 2101 (The New Raffle) to read:

      As soon as possible after the 13th day of the third month of
      each quarter, the Deckmastor shall randomly select a copy of a
      Raffle Ticket in the possession of a Player and announce eir
      selection, unless no such copy exists.  Upon this announcement,
      the Player in possession gains three instances of the ephemeral
      Patent Title "Fortune's Fool", and each Raffle Ticket in the
      possession of a Player is automatically discarded.


Amend rule 2097 (Card-Carrying Contests) to read:

      A Contract may be made into a Card-Carrying Contract by its
      Notary acting with two support and without two objections.  A
      player may only be Notary of one Card-Carrying Contract at a
      time.

      A Card-Carrying Contract is a gambler, and may perform the
      following actions only as explicitly permitted by its
      regulations:

      1.  As long as the Contract has at least three Members and its
          hand size is less than the maximum hand size, it may draw a
          number of cards each month equal to its number of Members at
          the beginning of the month divided by two and rounded up.

      2.  Transfer or discard cards.

      A Card-Carrying Contract may not play cards.


Amend rule 2096 (Card-Carrying Contracts) to read:

      If an ephemeral patent title is earned between one week before
      the end of the previous quarter and one week before the end of
      the current quarter, then it must be awarded before the turning
      of a new parchment.

      The announcement that a proposal does not earn the proposer the
      boon of tapecutter must also follow these time restrictions.

Change the title of rule 2096 to "Ephemeral Time Limits".
Change the title of rule 2097 to "Card-Carrying Contracts".
