ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Enough Already!" by Elysion - Proposal 4093 adopted 12/24
  Repeal Rules 1949 and 1943, both of which have long since had their one-time
    effects.

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Adjust Elections" by Murphy
  Terms of Service expire on the 15th of the month, not the 1st.
  Elections must be initiated as soon as possible after an Office comes to be
    without an Electee.

"Banking Developments" by t
  Rule 1470 "The Bank" is simplified and absorbs Rule 1927 "Bank Currency
    Creation".

"Clarify Resignation with Successor" by Murphy
  A successor must consent within one week of being named, and eir consent has
    no effect if the Office acquires an Electee in the meantime.

"Compensate for Complacent Oligarchy" by Murphy
  If an Ordinary Proposal fails Quorum, then it becomes Democratic and goes
    through another week of Voting.

"Damn Those Yankees!" by Blob
  Several forms of "authorize", "penalize", "apologize", "recognize", and
    "organize" are replaced with their British spellings.

"Easier Scoring" by Murphy
  Announcements of changes in Points need not identify the Rule authorizing
    them.  (The only such Rule is Rule 1930.)

"Fix Announcement of Referendum Results" by Murphy
  Referendum results must be announced by Vote Collector.
  One-week challenge clause is copied from Elections to Referenda generally.
  Fix a typo in Rule 1445 (Defaults for Elections).

"Fix Speaker Making Proposals Democratic" by Murphy
  Rule 1934 (The Speaker and Democratic Proposals) does not make Proposals
    Democratic directly, but allows the Speaker to make them Democratic.  Rule
    1933 (Ordinary and Democratic Proposals) is amended to recognize this,
    hence allowing Rule 1934 to work as intended.

"More Ways to Win" by Murphy
  Not being Immaculate is a Win-Preventing Condition.
  Being the only Immaculate Player is a Win Condition.  Upon such a Win, the
    Herald shall expunge N Blots per Player, where N is just enough to make at
    least one other Player Immaculate.
  An Insane Proposal distributed but receiving no FOR Votes is a Win Condition.

"Oerjan's Fix Roles" by Elysion
  Organizations may transfer Stems to Players, but only within seven days after
    obtaining them.
  The Bank owes 241 Stems to lee, 114 Stems to the Agoran Carnival, and 37
    Stems to the Order of the Evil Eye.  These debts compensate those entities
    for debts in VTs, P-Notes, or IATs, which were not previously converted to
    Stems.
  Rule 1936 (Auctioning Positions in the Oligarchy) has the typo "On
    Politicians" replaced by "Only Politicians".

"Pay Your Debts" by t
  Penalty for Persistent Indebtedness is stated using the Class N notation.

"Revised Claims of Error" by Murphy
  Any message to the Public Forum may be subject to a Claim of Error, but the
    author is not required to respond unless e was required by the Rules to
    publish the text in question.

"Scores" by t
  Winning a contested Election is worth 15 Points, not 10.  Losing a contested
    Election is worth 7 Points if you receive at least many Votes as there were
    Candidates.  However, for the purpose of both of these awards, Candidates
    receiving no Votes are omitted.
  No penalty from resigning from an Office.
  Adoption of one's Proposal is worth 9 Points minimum, plus 29 if you have
    never had a Proposal adopted before.
  1 Point for a Proposal that attains Quorum but receives exactly X times as
    many FOR as AGAINST Votes, where X is the Proposal's Adoption Index.
  Being the only Player to Vote FOR or AGAINST a Proposal is worth 4 Points,
    not 10.

"Spelling Fixes, Part 1 of 2" by Murphy
  Fix typos in the following Rules:
  Rule 1926 (The Official Secrets Act)
  Rule 1727 (Happy Birthday)
  Rule 1948 (Zombie Transfer Tax)
  Rule 1789 (Cantus Cygneus)
  Rule 1755 (No Non-Player Responsibilities)
  Rule 1431 (Claims of Error)
  Rule 1764 (Modes of Voting)
  Rule 1434 (Default Procedure for Referendum Voting)
  Rule 1810 (Noncompliance with Orders)
  Rule 1812 (Notices of Infraction)
  Rule 1369 (Theses)
  Rule 1370 (How to Get a Degree)
  Rule 1579 (Mintors)
  Rule 1917 (General Currency Taxation)
  Rule 1598 (Property Transfers)
  Rule 1887 (Default Procedure for Auctions)
  Rule 1924 (Living Twice Shall Have Its Price)
  Rule 1446 (Contests)

"Spelling Fixes, Part 2 of 2" by Murphy
  Fix spelling errors in Rules 1664 (Rebellion) and 1937 (Filling Vacancies in
    the Oligarchy).

"The Dole" by Murphy
  Players may go On The Dole, forfeiting eir Minimum Income to automatically
    expunge a Blot per month.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Criminal Simplification" by Murphy
  Rule 1503 (Crimes and Infractions) is simplified and absorbs Rule 1815
    (Crimes and Infractions without Penalties).
  Infractions are penalized via Orders.
  Upon admitting a Claim of Error that an Infraction was not committed, the
    Player who annnounced the Infraction shall vacate all Orders e executed to
    impose the penalty.  [This depends on the adoption of "Revised Claims of
    Error" to allow a non-Rule-required document to be subject to a COE.]

"Judicial Simplification, Part 1 of 2" by Murphy
  Rule 991 (Invoking Judgement) is simplified and absorbs Rule 1563 (Statement
    of a CFJ).
  Submitting a CFJ to the Justiciar is broadened.
  Barring Players with same Executor as Caller is broadened, e.g. to account
    for a Player with Power of Attorney over two other Players.
  Rule 1868 (Selecting a Judge) is simplified.
  Rule 698 (Always an Eligible Judge) is simplified.
  Rule 1756 (Delinquent Judges) is repealed, leaving Rule 408 (Late Judgement)
    to penalize Judges for failing to Judge on time.
  Rule 408 (Late Judgement) is simplified by defining the Overtime Period.
  DISMISSED is a Judgement.
  Evidentiary standard for Rule violations or Crimes is improved, e.g. to
    account for a CFJ "Joe has not committed the Crime of Perjury" being
    Judged FALSE.
  Reasons a CFJ should be dismissed are simplified.
  Salary for Judges, and forfeiture of Salary when one's Judgement is
    overturned, is centralized in Rule 502 (Salary for Judges).
  Rule 1693 (Appeal of a Judgement) absorbs Rule 1694 (Appeal of a Dismissal).
  Rule 908 (Formal Apologies) absorbs Rule 1832 (Failure to Apologize).

CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1251  "Kelly has failed to select a Judge for the CFJ called by Peekee on
Dismissed  November 11, and Kelly is not the CotC."
          12/15     Called by Elysion; attempted to file with Justiciar, but
                      maybe unsuccessful because Kelly was not CotC (see CFJ
                      1256) and thus Rule 1831 could not be triggered
          12/17     Justiciar Steve assigns to Blob, who dismisses the CFJ
          12/24-27  CotC Murphy assigns to Blob, who dismisses the CFJ
          Judge's argument (summary):  Peekee did not call a CFJ on November 11
            (e called one on November 7).

CFJ 1252  "Peekee has a Will."
          11/7  Called by Peekee
          Caller's argument (summary):  Peekee had a Will when Wills last
            ceased to be defined by the Rules.  Now Wills are once again
            defined by the Rules.  Is "Peekee's Will" still an entity?  If so,
            is it once again a Will?

CFJ 1253  "Novalis and Harlequin are not Zombies."
          11/16  Called by Andre
          Caller's argument (summary):  The Zombies have sent messages to the
            Public Forum (e.g. to Vote), which makes them cease to be Zombies.
          Counterargument (summary):  The PF messages are sent by the Zombies'
            Executors, not the Zombies themselves.

CFJ 1254  "Peekee possesses at least one Voting Token."
          11/20  Called by Murphy
          Caller's argument (summary):  Murphy attempted to create a Voting
            Token and transfer it to Peekee.
          Counterargument (summary):  Even if the creation succeeded, the
            Voting Token cannot be possessed or transferred, because the Rules
            do not explicitly define it as being Property.

CFJ 1255  "Rule 1586 should be interpreted such that the Rule created by
           Proposal 4090 (Debt Conversion) has no effect, since any
           outstanding debts and liabilities in Basic Currencies were
           canceled when Basic Currencies were abolished from the Rules."
          12/8  Called by Oerjan
          Counterargument (summary):  Only the Currencies themselves were
            abolished; debts referring to those Currencies continued to exist.

CFJ 1256  "Peekee submitted at least one CFJ to the Clerk of the Courts
[TRUE]     during November 2000; the Clerk of the Courts has not assigned
           a Judge to any such CFJ; and Kelly is not the Clerk of the Courts."
          12/18     Called by Murphy; filed with Justiciar
          12/18-19  Assigned to Wes, who Judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  First and second clauses are simple
            fact, included to allow filing with the Justiciar.  Third clause
            depends on whether the Referendum to Impeach Kelly as CotC was
            successful.  Its success was announced, first by Andre (who had
            previously deregistered and thus ceased to be Vote Collector), then
            by Speaker Murphy (in case Rule 1434 made em Vote Collector).
          Judge's argument (summary):  All Votes were received by Andre before
            e deregistered, and Rule 1434 does not require the announcement of
            results to come from the Vote Collector, so Andre's announcement
            was effective even though e was no longer Vote Collector.

CFJ 1257  "Peekee is an Oligarch."
          12/18  Called by Murphy
          Caller's argument (summary):  While Peekee paid eir bid late, e still
            paid it, and thus became an Oligarch.

CFJ 1258  "Peekee is the Notary."
          12/18  Called by Murphy
          Caller's argument (summary):  Notary ceased to be an Office on 5/8,
            at which time Blob held it.  Had it remained an Office, a
            subsequent Election would have transferred it to Peekee.  Can that
            alleged Election be interpreted as effective anyway?

ERRATA
------

It appears that the only Proposal subject to the broken Rule 1934 (The Speaker
  and Democratic Proposals) was Proposal 4010, which would have failed Quorum
  whether or not Rule 1934 were working correctly.
