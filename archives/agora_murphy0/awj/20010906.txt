"Land Auctions and Tolls" by neil - Proposal 4210
  While less than half the Land in Arcadia is Player-owned, the Mapkeepor shall
    Auction 10 units of non-Aether Land each month (or all of them, if there
    are less than 10).  This is a Vickrey Auction, with Bids in Indulgences.
  A Player may pay 0.2 Indulgences to add a Toll to a unit of eir Land.  The
    amount of the Toll is specified by the Player; it is in exactly one of
    (VEs, Indulgences, Papyri) and is at most 200 times the MUQ.  Any other
    Player who moves there owes this Toll to the owner.
  The Mapkeepor commits the Class 3 Crime of Conspiracy to Commit Highway
    Robbery if e incorrectly confirms a Toll, or the Class 3 Crime of Not
    Feeding the Toll Under the Bridge if e incorrectly denies a Toll.
  A Player may remove a Toll from a unit of eir Land, and eir Toll is

"Make The CotC's Life Easier" by Taral

  Zombies are repealed.
  Silence causes deregistration.
  Zombie Auctions are replaced by Auctioning the right to Loot the Corpse of
    the Dissolute.  The winner (if any) has one week to do so (and may loot
    Stems); any remaining Property shall be transferred to the Bank.

"Upholding the Law" by neil - Proposal 4209 (opposite of Proposal 4206)

PROTO-PROPOSALS

CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1316  "Zombies may not be Players."
[TRUE]    8/16     Called by neil
Appealed  8/16     Assigned to root, who Judges TRUE
          8/22-23  Appealed by Murphy, Steve, root, and Crito
          8/26     Appeal assigned to Taral, Peekee, and Murphy
          Caller's argument (summary):  Players have duties (obeying the Rules,
            from Rule 101) and so Rule 1755 prevents a Zombie from being one.
            While Rule 1042 states that Silent Players become Zombies, it does
            not state that they remain Players afterward.  Zombies are
            Property, Players are individuals, international law prohibits
            slavery, and it is in the best interest of the game not to violate
            international law.
          Counterargument:  Rules 1976, 1885, 1886, 1755 itself, 1992, 1555,
            1963, 1936, and 559 all clearly intend that Zombies remain Players,
            and cease being Zombies if they cease being Players.  Rule 1042
            explicitly contains the clause "the Zombie is a Player", though it
            is embedded within another clause.  "Property" does not have its
            natural language meaning in Agora, and Zombies may escape their
            Property-ness at any time by becoming Noisy, so anti-slavery law
            does not apply.
