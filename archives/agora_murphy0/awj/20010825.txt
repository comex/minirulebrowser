CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1314  "Peekee is an Active Player."
[TRUE]    8/15     Called by Peekee
          8/15-19  Assigned to pTang, who Judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Peekee sent a message to the Public
            Forum, attempting to come Off Hold, but eir message was initially
            rejected because e was not subscribed.
          Counterargument:  Peekee's message is not an announcement until it is
            sent *via* the PF, not just *to* the PF (Rule 478).  Peekee's
            message was eventually sent via the PF, but only by being quoted
            as evidence for this CFJ, so the statement was false at the time of
            calling.

CFJ 1315  "In publishing with the Voting Report for Proposals 4184-4194
[TRUE]     incorrect text for Proposal 4190, Blob committed the Class 4 Crime
           of Misrepresentation."
          8/16     Called by neil
          8/16-18  Assigned to Elysion, who Judges TRUE

CFJ 1316  "Zombies may not be Players."
[TRUE]    8/16     Called by neil
          8/16     Assigned to root, who Judges TRUE
          8/22-23  Appealed by Murphy, Steve, root, and Crito
          Caller's argument (summary):  Players have duties (obeying the Rules,
            from Rule 101) and so Rule 1755 prevents a Zombie from being one.
            While Rule 1042 states that Silent Players become Zombies, it does
            not state that they remain Players afterward.  Zombies are
            Property, Players are individuals, international law prohibits
            slavery, and it is in the best interest of the game not to violate
            international law.
          Counterargument:  Rules 1976, 1885, 1886, 1755 itself, 1992, 1555,
            1963, 1936, and 559 all clearly intend that Zombies remain Players,
            and cease being Zombies if they cease being Players.  Rule 1042
            explicitly contains the clause "the Zombie is a Player", though it
            is embedded within another clause.  "Property" does not have its
            natural language meaning in Agora, and Zombies may escape their
            Property-ness at any time by becoming Noisy, so anti-slavery law
            does not apply.

CFJ 1317  "A Zombie cannot own another Zombie."
[FALSE]   8/16     Called by root
          8/16-24  Assigned to Syllepsis, who Judges FALSE
