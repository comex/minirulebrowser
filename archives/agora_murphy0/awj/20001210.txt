------------------

"Away With the Chaff Already" by Elysion - Proposal 4088 failed quorum 12/6

    which have already served their purposes.

  Fix a typo in Rule 1936 (Auctioning Positions in the Oligarchy:  "On
    Politicians") introduced by "Playing Roles".

  Rule 1016 (Putting Oneself On Hold) is simplified.

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Enough Already!" by Elysion
  Repeal Rules 1949 (Continuity of Debt) and 1943 (Continuity of the Bank),
    which have already served their purposes.

"Fix Rule 1868" by Elysion
  The Clerk of the Courts must select and announce a Judge under a single ASAP
    requirement, rather than two separate and successive requirements.

"Rebellion Reform" by Elysion - Proposal 4091
  All numbers used in determining the success of a Revolt, as well as the
    Indulgence tax following a success, are determined at the time of the Call
    for Revolt.
  A successful Revolt cancels any Indulgence Auction in progress.
  Unique Patent Title of Pugachev awarded to caller of a failed Revolt.
  Rule 1840 (Inciting to Riot) is renamed "Political Status", the new term for
    whether a Player is Abiding or Rebellious.  The method of determining a
    Player's Political Status is moved here from Rule 1664 (Rebellion).  Rule
    1840 also has its Power increased from 1 to 2.
  If a Revolt in the previous month remains unresolved, the Registrar must
    resolve it before reporting Infractions of Inciting to Riot.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Bluff Auctions" by Blob
  The Dealer is the Recordkeepor of Cards, which are Property corresponding to
    the 52 standard poker cards.
  Ownership of Cards is Secret.  The Dealer's Report includes only the number
    of Cards owned by each entity.
  The Dealer is the Executor of the Deck and the Pile, each of which may own
    Cards but no other Property.  The Pile's Cards shall be transferred to the
    Deck whenever there is no Bluff Auction in progress.
  A Player may buy a random Card from the Deck for 10 Stems.
  A Player may call for a redeal of Cards, Without Objection from Players with
    at least four Cards.  This returns all Cards to the Deck, then gives each
    entity a number of random Cards equal to what it possessed before.
  Hands are defined, according to standard poker rules.  Aces may be high or
    low, but not both within a single Hand.  A Hand is five Cards or less.
  The Dealer is the Auctioneer of all Bluff Auctions, and cannot Bid.
  A Player becomes a Bidder by transferring one or more Hands to the Pile; this
    information is Secret during the Auction.
  A Bidder may submit one Bid (at most 20 times the Auction Currency's MUQ) per
    Hand e submitted.
  A Bidder may raise a winning Bid (by at most 20 times the Auction Currency's
    MUQ) if it is not already one of the N highest Bids, where N is the number
    of items being Auctioned.
  A Bidder may cancel a Bid before the Auction ends, in which case e gets the
    corresponding Hand back.
  At the end of the Auction, the highest Bids win; ties are broken by highest
    Hand.  All non-winning Bids (including cancelled) become debts to the Bank.
  Papyri are Auctioned using Bluff Auctions.

"Fix Inciting to Riot" by Elysion
  If a Revolt in the previous month is determined to succeed during this month,
    then Players continuously Rebellious from Call to success are not guilty of
    Inciting to Riot.

"Fix Roles II" by Oerjan
  Peekee's Oligarch bid is amended from 1 VT to 1 Stem.
  Organizations are reimbursed in Stems for eir previous Basic Currency
    holdings.
  Organizations may transfer their Stems to Players, but only within seven days
    of obtaining them.
  Fix a typo in Rule 1936 (Auctioning Positions in the Oligarchy:  "On
    Politicians") introduced by "Playing Roles".

CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ ????  "Peekee has a Will."
          11/??  Called by Peekee
          Caller's argument (summary):  Peekee had a Will when Wills last
            ceased to be defined by the Rules.  Now Wills are once again
            defined by the Rules.  Is "Peekee's Will" still an entity?  If so,
            is it once again a Will?

CFJ ????  "Novalis and Harlequin are not Zombies."
          11/16  Called by Andre
          Caller's argument (summary):  The Zombies have sent messages to the
            Public Forum (e.g. to Vote), which makes them cease to be Zombies.
          Counterargument (summary):  The PF messages are sent by the Zombies'
            Executors, not the Zombies themselves.

CFJ ????  "Peekee possesses at least one Voting Token."
          11/20  Called by Murphy
          Caller's argument (summary):  Murphy attempted to create a Voting
            Token and transfer it to Peekee.
          Counterargument (summary):  Even if the creation succeeded, the
            Voting Token cannot be possessed or transferred, because the Rules
            do not explicitly define it as being Property.

CFJ ????  "Rule 1586 should be interpreted such that the Rule created by
           Proposal 4090 (Debt Conversion) has no effect, since any
           outstanding debts and liabilities in Basic Currencies were
           canceled when Basic Currencies were abolished from the Rules."
          12/8  Called by Oerjan
          Counterargument (summary):  Only the Currencies themselves were
            abolished; debts referring to those Currencies continued to exist.
