     Saturday, January 24, 2004


YOU SAY YOU WANT A REVOLUTION...
--------------------------------

Andre    - Stare Decisis      www.win.tue.nl/~engels/stare.txt
Michael  - First Speaker     
www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/mn200/games/nomic/yoyo/
Murphy   - CotC Web           zenith.homelinux.net/cotc/
root     - Proposal Pool      www.cs.earlham.edu/~kellyia/agora/pool.php
t        - AWJ Archive        www.iki.fi/scurra/agora.html


ERRATA
------

Eris's nomination for Speaker-Elect on October 6 was prohibited by Rule
1647,
  so root remained Speaker-Elect until January 16.


ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Legality of Santa Clauses" by Magu - Proposal 4548 adopted 1/13
  After the end of the Christmas holiday, each Naughty player (Blots >=
1)
    gets a Lump of Coal (Albatross), and each Nice player (Blots < 1)
gets a
    Shiny New Toy (Boon).

"Liven Up Team Names" by Sherlock - Proposal 4547 adopted 1/13
  The Scorekeepor may rename Teams while announcing a Win.

"Nondescript Proposal" by OscarMeyr - Contested Proposal 4543 adopted
12/15

"Team Captains" by OscarMeyr - Proposal 4544 adopted 12/15
  Leadership is a team switch with values null, (the team's members).
  If a team's Leadership is null, any member may flip it Without
Teammate
    Objection.
  If a team's Leadership is not null, the Team Captain (and Executor of
the
    team) may flip it at will; any other member may flip it With N
Supporters,
    where N+1 is a majority of the team's members.
  If the Team Captain leaves a team, its Leadership becomes null.

"The Points of Champions" by Goethe - Proposal 4546 failed quorum 1/13 -
     Complacent Oligarchy - Proposal 4550 adopted 1/24
  Points Contests are repealed.
  If there is no Champion's Contest, the Scorekeepor or Speaker may
(With 2
    Support) name one.
  The Contestmaster ceases to be a team member.  If e ceases to be
    Contestmaster of a Champion's Contest, e is assigned to a team as if
e
    were a new player.
  The Champion's Contest begins with zero awardable points.  This is
increased
    monthly by the Champion's Grant, part of the Scorekeepor's Budget,
    initially 60.
  The Champion's Contest may award its awardable points, according to
its SLC.
  When a Team Win occurs, the Champion's Contest ceases to be a
Champion's
    Contest (and loses all awardable points).

"Yappy Hew Near" by Magu - Contested Proposal 4549 adopted 1/13

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

"Power must be an integer" by Magu - Proposal 4545 rejected 1/13
  Rule 594 (Power and Proposals) has its Power increased from 3 to pi. 
Other
    rules must have integer Power; non-integer Powers are rounded down
(and
    rules that would thus receive Power < 1 are instead repealed).

"Sweeping it under the rug" by Murphy - Proposal 4551 rejected 1/24
  The gamestate becomes what it would have been if Steve's Voting Power
on
    Democratic Proposals were 2 through October and November 2003. 
(Proposals
    4532, 4533, 4534, 4540, and 4542 would have properly been adopted,
    regardless of what combination of Steve's attempted votes were valid
or
    invalid, but they have not taken effect because the Assessor
mis-reported
    Steve's pairs-of-votes as valid.)

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Make Monasteries More Meaningful" by Magu
  Each Monastery may declare some or all of their members to be Monks.
  Each Monastery's charter may define up to one Unique Patent Title, one
    Boon, and one Albatross (not Rule-defined or Borne), and award each
of
    them once a month.
  Each player may join at most one Monastery.

"Note the Captains" by Goethe
  The Patent Title of Admiral is awarded to the Captains of Winning
Teams.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Courtrooms" by Goethe
  Courtroom is a CFJ switch with values Criminal (alleging that an
entity has
    committed a Crime or Infraction), Civil (alleging that an entity has
    committed a Civil Breach), and Advisory (everything else).

"Estates" by Magu
  Each of the three Estates (simple majorities of all Politicians, all
    Scribes, and all Acolytes) has a Voting Power of 1 on both Ordinary
and
    Democratic Proposals (and count toward quorum on Ordinary
Proposals).

"Judicial Separation" by Murphy
  A nominee for Clerk of the Courts may not be nominated for Justiciar.
  Neither the Speaker, the Justiciar, nor a nominee for Justiciar may be
    nominated for Clerk of the Courts.
  The Clerk of the Courts and Justiciar may be nominated for
Speaker-Elect.

"Role With the Changes" by Sherlock
  New Roles of Patron and Shamus are created.
  Snitching is a progressive action for Shamuses.  The Shamus must
report
    an unreported Crime or Infraction that the target has committed; e
takes
    one Kudo from the target, but the target is immune to further
penalty.
  Donating is a progressive action for Patrons.  The target Team gains 3
    points.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

*** Rule 1567 causes ineligibility by request to expire after one month
***

1/4   root makes emself ineligible to judge any CFJ assigned between
January
        5 and January 11.

1/5   OscarMeyr makes emself ineligible to judge CFJ 1480.

CFJ 1480  "A Speaker Transition did *not* commence on January 1."
[FALSE]   1/5  Called by Goethe
          1/5  Assigned to Murphy, who judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  The quarterly Speaker Transition
is
            timed based on the start of the quarter, so it is postponed
due to
            the Christmas holiday.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Holidays only postpone future
events
            timed based on past events, but the events in question here
are
            simultaneous.
