          [following INPs do not exist if Uri Bruck is Moderator]
          360 - Agora will vote FOR
          361 - [New Rishonnomic]
                  Amend the text of rule 215 to replace the string "New

OTHER
-----

1/26  Jester creates a Currency named "Jester's Ode Favores".

1/27  Sherlock designates emself the Silly Person.

1/29  Sherlock designates Jester the next Silly Person.

1/30  General Chaos and Oerjan transfer 100 and 36 VTs, respectively,
        to the Bank.  Per Rule 1754 (and Rule 1763), they will get
        these VTs back, despite the adoption of Proposal 3674.

      Sherlock attempts to declare a Paradox:  All VTs were destroyed
        by Proposal 3674, but the Bank is required to transfer VTs to
        the Players.  This doesn't work, for several reasons:
          * Agora has no "Win by Paradox" Rule.
          * The Bank is still able to Mint new VTs.
          * Rules 114 and 1698 prevent Gamestate changes that would
              crash the Game from occurring.

2/1   Read the Ruleset Week begins.
