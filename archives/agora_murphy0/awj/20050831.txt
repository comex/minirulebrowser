ERRATA

ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Card Fixins" by root - Proposal 4834 adopted 8/6
  Site Gamblers are generalized, including the Deck, Discard Pile, Library,
    and now the Table.
  Cards are transferred to the Table while they take effect, discarded
    afterward (unless Persistent).
  Indications, Impositions, and Feats are explicitly defined as components
    of card exploits.  Individual cards may override their default mechanisms.

"Condense ratification" by Maud - Proposal 4832 adopted 8/6
  Merge ratification into a single rule, simplify "not subject to COE/CFJ"
    to "not in dispute", and allow non-required documents to be ratified.

"Tension makes a tangle" by Maud - Proposal 4833 adopted 8/6
  Regulated activities (which Rule 101, renamed "Agora May I?", allows players
    to perform only as specified) are activities that are prohibited, are
    allowed if a condition holds, would modify records required to be kept,
    would break Agora's Nomic-ness, or have been judicially declared as
    regulated.
  Repeal the leftover mention of the Initial Ruleset.
  Players may not be required to do what they are not empowered to do, and
    failing to do such actions is still never a crime or infraction.
  A set of events in a message with ambiguous order and thus effect may be
    invalidated without invalidating other events in the same message with
    unambiguous order and effect.
  Merge the rules for registration and deregistration.
  Simplify the language of Rule 478 (Fora).

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

"Rulebooks" by Maud - Proposal 4831 rejected 8/6
  Rulebooks may define terms, enable, require, and regulate their own
    amendment, but cannot affect amendment of the Rules.
  Rulebooks have default Power 1, and (if non-blank) their maintainers shall
     publish them monthly and ASAP after changes.
  The Codex is a Rulebook with Power 3:
    The Speaker may appoint a player as Rules Lawyer by announcement.
    List of Rulebooks.  The Codex is maintained by the Rules Lawyer.

"The Random Repeal" by Maud - Proposal 4830 rejected 8/6
  Repeal Rule 1079 (Definition of "Random").

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Fix Power" by Maud
  An instrument may modify an entity's power to an amount that does not
    exceed the instrument's power either before or after modification.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

Requests for ineligibility:

<none>

CFJ 1278  "The Assessor has announced the results of the voting on Proposal
[TRUE]     4111."
          2/21/01         Called by Murphy
          2/26/01-3/8/01  Assigned to Syllepsis, who Judges TRUE
          8/10/05         Goethe motions the now-deregistered Syllepsis to
                            consider a spurious argument ("Basset Hounds
                            have Long Ears"); see CFJ 1575
          8/26/05         Motion assigned to root
          Caller's argument (summary):  The Assessor's announcement specified
            the Vote count correctly, but specified the result of that Vote
            count (adoption or rejection) incorrectly.
          Judge's argument (summary):  Later in the message, the Assessor
            specified the result of the Vote count correctly.

CFJ 1453  "As a result of the formation of root's Pay Out Scam Contest (rPOSC),
[TRUE]     the Bank incurred a debt to root consisting of one or more
            properties."
           3/4/03    Called by root
           3/10-17   Assigned to t, who makes emself ineligible
           3/20-24   Assigned to Sir Toby, who Judges TRUE
           6/16/05   Appealed by root, Maud, and Goethe
           6/19-7/4  Appeal assigned to Murphy, Maud, and Michael, who are
                       recused
           7/8       Appeal assigned to Riail, Manu, and OscarMeyr
           7/22      OscarMeyr moves to SUSTAIN
           7/28      Manu moves to SUSTAIN
           8/29      Riail recused
           8/7-11    Appeal assigned to Eris, who moves to REASSIGN
           Caller's argument (summary):  The Contest required root to pay out
             Property to emself, and Rule 1594 (Violation of SLCs) requires em
             to obey the Regulations.  Since Rule 1594 requires em to pay out
             Property, Rule 1479 (Definition of "Pay Out" and "Bill") causes
             the Bank to incur a debt.
           Judge's argument (summary):  This is backed up by game custom that
             Orders requiring paying-out create debts because they are also
             backed by Rule 1594.
           Counterargument (summary):  SLCs and similar entities do not
             empower in the same way that they restrict.  This appeal will
             provide an analogy for Cardbooks, Contracts, and Agreements.

CFJ 1574  "All Cards currently defined in the Onepower Cardbook that change
[FALSE]    Kudos (other than fees) are invalid and have no effect."
          7/28    Called by Manu
          8/7-14  Assigned to OscarMeyr, who judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Such cards are neither the rules nor
            an instrument with Power >= 2.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  For the purpose of resolving
            conflicts, cards are considered part of the rule defining their
            Cardbook, and are thus able to change Kudos.

CFJ 1575  "root is required to deliver a legal judgement for CFJ 1278."
          8/26  Called by Goethe
          Caller's argument (summary):  root was only assigned to consider a
            motion, but Rule 408 still requires em to judge.
