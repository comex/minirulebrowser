ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"A Duty to Vote" by Murphy - Proposal 4514 adopted 7/10
   When an election fails quorum, eligible voters who didn't vote commit the
     Class 1 Infraction of Apathy.

"Invisibilitating" by Steve - Proposal 4513 adopted 7/10
   If an adopted proposal requires changes to the gamestate that are not
     required to be reported in any official report (except the publication
     of the proposal by the Promotor and Assessor), then the author commits
     the Class 0 Infraction of Invisibilitating, which any player may report.
   [Only the "any player may report" clause is part of a rule.]

"Non-Preferential Silent Treatment" by Murphy - Proposal 4511 adopted 7/10
   Update an obsolete reference to "preferred email address" in Rule 2036.
   If a player has multiple listed e-mail addresses, then the Registrar shall
     keep the Distributor informed of all of them.

"Publicize Organizations" by Sherlock - Proposal 4510 adopted 7/10
   The Notary's monthly report includes the SLC of each Organization.

"Vote Collector for Offices Does Not Move" by Murphy - Proposal 4508 failed
     quorum 6/25 - Complacent Oligarchy - Proposal 4509 adopted 7/10
   If the office of ADoP changes hands during an election for office, then the
     position of Vote Collector for that election does not move with it.

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

"Expunge Nomic Properties" by Maud - Proposal 4515 rejected 7/10
   Reword Rules 1274 and 594 to remove the phrase "Nomic Property".
   Repeal Rule 1011 (Definition of Nomic Property).

"Shuffle, Stem, Boon, Fix" by Peekee - Proposal 4512 rejected 7/10
   Update an obsolete reference to Stems that was accidentally re-added to
     Rule 2042.
   [This proposal is obsolete.  Proposal 4503 already implemented the fix.]

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Generalize Ratification" by Murphy - Proposal 4517
   The definition of "valid to ratify" no longer depends on ratification by
     proposal.
   Ratification by proposal is effective if the document is valid when the
     proposal takes effect.  (Validity of the document at any prior moment
     no longer matters.)

"Spelling Fix" by Murphy - Proposal 4516
   Fix "emphemeral" in Rule 1664.

-------------------

*** Rule 1567 causes ineligibility by request to expire after one month ***

CFJ 1449 "The Proposal entitled 'Full Discretion Fix' would have been
[TRUE]    Rubberstamped by the message sent by Cecilius today under the
Appealed  subject line 'Rubberstamping, Take Two,' if that Proposal had not
           already been Rubberstamped."
          Linked to CFJ 1448

          3/31    Eris moves to overturn and remand
          Judge Steve's refutation (summary):  Transfers (even of 0)
