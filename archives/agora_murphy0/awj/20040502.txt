ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Filibustering Take Two" by Elysion - Proposal 4570 adopted 5/2
  Ordinary Proposals may have an Adoption Index of 2 or greater, but are
    then Stalled and cannot be distributed (until it is Debated, thus
    changing its Chamber).

"Move Or" by Maud - Proposal 4568 adopted 4/26
  Correct a grammatical error in Rule 1963 due to a previous broken
amendment.

"Replacing Roles with Cards" by Wes - Proposal 4569 adopted 5/2
  Classes of Cards:
    * Distrib-u-Matic (Budgeted; make a proposal distributable)
    * Absolv-o-Matic (Budgeted; Limited Immaculate 1; expunge a blot
from
        any entity)
    * Debate-o-Matic (Budgeted; flip the chamber of a non-Sane proposal)
    * Boost-o-Matic (Budgeted; increase a team's points by 5; increase a
        team's points by 10 for a Fee of 1)

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Creating the Framework for Cards" by Wes - Proposal 4571 failed quorum
5/2 -
    Complacent Oligarchy
  The Deckmastor tracks Cards and their ownership.
  The Deckmastor's Budget contains the Maximum Hand Size (an integer
from 3
    to 10).
  The Deckmastor is Executor of the Deck, but may only cause it to act
as
    specified by the rules.  The Deck may not transfer cards unless
required.
  When required by the rules, the Deckmastor shall create or destroy
Cards
    by announcing the Card and its owner.
  Players and other rule-specified entities are Gamblers (may own
Cards).
  Unowned Cards are automatically transferred to the Deck.
  An entity's Hand is the set of eir Cards, and eir Hand Size is the
number
    of Cards in eir Hand.
  Each class of Card has a Caption (name), a Quota, zero or more
Elements, and
    zero or more Exploits.  Cards of the same class are fungible.
  Each class of Card should have exactly (Quota) instances.  If not,
Cards are
    created or destroyed as needed.  (The Deck's Cards are destroyed
first,
    followed by randomly selected instances.)
  Each Element has a rule-defined name and description.  All cards with
an
    Element behave according to its description.
  An Exploit is an action that the holder can take, after which the card
    returns to the Deck (unless a rule says otherwise).  "Playing a
card"
    means using one of its Exploits.
  Cards may be transferred by announcement.
  "Discarding a card" means transferring it to the Deck.
  "Drawing a card" means drawing it from the Deck.
  An entity may draw a card (for a Fee equal to the number of times e
has
    previously done so this month) if it is permitted to hold Cards, and
if
    eir Hand Size (including pending draws that the Deckmastor has not
yet
    processed) would not exceed the Maximum Hand Size.  The Deckmastor
shall
    randomly select one of the Deck's cards for each draw.
  Elements:
    * Budgeted (Quota is part of Deckmastor's Budget, default 3)
    * Handed X (counts as X cards toward Hand Size)
    * Restricted X (only entities of type X may use Exploits)
    * Limited X Y (entities not of type X must pay a Fee of Y to use
Exploits)
    * Persistant (not returned to Deck after it is used)
    * Bleed X (holder loses X points per week)

"Remove Redundancy" by Elysion
  Repeal Rule 1986 (c), which will never occur under the current form of
(a).

"Wacky Cards" by Wes - Proposal 4572 failed quorum 5/2 - Complacent
Oligarchy
  Classes of Cards:
    * ZOT! (Quota 1; Handed 3; reduce an entity's points by X*10 points
for a
        fee of X; cannot make an entity's points negative)
    * Oligarch of the Day (Quota 1; Restricted Senators; Oligarch for
rest of
        day)
    * Albatross Flies Away (Quota 1; Limited Immaculate 3; revoke one of
your
        Albatrosses)
    * Point Mine (Quota 1; Persistant; gain 1 point per week)
    * Dud (Quota 5? Budgeted? Persistant; does nothing)
    * Dud Fusion (Quota? Bleed 2; discard X Duds to gain X*20 points)
    * Player Stasis (Quota 1; a player of your choice can't play cards
for
        88 hours)
    * Hot Potato (Quota 1; Persistant; transfer to another entity, if
they
        don't announce "Hot Potato" within 48 hours then you can ding
them
        for the Class 1 Infraction of Dropping the Potato)
    * It's a Surprise! (Quota 1; Handed 2; draw two cards for free)

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Lobbying Strength" by Wes
  Lobbying Strengths decrease by 25% each month, instead of resetting to
the
    minimum strength.  The minimum strength remains at 1.

CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

*** Rule 1567 causes ineligibility by request to expire after one month
***

4/29  Eris requests to be ineligible to judge CFJ 1499

CFJ 1497  "If a person who is a player of both Agora and Claustronomic
[TRUE]     ceases to be a player of Agora, then e also ceases to be a
Appealed   player of Claustronomic."
          4/8   Called by Maud
          4/8   Assigned to Murphy, who judges TRUE
          4/8   Appealed by Maud, Eris, and Goethe
          4/10  Appeal assigned to Sherlock, Eris, and Michael
          4/10  Eris moves to REMAND
          4/13  Michael moves to REMAND
          4/24  Sherlock is recused
          4/29  Appeal assigned to OscarMeyr
          Caller's argument (summary):  C-as-a-nomic does not equate
"player
            of C-as-a-nomic" with "member of C-as-an-Agoran-contest", so
the
            statement should not be judged TRUE.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Regardless of C-as-a-nomic's
stance,
            Agora defines membership based on C-as-an-Agoran-contest.
          Appellant Maud's argument (summary):  But the last clause of
the
            statement asked about "player of C-as-a-nomic", not about
"member
            of C-as-an-Agoran-contest".

CFJ 1498  "No two Rules may legally have the same Title."
[FALSE]   4/12     Called by Wes
          4/18-21  Assigned to Sir Toby, who judges FALSE
          4/21     Appealed by root, Elysion, and Wes
          4/21     Appeal assigned to Goethe, Murphy, and RedKnight
          4/28     Murphy moves to REMAND
          4/29     RedKnight moves to SUSTAIN
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rules are Rule-defined
entities.  Rule
            Titles are names.  Rule 1586 (Definition and Continuity of
            Entities) applies.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Not all Rule-defined entities
have
            names.  Rules are not required to have names.  Rules do not
have
            names.  Nothing else prevents two Rules from having the same
Title.
          Appellate Judge Murphy's argument (summary):  "Name" and
"title" may
            be ordinary-language synonyms, so Rule 754 (4) may apply.  A
rule's
            title may include zero or more of ("Rule", number, title).

CFJ 1499  "Rule 2050 has been repealed."
          4/20  Called by Goethe
          4/20-29  Assigned to Eris, who makes emself ineligible
          5/2      Assigned to Pakaran
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 2050's self-repeal is a
rule
            change (Rule 105), and was not voted on or adopted, so Rule
107
            prevents it from taking effect.
          Commentary:  Rule 107 does not explicitly prohibit the Rules
from
            changing themselves, even without any voting or adoption.
