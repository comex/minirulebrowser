            Date: Wed, 18 Aug 1993 11:14:54 -0800 (PDT)
            X-Sequence: 863
          is incorrect and has to be
          changed to 6 For, 5 Against; hence Proposal 367 passes."
         8/30/93  Called by Ronald Kunne
         8/30/93  Judged TRUE by Alexx
         Commentary:  See CFJ 1349.

CFJ 1346 "The Bank is deemed to have incurred a debt of 3.0 Voting
[FALSE]   Entitlements to:
            (a) any and every judge who returns a judgment of TRUE on this CFJ,
                and;

                judgment of FALSE on this CFJ or sustains a judgment of TRUE on

         4/10     Called by Goethe
         4/10-11  Assigned to root, who Judges TRUE
         4/11-12  Appealed by Steve, Goddess Eris, and OscarMeyr
         4/15     Appeal incorrectly assigned to Murphy (Barred), OscarMeyr,
                    and Goddess Eris (see CFJs 1347 and 1348)
         4/16     Alleged Justice Murphy moves to overturn and dismiss
         4/16     Possible Justice OscarMeyr moves to overturn and dismiss
         4/17     Possible Justice Goddess Eris moves to overturn and reverse
         5/20     Appeal assigned to OscarMeyr, Goddess Eris, and Crito

         5/24     Crito moves to OVERTURN and REVERSE
         5/28     Goddess Eris moves to OVERTURN and REVERSE

CFJ 1347 "Murphy is not a Justice in Appeal 1346a."
[TRUE]   4/17     Called by root
         4/25-26  Assigned to t, who Judges TRUE
         Caller's argument (summary):  Murphy was Barred from Judging CFJ 1346
           by the Caller.  This made em ineligible to be a Justice, since eir
           ineligibility did not result in less than three eligible Justices.

CFJ 1348 "No Justices have been appointed in Appeal 1346a."
[TRUE]   4/17      Called by root
         4/25-5/4  Assigned to Murphy, who defaults
         5/8-13    Assigned to Sir Toby, who Judges TRUE
         5/13-14   Appealed by Steve and Crito
         Caller's argument (summary):  Murphy's assignment was invalid (see CFJ
           1347), and thus the selection attempt is entirely invalid.

CFJ 1349 "The Judgement of CFJ 21 was incorrect."
         4/17      Called by Syllepsis
         4/25-5/2  Assigned to Goddess Eris, who dismisses it
         Judge's commentary (summary):  The Ruleset in effect at the time of
           CFJ 21 is unavailable, so CFJ 21's correctness cannot be determined.

CFJ 1350 "Sir Toby's first insane proposal submitted on 18 April 2002 is a null
[TRUE]    proposal."
         4/18     Called by harvel
         4/25-26  Assigned to Sir Toby, who Judges TRUE
         Caller's argument (summary):  The Proposal in question has this body:
           YES MEANS NO
           NO MEANS YES
         which does not propose to change Rules or the Gamestate.

CFJ 1351 "Proposal 4285 is Insane."
[FALSE]  4/18      Called by Sir Toby
         4/25-5/2  Assigned to Syllepsis, who Judges FALSE
         5/2-3     Appealed by harvel and Sir Toby
         Caller's argument (summary):  The body of Proposal 4285 contains no
           miniscule letters.
         Judge's refutation (summary):  By Game Custom, the ###-delimited text
           is the body of the Proposal.  This includes the title, which
           contains miniscule letters.
         Sir Toby's counterargument (summary):  The Proposal Pool does not
           follow this Game Custom.  For instance, it omits the text "PROPOSAL"
           from the body of Proposal 02-051 (REALLY BAD WEATHER).

CFJ 1352 "The last paragraph of rule 1969 does not prohibit transferring Bonds
[TRUE]    that have already been redeemed."
         4/21      Called by Sir Toby
         4/29      Incorrectly assigned to Goddess Eris
         4/29-5/2  Assigned to Steve, who Judges TRUE
         5/12      Appealed by harvel
         Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1966 says that Bonds of the same
           species are fungible, and takes precedence over Rule 1969, so
           redeemed Bonds cannot be distinguished from unredeemed Bonds of the
           same species.

CFJ 1353 "Craig has more than 200 Stems."
[FALSE]  4/25   Called by Murphy
         5/2-4  Assigned to t, who Judges FALSE
         Caller's argument (summary):  Both Payroll Clerk Murphy (mistakenly
           identifying emself as Treasuror) and Treasuror Goethe attempted to
           transfer a New Player Award from the Bank to Craig.  If both Stem
           transfers succeeded, then Craig has 240 Stems; if only one
           succeeded, then Craig has 120 Stems.
         Judge's refutation (summary):  Murphy attempted to transfer the entire
           New Player Award in a single Notice of Transfer, but e lacked
           authority to transfer the non-Stem parts.  Rule 1598 (Property
           Transfers), clause (b)(2), requires the transferor to have authority
           to transfer all parts, so the entire Notice of Transfer (including
           the Stems) is invalid.

CFJ 1354 "Insane proposals, if adopted, have no effect."
[FALSE]  4/26   Called by Craig
         5/4-5  Assigned to root, who Judges FALSE
         Caller's argument (summary):  All Insane Proposals intend to coerce
           Players into Voting FOR them (to prevent the author from Winning),
           so Rule 1003 (No Coercive Proposals) makes them ineffective.
         Judge's refutation (summary):  CFJ 756 sets precedent that Rule 1003
           is invoked only by a penalty great enough to be coercive.  A Win
           (currently worth 25 Stems per month, for up to 4 months, plus a
           Patent Title) is not great enough to be coercive.

CFJ 1355 "Calls for Judgement (CFJs) can have titles."
[TRUE]   4/28    Called by harvel, with the alleged title "AIR ON G'S STRING"
         5/5-13  Assigned to Syllepsis, who defaults
         5/13    Assigned to Crito, who Judges TRUE
         Caller's argument (summary):  Unregulated, thus permitted by Rule 101
           (Obey the Rules).
         Commentary:  CFJ 1224 was called by Kelly, with the alleged title
           "Case of the Wayward Payment Order".

CFJ 1356 "The proposal titled 'A MODEST PROPOSAL' has no obvious and direct
[TRUE]    attempt to coerce a Player into voting against eir conscience."
         4/28   Called by root, with the alleged title "AIR ON G'S STRING"

[TRUE]   4/28     Called by harvel

         5/6-7    Appealed by root, harvel, and Sir Toby
         5/8      Appeal assigned to t, Syllepsis, and Crito
         5/13     Crito moves to SUSTAIN

         5/16     Syllepsis recused, replaced by OscarMeyr, who moves to
                    SUSTAIN
         Caller's argument (summary):  Currencies are implicitly ownable, and
           thus Property, as noted by Proposal 4018 (which defined Property as
           a generalization of Currency).
         Counterarguments:  Something is not necessarily true just because the
           Rules imply or assume it.  Does Proposal 4018's statement "Currency
           is Property", apart from its Rule changes, have any ongoing effect?
         t's commentary (summary):  If Rule 1467 were repealed, then "currency"
           would cease to be explicitly defined by the Rules, and would revert
           to its common definition.  One may own and owe common currencies
           even without the Rules' permission (the definition of Property).

CFJ 1358 "Proposal 4253 was not adopted."
[FALSE]  4/28   Called by root
         5/5-9  Assigned to Goethe, who Judges FALSE
         Caller's argument (summary):  Proposal 4245 was Ordinary and failed
           Quorum.  Proposal 4253 was a copy of it, with the same title.  Rule
           1586 (Definition and Continuity of Entities) prohibits two entities
           from having the same name or nickname.
         Judge's refutation (summary):  Proposals do not have Rule-defined
           names.  Game Custom is that a Proposal's name includes its Number.

CFJ 1359 "The proposal submitted in the message with Message ID:
[TRUE]    <200205010219.g412Jw062775@ke.earlham.edu> is insane."
         5/3     Called by Sir Toby
         5/8-11  Assigned to root, who Judges TRUE
         Caller's argument (summary):  The body and title of the Proposal
           are completely empty, and thus contain no miniscule letters.

CFJ 1360 "Murphy should not be penalized for eir recent failure to judge CFJ
[TRUE]    1348."
         5/5     Called by Craig
         5/8-15  Assigned to t, who Judges TRUE
         Caller's argument (summary):  Murphy's assignment to CFJ 1348 had the
           incorrect subject "OFF: CFJ 1348 assigned to root".  Due to an
           e-mail bug, Murphy did not see the body of the message.
         Judge's commentary (summary):  Trivially true because Murphy had
           already been penalized before this CFJ was Called.

CFJ 1361 "ALL of the following are True:
[FALSE]     (1) On or about May 7 2002, Goethe transferred 0.010 VEs to root.
            (2) On or about May 7 2002, Goethe transferred 0.010 VEs to
                Beverly.
            (3) The Registrar is required to track the nickname Beverly
                for the Player also known as root."
         5/7     Called by Goethe
         5/8-12  Assigned to Steve, who Judges FALSE
         Caller's argument (summary):  Goethe claimed to give root the nickname
           Beverly, and then attempted to transfer the VEs.
         Judge's refutation (summary):  (1) and (2) are true, but (3) is false
           because Goethe's nickname applies only to eir message.

CFJ 1362 "In the context of the rules, fungible means indistinguishable by any
[FALSE]   value other than ownership"
         5/8     Called by Syllepsis
         5/9-14  Assigned to Goethe, who Judges FALSE
         Caller's argument (summary):  This definition is implied by the last
           paragraph of Rule 1467 (Definition of a Currency).
         Judge's refutation (summary):  The Rules never explicitly define
           "fungible", so it begins with its common definition - which is not
           "indistinguishable", but rather "interchangeable in terms of
           satisfying debts/obligations".  Rule 1467 not only says that units
           of Currency are fungible, but also exempts their Rulekeepor from
           distinguishing them; this makes them indistinguishable.  Rule 1966
           (Bonds) exempts the Usuror from distinguishing Bonds by redemption
           status, but Rule 1942 (Property) then declares the Treasuror to be
           the Recordkeepor of Bonds by redemption status.

CFJ 1363 "Rule 1969 does not prohibit redeeming Bonds that have already been
[FALSE]   redeemed."
         5/8     Called by Sir Toby
         5/9-16  Assigned to OscarMeyr, who Judges FALSE
         Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1966 (Bonds) states that Bonds are
           fungible, and takes precedence over Rule 1969.
         Judge's refutation (summary):  Fungible Bonds are not necessarily
           indistinguishable.  Rule 1969 states that only unredeemed Bonds may
           be redeemed, and fungibility does not contradict this.

CFJ 1364 "Once any Bond of a given species becomes redeemed, all Bonds of that
[FALSE]   species become redeemed."
         5/8      Called by Syllepsis
         5/9      Assigned to Murphy, who Judges FALSE

                    to do so for CFJ 1346; this is later declared as not

                    REASSIGN
         5/28-31  Assigned to Goethe, who Judges FALSE
         Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1966 (Bonds) states that Bonds are
           fungible, and takes precedence over Rule 1969.
         Judge Murphy's refutation (summary):  Fungibility does not confuse
           Bonds owned by different entities.
         Judge Goethe's proto-refutation (summary):  This is refuted by the
           physical-entity model, as is (for instance) the destruction of a
           negative quantity of a Currency.

         Judge's commentary (summary):  There was an attempted transfer to

         5/14     Called by Steve
         5/21-28  Assigned to OscarMeyr, who Judges FALSE
         Judge's refutation (summary):  Rule 1598 (Property Transfers) allows
           a Player's Executor to transfer that Player's Property, and Rule
           1478 (Executors and Limited Executors) makes a Player eir own

         5/28-6/3  Assigned to root, who Judges TRUE
         6/3       Appealed by Goddess Eris
         Caller's argument (summary):  A Legislative Order takes effect, and
           thus does what it says it does, upon the adoption of the Proposal
           containing it.
         Judge's commentary (summary):  The relevant text within Proposal 4318
           is not a Legislative Order, but simply creates debts directly.  The
           Rules do not define "billing" without a Player doing it, so the
           common definition of "billing" - that debts are incurred - applies.

[TRUE]   5/16     Called by root

         Caller's argument (summary):  Insane Proposal 4296 received no FOR

           not explicitly state that e satisfies a Win Condition, but it

         5/28-6/3  Assigned to root, who Judges FALSE
         Caller's argument (summary):  Proposal 4318 itself constituted the
           notice of intent required by Rule 1917 (General Currency Taxation).
         Judge's refutation (summary):  The levy was claimed to be authorized
           by Rule 1891 (Legislative Orders), but Legislative Orders only
           require action; they do not necessarily permit it.  Proposal 4318
           was published only by its author (OscarMeyr) and the Promotor (t),
           so it cannot be a notice of intent for Payroll Clerk Murphy or eir
           Attorney Steve.
