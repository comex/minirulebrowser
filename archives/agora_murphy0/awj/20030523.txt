ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"ANF bugfixes" by Steve - Proposal 4497 adopted 5/12
    Significance (Historical, Hysterical, Ephemeral) is a Patent Title switch.
    Only Historical Patent Titles can gain points.
    Property of dissolute entities may be transferred to its Mintor or
      Recordkeepor, rather than to the Bank.
    If a type of Property ceases to exist, then debts in it cease to exist, and
      the former recordkeepor shall publish a closing report.
    Destroying a type of Property that you owe is the Crime of Writing Bad
      Checks.

     Oligarchy - Proposal 4492 adopted 5/5

     +10 all vote on a democratic proposal

     +10 all vote in an election

"Team Shuffling" by Peekee - Proposal 4483 failed quorum 4/22 - Complacent
     Oligarchy - Proposal 4491 adopted 5/5
   Upon a Team Win, the highest-Scoring Player in the highest-Scoring Team
     is assigned to the lowest-Scoring Team, and the lowest-Scoring Player

     are broken by the Scorekeepor's choice.

"Teams clean up" by Peekee - Proposal 4488 adopted 5/5
