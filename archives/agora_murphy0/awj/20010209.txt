ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Longer Holidays" by Steve - Proposal 01-003 adopted 1/29
  The Christmas holiday begins on December 24 (not December 25) and lasts until
    the first Nomic Week beginning after January 2 (not until January 1).
  Holidays may last up to 17 days.

"Oerjan's Fix Roles" by Elysion - Proposal 535 adopted 1/29
  Organizations may transfer eir Stems to Players within seven days of
    receiving them.
  Debts invalidated by the adoption of "Roles" are reinstated in Stems.
  Rule 1936 (Auctioning Positions in the Oligarchy) has the typo "On
    Politicians" corrected.

"Pragmatic Oligarchy" by Steve - Proposal 01-005 adopted 1/29
  An Oligarch loses eir position due to Inactivity, Zombiehood, Blots,
    Speakership, or rotation only when the Grand Warden of the Oligarchy
    announces it.
  Oligarchy Auction is moved out of Rule 1937 and into a separate Rule.
  Winning bids in an Oligarchy Auction become debts.
  Rule 1961 (a Rule with one-time application only) is repealed.

"Well fix it, dear Henry!" by Blob - Proposal 01-002 adopted 1/29
  Notary is an Office.

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Alternate Adoption System" by Elysion - Proposal 4104 rejected 1/12 (see CFJ
1261)
  All Proposals have an Adoption Index of 1, but (if adopted) a Power equal to
    their Voting Index.  For instance, if a Proposal attempts to amend both a
    Power=1 Rule and a Power=2 Rule, and it is adopted 7 FOR to 6 AGAINST (thus
    a Voting Index of 7/6), then the first amendment succeeds but the second
    fails.

"Clarify R1447" by Steve - Proposal 4109
  A late Justice is immediately recused from the Board.  Rule 1447 is currently
    ambiguous as to whether recusal is caused by lateness or by reporting the
    Infraction.

"Patent Titles Aren't Property!" by Ziggy - Proposal 4110
  In the Rules, "possess" and "own" refer only to Property.
  Patent Titles and Win Conditions are "borne", not "possessed".

"Start the Sanity-Insanity" by harvel
  Upon the adoption of this Proposal, the Treasuror shall pay out 100 Stems to
    each non-Senator.

"Tweak Scoring Events" by Elysion
  Only Player to Vote FOR or AGAINST someone else's Proposal is worth 2 Points,
    not 10.
  Gaining a Patent Title is not worth any Points.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"A Synthetic Zombie" by Steve
  There exists a Synthetic Zombie named Frankie.
  When Auctioning a Synthetic Zombie, the Starting Bid is 0.1 Indulgences, and
    a no-Bid Auction results in a new Auction.
  Rather than 1 Indulgence per quarter, the owner of a Synthetic Zombie is
    billed monthly upkeep, equal to the amount originally paid for the Zombie,
    doubled once per full month that the Zombie has been owned.  If this debt
    is not paid within a week, then it is forgiven and the owner is billed for
    the Zombie itself.
  Rather than power to transfer any Bank-owned Zombie, the Registrar only has
    power to transfer Zombies owed by the Bank to another entity.

"Clarify Possession" by Ziggy
  Patent Titles are Property.
  In the Rules, "possess" and "own" refer only to Property.
  Win Conditions are "held", not "possessed".

"Clarify Rule 459" by Elysion
  The Nomic Week begins at the beginning of Monday.

"Gooooooo Reading!" by Ziggy
  Let's go!  New Rule!
  Ready?  Okay!
  Give me an A!  Give me a G!  Give me an O!  Give me an R!  Give me an A!
  What's that spell?  Agora!
  Read to the left!  Read to the right! Up-down-up-down fight fight fight!

"Modify Rule 1922" by loh
  Patent Title of Bard may be awarded by a Bard With Support, or by any Player
    With 2 Supporters.  It may be revoked by a Bard With 2 Bard Supporters, or
    by any Player With 3 Supporters.

"Oligarchy Reform" (was "Undo Proposal 4104") by Elysion
  Proposal 4104 (if adopted; see CFJ 1261) causes all Proposals to have an
    Adoption Index of 1, but a Power equal to their Voting Index.  A side
    effect is that all Proposals are Ordinary by default.  This proto undoes
    that change, and increases Rule 594's (Proposals and Rule Changes) Power
    to 2.
  An Oligarch may resign by announcing that e does so.
  Rule 1933 (Ordinary and Democratic Proposals) is amended to avoid the
    problematic "operation of" text.
  An Ordinary Proposal that fails quorum becomes Democratic, and its Voting
    Period is extended accordingly.

"Reciprocal Dependant Actions" by Ziggy
  Supporters and Objectors cancel each other out, one to one.
  Four-day waiting period re-applied to Actions With N Supporters (since
    Objections to such actions are now relevant).
  No self-Support.

"Timing of Messages" by Steve
  Duty to send a message pays attention to time of sending.
  Effect of a message pays attention to time of receipt.

"VE Upkeep" by Blob
  The Treasuror's Budget contains the VE Upkeep, which is from 0 to 2 times the
    Basic Officer's Salary.
  At the beginning of the second month of each quarter, the Assessor bills each
    Player for the VE Upkeep times the number of VEs owned by that Player.  If
    such a debt remains outstanding for a week, the Assessor may forgive that
    debt and bill the Player for a VE instead.  (This clock stops running while
    the debt is disputed or the Player is On Hold.)


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1254  "Peekee possesses at least one Voting Token."
[FALSE]   11/20    Called by Murphy
          1/6-14   Assigned to David, who defaults
          1/14-15  Assigned to pTang, who Judges TRUE
          1/15-17  Appealed by harvel, Blob, and Oerjan
          1/17     Appeal assigned to Chuck, Steve, and Wes
          1/18     Steve moves to overturn and reverse
          1/21     Wes moves to overturn and reassign
          1/24     Chuck moves to overturn and dismiss
          1/24-31  Reassigned to Ziggy, who Judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Murphy attempted to create a Voting
            Token and transfer it to Peekee.
          Justice Steve's refutation (summary):  Bank Currency of VTs
            destroyed earlier.  Player-minted Currency invalid because Murphy
            did not specify a Recordkeepor or MUQ.  Player-created Property
            invalid because Property may only be created by methods defined by
            the Rules.  Extra-Ruleset entities invalid because Murphy did not
            physically create anything.
          Justice Wes's refutation (summary):  Even if Murphy created an
            imaginary VT by announcing such, no one knows what happened to it
            after that.
          Judge Ziggy's refutation (summary):  The Rules use "possess" almost
            exclusively to refer to Property, which VTs were not.

CFJ 1258  "Peekee is the Notary."
[TRUE]    12/18     Called by Murphy
          1/8-14    Assigned to lee, who Judges TRUE
          1/14      Appealed by Crito, Palnatoke, Elysion, and Blob
          1/15-16   Blob and Steve sign Dissenting Opinion
          1/16      Appeal assigned to Chuck, Steve, and Wes
          1/16      Steve moves to overturn and reverse
          1/21      Wes moves to overturn and reassign
          1/22      Chuck moves to overturn and reassign
          1/22-2/1  Reassigned to loh, who Judges TRUE
          2/1       Appealed by Crito and Elysion
          Caller's argument (summary):  Notary ceased to be an Office on 5/8,
            at which time Blob held it.  Had it remained an Office, a
            subsequent Election would have transferred it to Peekee.  Can that
            alleged Election be interpreted as effective anyway?
          Judge lee's argument (summary):  Yes, the Rules don't say otherwise.
          Justice Steve's refutation (summary):  No, Rule 1586 caused the
            position of Notary to cease to exist when its definition was
            repealed.
          Justice Wes's refutation (summary):  "Notary" may remain usefully
            defined by natural language.
          Counterargument:  No, Rule 1586 causes Blob to remain the Notary
            until the Rules change.
          Judge loh's argument (summary):  Notary ceasing to be an Office
            caused break in continuity, per Rule 1586.  Rules then implicitly
            defined Notary as a position, per Rule 1513.  This position may be
            filled by Player consensus, per Rule 101.
          Counterargument:  No, permissibility does not imply possibility.

CFJ 1259  "If this statement is true, Peekee is owed 100 Stems."
Dismissed 1/18     Called by Peekee
          1/18-29  Assigned to Murphy, who dismisses it
          2/5      Peekee submits Application to Submit Concurring Opinion
          2/6      Peekee executes Application to Submit Dissenting Opinion (e
                     pasted from the wrong file); it has no effect because it
                     lacks Signatures
          Caller's argument (summary):  FALSE would be self-contradictory.
          Judge's argument (summary):  TRUE would falsely imply that Peekee was
            owed 100 Stems.  Dismissed per Rule 1565 ii).
          Peekee's attempted Concurring Opinion (summary):  The statement *can*
            logically admit to being TRUE - in a hypothetical universe in which
            Peekee is owed 100 Stems.  However, Rule 1563 requires the
            statement to *actually be* either TRUE or FALSE, and provides valid
            grounds for dismissal.
          Counterargument:  Rule 1565 ii) may be interpreted as "Its Statement
            (can not logically admit to being TRUE) or (can not logically admit
            to being FALSE)", the latter clause of which applies to this CFJ.

CFJ 1260  "Elysion committed the Crime of Misrepresentation in eir message
[TRUE]     dated Mon, 08 Jan 2001 14:54:47 -0500."
          1/21     Called by Elysion
          1/22-29  Assigned to Steve, who Judges TRUE
          Commentary:  Elysion and Assessor t established a private code
            equating AGAINT with FOR.  Elysion then claimed to Vote 3xAGAINT
            Proposal 4104.  Elysion's clear and admitted intent was to be
            perceived by most Players as Voting 3xAGAINST.  If this counts as
            presenting that information as correct, then the Statement is TRUE;
            if the listener is solely responsible for incorrect interpretation
            based on incomplete information, then the Statement is FALSE.

CFJ 1261  "Proposal 4104 passed."
[FALSE]   1/23     Called by Elysion
          1/23-29  Assigned to harvel, who Judges FALSE
          2/1      Appealed by t
          2/5      Ziggy Moves to revoke Elysion's 4 Points for the adoption
          2/6      Motion assigned to harvel
          Commentary:  Elysion and Assessor t established a private code
            equating AGAINT with FOR.  Elysion then claimed to Vote 3xAGAINT
            Proposal 4104.  If AGAINT is an obvious synonym of FOR, then the
            Statement is TRUE; otherwise, whether Elysion Voted 3xAGAINST or
            did not Vote at all, the Statement is FALSE.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  AGAINT is ambiguous - it could have
            coded for FOR, or been a misspelling of AGAINST - hence the
            Assessor was not informed of Votes, hence no Votes were cast.
          Counterargument:  The Assessor must always interpret Votes received.

CFJ 1262  "Chuck was a Justice for CFJ 1254 on Jan 24 at the time that e posted
[TRUE]     eir decision to OVERTURN and Dismiss."
          1/29   Called by Wes
          2/1-5  Assigned to Peekee, who Judges TRUE
          Commentary:  The belief that Chuck acted late was due to an error in
            the CFJ history.

CFJ 1263  "Goethe is not a Player."
[FALSE]   2/4    Called by Blob
          2/4-8  Assigned to Steve, who Judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Goethe requested registration in a-d,
            declared eir registration in the PF, but did not explicitly request
            registration in the PF till shortly after this CFJ.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  A person registers by sending a
            message to the PF, so time of sending matters.  Goethe's first
            message was to a-d, eir second did not mention registration, and
            eir fourth was too late to affect this CFJ; but eir third was
            effective, as the requirement to "request registration" is
            figurative.

CFJ 1264  "Clerk of the Courts Wes has failed to perform eir duty to distribute
[FALSE]    CFJ 1263 in a timely manner."
          2/4  Called by Wes
          2/4  Assigned to loh, who Judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  This CFJ will be trivially FALSE, but
            was filed with the Justiciar to serve as the subject of CFJ 1265.

CFJ 1265  "The Justiciar is required by the Rules to act in some way in
           response to the Call for Judgement earlier in this email."
          2/4  Called by Wes
          2/4  Assigned to Kelly
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 991 (requiring the Clerk of the
            Courts to act upon a submitted CFJ) takes precedence over Rule 1831
            (requiring the Justiciar to perform the duties of the Clerk of the
            Courts for CFJs filed with em).

CFJ 1266  "1.  That of the following two messages,
Dismissed  http://www.escribe.com/games/agora-business/m2253.html
           and
           http://www.escribe.com/games/agora-business/m2255.html
           exactly ONE legally registered Goethe as a player in the game of
           Agora. The other one is either incorrect or superfluous.
           2.  That at a time 1 minute immediately BEFORE the SEND date
           listed in Goethe's e-mail header for m2253, normalized to GMT as
           Feb 5 0:22:49 (anecdotal evidence available on request), Goethe
           unambiguously was NOT a player.
           3.  That at a time 1 minute immediately AFTER the latest
           distribution date of m2255 listed in e-scribe, normalized to GMT
           as Feb 5 as 1:19:24, Goethe unambiguously WAS a player.
           4.  That, from these time indications, rounding to the minute,
           Goethe's Window of Ambiguity of Status as Player (GWASP) extends
           ABSOLUTELY NO LONGER than between GMT 0:21:00 and GMT 1:21:00 on
           Feb 5, 2001.
           5.  That Goethe's instant of becoming a player lies unambiguously
           within es GWASP.
           5.  While judgements on timestamps or the legality of the first
           message (c.f. http://www.escribe.com/games/agora-official/m967.html)
           may narrow the extent of this GWASP, no judgement may extend it.
           6.  Therefore, irrespective of the EXACT moment of Goethe's
           registration, and independent of any decisions further refining
           the exact moment, any game events, payments or adjustments,
           mandated by the rules to occur to Goethe's status, which must
           happen WITHIN a time period following registration, must use a
           registration date for Goethe NO LATER THAN 1:21:00 Feb. 5, 2001 in
           determining time of occurrence.
           7.  Likewise, any game events, payments, or adjustments mandated
           by the rules to occur a certain time AFTER Goethe's registration
           must use a registration date for Goethe NO EARLIER THAN 0:21:00
           Feb. 5, 2001 in determining its time of occurrence."
          2/6    Called by Goethe
          2/7    Assigned to Crito, who dismisses it
          2/7-8  Appealed by Kelly, Ziggy, lee, and harvel

CFJ 1267  "Syllepsis is a Scribe."
[TRUE]    2/6    Called by Grech
          2/7-8  Assigned to Blob, who Judges TRUE
          2/8    Appealed by Goethe
          Caller's argument (summary):  If parsed from left to right / top to
            bottom, "I become a Scribe" is complete before "I become a
            Politician'.

CFJ 1268  "Peekee has committed the Crime of Application Fraud as described in
[TRUE]     Rule 1626 by claiming that eir Application (included in Evidence
Appealed   below) was signed by Players who did not actually sign that
           Application."
          2/7  Called by Wes
          2/7  Assigned to lee, who Judges TRUE
          2/8  Appealed by Peekee
          Caller's argument (summary):  Peekee published a Dissenting Position,
            then changed it to Consenting and got some signatures, then
            mistakenly sen the Dissenting copy.
