ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Applications Revisited" by Kelly - Proposal 4159 adopted 5/28
  Non-Players may submit Applications.
  Players do not sign Applications directly, but consent to eir signature being
    attached by the submitter.

"Fix 'Complacent Oligarchy'" by Steve - Proposal 4161 adopted 5/28
  When an Ordinary Proposal fails quorum, the Assessor shall publish a Notice
    of Complacency, which puts a Democratic Distributable copy back into the
    Pool (so it gets reported as part of a normal Proposal Distribution).
  Publishing a Notice of Complacency for an Ordinary Proposal that achieved
    Quorum is the Class 2 Crime of Sending It Back Where It Don't Belong.

"Make Rule 1827 Consistent" by root - Proposal 4160 adopted 5/28
  Judicial Motions must be granted or denied within five days.  The Rule
    currently uses five days when imposing the requirement, but seven days
    when specifying the Infraction for failiure.

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

"Poor Man's Agora" by Syllepsis - Proposal 4158 rejected 5/28
  A Sanctimonious Player is all of the following:
    * an Immaculate Senator
    * neither a Zombie nor a Zombie Master
    * possesses no VEs, and at most 4 x BOS in Stems
    * controls no other entity (other than the Bank or Monastery) possessing
        Zombies, VEs, or Stems
  A Player Sanctimonious for at least a week may become a Monk.
  A Monk reported as non-Sanctimonious for at least 48 hours ceases to be a
    Monk at the beginning of the next week.
  At the beginning of the month, or while there is no Abbot, the Stem-poorest
    Monk (ties broken randomly) becomes Abbot, Executor of the Monastery.
  The Monastery may give away its VEs, as long as it keeps at least five.
  For Democratic Proposals, the Voting Power of the Monastery is one plus the
    number of VEs it holds.
  Any Monk may make a Proposal Democratic, With 3 Monk Supporters.
  Any Player or set of Players may make a Proposal Democratic by giving 0.3 VEs
    to the Monastery.

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Bonds Revisited" by Blob
  The Usuror is a Limited Executor of the Bank, able to satisfy Bond debts owed
    by the Bank.
  The Usuror's Budget includes the Credit Limit for Bank Currencies other than
    Stems, between 0 and 10 of the Currency's MUQ.

"Calling Bonds" by Kelly - Proposal 4163
  The issuer of a Bond may call it (accelerating it immediately) by announcing
    that e does so.

"Choosable Auctions, Vickrey Auctions, and Raffles" by root - Proposal 4167
[Choosable Auctions and Vickrey Auctions originally authored by Elysion]
  An Auctioneer may choose any Rules-defined Auction procedure; the current one
    is the default if e does not.
  In a Vickrey Auction:
    * The Auction lasts one week.
    * Bidders may bid privately.
    * Players with the same Executor as the Auctioneer must bid in public, and
        during the first three days.
    * The Auction Price is the highest non-winning bid.
  In a Raffle:
    * All tickets cost the same amount.
    * Winning tickets are randomly selected.
    * The Riff-Raff may pay out the Ticket Price to emself if there were at
        least three winners other than emself.  (A similar provision is removed
        from Papyrus Auctions.)

"Fix Dereliction of Duty" by Murphy - Proposal 4164
  Rule 1644 (Dereliction of Duty) is merged into Rule 1686 (Official Reports)
    in a consistent fashion.

"Fixing Unready Judges" by root
  A Grace Period no longer makes a Player ineligible to Judge CFJs.

"Fix Mentor's Bonus" by root
  The Mentor Bonus equals the New Player Award for Stems, not for all
    Currencies.

"Fix Rule 1686" by Syllepsis
  Failure to Report is detectable by the Assistant Director of Personnel (not
    the Grand Warden of the Oligarchy).

"Fix Rule 1868" by Elysion - Proposal 4166
  The Clerk of the Courts is required to select and announce a Judge based on a
    single ASAP requirement, rather than two requirements in succession.

"Poor Man's Agora" by Syllepsis
  Identical to the recently rejected Proposal 4158 (see above), except that it
    is Sane.  (12 Players Voted FOR Proposal 4158; 5 Voted AGAINST.)

"Proper Persistent Indebtedness" by Kelly - Proposal 4165
  The creditor of a debt may simply demand its satisfaction, rather than
    Ordering such.
  Persistent Indebtedness is committed:
    * By an entity's Executor, or (if none) its Limited Executor.
    * Only if the Executor (Limited Executor) is authorized to execute a
        transfer for that entity which would satisfy the debt.
    * Only if the entity has Property sufficient to satisfy the debt.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Complacent Budgeting" by Murphy
  An Officer who Nominates without a Proto-Budget is deemed to have submitted
    one identical to the current Budget.

"Consistent Executorship" by Steve
  An entity (Executee) may have multiple Executors.
  A Limited Executor is explicitly defined (and still allowed to perform, on
    the Executee's behalf, only what the Rules explicitly permit).
  A Player is always eir own Executor, even if e has another Executor (e.g. via
    Power of Attorney).

"Corporations" by t
  Corporations are Organizations.
  An entity may become a Shareholder or the Director only as defined by the
    Rules.
  Each Corporation mints its Shares as a Currency.  All entities possessing at
    least one Share are Shareholders, except the Bank and the Corporation
    itself.
  Share transfers from the Corporation must be explicitly allowed by its
    Charter.  Share transfers to the Corporation may not be restricted by its
    Charter.  Other Share transfers require the payee's consent.
  A Corporate Conference lasts seven days.  Each Shareholder has as many votes
    as e has Shares.
  A Corporate Conference may not be called if one is already in progress,
    unless permitted by the Rules or the Charter.
  A Shareholder may call a Conference to amend the Charter.  A simple majority
    is required.
  A Shareholder may call a Conference to remove the Director.  A 2/3 majority
    is required.
  The Notary shall call a Conference to choose a Director, if there is none;
    this cancels any Conference in progress for that Corporation.  A plurality
    is required.  The Notary breaks ties.  If no votes are cast, the
    Corporation is dissolved.
  Upon the dissolution of a Corporation, each Shareholder gets part of its
    Currency in proportion to eir Shares.  All other Property is transferred to
    the Bank.  A Corporation cannot submit a Will.

"Fix New Player Award" by root
  Rule 1479 creates a debt when an Order requires a Player to pay out or bill
    Property.  Currently, such a requirement is only effective if it comes from
    the Rules.
  While such an Order is stayed or vacated, any Orders to pay the resulting
    debts shall also be stayed or vacated (respectively).

"Generalized Currency Circulation Levels" by Murphy
  For each Currency:
    * Ideal Circulation Average is 1.
    * Ideal Circulation Level is ICA times number of Players.
    * Actual Circulation Level is Credits (non-Bank holdings, debts owed by
        Bank, pending Auction bids, Bonds) minus Debits (debts owed to Bank).
    * Surplus is ACL minus ICL.
  Defaults for Surplus Auctions are defined.
  VE Auctions occur when VE Surplus is positive at beginning of month.
  Indulgence Auctions occur when VE Surplus is positive at beginning of month,
    with Blots adding to the ICL of Indulgences.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1295  "The Orders issued by Blob in <20010508144200.E5865@cse.unsw.edu.au>
[FALSE]    http://www.escribe.com/games/agora-business/m3682.html are
Appealed   improperly or invalidly executed."
          5/9      Called by Razl
          5/10-17  Assigned to Evantine, who Judges TRUE and vacates Blob's
                     Orders
          5/13     Evantine submits and grants a Motion to emself, and Orders
                     Clerk of the Courts Wes to stay Blob's Orders ASAP
          5/14     Clerk of the Courts Wes stays Blob's Orders
          5/17-18  Appealed by Taral, Kelly, and lee
          5/19     Appeal assigned to Steve, Kelly, and Wes
          5/19     Wes moves to sustain
          5/22     Steve moves to overturn and reassign
          5/23     Kelly moves to overturn and reassign
          5/23     Lead Justice Steve, with Kelly's assent, executes Appelate
                     Orders vacating Judge Evantine's vacation of Blob's Orders
          5/25-30  Reassigned to Lindrum, who Judges FALSE
          5/30     Lindrum vacates all previous Orders to stay Blob's Orders
          6/3-4    Appealed by Murphy, Evantine, and Goethe
          6/4      Clerk of the Courts Taral stays Blob's Orders
          6/4      Appeal assigned to Steve, Kelly, and Taral
          Caller's argument (summary):  Orders to satisfy debts are regulated
            by Rule 1599 and may target only the debtor, not its Executor or
            Limited Executor.
          Judge Evantine's argument (summary):  The Orders are Administrative
            Orders (Blob prefaced them with "As Executor of the Bank"), hence
            they are regulated, hence they are not blanket-permitted by Rule
            101; and they are not explicitly permitted by the Rules, hence they
            are invalid.
          Justice Steve's argument (summary):  Although Blob is Executor of the
            Bank because e is Treasuror, e was not necessarily carrying out a
            Treasuror duty.  In particular, it doesn't matter what type of
            Order Blob intended to make, only what type of Order e actually
            made.  Treasuror duties are limited to what the Rules explicitly
            impose, so the Orders are Private and valid (but may or may not be
            proper).
          Justice Kelly's argument (summary):  The Orders are Private, for the
            same reasons given by Steve.  They are valid, because no Rule says
            they are not.  They may or may not be proper, and the truth of the
            Statement depends on their propriety.
          Judge Lindrum's argument (summary):  Blob (Executor of the Bank) is
            explicitly allowed (Rule 1599) to Order Razl (Executor of the
            Bank's debtors) to act as if e were the debtors (Rule 1478) and
            satisfy the debts.
          Counterarguments:  Notary Razl is Limited Executor, not Executor, of
            the debtors.  Rule 1478 does not equate the Executor and Executee
            except when the Executor acts on behalf of the Executee.  It is not
            a duty of the Notary to satisfy debts owed by abandoned Players.

CFJ 1297  "lee cast 5 votes against proposal 4158."
[FALSE]   5/23     Called by lee
          5/25-29  Assigned to Crito, who Judges TRUE
          5/29     Appealed by Taral, Crito, and Goethe
          5/29     Appeal assigned to Wes, Steve, and Kelly
          6/3      Steve moves to overturn and reverse
          6/4      Wes recused due to going On Hold, replaced by Taral
          6/4      Kelly moves to overturn and reverse
          6/9      Taral moves to overturn and reverse
          Caller's argument (summary):  The Assessor's Report for the week in
            question correctly reported that lee possessed 2.3 VEs at report
            time, but 5.3 VEs at beginning of week, hence Voting Power on
            Democratic Proposals of 5 for that week.
          Counterargument (summary):  lee is a Low Oligarch, so eir Voting
            Power on Democratic Proposals is at most 3 (Rule 1950).

CFJ 1298  "'Distributor' is a Patent Title which may be changed at the opinion
           of the Registrar."
          5/30  Called by Goethe
          6/4   Assigned to Razl
          Caller's argument (summary):  'Distributor' continues to be a Unique
            Patent Title, because it used to be defined by Rule 1923/5 and has
            not been explicitly revoked.  Rules 1923/6 and 1670/13 now describe
            'Distributor' without referring to it as a Patent Title.

CFJ 1299  "The Bank has incurred an infinite number of debts to Goethe for each
[FALSE]    Bank Currency, and each of these debts is a debt for a minimum of 1
           MUQ of one of the Bank Currencies."
          5/31  Called by Goethe
          6/4   Assigned to root, who Judges FALSE
          6/4   root vacates Goethe's Orders
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1677 may replace one New Player
            Award (NPA) debt with four NPA debts (one in each of four
            Currencies), then replacing each of the four NPA debts with four
            NPA debts (resulting in sixteen NPA debts), and so on ad infinitum.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  "New Player Award" (without further
            qualification) means "New Player Award in the total of all
            Currencies"; it is not the same as "New Player Award in (any one
            Currency)".

CFJ 1300  "A Limited Executor of the Bank may be issued a valid and proper
[TRUE]     Private Order to satisfy the Bank's debt for a property e has the
           authority to transfer from the Bank."
          6/4     Called by Goethe
          6/4-10  Assigned to Hooloovoo, who Judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1470 clause (d) applies.
          Judge's commentary (summary):  Rule 1470 does not regulate the type
            of Order, so Private Orders are valid.

CFJ 1301  "Rule 1479 should be interpreted such that an Order, which requires a
           Player to pay out one or more Properties to some entity, and which
           is valid and proper under the Rules, causes the Bank to incur one or
           more debts to the named entity."
          6/7  Called by root
          6/9  Assigned to Syllepsis
          Commentary:  Rule 1479 creates a debt from a pay-out only if it is
            "required by the Rules".  For Orders with ASAP timing, Rule 1023
            contains a Rule requirement.  For Orders with no explicit timing,
            Rule 1795 assigns implicit ASAP timing.  However, for Orders with
            explicit non-ASAP timing, there is no direct Rule requirement; Rule
            1810 Criminalizes non-compliance, but does not actually require
            compliance.  The Rules may be interpreted as indirectly requiring
            Order-based pay-outs (by stating that the Orders directly require
            compliance).
