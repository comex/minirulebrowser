"Shuffle, Stem, Boon, Fix" by Peekee - Proposal 4501 failed quorum 5/27 -
     Complacent Oligarchy - Proposal 4503
   Correct an errant reference to Stems in Rule 2042 (Team Wins) that was
     changed to a Boon by "Of what price honor?" and then mistakenly changed
     back to Stems by "Team Shuffling".

"Third Time's the Charm, Part 1 of 3" by Murphy

   Retroactively fix Agoran epochs to apply only to absolute durations (e.g.
     "during the same month") and not to relative durations (e.g. "within one

"Third Time's the Charm, Part 3 of 3" by Murphy
   Retroactively avoid the use of mathematical definitions for terms whose
     primary definition is non-mathematical.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

*** Rule 1567 causes ineligibility by request to expire after one month ***

CFJ 1449 "The Proposal entitled 'Full Discretion Fix' would have been
[TRUE]    Rubberstamped by the message sent by Cecilius today under the
Appealed  subject line 'Rubberstamping, Take Two,' if that Proposal had not
           already been Rubberstamped."
          Linked to CFJ 1448
          3/3     Called by Cecilius
          3/9-17  Assigned to Goethe, who Judges TRUE
          3/20    Appealed by Steve, Sir Toby, and Pakaran
          3/20    Appeal assigned to Steve, Eris, and Pakaran
          3/24    Steve moves to overturn and reverse
          3/31    Eris moves to overturn and remand
          Judge Steve's refutation (summary):  Transfers (even of 0)
            require a valid Notice of Transfer, and a Notice of Transfer
            for 0 cannot be valid.
          Commentary:  A Rubberstamped Proposal may be Rubberstamped again.

CFJ 1461 "One or more tax debts of one or more bouncy balls were created as
           a result of a message sent by root on May 27, 2003."
          5/26  Called by root
          6/5   Assigned to Eris
          Caller's argument (summary):  The first tax notice may have been
            invalid because it did not include "everyone else: zero" in the
            required list of currency holdings and tax debts.

CFJ ???? "Murphy is the vote collector in the election for Registrar."
          6/7  Called by Murphy
          Caller's argument (summary):  The title of vote collector may have
            moved with the office of ADoP, which changed hands during the
            nominating period.
