ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"A REVOLUTION IN ENTITLEMENTS" by Goethe - Proposal 4232 improperly Aborted;
    Proposal 4235 adopted 11/28
  The Assessor shall destroy 50% of all non-Bank VE holdings (exempting 0.5 VEs
    per Player) and creating an equal quantity in the Bank's possession.

"Stems Shall Grow" by Goethe - Proposal 4231 improperly Aborted; Proposal 4234
    adopted 11/28
  If two entities owe the same amount of some fungible Property to each other,
    then either one may satisfy both debts by announcing it.
  A Land Auctioneer may (with 2 Supporters) change the bidding Currency from
    Indulgences to a different Bank Currency.
  Each month, the Weather is (20% chance Foul, 30% Fair, 20% Plenty, 30% same
    as previous month).  Upon the Treasuror's announcement:
      X = number of Players * Minimum Income.
      X Bank Stems are decreased by 50% if Foul, increased by 50% if Plenty.
  The initial Weather is Fair.
  The Treasuror may not cause the Bank to mint Stems.

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

"Read the Ruleset Week" by harvel - Proposal 4230 improperly Aborted; Proposal
    4233 rejected 11/28
  An index of 4 is greater than any other index (including Unanimity).
  Each Emperor has power 4 and takes precedence over the Rules.  
  harvel is the one and only Emperor.
  This Rule may not be repealed or amended.  
  This Rule takes precedence over every other Rule.

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Fix Prime Executor Stuff" by neil
  Receiving Stolen Property, applying to the debtor and to eir Prime Executor,
    is clarified to apply to eir Prime Executor for the purpose of satisfying
    that debt.
  Wills, requiring that the Dissolute was not Silent when e lost eir Prime
    Executor, is clarified to require that e was not Silent when e lost eir
    last Prime Executor.
  Power of Attorney explicitly states its non-conflict with any other Rule
    that prevents the Holder from holding the Grantor's Power of Attorney.

"MAKE INSANITY MORE FUN" by neil
  A Player's Votes on an Insane Proposal must be all the same (i.e. all FOR,
    all AGAINST, or all ABSTAIN).

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Death and Taxes" by neil
  The Treasuror's Budget includes the Quarterly Stem Tax Rate (between 10% and
    50%, initially 25%) and Exemption (no greater than twice the New Player's
    Award in Stems, initially 150 Stems).
  ASAP after the beginning of each quarter, the Treasuror shall levy a Stem Tax
    according to these amounts; the Exemption applies to all taxable entities.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1328 "The AgoraEx exists in the eyes of the Rules."
[TRUE]   11/16       Called by Goethe
         11/18-20    Assigned to Syllepsis, who dismisses it
         11/21       Appealed by Taral, root, Crito, and harvel
         11/21-23    Appeal assigned to Steve, root, and Murphy, who
                       unanimously move to overturn and reassign
         11/24-12/3  Reassigned to Steve, who Judges TRUE
         Caller's argument (summary):  The AgoraEx is a series of binding
           agreements between Players, but was not an entity with an Executor.
         Judge Syllepsis's refutation (summary):  The Rules have no eyes.
         Judge Steve's argument (summary):  Binding agreements between Players
           are recognized by Rule 1742.

CFJ 1329 "neil is Speaker-Elect."
Dismiss  11/20     Called by neil
         11/24-28  Assigned to Goethe, who dismisses it
         11/29     Appealed by Crito
         Judge's argument (summary):  It is unclear whether "Speaker-Elect"
           should be expanded to "holder of the Office of Speaker-Elect" or
           "Electee to the Office of Speaker-Elect".  It is also unclear
           whether another Rule takes precedence over Rule 1006's provision
           that each Office always has exactly one holder.

CFJ 1330 "neil is Electee to the Office of Speaker-Elect."
[TRUE]   11/20     Called by neil
         11/24-30  Assigned to root, who Judges TRUE
         Judge's argument (summary):  Nothing prevented neil's Nomination, and
           being the only Nominee, neil became Electee (though not necessarily
           holder).

CFJ 1331 "Steve is the Holder of the Office of Speaker-Elect."
         12/3     Called by neil
         12/3-12  Assigned to Syllepsis, who is recused

CFJ 1332 "Immediately after neil became Electee to the Office of
[FALSE]   Speaker-Elect (at approximately 00:23:21 on 21 Nov 2001 GMT),
Appealed  Steve held the Office of Speaker-Elect."
         12/8      Called by neil
         12/8-12   Assigned to Crito, who Judges FALSE
         12/12-13  Appealed by root, Murphy, and Michael
         Judge's argument (summary):  Steve did not become Speaker-Elect on
           November 15 or on November 20.
         Counterargument:  Michael and Murphy declined to be Speaker-Elect at
           appropriate times, Steve did become Speaker-Elect on November 15,
           and it is unclear what happened on November 20.
         Relevant chronology:
           10/1   New quarter begins, triggering Speaker Transition.
           10/19  Speaker Transition announced.  solublefish becomes Speaker.
                    neil becomes non-Electee Speaker-Elect.
           11/12  solublefish gives up Speakership, triggering Speaker
                    Transition.
           11/12  neil Nominates for Speaker-Elect.
           11/13  Michael declines to be Speaker-Elect.
           11/15  Murphy declines to be Speaker-Elect.
           11/15  Speaker Transition announced.  neil becomes Tainted Speaker.
                    Steve becomes non-Electee Speaker-Elect.  (If Michael
                    and/or Murphy had not declined between 11/12 and now, then
                    this announcement would have been incorrect and thus
                    ineffective.)
           11/20  neil becomes Electee to Speaker-Elect.  Existence of Tainted
                    Speaker, plus existence of Electee to Speaker-Elect,
                    triggers Speaker Transition.  Holder of Speaker-Elect is
                    no longer determined by Order of Succession, which applies
                    only when there is no Electee to Speaker-Elect.
           11/21  Murphy attempts to decline to be Speaker-Elect.  However,
                    there is an Electee to Speaker-Elect, and Rule 786 only
                    considers declinations since there was last an Electee.
           11/22  Michael attempts to decline to be Speaker-Elect.  However,
                    there is an Electee to Speaker-Elect, and Rule 786 only
                    considers declinations since there was last an Electee.
         Argument for TRUE:  Order of Succession is a one-time effect that
           causes Steve to hold Speaker-Elect.  Steve then continues to hold
           Speaker-Elect till something else causes someone else to hold it.
           neil becoming Electee on 11/20 does not cause em to hold it, because
           Rule 1647 takes precedence over Rule 1555.  Steve holds
           Speaker-Elect at the time mentioned in the Statement.
         Argument for FALSE:  Order of Succession is a continuous effect that
           causes Steve to hold Speaker-Elect.  When Order of Succession ceases
           to apply, then Steve ceases to hold Speaker-Elect.  neil does not
           hold it, because Rule 1647 takes precedence over Rules 1006 and
           1555, and Rule 103 prevents neil from becoming holder of
           Speaker-Elect and ceasing to be Speaker.  No one holds Speaker-Elect
           at the time mentioned in the Statement.

CFJ 1333 "hooloovoo transferred 0.7 VEs, 1.81 Indulgences, and 3.15 Papyri to
          AgorEx Offshore just before eir most recent Deregistration."
         12/11  Called by root

CFJ 1334 "Ten Land Auctions began on December 11, 2001 using VEs as the Auction
          Currencies."
         12/11  Called by root

CFJ 1335 "The Notice of Speaker Transition issued Sat, 8 Dec 2001 was incorrect
          in its particulars."
         12/12  Called by Crito
         Caller's argument (summary):  Michael, not Steve, was Speaker-Elect at
           the time.  See the Judge's argument for CFJ 1332.

CFJ 1336 "Murphy declined the Office of Speaker-Elect in the message
          http://www.escribe.com/games/agora-business/m5768.html"
         12/12  Called by Murphy
