    adopted 5/5
  An Agoran Contract is a Contract between any two entities.  It may only be

  Bi-Weekly Reports need only be published every two weeks.
  The Weekly Reports of the Assistant Director of Personnel, Clerk of the

  A player may create a new Card type by publishing a Card Blueprint.  It is
    in its Trial Run.  It has Quota 1, and a copy is created in the Library's
    possession, but it cannot be checked out for seven days.  It is returned
    to the Library after it is played.  Any player may destroy it by
    announcement.

"Clarify Card Plays" by root - Proposal 4733 adopted 5/5

"Clarify Rule 2023" by Murphy - Proposal 4746 sanitised 4/24 - Proposal 4752

  CFJs submitted to the Justiciar must be explicitly marked as such, and the
    Justiciar performs duties and fills roles instead of (not in addition to)
    the Clerk of the Courts.

"Contracts" by Manu - Proposal 4743 adopted 5/5
  Subordinate Legal Contracts, Organizations, and Contests are collapsed into
    Contracts (a few longer rules instead of many short rules; create/join by

"Disinterested in Disinteresting" by Sherlock - Proposal 4747 sanitised 4/24 -
    Proposal 4753 adopted 5/5
  Repeal Disinterested Proposals.

    only card draws due to Disinterested Proposals were immune.)

"Easier Card Fees" by Manu - Proposal 4738 adopted 5/5
  Card fees shall be paid as soon as possible.  For each kudo not paid on

  Only active players may make other players inactive.

    adopted 5/15
  Each player may gain at most five Boons of Prodigy.
  All card draws due to proposals are subject to Hand Size.  (Before this
    proposal, only card draws due to Interested Proposals were subject.)

"Make Those Cards Work" by Quazie - Proposal 4744 adopted 5/5
  Change the Exploits of Reshuffle and Chaos Apple from "the Deckmastor must
    X" to "you may X".

    X" to "you may X".

  Repeal the following rules:
    Rule  651 (Heroes)
    Rule 1064 (Freedom of Information Act)
    Rule 1550 (Ratification by Proposal)
    Rule 1630 (Impersonation)
    Rule 1717 (The Senate)
    Rule 1726 (The Guillotine)
    Rule 1926 (The Official Secrets Act), but Unlawful Vote Disclosure
      remains a Crime
    Rule 2056 (Invisibilitating)

"Pragmatic Reshuffles" by root - Proposal 4739 adopted 5/5
  The Deckmastor is required to Reshuffle only when a prerequisite condition
    is correctly announced.

"Skunks smell, but at least the odor goes away after a week" by root - Proposal
    4764 adopted 5/24
  The six-month delay on Skunks is tied, not to wins, but to true announcements
    of a win or Skunk.

"Takeover fix?" by Eris - Proposal 4745 sanitized 4/24 - Proposal 4751 adopted
    5/5
  Submitting a Takeover Proposal makes all other Takeover Proposals
    undistributable and removes them from the pool.

"Tenure Time" by root - Proposal 4768 adopted 5/24
  Rename "Assistant Director of Personnel" to "Associate Director of
    Personnel".  As opposed to "International Assistant Director of
    Personnel", which would have been truer to the TV series, but
    apparently the University is angling to take control of all Offices.

          most; in case of ties, they all get it)

"Feexins" by Maud - Proposal 4783
  A feection is a notice of intent to perform a fee-based action.
  Players performing an action with a fee of zero need not announce the fee.
  Fees are natural numbers (which may or may not include zero, but a CFJ would

    would retroactively nullify its own play.

"Soft Ruleset Limits" by Sherlock - see also "Hard Ruleset Limits"
  If there are >(Rules Threshold) rules (Rules Threshold may be set by Speaker
    once per term), adoption of proposals increasing the number of rules
      (option 1) is ineffective.
      (option 2) dings the author with the Class 2 Crime of Improper Rules
        Fattening.

"SotU's Ephemera" by Quazie - Proposal 4771 failed quorum 5/24 - Proposal 4788
  The Secretary of the University may award this ephemeral Patent Title at
    the end of each month:

          from the Library)

"The Asafoetida Revue" by Maud - Proposal 4779 failed quorum 5/24 - Proposal

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Begone, Speaker-elect" by Goethe
  Replace Speaker-Elect with Pope.
  A cardinal is an active ready player other than the Speaker and Assistant
    Director of Personnel.
  There can be at most one pope, who must be a cardinal.
  The Assistant Director of Personnel shall announce the pope as soon as
    possible.  Upon a correct and still-current announcement, the pope
    becomes Speaker and ceases to be pope.
  The Assistant Director of Personnel shall announce a rule-required conclave
    as soon as possible, thus convening it.  The rule may specify a subset of
    eligible cardinals (default is all).  At most one conclave may be in
    progress at once.
  During the first 7 days of a conclave, any cardinal may announce eir intent
    to become pope, and any other player may support em.
  As soon as possible after the first 7 days, the ADoP shall announce that the
    eligible cardinal with the most unwithdrawn support becomes pope (the ADoP
    breaks ties), or if no eligible cardinal has support, that the conclave
    was inconclusive.  This announcement concludes the conclave, and (if it was
    inconclusive) convenes a new one.
  A cardinal who Wins may become pope by announcement within 7 days.  If two
    or more cardinals Win simultaneously, then a conclave convenes with only
    them eligible.
  If no pope has become Speaker within the past six months, or a pope ceases
    to be pope without becoming Speaker, then a conclave convenes.
  Upon a successful Rebellion, a conclave convenes with only rebels eligible.
  If the Speakership is vacated voluntarily, or due to inactivity or
    Lawlessness, then a conclave convenes.

"Card Contracts" by Goethe
  Increase the power of Rules 1742 (Agreements), 2107 (Contracts), and 2109
    (Agoran Contracts) to 2.
  All players are members of Agoran Contracts, regardless of consent.
  Deckmastor requirements are rolled into Rule 2068 (The Deckmastor).
  The Deckmastor's Budget is split into a separate rule.
  Maximum Deck Size (initially 100, minimum = number of players times maximum
    hand size).  The Deckmastor may, with 2 support, reduce quotas so that
    their sum equals the Maximum Deck Size.
  Maximum Deck Diversity (initially 30, minimum = number of players times
    two).  The Deckmastor may, with 2 support, reduce quotas to zero so that
    the number of cards with non-zero quota equals the Maximum Deck Diversity.
  Maximum quota (unique -> 1, rare -> number of players).  A player may, with
    2 support, reduce a card's quota to its maximum.
  A Cardbook is a Contract between the Deckmastor and Agora with "Cardbook"
    in its name.  Cardbooks may define Cards and Card Elements.
  Cards and Card Elements are moved to the Twopower Cardbook or Onepower
    Cardbook, with power of 2 and 1 respectively.  There is also a Nopower
    Cardbook for Blueprints.  A player may (with 1 support) add or remove a
    Blueprint, or (if the Blueprint is at least a week old, and without 3
    objections) increase a Blueprint's quota to the minimum for its frequency.

"chaos resolution" by Maud
  A request to invoke the Agoran Sidestep (arbitrary changes to the gamestate)
    is valid only if:
      * the rules cannot be otherwise modified, or it cannot be determined in
          reasonable time whether the rules can be otherwise modified
      * all active players support and none object
      * the resulting rules and gamestate would be agreed upon by all players
      * 7 to 28 days have elapsed since the request was published
  at which point the invoker may invoke it by announcement.

"Deckmastor Contract" by Manu
  Move Cards and Card traits into a Contract between the Deckmastor and Agora,
    and empower it to define those things.

"Final Adoption index" by Quazie
  At the end of a proposal's voting period, its Adoption Index is increased to
    its Voting Index (if the latter is greater).

"Fluid Precedence" by Maud
  Mwamuzi is an Office.
  Mchawi is an integral Index, default 10000; the Mwamuzi may (without
    objection) increase it.
  Daraja is an integral Index from 0 to Mchawi.
  A rule's default Daraja is Mchawi - (Power * Rule Number).
  In rule conflicts, the rule with greater Daraja takes precedence.  In cases
    of equal Daraja, the existing methods of resolution are applied.
  A player may spend Hila to alter a rule's Daraja by an equal amount.

"Have we fixed voting yet?" by Goethe
  Proposal 1953 (Sane Proposals) has its Power increased to 3.
  All proposals with AI >= 3 are Sane.
  Flipping a player's noisiness to quiet has a 7-day delayed effect, cancelled
    if e posts to a Public Forum first.
  Repeal Takeover Proposals, Voting Potential, and the Guillotine.
  Voting Power on Democratic Proposals is same as for Sane Proposals (specified
    in an easy-to-amend clause).
  Cancelled votes are explicitly without effect on success/failure or quorum,
    but must be reported.

"How to Join Agora" by Maud
  Readiness and Grace Periods are rolled into Rule 1677 (Honoring the New).

"New Foundations, Part I" by Maud

    inconsistent requirements.

  Rule 107 (Rule Changes Must Be Written Down -> The Official Publicity Act)
    requires communication, without reference to written/electronic media.
  Repeal Rule 1583 (Proposal Penalties Halved for New Players).

"New Foundations, Part II" by Maud
  Ballots are attempted votes; valid ballots are votes.
  Only player-submitted ballots are valid, and only one per player per
    proposal.
  A proposal achieves quorum if at least one-third of all players who were
    active and noisy at the start of its voting period submitted ballots that
    were valid at the end of its voting period.

          4/18-27   Assigned to Riail, who is recused
          4/27-5/5  Assigned to root, who judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  root named a player and card, but did
            not explicitly use any form of the word "choose".
          Judge's argument (summary):  "choose", "name", "indicate", "select",
            "designate", and "determine" are all synonyms.  There is no
            indication that Agora explicitly re-defines any of them, or
            explicitly requires that "choose" be used.

CFJ 1550  "When a proposal is aborted, all votes cast on it are canceled."
[FALSE]   4/18     Called by root; part of Linked CFJs 1549-53
Appealed  4/18-21  Assigned to OscarMeyr, who judges FALSE
          4/24-26  Appealed by Maud, Eris, Sherlock, and Goethe
          4/26     Appeal assigned to Murphy, Maud, and Kolja
          5/3      Murphy judges SUSTAIN
          5/3      Maud judges REMAND
          5/5      Michael's attempt to judge REVERSE is ineffective because
                     eir assignment was incorrect
          5/20     Kolja recused, Manu assigned
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 106 (Adopting Proposals) requires
            proper proposals to be voted upon, which may prevent the
            cancellation of all votes.

CFJ 1560  "The Justiciar's report was not ratified in 2003."
[TRUE]    4/27      Called by Sherlock
          4/27-5/4  Assigned to OscarMeyr, who judges TRUE
          5/4       Appealed by root
          Caller's argument (summary):  The Justiciar's report did not exist
            in 2003.  Some of its information was part of the Notary's report
            in 2003, and the weekly Notary's report was ratified then, but the
            monthly Notary's report was not; the Justiciar's report is closer
            to the latter.
          Judge's argument (summary):  Rule 1791 (Ratification Without
            Objection) explicitly connects ratification to the Officer.

CFJ 1561  "The Library can not receive Boons and/or Patent Titles"
[TRUE]    4/29   Called by Manu
          5/3-8  Assigned to Goethe, who judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 649 (Patent Titles) defines a
            Patent Title as "a legal item of recognition of a person's
            distinction", and explicitly states that only persons may bear
            them.  Boons are a subset of Patent Titles.

CFJ 1562  "A cancelled vote on a Proposal does not count towards quorum."
[TRUE]    5/3    Called by Goethe
          5/3-5  Assigned to Michael, who judges TRUE and grants Goethe's
                   motion to annotate Rule 879 (Quorum)
          Caller's argument (summary):  Based on standard English definitions,
            cancelling a vote makes it invalid and/or ineffective, or perhaps
            changes its value to something that is not a vote on a Proposal.

CFJ 1563  "Goethe possesses a Discard Picking card."
DISMISS   5/5     Called by Sherlock
          5/8-14  Assigned to OscarMeyr, who DISMISSes it
          Commentary:  Goethe played Discard Picking to draw Not Your Turn,
            then played Not Your Turn to retroactively cancel eir play of
            Discard Picking and eir draw of Not Your Turn.
          Judge's argument (summary):  This is indeed a paradox, thus cannot
            be found true or false.

CFJ 1564  "Goethe possesses a Not Your Turn card."
DISMISS   5/5     Called by Sherlock
          5/8-15  Assigned to Murphy, who DISMISSes it
          Commentary:  See CFJ 1563.

CFJ 1565  "The holder of power of attorney for a player who is not the
           speaker may deregister that player."
          5/12  Called by Maud
          5/15  Assigned to Quazie
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1841 (Granting Power of Attorney)
            attempts to prohibit this, but may be overruled by Rule 101 (Obey
            the Rules) which permits players other than the Speaker to
            deregister.

CFJ 1566  "Eris is guilty of Delay of Game after Quazie played Your Turn
[FALSE]    indicating Eris."
          5/13     Called by Quazie
          5/15-22  Assigned to root, who judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1016 (Activity Levels) prevents
            inactive players from being required to act, but Your Turn does
            not explicitly require action (it merely penalizes inaction).
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Rule 1503 (Crimes and Infractions)
            says that an action or inaction is a Crime or Infraction only if
            defined as such by the rules.  Your Turn is not worded as "a
            player commits the Infraction by failing to do X", but rather "a
            player must either do X or commit the Infraction".  It fails to
            define any action or inaction as being the Infraction, so there
            is in fact no such Infraction.

CFJ 1567  "If Sherlock has a One Share card, then Goethe errored in good
           faith in determining the cards to deal, and the errors did not
           greatly change the probability of the cards that were selected."
          5/20  Called by Goethe
          5/25  Assigned to Manu

CFJ 1568  "root is Noisy."
          5/22  Called by OscarMeyr
          5/25  Assigned to Michael
          Caller's argument (summary):  root claimed to make emself quiet, but
            simultaneously made emself noisy by posting to a Public Forum.

5/5   Deckmastor Goethe confirms the Library's win.
