CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

*** Rule 1567 causes ineligibility by request to expire after one month ***

CFJ 1449 "The Proposal entitled 'Full Discretion Fix' would have been
[TRUE]    Rubberstamped by the message sent by Cecilius today under the
Appealed  subject line 'Rubberstamping, Take Two,' if that Proposal had not
          already been Rubberstamped."
         Linked to CFJ 1448
         3/3     Called by Cecilius
         3/9-17  Assigned to Goethe, who Judges TRUE
         3/20    Appealed by Steve, Sir Toby, and Pakaran
         3/20    Appeal assigned to Steve, Eris, and Pakaran
         3/24    Steve moves to overturn and reverse
         3/31    Eris moves to overturn and remand
         Judge Steve's refutation (summary):  Transfers (even of 0)
           require a valid Notice of Transfer, and a Notice of Transfer
           for 0 cannot be valid.
         Commentary:  A Rubberstamped Proposal may be Rubberstamped again.

CFJ 1461 "One or more tax debts of one or more bouncy balls were created as
[FALSE]   a result of a message sent by root on May 27, 2003."
         5/26    Called by root
         6/5-20  Assigned to Eris, who Judges FALSE
         Caller's argument (summary):  The first tax notice may have been
           invalid because it did not include "everyone else: zero" in the
           required list of currency holdings and tax debts.  If it was
           invalid, then a judgement of FALSE should be returned.

CFJ ???? "Murphy is the vote collector in the election for Registrar."
         6/7  Called by Murphy
         Caller's argument (summary):  The title of vote collector may have
           moved with the office of ADoP, which changed hands during the
           nominating period.
