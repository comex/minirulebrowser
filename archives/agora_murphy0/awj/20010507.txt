ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Assistant Director of Personnel" by Murphy - Proposal 4142 adopted 4/15
  Duties of the Grand Warden of the Oligarchy pertaining to Offices are
    transferred to this new Office.  The GWotO remains responsible for the
    Oligarchy.
  The current GWotO becomes the initial ADoP, but not its Electee.  The Office
    of GWotO also ceases to have an Electee.

"Bank Loans" by Blob - Proposal 4144 adopted 4/22
  The Bank may buy Bonds for Stems, at rates specified in the Usuror's Budget
    and dependent on the face value and time-to-maturity of the Bonds.
  The Credit Limit is an amount of Stems from 0 to 1000.  No Player may sell
    Bonds to the Bank equivalent to more than this amount of Stems.
  The Treasuror may, With Support, stop or start the Bank from buying Bonds.

"Becoming Parliamentary" by Goethe - Proposal 4146 adopted 4/22
  A Group may become Parliamentary if at least two members are not in eir Grace
    Periods, and
      (a) It has existed continuously for at least one month, and has Voted on
          at least one Democratic Proposal; or
      (b) It was formed before May 1, 2001.
  This is a supplement to "Better Democracy Through Groups"; see below.

"Mentor's Bonus" by Blob - Proposal 4143 adopted 4/22
  During the four weeks after the end of a Player's Grace Period, the Player
    (if not a Zombie) may award a Mentor's Bonus to one other Player.

"More Ways to Win (redux)" by Murphy - Proposal 4138 adopted 4/15
  An Insane Proposal getting no FOR Votes is worth a Win.

"Points Adjustments" by Wes - Proposal 4141 adopted 4/15
  Points are explicitly not possessed, hence not Property.
  Points awards/penalties are "ineffective" rather than "invalid" if they do
    not meet certain requirements.
  Patent Titles are worth 5 Points again, but only if not held by the same
    Player within the previous week.
  Degrees are worth Points only if not held by the same Player previously.
  Distributor is no longer a Patent Title.

"Restore our Sanity!" by Ziggy - Proposal 4139 adopted 4/15
  Rule 1953 (Sane Proposals) takes precedence over the Rules that determine
    normal Voting Power.

"The Speaker, Sanity and insane bidding wars" by Ian - Proposal 4145 adopted
4/22
  The Speaker may only make Interested, non-Contested Proposals Democratic.
  Proposals made Democratic by the Speaker are also made Sane, and the
    Distribution Cost is increased accordingly.  For the change to be made
    during the Voting Period, someone must first pay the difference in
    Distribution Cost.
  A Player may, With 3 Supporters, Contest a Proposal that could be made
    Democratic by the Speaker.  Doing so costs 0.1 VE.
  Players may pay VEs for or against a Contested Proposal.  At the end of the
    Voting Period, if more VEs were paid for than against, then the Proposal
    becomes Democratic.  (Ties cause a change only if the Player who Contested
    the Proposal was the Speaker and Untainted.)

"Yet Another Cleanup Proposal" by Wes - Proposal 4140 adopted 4/15
  A Judge who dismisses a CFJ is paid a normal Judicial Salary, rather than a
    hard-coded amount of 20 Stems.
  Salaries and the Treasuror's Budget are no longer limited to "wage-earning"
    Offices.

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

"Fix insane bidding wars" by Ian - Proposal 4149 failed quorum
  This is a supplement to "The Speaker, Sanity and insane bidding wars"
    (Proposal 4145); see above.
  "Contested" is renamed to "Attacked".
  Lists of conditions and effects are expressed in convenient list form.

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Ambiguous Ordering Fix" by Elysion - Proposal 4150 failed quorum 5/2 and
became Democratic
  An attempt to make multiple simultaneous communications, not explicitly
    ordered, fails if any two specific orderings would result in substantively
    different gamestates.

"Criminal Simplification" by Murphy - Proposal 4152
  General restrictions on the identity, reporting, and penalizing of Crimes and
    Infractions is streamlined into a single Rule.
  A Notice of Infraction shall explicitly specify the Infraction, committer,
    Rule(s) defining it, action/inaction, and Orders to impose the penalty;
    these Orders shall be vacated if a COE on the commission is admitted.

"Finally, pragmatic Currencies" by Steve (Proposed by Ian, presumably so as to
recover Distribution Cost upon adoption)
  Property transfers unauthorized by the Rules are no longer generally
    ineffective, but the Property must be returned; failure to do so is the
    Class 10 Crime of Receiving Stolen Property.
  Making an intentional unauthorized Property transfer from the Bank is the
    Class 10 Crime of Embezzlement.

"Group Votes revised" by Michael - Proposal 4153
  For Democratic Proposals, Groups with three or more members have Voting Power
    equal to the number of Players divided by the number of such Groups.

"Help New Players" by harvel
  New Players become Unready at the beginning of eir Grace Period, and Ready at
    the end of it.
  An Unready Player may become Ready by saying so.
  Rule 698 (Always an Eligible Judge) explicitly asserts its power to command
    Inactive Players, and extends eligibility to the Caller as a last resort.
  An Unready Player does not appear in the Order of Succession to the
    Speakership.
  Ordering an Unready Player to Formally Apologize for violating a Rule is
    optional.
  An Unready Player may expunge half of any Blots e receives.
  The New Player Award is part of the Treasuror's Budget.
  All Players currently in their Grace Period become Unready.
  All Players who registered on or after September 21, 2000, with a Grace
    Period, receive the New Player Award.

"Inflationary Patronage" by Kelly - Proposal 4151 failed quorum 5/2 and became
Democratic
  The Speaker's Patronage is half the Basic Officer Salary.

"Keep it Quiet" by harvel
  A Player is never more than one of Noisy/Quiet/Silent.

"Minor CFJ adjustment" by Wes
  When a CFJ is reassigned, the new Judge is selected based on eligibility at
    the time of reassignment.

"Oligarchic Orthodoxy" by Elysion
  Rebels shall be removed from the Oligarchy.

"Points Contests" by Goethe
  A Points Contest is one whose ACO says so.
  A Player may not join a Points Contest if e has been a member of one during
    the past four weeks.
  Each month, each Points Contest that existed at the beginning of that month
    may award Points to one or more Contestants, totalling at most five times
    the number of Contestants it had at any time during the past two weeks.

"Poor Man's Agora" by Syllepsis
  A Sanctimonious Player is all of the following:
    * an Immaculate Senator
    * neither a Zombie nor a Zombie Master
    * possesses no VEs, and at most 4 x BOS in Stems
    * controls no other entity (other than the Bank or Monastery) possessing
        Zombies, VEs, or Stems
  A Player Sanctimonious for at least a week may become a Monk.
  A Monk reported as non-Sanctimonious for at least 48 hours ceases to be a
    Monk at the beginning of the next week.
  At the beginning of the month, or while there is no Abbot, the Stem-poorest
    Monk (ties broken randomly) becomes Abbot, Executor of the Monastery.
  The Monastery may give away its VEs, as long as it keeps at least five.
  For Democratic Proposals, the Voting Power of the Monastery is one plus the
    number of VEs it holds.
  Any Monk may make a Proposal Democratic, With 3 Monk Supporters.
  Any Player or set of Players may make a Proposal Democratic by giving 0.3 VEs
    to the Monastery.

"Rebels and Roles" by Goethe
  A Player loses eir Role (if any) upon becoming Rebellious.

"Rebel Tax Seizure" by Goethe
  Rebels are taxable.  However, if a Rebel pays tax, and a Revolt succeeds
    before e becomes Abiding again, then the Bank must return eir payment.

"The Whole Truth" by Kelly - Proposal 4148 failed quorum 5/2 and became
Democratic
  A Player may be convicted of Perjury or Misrepresentation only if e willfully
    made a false statement of fact.  Specifically:
      * E must intend to make a false statement of fact.
      * E must realize that the statement e makes is false.
      * Excusable negligence, reasonable error, and reasonable reliance on the
          representations of another are defenses.
      * A conclusion as to the interpretation or application of the Rules is
          not a "statement of fact".
  Falsification is merged into Misrepresentation.

"What is Public?" by Wes - Proposal 4147 failed quorum 5/2 and became
Democratic
  Discussion Fora are defined.  Messages sent to one are deemed not to have
    been sent to all Players.
  An announcement that a medium becomes / ceases to be a Public Forum or
    Discussion Forum must be made via all existing Public Fora.
  All other Rules mentioning a/the Public Forum are rewritten using "publicly".

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Another Use for Indulgences" by Elysion
  A Player may change Roles after three months for free, after six weeks by
    paying one Indulgence, or immediately by paying three Indulgences.

"Communications Decency Act" by Blob
  <The summary of this Proto-Proposal has been deleted for security reasons.
   Please consult the E-Scribe agora-business archive for April 17, 2001.>

"Fix 'Complacent Oligarchy'" by Steve
  When an Ordinary Proposal fails quorum, the Assessor shall publish a Notice
    of Complacency, which puts a Democratic Distributable copy back into the
    Pool (so it gets reported as part of a normal Proposal Distribution).
  Publishing a Notice of Complacency for an Ordinary Proposal that achieved
    Quorum is the Class 2 Crime of Sending It Back Where It Don't Belong.

"Make the Speaker's Gratuity more gratuitous" by Murphy
  The Speaker's Gratuity is paid to any Player who was Speaker for at least 12
    days of a month.

"Ministries" by Goethe
  Each Role may have an associated Ministry, whose members are all Players who
    have that Role.
  The Office of Minister without Portfolio tracks Roles and Ministries.
  For Democratic Proposals, each Ministry has a Voting Power of 16 (if AI=1),
    8 (if AI=2), 4 (if AI=3), or 2 (if AI=4 or more).  Each member has one
    Ministry Vote; the Ministry's Votes are cast FOR or AGAINST the Proposal,
    depending on whether the FOR/AGAINST ratio of Ministry Votes is greater
    than or equal to the AI of the Proposal.
  Acolytes belong to the Priesthood, Scribes belong to the University, and
    Politicians belong to the Congress.

"Tag, You're It!" by Blob
  At most one Player is It.  If no Player is It, the Speaker may make a random
    Player It.
  It may tag another Active Player by announcing it within 30 minutes of that
    Player posting to the Public Forum, upon which that Player becomes It.
  Tagging the Player who tagged you is the Class 0.5 Infraction of Getting the
    Butcher Back.
  Being It for more than a week is the Class 0.5 Infraction of Being Too Slow,
    and causes the offender to cease to be It.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1279  "Proposal 4112 is Democratic."
[FALSE]   2/21      Called by Murphy
Appealed  2/26-3/2  Assigned to pTang, who Judges FALSE
          3/3-5     Appealed by Murphy, Taral, and Elysion
          3/30      Appeal assigned to lee, Steve, and Wes
          4/5       Steve and lee move to overturn and reassign
          4/7       Wes is automatically recused
          4/8       Wes attempts to move to overturn and reassign; eir
                      automatic recusal had been overlooked
          4/8       Mistakenly reassigned to Hooloovoo
          4/13      Hooloovoo (attempts to) proto-Judge FALSE
          4/13      Wes replaced by Razl on Board of Appeals
          4/15      Hooloovoo attempts to Judge FALSE
          4/20      Razl is automatically recused
          5/4       Razl replaced by Crito on Board of Appeals
          5/4       Crito moves to overturn and reassign
          5/5       Reassigned to Ziggy
          Caller's argument (summary):  If CFJ 1278 is false, then so is this;
            otherwise, while Proposal 4111 is adopted too early to place a
            requirement on the Assessor to announce Proposal 4112's failing
            quorum, it may still cause Proposal 4112 to become Democratic upon
            the Assessor's announcement.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Assessor t's announcement that
            Proposal 4112 failed quorum was not required by Rule 1965, so it
            was not "such an announcement" to cause Proposal 4112 to become
            Democratic.
          Board of Appeals grounds for overturning (summary):  There are three
            possible readings of "such an announcement" (of failed Quorum) in
            Rule 1965:  any announcement, an announcement required by the
            Rules, and an announcement required by Rule 1965 itself.  pTang
            failed to consider the second possibility.  Also, due to the
            partly-switched information in the relevant announcement by
            Assessor t, it may be that Proposal 4112 failing Quorum was
            announced before Rule 1965 was created.

CFJ 1289  "The ACO submitted by Tim to create the contest 'Agora the Beautiful'
[FALSE]    is invalid."
          4/18     Called by Razl
          4/21-27  Assigned to Goethe, who Judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Tim's ACO says "A Contestant ... may
            not cease being a Contestant until the Contest has ended".  Rule
            1553 allows Contestants to quit at any time.  Rule 1553 also
            invalidates ACOs in conflict with the Rules.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Either the clause in question is
            directed solely at person(s) other than the Contestant emself, or
            the Contestant may escape the clause by withdrawing eir consent to
            be bound by the Contest's SLC, or the Contestant voluntarily
            forfeits Rule 1553 protection by consenting to join the Contest.

CFJ 1290  "Goethe is a Contestant in the Agora the Beautiful Contest."
          4/27  Called by Goethe
          5/2   Assigned to Ian
          Caller's argument (summary):  Goethe has made several statements
            which the Contest equates with consent to join, but e has neither
            explicitly consented nor explicitly denied consent to join.

CFJ 1291  "The Clerk of the Courts, Wes, has broken Rule 991, 'Invoking
           Judgement."
          5/3  Called by Goethe
          5/3  Assigned to lee
          Caller's argument (summary):  Wes announced the identity of the Judge
            of CFJ 1290 while omitting most of the Caller's evidence.

CFJ 1292  "Kelly cast a nonzero number of Votes on Proposal 4139."
          5/4  Called by Kelly
          5/4  Assigned to Oerjan, who proto-Judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Kelly attempted to cast 0.5 Votes
            AGAINST Proposal 4139.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Rules 683 and 1715 indicate that Votes
            must be cast in integral quantities.
