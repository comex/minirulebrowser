ERRATA
------


ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Clarify Judicial Rotation" by Murphy - Proposal 4584 failed quorum 6/20
-
    Complacent Corporation - Proposal 4596 adopted 7/3
  The Clerk of the Courts' Report of May 31 is ratified.
  Rule 1550 is renamed "Ratification by Proposal".
  Mass-unturning only occurs when an open CFJ has no Trial Judge and no
one
    eligible to be assigned, and the Clerk of the Courts publishes a
Notice
    of Rotation specifying at least one such CFJ.

"Creating the Framework for Cards" by Wes - Proposal 4571 failed quorum
5/2 -
    Complacent Oligarchy - Proposal 4573 adopted 5/14
  The Deckmastor tracks Cards and their ownership.
  The Deckmastor's Budget contains the Maximum Hand Size (an integer
from 3
    to 10).
  The Deckmastor is Executor of the Deck, but may only cause it to act
as
    specified by the rules.  The Deck may not transfer cards unless
required.
  When required by the rules, the Deckmastor shall create or destroy
Cards
    by announcing the Card and its owner.
  Players and other rule-specified entities are Gamblers (may own
Cards).
  Unowned Cards are automatically transferred to the Deck.
  An entity's Hand is the set of eir Cards, and eir Hand Size is the
number
    of Cards in eir Hand.
  Each class of Card has a Caption (name), a Quota, zero or more
Elements, and
    zero or more Exploits.  Cards of the same class are fungible.
  Each class of Card should have exactly (Quota) instances.  If not,
Cards are
    created or destroyed as needed.  (The Deck's Cards are destroyed
first,
    followed by randomly selected instances.)
  Each Element has a rule-defined name and description.  All cards with
an
    Element behave according to its description.
  An Exploit is an action that the holder can take, after which the card
    returns to the Deck (unless a rule says otherwise).  "Playing a
card"
    means using one of its Exploits.
  Cards may be transferred by announcement.
  "Discarding a card" means transferring it to the Deck.
  "Drawing a card" means drawing it from the Deck.
  An entity may draw a card (for a Fee equal to the number of times e
has
    previously done so this month) if it is permitted to hold Cards, and
if
    eir Hand Size (including pending draws that the Deckmastor has not
yet
    processed) would not exceed the Maximum Hand Size.  The Deckmastor
shall
    randomly select one of the Deck's cards for each draw.
  Elements:
    * Budgeted (Quota is part of Deckmastor's Budget, default 3)
    * Handed X (counts as X cards toward Hand Size)
    * Restricted X (only entities of type X may use Exploits)
    * Limited X Y (entities not of type X must pay a Fee of Y to use
Exploits)
    * Persistant (not returned to Deck after it is used)
    * Bleed X (holder loses X points per week)

"Fix Hot Potato" by Sir Toby - Proposal 4585 failed quorum 6/20 -
Complacent
    Corporation - Proposal 4597 adopted 7/3
  Change "with 48 hours" to "within 48 hours".

"Fix Nominating with Budgets" by Murphy - Proposal 4578 failed quorum
6/14 -
    Complacent Corporation - Proposal 4589 adopted 7/3
  Proto-budgets are no longer tied to the voting period (which
single-nominee
    elections don't have), but to the ends of the nominating period and
the
    overall election.  The gamestate is retroactively repaired to
account for
    past elections affected by this bug.

"Fix Non-Judicial Separation" by Murphy - Proposal 4586 failed quorum
6/20 -
    Complacent Corporation - Proposal 4594 adopted 7/3
  Whenever the Speaker is Electee to Assistant Director of Personnel, e
is
    retired.
  The Assistant Director of Personnel cannot be nominated for
Speaker-Elect.

"Fixed Stalled Proposals" by Elysion - Proposal 4590 adopted 7/3
  Stalled Proposals are Undistributable (on top of their current state
of
    "may not be distributed").

"Judicial Separation" by Murphy - Proposal 4577 failed quorum 6/14 -
    Complacent Corporation - Proposal 4592 adopted 7/3
  Whenever a player is both Clerk of the Courts and Justiciar, e is
removed
    as Justiciar.  (Previously, this only occurred if e was Justiciar
first.)
  Nominees for Clerk of the Courts may not be nominated for Justiciar.
  The Speaker, Justiciar, and nominees for Justiciar may not be
nominated for
    Clerk of the Courts.
  The Clerk of the Courts and Justiciar may be nominated for
Speaker-Elect,
    but are still retired if they become Speaker (and are Electee).

"Judicial Tweaks" by Murphy - Proposal 4579 adopted 6/14
  If one or more of the Speaker, Clerk of the Courts, Justiciar is
ineligible
    to be an Appellate Judge, replacements are chosen at the discretion
of the
    Clerk of the Courts, rather than randomly.
  If a Trial Judge is recused from one or more Linked CFJs, they remain
linked
    to each other, but not to any other CFJs to which e is still
assigned.
  If a turned player is assigned as a judge by mistake, and the Clerk of
the
    Courts makes a new assignment before the judge returns judgement,
then the
    mistaken assignment is cancelled.
  Unready players are directly ineligible to judge, rather than relying
on
    keeping them continuously turned.
  Non-noisy players are ineligible to become a judge (but remain
eligible to
    judge anything to which they are already assigned).

"Oligarch in a Three-Piece Suit" by root - Proposal 4576 adopted 5/31
  Oligarchs are replaced by Shareholders, i.e. holders of Stock cards. 
Each
    Shareholder's Voting Power on Ordinary Proposals is the number of
Shares
    e has.
  Stock cards include One Share (initial quota 3), Two Shares (initial
quota
    2), and Three Shares (initial quota 1).
  New card - Corporate Bankruptcy - all Stock Cards are discarded (fee
of 3
    Kudos).
  A Plebeian is a non-Shareholder.  The Corporation is the set of
Shareholders.
  Duties and conditions of the Grand Warden of the Oligarchy regarding
the
    Speaker are transferred to the Assistant Director of Personnel.

"Sweeping it under the rug, take three" by Murphy - Proposal 4582
adopted 6/14
  Retroactively repair the gamestate to account for an error in tracking
    Steve's Voting Power during October and November 2003.

"Wacky Cards" by Wes - Proposal 4572 failed quorum 5/2 - Complacent
Oligarchy
    - Proposal 4574 adopted 5/14
  Classes of Cards:
    * ZOT! (Quota 1; Handed 3; reduce an entity's points by X*10 points
for a
        fee of X; cannot make an entity's points negative)
    * Oligarch of the Day (Quota 1; Restricted Senators; Oligarch for
rest of
        day)
    * Albatross Flies Away (Quota 1; Limited Immaculate 3; revoke one of
your
        Albatrosses)

for
        88 hours)
    * Hot Potato (Quota 1; Persistant; transfer to another entity, if
they
        don't announce "Hot Potato" within 48 hours then you can ding
them
        for the Class 1 Infraction of Dropping the Potato)
    * It's a Surprise! (Quota 1; Handed 2; draw two cards for free)

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Card Discard and Draw Piles" by Sir Toby
  Replace the Deck with the Draw Pile and Discard Pile.
  Draws come from the Draw Pile.

"cards are ugly" by Goethe

    Budget, but only changeable via proposal) and incorporated into the
    Rules by reference.

"Devolve Now!" by Goethe
  Parts of the ruleset are split out into Quasi-Authoritative Canons
(QUACKs)
    incorporated into the Rules by reference.
  Each QUACK has a Khodja (Notary by default) required to publish it
weekly,
    and one or more Precepts.
  Each Precept's Power is the minimum of the Rule defining its QUACK and
the
    Power (if any) that its QUACK assigns to it.
  Each Precept is treated as if it were a Rule with the same Power, and
the
    same number as the Rule defining its QUACK.  Conflicts between
same-Power
    Precepts in a single QUACK are resolved based on the QUACK's
numbering
    of Precepts.

    announcement.
  If a non-deck gambler with a hand size of at least twice the Maximum
Hand
    Size receives a card, e is assigned a Pending Reduction; the Dealor
    shall discard a random card from that gambler's hand, or (if that is
not
    possible) it may cancel a pending draw.

"Fix Team Wins, Mark II" by Murphy
  When one Team Wins, no other Team may Win until that Win is announced,
and
    scores are not reset until that Win is announced.

"ILCs" by Elysion
  An Independent Legal Code (ILC) is a body of law under an authority
other
    than the Rules, and defined by the Rules as an ILC.
  ILCs are deemed to be Subordinate Legal Codes.

"Melds" by OscarMeyr

in
    which the requirements arose, causing material difference in the
combined
    outcome, is the Crime of Stacking the Deck (unless the Rules require
    another order).

<untitled> by Eris
  Bleed cards cannot be played by players with zero points or less.

CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

*** Rule 1567 causes ineligibility by request to expire after one month
***

5/20  RedKnight requests to be ineligible to judge CFJs pertaining to
cards

5/27  root requests to be ineligible to judge CFJs assigned between May
27
        and June 6, 2004

6/27  Maud requests to be ineligible to judge CFJs

7/4   Maud requests to be ineligible to judge CFJs

CFJ 1497  "If a person who is a player of both Agora and Claustronomic
[TRUE]     ceases to be a player of Agora, then e also ceases to be a
Appealed   player of Claustronomic."
          4/8       Called by Maud
          4/8       Assigned to Murphy, who judges TRUE
          4/8       Appealed by Maud, Eris, and Goethe
          4/10      Appeal assigned to Sherlock, Eris, and Michael
          4/10      Eris moves to REMAND
          4/13      Michael moves to REMAND
          4/24      Sherlock is recused
          4/29-5/4  Appeal assigned to OscarMeyr, who moves to REMAND
          5/4       Reassigned to Murphy
          Caller's argument (summary):  C-as-a-nomic does not equate
"player
            of C-as-a-nomic" with "member of C-as-an-Agoran-contest", so
the
            statement should not be judged TRUE.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Regardless of C-as-a-nomic's
stance,
            Agora defines membership based on C-as-an-Agoran-contest.
          Appellant Maud's argument (summary):  But the last clause of
the
            statement asked about "player of C-as-a-nomic", not about
"member
            of C-as-an-Agoran-contest".

CFJ 1498  "No two Rules may legally have the same Title."
[FALSE]   4/12     Called by Wes
          4/18-21  Assigned to Sir Toby, who judges FALSE
          4/21     Appealed by root, Elysion, and Wes
          4/21     Appeal assigned to Goethe, Murphy, and RedKnight
          4/28     Murphy moves to REMAND
          4/29     RedKnight moves to SUSTAIN
          4/30     Goethe moves to SUSTAIN
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rules are Rule-defined
entities.  Rule
            Titles are names.  Rule 1586 (Definition and Continuity of
            Entities) applies.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Not all Rule-defined entities
have
            names.  Rules are not required to have names.  Rules do not
have
            names.  Nothing else prevents two Rules from having the same
Title.
          Appellate Judge Murphy's argument (summary):  "Name" and
"title" may
            be ordinary-language synonyms, so Rule 754 (4) may apply.  A
rule's
            title may include zero or more of ("Rule", number, title).

CFJ 1499  "Rule 2050 has been repealed."
[FALSE]   4/20  Called by Goethe
          4/20-29   Assigned to Eris, who makes emself ineligible
          5/2-16    Assigned to Pakaran, who is recused

                      OscarMeyr (S')

          6/29      RedKnight is recused
          7/3-4     Appeal assigned to root (J'), who moves to REVERSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 2050's self-repeal is a
rule
            change (Rule 105), and was not voted on or adopted, so Rule
107
            prevents it from taking effect.
          Commentary:  Rule 107 does not explicitly prohibit the Rules
from
            changing themselves, even without any voting or adoption.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Non-proposed rule changes are
            generally effective, but this one is specified by the Herald
            who is not an Instrument with sufficient Power.
          Counterargument:  This rule change is triggered by the
Herald's
            announcement, but specified by Rule 2050 itself.
          Appellate Judge root's argument (summary):  This rule change
is
            specified by both the Herald's announcement and Rule 2050. 
Rule
            1322 only examines instruments, and Rule 2050 meets its
Power
            requirement.

CFJ 1500  "Goethe is a Politician."
[TRUE]    5/3     Called by Goethe
          5/4-12  Assigned to Michael, who judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Goethe was a Politician when the
            definition of "Politician" was repealed.  Either e remains a
            Politician, or eir subsequent statement "I permit myself to
            be a politician" made em a Politician (Rule 101).
          Judge's argument (summary):  "Politician" has its
ordinary-language
            meaning, and Goethe (elected to Agoran office and
participating
            in its political aspects) fits the definition.

CFJ 1501  "All Players who are Electee to one or more Offices are
DISMISS    Politicians."
          5/16     Called by Murphy; part of Linked CFJs 1501 - 1504
          5/22-31  Assigned to Maud, who judges DISMISS
          Judge's argument (summary):  "Politician" has its
ordinary-language
            meaning, but "Electee" and "Office" do not.  The former is
not
            necessarily implied by the latter.

CFJ 1502  "All Players are Politicians."
[FALSE]   5/16     Called by Murphy; part of Linked CFJs 1501 - 1504
          5/22-31  Assigned to Maud
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Maud is not a Politician.

CFJ 1503  "At least one of (Kolja, Maud, Sherlock, Sir Toby, Wes) is a
DISMISS    Politician."
          5/16     Called by Murphy; part of Linked CFJs 1501 - 1504
          5/22-31  Assigned to Maud, who judges DISMISS

CFJ 1504  "At least one of (Cainech, Oerjan, Pakaran, Steve, t) is a
DISMISS    Politician."
          5/16     Called by Murphy; part of Linked CFJs 1501 - 1504
          5/22-31  Assigned to Maud, who judges DISMISS

CFJ 1505  "root successfully played the Hot Potato card on Sunday, May
16
[TRUE]     2004."
          5/18       Called by root; part of Linked CFJs 1505 - 1509
          5/22-31    Assigned to t, who is recused
          5/31-6/14  Assigned to Sherlock, who is recused
          6/15-20    Assigned to Murphy, who judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  root performed the action in the
            Hot Potato's Exploit.  E did not specify that e was playing
            the card, but such specification may be unneeded.
          Judge's argument (summary):  Yes, it is unneeded.

CFJ 1506  "The Deckmastor is not empowered to post messages on behalf of
[TRUE]     the Deck."
          5/18       Called by root; part of Linked CFJs 1505 - 1509
          5/22-31    Assigned to t, who is recused
          5/31-6/14  Assigned to Sherlock, who is recused
          6/15-20    Assigned to Murphy, who judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  The Rule "The Deckmastor"
prohibits
            the Deckmastor from acting on behalf on the Deck except as
            explicitly permitted by the Rules.  No Rule permits em to
post
            messages on behalf of the Deck.  Also, CFJ 1303 sets
precedent
            that an entity's Executor cannot post on behalf of the
entity.
          Commentary:  Actually, CFJ 1303 sets precedent that "I post as
if
            I were <entity>" is ineffective, but does not set precedent
for
            "I post on behalf of <entity>".
          Judge's argument (summary):  The Deckmastor is required (hence
            permitted) to transfer and announce on behalf of the Deck to
            satisfy pending draws, but there were no pending draws at
the
            time of this CFJ.

CFJ 1507  "Goethe's delegation of the Deckmastor Office to Wes on
Tuesday,
[FALSE]    May 18 2004 extended the deadline of the Deck's requirement
to
           post the phrase "Hot Potato" to "as soon as possible" after
the
           delegation."
          5/18       Called by root; part of Linked CFJs 1505 - 1509
          5/22-31    Assigned to t, who is recused
          5/31-6/14  Assigned to Sherlock, who is recused
          6/15-20    Assigned to Murphy, who judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Delegation extends the deadline
of
            requirements placed on the Office.  However, this
requirement
            is placed on the Deck.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  The Deckmastor is Executor of
the
            Deck, but is not required to cause the Deck to fulfill its
            obligations; e is merely penalized if it fails to do so. 
Since
            the requirement is not placed on the Office, delegation does
not
            extend the deadline.

CFJ 1508  "The Deck is guilty of the class 1 Infraction of Dropping the
[TRUE]     Potato."
          5/18       Called by root; part of Linked CFJs 1505 - 1509
          5/22-31    Assigned to t, who is recused
          5/31-6/14  Assigned to Sherlock, who is recused
          6/15-20    Assigned to Murphy, who judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  If the Deckmastor is not
empowered
            to post on behalf of the deck (see CFJ 1506), then the Deck
has
            committed the Infraction, and is not protected by Rule 2039
            because it is not a person.

CFJ 1509  "Goethe is the Prime Executor of the Deck with respect to the
the
[FALSE]    requirement to post "Hot Potato" to a public forum as a
result
           of root's play of the Hot Potato card on Sunday, May 16
2004."
          5/18       Called by root; part of Linked CFJs 1505 - 1509
          5/22-31    Assigned to t, who is recused
          5/31-6/14  Assigned to Sherlock, who is recused
          6/15-20    Assigned to Murphy, who judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  The Deckmastor is the Prime
Executor
            of the Deck.  Goethe was Deckmastor when the requirement
arose,
            but Wes was Deckmastor when the time limit expired.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  The rules don't check the
identity
            of the Prime Executor until the penalty arises.

CFJ 1510  "Riail currently possesses one or more Debate-O-Matic cards."
[TRUE]    6/21      Called by root
          6/26-7/4  Assigned to Eris, who judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Debate-o-Matic cards are
ineffective
            because they are not instruments with a power of at least 2
(as
            required by Rule 1933).  Does Riail still count as having
            performed the Exploit, thus discarding eir Debate-o-Matic?
          Judge's argument (summary):  Playing exploits is independent
of
            intent, so Riail's intent to play this exploit is
irrelevant.  The
            action was not performed, so the card was not discarded.
          Commentary:  Failure of first-order effect (e.g. an exploit
says
            "do X" but you can't do X) means that the action was not
            performed.  Failure of higher-order effects (e.g. an exploit
says
            "do X", you do X, but X can't have side effect Y) means that
the
            action was performed.

CFJ 1511  "Proposal 4588 is Democratic."
          6/25  Called by Goethe; part of Linked CFJs 1511 - 1513
          6/26  Assigned to Michael
          Caller's argument (summary):  Is a Debate-o-Matic capable of
            changing a proposal's chamber?

CFJ 1512  "Proposal 4588 is in its voting period."
          6/25  Called by Goethe; part of Linked CFJs 1511 - 1513
          6/26  Assigned to Michael
          Caller's argument (summary):  If the Debate-o-Matic changed
the
            chamber of Proposal 4588, then what happened to its voting
            period?  Rule 2021 does not apply, since the chamber was
            changed by a method other than paying the Chamber Fee.

CFJ 1513  "Riall holds a Debate-o-matic card."
          6/25  Called by Goethe; part of Linked CFJs 1511 - 1513
          6/26  Assigned to Michael
          Caller's argument (summary):  If the Debate-o-Matic failed to
            change the chamber of Proposal 4588, then does Riail still
            count as having performed the Exploit, thus discarding it?

CFJ 1514  "Murphy's Voting Potential is 42."
          7/4  Called by Murphy
          Caller's argument (summary):  The fee for increasing Voting
            Potential depends on the Political Charge, but the
definition
            of Political Charge has been repealed.  If it is zero, then
            this statement is true.

CFJ 1515  "Murphy's Voting Potential is 1."
          7/4  Called by Murphy
          Caller's argument (summary):  The fee for increasing Voting
            Potential depends on the Political Charge, but the
definition
            of Political Charge has been repealed.  If it retains its
value
            prior to the repeal, then this statement is true.

distributes
        cards in an order such that It's a Surprise! is frequently the

that
        e gets it back after each time e plays it.)

      root plays Hot Potato (implicitly, by transferring it to the
