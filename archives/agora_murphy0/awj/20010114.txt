ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Adjust Elections" by Murphy - Proposal 4103
  Terms of Service expire on the 15th of the month, not the 1st.
  Elections must be initiated as soon as possible after an Office comes to be
    without an Electee.

"Alternate Adoption System" by Elysion - Proposal 4104
  All Proposals have an Adoption Index of 1, but (if adopted) a Power equal to
    their Voting Index.  For instance, if a Proposal attempts to amend both a
    Power=1 Rule and a Power=2 Rule, and it is adopted 7 FOR to 6 AGAINST (thus
    a Voting Index of 7/6), then the first amendment succeeds but the second
    fails.

"Billing winning bidders" by Steve - Proposal 4094
  Rather than creating "liabilities" by announcing winning Bids, the Auctioneer
    simply bills for them.

"Clarify Resignation with Successor" by Murphy
  A successor must consent within one week of being named, and eir consent has
    no effect if the Office acquires an Electee in the meantime.

"Compensate for Complacent Oligarchy" by Murphy - Proposal 4101
  If an Ordinary Proposal fails Quorum, then it becomes Democratic and goes
    through another week of Voting.

"Fixing Rule 1840" by Elysion - Proposal 4096
  If an Inciting to Riot penalty is postponed due to a Revolt whose results
    remain undetermined, and the Revolt succeeds, the penalty is cancelled.

"Making Stems Transferrable" by Blob - Proposal 4095
  Stems may be freely transferred.

"More Ways to Win" by Murphy - Proposal 4102
  Not being Immaculate is a Win-Preventing Condition.
  Being the only Immaculate Player is a Win Condition.  Upon such a Win, the
    Herald shall expunge N Blots per Player, where N is just enough to make at
    least one other Player Immaculate.
  An Insane Proposal distributed but receiving no FOR Votes is a Win Condition.

"Scores" by t - Proposal 4097
  Winning a contested Election is worth 15 Points, not 10.  Losing a contested
    Election is worth 7 Points if you receive at least many Votes as there were
    Candidates.  However, for the purpose of both of these awards, Candidates
    receiving no Votes are omitted.
  No penalty from resigning from an Office.
  Adoption of one's Proposal is worth 9 Points minimum, plus 29 if you have
    never had a Proposal adopted before.
  1 Point for a Proposal that attains Quorum but receives exactly X times as
    many FOR as AGAINST Votes, where X is the Proposal's Adoption Index.
  Being the only Player to Vote FOR or AGAINST a Proposal is worth 4 Points,
    not 10.

"Settle the Oligarchy" by Steve
  Peekee becomes a Low Oligarch.

"Spelling Fixes, Part 1 of 2" by Murphy - Proposal 4099
  Fix typos in the following Rules:
  Rule 1926 (The Official Secrets Act)
  Rule 1727 (Happy Birthday)
  Rule 1948 (Zombie Transfer Tax)
  Rule 1789 (Cantus Cygneus)
  Rule 1755 (No Non-Player Responsibilities)
  Rule 1431 (Claims of Error)
  Rule 1764 (Modes of Voting)
  Rule 1434 (Default Procedure for Referendum Voting)
  Rule 1810 (Noncompliance with Orders)
  Rule 1812 (Notices of Infraction)
  Rule 1369 (Theses)
  Rule 1370 (How to Get a Degree)
  Rule 1579 (Mintors)
  Rule 1917 (General Currency Taxation)
  Rule 1598 (Property Transfers)
  Rule 1887 (Default Procedure for Auctions)
  Rule 1924 (Living Twice Shall Have Its Price)
  Rule 1446 (Contests)

"Spelling Fixes, Part 2 of 2" by Murphy - Proposal 4098
  Fix spelling errors in Rules 1664 (Rebellion) and 1937 (Filling Vacancies in
    the Oligarchy).

"The Dole" by Murphy - Proposal 4100
  Players may go On The Dole, forfeiting eir Minimum Income to automatically
    expunge a Blot per month.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Simplify Blots, Part 1 of 2" by Murphy
  Rule 1435 (Definition of Indulgences, Blots, and Immaculate) is simplified:
    * Individual Rules requiring or allowing changes in Blots no longer need
      specify how the change must be reported to the Herald.  Instead, they
      need only specify the entity required or allowed to perform the change,
      and that entity's Executor must report it to the Herald.
    * Provision for removing Blots with Indulgences moved into a new Rule.
  Rule 1885 (Zombie Auctions) is simplified:
    * Simpler language, generally.
    * Removed explicit report-it-to-the-Herald text.
    * Zombies with <1 Blot subject to same 1-Indulgence Starting Bid as
      Immaculate Zombies.
  Rules 1747 (Pardoning Lawlessness) and 1439 (Blots Due to a CFJ) simplified
    by removing explicit report-it-to-the-Herald text.

"Simplify Blots, Part 2 of 2" by Murphy
  No effect unless Part 1 adopted within the previous week.
  Rule 1664 (Rebellion) simplified by removing explicit report-it-to-the-Herald
    text.

CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1252  "Peekee has a Will."
[FALSE]   11/7    Called by Peekee
          1/6-13  Assigned to Chuck, who Judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Peekee had a Will when Wills last
            ceased to be defined by the Rules.  Now Wills are once again
            defined by the Rules.  Is "Peekee's Will" still an entity?  If so,
            is it once again a Will?
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Wills ceased to exist when they ceased
            to be defined, and Proposal 4082 (re-defining Wills) contained no
            provision for bringing previous Wills back into existence.

CFJ 1253  "Novalis and Harlequin are not Zombies."
[FALSE]   11/16   Called by Andre
          1/6-12  Assigned to Crito, who Judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  The Zombies have sent messages to the
            Public Forum (e.g. to Vote), which makes them cease to be Zombies.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  The PF messages are sent by the
            Zombies' Executors, not the Zombies themselves.

CFJ 1254  "Peekee possesses at least one Voting Token."
          11/20  Called by Murphy
          1/6    Assigned to David
          Caller's argument (summary):  Murphy attempted to create a Voting
            Token and transfer it to Peekee.
          Counterargument (summary):  Even if the creation succeeded, the
            Voting Token cannot be possessed or transferred, because the Rules
            do not explicitly define it as being Property.

CFJ 1255  "Rule 1586 should be interpreted such that the Rule created by
[FALSE]    Proposal 4090 (Debt Conversion) has no effect, since any
           outstanding debts and liabilities in Basic Currencies were
           canceled when Basic Currencies were abolished from the Rules."
          12/8    Called by Oerjan
          1/6-13  Assigned to Elysion, who Judges FALSE
          Counterargument (summary):  Only the Currencies themselves were
            abolished; debts referring to those Currencies continued to exist.

CFJ 1257  "Peekee is an Oligarch."
[TRUE]    12/18   Called by Murphy
          1/8-12  Assigned to Kelly, who Judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  While Peekee paid eir bid late, e still
            paid it, and thus became an Oligarch.

CFJ 1258  "Peekee is the Notary."
          12/18  Called by Murphy
          1/8    Assigned to lee
          Caller's argument (summary):  Notary ceased to be an Office on 5/8,
            at which time Blob held it.  Had it remained an Office, a
            subsequent Election would have transferred it to Peekee.  Can that
            alleged Election be interpreted as effective anyway?


OFFICES/OLIGARCHS
-----------------

1/7   Elections begin for Assessor, Herald, Promotor, Speaker-Elect, and
        Treasuror.

      Speaker Murphy delegates Office of Promotor to Elysion, pending consent.

ERRATA
------

Peekee became an Oligarch on 12/17/00 [CFJ 1257], thus High Oligarch Elysion
  lost eir position on 12/15/00 [Rule 1938], hence the announcement on 12/31/00
  of an Oligarch Auction did not actually cause an Auction because it did not
  correctly state the number of items up for Bid [Rule 1887 (e)].
