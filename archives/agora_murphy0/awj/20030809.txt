ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Default noteworthiness" by Goethe - Proposal 4520 adopted 7/29
   Entities that would otherwise have undefined Kudos default to 1 Kudo.
   New Players get Kudos equal to half the Tabla Rasa (rounded up), unless
     they are subject to a Grace Period (why?) or have already been through
     at least one Turning of a New Parchment since registering.
   Goethe has 1 Kudo.

"Generalize Ratification" by Murphy - Proposal 4517 adopted 7/17
   The definition of "valid to ratify" no longer depends on ratification by
     proposal.
   Ratification by proposal is effective if the document is valid when the
     proposal takes effect.  (Validity of the document at any prior moment
     no longer matters.)

"Spelling Fix" by Murphy - Proposal 4516 adopted 7/17
   Fix "emphemeral" in Rule 1664.

     Goethe's failure to become an Oligarch) - Complacent Oligarchy

"Mornington Crescent" by Murphy - Proposal 4518 failed quorum 7/29 (due to
     Goethe's failure to become an Oligarch) - Complacent Oligarchy

player switches.
   Convert Depth (Distributable/Undistributable) and Interest into proposal
     switches.
