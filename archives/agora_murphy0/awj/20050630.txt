  The Deckmastor's Budget is split into a separate rule.

    hand size).  The Deckmastor may, with 2 support, reduce quotas so that
    their sum equals the Maximum Deck Size.
  Maximum Deck Diversity (initially 30, minimum = number of players times
    two).  The Deckmastor may, with 2 support, reduce quotas to zero so that
    the number of cards with non-zero quota equals the Maximum Deck Diversity.
  Maximum quota (unique -> 1, rare -> number of players).  A player may, with
    2 support, reduce a card's quota to its maximum.
  A Cardbook is a Contract between the Deckmastor and Agora with "Cardbook"
    in its name.  Cardbooks may define Cards and Card Elements.
  Cards and Card Elements are moved to the Twopower Cardbook or Onepower
    Cardbook, with power of 2 and 1 respectively.  There is also a Nopower
    Cardbook for Blueprints.  A player may (with 1 support) add or remove a

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

"Agoran Contracts Fix I" by Manu - Proposal 4776 failed quorum 5/24 - Proposal
    4793 rejected 6/6
  Agoran Contracts are tracked by the Registrar, not the Assistant Director
    of Personnel.
  Agoran Contracts may exist between
    * two or more entities (part of the Justiciar's Report)
    * an Office and Agora (part of the Assistant Director of Personnel's
        Report)
    * an entity and Agora (part of the Registrar's Report; all players are
        members)
  Agoran Contracts may only be created or amended by Sane Proposals, and may
    also be repealed by them.

    one's proposals being adopted.

"Deckmastor's Ephemera" by Quazie - Proposal 4772 failed quorum 5/24 - Proposal
    4789 rejected 6/6
  The Deckmastor may award these ephemeral Patent Titles at the end of each
    month:
      * BestPlay (top contributor to Card play)
      * IgnorantGamer (dynamic/albatross; player whose draws/plays failed the
          most; in case of ties, they all get it)

"Glub Glub" by Murphy - Proposals 4730, 4731, 4732 (identical text) failed
    quorum 5/2
  Attempted Town Fountain type scam, relying on non-scammers having Voting
    Power on Democratic Proposals of zero (due to broken Sente) and cancelled
    votes still having to be counted (debated via CFJ; cancelled votes were
    decided not to count toward quorum, at least).

"Looting the comatose" by Quazie - Proposal 4773 failed quorum 5/24 - Proposal
    4790 rejected 6/6
  Loot the Dead may target inactive players.

"Mirror, Mirror" by Sherlock - Proposal 4809 rejected 6/20

    reversed in effect.

"Oscar Night" by Goethe and Steve - Proposal 4816 failed quorum 6/30
  Nth Anniversary Ribbons are replaced with an Agoran decision to choose the

    to choose the Best Rule award.  Options are any version of a rule since

"Regulations Precedence" by Manu - Proposal 4775 failed quorum 5/24 - Proposal
    4792 rejected 6/6

    lower-numbered Regulations taking precedence.

    rejected 6/6

      * Studious (two copies to the player who checked out the most Cards
          from the Library)

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Complacency Kills Proposals" by Goethe
  Repeal Rule 1965 (Complacent Corporation), now that everyone has a vote on
    Ordinary Proposals.

"Dud Raffle" by Goethe
  Repeal Raffle Tickets, replacing existing copies with Duds.
  Raffles are triggered by a new card Lotto (Asleep [61]), rather than
    occurring quarterly.

"Feexins" by Maud - Proposal 4783 rejected 6/2 - resubmitted without the terms
    "feections" and "Throwing the Gauntlet" (but with some missing words) as
    Proposal 4806 rejected 6/20 - resubmitted by root (with the missing words
    restored) as "Feexin' Feexins"
  A feection is a notice of intent to perform a fee-based action.
  Players performing an action with a fee of zero need not announce the fee.
  Fees are natural numbers (which may or may not include zero, but a CFJ would
    probably find that it does in this case).
  Challenging a feection due to insufficient kudos is Throwing the Gauntlet.

"Omnibus Spelling Fix" by Maud
  "nonwithstanding" -> "notwithstanding":
    2059 (Legality of Bonus Clauses)
    2078 (Takeover Proposals)
  "Appelate" -> "Appellate":
     911 (The Board of Appeals)
    1570 (Announcement of Appeal)
    1447 (Final Judgement upon Appeal)
    2026 (Appelate Determinations; also in title)
    1693 (Appeal of a Judgement)
  "commonsense" -> "common sense":
     217 (Judgements Must Accord with the Rules)
  "maintainance" -> "maintenance":
    1670 (The Distributor)
  "transfering" -> "transferring":
    2069 (Card Definitions)
  "existant" -> "existent":
    1370 (How to Get a Degree)
  "Write" -> "Writ":
    1789 (Cantus Cygneus)
  "losses" -> "loses":
    2084 (Cash Cards)

"PH'NGLUI" by Manu
  Amend the Map of Agora by replacing the mauve-colored whale with the Island
    R'lyeh.  ("Oh no, not again.")

"the Fortinbras Repeal" by Goethe
  Quietness is merged into inactivity.  A player may (with support and without
    2 objections) make another player inactive, if they have not posted in 30
    days; such inactivity is automatically reversed if the player posts again,
    similar to noisiness.
  Repeal the card "Loot the Dead".

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

(untitled) by root
  Requirements of contract regulations are not considered rule requirements
    for any purpose other than actually requiring members to obey them.

"Affiche Rouge" by Manu
  Patent Titles are awarded by the Herald, rather than the Herald reporting
    Platonic awards.
  Duplicate Unique Patent Titles are revoked by the Herald.

"Boonds and Switches" by Maud
  "Recordkeepor" is abstracted.
  Viscosity is a switch switch with values loose, stuck, and static (cannot be
    flipped at all).
  Documentation is a switch switch with values tracked and untracked.  The
    recordkeepor of a class of entities is also the recordkeepor of that
    class's tracked switches.
  Switch switches are untracked and static by default.
  Karma is a static switch.
  Worth is a stuck ephemeral-patent-title switch with values 1 and all other
    natural numbers.  This is the magnitude of its effect on kudos upon the
    Turning of a New Parchment.
  Players may transfer eir boons to other players.
  Players may convert their kudos into trinkets (boons of equal worth).

"Chaos Potato" by root
  The Deckmastor shall publish a random reordering of the lines of the
    Onepower Cardbook, which is adopted a week later unless each player
    who voted for this proposal publishes a formal apology first.

"Ecumenical Proposals" by Maud
  The Envoy shall maintain a list of friendly nomics and their members.  E may
    add nomics; any player may remove a nomic with 3 support, after which the
    Envoy needs that player's support to re-add that nomic.
  Ecumenical is a proposal chamter.  Members of friendly nomics have a vote on
    ecumenical proposals, but members of Agora have two votes.

"Embed Voting Indices in S^1" by Maud
  Calculate Voting Index as lim (A -> AGAINST) FOR/A.

"I am made of Poison" by Maud
  New card element Gotcha (exploit is performed only by transferring card to
    another player, the Mark; implies Persistent).
  Hot Potato is simplified by using this, and the delay is increased from 48
    to 72 hours.

"Return of the Son of Property Magnate" by Maud
  Property is anything ownable.  The creation, destruction, and transfer of
    property is regulated.
  Worth is a stuck property switch with values 0 and all other natural numbers.
  A player may destroy eir property.  E gains an albatross if it was a card,
    plus another one if it was a card checked out from the library.
  A player may transfer eir property.
  A player may create a trinket (property) for a fee equal to its worth.
  A player may redeem a trinket; e gains kudos equal to its worth, and it is
    destroyed.  If e mis-reports its worth, the Herald may give em an
    albatross.

"The Chaos Potato" by Goethe
  Chaos Apple is changed from Delayed (7) to Asleep (32) and Persistent, and
    auto-played upon transfer (if not Asleep).
  Chaos Reborn is repealed.
  Persistent is changed from "is not transferred to the Deck" to "is not
    transferred to the Discard Pile".

"The Viridian Repeals" by Maud
  A player may petition the Justiciar to expunge blots for a Formal Apology or
    community service.  The Justiciar may (with support and without 2
    objections) approve.  After a month and completion of the promised act,
    the Justiciar may expunge the blots.
  Each crime has one or more Monitors (players authorized to report it), and
    ticketing orders for suspicion (vacated upon a judgement of innocence).
  Monitors may be authorized to impose punishment, typically a range of blot
    values.  Judges may impose different punishments.
  A crime may only be cited within its prescriptive period, typically a
    fortnight.
  The Lizard (player accused of a crime) has a week to plead innocent, guilty,
    or no contest.  If e pleads innocent, or e fails to plead to a crime
    without intent as a component, then the Monitor may impose punishment,
    and the case is closed.  Otherwise, the case is handled similarly to a
    CFJ alleging the commission of the crime.  The Lizard may select an
    Advocate (with eir approval).
  If a crime has intent as a component, then a player is immune to prosecution
    if e reasonably believed eir (in)action was not a crime when it occurred.
  If a crime consists in part of failing to act, then a player is immune to
    prosecution if e was not empowered to perform that act.
  Existing crimes are adjusted to use this structure, replaced with direct
    blots or albatrosses, or repealed.
  Improper Officer Transition:  The ticketing order is an order to assist the
    new officeholder as soon as possible.

"Welcome All Coauthors" by Maud
  Non-players may be coauthors.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

Requests for ineligibility:

6/15  Sherlock (CFJ 1572)
6/15  OscarMeyr (CFJs "for the rest of this month")

CFJ 1453  "As a result of the formation of root's Pay Out Scam Contest (rPOSC),
[TRUE]     the Bank incurred a debt to root consisting of one or more
Appealed    properties."
           3/4/03   Called by root
           3/10-17  Assigned to t, who makes emself ineligible
           3/20-24  Assigned to Sir Toby, who Judges TRUE
           6/16/05  Appealed by root, Maud, and Goethe
           6/19     Appeal assigned to Murphy, Maud, and Michael
           Caller's argument (summary):  The Contest required root to pay out
             Property to emself, and Rule 1594 (Violation of SLCs) requires em
             to obey the Regulations.  Since Rule 1594 requires em to pay out
             Property, Rule 1479 (Definition of "Pay Out" and "Bill") causes
             the Bank to incur a debt.
           Judge's argument (summary):  This is backed up by game custom that
             Orders requiring paying-out create debts because they are also
             backed by Rule 1594.
           Counterargument (summary):  SLCs and similar entities do not
             empower in the same way that they restrict.  This appeal will
             provide an analogy for Cardbooks, Contracts, and Agreements.

CFJ 1550  "When a proposal is aborted, all votes cast on it are canceled."
[TRUE]    4/18     Called by root; part of Linked CFJs 1549-53
          4/18-21  Assigned to OscarMeyr, who judges FALSE
          4/24-26  Appealed by Maud, Eris, Sherlock, and Goethe
          4/26     Appeal assigned to Murphy, Maud, and Kolja
          5/3      Murphy judges SUSTAIN
          5/3      Maud judges REMAND
          5/5      Michael's attempt to judge REVERSE is ineffective because
                     eir assignment was incorrect
          5/10     Kolja defaults
          5/20     Kolja recused, Manu assigned
          6/3      Manu judges SUSTAIN
          6/3      Appealed by Goethe, Maud, and Eris
          6/12     Appeal assigned to Murphy, Maud, and Goethe
          6/17     Goethe moves to REVERSE
          6/18     Maud moves to REVERSE
          6/19     Murphy moves to SUSTAIN
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 106 (Adopting Proposals) requires
            proper proposals to be voted upon, which may prevent the
            cancellation of all votes.
          Second appeals board's refutation (summary):  Rule 106 uses "voted
            upon" in the sense of Agora as a whole going through a voting
            period, regardless of whether any individual votes are cast and/or
            cancelled.

CFJ 1565  "The holder of power of attorney for a player who is not the
[FALSE]    speaker may deregister that player."
          5/12     Called by Maud
          5/15-29  Assigned to Quazie, who defaults
          6/3-13   Assigned to Goethe, who judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1841 (Granting Power of Attorney)
            attempts to prohibit this, but may be overruled by Rule 101 (Obey
            the Rules) which permits players other than the Speaker to
            deregister.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Prime Executorship does not transfer
            control of all actions.
          Commentary:  Executorship does transfer control of all actions, and
            is not derived from Prime Executorship, but vice versa.  However,
            the CFJ is now moot, since Power of Attorney has been repealed.

CFJ 1567  "If Sherlock has a One Share card, then Goethe errored in good
[TRUE]     faith in determining the cards to deal, and the errors did not
           greatly change the probability of the cards that were selected."
          5/20     Called by Goethe
          5/25-27  Assigned to Manu, who judges TRUE

CFJ 1568  "root is Noisy."
[TRUE]    5/22  Called by OscarMeyr
          5/25  Assigned to Michael, who judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  root claimed to make emself quiet, but
            simultaneously made emself noisy by posting to a Public Forum.
          Judge's argument (summary):  Players can only make other players
            quiet by announcement, not emselves.

CFJ 1569  "Manu successfully transfered a Kudo from a Contract to emself at
[FALSE]    least once."
          5/25   Called by Manu
          6/3-8  Assigned to Maud, who judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 2047 (Kudos) says that a player's
            kudos may only be changed as specified by the rules, or by an
            instrument of Power >= 2.  The existence and effectiveness of
            Regulations is specified by the rules, so they can change a
            player's kudos.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  The contents of rule-specified bodies
            of text are not themselves rule-specified.

CFJ 1570  "The legality of at least one of the transfers referenced by
[TRUE]     Goethe in the first message submitted as evidence cannot be
           determined with finality, as required by the rule 'Win by
           Paradox'."
          6/4      Called by root; part of Linked CFJs 1570 - 1571
          6/12-17  Assigned to Sherlock, who judges TRUE
          Judge's argument (summary):  Such determinations would depend on
            the judgements of CFJs 1563 and 1564, which were dismissed due to
            inability to find them true or false.

CFJ 1571  "The orders executed by Goethe in the second message submitted as
[TRUE]     evidence are improper."
          6/4      Called by root; part of Linked CFJs 1570 - 1571
          6/12-17  Assigned to Sherlock, who judges TRUE
          6/17     Goethe vacates the orders in question, in case e had not
                     already done so
          Judge's argument (summary):  The time limit of 73 hours is
            unreasonably short for such a recently initiated argument.

CFJ 1572  "The phrase 'no Votes were cast AGAINST it' in rule 2095 should
[TRUE]     be interpreted as 'any vote cast AGAINST it either was cancelled
           or at the end of the voting period had a vote value besides
           AGAINST'."
          6/6      Called by Maud
          6/12-15  Assigned to Sherlock, who makes emself ineligible
          6/19-26  Assigned to Murphy, who judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 683 (Voting on Proposals) does
            not specify, but Rule 955 (Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal)
            assumes so, and it is in the best interest of the game that Rule
            2095 (The Assessor's Boon Duties) be interpreted so.
