ERRATA
------

Proposal 4614 (No Point Anymore) did not take effect on September 21 because
  some votes were reported incorrectly.  It took effect on October 10 when a
  correction was issued.


ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Cards for Proposals" by OscarMeyr - Proposal 4635 adopted 1/23
  When a proposal is adopted, the proposer gains a pending draw.  Hand limit
    applies only if the proposal was disinterested.

"Fix Shareholder Errors" by Murphy - Proposal 4637 adopted 2/19
  The voting results for Proposals 4627-4630, 4633, and 4635 are ratified.
  Voting results for all issues (not just Referenda and Elections) are
    ratified if not challenged within a week.

"Penalties for Stock Cards" by Goethe - Proposal 4638 adopted 2/19
  One Share becomes Handed[2].
  Two Shares becomes Handed[3].
  Three Shares becomes Handed[4].

"Pragmatic deals" by Goethe - Proposal 4633 adopted 1/9
  If the Deckmastor errs in good faith in choosing a card to deal, and the
    probability of choosing that card is not greatly changed, then the deal
    stands.

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

"Clarify Ineffectiveness" by Murphy - Proposal 4636 rejected 1/30
  Naughty proposals are not implemented, even if adopted (but may trigger
    Rule-based side effects).
  Proposals attempting to change votes, or offer bribes for voting FOR or
    AGAINST, are naughty.

"December Power Play" by Goethe - Proposal 4632 rejected 1/9
  Takeover Proposal.  Corporate Raiders are Maud, Michael, Pakaran, Sir Toby,
    RedKnight, and Sherlock.

"For the Fairest" by Eris - Proposal 4634 rejected 1/23
  Takeover Proposal.  Corporate Raiders are Maud, Michael, Pakaran, Sir Toby,
    RedKnight, and Sherlock.
  Repeal Rule 2029 (Town Fountain).

"Is this a takeover?" by Goethe - Proposal 4639 rejected 2/19
  Takeover Proposal.  Corporate Raiders are all players with a Coalition card.

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"clean up the card rules" by Quazie
  Individual cards are moved to Rule 2067 (Cards in Play):
    * Everything in Rules 2071 (Wacky Cards), 2076 (Card cards), 2077
        (Democratic cards), and 2079 (Discord)
    * Shares from Rule 1932 (Shareholders and the Corporation)
  Card elements are moved to Rule 2070 (Card Powerz):
    * Shares from Rule 1932 (Shareholders and the Corporation)
    * Grafty from Rule 2059 (Legality of Bonus Clauses)
  Creating a new card or card element outside these respective rules is the
    Crime of 52 Card Pickup.

"Fix Winning" by root - Proposal 4644
  Pending draws gained from Rule 2080 (Cards for Proposals) are deemed not
    to have been gained until now.  A redundant no-fee clause is removed from
    the rule.
  If the Deckmastor incorrectly processes post-win conditions, then gamblers
    are still un-frozen, but the Deckmastor commits the Crime of Stacking the
    Deck if the error was not in good faith.

"Grafty is not a bribe, for the fourth time" by Quazie - Proposal 4640
  The Card element Grafty does not trigger Rule 1561 (Illegality of Bonus
    Clauses).

"How my garden grows" by Quazie - Proposal 4643
  All active non-quiet players receive a Daffodil five days after this
    proposal is adopted, unless the Herald has repealed Rule 2050 (The
    Garden) first.

"Install OscarMeyr as Registrar" by Murphy
  What, the title isn't clear enough for you?  Honestly.

"Late Announcement of Elections for Offices" by Murphy
  The result of an office election is still effective if announced late,
    unless another election for that office has already started.

"Saving Throw vs. Failed Saving Throw" by root - Proposal 4641
  Proposal 4623 (Vote Cards) is retroactively exempted from Rule 1561
    (Illegality of Bonus Clauses).

"The Rimmer Experience" by Murphy - Proposal 4642
  New Patent Titles (Three/Six/Nine/Twelve) Months Long Service, for holding
    an office continuously for that long.  Each player only gets one of each.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"a few new card ideas" by Quazie
  New Card element Sticky (may not be discarded unless frozen).
  New Card Greedy Bastard (gain a kudo and an albatross).
  New Card Charity Brings Happiness (give a kudo to a poorer player, gain a
    boon).
  New Card Thieves in the Night (Delayed[5]; if less than half of non-Deck
    gamblers have this card, and the target does not have it, then take a
    kudo from em; otherwise, gain an albatross for each false condition).
  New Card My bank is open for business (Persistent, Sticky, Handed[0]; each
    possession, after two days, a player may take a kudo from you).
  Hot Potato becomes Sticky.

"Card Contests" by root
  The Deckmastor may (without objection) name Contests as Card Contests.
  The Deckmastor's Budget includes the Prize Limit.
  A Card Contest's Regulations may define one or more classes of Prize Cards,
    and may award up to the Prize Limit once a month.  If the definition
    changes, then it ceases to be a Card Contest (but the Deckmastor may
    make it one again).

"Clarify Ineffectiveness, Mark II" by Murphy
  Blocked proposals (coercive, bribing, or vetoed by the Speaker) cannot
    achieve quorum (and are thus always rejected).

"Fix Corporate Takeovers" by Murphy
  Corporate Raiders must include the submitter of the proposal.
  Players no longer lose Sente at the beginning of the voting period.
  Non-Corporate Raiders gain Sente if the proposal fails quorum.

"More extensive Takeover fix" by Goethe
  New Card element Asleep (same as Delayed, except you are limited by anyone
    playing the card recently, not just yourself).
  New Card Hoist the Flag (Asleep[45]; a proposal becomes a Takeover).
  Corporate Raiders must include the submitter of the proposal.
  Players no longer lose Sente at the beginning of the voting period.
  Non-Corporate Raiders gain Sente if the proposal fails quorum.
  New Card Not Your Turn (Budgeted, Delayed[2], retroactively undo a card play
    and prohibit that Gambler from playing it again for two days).

"Patch Card Wins, #1" by OscarMeyr
  Pragmatize the effects of a win; they do not occur until the Deckmastor
    carries them out.

"Pendings Pending" by Goethe
  Pending draws gained from Rule 2080 (Cards for Proposals) are deemed not
    to have been gained until now.  A redundant no-fee clause is removed from
    the rule.

"Proto fix to 2050" by Quazie
  Give the Herald and eir announcement repealing Rule 2050 (The Garden)
    sufficient Power for the repeal to be effective, for the two-second
    time period centered on the time of the announcement.

"Take Cards Out" by Goethe
  All Card definitions are moved from the Rules to external documents (Hoyle
    One and Hoyle Two), part of the Deckmastor's monthly report, and are
    incorporated into the Rules by reference (and may only be amended as if
    they were part of the referencing Rules).


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

Requests for ineligibility:

2/14  RedKnight (involving cards)
2/22  Maud (all)

CFJ 1527  "Goethe has nine Pennies."
[FALSE]   12/14       Called by root
          12/19-1/12  Assigned to Murphy, who is recused
          1/16        Assigned to OscarMeyr
          Caller's argument (summary):  One of the Pennies would have been an
            effect of the adoption of Proposal 4618, which may have been
            without direct effect (see CFJ 1526) and also indirect effect
            (which would make the statement false).

CFJ 1528  "Proposal 4639 was a Takeover Proposal when its voting period
[FALSE]    ended."
          2/14     Called by Goethe
          2/20-26  Assigned to OscarMeyr, who judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  The Corporate Raiders were "every
            player holding a Coalition Card", which changed during the voting
            period.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Proposal 4639 ceased to be a Takeover
            Proposal when its list of Corporate Raiders ceased to be valid.

CFJ 1529  "Goethe was a Corporate Raider when Proposal 4639's voting period
[FALSE]    ended."
          2/14     Called by Goethe
          2/20-26  Assigned to OscarMeyr, who judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  The Corporate Raiders were "every
            player holding a Coalition Card", which changed during the voting
            period.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  When Proposal 4639's voting period
            ended, it was not a Takeover Proposal (see CFJ 1528) and thus had
            no Corporate Raiders (regardless of whether Goethe was part of its
            then-invalid list).

CFJ 1530  "Quazie's Hand is Free."
[TRUE]    2/16     Called by Goethe
          2/20-22  Assigned to Manu, who judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Quazie registered during a card
            freeze period, but was not affected by the freezing event at the
            beginning of that period.

CFJ 1531  "Proposal 4639 was Aborted."
          2/27  Called by root
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 2078 (Takeover Proposals) says
            that Takeover Proposals are both Democratic and Sane.  When
            Proposal 4639 ceased to be a Takeover Proposal (see CFJ 1528),
            it may have ceased to be Democratic as well, in which case it
            was aborted by Rule 1933 (A Proposal's Chamber) for having its
            chamber changed.
