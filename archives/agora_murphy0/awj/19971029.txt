RECENT CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT

* October 23:

CFJ 1014 "This statement is TRUE."
         Dismissed by Michael per Rule 1565 (iii)
CFJ 1047 "General Chaos committed the Crime of Wrongful COE Denial."
         Previously Judged TRUE
         Justiciar elJefe moves to overturn/reverse

* October 25:

CFJ 1060 [paraphrased] "Ross Morgan-Linial did not transfer a Kudo
                        from Harlequin on <date>."
         Judged FALSE by General Chaos

* October 26:

CFJ 1014 Dismissal published
CFJ 1058 "elJefe committed the Crime of Persecution, a Class A Crime,
          in incorrectly alleging in the Public Forum that Morendil was
          Lawless on October 14."
         ChrisM defaults
         Reassigned to General Chaos
CFJ 1059 "Rule 1714 should be interpreted such that an allegation of
          Lawlessness sent to the PF must contain an explicit
          declaration that a particular Player is Lawless."
         Judged TRUE by elJefe, who adds eir belief that "Player X
         has more than 30 Blots" is not such an explicit declaration,
         because verification of its synonymity with "Player X is
         Lawless" requires looking up definitions in the Ruleset.
CFJ 1060 Judgement of FALSE published


OTHER NEWS

Steve points out that Rule 1555 refers to the event (not the condition)
of being deregistered, and thus that it does not cause Morendil to lose
the Office of Speaker-Elect.

Oerjan claims to have been the one who caused Vanyel's deregistration
for inactivity to be delayed.

* October 21:

Murphy posts to the Public Forum and is thereafter Not Absent, whatever
e was previously.

* October 24:

Kolja A. is Elected Ambassador by Acclamation.  Since this preceded
Proposal 3564's adoption, it appears that e later committed the
Infraction of Failure to Report.

Morendil disputes this interpretation with a CFJ, claiming that Rule
1585 and its ASAP timing requirement takes precedence over Rule 1686's
once-every-Nomic-Week timing requirement.  (This reviewer believes that
the CFJ is trivially FALSE due to inaccurate wording.)

* October 26:

Rule 1458 (The Notary) is Disinfected.  The Office of Notary is held
temporarily by Speaker Steve.  Morendil, Elde, and Swann are assigned
Executors in Probate Harlequin, Kolja A., and Steve, respectively;
Blob has not yet been assigned an Executor in Probate.

* October 28:

Vir Rebels.

Uri Bruck becomes a Watcher.

* October 29:

Zefram attempts to make the following Currency transfers:
  0.9 VT to each of Rule 113, the Vototron, the Kudo that favor once
    identified to be buzzing, Plato, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Benjohn
    Barnes, the fyshbowl, Larry Wall, and Screaming Lord Sutch
  1.3 VT to itself
  all eir remaining Currency except 2 VTs to Peter Suber
  one VT to eir other VT
  eir final VT to the VT it possesses
as well as transferring a Kudo from Steve to Vanyel, transferring a
Kudo from General Chaos to Andre, and deregistering; and later CFJing
on the success of some of the Currency transfers (as well as taking
part in an extended argument on the validity of various potential
Currency recipients.

Ackanomic submits the following Internomic proposal:
  Ammend R215 by replacing the string "Rishonomic" with the string
  "New Rishonnomic"
Internomic's policy on misspellings, and thus the potential effect of
this proposal, is not yet determined.

Swann (whose Executor is presumably Steve) claims to re-register,
Rebel, and CFJ on "I (the caller of this CFJ) am my own Executor."

Registrar pro-tem Steve admits Herald Crito's COE on ex-Registrar
Zefram's claim that Crito committed the Infraction of Failure to
Report.  Rule 1733 may grant Steve the power to vacate the relevant
Payment Order; General Chaos points out that a successful CFJ would,
in any case, allow a Judge to vacate it.

KoJen states "I hereby perform every action which is possible for me
to perform in Agora, simultaneously."

* October 30:

Registrar pro-tem Steve initiates Elections for Registrar and Notary.
