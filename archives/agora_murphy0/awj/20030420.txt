ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

"Passing Milkthistle By" by Sherlock - Contested Proposal 4476 failed quorum
   4/14

"Teams clean up" by Peekee - Proposal 4475 rejected 4/14
   Repeal Rule 112 (Ways to Win and Preclusions Thereof), since wins are
     now awarded to Teams rather than individual Players.

"Votes of No Confidence" by Sherlock - Proposal 4477 rejected 4/14
   Presence is repealed.
   A Vote of NO CONFIDENCE does not count toward Quorum.

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Clarify Contest Entry Fees" by OscarMeyr - Proposal 4478 failed quorum 4/14 -
     Complacent Oligarchy - Proposal 4484
   Rule 1539 (Regulations and Membership of Contests) no longer requires
     payment of the Entry Fee if the Contest does not have one.

"Default Budgets and Election Errors" by Steve - Proposal 4474 failed quorum
     4/7 - Complacent Oligarchy - Proposal 4480
   Nominations without a Proto-Budget are automatically associated with one
     identical to the current Budget.  (If that is invalid, then the
     nomination is automatically withdrawn.)
   Election results are valid unless challenged within seven days.

"Fix Dereliction of Duty" by root - Proposal 4481
   Officers cited for Dereliction of Duty are removed, not retired.
   Blob is mauve.

"Fix PWIN" by Peekee - Proposal 4473 failed quorum 4/7 - Complacent Oligarchy
     - Proposal 4479
   PWIN is set to 100.  This repairs part of Rule 1990 (Points Contests)
     that was accidentally broken when Teams were introduced.
   PPP is repealed.  (This would break a different part of Rule 1990.)

"Fix PWIN V2" by Peekee - Proposal 4485
   PWIN is set to 100.  This repairs part of Rule 1990 (Points Contests)
     that was accidentally broken when Teams were introduced.

"More Useful Stem Weather" by OscarMeyr - Proposal 4482
   The destruction phase of Weather remains limited to the Bank's holdings,
     but the creation phase is no longer proportionally limited.

"Of what worth honor?" by Michael, Goethe, et al.
   Rubberstamping, absolution, and debate (changing the chamber of a
     proposal) are generalized into energetic actions, and made 1
     support/Currency more expensive.
   Each Player has a number of Kudos.  Fees are in kudos.
   Once a week, a Player may transfer a kudo from one Player to another
     (e cannot be the recipient), with reasons, provided e emself has
     at least one kudo.
   Patent Titles may be Ephemeral.
   Boons and Albatrosses are Ephemeral Patent Titles.
   Daffodills are generic Boons.
   Carcasses are generic Albatrosses.
   The Herald's Budget includes the Tabla Rasa, an integer between 5 and 25.
   Each quarter, each Player's kudos are set equal to the Tabla Rasa, plus
     the number of eir boons, minus the number of eir albatrosses; Agora's
     kudos are set equal to the Tabla Rasa times the number of players; and
     all Ephemeral Patent Titles are revoked.
   The Tabla Rasa is initially 5.
   Stems, Indulgences, VEs, Papyri, and Land are redeemed in Daffodils.
   Fees are in kudos.  Agora's kudos are increased by the fee.  If an action
     is attempted with insufficient kudos, and a Player's announcement of it
     is confirmed, then the recordkeepor must either (with support) announce
     that it did not occur, or (without 3 objections) announce that it did
     occur.  In the latter case, the Player pays what kudos e can, and receives
     albatrosses for the difference.
   New Players receive twice the Tabla Rasa.
   Mentors receive the Boon of Mentorship; the Protege receives the Boon of
     Politeness.
   Salaries, the Speaker's Gratuity, and the Distributor's Gratuity are 
replaced
     with Daffodils.
   Judicial Salaries are replaced with the Boon of Wisdom, and their revocation
     with the Albatross of Foolishness.
   Birthday gifts are replaced with the Boon of Celebration, and birthday
     contest awards with the Patent Title of Nth Anniversary Ribbon.
   Changing role early costs 2 or 6 kudos.
   Monks are repealed.
   Successful Rebels receive the Ephemeral Patent Title of Rebel Hero.
   The Indulgence tax for successful Rebellion is repealed.
   The GWotO's Budget contains the Oligarchy Charge Requirement (a positive
     integer less than 10, initially 6) and the Oligarchic Term (a number of
     days between 30 and 90, initially 60).
   Any Player may join the Oligarchy by paying the Charge Requirement (halved
     for Politicians), and buy additional terms for the same price.  E is
     removed after the end of eir term(s).
   Appointed Oligarchs get half a term.
   The Treasuror is merged into the Notary.
   Papyri are repealed.
   On Democratic Proposals, non-Oligarchs have a Voting Power of two plus eir
     Voting Potential; Oligarchs, one plus eir Voting Potential.
   Voting Potentials are zeroed monthly.  A Player may buy a Voting 
Potential of
     N (positive integer) by paying the Oligarchy Charge Requirement times N.
   Simplifying the Rules via repeal gains the Ephemeral Patent Title of
     Tapecutter.
   Proposal adoption during Grace Period gains the Ephemeral Patent Title of
     Prodigy.
   Embezzlement is repealed.
   Looting Auctions are repealed.
   Levying Taxes is repealed.
   Speaker's Patronage is replaced with the Ephemeral Patent Title of Gold 
Star.
   Non-standard Auction procedures are repealed.
   Indulgences are repealed.
   Expunging Blots costs 1 kudo per Blot.
   Being Pardoned for Lawlessness restricts energetic actions.
   Team Wins are rewarded with the Ephemeral Patent Title of Team Ribbon.
   Land is repealed.

"Streamline complacency" by root
   If there are too few Oligarchs to meet quorum, then the Assessor may publish
     a Notice of Complacency before the end of the Voting Period.

"Team Shuffling" by Peekee - Proposal 4483
   Upon a Team Win, the highest-Scoring Player in the highest-Scoring Team
     is assigned to the lowest-Scoring Team, and the lowest-Scoring Player
     in the lowest-Scoring Team is assigned to even out Team sizes.  Ties
     are broken by the Scorekeepor's choice.

"Teams clean up" by Peekee - copy of Proposal 4475
   Repeal Rule 112 (Ways to Win and Preclusions Thereof), since wins are
     now awarded to Teams rather than individual Players.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Discretionary Billing" by Murphy
   Optional billing is supported, so that it will generate appropriate debts.
   Paying out and billing are explicitly done by announcement.
   Obligation to announce may be cancelled by forgiving debt, as well as
     satisfying it.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

*** Rule 1567 causes ineligibility by request to expire after one month ***

CFJ 1438 "The Order issued by Steve,
[TRUE]    'I order the Bank to forgive RedKnight's Oligarchy upkeep debt.'
           (http://www.escribe.com/games/agora-business/m9000.html)

           is not a properly-issued Order."
          2/18      Called by Goethe
          2/18-3/2  Assigned to Sir Toby, who defaults
          3/9       Incorrectly assigned to Blob, who is Unready and thus
                      ineligible
          3/9-23    Assigned to Cecilius, who is recused
          3/31      Assigned to Pakaran
          4/14      Assigned to Murphy, who Judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  A Rule bug prevents the GWotO from
            obeying the first requirement of Rule 2010.  Issuing this Order is
            the second requirement of Rule 2010.  The Order is valid, but 
may be
            improper under the circumstances.

CFJ 1446 "The Proposal 'Try Again, Part 1 of 3' is distributable."
          Linked to CFJ 1447
          3/2  Called by Murphy
          3/9-23    Assigned to Cecilius, who is recused
          3/31      Assigned to Blob
          Caller's argument (summary):  Murphy claimed to rubberstamp, without
            specifying a method.  Later, e claimed that e had done it by paying
            a Fee of 0 Papyri.  During the week in which e claimed to
            rubberstamp, e had not previously rubberstamped anything.

CFJ 1447 "The Proposal 'Try Again, Part 2 of 3' is distributable."
          Linked to CFJ 1446
          3/2  Called by Murphy
          3/9-23    Assigned to Cecilius, who is recused
          3/31      Assigned to Blob
          Caller's argument (summary):  Murphy claimed to rubberstamp by paying
            a Fee of 0 Papyri.  During the week in which e made this claim, e
            had not previously rubberstamped anything.

CFJ 1449 "The Proposal entitled 'Full Discretion Fix' would have been
[TRUE]    Rubberstamped by the message sent by Cecilius today under the
Appealed  subject line 'Rubberstamping, Take Two,' if that Proposal had not
           already been Rubberstamped."
          Linked to CFJ 1448
          3/3     Called by Cecilius
          3/9-17  Assigned to Goethe, who Judges TRUE
          3/20    Appealed by Steve, Sir Toby, and Pakaran
          3/20    Appeal assigned to Steve, Eris, and Pakaran
          3/24    Steve moves to overturn and reverse
          3/31    Eris moves to overturn and remand
          Judge Steve's refutation (summary):  Transfers (even of 0)
            require a valid Notice of Transfer, and a Notice of Transfer
            for 0 cannot be valid.
          Commentary:  A Rubberstamped Proposal may be Rubberstamped again.

CFJ ???? "The public message sent by Goethe on April 1st created a requirement
           for at least one Officer to act as soon as possible [after the
           message]."
          4/4  Called by Goethe
          Commentary:  The message in question was written in Turkish.
