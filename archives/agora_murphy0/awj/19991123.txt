CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1172 "The Private Orders issued by Murphy in the message with
[TRUE]    subject 'BUS: Agoran Weekly Journal' dated Sun, 31 Oct 1999
          were improperly executed."
         11/1     Called by Crito
         11/4-12  Assigned to Chuck, who Judges TRUE
         11/18    Chuck vacates Murphy's Private Orders
         Caller's argument (summary):  "improperly" is undefined by the
           Rules, but there was no good reason for these Orders.

CFJ 1173 "Any TO which is successfully received by the Recordkeepor for
[TRUE]    the Currency being transfered is properly executed, even if
          it was redistributed by means of the agora-discussion mailing
          list."
         11/5    Called by Wes
         11/5-8  Assigned to Crito, who Judges TRUE

CFJ 1174 "The PO's issued by Payroll Clerk Lee in the email sent to
[TRUE]    agora-official time/date stamped Fri, 05 Nov 1999 16:36:15
          -0600 were improperly executed, due to the fact that e had
          already executed PO's for the same purpose in the email sent
          to agora-discussion time/date stamped Fri, 05 Nov 1999
          12:15:27 -0500."
         11/5    Called by Wes
         11/5-9  Assigned to Elysion, who Judges TRUE

CFJ 1175 "Peekee changed his ABC to P-Notes, in a message with,
[FALSE]   Message-Id: <199911051747.RAA18759@renko.ucs.ed.ac.uk> sent
          on Fri, 5 Nov 1999 17:47:29 +0000."
         11/6     Called by Peekee
         11/7-10  Assigned to harvel, who Judges FALSE
         Caller's argument (summary):  Peekee set eir ABC on August 29,
           and attempted to change it on November 5.  Rule 1911 (Basic
           Currencies) requires a three-month wait.  Rule 459 (The
           Nomic Week) says that monthly events occur on the first of
           the month, so "three months" have in fact elapsed.
         Judge's refutation (summary):  Change of ABC is not an
           automatic event.  Besides, the Caller's interpretation would
           cause September 1 to be "one month after" August 29, which
           is absurd.

CFJ 1176 "A message sent to agora-discussion and received by the
[FALSE]   intended recipient(s) has full legal effect, unless the Rules
          exclude agora-discussion as a legally effective method of
          delivery for that message."
         11/6     Called by Murphy
         11/7-13  Assigned to Kolja A., who Judges FALSE
         11/14    Appealed by Murphy and Chuck
         Judge's refutation (summary):  "Exclude" is interpreted as
           "exclude explicitly" and thus fails to include requirements
           to post to the Public Forum.

CFJ 1177 "The Proposal "Voters and Legislators 1.1", as Proposed by
[FALSE]   Peekee on the 6th of November 1999, was made Disinterested by
          Peekee on the 9th of November 1999."
         11/11     Called by Peekee
         11/13-14  Assigned to lee, who Judges FALSE
         Caller's argument (summary):  Intent was announced before the
           Proposal was submitted, but this is okay.  Peekee's
           submission on November 6 and attempted Disinteresting on
           November 9 are not questioned.
         Judge's refutation (summary):  Intent did not unambiguously
           identify a Proposal.

CFJ 1178 "Rule 1729 permits voting on Insane Proposals by private
[TRUE]    message to the Assessor, even when the prevailing mode of
          voting on Proposals is Public."
         11/12     Called by Blob
         11/13-18  Assigned to Michael, who Judges TRUE
         11/19     Michael grants Motion to Annotate Rule 1729
         Caller's argument (summary):  It takes precedence over Rule
           1764 (Modes of Voting).

CFJ 1179 "If the Rules require a Player to act on a message in a
[TRUE]    certain way upon receiving it - without restrictions on the
          method of delivery - and the Player receives the message via
          agora-discussion, then e is still required to act on it in
          that way."
         11/14     Called by Murphy
         11/14-15  Assigned to Palnatoke, who Judges TRUE
         Judge's argument (summary):  Receiving a message via a-d is
           still receiving it.

CFJ 1180 "Peekee successfully raised the Priority of eir Proposal 'Secret
          Proposals' repeatedly in the message titled 'Priority Increase'
          with 'Message-Id: <199911181025.KAA09187@renko.ucs.ed.ac.uk>'
          as sent to the PF on the 18th of November 1999."
         11/19  Called by Peekee
         11/20  Assigned to Murphy
         Caller's argument (summary):  Increasing a Proposal's Priority
           by the same amount multiple times is still a single purpose.


OFFICES
-------

11/12  Voting begins in Registrar Election.  Candidates are Michael and
         Peekee.

11/21  Michael is Elected Registrar.


OTHER
-----

11/7   Wes resigns as Contestmaster of The Magical Sheltor, causing it
         to dissolve.

11/8   Wes makes Chuck Quiet.

11/12  Chuck posts to the Public Forum, becoming Noisy again.

11/16  Peekee attempts to make "Voters and Legislators 1.1"
         Disinterested, having "announced" eir intent to emself; but
         Rule 478 defines "announce" as "send to the Public Forum".

       Peekee becomes a Maniac.

11/18  Treasuror Blob seeks Support to amend the Budget as follows, to
         reflect "Bookkeeping Reduction":
           Include the current Basic Officer Salary
           Remove the recently repealed Chancellor
           Transfer 0.2 BOS from Registrar to Payroll Clerk

       harvel and lee Support this change.

       Peekee attempts to increase a Proposal's Priority by 2 several
         times, arguing that the additional increases are not "other
         purposes" for the Transfer Order enabling a single increase.

       lee announces intent to levy a 50% Stem Tax on 12/2, exempting
         250 Stems per Player and 10 Stems per non-Player.

11/19  Crito Supports the Budget amendment.

11/20  Treasuror Blob acknowledges that eir Budget amendment would not
         reflect "Minimum Income".  E seeks Support for a new Budget
         amendment, as follows:
           Include the current Basic Officer Salary
           Remove the recently repealed Chancellor
           Transfer 0.2 BOS from Registrar to Payroll Clerk
           Adjust all Salaries to use Minimum Income method

       lee Supports this change.
