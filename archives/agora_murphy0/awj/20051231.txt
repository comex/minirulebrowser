ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Boon Cash-Out" by Goethe - Proposal 4844 adopted 12/4
  Award heavy pending draws based on Boon holdings at the time Kudos
    were repealed.

"Generalize Compensation for Ex-Cards" by Murphy - Proposal 4843 adopted
    11/9
  When a class of cards is repealed, non-site instances are converted to
    pending draws.

"Order categorical" by Goethe - Proposal 4841 adopted 10/27
  Merge Rule 1048 (Rule Categories) into Rule 1681 (The Logical
    Rulesets).
  New rules are assigned to categories at Rulekeepor discretion.  All
    other category operations are without 2 objections.

"Pragmatize hand limits" by Goethe - Proposal 4846 adopted 12/31
  Maximum hand size does not prevent drawing cards, but reduces a
    player's hand monthly as needed.

"some fixup" by Goethe - Proposal 4840 adopted 10/27
  Replace the Grace Period kudo clause with three free draws.
  Add a missing word to Rule 2019 (The Speaker's Veto) ("Assessor shall
    [place] a copy").

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

"Clarify Rule 1567" by Murphy - Proposal 4842 rejected 11/9
  Requests like e.g. "all CFJs for the next two weeks" are interpreted
    as "all CFJs called within the next two weeks".

"Recording Orthodoxy" by OscarMeyr - Proposal 4845 failed quorum 12/31
  Assigned to the Registrar.

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"The Last Vestige of Initiative" by OscarMeyr
  Finish repealing Initiative.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Chips" by Murphy
  Replace heavy pending draws with white chips, and free pending draws
    with red chips.  Award a (useless but pretty) blue chip on a Win.

"Fees, please" by root
  Fees are paid by discarding cards and/or forfeiting pending draws.

"Fix Rule 1558" by Maud
  Elections for Offices may be resolved before the end of the voting
    period if there are less than three candidates.

"Pragmatic infinity" by Goethe
  The Library gains pending draws in proportion to cars checked out (or
    a lack of both cards in hand and cards checked out), rather than
    gaining them whenever eir hand size is below maximum (which may
    occur infinitely many times if the hand size formula is broken).
  Reinitialize the Library's pending draws.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1278  "The Assessor has announced the results of the voting on
[TRUE]     Proposal 4111."
          2/21/01           Called by Murphy
          2/26/01-3/8/01    Assigned to Syllepsis, who Judges TRUE
          8/10/05           Goethe motions the now-deregistered
                              Syllepsis to consider a spurious argument
                              ("Basset Hounds have Long Ears"); see CFJ
                              1575
          8/26/05-10/16/05  Motion assigned to root; e denies the
                              motion, and fulfills eir (buggy)
                              requirement to judge by judging TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  The Assessor's announcement
            specified the Vote count correctly, but specified the result
            of that Vote count (adoption or rejection) incorrectly.
          Judge's argument (summary):  Later in the message, the
            Assessor specified the result of the Vote count correctly.

CFJ 1576  "Goethe successfully played Corporate Bankruptcy on or about
[TRUE]     Oct. 31, 2005."
          10/31    Called by Goethe
          11/9-16  Assigned to Maud, who judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  This requires noting a fee
            (which e did), but fees are not explicitly defined.

CFJ 1577  "The Registrar has not legally resolved the Rebellion that
            occurred on December 15th, 2005."
          12/17  Called by Sherlock
          12/31  Assigned to Quazie
          Caller's argument (summary):  The Registrar chose a random
            number from 1 to 12, but was required to choose between 11
            equally likely choices.

CFJ 1578  "Eris's play of Thieves in the Night naming Riail was
           successful."
          Linked to CFJ 1579
          12/21  Called by Eris
          12/22  Eris attempts to submit this CFJ to the Justiciar
          Comments:  Riail was deregistered at the time.  This may be
            interpreted as Eris falsely asserting that Riail was a
            player, causing em to gain an albatross.

CFJ 1579  "Eris gained an albatross of the Thief from eir play of
            Thieves in the Night naming Riail."
          Linked to CFJ 1578
          12/21  Called by Eris
          12/22  Eris attempts to submit this CFJ to the Justiciar
