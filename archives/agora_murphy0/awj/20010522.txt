ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Ambiguous Ordering Fix" by Elysion - Proposal 4150 adopted 5/10
  An attempt to make multiple simultaneous communications, not explicitly
    ordered, fails if any two specific orderings would result in substantively
    different gamestates.

"Criminal Simplification" by Murphy - Proposal 4152 adopted 5/8
  General restrictions on the identity, reporting, and penalizing of Crimes and
    Infractions is streamlined into a single Rule.
  A Notice of Infraction shall explicitly specify the Infraction, committer,
    Rule(s) defining it, action/inaction, and Orders to impose the penalty;
    these Orders shall be vacated if a COE on the commission is admitted.

"Finally, pragmatic Currencies" by Steve (Proposed by Ian, presumably so as to
recover Distribution Cost upon adoption) - Proposal 4156 adopted 5/15
  Property transfers unauthorized by the Rules are no longer generally
    ineffective, but the Property must be returned; failure to do so is the
    Class 10 Crime of Receiving Stolen Property.
  Making an intentional unauthorized Property transfer from the Bank is the
    Class 10 Crime of Embezzlement.

"Group Votes revised" by Michael - Proposal 4153 adopted 5/8
  For Democratic Proposals, Groups with three or more members have Voting Power
    equal to the number of Players divided by the number of such Groups.

"Help New Players" by harvel - Proposal 4155 adopted 5/15
  New Players become Unready at the beginning of eir Grace Period, and Ready at
    the end of it.
  An Unready Player may become Ready by saying so.
  Rule 698 (Always an Eligible Judge) explicitly asserts its power to command
    Inactive Players, and extends eligibility to the Caller as a last resort.
  An Unready Player does not appear in the Order of Succession to the
    Speakership.
  Ordering an Unready Player to Formally Apologize for violating a Rule is
    optional.
  An Unready Player may expunge half of any Blots e receives.
  The New Player Award is part of the Treasuror's Budget.
  All Players currently in their Grace Period become Unready.
  All Players who registered on or after September 21, 2000, and are currently
    in eir Grace Period, receive the New Player Award.

"Inflationary Patronage" by Kelly - Proposal 4151 adopted 5/10
  The Speaker's Patronage is half the Basic Officer Salary.

"Keep it Quiet" by harvel - Proposal 4154 adopted 5/15
  A Player is never more than one of Noisy/Quiet/Silent.

"The Whole Truth" by Kelly - Proposal 4148 adopted 5/10
  A Player may be convicted of Perjury or Misrepresentation only if e willfully
    made a false statement of fact.  Specifically:
      * E must intend to make a false statement of fact.
      * E must realize that the statement e makes is false.
      * Excusable negligence, reasonable error, and reasonable reliance on the
          representations of another are defenses.
      * A conclusion as to the interpretation or application of the Rules is
          not a "statement of fact".
  Falsification is merged into Misrepresentation.

"What is Public?" by Wes - Proposal 4147 adopted 5/10
  Discussion Fora are defined.  Messages sent to one are deemed not to have
    been sent to all Players.
  An announcement that a medium becomes / ceases to be a Public Forum or
    Discussion Forum must be made via all existing Public Fora.
  All other Rules mentioning a/the Public Forum are rewritten using "publicly".
  [Due to insufficient Power, this Proposal failed to amend Rules 1016, 1728,
    1937, and 376.  Due to incorrect text matching, it failed to amend Rules
    1570 and 1714.]

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Applications Revisited" by Kelly - Proposal 4159
  Non-Players may submit Applications.
  Players do not sign Applications directly, but consent to eir signature being
    attached by the submitter.

"Calling Bonds" by Kelly
  The issuer of a Bond may call that Bond (causing it to accelerate
    immediately) by announcing that e does so.

"Deferred Blots" by Kelly
  Blots that would be gained by a non-Player entity are gained by its Executor
    instead.  If the entity has no Executor, then the entity gains deferred
    Blots instead; when it gains an Executor, the Executor gains Blots.

"Fix 'Complacent Oligarchy'" by Steve - Proposal 4161
  When an Ordinary Proposal fails quorum, the Assessor shall publish a Notice
    of Complacency, which puts a Democratic Distributable copy back into the
    Pool (so it gets reported as part of a normal Proposal Distribution).
  Publishing a Notice of Complacency for an Ordinary Proposal that achieved
    Quorum is the Class 2 Crime of Sending It Back Where It Don't Belong.

"Fix Help New Players" by root
  Rather than Ordering the Treasuror to pay out the New Player Award, the
    Registrar pays it out emself.

"Fix Rule 1712" by Elysion
  The number of Indulgences to auction each month is rounded down to an
    integer, if needed.

"Generalized Applications" by Kelly
  Non-Players may execute or sign Applications.

"Make Rule 1827 Consistent" by root - Proposal 4160
  Judicial Motions must be granted or denied within five days.  The Rule
    currently uses five days when imposing the requirement, but seven days
    when specifying the Infraction for failiure.

"Oligarchic Orthodoxy" by Elysion - Proposal 4157
  Rebels shall be removed from the Oligarchy.

"Poor Man's Agora" by Syllepsis - Proposal 4158
  A Sanctimonious Player is all of the following:
    * an Immaculate Senator
    * neither a Zombie nor a Zombie Master
    * possesses no VEs, and at most 4 x BOS in Stems
    * controls no other entity (other than the Bank or Monastery) possessing
        Zombies, VEs, or Stems
  A Player Sanctimonious for at least a week may become a Monk.
  A Monk reported as non-Sanctimonious for at least 48 hours ceases to be a
    Monk at the beginning of the next week.
  At the beginning of the month, or while there is no Abbot, the Stem-poorest
    Monk (ties broken randomly) becomes Abbot, Executor of the Monastery.
  The Monastery may give away its VEs, as long as it keeps at least five.
  For Democratic Proposals, the Voting Power of the Monastery is one plus the
    number of VEs it holds.
  Any Monk may make a Proposal Democratic, With 3 Monk Supporters.
  Any Player or set of Players may make a Proposal Democratic by giving 0.3 VEs
    to the Monastery.

"Proper Persistent Indebtedness" by Kelly
  The creditor of a debt may simply demand its satisfaction, rather than
    Ordering such.
  Persistent Indebtedness is committed:
    * By an entity's Executor, or (if none) its Limited Executor;
    * Only if the Executor (Limited Executor) is authorized to execute a
        transfer for that entity which would satisfy the debt;
    * Only if the entity has Property sufficient to satisfy the debt.

"Simplify New Player Award" by Murphy
  Rather than being Ordered by the Registrar to pay out the New Player Award,
    the Treasuror is directly required to pay it out.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Clarify Orders" by Goethe
  Orders must state their class.

"Finish Helping New Players" by harvel
  Players who registered on or after September 21, 2000, and had a Grace Period
    from it that ended before "Help New Players" was adopted, receive the
    current New Player Award minus the New Player Award at the time of eir
    registration.
  Players who registered on or after September 21, 2000, and were in eir Grace
    Period when "Help New Players" was adopted, owe the Bank (for each Bank
    Currency) the current New Player Award or the New Player Award at the time
    of eir registration, whichever is less.

"Not So Soon" by harvel
  If an Officer must ASAP perform an action dependent on information tracked by
    another Officer and not published within the past week, then e has one week
    after it is next published to perform the action.

"The Value of PI" by root
  <This Proto-Proposal is in error.  PI is 5.3714.  Adjust your instruments
   accordingly.  Please consult the E-Scribe agora-discussion archive for
   May 16, 2001.>

"Vickrey Auctions" by Elysion
  In a Vickrey Auction:
    * The Auction lasts one week.
    * Bidders may bid privately.
    * Players with the same Executor as the Auctioneer must bid in public, and
        during the first three days.
    * The Auction Price is the highest non-winning bid.
  Papyrus Auctions are Vickrey Auctions.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1273  <5/21  Goethe Orders the Rulekeepor to annotate Rule 1564, then stays
            eir Order because the requested annotation was not the Statement of
            Rule 1273>

CFJ 1274  <5/7  Appealed by Kelly>

CFJ 1279  "Proposal 4112 is Democratic."
[TRUE]    2/21      Called by Murphy
          2/26-3/2  Assigned to pTang, who Judges FALSE
          3/3-5     Appealed by Murphy, Taral, and Elysion
          3/30      Appeal assigned to lee, Steve, and Wes
          4/5       Steve and lee move to overturn and reassign
          4/7       Wes is automatically recused
          4/8       Wes attempts to move to overturn and reassign; eir
                      automatic recusal had been overlooked
          4/8       Mistakenly reassigned to Hooloovoo
          4/13      Hooloovoo (attempts to) proto-Judge FALSE
          4/13      Wes replaced by Razl on Board of Appeals
          4/15      Hooloovoo attempts to Judge FALSE
          4/20      Razl is automatically recused
          5/4       Razl replaced by Crito on Board of Appeals
          5/4       Crito moves to overturn and reassign
          5/5-10    Reassigned to Ziggy, who Judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  If CFJ 1278 is false, then so is this;
            otherwise, while Proposal 4111 is adopted too early to place a
            requirement on the Assessor to announce Proposal 4112's failing
            quorum, it may still cause Proposal 4112 to become Democratic upon
            the Assessor's announcement.
          Judge pTang's refutation (summary):  Assessor t's announcement that
            Proposal 4112 failed quorum was not required by Rule 1965, so it
            was not "such an announcement" to cause Proposal 4112 to become
            Democratic.
          Board of Appeals grounds for overturning (summary):  There are three
            possible readings of "such an announcement" (of failed Quorum) in
            Rule 1965:  any announcement, an announcement required by the
            Rules, and an announcement required by Rule 1965 itself.  pTang
            failed to consider the second possibility.  Also, due to the
            partly-switched information in the relevant announcement by
            Assessor t, it may be that Proposal 4112 failing Quorum was
            announced before Rule 1965 was created.
          Judge Ziggy's argument (summary):  The voting results of Proposals
            4111 and 4112 were announced in the same message, and so (by Rule
            376) Proposal 4111 takes effect first because it was distributed
            first.  Ziggy interprets "such an announcement" as any announcement
            that an Ordinary Proposal has failed Quorum, and so Assessor t's
            announcement made Proposal 4112 Democratic.

CFJ 1290  "Goethe is a Contestant in the Agora the Beautiful Contest."
[TRUE]    4/27    Called by Goethe
          5/2-10  Assigned to solublefish, who Judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Goethe has made several statements
            which the Contest equates with consent to join, but e has neither
            explicitly consented nor explicitly denied consent to join.
          Judge's argument (summary):  Goethe clearly knew that eir statements
            were equated by the Contest with consent to join, so e implicitly
            consented to join.

CFJ 1291  "The Clerk of the Courts, Wes, has broken Rule 991, 'Invoking
[FALSE]    Judgement."
          5/3     Called by Goethe
          5/3-10  Assigned to lee, who Judges FALSE
          5/10    Appealed by harvel, who meant to Appeal CFJ 1292 instead
          Caller's argument (summary):  Wes announced the identity of the Judge
            of CFJ 1290 while omitting most of the Caller's evidence.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  The announcement in question got the
            identity of the Judge wrong, and the first correct announcement
            included the Caller's evidence.

CFJ 1292  "Kelly cast a nonzero number of Votes on Proposal 4139."
[FALSE]   5/4     Called by Kelly
          5/4-10  Assigned to Oerjan, who Judges FALSE
          5/11    Appealed by harvel
          Caller's argument (summary):  Kelly attempted to cast 0.5 Votes
            AGAINST Proposal 4139.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Rules 683 and 1715 indicate that Votes
            must be cast in integral quantities.

CFJ 1293  "Kelly's Order to Razl <15095.12486.922540.638717@ozma.pyrzqxgl.org>
[TRUE]     was improperly or invalidly executed."
          5/8      Called by Razl
          5/10-14  Assigned to Peekee, who Judges TRUE
          5/14     Peekee vacates Kelly's Order
          5/14     Clerk of the Courts Wes stays Kelly's Order
          Caller's argument (summary):  Kelly's Order is not permitted,
            required, or otherwise specifically described by the Rules.

CFJ 1294  "The Administrative Orders issued by the Executor of the Bank in
Dismissed  <20010508144200.E5865@cse.unsw.edu.au>
           http://www.escribe.com/games/agora-business/m3682.html are
           improperly or invalidly executed."
          5/8      Called by Razl
          5/10-17  Assigned to Taral
          5/10     Incorrectly assigned to Syllepsis, based on the belief that
                     Taral's assignment was incorrect
          5/14     Clerk of the Courts Wes stays Blob's Orders
          Caller's argument (summary):  Orders to satisfy debts are regulated
            by Rule 1599 and may target only the debtor, not its Executor or
            Limited Executor.
          Judge's argument for dismissal (summary):  The Orders in question do
            not pertain to the duties of an Office, hence they are Private
            rather than Administrative, hence the Statement is broken because
            it attempts to refer to nonexistent Administrative Orders.

CFJ 1295  "The Orders issued by Blob in <20010508144200.E5865@cse.unsw.edu.au>
[FALSE]    http://www.escribe.com/games/agora-business/m3682.html are
           improperly or invalidly executed."
          5/9      Called by Razl
          5/10-17  Assigned to Evantine, who Judges TRUE
          5/13     Evantine submits and grants a Motion to emself, and Orders
                     Clerk of the Courts Wes to stay Blob's Orders ASAP
          5/14     Clerk of the Courts Wes stays Blob's Orders
          5/17-18  Appealed by Taral, Kelly, and lee
          5/19     Appeal assigned to Steve, Kelly, and Wes
          5/19     Wes moves to sustain
          5/21     Steve proto-moves to overturn and reassign
          Caller's argument (summary):  Orders to satisfy debts are regulated
            by Rule 1599 and may target only the debtor, not its Executor or
            Limited Executor.
          Judge Evantine's argument (summary):  The Orders are Administrative
            Orders (Blob prefaced them with "As Executor of the Bank"), hence
            they are regulated, hence they are not blanket-permitted by Rule
            101; and they are not explicitly permitted by the Rules, hence they
            are invalid.
          Justice Steve's argument (summary):  Although Blob is Executor of the
            Bank because e is Treasuror, e was not necessarily carrying out a
            Treasuror duty.  In particular, it doesn't matter what type of
            Order Blob intended to make, only what type of Order e actually
            made.  Treasuror duties are limited to what the Rules explicitly
            impose, so the Orders are Private and valid (but may or may not be
            proper).

CFJ 1296  "In eir judgement of CFJ 1293, Peekee violated Rule 217."
Dismissed 5/15  Called by Blob
          5/19  Assigned to Wes
          Caller's argument (summary):  Peekee failed to consider the past
            Judgements in CFJs 1172, 1182, 1191, and 1247.
          Commentary:  Rule 1830 requires the dismissal of a CFJ alleging that
            a Judge has failed to perform a Judicial duty.  Such a belief
            should instead lead to Appealing the Judge's failure to perform
            that duty.
