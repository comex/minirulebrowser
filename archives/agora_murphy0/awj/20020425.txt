ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Cold Storage" by harvel - Proposal 4278 adopted 4/3
  A Player may put emself in cold storage, making em a "baridi".  The Treasuror
    becomes eir Limited Executor, with the ability and duty to transfer eir
    Property to the Bank; the Bank then owes those Properties to em.
  A Player must wait 90 days to come out of cold storage and become inactive,
    and an additional week to become active.
  A baridi may not Vote, Propose, hold Office, or be required by the Rules to
    do anything (even by a Rule claiming it can do so).
  A baridi becomes Silent after two years.
  For the purpose of Quorum, a baridi is considered not to exist at all.
  Various other Rules pertaining to Activity are adjusted to account for a
    three-state system.

"Fix Dependent Actions" by harvel - Proposal 4279 adopted 4/3
  The holder of an Office may perform a Dependent Action that a previous holder
    of that Office announced eir intent to perform.
  Objections may be retracted.

"Fix 'Oligarchy Upkeep'" by Steve - Proposal 4268 adopted 3/22
  If an Oligarch is removed for failure to pay eir Upkeep, then the Upkeep debt
    is forgiven.

"Fix Proposal 4259" by root - Proposal 4267 adopted 3/22
  Punctuation correction in Rule 1975.
  Remove the obsolete concept of Elder Oligarchs from Rules 1955 (The Grand
    Warden of the Oligarchy) and 2010 (Oligarchy Upkeep).
  Put the identity of the Speaker and the date of the next quarterly Speaker
    Transition back into the GWotO's Report.

"Fix Raffles" by Steve - Proposal 4265 adopted 3/16
  The Riff-Raff is the Auctioneer, rather than defaulting to the Speaker.  (The
    Auctioneer already defaults to the Speaker.)
  The definition of Final Auction Price for a Raffle is repealed, as it has no
    effect.

"Make Insanity More Interesting" by OscarMeyr - Proposal 4277 adopted 4/3
  A Player's Votes on an Insane Proposal must be all FOR or all AGAINST.

"Massive Economic Reform" by Goethe - Proposal 4281 adopted 4/16
  Anyone may bid on Voting Entitlements, Papyri, and Indulgences.
  A Scribe may Rubberstamp a Proposal (making it Distributable) by paying N
    Papyri, or with the Support of N other Scribes, where N is the number of
    Proposals e has previously Rubberstamped that week.
  An Acolyte may Absolve (expunge) a Blot from any entity by paying N
    Indulgences, or with the Support of N other Acolytes, where N is the number
    of Blots e has previously Absolved that week.
  An Acolyte with the Support of another Acolyte may Exorcise a Dissolute
    Entity (transferring all its Indulgences to the Bank).
  An Acolyte with the Support of a Scribe (or vice versa) may Bless an
    undistributed Proposal (making it Democratic).
  A Politician with the Support of another Politician may Unbless an
    undistributed Blessed Proposal.
  An Untainted Speaker with 2 Supporters may Sanitise a Distributed Proposal in
    its Voting Period (Aborting it, but leaving it Distributable, and making it
    Democratic and Sane).

"Massive Land Reform" by Goethe - Proposal 4283 adopted 4/16
  The Mapkeepor gets an extra month's Salary.
  Each Player that previously owned Land is Entitled.
  All Land becomes Aether.
  Everything with a location becomes located at (0, 0).
  Latitude and Longitude are contracted from [-25, +25] to [-9, +9].
  Land Types are Black and White.
  Connectedness by Type/Subtype is defined.
  Movement Units are spent as follows:
    *  2 - Move from location to non-Aether location of same type.
    *  5 - Move from location to non-Aether location of different type.
    *  5 - Set Type of land you own to anything but Aether.
    * 10 - Set Type of your Land Bureau-owned location to anything but Aether.
  On the 15th of each month:
    * Land Units not connected by their own type to a unit of Aether (i.e.
      surrounded by Land Units of other non-Aether types) become Aether, owned
      by the Land Bureau, and any entities there become located at (0, 0).
    * If there are more Land Units of a non-Aether type than of all other
      non-Aether types combined, then they have Sente.  All other Land Units
      have Gote.
    * Players whose Location has Sente get double Minimum Income.
    * The owner of a Location that has Sente gets 3/2/1 Stems, depending on
      whether the Weather is Plenty/Fair/Foul.
  (0, 0) is initially Black, and owned by the Bank.
  All Entitled Players have seven days to name a Land Unit and Type; it becomes
    that type, the Player becomes located there, and the Land Bureau owes that
    Land Unit to that Player.

"Massive Political Reform" by Goethe - Proposal 4282 adopted 4/16
  A Proposal has exactly one Chamber:  Ordinary, Democratic, or Parliamentary.
  On a Parliamentary Proposal:
    * Players Vote as if it were Ordinary (for Oligarchs) or Democratic (for
      non-Oligarchs), but these Votes do not count directly.
    * If it would have been adopted as Ordinary, then the Oligarchy casts one
      Vote FOR.  If it would have been rejected (but met Quorum) as Ordinary,
      then the Oligarchy casts one Vote AGAINST.
    * If it would have been adopted as Democratic, then the Democracy casts one
      Vote FOR.  If it would have been rejected (but met Quorum) as Democratic,
      then the Democracy casts one Vote AGAINST.
    * The Speaker casts one Vote FOR, unless e is Untainted and Vetoes it, in
      which case e casts one Vote AGAINST.
  Quorum on a Parliamentary Proposal is 2.
  A Politician may change a non-Sane Proposal's Chamber by paying its Chamber
    Fee.  This is initially 0.1 Voting Entitlement, and doubles each time it is
    paid for a given Proposal.  If the Proposal is in its Voting Period, then
    it is Aborted (but remains Distributable, etc.).

"Organizations Can Move, Too!" by OscarMeyr - Proposal 4280 adopted 4/3
  Organizations may spend up to 5 Movement Units per week.
  The Mapkeepor shall monitor the location of all entities with a location, not
    just Players.

"Qualified Speaker's Veto" by Steve - Proposal 4276 adopted 3/27
  The Speaker may, with the support of one-third of the Oligarchy (rounded
    down), Veto an Ordinary Proposal in its Voting Period, causing it to fail
    Quorum automatically (and thus be re-Distributed as a Democratic Proposal).

"Simplify TIA" by Murphy - Proposal 4273 adopted 3/22
  The definition of "willfully make a false statement of fact" is itemized.

"Streamline Blots" by Murphy - Proposal 4272 adopted 3/22
  Move the definition of Blots into its own Rule, with more streamlined
    language - a Player's number of Blots is eir Stain, just as eir number of
    Points is eir Score.  (This would incidentally destroy all Blots, as they
    would be momentarily undefined.)
  Move the clause for expunging Blots with Indulgences into its own Rule.

"Streamline Succession and Delegation" by Murphy - Proposal 4271 adopted 3/22
  Resignation is itemized into two cases:  (1) Electee resigns with successor;
    (2) non-Electee resigns, or Electee resigns without successor.
  Initiating Delegation is consistently itemized.  Other aspects of Delegation
    are consistently described with simple two- or three-clause paragraphs.

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

"And Void" by Goethe - Contested Proposal 4269 rejected 3/22

"April Contested Proposal" by Steve - Contested Proposal 4285 rejected 4/18

"Mutually Exclusive Offices" by Murphy - Proposal 4274 rejected 3/22
  Responsibility for tracking the identity of the Speaker is given solely to
    the Assistant Director of Personnel.
  The Order of Succession is generalized to fill any Office that would not
    otherwise be validly filled.
  A Player is ineligible to hold an Office that is Mutually Exclusive with an
    Office e already holds.  If needed, e is removed from the conflicting
    Office e came to hold most recently.  The Speaker is removed from any
    Office that is Mutually Exclusive with Speaker-Elect.
  Speaker-Elect, Clerk of the Courts, and Justiciar are Mutually Exclusive.
  Speaker-Elect and Assistant Director of Personnel are Mutually Exclusive.
  Promotor and Assessor are Mutually Exclusive.

"The Jailor" by Murphy - Proposal 4270 rejected 3/22
  The Office of Jailor has a Budget that sets the Class of each Crime and
    Infraction.
  The Class of a Crime is from 0 to 15.
  The Class of an Infraction is from 0 to 5.
  Dereliction of Duty may be penalized as if it were a Crime.

"The Scorekeepor's Budget" by root - Proposal 4275 rejected 3/22
  The Scorekeepor's Budget contains:
    * The Goal, an integer from 30 to 300.
    * A Point Award or Penalty for each Scoreworthy Event.
    * Up to five Point Awards or Penalties for non-Scoreworthy Events.
    * The Contestant's Purse Frequency, an integer from 1 to 6.  The
        Contestant's Purse is paid out at intervals of this many months.
    * The Contestant's Purse Multiplier, a multiple of 0.1 from 0.5 to 2.0.
        The Contestant's Purse equals the New Player Award for Indulgences and
        Papyri combined, multiplied by the Contestant's Purse Multiplier.
  All Point Awards and Penalties are integers from 0 to 30, with an average no
    greater than 10.  The Budget must contain at least one Point Award.
  The Contestant's Purse is paid out to the Player who got the most Points from
    Points Contests from the beginning of the previous Contestant's Purse Month
    to the beginning of the current Contestant's Purse Month.  (In case of
    ties, no one gets it.)

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Add a (Roundabout) Way to Auction Land" by Sir Toby
  For 10 Movement Units, an entity may set the Land Type of a random adjacent
    Land Bureau-owned Aether to a non-Aether Type of eir choice.

"Auto complacency" by OscarMeyr
  If the Oligarchy lacks quorum, then all Proposals become Democratic, and the
    existing Oligarchs need not pay Upkeep.

"Judicial Reform, Part 1 of 2" by Murphy
  Rule 991 (Invoking Judgement) picks up the core of Rule 1563 (Statement of a
    CFJ), which is then repealed.

"Judicial Reform, Part 2 of 2" by Murphy
  A CFJ may be filed with the Justiciar for any reason, though this is not
    recommended in the general case.
  Rules 897 (Barring Players from Judgement), 1562 (Excess CFJs), 1868
    (Selecting a Judge), 408 (Late Judgement), 591 (Legal Judgements), 1575
    (Standards of Proof) have their language simplified.
  Rule 698 (Always an Eligible Judge) is reworded to restore eligibility to
    groups of Players at a time, rather than changing the overall eligibility
    formula at each step.
  Rule 1756 (Delinquent Judges) is repealed.
  Linked CFJs are Judged by a single Judge.
  Caller must submit evidence when accusing a Player of shirking a duty.
  DISMISSED is a Judgement.  Other Rules are adjusted accordingly.
  Justices become Appelate Judges, as opposed to Trial Judges.

    a Justice must determine, what determinations e may make, and what e is
    paid for determining on time.
  Board of Appeals may overturn and remand to original Judge for re-Judgement.
  Rule 908 (Formal Apologies) picks up the text of Rule 1832 (Failure to
    Apologize), which is then repealed.

"Opening the Oligarchy" by Goethe
  The GWotO's Budget includes the Base Seating Fee, from 0.1 to 0.5 Voting
    Entitlements (inclusive).
  Non-Politicians may bid for positions in the Oligarchy, but must pay the Base
    Seating Fee in addition to eir winning bid.  Politicians need only pay eir
    winning bid.
  Monthly Upkeep equals the Base Seating Fee for Politicians, double for
    non-Politicians, but waived for anyone who paid a Fee in VEs to become an
    Oligarch within the past 21 days.
  If the Oligarchy cannot meet Quorum, then the GWotO may make any consenting
    Player an Oligarch, Without 3 Objections.  The Player must pay the Seating
    Fee if a Politician, twice if not.

"Positive Degrees" by OscarMeyr
  Degree requirements are changed from the negative voice ("cannot be awarded
    unless X") to the positive voice ("requires X").

"The stack" by Syllepsis
  The stack is a list of the non-negative integers, maintained by the Office of
    Processor.
  Each element of the stack has:
    * A type, initially undefined.  It may be integer, real, string, pointer,
      Player, etc.
    * A value, initially undefined.
    * A read-access (type and value) list, initially all entities.
    * A write-access (value) list, initially all entities.
    * A modify-access (type) list, initially all entities.
    * A list of labels, which are alternate ways to refer to it.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1345 "The ratification of the Payroll Clerk's Report of Tue 29 Jan
[FALSE]   2002 caused at least one debt of a Judicial Salary to change
          from outstanding to not outstanding."
         3/15     Called by Murphy
         3/15     Murphy moves that Payroll Clerk forgive any debts due to
                    payment of Judicial debts on February 25 that became not
                    outstanding due to Ratification
         3/15-23  Assigned to Goethe, who Judges FALSE and denies Motion
         Caller's argument (summary):  The Ratified Report claimed that the
           list of outstanding debts (Stem debts, implicitly) was empty.
         Judge's refutation (summary):  This information was not part of the
           required content of the Report, and thus was not Ratified.

CFJ 1346 "The Bank is deemed to have incurred a debt of 3.0 Voting
[TRUE]    Entitlements to:
Appealed    (a) any and every judge who returns a judgment of TRUE on this CFJ,
                and;
            (b) any and every  member of a Board of Appeals who Overturns a
                judgment of FALSE on this CFJ or sustains a judgment of TRUE on
                this CFJ."
         4/10     Called by Goethe
         4/10-11  Assigned to root, who Judges TRUE
         4/11-12  Appealed by Steve, Goddess Eris, and OscarMeyr
         4/15     Appeal incorrectly assigned to Murphy (Barred), OscarMeyr,
                    and Goddess Eris (see CFJs 1347 and 1348)
         4/16     Alleged Justice Murphy moves to overturn and dismiss
         4/16     Possible Justice OscarMeyr moves to overturn and dismiss
         4/17     Possible Justice Goddess Eris moves to overturn and reverse

CFJ 1347 "Murphy is not a Justice in Appeal 1346a."
         4/17  Called by root
         Caller's argument (summary):  Murphy was Barred from Judging CFJ 1346
           by the Caller.  This made em ineligible to be a Justice, since eir
           ineligibility did not result in less than three eligible Justices.

CFJ 1348 "No Justices have been appointed in Appeal 1346a."
         4/17  Called by root
         Caller's argument (summary):  Murphy's assignment was invalid (see CFJ
           1347), and thus the selection attempt is entirely invalid.

CFJ 1349 "The Judgement of CFJ 21 was incorrect."
         4/17  Called by Syllepsis

CFJ 1350 "Sir Toby's first insane proposal submitted on 18 April 2002 is a null
          proposal."
         4/18  Called by harvel
         Caller's argument (summary):  The Proposal in question has this body:
           YES MEANS NO
           NO MEANS YES
         which does not propose to change Rules or the Gamestate.

CFJ 1351 "Proposal 4285 is Insane."
         4/18  Called by Sir Toby
         Caller's argument (summary):  The body of Proposal 4285 contains no
           miniscule letters.
         Counterargument:  It contains miniscule letters in the title.

CFJ 1352 "The last paragraph of rule 1969 does not prohibit transferring Bonds
          that have already been redeemed."
         4/21  Called by Sir Toby
         Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1966 says that Bonds of the same
           species are fungible, and takes precedence over Rule 1969, so
           redeemed Bonds cannot be distinguished from unredeemed Bonds of the
           same species.
