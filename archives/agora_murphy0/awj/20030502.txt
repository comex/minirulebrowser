ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Streamline complacency" by root - Proposal 4487 adopted 4/27
   If there are too few Oligarchs to meet quorum, then the Assessor may publish
     a Notice of Complacency before the end of the Voting Period.

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"ANF bugfixes" by Steve
    Significance (Historical, Hysterical, Ephemeral) is a Patent Title switch.
    Only Historical Patent Titles can gain points.
    Property of dissolute entities may be transferred to its Mintor or
      Recordkeepor, rather than to the Bank.
    If a type of Property ceases to exist, then debts in it cease to exist, and
      the former recordkeepor shall publish a closing report.
    Destroying a type of Property that you owe is the Crime of Writing Bad
      Checks.

"Fix Dereliction of Duty" by root - Proposal 4481 failed quorum 4/22 -
     Complacent Oligarchy - Proposal 4489
   Officers cited for Dereliction of Duty are removed, not retired.
   Blob is mauve.

"Fix PWIN V2" by Peekee - Proposal 4485 failed quorum 4/23 - Complacent
     Oligarchy - Proposal 4492
   PWIN is set to 100.  This repairs part of Rule 1990 (Points Contests)
     that was accidentally broken when Teams were introduced.

"More Useful Stem Weather" by OscarMeyr - Proposal 4482 failed quorum 4/22 -
     Complacent Oligarchy - Proposal 4490
   The destruction phase of Weather remains limited to the Bank's holdings,
     but the creation phase is no longer proportionally limited.

"Repeal Ohm's Law" by RedKnight
   Ohm's Law is repealed.

"Sink Arcadia" by Sherlock
   Repeal Rule 1999 (Entity Location), which "A New Front" missed repealing.

"Team Scores" by Peekee
   Team Points:
     +10 all vote on a democratic proposal
     -20 none vote on a democratic proposal
     +10 all vote unanimously FOR/AGAINST a democratic proposal
     +10 all vote in an election
     -20 none vote in an election
     +10 all vote for same candidate in an election
     +30 all rebellious and a revolt succeeds
     -30 all rebellious and a revolt fails
     + 5 all immaculate

"Team Shuffling" by Peekee - Proposal 4483 failed quorum 4/22 - Complacent
     Oligarchy - Proposal 4491
   Upon a Team Win, the highest-Scoring Player in the highest-Scoring Team
     is assigned to the lowest-Scoring Team, and the lowest-Scoring Player
     in the lowest-Scoring Team is assigned to even out Team sizes.  Ties
     are broken by the Scorekeepor's choice.

"Teams clean up" by Peekee - Proposal 4488
   Repeal Rule 112 (Ways to Win and Preclusions Thereof), since Player Wins
     have been replaced by Team Wins.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Generalize Ratification" by Murphy
   Restrictions on which documents may be ratified are no longer tied to
     ratification by proposal.
   Ratification by proposal is effective only if the document is valid when
     the proposal takes effect.

"Progressive Voting Potential" by Murphy
   Voting Potential may be increased from one value to another (within a 
month),
     rather than having to pay full cost to set it each time.

"Scorekeepor's Budget" by Peekee
   The Scorekeepor's Budget includes the Team Points Goal, PLIMIT, PPP, and
     Scoring Events.
   Initial Budget matches the current Rule 1930 (Scoring).
   Includes the effect of "Team Scores".

"Variable Terms of Service" by Murphy
   Terms of Service randomly vary in length from 2 to 4 months.

CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

*** Rule 1567 causes ineligibility by request to expire after one month ***

CFJ 1446 "The Proposal 'Try Again, Part 1 of 3' is distributable."

          4/25-29    Assigned to Peekee, who Judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Murphy claimed to rubberstamp, without
            specifying a method.  Later, e claimed that e had done it by paying
            a Fee of 0 Papyri.  During the week in which e claimed to
            rubberstamp, e had not previously rubberstamped anything.
          Judge's argument (summary):  A previous judgment indicates that Fees
            of zero cannot be paid.

CFJ 1447 "The Proposal 'Try Again, Part 2 of 3' is distributable."
[FALSE]  Linked to CFJ 1446
          3/2  Called by Murphy
          3/9-23     Assigned to Cecilius, who is recused
          3/31-4/14  Assigned to Blob, who is recused
          4/25-29    Assigned to Peekee, who Judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Murphy claimed to rubberstamp by paying
            a Fee of 0 Papyri.  During the week in which e made this claim, e
            had not previously rubberstamped anything.
          Judge's argument (summary):  A previous judgment indicates that Fees
            of zero cannot be paid.

CFJ 1449 "The Proposal entitled 'Full Discretion Fix' would have been
[TRUE]    Rubberstamped by the message sent by Cecilius today under the
Appealed  subject line 'Rubberstamping, Take Two,' if that Proposal had not
           already been Rubberstamped."
          Linked to CFJ 1448

          Judge Steve's refutation (summary):  Transfers (even of 0)
            require a valid Notice of Transfer, and a Notice of Transfer
            for 0 cannot be valid.
          Commentary:  A Rubberstamped Proposal may be Rubberstamped again.

[FALSE]   for at least one Officer to act as soon as possible [after the

          4/24-30  Assigned to Maud
          Judge's argument (summary):  Messages fail to communicate if they
            require excessive effort to interpret.  All Officers at the time
