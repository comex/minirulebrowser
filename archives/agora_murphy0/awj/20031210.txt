ERRATA
------

10/21  Goethe did not make emself ineligible to judge all CFJs, but rather
         any CFJs to which he was / is / will be assigned.  (Goethe 11/7)
       This ineligibility expired before a paradox had time to form.


ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"A Little Bribe Never Hurt Anyone" by Murphy - Proposal 4537 adopted 11/16
  Advertising is a stuck proposal switch with values none, positive, negative.
  A player may pay 2 Kudos to flip it from none to another value, or vice
    versa.
  If a player votes in line with a proposal's advertising, e gains 5 points.
  If a team votes unanimously in line with a proposal's advertising, they
    gain 10 points.  (Mixed votes, e.g. F+A from one member, are allowed.)

"Boon of Zeitgeist" by Murphy - Proposal 4535 failed quorum 11/16 - Complacent
    Oligarchy - Proposal 4540 adopted 11/23
  The Boon of Zeitgeist is given to the author of an Interested Democratic
    Proposal that is adopted with no AGAINST votes.

"Clean Up Oligarchy Removal, take 2" by OscarMeyr - Proposal 4534 adopted 11/8
  Duplicate of portions of "Clean Up Oligarchy Removal" which were
    ineffective due to typos in Rule numbers.
  Rule 1936 and 1963 no longer specify how to remove Oligarchs, which is now
    covered by Rule 2058; they only specify when to do it.

"Pragmatize Scoring" by Murphy - Proposal 4538 failed quorum 11/16 -
    Complacent Oligarchy - Proposal 4542 adopted 11/23
  Point awards from the Scorekeepor's Budget are pragmatically validated
    unless correctly challenged within 7 days.

"Remember Remember" by Goethe - Proposal 4539 adopted 11/16
  Parliamentary Votes are repealed.
  Chamber is a proposal switch.
  Proposals submitted on November 5 (Guy Fawkes Day) become Distributable,
    Democratic, Urgent, and Sane.  If adopted, the Proposer receives the Boon
    of A Penny.

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

"The Omnibus Reform Act of 2003" by Murphy - Proposal 4536 failed quorum 11/16
    - Complacent Oligarchy - Proposal 4541 Sanitized and aborted 11/23, then
    removed from Proposal Pool
  Orders cannot pile onto an already-required (in)action.
  The Scorekeepor's Budget treats Ephemeral Patent Titles differently.
  The Gamestate is retroactively fixed with respect to Boons of Teamwork in
    October.
  Player and Team Scores reset pragmatically only.
  One Team Win blocks any other concurrent Team Wins.
  Proto-Budget handling is tied to the end of the nominating period and the
    end of the election, rather than the voting period (since uncontested
    elections don't have a voting period).  The Gamestate is retroactively
    repaired as if this bug never prevented a Proto-Budget from taking effect.
  The Gamestate is retroactively fixed with respect to Oligarchic Terms of
    Service.

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Nondescript Proposal" by OscarMeyr - Contested Proposal 4543

"The Points of Champions" by Goethe
  Points Contests are repealed.
  If there is no Champion's Contest, the Scorekeepor or Speaker may (With 2
    Support) name one.
  The Contestmaster ceases to be a team member.  If e ceases to be
    Contestmaster of a Champion's Contest, e is assigned to a team as if e
    were a new player.
  The Champion's Contest begins with zero awardable points.  This is increased
    monthly by the Champion's Grant, part of the Scorekeepor's Budget,
    initially 60.
  The Champion's Contest may award its awardable points, according to its SLC.
  When a Team Win occurs, the Champion's Contest ceases to be a Champion's
    Contest (and loses all awardable points).

"Team Captains" by OscarMeyr - Proposal 4544
  Leadership is a team switch with values null, (the team's members).
  If a team's Leadership is null, any member may flip it Without Teammate
    Objection.
  If a team's Leadership is not null, the Team Captain (and Executor of the
    team) may flip it at will; any other member may flip it With N Supporters,
    where N+1 is a majority of the team's members.
  If the Team Captain leaves a team, its Leadership becomes null.

          Judge's argument (summary):  Eris' Contest did not exist until
