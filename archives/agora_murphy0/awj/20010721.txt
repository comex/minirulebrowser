ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Another Use for Indulgences" by Elysion - Proposal 4175 adopted 7/3
  A Player may pay 1 Indulgence to change eir Role after six weeks, or 3
    Indulgences to change it immediately.

"Auction Patches" by root - Proposal 4176 adopted 7/3
  Items are Auctioned in lots.
  The owner of an Auctioned lot incurs a debt for that lot to a winning Bidder,
    skipping the "pay out" mechanism.
  Vickrey Auctions don't say what happens if there are exactly as many
    uncancelled Bids as there are lots up for Auction.  In this case, the Final
    Auction Price is the Starting Bid.

"Bastille Day" by Oerjan - Proposal 4182 adopted 7/9
  On Bastille Day (July 14), each Rebel counts double toward the chance of
    success if e publicly hums a few bars of "La Marseillaise", but a
    successful Rebellion leaves each Rebel with one Blot (even if e was
    previously Immaculate).

"Don't be overkill" by Ziggy - Proposal 4185 adopted 7/17
  Oligardiness is reduced from a Class 2 to a Class 1 Infraction.

"Executors Revamped" by Steve - Proposal 4190 adopted 7/17
  An Executor may act on behalf of an Executee, but no longer "as if e is the
    Executee".
  Limited Executors is explicitly defined.
  Entities may have multiple Executors.
  An entity may have at most one Prime Executor with respect to a certain
    action.
  A Player is eir own Prime Executor by default.
  Power of Attorney is not withdrawn due to the Grantor going On Hold.
  The Holder of Power of Attorney is Prime Executor of the Grantor.
  The Treasuror is Prime Executor of the Bank, except for debts in a Bank
    Currency, for which the Recordkeepor is Prime Executor.
  Embezzlement covers all Property transfers not explicitly required or
    permitted by the Rules.
  Rules 947 (Bonus for Repeal), 1959 (Wills), and 1598 (Property Transfers) no
    longer explicitly mention Executors.
  Razl becomes Noisy.

"Fix Periodic Compensations" by Taral - Proposal 4179 adopted 7/3
  Salaries and Distributor's Gratuity require 16 (not 12) days of holding the
    appropriate position.

"Fix Unready Judges" by root - Proposal 4178 adopted 7/3
  A Player who becomes ineligible to Judge due to a Grace Period is treated as
    if e became ineligible by request; in particular, e may become eligible by
    request while still in eir Grace Period.

"Heroism is Catching" by Kelly - Proposal 4184 adopted 7/17
  Douglas Hofstadter becomes a Hero.

"Indulgence Auctions Happen" by Goethe - Proposal 4188 adopted 7/17
  The Monthly Bank Indulgence Gain (MBIG) is the number of Indulgences
    transferred to the Bank minus the number transferred from the Bank.
  If the Indulgence Differential is less than or equal to zero, then the Herald
    may Auction up to half the MBIG.

"LET'S GET THIS SHOW ON THE ROAD ALREADY" by Elysion - Proposal 4180 adopted
    7/3
  It takes 100 (not 200) Points to Win.

"Make Buying Democracy Easier" by neil - Proposal 4187 adopted 7/17
  An Untained Speaker may (With 3 Supporters) Sanitise an Ordinary Interested
    Proposal which no one has attempted to Democratise, making it Democratic
    and Sane.  If this happens during its Voting Period (which requires someone
    to pay 1 Papyrus), then all Votes are cancelled and the Voting Period is
    extended to seven days after the Sanitising.
  A Player may (With Support) attempt to Democratise an Ordinary Interesting
    Proposal.  This costs 0.1 VE except for an Untainted Speaker.  Until the
    end of the Voting Period, Players may pay VEs to Vote FOR or AGAINST
    Democratisation.  If FORs >= AGAINSTs, then all Votes are cancelled and the
    Voting Period is extended by seven days.

"Opposite Proposals" by neil - Proposal 4194 adopted 7/17
  Each time the Promotor distributes Proposals, e may randomly select one and
    add an Opposite Proposal to the distribution.  E may (Without 2 Objections)
    pay out 0.1 Papyri to emself for doing so.

"Points Contests" by Goethe - Proposal 4191 adopted 7/17
  A Points Contest is one whose ACO says it is.
  A Player can be Contestmaster of at most one Points Contest per month.
  Once per month, a Points Contest (that existed at the beginning of the month)
    may award Points to one or more Players, maximum PPP * NPC where
      PWIN = Points needed to win
      PPP  = PWIN / 20
      NPC  = Number of Players who were Contestants during past 14 days
  A Player may receive at most PWIN / 5 from all Points Contests; awards
    exceeding this limit are invalid for that Player only.

"Raffle Patch" by Elysion - Proposal 4177 adopted 7/3
  Players unable to Bid in an Auction cannot buy Raffle tickets either, if the
    Auction is a Raffle (which does not involve Bidding).

"Simplify Organizations" by Murphy - Proposal 4181 adopted 7/9
  Rule 1528 (Organizations) is simplified in language, mentions Administrators,
    and states that all required properties except Class may be changed by
    unanimous member consent.
  Rules 1614 (Organizations' Names) and 1612 (Organizations' SLCs) are
    simplified in language.
  A Rule is created that explicitly lists Classes of Organizations.
  Rule 1531 (Administrators and Their Duties) generally allows a Charter or
    another Rule to separate the identities of the Administrator, Maintainer,
    and Executor.
  Rules 1533 (Application to Create an Organization) and 1397 (Dissolution of
    Organizations) simply refer to the list of properties that Organizations
    are required to have, rather than reiterating the list.
  Rule 1617 (Changing the Jurisdiction of an Organization's SLC) is repealed,
    as it is now redundant with Rule 1528.

"Tax Avoidance" by Taral - Proposal 4193 adopted 7/17
  Rebels are only tax-exempt if they were Rebellious when the intent to tax was
    announced.

"The Neo-Oligarchy" by Elysion - Proposal 4186 rejected 7/17
  There may be any number of Oligarchs.  All Oligarchs have the Voting Power
    that Low Oligarchs currently have.
  Current Oligarchs become Elder Oligarchs for three months.  (The Rulekeepor
    may repeal this clause Without Objection if there are no Elder Oligarchs.)
  The GWotO's Budget includes the Oligarchy Auction Rate, from 1 to 4.  The
    GWotO may amend eir Budget Without 2 Oligarch Objections.
  Each month, the GWotO shall auction a number of Oligarchy positions equal to
    the Oligarchy Auction Rate, and shall bill each non-Elder Oligarch 0.1 VEs
    (and remove anyone who doesn't pay within seven days).
  Rebels remain in the Oligarchy on a successful Rebellion.

"The Scribes' Council" by Kelly - Proposal 4174 adopted 7/3
  The Scribes' Council is the set of all Scribes.
  A Player may make a Proposal Distributable for free with the support of a
    majority of the Scribes' Council.

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

7/7  Promotor Elysion aborts Proposal 4169 ("Fix Rule 1686"); Syllepsis's
       attempt to Disinterest it was sent to agora-business@agoranomic.org,
       which was not yet a Public Forum at the time, and so it was never
       Distributable.  Whether this invalidates the effect of Proposal 4169's
       adoption is unclear.

"Fix of the Fix" by Elysion - Proposal 4183 rejected 7/9
  Double Papyrus awards due to Proposal 4168 (because the old New Player Award
    was accompanied by a 1-Papyrus bonus, but it was not part of the NPA) are
    revoked.

"INFLUENZA" by harvel - Proposal 4189 rejected 7/17
  Each week, the Promotor randomly selects a message sent to a Discussion Forum
    of eir choice during the previous weeks, and adds it to the Pool as a
    Democratic, Distributable Proposal with AI=1, authored by the author of the
    message.  If the Proposal is adopted, then the Promotor shall pay out 0.1
    Papyri to the author.

"Lobbyists and Butterfly Ballots" by Murphy - Proposal 4192 rejected 7/17
  Butterfly Ballots are similar to Voting Entitlements, granting additional
    Votes on Referenda (and Elections, the Voting portions of which are
    actually a special form of Referenda).
  All new Players since January 1, 2001, shall receive 0.5 BBs.

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Clarify Discussion Forum" by Murphy
  A message sent to a Discussion Forum may be considered to have been sent to
    all Players (usually because it was simultaneously sent to a Public Forum).

"Entitling Oligarchs" by Goethe
  Oligarch Auction bids are in VEs, not Stems.
  The MUQ of VEs is reduced from 0.1 to 0.01.
  Ideal VE circulation is increased from 1 VE per Player to (1 + New Player
    Award in VEs) VE per Player.
  VEs are still Auctioned in 0.1 VE blocks.

"Fix Bank Debt Bugs" by Murphy
  Rule 1946 (Distribution of Voting Entitlements) loses an incorrect clause
    that each winning Bidder gets 1.0 rather than 0.1 VE.
  The Registrar pays out New Player Awards, rather than Ordering the Treasuror
    to do so.

"Fix Credit Limits" by neil - Proposal 4196
  Non-Players have Credit Limits.

"Forgive Buggy VE Debts" by Murphy
  All outstanding VE debts arising from Rule 1946 prior to July 14 are forgiven
    (because Rule 1946 incorrectly awards 1.0 VE per bid, instead of 0.1 VE).

"Good Agoran Rewards" by solublefish
  Kudos are a Currency.  The Recordkeepor is the Herald.  The MUQ is 0.1.
  The Mentor's Bonus is 4 Kudos.
  The Speaker's Patronage is 1 Kudo.
  Agora's Birthday gives 1 Kudo to each Player, 0.5 Kudo to each Player who
    recognizes it, and 2 Kudos to each worthy Contest.
  The Bonus for Repeal is 1 Kudo.
  Each candidate in an Election receives extra Votes equal to eir Kudos at the
    beginning of the Election, and is then billed for those Kudos.

"Increase VE Supply" by Murphy
  Ideal VE circulation is increased from 1 VE per Player to (1 + New Player
    Award in VEs) VE per Player.
  Unique Patent Title of Claim Jumper is awarded to the Player with the most
    VEs (minimum three).

"Liquify the Bank" by Kelly
  The Bank shall mint Currency when properly Ordered to do so.
  The Treasuror is Ordered to mint 15 Voting Entitlements.

"Make Proposing Easier" by Syllepsis
  The base Distribution Cost of a Proposal is lowered from 1 to 0.5 Papyri.
  The additional Distribution Cost for making a Proposal Urgent is lowered from
    1 to 0.5 Papyri.

"Poor Man's Agora" by Syllepsis - Proposal 4195
  A Sanctimonious Player is one who meets all these conditions:
    * Not a Zombie.
    * Possesses less than 4 times Basic Officer Salary in Stems.
    * Possesses no VEs.
    * Is not Executor or Limited Executor of any entity (other than Bank or
        Monastery) violating the above conditions.
    * Is a Senator.
    * Is Immaculate.
  A Player who is Sanctimonious for at least a week becomes a Monk by notifying
    the Registrar that e does so.
  A Monk who is not Sanctimonious for at least 48 hours ceases to be a Monk at
    the beginning of the week after a Player notifies the Registrar of it.
  Monks may make Proposals Distributable for half-price.

"Raising the Dead" by Goethe
  Only Acolytes may bid in Zombie Auctions.

"Rapid Mutation" by Murphy
  Stems become generally transferrable.

"Read the Ruleset Week" by harvel
  An index of 4 is greater than any other index (including Unanimity).

  harvel is the one and only Emperor.
  This Rule may not be repealed or amended.  
  This Rule takes precedence over every other Rule.

"Remove Roles" by Elysion
  Roles are repealed.

"The Virus, Mark III" by Murphy
  Each week, a random Rule becomes ineffective for two weeks.  (Rules with AI>1
    are immune.)

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"AIDS" by Goethe
  <"ICK!  BLEACH!  BARF!  BLOOEY!  NI! NI! NI!"  Please consult the a-d archive
    for July 2, but don't say we didn't warn you.>

"A Mutating Virus" and "A Better Mutating Virus" by Syllepsis
  <We couldn't get either of these to hold still long enough to commit them to
    printed form.  Please consult the a-d archive for June 28 and July 1.>

"AND/OR" by Syllepsis
  During July and August, all other Power=1 Rules have the meanings of "and"
    and "or" switched.

"Antibodies" by Goethe
  If a Rule automatically changes the text of a different Rule, then the change
    is immediately removed.

"a simple middle ground" by Goethe
  Each Player may make one Proposal per month Distributable for free (if its
    Distribution Cost was 1 Papyrus).

"Decrease MUQs" by neil
  The MUQs of Papyri, VEs, and Indulgences are divided by 10.
  Credit Limits are still restricted to the same ranges.
  VEs are still Auctioned in 0.1 VE blocks.

"Fix Rule 1981" by Murphy
  A valid but unauthorized transfer causes the Payee to owe a return to the
    Payor.  (Currently, e owes it to the Bank, regardless of who the Payor is.)

"Give Recordkeepors Auction Control" by harvel
  Each Bank Currency (other than Stems) has an Ideal Circulation Level, an
    Actual Circulation Level, a Formula, and an Item Size.
  The Recordkeepor of a Currency may create a Formula (if there is none), or
    (Without Objection) modify the Formula.
  The Item Size is a multiple of the MUQ.
  Each month, if ACL > ICL, then the difference is Auctioned in blocks equal to
    the Item Size.

"Group Roles" by Murphy
  Groups with at least three members may have Roles.

"Insolvency" by Syllepsis
  When the Bank's debts in a Currency exceed its holdings, any Executor or
    Limited Executor able to levy a tax in that Currency must levy a tax
    sufficient to make up the difference (or else levy the maximum possible
    tax with no exemptions).

"Judicial Reform, Part 1 of 2" by Murphy
  Rule 991 (Invoking Judgement) picks up the core of Rule 1563 (Statement of a
    CFJ), which is then repealed.

"Judicial Reform, Part 2 of 2" by Murphy
  A CFJ may be filed with the Justiciar for any reason, though this is not
    recommended in the general case.
  Rules 897 (Barring Players from Judgement), 1562 (Excess CFJs), 1868
    (Selecting a Judge), 408 (Late Judgement), 591 (Legal Judgements), 1575
    (Standards of Proof) have their language simplified.
  Rule 698 (Always an Eligible Judge) is reworded to restore eligibility to
    groups of Players at a time, rather than changing the overall eligibility
    formula at each step.
  Rule 1756 (Delinquent Judges) is repealed.
  Linked CFJs are Judged by a single Judge.
  Caller must submit evidence when accusing a Player of shirking a duty.
  DISMISSED is a Judgement.  Other Rules are adjusted accordingly.
  Justices become Appelate Judges, as opposed to Trial Judges.
  Rule 1447 (Final Judgement upon Appeal) is split into three parts:  how soon
    a Justice must determine, what determinations e may make, and what e is
    paid for determining on time.
  Board of Appeals may overturn and remand to original Judge for re-Judgement.
  Rule 908 (Formal Apologies) picks up the text of Rule 1832 (Failure to
    Apologize), which is then repealed.

"Modest Oligarch Upkeep" by Goethe
  Oligarchs pay monthly upkeep equal to the winning bid from the latest
    Oligarch Auction divided by the number of positions (occupied or vacant) in
    the Oligarchy.  Those who became Oligarchs during the previous month are
    exempt.  Those who don't pay ASAP shall have the debt forgiven, but shall
    be removed from the Oligarchy.

"NEPSTER 2001" by t
  Stems become Yoyos, with amounts divided by five.
  The Payroll Clerk pays out 10 Yoyos to emself.
  The Bank is no longer restricted in minting Bank Currencies.
  Roles are repealed.
  Bonds are repealed.
  Rebellion no longer carries a Stem (Yoyo) award.

"Platforms for Scorekeepors" by root
  The Scorekeepor's Budget contains the Goal (a positive integer), and a Point
    award/penalty for each event defined by the Rules as Scoreworthy, and up to
    three other events.
  All Point awards/penalties are integers from 0 to 30, and the average may be
    at most 10.

"Proposal Lottery" by Blob
  Each week, before the Promotor distributes any Proposals, a random Player
    with one or more Undistributable Proposals (excluding the Promotor emself)
    gets a random one of those Proposals made Distributable for free.

"Repeal Bonds" by Murphy
  All Bonds are accelerated and then destroyed.
  All Rules pertaining to Bonds are repealed.

"Sucked Dry and Tossed Aside" by Murphy
  Additional Votes on Proposals may be bought by spending 0.1 VE per Vote.
  If "Lobbyists and Butterfly Ballots" was adopted, then additional Votes on
    non-Proposal Issues may be bought by spending 0.1 BB per Vote.

"Wisdom" by Goethe
  A Player becomes a Sage or ceases to be a Sage by announcing such.  Being a
    Sage and being eligible to Judge CFJs are mutually exclusive.  The Clerk of
    the Courts cannot become a Sage.
  The Sacred Keepor of the Holy Agoran Order of Wisdom (Sacred KHAOW) is an
    Officer who maintains the Body of Agoran Wisdom (similar to the Ruleset)
    and a list of Sages.
  The Book of Wisdom constitutes judicial precedent.
  The Tree of Wisdom indicates precedence between other entries.
  A Player may Seek Wisdom by paying a Papyrus fee (part of the Treasuror's
    Budget), or With Support from the Sacred KHAOW, the Justiciar, the Speaker,
    or any two Players.  Eir question(s) are treated similarly to CFJs, with
    the Sacred KHAOW acting as the Clerk of the Courts.  The Sage's Revelation
    of Truth is added to the Book of Wisdom.
  If Distilled Wisdom is requested, then the Sage's Revelation of Truth may
    only be Yes, No, or Depends.  Otherwise, e may reveal Undistilled Wisdom.
  With Support from the Speaker, the Justiciar, or any two Players, a Player
    seeking Distilled Wisdom may list one or more Entries or CFJs, and request
    their Synthesis.  The Sage may adjust the list With Support in the same
    fashion.  The Sage's Ponderings are added to the Tree of Wisdom.
  With Support, a Judge or Justice may Seek Wisdom for free.  Eir requirement
    to make a judicial finding is postponed till ASAP after the Sage Reveals.
  With Support, the submitter of a CFJ that was dismissed (and the dismissal is
    not pending Appeal) may Seek Distilled Wisdom on the Statement's truth for
    free.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1303  "Razl is Noisy."
[FALSE]   6/24     Called by Goethe
          6/24-30  Assigned to Blob, who Judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Steve, who has Power of Attorney over
            Razl, claimed to cause Razl to make emself Noisy.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  A Player becomes Noisy by posting to
            the Public Forum, not by claiming to become Noisy.

CFJ 1304  "If the Executor of an entity posts to the Public Forum - clearly
[FALSE]    stating that e posts to the Public Forum on behalf of the entity,
           as if e were the entity - then the entity is considered to have
           posted to the Public Forum."
          6/26      Called by Murphy
          6/30-7/7  Assigned to Taral, who Judges FALSE
          Judge's refutation (summary):  In Rule 1478, the phrase "as if e were
            the entity" does not deem that the entity has acted, but rather
            that the Executor has acted on the entity's behalf.

CFJ 1305  "A Player, while on Hold, may not be made silent by Rule 1042 until
[TRUE]     two months after going on Hold."
          7/3    Called by Goethe
          7/3-5  Assigned to pTang, who Judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1042 specifies two ways to become
            silent:  be Quiet two weeks, or be Inactive two months.  For
            Inactive Players, the latter takes precedence.
          Judge's commentary (summary):  There is neither conflict nor
            precedence between Rule 1042's methods; either may apply.  However,
            the first method implicitly requires the Quiet Player to post and
            thus become Noisy, and does not explicitly apply itself to Inactive
            Players, so Rule 1584 makes it ineffective.

CFJ 1306  "The Basic Officer Salary is 50 Stems."
[TRUE]    7/5    Called by Murphy
          7/5-8  Assigned to lee, who is recused
          7/8    Reassigned to Oerjan, who Judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1893 specifies a new procedure
            (Without Objection) for the Treasuror to change eir Budget, but
            does not specify that it replaces the procedure (With Support) of
            Rule 1957.

CFJ 1307  "Annabel's message, on or about 31 May 2001, reading in part 'So I
           transfer all of my currencies to the Bank, and then deregister' did
           not have the effect of transferring any Currencies."
          7/10  Called by Kelly
          7/14  Assigned to Evantine
          Caller's argument (summary):  The argument for CFJ 1302 applies.
          Counterargument:  It is reasonable to assume that Annabel knew that e
            possessed some sort of Currency, and thus that e definitely
            intended to make one or more transfers.  "all of my currencies"
            then constitutes a specification.  CFJ 1302 referred to a statement
            of the form "if X, then I transfer Y"; in that case, it was
            reasonable to assume that the Player considered it possible for X
            to be false, and thus that e possibly intended not to make any
            transfer.

CFJ 1308  "If a non-Player entity may Vote on an Insane Proposal, then it may
           do so in public."
          7/11  Called by Murphy
          7/14  Assigned to Peekee
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1729 does not explicitly prohibit
            non-Players from Voting on an Insane Proposal in public, though it
            does blanket-prohibit discussion of such Votes during the Voting
            Period.
          Commentary:  False if the Voting Mode on Proposals is Private.  But
            at the time of the CFJ, the Voting Mode on Proposals was Public.

CFJ 1309  "If the Vizier of a Group casts on behalf of the Group one or more
           votes on an Insane Proposal in a Public Forum, e has not thereby
           bended or violated Rule 1729.".
          7/14  Called by harvel
          7/14  harvel requests annotation of Rule 1729
          7/15  Assigned to Syllepsis

CFJ 1310  "Proposal 4168 caused Ian, root, and solublefish to owe the Bank 120
           Stems."
          7/10  Called by Syllepsis
          7/16  Assigned to solublefish

CFJ 1311  "No Proposals have passed during the current Nomic Week."
[FALSE]   7/18  Called by Goethe
          7/18  Assigned to Steve, who Judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  At the time of this CFJ, the adoption
            of some recent Proposals had been announced by ex-Assessor Blob,
            but not by Assessor Goethe.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  The Proposals passed at the end of the
            Voting Period.  Their taking effect is what depends on the
            Assessor's announcement.

ERRATA
------

Goethe failed to create the Currency "Fish" on April 8 because e failed to
  specify its Recordkeepor.  (Rule 1722:  "states in that message the values of
  all properties which the Rules require of Currencies")


-- 
Ed Murphy <ford@jps.net>     http://members.fortunecity.com/emurphy/
          "Most of the time, it seemed sublimely unaware of its limbs,
           though it was beginning to suspect it had hands."
