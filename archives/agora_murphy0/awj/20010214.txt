ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Clarify R1447" by Steve - Proposal 4109 adopted 2/11
  A late Justice is immediately recused from the Board.  Rule 1447 is currently
    ambiguous as to whether recusal is caused by lateness or by reporting the
    Infraction.

"Patent Titles Aren't Property!" by Ziggy - Proposal 4110 adopted 2/11
  In the Rules, "possess" and "own" refer only to Property.
  Patent Titles and Win Conditions are "borne", not "possessed".

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Banking Developments" by t
  Bank Currency Recordkeepors may create and destroy that Currency in the
    Bank's holdings.
  Debts owed by the Bank must be announced before the Bank is obligated to pay
    them.

"Clarify Rule 459" by Elysion
  The Nomic Week begins at the beginning of Monday.

"Oligarchy Reform" (was "Undo Proposal 4104") by Elysion - Proposal 4111
  Proposal 4104 (if adopted; see CFJ 1261) causes all Proposals to have an
    Adoption Index of 1, but a Power equal to their Voting Index.  A side
    effect is that all Proposals are Ordinary by default.  This proto undoes
    that change, and increases Rule 594's (Proposals and Rule Changes) Power
    to 2.
  An Oligarch may resign by announcing that e does so.
  Rule 1933 (Ordinary and Democratic Proposals) is amended to avoid the
    problematic "operation of" text.
  An Ordinary Proposal that fails quorum becomes Democratic, and its Voting
    Period is extended accordingly.

"VE Upkeep" by Blob
  The Treasuror's Budget contains the VE Upkeep, which is from 0 to 2 times the
    Basic Officer's Salary.
  At the beginning of the second month of each quarter, the Assessor bills each
    non-Bank entity for the VE Upkeep for each VE it owns.  If such a debt
    remains outstanding for a week, the Assessor may forgive that debt and bill
    the entity for a VE instead.  (This clock stops running while the debt is
    disputed or the Player is On Hold.)

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Clarity of Communication" by Goethe
  A Communication is a single declaration with a specific effect.
  A Communication has effect only if it has exactly one reasonable
    interpretation.
  A message is a (possibly empty) set of Collections to be sent to a Public
    Forum.
  A message's Communications have effect only if they have an unambiguous
    order.

"Group Voting" by Blob
  Players may transfer Stems to eir Group.
  A Group at least three months old may have a Role.
  A Group may bid according to eir Role (except in Oligarch Auctions).

"The Oligarch-on-Deck" by Murphy
  The Oligarch-on-Deck is a separately Auctioned position, whose holder
    automatically fills one vacancy in the Oligarchy as soon as it arises.

"The Oligarcqueue" by t
  The Oligarcqueue is an ordered list of Players, possibly including duplicate
    entries.  New entries are appended to the end.  Non-Players, Zombies, and
    the Speaker are removed.
  The Oligarchy is the first six names in the Oligarcqueue.  The first name is
    the High Oligarch, the next two are Middle Oligarchs, and the next three
    are Low Oligarchs.
  At least one place in the Oligarcqueue is Auctioned monthly.  If there are
    less than six Oligarchs, then enough places must be Auctioned to fill it.
  A successful Rebellion removes all Oligarchs from the Oligarcqueue.
  Players in the Oligarcqueue but not the Oligarchy are billed the Oligarcqueue
    Rate (normally half the Minimum Income), or may give up eir Oligarcqueue
    position(s) to have this debt forgiven.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1259  "If this statement is true, Peekee is owed 100 Stems."
Dismissed 1/18     Called by Peekee
          1/18-29  Assigned to Murphy, who dismisses it
          2/5      Peekee submits Application to Submit Concurring Opinion
          2/6      Peekee executes Application to Submit Dissenting Opinion (e
                     pasted from the wrong file); it has no effect because it
                     lacks Signatures
          2/10     Appealed by Razl
          Caller's argument (summary):  FALSE would be self-contradictory.
          Judge's argument (summary):  TRUE would falsely imply that Peekee was
            owed 100 Stems.  Dismissed per Rule 1565 ii).
          Peekee's attempted Concurring Opinion (summary):  The statement *can*
            logically admit to being TRUE - in a hypothetical universe in which
            Peekee is owed 100 Stems.  However, Rule 1563 requires the
            statement to *actually be* either TRUE or FALSE, and provides valid
            grounds for dismissal.
          Counterargument:  Rule 1565 ii) may be interpreted as "Its Statement
            (can not logically admit to being TRUE) or (can not logically admit
            to being FALSE)", the latter clause of which applies to this CFJ.

CFJ 1261  "Proposal 4104 passed."
[FALSE]   1/23     Called by Elysion
          1/23-29  Assigned to harvel, who Judges FALSE
          2/1      Appealed by t
          2/5      Ziggy Moves to revoke Elysion's 4 Points for the adoption
          2/6-10   Motion assigned to harvel, who grants it
          Commentary:  Elysion and Assessor t established a private code
            equating AGAINT with FOR.  Elysion then claimed to Vote 3xAGAINT
            Proposal 4104.  If AGAINT is an obvious synonym of FOR, then the
            Statement is TRUE; otherwise, whether Elysion Voted 3xAGAINST or
            did not Vote at all, the Statement is FALSE.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  AGAINT is ambiguous - it could have
            coded for FOR, or been a misspelling of AGAINST - hence the
            Assessor was not informed of Votes, hence no Votes were cast.
          Counterargument:  The Assessor must always interpret Votes received.

CFJ 1265  "The Justiciar is required by the Rules to act in some way in
Dismissed  response to the Call for Judgement earlier in this email."
          2/4  Called by Wes
          2/4  Assigned to Kelly
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 991 (requiring the Clerk of the
            Courts to act upon a submitted CFJ) takes precedence over Rule 1831
            (requiring the Justiciar to perform the duties of the Clerk of the
            Courts for CFJs filed with em).
          Judge's argument (summary):  The statement of this CFJ may appear in
            different messages, so 'this email' does not have a fixed meaning.
          Counterargument:  It did have a fixed meaning at the time this CFJ
            was called, which is the only time relevant to Judgement.

CFJ 1266  "1.  That of the following two messages, 
Dismissed  http://www.escribe.com/games/agora-business/m2253.html
Appealed   and
           http://www.escribe.com/games/agora-business/m2255.html
           exactly ONE legally registered Goethe as a player in the game of 
           Agora. The other one is either incorrect or superfluous.
           2.  That at a time 1 minute immediately BEFORE the SEND date 
           listed in Goethe's e-mail header for m2253, normalized to GMT as 
           Feb 5 0:22:49 (anecdotal evidence available on request), Goethe 
           unambiguously was NOT a player.
           3.  That at a time 1 minute immediately AFTER the latest 
           distribution date of m2255 listed in e-scribe, normalized to GMT 
           as Feb 5 as 1:19:24, Goethe unambiguously WAS a player.
           4.  That, from these time indications, rounding to the minute, 
           Goethe's Window of Ambiguity of Status as Player (GWASP) extends 
           ABSOLUTELY NO LONGER than between GMT 0:21:00 and GMT 1:21:00 on 
           Feb 5, 2001.
           5.  That Goethe's instant of becoming a player lies unambiguously 
           within es GWASP.
           5.  While judgements on timestamps or the legality of the first 
           message (c.f. http://www.escribe.com/games/agora-official/m967.html)
           may narrow the extent of this GWASP, no judgement may extend it.
           6.  Therefore, irrespective of the EXACT moment of Goethe's 
           registration, and independent of any decisions further refining 
           the exact moment, any game events, payments or adjustments, 
           mandated by the rules to occur to Goethe's status, which must 
           happen WITHIN a time period following registration, must use a 
           registration date for Goethe NO LATER THAN 1:21:00 Feb. 5, 2001 in 
           determining time of occurrence.
           7.  Likewise, any game events, payments, or adjustments mandated 
           by the rules to occur a certain time AFTER Goethe's registration 
           must use a registration date for Goethe NO EARLIER THAN 0:21:00 
           Feb. 5, 2001 in determining its time of occurrence."
          2/6    Called by Goethe
          2/7    Assigned to Crito, who dismisses it
          2/7-8  Appealed by Kelly, Ziggy, lee, and harvel
          2/9    Appeal assigned to Chuck, Steve, and Wes
          2/12   Steve moves to sustain

CFJ 1268  "Peekee has committed the Crime of Application Fraud as described in
[TRUE]     Rule 1626 by claiming that eir Application (included in Evidence
Appealed   below) was signed by Players who did not actually sign that
           Application."
          2/7   Called by Wes
          2/7   Assigned to lee, who Judges TRUE
          2/8   Appealed by Peekee
          2/10  Appeal assigned to Chuck, Steve, and Wes
          Caller's argument (summary):  Peekee published a Dissenting Position,
            then changed it to Consenting and got some signatures, then
            mistakenly sen the Dissenting copy.

CFJ 1269  <Identical to CFJ 1270 - Syllepsis sent three separate copies of eir
[FALSE]    message - and Judged FALSE by Elysion, for the same reason as Ziggy>

CFJ 1270  "There is no ordering to the statements 'I become a scribe.' and 
[FALSE]    'I become a politician.' in first message in which Syllepsis so 
           stated them."
          2/6   Called by Syllepsis
          2/10  Assigned to Ziggy, who Judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  The two statements started and ended
            with the same characters, and neither one is consistently to one
            side of the other.
          Judge Ziggy's refutation (summary):  There are multiple (albeit
            mutually inconsistent) orderings.

CFJ 1271  <Identical to CFJ 1270 - Syllepsis sent three separate copies of eir
[FALSE]    message - and Judged FALSE by Wes, for the same reason as Ziggy>

CFJ 1272  "All Players always have at least one inherent right, regardless of 
           any rule (for purposes of this statement, inherent right means a 
           right that players have even when or if the rules do not explicitly 
           grant them that right)."
          2/11  Called by Evantine
          2/11  Assigned to Chuck
          Caller's argument (summary):  A Player can quit, even if the Rules
            forbid it.
          Counterargument:  The Zombies have "quit", but the Rules still regard
            them as Players.

CFJ 1273  "An Appeal has been initiated with regards to CFJ 1266."
[TRUE]    2/12     Called by Wes
          2/12-13  Assigned to Goethe, who Judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1564 does not explicitly permit
            the Appeal of a Dismissal, hence this should be false.
          Counterargument:  Dismissing a CFJ rather than Judging it may be a
            "duty of a Judicial nature which e was required to perform".
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Dismissing a CFJ rather than Judging
            it is a "duty of a Judicial nature which e was required to
            perform".
