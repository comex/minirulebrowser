CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1125  "Rule 1883 has not been repealed."
[TRUE]    4/24       Called by Blob
Appealed  4/26-30    Assigned to Crito, who Judges TRUE
          4/30-5/30  Appealed by Steve, elJefe, and Kolja A.
          6/7        Appeal assigned to Blob, Steve, and Michael
          6/10       Michael moves to sustain
          Caller's argument (summary):  "An Object Lesson" was embedded
            in a spam message, so did not give a "clear indication" of
            being a Proposal as required by Rule 1483.

CFJ 1136  "Wes is currently not in eir grace period."
[FALSE]   5/21  Called by Kolja A.
          5/30  Assigned to Elysion
          Caller's argument (summary):  It has been suggested that Wes
            is General Chaos.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  These suggestions are not
            supported by substantial evidence.  Wes's behavior is
            consistent with that of an entity who has not recently
            been a Player.

CFJ 1137  "If a CFJ alleging that a Player has committed a Crime is
           initially Judged FALSE, and that decision is later reversed
           by a Board of Appeals, it is the duty of the original Judge
           to issue the Sentencing Orders associated with conviction of
           that Crime."
          5/25  Called by Chuck
          6/9   Assigned to Crito

      Notes on the apparent status of the Treasuror Election:
        * It should not have been initiated.  Rule 1892 (The Treasuror)
          claims precedence over Rule 790 (Filling Vacant Offices).
        * Rules 1445 (Defaults for Elections) and 1558 (Defaults for
          Elections for Offices) do not necessarily apply to Elections
          not required by the Rules, but Registrar Michael applies them
          anyway.
