  Instances of "flip" or "switch" are changed to "set".  "Flipping" is used

  New Card element Asleep (same as Delayed, except you are limited by anyone
    playing the card recently, not just yourself).

    become Piratical become democratic and sane.
  If a proposal is Piratical at the end of its voting period, and specifies a
    set of Raiders at least a Minimal Crew (one-third the number of active
    noisy players) but no more than twice a Minimal Crew, then the Raiders

    by the Assistant Director of Personnel.  E and the Speaker may flip an
    office with 2 support and without 2 objections.

    eir Arch Nemesis to null.
  If Alice's Arch Nemesis is Bob, then Alice is Bob's Harasser.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Begone, Speaker-elect" by Goethe
  Replace Speaker-Elect with Pope.
  A player who Wins becomes a pope.  While a pope exists, no other player can
    become a pope.
  A Speaker Transition occurs when a player becomes a pope, or when a player
    correctly announces that no player has become a pope for over six months.
  If a Speaker Transition occurs and there is no pope, then a conclave
    commences; cardinals are all ready players except the Speaker and Assistant
    Director of Personnel.  The ADoP shall open the conclave by announcing the
    name of one cardinal; one week later, the cardinal with the most
    un-withdrawn support (ties go to the ADoP's pick) becomes a pope.
  If two or more players Win simultaneously, then a conclave occurs, and all
    cardinals who Won are deemed to have initial support equal to a democratic
    quorum of players.

  Notice of Lawlessness begins Lynching.  Herald shall confirm accuracy,
    remove Lawless player from all offices (a Speaker Transition occurs if e
    is the Speaker), and publish a Notice of Intent to Deregister.  If the
    Notice of Lawlessness remains valid for a week, then the Herald shall
    deregister the Lawless player.

CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

Requests for ineligibility:

4/17 Quazie (Linked CFJs)
4/25 Sherlock (all)

CFJ 1533  "Rule 1561 cannot prevent an adopted Rule Change from taking effect."
[FALSE]   3/6      Called by Goethe
          3/13-20  Assigned to Sir Toby, who is recused
          3/20-27  Assigned to Murphy, who judges FALSE
          3/27-31  Appealed by Goethe, Sherlock, root, and Maud
          4/3-6    Appeal assigned to root, Eris, and OscarMeyr, who move
                     to REMAND
          4/15     Murphy judges TRUE (unintentionally)
          4/15     Appealed by Murphy, Quazie, root, and Goethe
          4/15     Appeal assigned to root, Eris, and Manu
          4/15     root and Manu move to REMAND
          4/17     Eris moves to REVERSE
          4/18     Murphy judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 107 (Rule Changes Must Be Written
            Down) takes precedence over it, and says that adopted proposals
            guide play.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Guiding play is not the same as
            determining play; "guiding play" is satisfied by triggering the
            evaluation of the rules determining the effects of adopted
            proposals, with the specified proposal text as input.
          Judge's second refutation (summary):  Adopted proposals guide play
            by activating Rules 107 and 594 (Power and Proposals), but are
            blocked from further effect by Rule 1561.

CFJ 1538  "A successful play of the Corporate Bankruptcy card causes any
[TRUE]     shares cards not in the Deck to be discarded."
          4/7     Called by Goethe
          4/9-17  Assigned to Riail, who judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Corporate Bankruptcy causes them to be
            "returned" to the Deck, but not explicitly discarded (i.e.
            transferred to the Deck).

CFJ 1539  "On or about Sun, 10 Apr 2005 23:46:45 -0400, root submitted a
[FALSE]    Call for Judgement."
          4/15     Called by Murphy; part of Linked CFJs 1539-41
          4/15-18  Assigned to Goethe, who judges FALSE
          Commentary:  root announced that e sued Quazie for attempting to
            declare Presence on Ordinary Proposals, and claimed that it was
            equivalent to a CFJ with the statement "[Quazie] attempted to
            declare Presence on several Ordinary proposals" and a Motion to
            Order em not to do it again.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  "lawsuit" is an ambiguous synonym
            for "CFJ", and the statement is ambiguous.

CFJ 1540  "On or about Sun, 10 Apr 2005 23:46:45 -0400, root submitted a
[FALSE]    Call for Judgement with the statement 'e attempted to declare
           Presence on several Ordinary proposals'."
          4/15     Called by Murphy; part of Linked CFJs 1539-41
          4/15-18  Assigned to Goethe, who judges FALSE
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Trivial given CFJ 1539.

CFJ 1541  "On or about Sun, 10 Apr 2005 23:46:45 -0400, root submitted a
[FALSE]    Call for Judgement with the statement 'Quazie attempted to
           declare Presence on several Ordinary proposals'."
          4/15     Called by Murphy; part of Linked CFJs 1539-41
          4/15-18  Assigned to Goethe, who judges FALSE
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Trivial given CFJ 1539.

CFJ 1542  "The rules currently define no card with the caption 'Your Turn'."
[FALSE]   4/12     Called by Kolja
          4/15-19  Assigned to Sherlock, who judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 2076 (Card cards) does not
            explicitly say that the text defines a card.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Rule 2069 (Card Definitions) says
            that a rule specifying a Caption and Quota is sufficient to define
            a card.  Rule 2076 meets both requirements (Caption directly,
            Quota by defining Your Turn as Budgeted).

CFJ 1543  "Quazie's order to Goethe, ordering Goethe to dance, was a valid
[TRUE]     order"
          4/14     Called by Quazie
          4/19-24  Assigned to Maud, who judges TRUE
          Judge's argument (summary):  Rule 1796 (Validity of Orders) says
            that all private orders are valid, and no rule says otherwise
            (until/unless proven otherwise by CFJ, which has not happened).

CFJ 1544  "Quazie's order to Goethe, ordering Goethe to publicly announce
[TRUE]     that e is a Ninny, was a valid order"
          4/14     Called by Quazie
          4/19-21  Assigned to Kolja, who judges TRUE

CFJ 1545  "Goethe's order to Quazie, ordering Quazie to withdraw eir orders
DISMISS    because they were invalid, was a valid order"
          4/14     Called by Quazie
          4/19-25  Assigned to Sherlock, who makes emself ineligible
          4/26     Assigned to Murphy, who DISMISSes it
          Judge's argument (summary):  The CFJ fails to correctly describe
            any of Goethe's orders.  It could only have reasonably intended to
            describe one order, but that order ordered Quazie to withdraw eir
            orders because they were improper (not invalid).

CFJ 1546  "In reports and distributions, the Promotor is permitted to add
[TRUE]     or delete whitespace or other formatting text to or from a
           proposal, provided that the substance of the proposal is not
           altered."
          4/14     Called by root
          4/15-20  Assigned to Kolja, who judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  May follow from the same line of
            reasoning as a similar judgement regarding the Rulekeepor.

CFJ 1547  "Multiple CFJs are not linked unless they are clearly labelled as
[TRUE]     Linked CFJs within the message in which they are submitted."
          4/15     Called by Murphy
          4/15-20  Assigned to Michael, who judges TRUE
          Commentary:  Quazie submitted three CFJs in one message, then
            attempted to link them in another message.

CFJ 1548  "root successfully played 'drop your weapon' on saturday april 16th"
          4/17     Called by Quazie
          4/18-27  Assigned to Riail, who is recused
          4/27     Assigned to root
          Caller's argument (summary):  root named a player and card, but did
            not explicitly use any form of the word "choose".

CFJ 1549  "When a proposal is aborted, its voting period immediately ends,
[TRUE]     if it has not ended already."
          4/18     Called by root; part of Linked CFJs 1549-53
          4/18-21  Assigned to OscarMeyr, who judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 693 (Prescribed Voting Period)
            allows other rules to change the length of the voting period for
            classes of proposals, but Rule 2033 (Aborting a Proposal) does not
            directly change the length (it changes the end time).  Also, Rule
            106 (Adopting Proposals) may somehow require uniform length within
            a class.
          Judge's argument (summary):  Rule 2033 changes the length by changing
            the end time, which Rule 106 does not prohibit.

CFJ 1550  "When a proposal is aborted, all votes cast on it are canceled."
[FALSE]   4/18     Called by root; part of Linked CFJs 1549-53
Appealed  4/18-21  Assigned to OscarMeyr, who judges FALSE
          4/24-26  Appealed by Maud, Eris, Sherlock, and Goethe
          4/26     Appeal assigned to Murphy, Kolja, and Michael
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 106 (Adopting Proposals) requires
            proper proposals to be voted upon, which may prevent the
            cancellation of all votes.

CFJ 1551  "An aborted proposal necessarily fails."
[FALSE]   4/18     Called by root; part of Linked CFJs 1549-53
          4/18-21  Assigned to OscarMeyr, who judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  If votes are not cancelled (see CFJ
            1550), then Rule 106 (Adopting Proposals) conditions adoption on
            votes, and takes precedence over Rule 2033 (Aborting a Proposal)
            attempting to mandate the proposal's failure.

CFJ 1552  "The Assessor may refuse to publish the votes cast on an aborted
[FALSE]    proposal."
          4/18     Called by root; part of Linked CFJs 1549-53
          4/18-21  Assigned to OscarMeyr, who judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 208 (End of the Voting Period)
            requires publication.  Rule 1064 (Freedom of Information Act)
            requires publication on request, if the Assessor is required to
            record the votes.

CFJ 1553  "The Assessor may refuse to assign a voting index to an aborted
[FALSE]    proposal."
          4/18     Called by root; part of Linked CFJs 1549-53
          4/18-21  Assigned to OscarMeyr, who judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 955 (Votes Required to Adopt a
            Proposal) requires the Assessor to count votes and assign a voting
            index, even if e is not required to publish the votes (see CFJ
            1552).

CFJ 1554  "At least one proposal containing a rule change, that was
[TRUE]     submitted after Rule 1561 was created, has taken effect."
          4/18     Called by Quazie
          4/18-25  Assigned to root, who judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  All proposals bribe at least one
            player by offering something the player considers beneficial.
          Judge's argument (summary):  The rule definition of "bribe" is
            unclear, so game custom, common sense, and the best interests
            of the game all support the rejection of the caller's argument.

CFJ 1555  "Quazie's private Orders to Goethe on or about Sat, 9 Apr 2005
[TRUE]     04:28:32 were improperly executed."
          4/18     Called by Goethe; part of Linked CFJs 1555-7
          4/18-19  Assigned to Manu, who judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  A judgement of TRUE would extend the
            precedent of CFJ 1295 (orders to perform discretionary acts are
            improper) and indicate that such orders conflict with Rule 101
            (Obey the Rules).

CFJ 1556  "Goethe's private Orders to Quazie on or about Mon, 11 Apr 2005
[FALSE]    19:27:50 were improperly executed."
          4/18  Called by Goethe; part of Linked CFJs 1555-7
          4/18-20  Assigned to Manu, who judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  If Quazie's orders are improper (see
            CFJ 1555), then e is required to vacate them, and Goethe's orders
            to perform that required task are proper.
          Judge's argument (summary):  Orders are regulated, thus a proper
            subject for a Private Order.

CFJ 1557  "Quazie's private Orders to Goethe on or about Mon, 11 Apr 2005
[FALSE]    22:41:06 were improperly executed."
          4/18     Called by Goethe; part of Linked CFJs 1555-7
          4/18-20  Assigned to Manu, who judges FALSE
          4/20  Appealed by root
          Caller's argument (summary):  If Goethe's orders are proper (see
            CFJ 1556), then Quazie's orders to vacate them are improper.
          Judge's argument (summary):  Orders are regulated, thus a proper
            subject for a Private Order.

CFJ 1558  "When gazebo_dude deregistered, Thieves in the Night was returned
[TRUE]     to the deck"
          4/18     Called by Quazie
          4/18-24  Assigned to Maud, who judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  gazebo_dude's copy of Thieves in the
            Night was created in eir possession (it was Grafty) and stayed
            there until e deregistered.  Can it "return" somewhere it had
            never been?
          Judge's argument (summary):  "Return" is a gloss for "transfer";
            "the card was previously possessed by the deck" is an implicit
            assumption, not a requirement.  Copies of the same card type are
            fungible, so it is impossible that some copies of Thieves in the
            Night are returnable while others are not.

CFJ 1559  "Quazie successfully played Library Renewal on April 21st"
[FALSE]   4/23     Called by Quazie
          4/23-27  Assigned to Manu, who judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Library Renewal's Exploit is of the
            form "Upon playing this card you may do <action>", as opposed to
            the more straightforward "Do <action>".
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Library Renewal's Exploit fails to
            specify an action that is performed to play the card - it only
            specifies an action that may be performed after playing the card -
            so it is unplayable.

CFJ 1560  "The Justiciar's report was not ratified in 2003."
          4/27  Called by Sherlock
          4/27  Assigned to OscarMeyr
          Caller's argument (summary):  The Justiciar's report did not exist
            in 2003.  Some of its information was part of the Notary's report
            in 2003, and the weekly Notary's report was ratified then, but the
            monthly Notary's report was not; the Justiciar's report is closer
            to the latter.
