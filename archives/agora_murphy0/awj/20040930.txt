ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

    Complacent Corporation - Proposal 4607 adopted 8/8
  New card - Discard and Draw - Discard X cards in your hand (not
counting
    this one), then draw an equal number of cards.  Fee is X kudos.

    Complacent Corporation - Proposal 4613 adopted 9/9

  Agora-as-a-whole no longer has a number of Kudos.

"Fix Chamber-Changing" by root - Proposal 4599 adopted 7/11
  The procedure for changing the Chamber of a proposal in its voting

Game,
    gains the Boon of Pokerface and the Patent Title of Champion, and
one week
    later all Gamblers discard random cards down to the Minimum Hand
Size and
    the Winner draws up to the Maximum Hand Size.
  If no one has won in six months, any Gambler may announce a Skunk. 
This
    acts as a Win, except that no one gets any bonuses.
  The initial Winning Hands are Three Trios (3 x Distrib-u-Matic, 3 x
    Absolv-o-Matic, 3 x Debate-o-Matic) and Dead Man's Hand (Dud x 7).
  The range of the Maximum Hand Size is expanded from (3 to 10) to (2 to
10).
  The Minimum Hand Size is 2 to (less than the Maximum), initially 2.
  The leading Team gets a Daffodil, and its captain an Admiralty.

CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

Requests for ineligibility:

7/6   Michael (future CFJs)
7/27  Maud (Statements contain the letter "e")
8/19  Kolja (called between August 15 and September 8)
8/23  Kolja (called between August 15 and September 8)
9/24  Sherlock (CFJs 1517 and 1518)

CFJ 1511  "Proposal 4588 is Democratic."
[FALSE]   6/25       Called by Goethe; part of Linked CFJs 1511 - 1513
          6/26-7/10  Assigned to Michael, who is recused
          7/11-25    Assigned to Pakaran, who is recused
          7/25-8/1   Assigned to OscarMeyr, who judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Is a Debate-o-Matic capable of
            changing a proposal's chamber?
          Judge's argument (summary):  No.  The Debate-o-Matic is the
            instrument attempting it, but has insufficient Power. 
Proposal
            4588's chamber was not changed to Democratic.

CFJ 1512  "Proposal 4588 is in its voting period."
[TRUE]    6/25       Called by Goethe; part of Linked CFJs 1511 - 1513
          6/26-7/10  Assigned to Michael, who is recused
          7/11-25    Assigned to Pakaran, who is recused
          7/25-8/1   Assigned to OscarMeyr, who judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  If the Debate-o-Matic changed
the
            chamber of Proposal 4588, then what happened to its voting
            period?  Rule 2021 does not apply, since the chamber was
            changed by a method other than paying the Chamber Fee.
          Judge's argument (summary):  The Debate-o-Matic did not change
            the chamber of Proposal 4588, so Proposal 4588 was
definitely
            not aborted.

CFJ 1513  "Riall holds a Debate-o-matic card."
[TRUE]    6/25       Called by Goethe; part of Linked CFJs 1511 - 1513
          6/26-7/10  Assigned to Michael, who is recused
          7/11-25    Assigned to Pakaran, who is recused
          7/25-8/1   Assigned to OscarMeyr, who judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  If the Debate-o-Matic failed to
            change the chamber of Proposal 4588, then does Riail still
            count as having performed the Exploit, thus discarding it?
          Judge's argument (summary):  It did fail, so (by the precedent
            of CFJ 1510) Riail did not perform the Exploit.

CFJ 1514  "Murphy's Voting Potential is 42."
[FALSE]   7/4      Called by Murphy; part of Linked CFJs 1514 - 1515
          7/5-14   Assigned to Sir Toby, who makes emself ineligible
          7/18-22  Assigned to Elysion, who judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  The fee for increasing Voting
            Potential depends on the Political Charge, but the
definition
            of Political Charge has been repealed.  If it is zero, then
            this statement is true.
          Judge's argument (summary):  Political Charge is undefined. 
Raising
            one's Voting Potential is not a fee-based action, and is
thus
            permitted but impossible.  Neither of Murphy's attempts to
raise
            eir Voting Potential changed eir Honor.

CFJ 1515  "Murphy's Voting Potential is 1."
[FALSE]   7/4      Called by Murphy; part of Linked CFJs 1514 - 1515
          7/5-14   Assigned to Sir Toby, who makes emself ineligible
          7/18-22  Assigned to Elysion, who judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  The fee for increasing Voting
            Potential depends on the Political Charge, but the
definition
            of Political Charge has been repealed.  If it retains its
value
            prior to the repeal, then this statement is true.
          Judge's argument (summary):  Political Charge is undefined. 
Raising
            one's Voting Potential is not a fee-based action, and is
thus
            permitted but impossible.  Neither of Murphy's attempts to
raise
            eir Voting Potential changed eir Honor.

CFJ 1516  "Murphy's honor, immediately before e attempted to increase
eir
[FALSE]    Voting Potential by 41, can not be determined by reasonable
           effort."
          7/6      Called by Goethe
          7/11     Assigned to root
          7/11     root attempts to transfer to Sir Toby
          7/18-19  root transfers to Elysion, with consent
          7/2      Elysion judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Murphy previously attempted to
            increase eir Voting Potential by 1, an action defined as
            having a fee, but the amount of the fee is undefined.
          Judge's argument (summary):  Political Charge is undefined. 
Raising
            one's Voting Potential is not a fee-based action, and is
thus
            permitted but impossible.  Neither of Murphy's attempts to
raise
            eir Voting Potential changed eir Honor.

CFJ 1517  "Claustronomic is not currently an Agoran Contest."
          7/29     Called by Goethe; part of Linked CFJs 1517 - 1518
          7/31-15  Assigned to root, who is recused
          8/1      root attempts to transfer to RedKnight, pending
consent
          8/15-29  Assigned to t, who is recused
          9/5-19   Assigned to Sir Toby, who is recused
          9/19-24  Assigned to Sherlock, who is recused
          9/26     Assigned to Michael
          Caller's argument (summary):  Goethe resigned as
Contestmaster,
            and the Regulations do not specify a replacement.

CFJ 1518  "Elysion was awarded 5 points on or about 29-Jul-04."
          7/29     Called by Goethe; part of Linked CFJs 1517 - 1518
          7/31-15  Assigned to root, who is recused
          8/1      root attempts to transfer to RedKnight, pending
consent
          8/15-29  Assigned to t, who is recused
          9/5-19   Assigned to Sir Toby, who is recused
          9/19-24  Assigned to Sherlock, who is recused
          9/26     Assigned to Michael
          Caller's argument (summary):  Elysion was awarded 5 points in
            Claustronomic, and the Scorekeepor's Budget awards equal
points
            in Agora without requiring Claustronomic to be a Contest.

CFJ 1519  "There is a Contest named Claustronomic, and its Contestmaster
is
[TRUE]     root."
          7/29  Called by root; part of Linked CFJs 1519 - 1520
          7/31-8/15  Assigned to RedKnight, who is recused
          8/15-20    Assigned to Goethe, who judges TRUE
          Commentary:  After Goethe resigned as Contestmaster of the
first
            Claustronomic, root created a new Contest named
Claustronomic.

CFJ 1520  "Reasonable Doubt achieved a Team Win on Thursday, July 29,
2004."
[FALSE]   7/29  Called by root; part of Linked CFJs 1519 - 1520
          7/31-8/15  Assigned to RedKnight, who is recused
          8/15-20    Assigned to Goethe, who judges FALSE
          Commentary:  After Goethe resigned as Contestmaster of the
first
            Claustronomic, root created a new Contest named
Claustronomic,
            and awarded emself 200 points within it.  The Scorekeepor's
            Budget awards equal points in Agora to players who are
awarded
            points in Claustronomic, but does not specify which
instance(s)
            of Claustronomic are involved.
          Judge's argument (summary):  If the Budget item refers to
anything,
            it's the original Claustronomic.

CFJ 1521  "Eris has a beard."
[TRUE]    8/15     Called by Murphy
          8/15-19  Assigned to Eris, who judges TRUE
          Commentary:  This CFJ was called to allow a Notice of Rotation
            without waiting for a non-trivial CFJ.
