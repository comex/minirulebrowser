ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Auction Errors, etc." by Steve - Proposal 4356 adopted 8/7
  An Auction initiated with incorrect information may, Without 2 Objections, be
    deemed correct.
  If an Auction is optional, and does not specify who starts it, then the
    Speaker's starting it is also optional.
  Failing to pay an Auction debt within a week is the Class 2 Infraction of
    Default, reportable by the Auctioneer; the bidder loses eir right to the
    Auctioned item, and the Auction debt is forgiven.  Provisions thus made
    redundant are repealed.  (Fails to amend Rule 1936; insufficient AI.)
  Forgiving a debt relieves part or all of the debtor's obligation to transfer
    Property, but does not otherwise act as if a payment was made.
  Rule 1983 (Vickrey Auctions) loses a redundant "not On Hold" provision, and
    has "Public Forum" changed to "publically".
  Players On Hold may buy Raffle Tickets.

"Change Scoring for Proposers" by Steve - Proposal 4365 adopted 8/23
  The adoption of a Proposal is worth, instead of 2 Points per Vote AGAINST:
    1 Point, plus 1 per Vote AGAINST, plus 3 if the Proposal is Interested.
  New Players get only 0.2 Papyri for the adoption of a Disinterested Proposal.

"Clarify Proposal Distribution" by Steve - Proposal 4355 adopted 8/7
  The Promotor is explicitly:
    Allowed, at any time, to distribute a Distributable Proposal.
    Required, during each week, to distribute all Proposals that were
      Distributable at the beginning of the week (unless they have since
      become Undistributable); or, if there were no such Proposals, to
      announce that fact.
  The Promotor shall announce each Proposal's Adoption Index (but the
    distribution counts, even if e fails to do so).
  The effect of Aborting a Proposal is moved to a separate Rule.
  Rule 2021 (Chamber Procedure) is slightly re-worded for clarity.

"Eligibility Fix" by Steve - Proposal 4343 adopted 7/11
  A CFJ may be transferred to a Judge who is ineligible solely due to Rule
    1871 (Turns for All), and the transferring Judge becomes eligible for the
    purpose of that Rule.

"Fix Canceling Bids in Vickrey Auctions" by Sir Toby - Proposal 4358 adopted
    8/16 (fails to take effect; text to be replaced is no longer there)

  Only the Prime Executor with respect to satisfying the debt is penalized for
    Persistent Indebtedness.

"Fix Property Protection" by root - Proposal 4340 adopted 7/8
  Increase the Power of "Property Protection" to 2.  (It was created with
    "Adoption Index of 2", which does nothing useful for Rules.)

"Fix Robespierre - Take 2" by Sir Toby - Proposal 4339 adopted 7/8
  Fix a typo in Rule 1923 ("it the Revolt" should be "if the Revolt").

"Fix Rule 2027" by RedKnight - Proposal 4354 adopted 8/7

"Fix Rule 594" by root - Proposal 4349 adopted 7/20

    (Power and Proposals).

"Fix VE Distribution" by Steve - Proposal 4359 adopted 8/16

"Hail Agora!" by RedKnight - Contested Proposal 4362 adopted 8/16

"NPA Fix" by Goethe - Proposal 4344 adopted 7/11

  Parliamentary Proposals receive one Vote from each of the three Estates:
    Acolytes, Politicians, and Scribes.
  Player Votes are counted according to what would have been legal if the
    Proposal had been Sane.

"Permitting Pay-Outs" by Steve - Proposal 4351 Sanitised and aborted 7/22,
    Notice of Complacency posted anyway 8/1 - Proposal 4353 (Sane) adopted 8/7
    - Proposal 4364 (Democratic) adopted 8/16

    vote on that Issue is completely without effect.

    changed.  However, errors in the report may be corrected.

"Really, No Double Jeopardy" by Steve - Proposal 4341 adopted 7/8
  No Player may be penalized more than once for any action or inaction that
    violates one or more Rules.

"Repeal Monkhood" by OscarMeyr
  Repeal the concept of Monks.

"Repeal Opposite Proposals" by Steve
  Repeal Rule 1991 (Opposite Proposals).

"Refined Movement" by Sir Toby
  Instead of spending 10 Movement Units to change the Land Type of an adjacent
    Unit to a random non-Aether Type, a Player may spend 10 Movement Units to
    change the Land Type of any non-Aether Unit to an alternating Type.  The
    alternating Type cycles through all non-Aether Types defined by the Rules,
    starting with the first one.

"Thesis Archives" by OscarMeyr
  The Rulekeepor shall retain copy of each approved Thesis (including those
    pre-dating the invention of the Thesis Committee).

"This Time For Sure..." by Steve
  Rule 1936 (Auctioning Positions in the Oligarchy) loses a now-redundant
    clause about failing to pay Auction debts ASAP.
  The GWotO is no longer required to forgive defaulted Oligarchy Upkeep debts

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

<no title> by Goethe
  The CotC (or Justiciar) may dismiss a Frivolous CFJ; the Caller is billed a
    judicial salary for Annoying the Court.
  The Caller may re-submit the CFJ with 2 Supporters; the CFJ cannot be
    re-dismissed as Frivolous, and the bill is forgiven.
  The Caller may hire a Sharp Lawyer (costing twoce the penalty amount) to
    submit a CFJ that cannot be dismissed as Frivolous.

<no title> by Goethe
  Submitting a Proposal or CFJ requires at least 1 Supporter.

"Accusation and Sentencing Reform" by harvel
  Sentencing Orders are a separate class of Order.
  All offences (Crimes and Infractions) are reported via Notice of Accusation.
  Rule 1814 (Timing of Penalties for Crimes and Infractions) is merged into
    Rule 1503 (Crimes and Infractions).
  Sentencing Orders shall be restricted to what is necessary (as well as
    sufficient) to impose the penalty.
  A Notice of Accusation for a Crime is presumptively invalid, and must be
    proven true via CFJ.  All other Notices of Accusation are presumptively
    valid.
  Rules 1812 (Notices of Infraction) and 1816 (No Double Jeopardy for Crimes)
    are merged into Rule 1504 (Sentencing Orders, renamed "Notices of
    Accusation").

"Alternative Weather Determination" by Sir Toby
  Weather probabilities are as follows:
    FOUL   = Bank Stems * 2
    PLENTY = non-Bank Stems
    SAME   = (FOUL+PLENTY) / 4
    FAIR   = (FOUL+PLENTY) / 4

"Blame Canada" by Murphy
  Agora recognizes the FRC, Canada, and the Monster Raving Loony Party, and the
    Speaker shall try to get them to recognize Agora.

"Criminal Reform" by Murphy
  ASAP is changed from a cascading requirement to a straight definition.
  Rule 1553 (Officer Transition) loses the text "violates this Rule", since it
    already defines a Crime.
  Rules 1724 (Urgent Proposals), 1770 (Distributing Proposals), and 1827
    (Granting or Denying Motions) lose the concept "detect and report", which
    has elsewhere been shortened to "report".
  Sentencing Orders penalize Crimes; Ticketing Orders penalize Infractions;
    they shall be necessary and sufficient to apply the penalty.
  A Formal Apology may substitute for the Sentencing Orders of any Crime.
  Players are encouraged to CFJ on Infractions only when a question of
    interpretation, rather than fact, arises.
  If a Sentencing or Ticketing Order for Blots is recorded and then vacated,
    then the Blots are expunged.
  Violating a Rule (in the absence of any other penalty) is the Class N Crime
    of Disobedience.  N is the Power of the violated Rule, but at most 4.
  Violating a SLC (unless necessary to avoid violating the Rules or another SLC
    with precedence) is the Class 1 Crime of Insubordination.
  Violating a SLC may only be CFJed by a Player within its Jurisdiction, and
    may only be Judged by a Player outside its Jurisdiction.

"Cyclical All-Currency Resets" by Steve
  When a Bank Currency is reset:
    Holdings are destroyed.
    Debts and rights to have it returned are cancelled.

  One day before November, Indulgences are reset.

"Fix Birthday Gifts" by Murphy
  Birthday Stems are not required to be transferred by the Payroll Clerk (which
    e is not empowered to do), but required to be paid out by the (Registrar /
    Speaker).

"Fix Canceling Bids in Vickrey Auctions - Take 2" by Sir Toby
  In a Vickrey Auction, Players who must Bid in public must also cancel eir
    Bids in public.

"Fix selection of the Thesis Committee" by OscarMeyr
  The second member of a Thesis Committee is (not yet determined):
    An Oligarch?
    Based on Score?
    Based on date of registration?
    Order of Succession?
    Based on Currency holdings?
    Current Champion?

"In defense of natural language" by Murphy
  Rule 1431 (Claims of Error) is re-worded for clarity.

"The CotC's Payment" by Steve
  The Treasuror's Budget includes the CotC's Payment (0 to 10 Stems, initially
    5).  This is the Fee to call a CFJ.  The Bank owes this Fee to the CotC (or
    Justiciar) once e publishes the CFJ and assigns its first Judge.

CFJ 832  "Rule 1079 shall be interpreted such that the Dice-roll email server
[TRUE]    at dice@danpost4.uni-c.dk meets its requirements for randomness"
         11/10/95  Called by Vanyel
         11/13     Assigned to Andre, who defaults
         11/22-29  Assigned to Ian, who defaults
         12/1      Assigned to Michael, who Judges TRUE
         Caller's argument (summary):  The server is pseudorandom, but close
           enough to random, and no Player can control it to produce false
           randomness.
         Commentary:  See CFJ 1406.

CFJs 945-1044 "This statement is TRUE." (identical Statements)
              Commentary:  See CFJ 1401.

CFJ 1394 "This CFJ's judge is the Goddess Eris."
[FALSE]  7/5    Called by Craig
         7/5    Assigned to root, who Judges FALSE
         7/6-7  Appealed by Murphy, Craig, and Sir Toby
         7/7-9  Appeal assigned to OscarMeyr, Eris, and Steve, who unanimously
                  move to SUSTAIN
         Steve's argument (summary):  Rule 451 says that Judgement depends on
           the Statement's truth at the time it was Called, so Goddess Eris
           being an Appelate Judge is irrelevant.

CFJ 1395 "This is not a CFJ."
[FALSE]  7/5    Called by Craig
         7/5-7  Assigned to Sir Toby, who Judges FALSE

CFJ 1397 "A Provision of an adopted Proposal that does not change the Ruleset

         7/7-14  Assigned to OscarMeyr, who Judges TRUE
         Caller's argument (summary):  This tests the application of Rule 594.
         Judge's commentary (summary):  The Rules for casting and changing
           Votes do not rule out other methods.

CFJ 1398 "A Provision of an adopted Proposal that does not change the Ruleset
[TRUE]    may create a Stem in any Player's possession by its adoption."
         7/1     Called by Goethe - Linked to CFJs 1397 and 1399

         Caller's argument (summary):  This tests the application of Rule 594.
         Judge's commentary (summary):  The Rules for creating Currency do not
           rule out other methods.

CFJ 1399 "A Provision of an adopted Proposal that does not change the Ruleset
[TRUE]    may destroy a Stem in any Player's possession by its adoption."
         7/1     Called by Goethe - Linked to CFJs 1397 and 1398
         7/7-14  Assigned to OscarMeyr, who Judges TRUE
         Caller's argument (summary):  This tests the application of Rule 594.
         Judge's commentary (summary):  The Rules for destroying Currency do
           not rule out other methods.

CFJ 1400 "Only the Treasuror is empowered to forgive debts to the Bank
[FALSE]   denominated in Bank Currencies."
         7/8     Called by Steve
         7/9-11  Assigned to root
         Caller's argument (summary):  Limited Executors of the Bank are
           empowered to satisfy debts, but not to forgive them.
         Judge's refutation (summary):  An adopted Proposal may forgive them.

CFJ 1401 "No frivolous CFJs have been made by a non-Player."

CFJ 1406 "Pseudorandom numbers do not qualify as Random under the rules of
[FALSE]   Agora."
         7/14     Called by Craig
         7/15-16  Assigned to OscarMeyr, who proto-Judges FALSE
         8/5      OscarMeyr recused
         8/5      Incorrectly assigned to harvel, who is On Hold
         8/5-6    Assigned to root, who makes emself ineligible
         8/9      Assigned to Murphy, who Judges FALSE
         Caller's argument (summary):  Pseudorandom numbers are deterministic
           and predictable, thus not reasonably close to random.
         Judge's refutation (summary):  Some pseudorandom numbers are generated
           by methods which no Player could predict.

CFJ 1407 "The Registrar has not fulfilled eir duty under Rule 478/12 in eir
[TRUE]    last report."
         7/14     Called by RedKnight
         7/15-17  Assigned to Craig, who Judges TRUE and Orders Murphy to
                    submit a Formal Apology
         Caller's argument (summary):  The Registrar has not provided enough
           information to subscribe to the backup lists, which are Public Fora.

CFJ 1408 "Rulekeepor Michael has committed the Class 2 Crime of Unlawful 
[TRUE]    Nondisclosure, as defined by Rule 1064/9."
         8/4     Called by RedKnight
         8/9-15  Assigned to Sir Toby, who Judges TRUE
         8/24    Appealed by Murphy and root
         Caller's argument (summary):  Michael made no response to RedKnight's
           request for a copy of all theses approved for degrees.
         Counterargument:  Michael is not required to keep copies of all theses
           approved (only those approved by Committee), so e was not required
           to respond to RedKnight's request.

CFJ 1409 "Sir Toby's COE in
          http://www.escribe.com/games/agora-business/m7478.html was not a
          valid Claim of Error."
         8/12  Called by OscarMeyr
         8/16  Assigned to Craig
         Caller's argument (summary):  Sir Toby's message attempts to be a COE
           on a COE.  The normal way to handle a COE is to Respond, then CFJ if
           needed.
         Commentary:  The original COE may be parsed as either "the Gamestate
           is X" (may be true) or "I claim that the Gamestate is X" (trivially
           true).  In either case, it can be COEd, but probably shouldn't be.

CFJ 1410 "The Order executed by RedKnight in the message archived at
[FALSE]   http://www.escribe.com/games/agora-business/m7451.html was improperly
          or invalidly executed."
         8/12  Called by root
         8/16  Assigned to Steve, who Judges FALSE
         Caller's argument (summary):  The Notice of Infraction announces two
           Infractions, but Orders the penalty for only one of em.  Rule 1812
           (e) requires a valid Notice of Infraction to contain "Whatever
           Orders are sufficient to impose the penalty for the Infraction".
         Judge's refutation (summary):  The rest of the Notice of Infraction
           makes it clear that RedKnight was reporting only one Infraction.

CFJ 1411 "OscarMeyr is Michael's Opposite on RedKnight's Thesis Committee."
         8/22  Called by Steve
         Caller's argument (summary):  Votes cast during the Quarter in
           question, and opposite to Michael's Votes on the same Proposals,
           were cast on Proposals 4281 through 4342.  Steve cast the largest
           number of such opposite Votes, but OscarMeyr cast opposite Votes on
           the largest number of Proposals.
