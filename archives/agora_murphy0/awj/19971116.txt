     THE AGORAN WEEKLY JOURNAL
     VOLUME 42, ISSUE 7
     Sunday edition

Once again the formatting is changed up somewhat.  Any recommendations on
that topic?  (Old Journals are available for comparison, if you like.)


PROPOSALS
---------

11/09  Oerjan and General Chaos suggest a Declaration of Absence,
         identical to a Declaration of Presence except the declarer
         doesn't count toward Quorum.  This would distinguish between
         those who haven't reacted at all to a Proposal, and those
         whose reaction is to detract from Quorum but not bother to
         spend a VT to Vote AGAINST.

       General Chaos protoes the following:
         * No Crime is committed if the Player believed e was innocent
             at the time of action, or was unaware of action being
             required at the time of inaction.
         * Election results must be challenged within seven days.
         * Rule 1599's requirement to re-execute Payment Orders that
             have been executed-and-then-vacated should not apply to
             Payment Orders vacated by requirement of a Rule.
         * Nonrequired Currency transfers to Bank are transferred back
             unless labelled a donation.
         * Split Rule 721 (Vizier/Group Voting) into conceptual halves.
         * A Currency Recordkeepor may only report Infraction of
             Persistent Indebtedness regarding the Currency of which
             e is Recordkeepor.
         * Allow Groups to have SLCs other than Ordinances associated
             with them (to prevent such SLCs from inadvertently
             replacing Ordinances).
         * Transfer Orders may satisfy at most one Payment Order.

11/10  Proposal 3597 [Andre] Blot Amnesty Extension
         All Fugitive Blots are destroyed.

       Proposal 3598 [Morendil] Finish Amnesty

         Prevent Group Wills from inadvertently replacing Ordinances.

       Proposal 3600 [Swann] More Interesting Proposal Mechanisms
         Non-Proposing Entities may submit Proposals via their
         Executor.

       Kolja A. protoes explicitly allowing the Ambassador to accept or
         reject a Player's second and subsequent Internomic Proposals
         in a given week.

       Kolja A. suggests copying Rule 754 (spelling/grammar errors are
         without effect if meaning is unambiguous) to Internomic.

       Internomic Proposal 349 [Agora] adopted
         Proposal quoted below:

         string "New Rishonnomic"

       Internomic Proposal 350 [Agora - Swann] Agora will vote FOR it
         Defines formal protests and sanctions

       Swann protoes Power of Attorney, allowing Players to name other
         Players as eir temporary Executor (if the Grantor has been
         registered for long enough).

       Internomic Proposal 351 [Agora - Kolja A.] submitted
         Proposal quoted below:
         Fix a typo in rule 349 by replacing the string "The liaison of
         any member nomic can sent a message to the mailing list" with
         "The liaison of any member nomic can send a message to the
         mailing list".

11/11  General Chaos submits revised protoes for 
         * Election results must be challenged within seven days.
         * Currency transfers to Bank are transferred back unless a
             purposes is stated and successfully achieved.
       and protoes the following:
         * No double penalties in Rule 1007 (Failure to Report).
         * If the Bank has negative Indulgences, no Indulgence
             Transfers occur per Rule 1712.

11/12  Steve protoes allowing the Assessor to reveal Votes that have
         already been posted to the Public Forum anyway.

11/13  Crito re-protoes Style Changes, eliminating the quarterly Style
         reset and limiting the P-Note reward for Style to the times
         when one's previous highest Style is exceeded.

       Steve Proposes the following:
         "Be it hereby resolved that Waggie, Gecko, Kelly, Swann,
          KoJen, Zefram and Vlad be awarded the Patent Title of Left In

                        Crimes and Infractions are suspended]

OFFICES
-------

11/11  Elections close.

       These Offices had no Nominees, and are still held temporarily,
       and new Elections begin:

       Archivist             Vanyel (temporarily; no Nominees)
       Cartographor          Morendil (temporarily; no Nominees)

       These Offices had one Nominee each, and are filled by
       Acclamation:

       Ambassador            Kolja A.
       Assessor              General Chaos
       Chancellor            General Chaos
       Clerk of the Courts   elJefe
       Commander-in-Chief    Vlad
       Herald                Crito
       Notary                Murphy
       Registrar             Michael
       Rulekeepor            Chuck
       Wizard                General Chaos

       These Offices were contested, and Voting begins:

       Justiciar             Swann, General Chaos, Crito
       Mad Scientist         Swann, Oerjan
       Promotor              Crito, Swann
       Speaker-Elect         Steve, General Chaos, Michael, Morendil

       Morendil Nominates for Archivist and Cartographor.

       elJefe resigns as Justiciar, appointing Steve in eir place.

       General Chaos attempts to withdraw from the Speaker-Elect
         Election.

11/13  Vlad appoints Swann as Clerk of the Courts (this is presumably
         implicit resignation), donates all eir possessions to
         Morendil, and deregisters.


OTHER NEWS
----------

11/10  Harlequin comes Off Hold.
       Harlequin (on behalf of Morendil) attempts to register Morendil
         as a Player.  This is unsuccessful, either because Morendil
         is already registered (see CFJ 1070) or because Morendil's
         deregistration for Lawlessness prevents eir registration.
       Harlequin goes On Hold.

11/11  Vlad becomes a Boor for Proposal 3589.
       Morendil becomes a Boor for Proposal 3598.

       Champion's Rewards end for Steve, Andre, and Morendil.

       ChrisM deregisters due to lack of time.

       Rule 908 (Formal Apologies) is Infected by the Virus.

11/12  Kolja A. attempts to (on behalf of Elde) register Elde.  This is
         successful only if Kolja A. is Elde's Executor in Probate;
         this reviewer believes that, in fact, Elde's EiP is Morendil.

       Vir attempts to wheedle a couple of VTs out of a possible
         loophole in Rule 1717 - incorrectly referring to Proposal
         3591 in the process, but correcting the error the next day
         (as well as unsuccessfully attempting to come Off Hold).

11/15  Steve unsuccessfully attempts to terminate Probate for Swann.

       Oerjan pays a VT to each of Calabresi, Chuck, Michael, Vanyel,
         and elJefe for Voting FOR Proposal 3581 twice.  (Also one to
         Vir for trying hard; and one is promised to Vlad if e
         re-registers.)

11/16  Andre goes On Hold.
