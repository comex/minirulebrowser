"Role With the Changes" by Sherlock - Proposal 4561 adopted 3/21
  New Roles of Patron and Shamus are created.
  Snitching is a progressive action for Shamuses.  The Shamus must
report
    an unreported Crime or Infraction that the target has committed; e
takes
    one Kudo from the target, but the target is immune to further
penalty.
  Donating is a progressive action for Patrons.  The target Team gains 3
    points.

"Vox Populi" by Elysion - Proposal 4555 adopted 3/21
  Each player has an associated coalition, possibly empty.
  Each player belongs to at most one coalition.
  Players join or leave coalitions by announcement.
  Each player has a Lobbying Strength, default 1.  A player may increase
eir
    Lobbying Strength for (Political Charge) Kudos per unit, halved for
    Politicians.  Lobbying Strengths reset at the beginning of the
month.
  A player's Potency is the sum of the Lobbying Strengths of all members
of
    eir coalition.
  Membership in the Oligarchy becomes a switch (Class: Plebeian,
Oligarch).
  A Plebeian whose Potency is at least the Potency Threshold may become
an
    Oligarch.  An Oligarch whose Potency goes below the Potency
Threshold for
    at least five days may be removed by the Grand Warden of the
Oligarchy.
  The Grand Warden of the Oligarchy's Budget includes the Political
Charge and
    Potency Threshold, both integers less than 10.
  The initial Potency Threshold is 6.  The initial Political Charge is
equal
    to the previous Oligarchy Charge Requirement.

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

"Mare Inanium" by Goethe - Contested Proposal 4552

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Move Or" by Maud - Proposal 4568
  Correct a grammatical error in Rule 1963 due to a previous broken
amendment.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Another Team Award" by Goethe
  Winning team members have their Lobbying Strength increased by the
Potency
    Threshold.

"Boon Auctions" by Murphy
  The Default Auction Procedure is re-enacted and tied to kudos.
  Each month, the Herald shall auction five lots of five Daffodils each.

"Cards" by Wes
  The Deckmastor tracks Cards and their ownership.
  The Deckmastor's Budget contains the Maximum Hand Size (an integer
from 3
    to 10).
  The Deckmastor is Executor of the Deck, but may only cause it to act
as
    specified by the rules.  The Deck may not transfer cards unless
required.
  When required by the rules, the Deckmastor shall create or destroy
Cards
    by announcing the Card and its owner.
  Players and other rule-specified entities may own Cards.  Unowned
Cards are
    automatically transferred to the Deck.
  An entity's Hand is the set of eir Cards, and eir Hand Size is the
number
    of Cards in eir Hand.
  Each class of Card has a Caption (name), a Quota, zero or more
Elements, and
    zero or more Exploits.  Cards of the same class are fungible.
  Each class of Card should have exactly (Quota) instances.  If not,
Cards are
    created or destroyed as needed.  (The Deck's Cards are destroyed
first,
    followed by randomly selected instances.)
  Each Element has a rule-defined name and description.  All cards with
an
    Element behave according to its description.
  An Exploit is an action that the holder can take, after which the card
    returns to the Deck (unless a rule says otherwise).  "Playing a
card"
    means using one of its Exploits.
  Cards may be transferred by announcement.
  "Discarding a card" means transferring it to the Deck.
  "Drawing a card" means drawing it from the Deck.
  An entity may draw a card (for a Fee equal to the number of times e
has
    previously done so this month) if it is permitted to hold Cards, and
if
    eir Hand Size (including pending draws that the Deckmastor has not
yet
    processed) would not exceed the Maximum Hand Size.  The Deckmastor
shall
    randomly select one of the Deck's cards for each draw.
  Elements:
    * Budgeted (Quota is part of Deckmastor's Budget)
    * Handed X (counts as X cards toward Hand Size)
    * Restricted X (only entities of type X may use Exploits)
    * Limited X Y (entities not of type X must pay a Fee of Y to use
Exploits)
    * Persistant (not returned to Deck after it is used)
    * Bleed X (holder loses X points per week)

"Filibustering" by Elysion
  Ordinary Proposals may have an Adoption Index of 2 or greater, but are
    then Stalled and cannot be distributed (until it is Debated, thus
    changing its Chamber).

"Fix Nominating with Budgets" by Murphy
  The announcement and effectiveness of proto-budgets are tied to the
    nominating period and the end of the election, not the voting period
    (since some elections don't have one).  All such elections in the
past
    are retroactively adjusted so that proto-budgets took effect as
intended.

"Fix Team Wins" by Murphy
  After a win, player and team scores are reset pragmatically (upon the
    Scorekeepor's announcement) rather than platonically (upon the win
itself).
  If multiple teams reach the Team Points Goal before a win is
announced,
    only the first team to reach the Goal wins.

"Judicial Separation" by Murphy
  Restrictions on being more than one of (Speaker, Clerk of the Courts,
    Justiciar) are collected in one Rule.
  The Speaker and Clerk of the Courts can nominate others for Justiciar,
but
    cannot be nominated for Justiciar.  (Previous language is left over
from
    the old Office rules, when all nominations were Selfish.)
  The Justiciar cannot be nominated for Clerk of the Courts.
  The Clerk of the Courts and Justiciar can be nominated for
Speaker-Elect.
  A player nominated for one of (Clerk of the Courts, Justiciar) cannot
be
    nominated for the other.

"Judicial Tweaks" by Murphy
  Replacement Appellate Judges need not be chosen randomly.
  If a Trial Judge is recused from one or more Linked CFJs, then they
are
    unlinked from all other CFJs (but remain linked to each other, if
multiple
    recusals appear in a single message).
  Good-faith errors in judge selection no longer stand if the Clerk of
the
    Courts revises the selection before the incorrect judge returns
judgement.
  Unready players are ineligible to judge any CFJ.
  Quiet and silent players are ineligible to become a judge (but remain
    eligible to judge any CFJs to which they are already assigned).

"Lobbying Strength" by Wes
  Lobbying Strengths decrease by 1 each month, instead of resetting to
1.

"Replacing Roles with Cards" by Wes
  Classes of Cards:
    * Distrib-u-Matic (Budgeted; make a proposal distributable)
    * Absolv-o-Matic (Budgeted; Limited Immaculate 1; expunge a blot
from
        any entity)
    * Debate-o-Matic (Budgeted; flip the chamber of a non-Sane proposal)
    * Boost-o-Matic (Budgeted; increase a team's points by 5; increase a
        team's points by 10 for a Fee of 1)

"Some More Cards" by Wes
  Classes of Cards:
    * ZOT! (Quota 1; Handed 3; reduce an entity's points by X*10 points
for a
        fee of X; cannot make an entity's points negative)
    * Oligarch of the Day (Quota 1; Restricted Senators; Oligarch for
rest of
        day)
    * Albatross Flies Away (Quota 1; Limited Immaculate 3; revoke one of
your
        Albatrosses)

"Sweeping it under the rug, take two" by Murphy
  The gamestate becomes what it would have been if Steve's Voting Power
on
    Democratic Proposals were 2 through October and November 2003. 
(Proposals
    4532, 4533, 4534, 4540, and 4542 would have properly been adopted,
    regardless of what combination of Steve's attempted votes were valid
or
    invalid, but they have not taken effect because the Assessor
mis-reported
    Steve's pairs-of-votes as valid.)

"Team Shuffling" by Murphy
  After a win, team scores are divided evenly among the members, all
players
    are removed from teams, then each player (from highest to lowest
score) is
    assigned to the team with the lowest combined player score so far.

"The Enemies of Agora" by Sherlock
  Players may create Threats by announcing its Name, Nature, Power, and
    Target, and paying a fee equal to its Power.
  Each Threat goes through a one-week Incubation Period.  If not
Thwarted, it
    is Hatched.
  If a Beast Hatches, the target Team loses (Power) points per member.
  If a Disaster Hatches, its creator has seven days to propose the
repeal of
    the target rule, and is deemed to cast (Power) extra FOR votes on
it.
  If a Villain Hatches, the target Player loses (Power + 1) kudos.
  A player may Thwart a Threat by paying (Power + 1) kudos, or (Power /
2)
    kudos with the support of one-third of active players, or with the
support
    of all active members of a Team to which they do not belong.  The
player
    receives (Power / 2, rounded up) kudos.
  Threats are tracked by the Notary.

"Wacky Cards" by Wes
  Classes of Cards:
    * Point Mine (Quota 1; Persistant; gain 1 point per week)
    * Dud (Quota 5? Budgeted? Persistant; does nothing)
    * Dud Fusion (Quota? Bleed 2; discard X Duds to gain X*20 points)
    * Player Stasis (Quota 1; a player of your choice can't play cards
for
        88 hours)
    * Hot Potato (Quota 1; Persistant; transfer to another entity, if
they
        don't announce "Hot Potato" within 48 hours then you can ding
them
        for the Class 1 Infraction of Dropping the Potato)
    * It's a Surprise! (Quota 1; Handed 2; draw two cards for free)

CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT

*** Rule 1567 causes ineligibility by request to expire after one month
***

2/3   Kolja makes emself ineligible to judge CFJs unless the assignment
is
        cc:ed to koljag@yahoo.com

4/5   Maud makes emself ineligible to judge CFJs

4/8   RedKnight makes emself ineligible to judge appeals of CFJ 1497

CFJ 1481  "A Player's score is deemed to change at the time a
Scorekeepor
[TRUE]     is notified of a scoring event, not at the time of the
scoring
           event itself."
          1/30     Called by Goethe
          2/1-14   Assigned to t, who defaults
          2/14-22  Assigned to Blob, who defaults
          3/19-27  Assigned to root, who judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Scoring events "cause" score
changes,
            but the changes are not recorded unless the Scorekeepor is
            notified.
          Judge's argument (summary):  If the scoring event in a
notification
            did not actually occur, then Rule 1929 makes the
notification
            valid anyway if it is not challenged within 7 days.  This
becomes
            broken if the timing of score changes is based on the
scoring
            event itself, rather than the notification.

CFJ 1482  "Kolja and Kolja A are not eligible for any responsibilities
as
DISMISS    described under R1755 until the following linked CFJ is
           resoloved."
          2/10     Called by Cainech
          2/14-19  Assigned to Goethe, who judges DISMISS
          Judge's commentary (summary):  At the time this CFJ was
called,
            the outcome of CFJ 1483 was unknown, and thus the truth of
the
            statement could not be determined.

CFJ 1483  "when referring to Kolja in public forum, it is ambiguous as
to
[FALSE]    whether Klaus or Kolja A is referred to, thereby entailing an
           infraction of R754."
          2/10     Called by Cainech; linked to CFJs 1484 - 1487
          2/14-15  Assigned to Sir Toby, who makes emself ineligible
          2/15-20  Assigned to OscarMeyr, who judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  "Kolja A." never deregistered. 
"Klaus"
            recently registered, and eir previous request to be listed
as a
            Watcher did not deregister anyone.
          Commentary:  According to the Registrar's Report, "Kolja A."
            deregistered in 1999.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  When Kolja registered, e stated
that
            e was previously registered as Kolja A. and that eir real
name was
            Klaus.  There is no evidence to the contrary.  "Klaus",
"Kolja",
            and "Kolja A." unambiguously refer to the same player.

CFJ 1484  "OscarMeyer issued an invalid order by requesting that 'Klaus'
be
[TRUE]     globally changed to 'Kolja'."
          2/10     Called by Cainech; linked to CFJs 1483 and 1485 -
1487
          2/14-15  Assigned to Sir Toby, who makes emself ineligible
          2/15-20  Assigned to OscarMeyr, who judges TRUE
          Judge's argument (summary):  OscarMeyr's order was based on
the
            acceptance of a COE, but the acceptance did not state what
report
            e was correcting, nor did it include a correction of the
relevant
            portions of that report.

CFJ 1485  "'Kolja' is not entitled to the benefits assosciated with
being a
[FALSE]    completely new player, as the player has been registered
under a
           different name in the past 365 days."
          2/10     Called by Cainech; linked to CFJs 1483 - 1484 and
                     1486 - 1487
          2/14-15  Assigned to Sir Toby, who makes emself ineligible
          2/15-20  Assigned to OscarMeyr, who judges FALSE
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Kolja was previously registered
as
            Kolja A., but last deregistered in 1999.

CFJ 1486  "All references in public forum to 'Kolja' should refer to the
DISMISS    original bearer of that name, Kolja A.  This should be
           applicable retroactively."
          2/10     Called by Cainech; linked to CFJs 1483 - 1485 and
1487
          2/14-15  Assigned to Sir Toby, who makes emself ineligible
          2/15-19  Assigned to OscarMeyr, who judges DISMISS
          Judge's commentary (summary):  Statements of what "should" be
            are irrelevant to the rules.

CFJ 1487  "A Watcher is still an active Player."
DISMISS   2/10     Called by Cainech; linked to CFJs 1483 - 1486
          2/14-15  Assigned to Sir Toby, who makes emself ineligible
          2/15-19  Assigned to OscarMeyr, who judges DISMISS
          Judge's commentary (summary):  The statement has no single
truth
            value unless it is applied to a particular Watcher.

CFJ 1488  "Bringing about a situation other than one explicitily allowed
in
[FALSE]    the rules in which other Players are unable to follow rule n
is,
           in and of itself, breaking rule n."
          2/11     Called by Cainech
          2/14-20  Assigned to Sherlock, who judges FALSE
          Judge's refutation (summary):  No rule prohibits or regulates
such
            bringing about, so Rule 101 permits it.

CFJ 1489  "Watchers are not a rule-defined elemeent of the game."
[TRUE]    2/11     Called by Cainech
          2/14-22  Assigned to Peekee, who defaults
          3/19-28  Assigned to Maud, who judges TRUE

CFJ 1490  "Cainech's statement of 11 Feb 2004 14:10:04, reading 'I lay a
[FALSE]    COE on OscarMeyerfor accepting a COE that was not made in a
           public forum, thereby contraveningR1431. ("A Claim of Error
is a
           public message.....")' is NOT a valid COE."
          2/11     Called by OscarMeyr
          2/14-17  Assigned to Cainech, who judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Cainech's statement does not
claim
            that OscarMeyr misrepresented the game state, only that e
            accepted an informal non-public correction.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Cainech's COE alleged that
Registrar
            OscarMeyr acted outside eir authority, and is thus permitted
by
            Rule 1665 (Abuse of Responsibility) which takes precedence
over
            Rule 1431.

CFJ 1491  "CFJ's 1482 to 1487 are not valid CFJ's, as the text was never
[FALSE]    submitted to the CotC."
          2/15     Called by Cainech
          2/15-22  Assigned to Pakaran, who defaults
          3/19     Assigned to Goethe, who judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  The text was not sent publically
or
            directly, but only via agora-discussion.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  The statements were clearly
labelled
            as CFJs, and the CotC clearly received them.

CFJ 1492  "Cainech, not root, is the Trial Judge of CFJ 1490."
[TRUE]    2/17     Called by root
          2/17-29  Assigned to Michael, who judges FALSE
          2/29     Appealed by root, Michael, and Sir Toby
          2/29     Appeal assigned to Sherlock, RedKnight, and Peekee
          3/4      root moves to REASSIGN
          3/5      Sherlock moves to REMAND
          3/14     Peekee defaults
          3/14     Appeal assigned to Maud, who moves to REMAND
          3/14-19  Remanded to Michael, who judges TRUE
          Judge's argument (summary):  The CotC's records say that root
is
            the Trial Judge.
          Appelant root's counterargument (summary):  The CotC's records
are
            incorrect.  Rule 2032 (Errors in Judge Selection) cause the
            otherwise-invalid assignment of Cainech to be valid.

CFJ 1493  "The position of Speaker defined in the regulations of the
[TRUE]     Contest 'Claustronomic' is currently filled by Goethe."
          3/23      Called by Kolja
          3/30-4/6  Assigned to RedKnight, who judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Claustronomic does not define
how
            people become [C]players or [C]Speaker.  However, Goethe was
            named in the [A]Application to Create an Organization, so e
            implicitly became a [C]player, and hence [C]Speaker
(Claustronomic
            states that there is always exactly one [C]Speaker).
          Commentary:  While Goethe was the only [A]member, e informed
emself
            that e was [C]Speaker.  [C]Rule 101 permits whatever is not
            prohibited or regulated.  [A]Rule 1528 permits [A]properties
to be
            changed by unanimous agreement of all [A]members.  The
statement
            "Goethe has been speaker of Claustronomic since the Agora
contest
            defining Claustronomic has been created" was [C]judged true.

CFJ 1494  "Eris is immaculate."
[TRUE]    4/1    Called by Eris
          4/1-2  Assigned to root, who judges TRUE
          Commentary:  This depends on whether the expunging part of "I
pay
            a fee of 1 kudo to expunge 0.5 blots" runs afoul of integer
            arithmetic.  It doesn't; Rule 754 specifies real numbers.

CFJ 1495  "Eris successfully increased eir Lobbying Strength by 3 in eir
[TRUE]     message dated Thu, 1 Apr 2004 17:23:35 -0600."
          4/2    Called by Eris
          4/2-4  Assigned to Elysion, who judges TRUE
          Commentary:  This depends on whether the fee part of "I pay
            a fee of 1 kudo to expunge 0.5 blots" runs afoul of integer
            arithmetic.  It doesn't; Rule 754 specifies real numbers.
          Judge's argument (summary):  Even if Eris had insufficient
kudos,
            fee-based actions are successful until challenged, and the
action
            in question has not yet been challenged.

CFJ 1496  "CFJ 1495 constitutes a challenge under rule 1941 to Eris's
[FALSE]    attempt to increase eir Lobbying Strength in eir message
dated
           Thu, 1 Apr 2004 17:23:35 -0600."
          4/4     Called by Elysion
          4/5-11  Assigned to OscarMeyr, who judges FALSE
          Judge's refutation (summary):  CFJs and challenges are
different in
            several ways, including being directed to different Officers
            (Clerk of the Courts vs. Herald).
          Commentary:  A judgement of TRUE would have invalidated Judge
            Elysion's arguments on CFJ 1495, making that CFJ a likely
            candidate for appeal.

CFJ 1497  "If a person who is a player of both Agora and Claustronomic
[TRUE]     ceases to be a player of Agora, then e also ceases to be a
Appealed   player of Claustronomic."
          4/8   Called by Maud
          4/8   Assigned to Murphy, who judges TRUE
          4/8   Appealed by Maud, Eris, and Goethe
          4/10  Appeal assigned to Sherlock, Eris, and Michael
          4/10  Eris moves to REMAND
          4/13  Michael moves to REMAND
          Caller's argument (summary):  C-as-a-nomic does not equate
"player
            of C-as-a-nomic" with "member of C-as-an-Agoran-contest", so
the
            statement should not be judged TRUE.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Regardless of C-as-a-nomic's
stance,
            Agora defines membership based on C-as-an-Agoran-contest.
          Appelant Maud's argument (summary):  But the last clause of
the
            statement asked about "player of C-as-a-nomic", not about
"member
            of C-as-an-Agoran-contest".

CFJ 1498  "No two Rules may legally have the same Title."
          4/12  Called by Wes
          4/18  Assigned to Sir Toby
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rules are Rule-defined
entities.  Rule
            Titles are names.  Rule 1586 (Definition and Continuity of
            Entities) applies.
