ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Clarify Contest Entry Fees" by OscarMeyr - Proposal 4478 failed quorum 4/14 -
     Complacent Oligarchy - Proposal 4484 adopted 4/22
   Rule 1539 (Regulations and Membership of Contests) no longer requires
     payment of the Entry Fee if the Contest does not have one.

"Default Budgets and Election Errors" by Steve - Proposal 4474 failed quorum
     4/7 - Complacent Oligarchy - Proposal 4480 adopted 4/22
   Nominations without a Proto-Budget are automatically associated with one
     identical to the current Budget.  (If that is invalid, then the
     nomination is automatically withdrawn.)
   Election results are valid unless challenged within seven days.

"Of what worth honor?" by Michael, Goethe, Murphy, et al. - adopted 4/23
   Rubberstamping, absolution, and debate (changing the chamber of a
     proposal) are generalized into energetic actions, and made 1
     support/Currency more expensive.
   Each Player has a number of Kudos.  Fees are in kudos.
   Once a week, a Player may transfer a kudo from one Player to another
     (e cannot be the recipient), with reasons, provided e emself has
     at least one kudo.
   Patent Titles may be Ephemeral.
   Boons and Albatrosses are Ephemeral Patent Titles.
   Daffodills are generic Boons.
   Carcasses are generic Albatrosses.
   The Herald's Budget includes the Tabla Rasa, an integer between 5 and 25.
   Each quarter, each Player's kudos are set equal to the Tabla Rasa, plus
     the number of eir boons, minus the number of eir albatrosses; Agora's
     kudos are set equal to the Tabla Rasa times the number of players; and
     all Ephemeral Patent Titles are revoked.
   The Tabla Rasa is initially 5.
   Stems, Indulgences, VEs, Papyri, and Land are redeemed in Daffodils.
   Fees are in kudos.  Agora's kudos are increased by the fee.  If an action
     is attempted with insufficient kudos, and a Player's announcement of it
     is confirmed, then the recordkeepor must either (with support) announce
     that it did not occur, or (without 3 objections) announce that it did
     occur.  In the latter case, the Player pays what kudos e can, and receives
     albatrosses for the difference.
   New Players receive twice the Tabla Rasa.
   Mentors receive the Boon of Mentorship; the Protege receives the Boon of
     Politeness.
   Salaries, the Speaker's Gratuity, and the Distributor's Gratuity are 
replaced
     with Daffodils.
   Judicial Salaries are replaced with the Boon of Wisdom, and their revocation
     with the Albatross of Foolishness.
   Birthday gifts are replaced with the Boon of Celebration, and birthday
     contest awards with the Patent Title of Nth Anniversary Ribbon.
   Changing role early costs 2 or 6 kudos.
   Monks are repealed.
   Successful Rebels receive the Ephemeral Patent Title of Rebel Hero.
   The Indulgence tax for successful Rebellion is repealed.
   The GWotO's Budget contains the Oligarchy Charge Requirement (a positive
     integer less than 10, initially 6) and the Oligarchic Term (a number of
     days between 30 and 90, initially 60).
   Any Player may join the Oligarchy by paying the Charge Requirement (halved
     for Politicians), and buy additional terms for the same price.  E is
     removed after the end of eir term(s).
   Appointed Oligarchs get half a term.
   The Treasuror is merged into the Notary.
   Papyri are repealed.
   On Democratic Proposals, non-Oligarchs have a Voting Power of two plus eir
     Voting Potential; Oligarchs, one plus eir Voting Potential.
   Voting Potentials are zeroed monthly.  A Player may buy a Voting 
Potential of
     N (positive integer) by paying the Oligarchy Charge Requirement times N.
   Simplifying the Rules via repeal gains the Ephemeral Patent Title of
     Tapecutter.
   Proposal adoption during Grace Period gains the Ephemeral Patent Title of
     Prodigy.
   Embezzlement is repealed.
   Looting Auctions are repealed.
   Levying Taxes is repealed.
   Speaker's Patronage is replaced with the Ephemeral Patent Title of Gold 
Star.
   Non-standard Auction procedures are repealed.

   Land is repealed.

"Fix PWIN" by Peekee - Proposal 4473 failed quorum 4/7 - Complacent Oligarchy
     - Proposal 4479 rejected 4/22
   PWIN is set to 100.  This repairs part of Rule 1990 (Points Contests)
     that was accidentally broken when Teams were introduced.
   PPP is repealed.  (This would break a different part of Rule 1990.)

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"First ANF Fix" by Steve
   Change "energetic" (obsolete term) to "progressive" in Rule 1986.

"Fix Dereliction of Duty" by root - Proposal 4481 failed quorum 4/22 -
     Complacent Oligarchy
   Officers cited for Dereliction of Duty are removed, not retired.
   Blob is mauve.

"Fix PWIN V2" by Peekee - Proposal 4485 failed quorum 4/23 - Complacent
     Oligarchy
   PWIN is set to 100.  This repairs part of Rule 1990 (Points Contests)
     that was accidentally broken when Teams were introduced.

"More Useful Stem Weather" by OscarMeyr - Proposal 4482 failed quorum 4/22 -
     Complacent Oligarchy
   The destruction phase of Weather remains limited to the Bank's holdings,
     but the creation phase is no longer proportionally limited.

"Streamline complacency" by root - Proposal 4487
   If there are too few Oligarchs to meet quorum, then the Assessor may publish
     a Notice of Complacency before the end of the Voting Period.

"Team Shuffling" by Peekee - Proposal 4483 failed quorum 4/22 - Complacent
     Oligarchy
   Upon a Team Win, the highest-Scoring Player in the highest-Scoring Team
     is assigned to the lowest-Scoring Team, and the lowest-Scoring Player
     in the lowest-Scoring Team is assigned to even out Team sizes.  Ties
     are broken by the Scorekeepor's choice.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"ANF bugs and consequences" by Steve
   Significance (Historical, Hysterical, Ephemeral) is a Patent Title switch.
   Only Historical Patent Titles can gain points.
   Property of dissolute entities may be transferred to its Mintor or
     Recordkeepor, rather than to the Bank.
   If a type of Property ceases to exist, then debts in it cease to exist, and
     the former recordkeepor shall publish a closing report.
   Destroying a type of Property that you owe is the Crime of Writing Bad
     Checks.
