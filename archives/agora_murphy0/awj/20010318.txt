     [This space for rent - 1 VE, Papyrus, or Indulgence]


ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Auction Fractional VEs" by Blob - Proposal 4117 adopted 3/5
  VEs are auctioned in units of the MUQ of VEs.

"Patch Up Dependent Actions" by Ziggy - Proposal 4121 adopted 3/13
  A Player may not Support emself.
  The Rule defining Dependent Actions is increased to Power=2.
  A Rule defining a specific Dependent Action may restrict the eligibility of
    Players to Support or Object to that action.

"Zombie Upkeep" (proto by Steve; duplicated and Proposed by Goethe) - Proposal
    4118 adopted 3/5
  Zombie upkeep is increased from one Indulgence per quarter to one Indulgence
    per month, and if the debt is not paid as soon as possible, then the Zombie
    is lost.

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

"Clarity of Communication" by Goethe - Proposal 4115 rejected 3/5
  A Communication is a single declaration with a specific effect.
  A Communication has effect only if it has exactly one reasonable
    interpretation.
  A message is a (possibly empty) set of Collections to be sent to a Public
    Forum.
  A message's Communications have effect only if they have an unambiguous
    order.

"Start the Sanity-Insanity" by harvel - Proposal 4120 rejected 3/13
  Each non-Senator receives 100 Stems.

"The CotC's Budget" by Blob - Proposal 4119 rejected 3/13
  The CotC's Budget specifies the penalty for each Crime (from 0 to 15) and
    Infraction (0 to 5, except Dereliction of Duty which may be penalized as if
    it were a Crime).

"VE Upkeep" by Blob - Proposal 4116 rejected 3/5
  The Treasuror's Budget contains the VE Upkeep, which is from 0 to 2 times the
    Basic Officer's Salary.
  The Treasuror may amend eir Budget's upkeeps Without 3 Objections.  E may
    still amend eir Budget's compensations With Support.
  At the beginning of the second month of each quarter, the Assessor bills each
    non-Bank entity for the VE Upkeep for each VE it owns.  If any part of such
    a debt remains outstanding for a week, the Assessor may forgive the rest of
    the debt and bill the entity for a corresponding quantity of VEs instead.
    (This clock stops running while the debt is disputed or the Player is On
    Hold.)

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Allow Tax Exemptions" by Murphy
  Rule 1853 (Levying Taxes) permits exemptions.

"Bonds" by Hooloovoo
  Bonds are Property.  The Recordkeepor of Bonds is the Fed.
  Bonds cost 50 Stems each, have a term from 1 week to 1 year, and may be
    redeemed at the interest rate currently in effect for the Bond's term
    length.

"Bonds" by Kelly
  Bonds are Property.  The Recordkeepor of Bonds is the Usuror.
  Bonds with the same Issuer, face value, and maturity date form a species, and
    are fungible.
  Players, Groups, Contests, and the Bank have Bond Issuance Authority.
  A mature Bond is redeemed by transferring it to its Issuer for the purpose of
    redemption.  The Issuer owes the transferor the Bond's face value.  (If the
    Bond is immature, then the Issuer owes the transferor the Bond instead.)
  Redeemed Bonds may not be further transferred.
  The Usuror's Budget contains the Basic Fee for creating one or more of a
    species of Bond.  (The Bank is exempt from this fee.)
  The Bank may issue Bonds (With 2 Supporters) and Auction Bonds (Without 3
    Objections).
  An unredeemed Bond matures immediately, and is deemed to have been redeemed,
    if its Issuer ceases to have an Executor.
  The Bank may mint Bank Currencies as follows:
    (a) Up to five times the Basic Officer Salary, within thirty days after a
        new Player registers (With 2 Supporters).
    (b) VEs equal to the VE Surplus minus the Bank's VE holdings (With 2
        Supporters).
    (c) At any time (Without Objection).

"Cleanup the Transfer Tax" by Elysion
  Pro-rated Zombie Maintenance is billed by the Registrar (not the Herald),
    and is pro-rated according to normal Zombie Maintenance being monthly
    rather than quarterly.

"Create Bards" by Goethe
  Anyone may grant Patent Title of Bard With 2 Supporters, or With Support if
    both e and the Supporter are Bards.
  Anyone may revoke Patent Title of Bard With 3 Supporters, or With 2
    Supporters if both e and the Supporters are Bards.

"End the Popularity Contest" by Elysion
  Kudos are repealed.

"Expanding Abbreviations" by harvel
  Abbreviations are amended to a consistent format.

"Fix blanket quieting" by Tim
  Making another Player Quiet is limited to once every 24 hours.

"Fix double Auction debts" by Steve (duplicated by Goethe) - Proposal 4122
  Rule 1887 double-bills Auction winners - once explicitly, and once by
    requiring the Auctioneer to bill them.  The former clause is repealed.

"Fix Rule 1953" by Hooloovoo
  Rule 1953 (Sane Proposals) claims precedence over other Rules, particularly
    Rule 1950 (Voting Power).

"Rational Objections" by Lindrum - Proposal 4123
  Players Objecting to an action must provide reasons.

"Restore Our Sanity!" by Steve (duplicated by Goethe)
  Rule 1953 (Sane Proposals) clearly takes precedence over Rule 1950 (Voting
    Power).

"Streamline Rebellion" by Murphy
  Upon a successful Rebellion, the Registrar (not the Herald) levies an
    Indulgence tax.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Bluff Auctions" by Blob
  Cards are Property.  Their Recordkeepor is the Dealer.
  The Deck and the Pile are entities.
  A random Card may be bought for 10 Stems.
  A Player may call for a redeal, Without Objection by Players with four or
    more cards.  If this happens, then all Cards return to the Deck, and each
    Player receives as many random Cards as e had before.
  A Hand is a set of one to five Cards.
  For Bluff Auctions:
    * The Dealer is Auctioneer.
    * A Player becomes a bidder by transferring one or more Hands to the Pile.
    * Initial bids (per hand) are at most 20 times the MUQ of the Auction
        Currency.
    * Non-winning bids may be raised to a value that exceeds the highest bid
        by at most 20 times the MUQ of the Auction Currency.
    * Bids may be cancelled.  The Hand is given back, and the bidder owes the
        bid to the Bank.
    * At the end of the Auction, each bidder owes eir non-winning bids (if any)
        to the Bank.
  Papyri, VEs, and Indulgences are auctioned using Bluff Auctions.

"Fix 'Complacent Oligarchy'" by Steve
  Ordinary Proposals failing Quorum and becoming Democratic are implemented by
    adding a Democratic Distributable copy of the Proposal to the Pool.

"Fix Rule 1585" by harvel
  Rule 1585 (Official Duties upon Officer Change) is amended by removing
    obsolete text that refers to how ASAP used to require actions to be
    performed in a certain order.

"Fix Rule 1714" by harvel
  The order of events when deregistering a Lawless Player is clarified.

"Fix the Rule that Never Ends" by harvel
  Fix the format of Rule 1794 (Classes of Orders), which was damaged when
    clause (3) was deleted.

"Group Bidding" by Blob
  Players may transfer Stems to eir Group.
  A Mature Group (one at least three months old) may have a Role, and may bid
    in Auctions.  If it bids in an Oligarch Auction, then it must name one of
    its members, and the bid is cancelled if that member leaves the Group
    during the Auction.
  All Groups are Immature for three months after this Proposal is adopted.

"Help New Players" by harvel
  Players in eir Grace Period are Unready, unless they claim Readiness.
  Rule 698 (Always an Eligible Judge) explicitly asserts its ability to require
    Inactive Players to act.
  Unready Players are omitted from the Order of Succession.
  Ordering an Unready Player to submit a Formal Apology is optional.
  Unready Players are subject to half the usual Blot penalties.
  The New Player Award is removed from the Treasuror's Budget and is equal to
    three-quarters of the average holdings of Players not in eir Grace Period.

"Increase Currency Awards for New Players" by harvel
  New Players get 2 Papyri (not just 1) and 1 Indulgence.

"Public Reforum I" by harvel
  The phrase "the Public Forum" is abandoned, in favor of "a Public Forum".
  Synonyms for posting-to-the-Public-Forum apply even to optional actions.

"Public Reforum II" by harvel
  The phrase "the Public Forum" is abandoned in many Power=1 Rules.
  Rule 1565 (Dismissal of a CFJ) is modified by replacing "can not logically
    admit to either being TRUE or FALSE" with "is logically inconsistent".

"Public Reforum III" by harvel
  The phrase "the Public Forum" is abandoned in these Power=2 Rules:
    Rule 376 (When Proposals Take Effect)
    Rule 1016 (Putting Oneself On Hold)

"Simple Pragmatic Transfers" by Blob
  Performing an illegitimate transfer is the Crime of Laundering.
  Stem transfers are illegitimate, except for
    a) from the Bank
    b) to the Bank
    c) from an Organization to Players, within seven days of obtaining the
       Stems transferred

"Various Minor Changes" by harvel
  Rules 1884 (Zombie Masters) and 1886 (Returning to Life; renamed to
    "Vivification Due to Noise") are simplified by removing redundant language.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1268  "Peekee has committed the Crime of Application Fraud as described in
[TRUE]     Rule 1626 by claiming that eir Application (included in Evidence
           below) was signed by Players who did not actually sign that
           Application."
          2/7   Called by Wes
          2/7   Assigned to lee, who Judges TRUE
          2/8   Appealed by Peekee
          2/10  Appeal assigned to Chuck, Steve, and (improperly) Wes
          2/15  Steve moves to overturn and reassign
          2/16  Appeal assigned to Chuck, Steve, and Elysion
          2/16  Chuck moves to overturn and reassign
          2/17  Elysion moves to overturn and reassign
          2/25  Reassigned to Razl, who Judges TRUE at some point between 2/25
                  and 3/14
          3/15  Peekee appeals Razl's redundant Order to assign Blots, as lee
                  had already issued such an Order
          Caller's argument (summary):  Peekee published a Dissenting Position,
            then changed it to Concurring and got some signatures, then sent
            the Dissenting copy by mistake.
          Counterargument:  X is the action Peekee performed.  Y is the action
            Peekee believed e was performing at the time.  Peekee believed that
            X was a Crime (or would have if anyone had pointed it out), but did
            not believe that Y was a Crime.  If eir belief about Y is what
            matters, then Rule 1575's last paragraph forgives Peekee.
          Commentary:  lee submitted eir Judgement early by mistake (by eir own
            admission) and had not yet addressed Peekee's defense.
          Judge Razl's argument (summary):  The action Peekee actually
            performed is what matters.

CFJ 1274  "t's Order of Wed, 14 Feb 2001, 'I order everyone to make fewer
[TRUE]     bids in the next auction.' was improperly or invalidly executed."
          2/15     Called by Oerjan
          2/15-21  Assigned to Evantine, who Judges TRUE
          2/16     Evantine makes a Motion to emself that e issue a Judicial
                     Order, an Order to Compel, for the Clerk of the Courts to
                     stay t's Order as soon as possible; e then grants the
                     Motion and issues the Judicial Order
          2/21     Evantime Orders emself to vacate t's Order
          2/22     Appealed by Taral
          3/8      Crito submits a Concurring Opinion; Oerjan and Elysion sign
          Judge's argument (summary):  The Rules do not require, permit, or
            describe this type of Order, so it is invalid.
          Counterargument (summary):  Game custom holds that arbitrary Private
            Orders are valid, unless Judged "improper" (a deliberately variable
            standard).
          Concurring argument (summary):  Players who made no bids in the
            previous auction were ordered by t to make a negative number of
            bids in the next auction.

CFJ 1276  "An entity is a Player if, and only if, the Rules cannot distinguish
[FALSE]    that entity from a Player."
          2/19      Called by Goethe
          2/25-3/4  Assigned to Lindrum, who Judges FALSE
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Some entities are non-Players despite
            the Rules not specifying whether or not they are Players.

CFJ 1278  "The Assessor has announced the results of the voting on Proposal
[TRUE]     4111."
          2/21      Called by Murphy
          2/26-3/8  Assigned to Syllepsis, who Judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  The Assessor's announcement specified
            the Vote count correctly, but specified the result of that Vote
            count (adoption or rejection) incorrectly.
          Judge's argument (summary):  Later in the message, the Assessor
            specified the result of the Vote count correctly.

CFJ 1279  "Proposal 4112 is Democratic."
[FALSE]   2/21      Called by Murphy
Appealed  2/26-3/2  Assigned to pTang, who Judges FALSE
          3/3-5     Appealed by Murphy, Taral, and Elysion
          Caller's argument (summary):  If CFJ 1278 is false, then so is this;
            otherwise, while Proposal 4111 is adopted too early to place a
            requirement on the Assessor to announce Proposal 4112's failing
            quorum, it may still cause Proposal 4112 to become Democratic upon
            the Assessor's announcement.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Assessor t's announcement that
            Proposal 4112 failed quorum was not required by Proposal 4111, so
            it was not "such an announcement" to cause Proposal 4112 to become
            Democratic.

CFJ 1280  "The Private, Binding Agreement knows as the Articles of
Dismissed  Confederation of the United Nomic Dead Groups affects the Votes of
           the Anemocrats."
          2/28     Called by Peekee
          3/3-3/8  Assigned to Oerjan, who dismisses the CFJ
          3/3      Motion 1280.1 by Taral:  Ordinancekeepor of the Anemocrats
                     Ordered to publish the Agreement
          3/4      Goethe, Syllepsis, and Ziggy sign this Application:
                     PUBLIC AGREEMENT, BINDING BY THE RULES
                      We, the Members of the Anemocrats, publicly agree that
                      The Private, Binding Agreement knows as the Articles of
                      Confederation of the United Nomic Dead Groups affects the
                      Votes of the Anemocrats, and affected the Votes of the
                      Anemocrats from the time of the Group's Formation to (at
                      least) the time of the execution of this Application.
          3/4      Oerjan denies Motion 1280.1
          3/4      Motions 1280.2 through 1280.7 by Oerjan:  Dave, Evantine,
                     Goethe, Steve, Syllepsis, Ziggy each ordered to send the
                     Judge the Agreement within 72 hours
          3/4      Oerjan finds Goethe, Syllepsis, and Ziggy's public agreement
                     insufficient evidence
          3/8      Oerjan denies Motions 1280.2 through 1280.7
          3/8-12   Appealed by Taral and Murphy

CFJ 1281  "The Voting Power of Player Kelly on Proposal 4120 is two."
[TRUE]    3/6       Called by Kelly
          3/8-3/15  Assigned to Hooloovoo, who Judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1950 (Voting Power) takes
            precedence over Rule 1953 (Sane Proposals).
          Counterargument:  See CFJ 1282.

CFJ 1282  "Maximum Voting Power, as referenced in Rule 1953, is a different
           quantity from an Entity's maximum Voting Power, as referenced in
           Rule 1950."
          3/6  Called by Syllepsis
          3/8  Assigned to Stuart
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1953 may deem a Vote invalid (i.e.
            without effect), though Rule 1950 allows it to be cast.  For the
            final clause of Rule 1953 to conflict with Rule 1950, it would have
            to refer to the casting of Votes, which would make the clause
            redundant with the previous text of Rule 1953.

CFJ 1283  "On or about Tue, 06 Mar 2001 16:04:06 -0800, Hoovooloo violated Rule
           1729."
          3/6  Called by Kelly
          3/8  Assigned to Murphy

CFJ 1284  "On or about Tue, Tue, 6 Mar 2001 13:18:41 -0600, Kelly violated Rule
[FALSE]    1729."
          3/6    Called by Hooloovoo
          3/8-9  Assigned to Evantine, who Judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Kelly discussed in a-d how e might Vote
            on Insane Proposal 4120.
          Counterargument:  Kelly did not discuss any Votes that were actually
            cast.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Proposal 4120 is Insane - its mixed
            case title is not part of its text, as clearly stated by harvel, as
            well as by Rule 1485 (Titles for Rules).  However, while Kelly
            "bended" Rule 1729, e did not break it.


OFFICES/OLIGARCHS

      Ziggy reveals Article 19 of the UNDEAD Agreement, which deems the

        Articles by an outside agency.  (Article 19 itself, however, may be
        revealed without triggering itself.)  Article 19 is probably
        ineffective, though, because non-members are in no way bound to

ERRATA
------

Syllepsis became a Scribe on February 6 (see CFJ 1267); so eir bids in the
recent Auction for 8 Papyri were valid; so that Auction awarded 4 Papyri to
Steve, 3 to Oerjan, and 1 to Syllepsis, at 110 Stems per Papyrus.

harvel Proposed "The Speed of Light in a Vacuum".

Syllepsis proto-Proposed "Acolytes and Zombies".
