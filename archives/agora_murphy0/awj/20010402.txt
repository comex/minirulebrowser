ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Allow Tax Exemptions" by Murphy - Proposal 4127 adopted 3/26
  Rule 1853 (Levying Taxes) permits exemptions.

"Bonds" by Kelly - Proposal 4126 adopted 3/27
  Bonds are Property.  The Recordkeepor of Bonds is the Usuror.
  Bonds with the same Issuer, face value, and maturity date form a species, and
    are fungible.
  Players, Groups, Contests, and the Bank have Bond Issuance Authority.
  A mature Bond is redeemed by transferring it to its Issuer for the purpose of
    redemption.  The Issuer owes the transferor the Bond's face value.  (If the
    Bond is immature, then the Issuer owes the transferor the Bond instead.)
  Redeemed Bonds may not be further transferred.
  The Usuror's Budget contains the Basic Fee for creating one or more of a
    species of Bond.  (The Bank is exempt from this fee.)
  The Bank may issue Bonds (With 2 Supporters) and Auction Bonds (Without 3
    Objections).
  An unredeemed Bond matures immediately, and is deemed to have been redeemed,
    if its Issuer ceases to have an Executor.
  The Bank may mint Bank Currencies as follows:
    (a) Up to five times the Basic Officer Salary, within thirty days after a
        new Player registers (With 2 Supporters).
    (b) VEs equal to the VE Surplus minus the Bank's VE holdings (With 2
        Supporters).
    (c) At any time (Without Objection).

"Create Bards" by Goethe - Proposal 4129 adopted 3/26
  Anyone may grant Patent Title of Bard With 2 Supporters, or With Support if
    both e and the Supporter are Bards.
  Anyone may revoke Patent Title of Bard With 3 Supporters, or With 2
    Supporters if both e and the Supporters are Bards.

"End the Popularity Contest" by Elysion - Proposal 4124 adopted 3/26
  Kudos are repealed.

"Fix double Auction debts" by Steve (duplicated by Goethe) - Proposal 4122
    adopted 3/20
  Rule 1887 double-bills Auction winners - once explicitly, and once by
    requiring the Auctioneer to bill them.  The former clause is repealed.

"Rational Objections" by Lindrum - Proposal 4123 adopted 3/20 (but insufficient
    Power to have any effect)
  Players Objecting to an action must provide reasons.

"Streamline Rebellion" by Murphy - Proposal 4128 adopted 3/26
  Upon a successful Rebellion, the Registrar (not the Herald) levies an
    Indulgence tax.

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

"Bonds" by Hooloovoo - Proposal 4125 rejected 3/27
  Bonds are Property.  The Recordkeepor of Bonds is the Fed.
  Bonds cost 50 Stems each, have a term from 1 week to 1 year, and may be
    redeemed at the interest rate currently in effect for the Bond's term
    length.

"Make VEs Interesting" by Murphy - Proposal 4131 rejected 3/27
["Proposal 4130" omitted part of the text, and hence was not a Proposal.]
  VE supply (by tenths) is made similar to Papyrus supply.
  Oligarchy Bids are in VEs.

[old]
"Clarity of Communication" by Goethe - Proposal 4115 rejected 3/5
  A Communication is a single declaration with a specific effect.
  A Communication has effect only if it has exactly one reasonable
    interpretation.
  A message is a (possibly empty) set of Collections to be sent to a Public
    Forum.
  A message's Communications have effect only if they have an unambiguous
    order.

"Start the Sanity-Insanity" by harvel - Proposal 4120 rejected 3/13
  Each non-Senator receives 100 Stems.

"The CotC's Budget" by Blob - Proposal 4119 rejected 3/13
  The CotC's Budget specifies the penalty for each Crime (from 0 to 15) and
    Infraction (0 to 5, except Dereliction of Duty which may be penalized as if
    it were a Crime).

"VE Upkeep" by Blob - Proposal 4116 rejected 3/5
  The Treasuror's Budget contains the VE Upkeep, which is from 0 to 2 times the
    Basic Officer's Salary.
  The Treasuror may amend eir Budget's upkeeps Without 3 Objections.  E may
    still amend eir Budget's compensations With Support.
  At the beginning of the second month of each quarter, the Assessor bills each
    non-Bank entity for the VE Upkeep for each VE it owns.  If any part of such
    a debt remains outstanding for a week, the Assessor may forgive the rest of
    the debt and bill the entity for a corresponding quantity of VEs instead.
    (This clock stops running while the debt is disputed or the Player is On
    Hold.)

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Assistant Director of Personnel" by Murphy - Proposal 4142
  Grand Warden of the Oligarchy is split into two Offices:  one that tracks
    Officers (Assistant Director of Personnel) and one that tracks Oligarchs
    (GWotO).  Both Offices then go up for Election immediately.

"Cleanup the Transfer Tax" by Elysion - Proposal 4132
  Pro-rated Zombie Maintenance is billed by the Registrar (not the Herald),
    and is pro-rated according to normal Zombie Maintenance being monthly
    rather than quarterly.

"Fix blanket quieting" by Tim - Proposal 4133
  Making another Player Quiet is limited to once every 24 hours.

"Fix Rule 1585" by harvel - Proposal 4135
  Rule 1585 (Official Duties upon Officer Change) is amended by removing
    obsolete text that refers to how ASAP used to require actions to be
    performed in a certain order.

"Fix Rule 1714" by harvel - Proposal 4136
  The order of events when deregistering a Lawless Player is clarified.

"Fix Rule 1953" by Hooloovoo
  Rule 1953 (Sane Proposals) claims precedence over other Rules pertaining to
    Voting Power, particularly Rule 1950 (Voting Power) which currently makes
    Rule 1953 ineffective.  (See CFJ 1282.)

"Fix the Rule that Never Ends" by harvel - Proposal 4137
  Fix the format of Rule 1794 (Classes of Orders), which was damaged when
    clause (3) was deleted.

"More Ways to Win (redux)" by Murphy - Proposal 4138
  A Player Wins if eir Insane Proposal is distributed and gets no FOR Votes.
  [This was part of a previous adopted Proposal that had insufficient Power to
    make this change.]

"Points Adjustments" by Wes - Proposal 4141
  Rule 1929 (Points) is amended to eliminate mention of Players "having"
    Points, and to say that Score changes not following the regulations are
    "ineffective" rather than "invalid".
  Rule 1930 (Scoring) is amended to award 5 Points for a Patent Title (but only
    if it has not been held within the past week), and to not award Points for
    a Degree already held previously.
  Rule 1923 (Defined Unique Patent Titles) is amended so that "Distributor" is
    no longer a Patent Title.

"Restore Our Sanity!" by Steve (duplicated by Goethe) - Proposal 4139
  Rule 1953 (Sane Proposals) clearly takes precedence over Rule 1950 (Voting
    Power).

"Various Minor Changes" by harvel - Proposal 4134
  Rules 1884 (Zombie Masters) and 1886 (Returning to Life; renamed to
    "Vivification Due to Noise") are simplified by removing redundant language.

"What is Public?" by Wes
  "Public" means "sent to all Players".
  Messages sent to a Public Forum are deemed always public.
  "Discussion Forum" is defined.  Messages sent to one are deemed never public.
  All other mention of "Public Forum" is reworded with "public" or "publicly".

"Yet Another Cleanup Proposal" by Wes - Proposal 4140
  Rule 1565 (Dismissal of a CFJ) is amended to pay a standard Judicial Salary,
    rather than a hardcoded 20-Stem salary.
  Rules 1893 (The Treasuror's Budget) and 1940 (Periodic Compensations) are
    amended to require listing all Offices, even non-wage-earning ones.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"And The Fix" by Goethe
  Amend Rule 1539 (Regulations and Membership of Contests) to restrict Entry
    Fees to Currencies transferrable directly between Players.

"Bank Loans" by Blob
  The Bank may buy Bonds for Stems, at rates specified in the Usuror's Budget.
  The Credit Limit is an amount of Stems from 0 to 1000.  No Player may sell
    Bonds to the Bank equivalent to more than this amount of Stems.
  The Treasuror may, With Support, stop or start the Bank from buying Bonds.

"Bluff Auctions" by Blob
  Cards are Property.  Their Recordkeepor is the Dealer.
  The Deck and the Pile are entities.
  The Dealer's Budget specifies the cost of buying a random Card from the Deck,
    and the maximum bid and raise in a Bluff Auction.  Each of these values is
    from 10 to 100 Stems.
  A Player may call for a redeal, Without Objection by Players with four or
    more cards.  If this happens, then all Cards return to the Deck, and each
    Player receives as many random Cards as e had before.
  A Hand is a set of one to five Cards.
  For Bluff Auctions:
    * The Dealer is Auctioneer.
    * A Player becomes a bidder by transferring one or more Hands to the Pile.
    * Non-winning bids may be raised.
    * Bids may be cancelled.  The Hand is given back, and the bidder owes the
        bid to the Bank.
    * At the end of the Auction, each bidder owes eir non-winning bids (if any)
        to the Bank.
  Papyri, VEs, and Indulgences are auctioned using Bluff Auctions.

"Ephemeral rules" by Tim
  Rules have Attributes.
  "Ephemeral" is an Attribute.
  An Active Player may make a Rule Ephemeral, Without Objection.
  An Active Player may make a Rule non-Ephemeral, With 3 Supporters.
  An Active Player may repeal an Ephemeral Rule, With 2 Supporters, if that
    Rule has not been invoked for three months.  This carries a 30-Stem bonus.

"Kitu" by Wes
  Kitu are categories of Property, tracked by the Mtunza.
  When the Rules award a Kitu to a Player, the Player must Summon it within a
    week.  E may never Summon the same Kitu more than once a month.
  A Player is the Executor of eir Kitu.
  Sauti Kitu are awarded for Winning the Game, and may cast one Vote on any one
    Proposal.

"Mentor's Bonus" by Blob
  During the four weeks after the end of a Player's Grace Period, the Player
    (if not a Zombie) may award a Mentor's Bonus to one other Player.

"Proposals made Democratic by the Speaker are Sane" by Murphy
  Self-explanatory.

"Sane Power" by t
  Rule 1950 (Voting Power) is amended to explicitly define Voting Power in all
    situations (rather than deferring some situations to other Rules), and to
    clarify timing issues.
  Rule 1953 (Sanity) is amended to explicitly invalidate certain attempted
    Votes, rather than adjusting Voting Power.
  Rule 683 (Voting on Proposals) has its Power increased to 2, and is amended
    to allow only Rules of at least Power 2 to restrict legal Votes, and to
    leave it to the Assessor's discretion to determine synonyms for FOR,
    AGAINST, or ABSTAIN.

"The Auctioneer Started It!" by Murphy
  The default Auctioneer is, not the Speaker, but the Player who initiates the
    Auction.  (However, the default identity of *that* Player is the Speaker.)

"Votes divided" by Oerjan
  Fractional Votes are permitted.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1268  "Peekee has committed the Crime of Application Fraud as described in
[TRUE]     Rule 1626 by claiming that eir Application (included in Evidence
           below) was signed by Players who did not actually sign that
           Application."
          2/7      Called by Wes
          2/7      Assigned to lee, who Judges TRUE, issues a Sentencing Order,
                     and Orders a Formal Apology
          2/8      lee's Judgement Appealed by Peekee
          2/10     Appeal assigned to Chuck, Steve, and (improperly) Wes
          2/15     Steve moves to overturn and reassign
          2/16     Appeal assigned to Chuck, Steve, and Elysion
          2/16     Chuck moves to overturn and reassign
          2/17     Elysion moves to overturn and reassign
          2/25     Reassigned to Razl, who Judges TRUE at some point between
                     2/25 and 3/14, issues a Sentencing Order, and Orders a
                     Formal Apology
          3/15     Peekee appeals Razl's Sentencing Order, as lee had already
                     issued one
          3/18     Razl penalizes Peekee for Failure to Apologize
          3/18     Elysion and Wes Appeal Razl's Sentencing Order
          3/18     Appeal of Razl's Sentencing Order assigned to Elysion,
                     Steve, and Ziggy
          3/22     Razl's Judgement Appealed by Peekee
          3/22-24  Steve, Ziggy, and Elysion sustain Razl's Sentencing Order
          3/23     Appeal of Judgement assigned to Taral, Steve, and pTang
          3/23-24  Steve, Taral, and pTang sustain Razl's Judgement
          Caller's argument (summary):  Peekee published a Dissenting Position,
            then changed it to Concurring and got some signatures, then sent
            the Dissenting copy by mistake.
          Counterargument:  X is the action Peekee performed.  Y is the action
            Peekee believed e was performing at the time.  Peekee believed that
            X was a Crime (or would have if anyone had pointed it out), but did
            not believe that Y was a Crime.  If eir belief about Y is what
            matters, then Rule 1575's last paragraph forgives Peekee.
          Commentary:  lee submitted eir Judgement early by mistake (by eir own
            admission) and had not yet addressed Peekee's defense.
          Judge Razl's argument (summary):  The action Peekee actually
            performed is what matters.

CFJ 1277  "Lindrum's message
<http://www.escribe.com/games/agora-business/m2571.html>
[TRUE]     was sent after the end of the Oligarch Auction announced in Murphy's
           message <http://www.escribe.com/games/agora-business/m2530.html>."
          2/25       Called by Ziggy
          2/25-3/18  Assigned to Grech, who defaults
          3/18       Assigned to pTang, who Judges TRUE

CFJ 1279  "Proposal 4112 is Democratic."
[FALSE]   2/21      Called by Murphy
Appealed  2/26-3/2  Assigned to pTang, who Judges FALSE
          3/3-5     Appealed by Murphy, Taral, and Elysion
          3/30      Appeal assigned to lee, Steve, and Wes
          Caller's argument (summary):  If CFJ 1278 is false, then so is this;
            otherwise, while Proposal 4111 is adopted too early to place a
            requirement on the Assessor to announce Proposal 4112's failing
            quorum, it may still cause Proposal 4112 to become Democratic upon
            the Assessor's announcement.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Assessor t's announcement that
            Proposal 4112 failed quorum was not required by Proposal 4111, so
            it was not "such an announcement" to cause Proposal 4112 to become
            Democratic.

CFJ 1282  "Maximum Voting Power, as referenced in Rule 1953, is a different
[FALSE]    quantity from an Entity's maximum Voting Power, as referenced in
           Rule 1950."
          3/6  Called by Syllepsis
          3/8  Assigned to Stuart
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1953 may deem a Vote invalid (i.e.
            without effect), though Rule 1950 allows it to be cast.  For the
            final clause of Rule 1953 to conflict with Rule 1950, it would have
            to refer to the casting of Votes, which would make the clause
            redundant with the previous text of Rule 1953.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Rule 1953 causes extra Votes to be
            cancelled, as permitted by Rule 683.

CFJ 1283  "On or about Tue, 06 Mar 2001 16:04:06 -0800, Hoovooloo violated Rule
[FALSE]    1729."
          3/6     Called by Kelly
          3/8-18  Assigned to Murphy, who Judges FALSE
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Hooloovoo's attempt to Vote on
            Insane Proposal 4120 was ineffective (because it was not sent
            directly to the Assessor), so eir discussion of that attempt was
            not discussion of any actual Votes.

CFJ 1285  "Between the time of the creation of the "Enrich the Contestmaster"
[FALSE]    Contest and this CFJ, Syllepsis, Ziggy, and Steve each successfully
           lowered the number of Stems they possess by 50, thus paying the
           Entry Fee for the Contest and successfully increasing the number of
           Stems possessed by the "Enrich the Contestmaster" Contest (in the
           Contest Fund) by 150 (total)."
          3/19     Called by Goethe
          3/19-22  Assigned to Kelly, who Judges FALSE
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Rule 1539 is restrictive, not
            permissive.

CFJ 1286  "The Herald is required to bill Syllepsis the Zombie Transfer Tax
           of 0.1 Indulgences for transfering 1 Zombie to the Bank"
          3/27     Called by Syllepsis
          3/27     Improperly assigned to Crito, who was On Hold
          3/29-31  Assigned to Elysion, who proto-Judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Syllepsis attempted to create a
            Currency called Zombies, mint some units of it, and transfer one
            to the Bank.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  An entity does not change a Rule's
            referent merely by having the same name as the Rule's original
            referent.

CFJ 1287  "The message (as quoted above) Goethe sent titled "Contest
           announcement: Bardic Gatherings" failed to create a Contest."
          3/30  Called by Peekee
          3/31  Assigned to Tim
          Caller's argument (summary):  Goethe did not explicitly label eir
            message as an Application to Create an Organization.
