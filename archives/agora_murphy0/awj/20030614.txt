ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Shuffle, Stem, Boon, Fix" by Peekee - Proposal 4501 failed quorum 5/27 -
     Complacent Oligarchy - Proposal 4503 adopted 6/14
   Correct an errant reference to Stems in Rule 2042 (Team Wins) that was

     back to Stems by "Team Shuffling".

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Expunge Nomic Properties" by Maud
   The definition of "Nomic Property" is repealed.
   Rules 1274 (Definition of Indices) and 594 (Power and Proposals) are
     re-worded to avoid mentioning Nomic Properties.

"Third Time's the Charm, Part 1 of 3" by Murphy - Proposal 4504
   Legislate the legal fiction that Annabel and harvel/Maud were separate
     players (until January 1, 2003).

"Third Time's the Charm, Part 2 of 3" by Murphy - Proposal 4505
   Retroactively fix Agoran epochs to apply only to absolute durations (e.g.
     "during the same month") and not to relative durations (e.g. "within one
     month after").

"Third Time's the Charm, Part 3 of 3" by Murphy - Proposal 4507
   Retroactively avoid the use of mathematical definitions for terms whose
     primary definition is non-mathematical.

"Vote Collector for Offices Does Not Move" by Murphy
   If the office of ADoP changes hands during an election for office, then the
     position of Vote Collector for that election does not move with it.

"Will Do" by Sherlock - Proposal 4506
   An entity may destroy eir will by announcement.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"... und Zeit" by Maud
   "Day", "week", "month", "quarter", and "year" refer to durations aligned
     against whatever starting point is specified.
   A month beginning on (month=m, day=d) ends on (month=m+1, day=d) or, if
     that is a nonexistent date, (month=m+2, day=1).
   "Weekly", "monthly", "quarterly", and "yearly" refer to the durations
     currently defined as "Agoran epochs".


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

*** Rule 1567 causes ineligibility by request to expire after one month ***

CFJ 1449 "The Proposal entitled 'Full Discretion Fix' would have been
[TRUE]    Rubberstamped by the message sent by Cecilius today under the
Appealed  subject line 'Rubberstamping, Take Two,' if that Proposal had not
           already been Rubberstamped."
          Linked to CFJ 1448
          3/3     Called by Cecilius
          3/9-17  Assigned to Goethe, who Judges TRUE
          3/20    Appealed by Steve, Sir Toby, and Pakaran
          3/20    Appeal assigned to Steve, Eris, and Pakaran
          3/24    Steve moves to overturn and reverse
          3/31    Eris moves to overturn and remand
          Judge Steve's refutation (summary):  Transfers (even of 0)
            require a valid Notice of Transfer, and a Notice of Transfer
            for 0 cannot be valid.
          Commentary:  A Rubberstamped Proposal may be Rubberstamped again.

CFJ 1461 "One or more tax debts of one or more bouncy balls were created as
           a result of a message sent by root on May 27, 2003."
          5/26  Called by root
          6/5   Assigned to Eris
          Caller's argument (summary):  The first tax notice may have been
            invalid because it did not include "everyone else: zero" in the
            required list of currency holdings and tax debts.

CFJ ???? "Murphy is the vote collector in the election for Registrar."
          6/7  Called by Murphy
          Caller's argument (summary):  The title of vote collector may have
            moved with the office of ADoP, which changed hands during the
            nominating period.


OFFICES
-------

6/14  Registrar election fails quorum, or failed due to the Vote Collector
         not publishing a list of candidates in time, depending on who the
         Vote Collector is.  (See Murphy's CFJ of June 7.)


OLIGARCHS

IN OTHER NEWS
-------------

6/9   Maud comes Off Hold.

       Sir Toby becomes Abiding.

       Goethe submits a proto-ACO for the Contest "ACE of SPADES III":
         * Each contestant has a score based on eir hand of cards.
         * Each contestant may disapprove of a scoring regulation.  >50%
             disapproval makes a regulation ineffective.
         * The contestmaster may add new regulations, with or without
             revealing their text, with a three-day delay (to allow
             disapprovals) before (possibly) taking effect.
         * Each contestant may transfer cards, or agree to a contract of
             simultaneous transfer.  Anyone unable to satisfy a contract
             has a zero score until e satisfies it (or an alternate is
             agreed on).
       Initial scoring regulations:
         * Victor = 150+ points (and not tied for first) at Monday 23:59:00 
GMT.
         * Two red = 7 points.
         * Two green = 10 points.
         * Two black = 15 points.
         * [secret]
         * Three mauve = 25 points.
         * Fractional points truncated.
         * No Victor -> each contestant gets another card.

6/13  Maud submits a proto-ACO for a Contest to play Claustronomic, whose
         initial rules are substantially the same as Agora's initial rules
         (except for amendment numbers, weekly proposal batches, and
         different point awards).
