   While the Oligarchy is wholly vacant, all Proposals are Democratic.
   When an Ordinary Proposal is made Democratic, its Voting Period is
     extended to seven days after that change.

"Harsher Blot Penalties" by Elysion - Proposal 3990 adopted 3/29
     (Originally labelled Proposal 3988, but not actually distributed
      at that time.  Later distributed and labelled Proposal 3990.  See
      also "Agora Abhors a Vacuum".)
   Proposing rights are revoked at 5 (not 10) Blots.
   Voting rights are revoked at 3 (not 15) Blots.

REJECTED PROPOSALS

   ?

"Quick Minting When It Is Needed" by t - Proposal 3989 failed quorum 3/23
   ?

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Points Revisited" by t
   Points are no longer a Currency.

"Simplify Power" by harvel
   Rule 1688 (Power) is reworded in a simpler fashion.

"Urgency Must be Paid For" by Wes
   Urgent Proposals must still wait for the next Batch distribution
     unless they have the highest Priority in the Queue.

"Oligarchy Auctions 'in progress'" by Steve
   Oligarchy Auctions are deemed to be in progress until the positions are
     filled (by way of winning Bids being paid), or one week after all
     winning Bids were billed, whichever is first.  Winning Bids not paid
     within a week are vacated, a 2-Blot penalty is assessed, and a new
     Auction is conducted for that position.
   A Player may become an Oligarch while On Hold (but still ceases to be
     an Oligarch if e later goes On Hold).
   A Player becomes an Oligarch, even if someone else satisfies the
     Payment Order that would make em one.
   Only winning Bids count toward determining the price of Oligarchy.

"Please, Be Nice to the Payroll Clerk" by lee
   Repeal Trade Fellowships, which are mistakenly required to be paid
     out of the Payroll Clerk's pocket.  (This is not only undesirable,
     but actually impossible; they're paid in Stems, but Stems can't be
     transferred between Players.)

"Simplify 'ASAP'" by Steve
   Actions required to be done ASAP must be done within a week, or the
     Class 1 Infraction of Tardiness applies.  This period may be
     increased for Inactive Players.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Compensations" by harvel
   Add the New Player Award, Speaker's Gratuity, and Judicial Salary to the
     Budget.

"Freedom of the Ballot Box" by Murphy
   Repeal paying for Votes.  Each voting entity gets exactly one Vote on each
     Democratic Proposal.

"Freedom of the Press" by Murphy
   Repeal P-Notes, Proposal Priority, and the Proposal Queue.  All 
Proposals are
     distributed in the week after they are submitted.

"Nomic Entity Reform" by harvel
   "Nomic Entity" is removed from the Ruleset.

"Officer Reform" by harvel
   If an Office's duties include being the Recordkeepor of a Currency, then
     records for that Currency are part of that Office's Report.
   Monthly Reports are defined.

"Probate Yet Again" by Wes
   Wills are no longer SLCs.
   While the Executor of an entity in Probate, the Notary may only act as
     required by "Automatic Dispensation":
       1) Pay debts.
       2) Expunge Blots.
       3) Implement Will.
       4) Transfer Currency to Bank; vacate credits.
       5) Declare end of Probate.
   Rule 1757 (Implementation of Probate Plans) is repealed as redundant.

"Terms" by Wes
   "Fees" are defined.
   "Public" messages are defined.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1203 "The Auction for High Oligarch started on Monday, 06 Mar 2000 at
[TRUE]    23:40:31 -0800 has ended."
Appealed 3/15     Called by Blob
          3/15-17  Assigned to Peekee, who Judges TRUE
          3/18     Appealed by Oerjan, lee, and Blob
          3/18     Appeal assigned to Murphy, Anthony, and harvel
          3/22     harvel moves to overturn and reassign
          3/25     Anthony defaults
          3/27     Appeal position reassigned to Chuck
          Caller's argument (summary):  No winning Bids were made since
            harvel's winning Bid on 3/9, even though harvel retracted that
            Bid on 3/11.  Thus, the auction ended on 3/12.
          Justice harvel's refutation (summary):  Neither of Judge
            Peekee's stated reasons are sufficient to support eir verdict.
          Justice Murphy's refutation (summary):  Judge Peekee points out
            the lack of "hard evidence" to prove that Wes sent eir Bid at
            the time in question.  However, the preponderance of the
            evidence (Rule 1575) indicates that e *did* send eir Bid.

CFJ 1205 "Wes committed the Class 1 Crime of Promotor Misrepresentation
[TRUE]    when he distributed Proposal 3988 (Harsher Blot Penalties), on
           Thu, 16 Mar 2000 18:20:25 -0800"
          3/24     Called by Steve
          3/24-31  Assigned to elJefe, who Judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Proposal 3988's Priority was too low
