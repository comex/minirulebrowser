     Oligarchy - Proposal 4468 (03-53) adopted 3/17
   A Protege may award multiple Mentor's Bonuses, one per Player, totalling no
     more than the New Player Award.  (Previously, e could divide a Bonus among
     multiple Players, but the Bank did not explicitly incur debts to more than
     one Player.)

"Close the Tax Shelter" by Steve - Proposal 4470 adopted 3/27
   Rule 1917 (General Currency Taxation) is merged into 1853 (Levying Taxes).

   If the Indulgence Surplus is between zero and one, then the Herald may 
choose
     to Auction based on the Monthly Bank Indulgence Gain.  (Previously, e 
could
     only do so if the Surplus was zero or negative.)

"Q-Bert" by OscarMeyr - Proposal 4471 adopted 3/27
   Purple is a Land Type.
   Each week, Q*Bert hops in a random diagonal direction (unless it and another
     entity end the week at the same Location, in which case it hops in a 
random
     orthogonal direction).  It never reverses its previous direction.
   If Q*Bert would leave the Map, then it ceases to have a Location, and moves
     to (0,0) the next week.
   Q*Bert has a color (initially Purple).
   Q*Bert changes its destination's Type to match its color, unless they 
already
     match, in which case it changes its destination's Type to the Type with
     Sente.
   If Q*Bert has Sente, then its color becomes a random Land Type other than
     Aether or its old color.
   The Mapkeepor is Limited Executor of Q*Bert, and shall cause it to act as
     required.

"Quick Fix in R1929" by OscarMeyr - Proposal 4457 failed quorum 3/2 -
     Complacent Oligarchy - Proposal 4467 (03-52) adopted 3/17
   Points are awarded upon the first valid notification (not just "first
     notification", so an invalid notification doesn't prevent a subsequent
     valid notification from awarding the Points).

"Saner Thesis Committees" by Goethe - Proposal 4462 (03-41) adopted 3/17
   Players choose a Chair, who must consent.  For non-Players, or if no one

     and Committee dissolves.

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

"Heavy Weather" by Sherlock - Proposal 4469 (03-56) failed quorum 3/17 -
     Complacent Oligarchy - Proposal 4472 rejected 3/27
   Forecast is a Bank Currency switch with values Clear and Stormy.
   The Treasuror may flip any Forecast switch.
   All Stormy Currencies have Weather similar to Stems.  This is the only way
     the Bank may mint Bank Currencies.

     payment of the Entry Fee if the Contest does not have one.

"Default Budgets and Election Errors" by Steve - Proposal 4474 failed quorum
     4/7 (Complacent Oligarchy)
   Nominations without a Proto-Budget are automatically associated with one
     identical to the current Budget.  (If that is invalid, then the
     nomination is automatically withdrawn.)
   Election results are valid unless challenged within seven days.

"Fix Dereliction of Duty" by root
   Officers cited for Dereliction of Duty are removed, not retired.
   Blob is mauve.

"Fix PWIN" by Peekee - Proposal 4473 failed quorum 4/7 (Complacent Oligarchy)
   PWIN is set to 100.  This repairs part of Rule 1990 (Points Contests)
     that was accidentally broken when Teams were introduced.
   PPP is repealed.  (This would break a different part of Rule 1990.)

"More Useful Stem Weather" by OscarMeyr
   The destruction phase of Weather remains limited to the Bank's holdings,
     but the creation phase is no longer proportionally limited.

"Passing Milkthistle By" by Sherlock - Contested Proposal 4476

     are broken by the Scorekeepor's choice.

"Teams clean up" by Peekee - Proposal 4475
   Repeal Rule 112 (Ways to Win and Preclusions Thereof), since wins are
     now awarded to Teams rather than individual Players.

"Votes of No Confidence" by Sherlock - Proposal 4477
   Presence is repealed.
   A Vote of NO CONFIDENCE does not count toward Quorum.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

     Cheermeister, Ubercheermeister) for participants in Birthday Contests.

"Agora, Awaken!" by Sherlock
   Each eligible Player who fails to Vote commits the Class 1 Infraction
     of Failure to Vote.

"Captains" by Peekee
   Captains are Executors of eir Teams.
   A Player may become Captain of eir Captain-less Team without objection.
   Any player may remove eir Team's Captain by announcement.

"English, please" by root
   The official language of Agora is English.
   Sending untranslated non-English messages is the Class 3 Crime of
     Speaking in Tongues (but the messages are still effective, so long
     as they are unambiguous).

"Of what worth honor?" by Goethe
   Rubberstamping, absolution, and debate (changing the chamber of a
     proposal) are generalized into energetic actions, and made 1
     support/Currency more expensive.
   Each Player has a number of Kudos.  Fees are in kudos.
   Once a week, a Player may transfer a kudo from one Player to another
     (e cannot be the recipient), with reasons, provided e emself has
     at least one kudo.
   Patent Titles may be Ephemeral.
   Boons and Albatrosses are Ephemeral Patent Titles.
   Daffodills are generic Boons.
   Carcasses are generic Albatrosses.
   The Herald's Budget includes the Tabla Rasa, an integer between 5 and 25.
   Each quarter, each Player's kudos are set equal to the Tabla Rasa, plus
     the number of eir boons, minus the number of eir albatrosses; Agora's
     kudos are set equal to the Tabla Rasa times the number of players; and
     all Ephemeral Patent Titles are revoked.
   The Tabla Rasa is initially 5.
   Stems, Indulgences, VEs, Papyri, and Land are redeemed in Daffodils.
   Fees are in kudos.  Agora's kudos are increased by the fee.  If an action
     is attempted with insufficient kudos, and a Player's announcement of it
     is confirmed, then the recordkeepor must either (with support) announce
     that it did not occur, or (without 3 objections) announce that it did
     occur.  In the latter case, the Player pays what kudos e can, and receives
     albatrosses for the difference.
   New Players receive twice the Tabla Rasa.
   Mentors receive the Boon of Mentorship; the Protege receives the Boon of
     Politeness.
   Salaries, the Speaker's Gratuity, and the Distributor's Gratuity are 
replaced
     with Daffodils.
   Judicial Salaries are replaced with the Boon of Wisdom, and their revocation
     with the Albatross of Foolishness.
   Birthday gifts are replaced with the Boon of Celebration, and birthday
     contest awards with the Patent Title of Nth Anniversary Ribbon.
   Changing role early costs 2 or 6 kudos.
   Monks are repealed.
   Successful Rebels receive the Ephemeral Patent Title of Rebel Hero.
   The Indulgence tax for successful Rebellion is repealed.
   The GWotO's Budget contains the Oligarchy Charge Requirement (a positive
     integer less than 10, initially 6) and the Oligarchic Term (a number of
     days between 30 and 90, initially 60).
   Any Player may join the Oligarchy by paying the Charge Requirement (halved
     for Politicians), and buy additional terms for the same price.  E is
     removed after the end of eir term(s).
   Appointed Oligarchs get half a term.
   The Treasuror is merged into the Notary.
   Papyri are repealed.
   On Democratic Proposals, non-Oligarchs have a Voting Power of two plus eir
     Voting Potential; Oligarchs, one plus eir Voting Potential.
   Voting Potentials are zeroed monthly.  A Player may buy a Voting 
Potential of
     N (positive integer) by paying the Oligarchy Charge Requirement times N.
   Simplifying the Rules via repeal gains the Ephemeral Patent Title of
     Tapecutter.
   Proposal adoption during Grace Period gains the Ephemeral Patent Title of
     Prodigy.
   Embezzlement is repealed.
   Looting Auctions are repealed.
   Levying Taxes is repealed.
   Speaker's Patronage is replaced with the Ephemeral Patent Title of Gold 
Star.

"Oligarchs, Awaken!" by Sherlock
   When the Oligarchy is complacent, all non-Voting Oligarchs commit the
     Class 1 Infraction of Falling Asleep at the Wheel.

   A Team may have Points in addition to its members' Points.
   +10:  All members vote on a democratic proposal.

   +10:  All members vote FOR or AGAINST a democratic proposal.
   +10:  All members vote in an election.
   -10:  No members vote in an election.
   +10:  All members vote for same candidate in an election.
   +15:  Successful revolt while all members are rebels.
   -10:  Unsuccessful revolt while all members are rebels.
   + 4:  All members at same location in Arcadia, excluding the
           position from which the team last scored this way.

"Work Reform" by Sherlock
   The Speaker's Weekly Report includes the Duty Roster.
   Each Duty has a non-negative Salary, and may have a Player Assignee.
   The Speaker may, with 2 support, add or remove a Duty, or add or remove
     a Player from a Duty.
   The initial Duty Roster breaks the Office of Notary into Dissolutes,
     Organizations, and Wills.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

*** Rule 1567 causes ineligibility by request to expire after one month ***

CFJ 1438 "The Order issued by Steve,
           'I order the Bank to forgive RedKnight's Oligarchy upkeep debt.'
           (http://www.escribe.com/games/agora-business/m9000.html)

           is not a properly-issued Order."
          2/18      Called by Goethe
          2/18-3/2  Assigned to Sir Toby, who defaults
          3/9       Incorrectly assigned to Blob, who is Unready and thus
                      ineligible
          3/9-23    Assigned to Cecilius, who is recused
          3/31      Assigned to Pakaran
          Caller's argument (summary):  A Rule bug prevents the GWotO from
            obeying the first requirement of Rule 2010.  Issuing this Order is
            the second requirement of Rule 2010.  The Order is valid, but 
may be
            improper under the circumstances.

CFJ 1439 "Goethe has successfully absolved 1 Blot from emself this Agoran
[TRUE]    week."
          2/20       Called by Goethe
          2/25-3/10  Assigned to root, who Judges TRUE
          4/4-5      Appealed by Sir Toby and Eris
          Caller's argument (summary):  Prior to the CFJ, in the same message,
            Goethe said something which e claims is "I intend to absolve one of
            my Blots with 0 Support; I absolve one of my Blots with 0 Support"
            in a foreign language.  Prior to that, Goethe had not absolved any
            of eir Blots that week.
          Counterargument:  Non-English languages are not merely dialects.

CFJ 1446 "The Proposal 'Try Again, Part 1 of 3' is distributable."
          Linked to CFJ 1447
          3/2  Called by Murphy
          3/9-23    Assigned to Cecilius, who is recused
          3/31      Assigned to Blob
          Caller's argument (summary):  Murphy claimed to rubberstamp, without
            specifying a method.  Later, e claimed that e had done it by paying
            a Fee of 0 Papyri.  During the week in which e claimed to
            rubberstamp, e had not previously rubberstamped anything.

CFJ 1447 "The Proposal 'Try Again, Part 2 of 3' is distributable."
          Linked to CFJ 1446
          3/2  Called by Murphy
          3/9-23    Assigned to Cecilius, who is recused
          3/31      Assigned to Blob
          Caller's argument (summary):  Murphy claimed to rubberstamp by paying
            a Fee of 0 Papyri.  During the week in which e made this claim, e
            had not previously rubberstamped anything.

CFJ 1448 "The Proposal entitled 'Full Discretion Fix' was Rubberstamped by a
[FALSE]   message sent by Cecilius today under the subject line
           'Rubberstamping, Take Two'."
          Linked to CFJ 1449
          3/3     Called by Cecilius
          3/9-17  Assigned to Goethe, who Judges TRUE
          3/20    Appealed by Steve, Sir Toby, and Pakaran
          3/20    Appeal assigned to Steve, Eris, and Peekee
          3/24    Steve moves to overturn and reverse
          3/27    Peekee moves to overturn and reverse
          3/31    Eris moves to overturn and remand
          Judge Goethe's argument (summary):  Doing nothing counts as
            transferring 0 of a Currency, so doing nothing for the sole
            stated purpose of performing an action requiring a Fee of 0
            counts as paying the Fee.
          Judge Steve's refutation (summary):  Transfers (even of 0)
            require a valid Notice of Transfer, and a Notice of Transfer
            for 0 cannot be valid.

CFJ 1449 "The Proposal entitled 'Full Discretion Fix' would have been
[TRUE]    Rubberstamped by the message sent by Cecilius today under the
Appealed  subject line 'Rubberstamping, Take Two,' if that Proposal had not
           already been Rubberstamped."
          Linked to CFJ 1448
          3/3     Called by Cecilius
          3/9-17  Assigned to Goethe, who Judges TRUE
          3/20    Appealed by Steve, Sir Toby, and Pakaran
          3/20    Appeal assigned to Steve, Eris, and Pakaran
          3/24    Steve moves to overturn and reverse
          3/31    Eris moves to overturn and remand
          Judge Steve's refutation (summary):  Transfers (even of 0)
            require a valid Notice of Transfer, and a Notice of Transfer
            for 0 cannot be valid.
          Commentary:  A Rubberstamped Proposal may be Rubberstamped again.

CFJ 1451 "Peekee has published a message containing the text 'MessageXX', in
[TRUE]    emails with titles 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9."
          Linked to CFJ 1452
          3/6     Called by Peekee
          3/9-17  Assigned to root, who Judges TRUE
          Commentary:  This CFJ is intended to determine whether a message can
            span multiple e-mail messages, as specified by a later message.

CFJ 1452 "Peekee has published a message containing the text 'This is a single
[TRUE]    message', in emails with titles A and B."
          Linked to CFJ 1451
          3/6     Called by Peekee
          3/9-17  Assigned to root, who Judges TRUE
          Commentary:  This CFJ is intended to determine whether a message can
            span multiple e-mail messages, as specified by a later message.

CFJ 1453 "As a result of the formation of root's Pay Out Scam Contest (rPOSC),
[TRUE]    the Bank incurred a debt to root consisting of one or more
           properties."
          3/4      Called by root
          3/10-17  Assigned to t, who makes emself ineligible
          3/20-24  Assigned to Sir Toby, who Judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  The Contest required root to pay out
            Property to emself, and Rule 1594 (Violation of SLCs) requires em
            to obey the Regulations.  Since Rule 1594 requires em to pay out
            Property, Rule 1479 (Definition of "Pay Out" and "Bill") causes the
            Bank to incur a debt.
          Judge's argument (summary):  This is backed up by game custom that
            Orders requiring paying-out create debts because they are also
            backed by Rule 1594.

CFJ 1454 "New York is the capital of England."
DISMISS  3/9      Called by Peekee
          3/20-24  Assigned to Michael, who Judges DISMISS
          Caller's argument (summary):  This CFJ is intended to test (a) 
whether
            an arbitrary statement becomes relevant to the Rules simply because
            it is CFJed, and (b) whether this particular statement becomes
            relevant to the Rules because of its role in (a).
          Judge's argument (summary):  A statement is not necessarily relevant
            to a nomic's rules just because it is relevant to the nomic (a 
nomic
            consists of more than its rules), or because it causes the rules to
            be consulted and obeyed.

CFJ 1455 "Sir Toby did not join The Evil Scam Contest in a message sent to
[TRUE]    agora-business on Fri, 14 Mar 2003 08:53:40 -0800, with the
           following subject: This message brought to you by the letter 'a'."
          3/14     Called by Sir Toby
          3/20-27  Assigned to Steve, who Judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  The Regulations of The Evil Scam 
Contest
            deem messages containing the letter 'a' to be requests to join, but
            this did not apply to Sir Toby because e was a non-Contestant and
            thus outside the jurisdiction of the Regulations.
          Judge's argument (summary):  Rule 1612 prohibits involuntary
            membership in an Organization, and Sir Toby did not clearly
            volunteer.
          Commentary:  The Regulations apply to Sir Toby with respect to
            joining, just as the Rules apply to non-Players with respect to
            registering.  Rule 1539 only permits the Regulations to impose
            additional restrictions, not additional methods, but Rule 1539 does
            not say that the Regulations may only do what it specifies.  Rule
            1592 restricts the Regulations to changing properties defined by
            them, or properties that the Rules permit them to change, but
            membership falls into one category or the other.

CFJ 1456 "If a Contest does not specify a quantity of some particular Currency
[TRUE]    as an Entry Fee, then a player is not required to pay a Fee (as in
           Rule 1941) to join that Contest."
          Linked to CFJs 1457, 1458, 1459

CFJ 1458 "If a Contest has no Entry Fee or does not specify an Entry Fee, then
[TRUE]    players may join that Contest without paying an Entry Fee.

CFJ 1459 "If a Contest has no Entry Fee or does not specify an Entry Fee, then
[TRUE]    players are considered to have paid the Entry Fee without having to
           make a statement specifically to pay the Entry Fee.

           for at least one Officer to act as soon as possible [after the
           message]."
          4/4  Called by Goethe
          Commentary:  The message in question was written in Turkish.
