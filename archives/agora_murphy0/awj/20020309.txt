  An "epoch" is a week, month, quarter, or year.

    otherwise be vacant, then the Office is vacant.
  Resigning Officer's successor has one week to consent.
  Resigning Oligarch's successor has one week to consent, and must pay 1 VE.
  The current Cabinet becomes the Inner Cabinet.  The Outer Cabinet consists of
    all Oligarchs who are not part of the Inner Cabinet.
  The Speaker shall announce when a Player becomes marvy.
  Members of the Outer Cabinet are marvy.
  An Officer who commits Failure to Report three weeks in a row may be cited
    for either Failure to Report or Dereliction of Duty, but not both.
  Rules defining Offices are conformed to this template:
    "The _____ is an office; its holder is recordkeepor of/for _____ and is
     responsible for _____.
    "The _____'s Weekly/Monthly Report shall include _____.
    "The _____ shall have a budget containing _____.   The _____ may <dependent

     announces eir intent to do so."

  Once a week, an Acolyte with the Support of another Acolyte may expunge 1
    Blot from any entity.
  An Acolyte with the Support of a Scribe, or vice versa, may Bless an
    Undistributed Proposal; it becomes Democratic upon Distribution.
  A Politician with the support of another Politician may Unbless a Proposal.
  An Untainted Speaker with 2 Supporters may Sanitise a Proposal in its Voting
    Period; it is Aborted, but remains Distributable, and becomes Democratic
    and Sane.

"Regular VE Auctions, sooner" by Steve - Proposal 4255 - Adopted 2/21
  The Assessor's Budget sets the Voting Entitlements per Player (VEPP), a
    multiple of 0.1 from 0.5 to 2.0, initially 1.5.  A monthly VE Auction
    occurs if non-Bank VE holdings are less than the VEPP times the number of
    Players.

"Simplify Identity of Auctioneer" by Murphy - Proposal 4240 - Complacent
    Oligarchy - Proposal 4249 - Adopted 2/18
  Auctioneer defaults to Player initiating Auction, rather than Speaker.
  Clauses made redundant by this change are eliminated.

"Single-Bid Auctions" by Steve - Proposal 4251 - Adopted 2/18

    Inflation Factor, a real number from 0 to 1.

    of the Bid.

"Streamline Referendum and Election Voting" by Murphy - Proposal 4257 - Adopted
    2/21
  Some clauses are made more terse.
  Some clauses are moved around.
  Identity of Vote Collector is fixed at beginning of Referendum.
  Formal definition of "Voter", "Prospective", and "Nominator".
  Cutoff for Challenges moved from Election procedure to Referendum procedure
    (since the Voting portion of an Election is a sub-class of Referendum).
  Elections may be Selfish (default; Nominate only yourself), Selfless
    (Nominate anyone but yourself), or Open (Nominate anyone), at the Vote
    Collector's discretion.

"Win Differently" by Goethe - Proposal 4245 - Complacent Oligarchy - Proposal
    4253 - Adopted 2/18
  A Champion's Contest is a Contest whose Regulations say so, and whose
    Contestmaster is the Current Champion.
  The Contestmaster of a Champion's Contest may announce that a Contestant is a
    SemiGenius, thus Winning the Game.  The announcement must be explicitly
    permitted by the Regulations.
  A Player who Wins in this way receives a Winner's Stipend equal to the ratio
    (rounded to the nearest 0.1) of Active Contestants in the Champion's
    Contest to Active Players, times the Basic Officer Salary.
  A Contestmaster who announces a Winner in this way receives a Champion's
    Pension equal to the Winner's Stipend.
  At the beginning of the month, if the Current Champion was Champion
    continuously for the previous four months, then e is billed twice the
    Winner's Stipend.

Unnamed Proposal by root - Proposal 4259 - Adopted 2/21
  Responsibility for tracking the identity of the Speaker is taken away from
    the Registrar and Assistant Director of Personnel, and is given solely to

"Contestant's Purse" by Goethe - Proposal 4244 - Complacent Oligarchy -
    Proposal 4252 - Rejected 2/18
  The Contestant's Purse (equal to the New Player Award for Indulgences and
    Papyri combined) is paid out monthly to the Player who got the most Points
    from Points Contests during the previous month.  (In case of ties, no one
    gets it.)

"Free Fees just for Visiting" by Goethe - Proposal 4243 - Rejected 2/8
  An action with a Fee may be performed without the Fee if the Player's
    Location is the same as the Location of the Rule specifying the Fee, and
    e announces this when e performs the action.

"Shut Up!" by neil - Proposal 4242 - opposite of Proposal 4239 - Rejected 1/28

  The Fee for non-Speaker Attempts to Democratise is reduced from 0.1 VEs to
    0.01 VEs.

"Fix Bonus for Repeal" by harvel
  The erroneous text "part of all" in Rule 947 (Bonus for Repeal) is replaced.

"Fix 'Oligarchy Upkeep'" by Steve
  If an Oligarch is removed for failure to pay eir Upkeep, then the Upkeep debt
    is forgiven.

"Fix Proposal 4259" by root
  Punctuation correction in Rule 1975.
  Remove the obsolete concept of Elder Oligarchs from Rules 1955 (The Grand
    Warden of the Oligarchy) and 2010 (Oligarchy Upkeep).
  Put the identity of the Speaker and the date of the next quarterly Speaker
    Transition back into the GWotO's Report.

"Fix Raffles" by Steve - Proposal 4265
  The Riff-Raff is the Auctioneer, rather than defaulting to the Speaker.  (The
    Auctioneer already defaults to the Speaker.)
  The definition of Final Auction Price for a Raffle is repealed, as it has no
    effect.

"Fluid Dynamics" by neil
  Stems are freely transferrable.
  If a Player correctly announces that Bonds have not been used for two months,
    then all Bonds are accelerated and destroyed, and the Bond Rules are
    repealed.

"MAKE INSANITY MORE FUN" by neil
  A Player's Votes on an Insane Proposal must be all the same (i.e. all FOR,
    all AGAINST, or all ABSTAIN).

"Mutually Exclusive Offices" by Murphy
  Responsibility for tracking the identity of the Speaker is given solely to
    the Assistant Director of Personnel.
  The Order of Succession is generalized to fill any Office that would not
    otherwise be validly filled.
  A Player is ineligible to hold an Office that is Mutually Exclusive with an
    Office e already holds.  If needed, e is removed from the conflicting
    Office e came to hold most recently.  The Speaker is removed from any
    Office that is Mutually Exclusive with Speaker-Elect.
  Speaker-Elect, Clerk of the Courts, and Justiciar are Mutually Exclusive.
  Speaker-Elect and Assistant Director of Personnel are Mutually Exclusive.
  Promotor and Assessor are Mutually Exclusive.

"Omnibus Simple Fix Proposal of 2002" by Murphy
  Grammar corrections in Rules 1449, 1840, and 1990.
  Remove the obsolete concept of Elder Oligarchs from Rules 1955 (The Grand
    Warden of the Oligarchy) and 2010 (Oligarchy Upkeep).

"Simplify TIA" by Murphy
  The definition of "willfully make a false statement of fact" is itemized.

"Streamline Blots" by Murphy
  Move the definition of Blots into its own Rule, with more streamlined
    language - a Player's number of Blots is eir Stain, just as eir number of
    Points is eir Score.  (This would incidentally destroy all Blots, as they
    would be momentarily undefined.)
  Move the clause for expunging Blots with Indulgences into its own Rule.

"Streamline Succession and Delegation" by Murphy
  Resignation is itemized into two cases:  (1) Electee resigns with successor;
    (2) non-Electee resigns, or Electee resigns without successor.
  Initiating Delegation is consistently itemized.  Other aspects of Delegation
    are consistently described with simple two- or three-clause paragraphs.

"The Jailor" by Murphy
  The Office of Jailor has a Budget that sets the Class of each Crime and
    Infraction.
  The Class of a Crime is from 0 to 15.
  The Class of an Infraction is from 0 to 5.
  Dereliction of Duty may be penalized as if it were a Crime.

"The Scorekeepor's Budget" by root
  The Scorekeepor's Budget contains:
    * The Goal, an integer from 30 to 300.
    * A Point Award or Penalty for each Scoreworthy Event.
    * Up to five Point Awards or Penalties for non-Scoreworthy Events.
    * The Contestant's Purse Frequency, an integer from 1 to 6.  The
        Contestant's Purse is paid out at intervals of this many months.
    * The Contestant's Purse Multiplier, a multiple of 0.1 from 0.5 to 2.0.
        The Contestant's Purse equals the New Player Award for Indulgences and
        Papyri combined, multiplied by the Contestant's Purse Multiplier.
  All Point Awards and Penalties are integers from 0 to 30, with an average no
    greater than 10.  The Budget must contain at least one Point Award.
  The Contestant's Purse is paid out to the Player who got the most Points from
    Points Contests from the beginning of the previous Contestant's Purse Month
    to the beginning of the current Contestant's Purse Month.  (In case of
    ties, no one gets it.)

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Cold Storage" by harvel
  A Player may put emself in cold storage, making em a "baridi".  The Treasuror
    becomes eir Limited Executor, with the ability and duty to transfer eir
    Property to the Bank; the Bank then owes those Properties to em.
  A Player must wait 90 days to come out of cold storage and become inactive,
    and an additional week to become active.
  A baridi may not Vote, Propose, hold Office, or be required by the Rules to
    do anything (even by a Rule claiming it can do so).
  A baridi becomes Silent after two years.
  For the purpose of Quorum, a baridi is considered not to exist at all.
  Various other Rules pertaining to Activity are adjusted to account for a
    three-state system.

"Dissolving Parliament" by Murphy
  Repeal Rule 1980 (Becoming Parliamentary).

"Encourage Use of Scribes' Council" by Murphy

    of that Office announced eir intent to perform.

  Grammar correction.

"Fix Rule 1990" by Murphy

"Fix Rule 955" by Murphy
  Rule 955's requirement of at least three Votes FOR is explicitly attached to
    the clause (Voting Index and Adoption Index both equal Unanimity).

"Land Simplification" by Goethe
  The Mapkeepor shall give each Rule a new location within the grid formed by
    (-12, -12) and (12, 12), such that no two Rules have the same new location,
    and only Rules previously at a location owned by the Land Bureau are moved
    to locations not owned by the Land Bureau.  Land type and sub-type move
    with the Rule.  If the new location was owned by the Land Bureau before,
    then it becomes owned by the owner of the Rule's previous location.
  When the Mapkeepor publishes this Notice of Upheaval, then Rule 1993 (The
    Land of Arcadia) is amended to restrict locations to the new grid, and the
    Mapkeepor gets an extra month's Salary.
  The Mapkeepor may assign new Rules to any location that is not already the
    location of a Rule.

"Logan's Run" by Murphy
  Repeal the no-longer-used term "Elder Oligarch".

"Qualified Speaker's Veto" by Steve
  The Speaker may, with the support of one-third of the Oligarchy (rounded
    down), Veto an Ordinary Proposal in its Voting Period, causing it to fail
    Quorum automatically (and thus be re-Distributed as a Democratic Proposal).

"Simplify New Player Award" by Murphy
  The New Player Award is paid out by the Registrar, not the Treasuror.

"Simplify Rule 105" by Murphy
  Simplified by including the text of a Rule as "a substantive property of a
    Rule".

"Streamline Monkhood" by Murphy
  Grammar corrections and reordering of clauses.
  The ability of Monks to make a Proposal Distributable at lower cost is moved
    from Rule 1952 (Making Proposals Distributable) to Rule 1992 (Monks).

"The Speaker's Veto" by Murphy
  The Speaker may Veto an Ordinary Proposal in its Voting Period, causing it to
    fail Quorum automatically (and thus be re-Distributed as a Democratic
    Proposal).

"The Sundering" by Goethe
  Current Land owners will have some way (not yet written) to acquire new Land.
  All Land becomes owned by the Land Bureau.
  The grid is contracted from (-25, -25) - (25,25) to (-9, -9) - (9, 9).
  All Land types except Aether are repealed.  (All Land becomes Aether.)
  New Land types of Black and White are defined.

  A Player may pay 50 Stems to change an adjacent unit owned by the Land Bureau
    into Black or White, or change a unit of Land e owns from Black to White or
    vice versa.
  On the 15th of each month, any Units of Black or White that are not connected
    by their Land type to a Unit adjacent to Aether become Aether.
  The Mapkeepor shall assign a new location to each Rule such that no two Rules
    have the same location, Rule 101 is at (0, 0), and each Rule is adjacent to
    at least one other Rule of the same Category.  E shall then randomly
    determine whether each such location is Black or White.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT

           still Electee to Speaker-Elect and now its holder as well.  neil
           continued to hold this Office until the Speaker Transition on
           January 10.
         Judge's refutation (summary):  CFJ 1335 was Judged TRUE on grounds
           other than the identity of the Speaker.  The Judgement proceeds
           directly from that of CFJ 1335.

CFJ 1340 "At the time of the Speaker Transition occurring at 01:27:48 on 10

         1/10      Called by neil
         1/30-2/1  Assigned to Crito, who Judges TRUE
         Caller's argument (summary):  CFJ 1335 was based on an incorrect
           determination of the identity of the Speaker.  On December 8, a
           correct Notice of Speaker Transition made Steve Speaker, with neil
           still Electee to Speaker-Elect and now its holder as well.  neil
           continued to be Electee until the Speaker Transition on January 10.
         Judge's refutation (summary):  CFJ 1335 was Judged TRUE on grounds
           other than the identity of the Speaker.  The Judgement proceeds
           directly from that of CFJ 1335.

CFJ 1341 "neil committed the Crime of Misrepresentation in the message
[FALSE]   with Message-ID <15422.32050.200019.402505@tarski.2y.net>."
         1/11      Called by Murphy
         1/30-2/6  Assigned to Goethe, who Judges FALSE
         Caller's argument (summary):  neil publically stated "Read the Ruleset
           Week will be in January this year!"
         Judge's refutation:  neil made the statement as a joke, and did not
           present it as if it were true.

CFJ 1342 "If an Election ends in the middle of its Voting Period because
          there remains only a single Candidate, then the winner may be
          Awarded Points for winning a contested Election."
         1/22     Called by Murphy

CFJ 1343 "The Payroll Clerk may pay out 50 Stems to Neil for Neil's
[TRUE]    holding of the Promoter Office in January 2002."
         2/1     Called by Goethe
         2/7-13  Assigned to Crito, who Judges TRUE
         Caller's argument (summary):  The Payroll Clerk is required to pay out
           the Promotor's Salary "ASAP after the beginning of each month" (Rule
           1940).  The Promotor's Salary was increased from 0 to 50 Stems after
           the beginning of the month, but before it was actually paid out.
         Judge's argument (summary):  The amount of the Salary is determined at
           the time it is paid out.

CFJ 1344 "Proposal 4243 was adopted."
[FALSE]  2/11  Called by root
         2/14  Assigned to Steve, who Judges FALSE
         Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 955's requirement of at least three
           FOR Votes is a sub-clause of the condition that the Proposal's
           Adoption Index and Voting Index are both Unanimity.
         Judge's refutation (summary):  Precedent was set by the failure of
           Proposal 4067.  Also, the requirement of at least three FOR Votes
           was intended to apply to all Proposals, not just the few (if any)
           with an Adoption Index of Unanimity.
