ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

  Patent Titles are awarded by the Herald, rather than the Herald reporting
    Platonic awards.
  Duplicate Unique Patent Titles are revoked by the Herald.

"Clean up the ADoP's Title" by OscarMeyr - Proposal 4822 adopted 7/17
  Update Rule 1686 (Official Reports) to reflect the general renaming of
    "Assistant Director of Personnel" to "Associate Director of Personnel".

"Complacency Kills Proposals" by Goethe - Proposal 4817 adopted 7/10

    Ordinary Proposals.

"Dud Raffle" by Goethe - Proposal 4818 adopted 7/10
  Repeal Raffle Tickets, replacing existing copies with Duds.

"Feexin' Feexins" by root and - Proposal 4819 adopted 7/10
  Players performing an action with a fee of zero need not announce the fee.

  Move the card element Grafty from the rules to the Twopower Cardbook.

"Minor Switch Fix" by root - Proposal 4823 adopted 7/17
  When a switch state is removed, any entities in that state simply come to be
    in the switch's default state, rather than being flipped to it.

"Omnibus Spelling Fix" by Maud - Proposal 4825 adopted 7/17
  "nonwithstanding" -> "notwithstanding":
    2059 (Legality of Bonus Clauses)
    2078 (Takeover Proposals)

  Quietness is merged into inactivity.  A player may (with support and without
    2 objections) make another player inactive, if they have not posted in 30

    into it.
  Witch Hunts do not remove non-electees.
  Repeal Rule 2098 (May Day).

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Card Fixins" by root - Proposal 4834
  Site Gamblers are generalized, including the Deck, Discard Pile, Library,
    and now the Table.
  Cards are transferred to the Table while they take effect, discarded
    afterward (unless Persistent).
  Indications, Impositions, and Feats are explicitly defined as components
    of card exploits.  Individual cards may override their default mechanisms.

"Condense ratification" by Maud - Proposal 4832
  Merge ratification into a single rule, simplify "not subject to COE/CFJ"
    to "not in dispute", and allow non-required documents to be ratified.

"Let my people know" by Quazie
  The Short Logical Ruleset shall indicate how many rules it contains.

"Move your ors" by Goethe
  Remove superfluous commas and an "or" from Rule 698 (Always an Eligible
    Judge).

"Rulebooks" by Maud - Proposal 4831
  Rulebooks may define terms, enable, require, and regulate their own
    amendment, but cannot affect amendment of the Rules.
  Rulebooks have default Power 1, and (if non-blank) their maintainers shall
     publish them monthly and ASAP after changes.
  The Codex is a Rulebook with Power 3:

    List of Rulebooks.  The Codex is maintained by the Rules Lawyer.

"Speaker Reforms" by Goethe
  Proposals are once again ordinary by default.
  The Speaker may make undistributed proposals democratic for free, and may
    veto distributed ordinary proposals without needing support (increasing
    their Adoption Index by 1).
  Cardinals are continuously defined.
  Pope selection uses the mechanisms of Agoran decisions, rather than a
    custom nominate-and-support system.
  Finish repealing Speaker Taint.
  New card Debate-o-Matic (Common, initial quota 6; change a proposal's
    chamber).

"Step right up" by Maud
  When a player becomes active, e becomes eligible to vote on any Agoran
    decision on which e would have been eligible at the start if active.

"Tension makes a tangle" by Maud - Proposal 4833
  Regulated activities (which Rule 101, renamed "Agora May I?", allows players
    to perform only as specified) are activities that are prohibited, are
    allowed if a condition holds, would modify records required to be kept,
    would break Agora's Nomic-ness, or have been judicially declared as
    regulated.
  Repeal the leftover mention of the Initial Ruleset.
  Players may not be required to do what they are not empowered to do, and
    failing to do such actions is still never a crime or infraction.
  A set of events in a message with ambiguous order and thus effect may be
    invalidated without invalidating other events in the same message with
    unambiguous order and effect.
  Merge the rules for registration and deregistration.
  Simplify the language of Rule 478 (Fora).

    playing copies of that card, until they discard a copy of that card, at

"Ecumenical Proposals" by Maud
  The Envoy shall maintain a Buddy List (Rulebook) of friendly nomics and
    their members.  E may add nomics; any player may remove a nomic with 3

  Move the definition of Library from Rule 2089 (Gardner Library) to Rule
    2086 (The University of Agora).

CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

Requests for ineligibility:

<none>

CFJ 1453  "As a result of the formation of root's Pay Out Scam Contest (rPOSC),
[TRUE]     the Bank incurred a debt to root consisting of one or more
Appealed    properties."
           3/4/03    Called by root
           3/10-17   Assigned to t, who makes emself ineligible
           3/20-24   Assigned to Sir Toby, who Judges TRUE
           6/16/05   Appealed by root, Maud, and Goethe
           6/19-7/4  Appeal assigned to Murphy, Maud, and Michael, who are
                       recused
           7/8       Appeal assigned to Riail, Manu, and OscarMeyr
           Caller's argument (summary):  The Contest required root to pay out
             Property to emself, and Rule 1594 (Violation of SLCs) requires em
             to obey the Regulations.  Since Rule 1594 requires em to pay out
             Property, Rule 1479 (Definition of "Pay Out" and "Bill") causes
             the Bank to incur a debt.
           Judge's argument (summary):  This is backed up by game custom that
             Orders requiring paying-out create debts because they are also
             backed by Rule 1594.
           Counterargument (summary):  SLCs and similar entities do not
             empower in the same way that they restrict.  This appeal will
             provide an analogy for Cardbooks, Contracts, and Agreements.

CFJ 1573  "OscarMeyr became Speaker on or about 22:58:35 on 30 June 2005."
[FALSE]   7/4     Called by Maud
          7/8-11  Assigned to Goethe, who judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  The relevant result-of-conclave
            announcement was incorrect, but still effective.  OscarMeyr
            became pope (even though e was not a cardinal) and then Speaker
            (before eir non-cardinality made em a non-pope).
          Judge's refutation (summary):  The pope-making process explicitly
            depends on the ADoP choosing a cardinal.

CFJ 1574  "All Cards currently defined in the Onepower Cardbook that change
           Kudos (other than fees) are invalid and have no effect."
          7/28  Called by Manu
          Caller's argument (summary):  Such cards are neither the rules nor
            an instrument with Power >= 2.

        is discarded).  Maud supports the intention.
