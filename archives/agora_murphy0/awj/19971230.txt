     THE AGORAN WEEKLY JOURNAL
     VOLUME 42, ISSUE 13
     Tuesday edition
     December 30, 1997


PROPOSALS
---------

12/21  Murphy re-protoes "Plots".

12/22  Steve re-protoes "Bring Back Public Voting", which would make
         the Public Voting Experiment permanent.

       General Chaos protoes the beginnings of a Judicial Reform, which
         would define Sentencing Orders (Judicial Orders) and Notices
         of Infraction (Administrative Orders) as punishment for Crimes
         and Infractions.

12/23  Steve re-protoes "Bring Back Public Voting".

       General Chaos reprotoes eir Judicial Reform.

       Morendil cancels both eir Votes on Proposal 3640 ("FULL FRONTAL
         LOBOTOMY"), calling into question (twice) whether the Insanity
         Rule's clauses apply to cancelled Votes.

12/24  The Repeal-O-Matic generates Proposals to repeal the following
         Rules:

         * 1494 (Establish the Welcome Wagon)
         * 1741 (Restore Game Balance II)

       Promotor Crito attempted to generate additional Repeal-O-Matic
         Proposals to repeal the following Rules:

         * 1079 (Definition of "Random")
         * 1623 (Disinterested Proposals)
         * 1567 (Making Oneself Ineligible to Judge a CFJ)
         * 1661 (The Right of Patronage)

       but the Repeal-O-Matic Rule did not yet exist during the weeks
         corresponding to these supposed-Proposals.  Possible
         interpretations of this are:

         1) They were not Proposed at all.  [Promotor Crito insists
              that this is the case.]
         2) They were Proposed by Promotor Crito.
         3) They were Proposed by the Repeal-O-Matic Rule (through its
              Executor, Promotor Crito), even though the Repeal-O-Matic
              Rule did not mandate their being Proposed.

       General Chaos reprotoes "The Omnibus Reform Act of 1998", now
         also defining Appelate Orders and Private Orders, and (as
         promised) subsuming Transfer Orders and Payment Orders.

12/27  General Chaos reprotoes "TORAo1998".

12/28  General Chaos reprotoes "TORAo1998".

12/29  Steve Proposes "Bring Back Public Voting".

       Proposals 3603, 3618, 3619, and 3622 were not adopted after all.

       Voting ends on Proposals 3624-3649.  The following are adopted:
         3627 [G. Chaos] Pragmatization of Transfer Orders
         3628 [Murphy]   Fix Nominations
         3629 [G. Chaos] Persistent Judges
         3631 [Steve]    Left In A Huff!
         3633 [Chuck]    Repeal Rule Attributions
         3634 [Steve]    Permanent Public Voting
         3635 [G. Chaos] Simplify Judicial Salaries
         3636 [G. Chaos] Probate, Take Two
         3637 [Blob]     Perpetual Offices
         3638 [Michael]  Repeal the Virus
         3641 [Kolja A.] (Promotor may modify Repeal-O-Matic's Proposals)
         3642 [G. Chaos] No Double Penalties for Officers
         3643 [G. Chaos] Lowered Quorum
         3644 [G. Chaos] Liberalize Speaker's Patronage
         3645 [elJefe]   Late Judgements
         3646 [elJefe]   Organizational Payment Orders
         3647 [Swann]    Quorum Tools

       Proposal 3640 (FULL FRONTAL LOBOTOMY) fails to give Harlequin a
         Win, as Crito Voted FOR it.

12/30  Steve protoes "Curb VT Supply", which would turn off the weekly
         VT stipend when there are 200 or more VTs outside the Bank.


OFFICES
-------

12/29  Michael resigns as Assessor, appointing General Chaos, who
         accepts.


INTERNOMIC
----------

12/24  INP 355 (PlayNomic) is rejected.

12/28  Ambassador Kolja A. submits INP 357 to re-add "New Rishonnomic"
         to the list of voting members of InterNomic.

       INP 356 received no votes, the effect of which is undefined.
         (Ackanomic may have voted for it, but the formal record has
         apparently been lost.)

       InterNomic defaults on SFJ 10, the effect of which is undefined.


OTHER
-----

12/23  Steve joins "Chain Letter 1" and designates Oerjan and Kolja as
         eir nominees.

       Harlequin joins "Chain Letter 1" and designates Morendil and
         General Chaos as eir nominees.

       Crito joins "Chain Letter 1" and designates Michael and Swann
         as eir nominees.  Murphy gets 2 VTs because eir nominees have
         both become Contestants.

       "Standard Classes of Crimes" and "Deregistration due to Silence"
         are Infected by the Virus.  The former Infection causes all
         Crimes and Infractions to be without penalty, except for those
         with effects not defined using the Standard Classes.  My, but
         there are quite a few such Crimes and Infractions!

         * Allowing Excess CFJing
         * Dereliction of Duty
         * Excess CFJing
         * Excess Proposing
         * Failing to Judge
         * Failing to Judge an Appeal
         * Judge Inactivity
         * Misappropriation
         * Persistent Indebtedness
         * Seriousness
         * Speaker Abandonment
         * Wrongful Injunction

12/24  "The Church of Odo on the Worm Hole" (an Ackanomic organization)
         becomes a non-voting member of InterNomic.


Remaining choices for "Chain Letter 1" nominees:  Andre, Blob, Chuck, Vir
