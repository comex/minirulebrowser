  Making another Player Quiet is limited to once every 24 hours.

"Fix Rule 1585" by harvel - Proposal 4135 adopted 4/1

  The order of events when deregistering a Lawless Player is clarified.

"Fix the Rule that Never Ends" by harvel - Proposal 4137 adopted 4/1

"Various Minor Changes" by harvel - Proposal 4134 adopted 4/1

    "Vivification Due to Noise") are simplified by removing redundant language.

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Ambiguous Ordering Fix" by Elysion
  An attempt to make multiple simultaneous communications, not explicitly
    ordered, fails if any two specific orderings would result in substantively
    different gamestates.

"Bank Loans" by Blob - Proposal 4144
  The Bank may buy Bonds for Stems, at rates specified in the Usuror's Budget
    and dependent on the face value and time-to-maturity of the Bonds.
  The Credit Limit is an amount of Stems from 0 to 1000.  No Player may sell
    Bonds to the Bank equivalent to more than this amount of Stems.
  The Treasuror may, With Support, stop or start the Bank from buying Bonds.

"Becoming Parliamentary" by Goethe - Proposal 4146
  A Group may become Parliamentary if at least two members are not in eir Grace
    Periods, and
      (a) It has existed continuously for at least one month, and has Voted on
          at least one Democratic Proposal; or
      (b) It was formed before May 1, 2001.
  This is a supplement to "Better Democracy Through Groups"; see below.

"Better Democracy Through Groups" by Goethe
  A Group may become Parliamentary by announcement of its Vizier if:
      (1) It has existed continuously since March 21, 2001;
      (2) It has existed continuously for at least two months, and has Voted on
          at least one Democratic Proposal; or
      (3) With Support from a majority of the Viziers of all Parliamentary
          Groups.
  The Voting Power on Democratic Proposals of a P-Group with at least three
    members is twice the number of members plus the number of VEs it has,
    maximum sixteen.

"Even More Better Groups" by Goethe
  A clean merge of "Becoming Parliamentary" into "Better Groups".

"Fix insane bidding wars" by Ian
  This is a supplement to "The Speaker, Sanity and insane bidding wars"; see
    below.
  "Contested" is renamed to "Attacked".
  Lists of conditions and effects are expressed in convenient list form.

"Fix Rule 1470" by Kelly
  The Bank may transfer Property when not specifically authorized to do so by
    the Rules; however, the recipient owes their return to the Bank.

"Mentor's Bonus" by Blob - Proposal 4143
  During the four weeks after the end of a Player's Grace Period, the Player
    (if not a Zombie) may award a Mentor's Bonus to one other Player.

"The Scribe's Council" by Kelly
  A Player may make a Proposal Distributable for free, with the Support of a
    majority of all Scribes.

"The Speaker, Sanity and insane bidding wars" by Ian - Proposal 4145
  The Speaker may only make Interested, non-Contested Proposals Democratic.
  Proposals made Democratic by the Speaker are also made Sane, and the
    Distribution Cost is increased accordingly.  For the change to be made
    during the Voting Period, someone must first pay the difference in
    Distribution Cost.
  A Player may, With 3 Supporters, Contest a Proposal that could be made
    Democratic by the Speaker.  Doing so costs 0.1 VE.
  Players may pay VEs for or against a Contested Proposal.  At the end of the
    Voting Period, if more VEs were paid for than against, then the Proposal
    becomes Democratic.  (Ties cause a change only if the Player who Contested
    the Proposal was the Speaker and Untainted.)

"The Whole Truth" by Kelly
  A Player may be convicted of Perjury or Misrepresentation only if e willfully
    made a false statement of fact.  Specifically:
      * E must intend to make a false statement of fact.
      * E must realize that the statement e makes is false.
      * Excusable negligence, reasonable error, and reasonable reliance on the
          representations of another are defenses.
      * A conclusion as to the interpretation or application of the Rules is
          not a "statement of fact".
  Falsification is merged into Misrepresentation.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Fluid Activity" by Murphy
  The 96-hour waiting period between going On Hold and coming Off Hold is
    repealed.

"Group votes are a' blocked" by Goethe
  If a Group casts at least one Vote on a Proposal, then its entire Voting
    Power is deemed to have been cast with equal FOR/AGAINST/ABSTAIN value.

"Help New Players" by harvel
  New Players become Unready at the beginning of eir Grace Period, and Ready at
    the end of it.
  An Unready Player may become Ready by saying so.
  Rule 698 (Always an Eligible Judge) explicitly asserts its power to command
    Inactive Players, and extends eligibility to the Caller as a last resort.
  An Unready Player does not appear in the Order of Succession to the
    Speakership.
  Ordering an Unready Player to Formally Apologize for violating a Rule is
    optional.
  An Unready Player may expunge half of any Blots e receives.
  The New Player Award is, for each Bank Currency, three-quarters of the
    average holdings of that Currency of Players not in their Grace Period.
  All Players currently in their Grace Period become Unready.
  All Players who registered on or after September 21, 2000, with a Grace
    Period, receive the New Player Award.

"Making Democracy easy but expensive" by Ian
  The power to make Proposals Democratic is given to all Players.  It now costs
    0.1 VE, but gives that Player an extra Vote on the Proposal.

"The Constant Struggle for Supremacy" by Blob
  A Player's Supremacy is initially zero.
  A Player may increase eir Supremacy by paying an equal quantity of Stems.
  At the end of the week, all Supremacies double.
  The current High Oligarch's Supremacy is 200, that of the Middle Oligarchs is
    100, and that of the Low Oligarchs is 50.
  Each week, the Grand Warden of the Oligarchy shall announce the Players with
    the six highest non-zero Supremacies at the start of the week.  The highest
    becomes the High Oligarch, the next two become Middle Oligarchs, and the
    next three become Low Oligarchs.  If there are less than six such Players,
    then the remaining positions are vacant.  Ties are resolved in favor of the
    Player who paid to increase eir Supremacy least recently.
  A Player's Supremacy becomes and remains zero whenever something happens that
    would currently cause em to lose an Oligarch position.
  A Player may set eir Supremacy to zero by saying so.

"The Reset Switch" by Blob
  The Speaker or the High Oligarch may reset the game, With 10 Supporters.
  When the game is reset:
    1) All Electees are retired
    2) A Speaker Transition occurs
    3) The Oligarchy becomes completely vacant
    4) All Zombies are deregistered
    5) All Property is destroyed
    6) All Organizations are dissolved
    7) All Players are deemed to be New Players, and get Grace Periods.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1268  "Peekee has committed the Crime of Application Fraud as described in
[TRUE]     Rule 1626 by claiming that eir Application (included in Evidence
           below) was signed by Players who did not actually sign that
           Application."
          2/7      Called by Wes
          2/7      Assigned to lee, who Judges TRUE, issues a Sentencing Order,
                     and Orders a Formal Apology
          2/8      lee's Judgement Appealed by Peekee
          2/10     Appeal assigned to Chuck, Steve, and (improperly) Wes
          2/15     Steve moves to overturn and reassign
          2/16     Appeal assigned to Chuck, Steve, and Elysion
          2/16     Chuck moves to overturn and reassign
          2/17     Elysion moves to overturn and reassign
          2/25     Reassigned to Razl, who Judges TRUE at some point between
                     2/25 and 3/14, issues a Sentencing Order, and Orders a
                     Formal Apology
          3/15     Peekee appeals Razl's Sentencing Order, as lee had already
                     issued one
          3/18     Razl penalizes Peekee for Failure to Apologize
          3/18     Elysion and Wes Appeal Razl's Sentencing Order
          3/18     Appeal of Razl's Sentencing Order assigned to Elysion,
                     Steve, and Ziggy
          3/22     Razl's Judgement Appealed by Peekee
          3/22-24  Steve, Ziggy, and Elysion sustain Razl's Sentencing Order
          3/23     Appeal of Judgement mistakenly assigned to Taral, Steve,
                     and pTang; Taral's failed attempt to come Off Hold on
                     March 19 had been overlooked
          3/23-24  Steve and pTang move to sustain Razl's Judgement
          3/24     Taral attempts to move to sustain Razl's Judgement
          4/8      Taral replaced by Blob on Board of Appeals
          4/9      Blob moves to sustain Razl's Judgement
          Caller's argument (summary):  Peekee published a Dissenting Position,
            then changed it to Concurring and got some signatures, then sent
            the Dissenting copy by mistake.
          Counterargument:  X is the action Peekee performed.  Y is the action
            Peekee believed e was performing at the time.  Peekee believed that
            X was a Crime (or would have if anyone had pointed it out), but did
            not believe that Y was a Crime.  If eir belief about Y is what
            matters, then Rule 1575's last paragraph forgives Peekee.
          Commentary:  lee submitted eir Judgement early by mistake (by eir own
            admission) and had not yet addressed Peekee's defense.
          Judge Razl's argument (summary):  The action Peekee actually
            performed is what matters.

CFJ 1279  "Proposal 4112 is Democratic."
[FALSE]   2/21      Called by Murphy
Appealed  2/26-3/2  Assigned to pTang, who Judges FALSE
          3/3-5     Appealed by Murphy, Taral, and Elysion
          3/30      Appeal assigned to lee, Steve, and Wes
          4/5       Steve and lee move to overturn and reassign
          4/7       Wes is automatically recused
          4/8       Wes attempts to move to overturn and reassign; eir
                      automatic recusal had been overlooked
          4/8       Mistakenly reassigned to Hooloovoo
          4/13      Hooloovoo proto-Judges FALSE (or attempts to do so)
          4/13      Wes replaced by Razl on Board of Appeals
          Caller's argument (summary):  If CFJ 1278 is false, then so is this;
            otherwise, while Proposal 4111 is adopted too early to place a
            requirement on the Assessor to announce Proposal 4112's failing
            quorum, it may still cause Proposal 4112 to become Democratic upon
            the Assessor's announcement.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Assessor t's announcement that
            Proposal 4112 failed quorum was not required by Rule 1965, so it
            was not "such an announcement" to cause Proposal 4112 to become
            Democratic.
          Board of Appeals grounds for overturning (summary):  There are three
            possible readings of "such an announcement" (of failed Quorum) in
            Rule 1965:  any announcement, an announcement required by the
            Rules, and an announcement required by Rule 1965 itself.  pTang
            failed to consider the second possibility.  Also, due to the
            partly-switched information in the relevant announcement by
            Assessor t, it may be that Proposal 4112 failing Quorum was
            announced before Rule 1965 was created.

CFJ 1286  "The Herald is required to bill Syllepsis the Zombie Transfer Tax 
[FALSE]    of 0.1 Indulgences for transfering 1 Zombie to the Bank"
          3/27      Called by Syllepsis
          3/27      Improperly assigned to Crito, who was On Hold
          3/29-4/3  Assigned to Elysion, who Judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Syllepsis attempted to create a
            Currency called Zombies, mint some units of it, and transfer one
            to the Bank.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  An entity does not change a Rule's
            referent merely by having the same name as the Rule's original
            referent.

CFJ 1287  "The message (as quoted above) Goethe sent titled "Contest 
[TRUE]     announcement: Bardic Gatherings" failed to create a Contest."
          3/30      Called by Peekee
          3/31-4/6  Assigned to Tim, who Judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Only an Application (to Create an
            Organization) can create a Contest, but Goethe did not designate
            eir message as an Application (as required by Rule 1626).

CFJ 1288  "The Bank transfered 100 stems to me on April 3, 2001."
[FALSE]   4/3     Called by Hooloovoo
          4/6-13  Assigned to Steve, who Judges FALSE
          4/9     Taral attempts to Appeal Steve's proto-Judgement
          Caller's argument (summary):  lee wrote
            "The Bank owes Hooloovoo 50 Stems.
             The Bank owes Hooloovoo 50 Stems.
             The Bank satisfies the above debts."
            but the Bank actually owed only one debt of 50 Stems to Hooloovoo.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  It is clear what Property lee intended
            to transfer, so the basic definition of a Notice of Transfer is
            met.  However, Rule 1470 prevents the Bank from transferring its
            Property in the absence of a debt, and so Rule 1598 (3) prevents
            an attempt at such a transfer from being a Notice of Transfer.

ERRATA
------

Taral failed to come Off Hold on March 19, as it had not yet been 96 hours
since e last went On Hold.  This had the following effects:

* Eir Nomination for Justiciar was invalid.  This did not change the final
  result of that Election.

* Eir first Nomination for Speaker-Elect was invalid.  E Nominated again after
  successfully coming Off Hold.

* Eir Bids in the VE Auction beginning on March 16 were invalid.  This changed
  the winners and the Winning Bid.

* Eir assignment to the Board of Appeals for CFJ 1268 was invalid.  Blob was
  assigned in eir place.
