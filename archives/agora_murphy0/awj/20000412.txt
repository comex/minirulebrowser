PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Auction fix" by Taral
   Bids may not be cancelled, but may be replaced with higher Bids.
   Auctions end after 7 days, regardless of Bid timing.
   If the highest losing Bid is less than the lowest winning Bid, then

   Rule 1888 (Private Auctions) is repealed.

"Clean the Queue Faster" by Wes - Proposal 3992
   Following a Batch distribution, each Proposal still in the Queue has its
     Priority reduced by a minimum of 5.

"Extreme Measures" by Taral
   When a Legislator announces eir intent to cause a Proposal to be
     adopted, then it is adopted if and only if
       * No Player Objects within four days
       * At least two Senators Support
       * The Senator who announced intent announces its adoption

"Points Re^2visited" by t - Proposal 3993
   Points are no longer a Currency.

"Ratification fix" by Taral - Proposal 3995
   Reports may be ratified by instruments other than adopted Proposals.

"Simplify Power" by harvel - Proposal 3994
   Rule 1688 (Power) is reworded in a simpler fashion.

"Social Policy" by t
   Zombies do not receive Minimum Income, nor do Players who were Inactive
     for at least 17 days in the previous month.

"Transfer Orders may not be Vacated" by Taral
   Repeal Rule 1818 (Vacation of Transfer Orders), which actually defines
     what a Currency Recordkeepor must do when a Transfer Order is vacated.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Automatic Proxy Bidding" by Chuck
   Auctions end after 7 days, regardless of Bid timing.
   If the highest losing Bid is less than the lowest winning Bid, then
     the winners are billed the highest losing Bid + 1 MUQ of the Currency.
   Rule 1888 (Private Auctions) is repealed.

"Balanced Auctions" by Taral
   Bids may not be cancelled within 24 hours of the end of the Auction.
   The Auctioneer may cancel the entire Auction, except within 24 hours
     of its end.

"Balanced Auctions take 2" by Taral
   Bids may not be cancelled, but may be replaced.

"Cleanup avoidable rules" by Taral
   Repeal Rule 1730 (Delayed Transfer Orders), the idea being that a
   "timed stay" can accomplish the same effect.

"Extreme Measures" by Taral
   A Legislator may, Without Objection, cause a Proposal to be adopted.

"Invalid unless proven valid" by Taral
   Amend Rule 1796 (Validity of Orders) to discount implicit permission,
     such as that granted by Rule 101.

"Kinder and Gentler" by Blob
   After four days of Quietness, an Electee may be forced to Delegate via
     announcement of the Speaker (or, if the Electee is the Speaker, the
     Speaker-Elect).  If the Electee becomes Noisy, the Delegation ends
     immediately.

"Make urgent proposals useful" by Taral
   Urgent Proposals not only can be distributed immediately, but must be.

"Officer Reform" by harvel
   If an Office's duties include being the Recordkeepor of a Currency, then
     records for that Currency are part of that Office's Report.
   Monthly Reports are defined.

"Probate Yet Again" by Wes
   Wills are no longer SLCs.
   While the Executor of an entity in Probate, the Notary may only act as
     required by "Automatic Dispensation":
       1) Pay debts.
       2) Expunge Blots.
       3) Implement Will.
       4) Transfer Currency to Bank; vacate credits.
       5) Declare end of Probate.
   Rule 1757 (Implementation of Probate Plans) is repealed as redundant.

"Property" by Kelly
   Currency is generalized into Property.  (Elements of Property may be
     uniquely distinguishable.)

"Speaker Delegation" by Taral
   The Speaker may delegate any Office e holds, even if e is not Electee.

"Transfer Orders may be Vacated" by Taral
   (This proto would amend Rule 1818 to claim that a Transfer Order may
    be vacated by the Player who executed it.  However, this would still
    be trumped by Rule 1799, which restricts vacation of Transfer Orders
    to delayed Transfer Orders still in their delay period.)

"Watch the Watchdogs" by Wes
   A Payment Order is overdue when it is continuously effective for seven
     days without being satisfied.
   The Clerk of the Courts and Justiciar are authorized to detect and report
     Persistent Indebtedness committed by Currency Recordkeepors.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1203 "The Auction for High Oligarch started on Monday, 06 Mar 2000 at
[TRUE]    23:40:31 -0800 has ended."
          3/15      Called by Blob
          3/15-17   Assigned to Peekee, who Judges TRUE
          3/18      Appealed by Oerjan, lee, and Blob
          3/18      Appeal assigned to Murphy, Anthony, and harvel
          3/22      harvel moves to overturn and reassign
          3/24      Murphy moves to overturn and reassign
          3/25      Anthony defaults
          3/27-4/3  Appeal position reassigned to Chuck, who defaults
          4/4       Appeal position reassigned to lee, who moves to overturn
                      and reassign
          4/5       Reassigned to Taral, who Judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  No winning Bids were made since
            harvel's winning Bid on 3/9, even though harvel retracted that
            Bid on 3/11.  Thus, the auction ended on 3/12.
          Justice harvel's refutation (summary):  Neither of Judge
            Peekee's stated reasons are sufficient to support eir verdict.
          Justice Murphy's refutation (summary):  Judge Peekee points out
            the lack of "hard evidence" to prove that Wes sent eir Bid at
            the time in question.  However, the preponderance of the
            evidence (Rule 1575) indicates that e *did* send eir Bid.

CFJ 1205 "Wes committed the Class 1 Crime of Promotor Misrepresentation
[TRUE]    when he distributed Proposal 3988 (Harsher Blot Penalties), on
           Thu, 16 Mar 2000 18:20:25 -0800"
          3/24     Called by Steve
          3/24-31  Assigned to elJefe, who Judges TRUE
          4/1      Motion for Blob and Apology reassigned to harvel, who
                     grants it
          Caller's argument (summary):  Proposal 3988's Priority was too low
            for it to be in the Current Batch at the time in question.

CFJ 1206 "Peekee did not gain 2 Blots due to Tardiness, because of Oerjan's
[TRUE]    Probate."
Appealed 4/1    Called by Peekee
          4/2-7  Assigned to Sherlock, who Judges TRUE
          4/9    Appealed by Steve, Wes, and lee
          4/10   Appeal assigned to Chuck, Blob, and Murphy
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1908 (Automatic Dispensation)
            requires the Notary to perform certain actions in order, and
            Rule 1023 (Definition of ASAP) explicitly allows its timing
            requirements on Official duties to be changed by other Rules.
            Furthermore, the Notary cannot perform certain actions required
            by Rule 1908, because Oerjan is no longer in Probate.
          Counterarguments:  Wes's claim of Infraction is sufficient to
            Blot the Notary, though Rule 1435 (Definition of Indulgences,
            Blots, Immaculate) allows the Blots to be expunged if the claim
            is found invalid.  Rule 1908's ordering requirement is in
            addition to (not instead of) the normal timing requirements of
            ASAP.  The Notary's inability to perform an action does not
            prevent em from being required to perform it, unless the Rules
            explicitly say so.
