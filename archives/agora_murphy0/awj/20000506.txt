"Oligarchy Auctions 'in progress'" by Steve - Proposal 4000 adopted 5/2

     the bill is vacated, the Bidder is penalized 2 Blots, and a new Auction
     for that position occurs.
   A winning Bidder assumes eir Oligarch position when eir bill is satisfied,
     even if e does not satisfy it emself.
   Only winning Bids are considered when determining the amount that winning
     Bidders in any sort of Auction are billed.

     1 to 3.)

"Score fix" by Taral
   A Player gaining the Patent Title of Distributor does not receive
     Points for it.

"Speaker Delegation" by Taral
   The Speaker may delegate any Office e holds, even if e is not Electee.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Fix Ratification" by Murphy
   "Official Document" is replaced with "document".

     selected by the Speaker) by replacing "and" with "xor", "xor" with

     an improper Transfer Order is executed (not submitted).

"Probate Yet Again" by Wes

       3) Implement Will.
       4) Transfer Currency to Bank; vacate credits.
       5) Declare end of Probate.

CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1209 "The change to the minimum wage on March 30, 2000 was invalid
[FALSE]   and the subsequent minimum wage PO's were incorrect."
          4/17     Called by lee
          4/17-24  Assigned to Chuck, who Judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1893 (The Treasuror's Budget)
            requires the Minimum Income to be an integer multiple of 0.1
            times the Basic Officer Salary, but the attempted change on
            3/30 was to 0.25 times the Basic Officer Salary.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Rule 1893 requires the Minimum
            Income to be "given in" such a multiple - that is, requires
            the Treasuror to choose only such a multiple.  Rule 1906
            (Amending the Budget) permits the Treasuror to choose a value
            that is not such a multiple, and have it take effect, though
            e violates Rule 1893 by doing so.

CFJ 1210 "Kelly is not the nickname of a Player"
          5/1  Called by Palnatoke
          5/1  Assigned to Murphy

CFJ 1211 "The announcement required by Rule 1927 must contain the number
[DISMISS] of new units of Currency the Executor intends to Mint."
          5/2    Called by Taral
          5/2-3  Assigned to Kelly, who dismisses the CFJ
          Judge's reasoning (summary):  Rule 1927 does not require any
            announcement to be made; it only prevents Minting in the
            absence of an announcement.

CFJ 1212 "Wes became the High Oligarch on Wed, 3 May 2000 12:48:35 +0300."
          5/4    Called by t
          5/?-5  Assigned to Peekee, who tentatively agrees with #2 below
                   (but has not given any reasoning)
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1937 (Filling Vacancies in the
            Oligarchy) specifies that the Low Oligarchs select a Middle
            Oligarch to become High Oligarch, but does not specify when the
            selection takes effect.  Reasonable possibilities are:
              #1) Wed, 3 May 2000 09:49:12 +0100 - Majority established
              #2) Wed, 3 May 2000 12:48:35 +0300 - All three votes cast
              #3) Thu, 4 May 2000 00:00:00 GMT   - Three-day deadline expires

[old]
CFJ 1206 "Peekee did not gain 2 Blots due to Tardiness, because of Oerjan's
[FALSE]   Probate."
          4/1      Called by Peekee
          4/2-7    Assigned to Sherlock, who Judges TRUE
          4/9      Appealed by Steve, Wes, and lee
          4/10-14  Appeal assigned to Chuck, Blob, and Murphy, who unanimously
                     move to overturn and reassign
          4/14-15  Reassigned to Anthony, who becomes a Zombie
          4/16-18  Reassigned to else...if, who Judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1908 (Automatic Dispensation)
            requires the Notary to perform certain actions in order, and
            Rule 1023 (Definition of ASAP) explicitly allows its timing
            requirements on Official duties to be changed by other Rules.
            Furthermore, the Notary cannot perform certain actions required
            by Rule 1908, because Oerjan is no longer in Probate.
          Counterarguments:  Wes's claim of Tardiness is sufficient to Blot
            the Notary.  Peekee transferred a total of 94 VTs from Oerjan,
            but Oerjan had 124 VTs per the Accountor's Report of 3/25, so
            Peekee was indeed Tardy; and this is a cause of eir being Blotted,
            albeit possibly an indirect cause.  Rule 1908's ordering
            requirement is in addition to (not instead of) the normal timing
            requirements of ASAP.  The Notary's inability to perform an action
            does not prevent em from being required to perform it, unless the
            Rules explicitly say so.

CFJ 1207 "An Official Report ratified according to Rule 1791 (Ratification
[FALSE]   Without Objection) is ratified by an Officer, not by Rule 1791
           itself. Rule 1791 is an Instrument, but Officers are not
           Instruments, so Rule 1550 (Ratification) does not attempt to
           prohibit this method of ratification."
          4/13     Called by Murphy
          4/13-14  Assigned to Wes, who Judges FALSE
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Rule 1791 attempts to allow the
            Speaker to Ratify Reports, possibly without holding any Office,
            so the first sentence is not always true.

CFJ 1208 "The Herald's Report was last ratified after 01Feb2000"
[TRUE]   4/14     Called by Elysion
          4/16-19  Assigned to Blob, who Judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Elysion allegedly ratified the
            Herald's Report, Without Objection, on 2/14.  Kelly and Wes
            argue that Rule 1552 (Requirements for Ratification), by
            declaring a document legal to ratify "at the time the Proposal
            which would ratify it is Proposed", implies that no document
            is legal to ratify when no such Proposal exists.
          Judge's opinion (summary):  When no such Proposal exists, Rule
            1552 is void, and Rule 101 then makes any document legal to
            ratify.

         Salary from 75 to 38 Stems, and double all figures (Officer

         terms of the BOS.  Taral gives Support, and lee makes the change.
       (The Minimum Income is changed to 0.5 times the BOS.  This is based
         on its alleged previous value of 0.25 times the BOS, which may
         not have been valid; see CFJ 1209.)

       Treasuror lee announces eir intent to increase the Basic Officer

         Proposals to Public.  Taral and harvel give Support, and t

         change it back to 2, but Rule 1839 (The Promotor Can Change
