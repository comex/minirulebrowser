PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

<no title> by Goethe
  Actions during a Holiday are considered to have been sent at the end of the
    Holiday, but in the order they were actually sent.
  Time limits that would expire during a Holiday instead expire 72 hours after
    the end of the Holiday.

<no title> by Maud
  Players may perform actions by announcement if the Rules allow it, but do not
    provide a method.

    "quarterly", and "yearly", but no longer to anything else.

"10th Anniversary Preparations" by Goethe

    other Contests cease to be Bardic.
  A Bardic Contest may award the Unique Patent Title of Harold Victor; the
    recipient also becomes a Bard.  Any previous holder gains the Patent Title
    of Old Harold.

"A new framework" by multiple Players
  Goethe:
    The Office of Electrician tracks each entity's Energy and Voltage.
    Energy is a non-negative integral number of Ergs.
    A Grounded Player is a Player with zero Energy.
    Batteries have Voltage (number) and Termini (subset of Players).
    A Player's Potential is the sum of eir Voltages.
    Dissipative Batteries experience a monthly Power Drain (halving Voltage,
      or zeroing it if it would be less than 1).
    Each Player has a Capacitance, a Dissipative Battery unique to em, which is
      zero unless changed by the Rules or a Power >= 2 Proposal.
    Each month, the Reset Button is pushed, resetting each Player's Energy to
      eir Potential (minimum 1).  This is the only time Energy may increase.
    New Player Award is converted to New Player Voltage (2 to 8; the new
      Player's Capacitance is set to the NPV, then eir Energy is reset).
    An energetic action is one with a Charge.
    Performing an energetic action requires sufficient Energy, and causes
      Energy equal to the Charge to dissipate.
    Minimum Income, Salaries, Distributor's Gratuity, and Speaker's Gratuity
      are converted to Constant Batteries.
    Judicial Salary is converted to Judicial Lightning (1 to 3).
    Mentors' Bonus increases each Mentor's Capacitance by the New Player
      Voltage divided by the number of Mentors.
    Each Player's Capacitance is set to
      Stems/50 + VEs + Indulgences/10 + Papyri/25.
    Reset button is pushed.
    Stems, VEs, Indulgences, Winner's Stipend, Taxes, Looting Auctions, and
      alternate Auction Procedures are repealed.  Possibly Land as well.
  Murphy:
    Indulgences are repealed.
    Indulgence costs (expunging Blots, changing Role early, bidding in Looting
      Auctions and Land Auctions) are replaced by Charges.
    Tolls cause moving into the Tolled unit of Land to have a Charge, which
      Energizes the owner when incurred.
  Michael:
    VEs, Tolls, and Monks are repealed.
    Oligarch Upkeep is converted to Oligarch Charge Requirement.
    Voting Power is converted to Voting Potential.  It is reset to zero each
      month, and may be increased for a Charge.
    Chamber Fee is converted to a Charge.
    Any eligible Player may become an Oligarch by meeting the Oligarch Charge
      Requirement.
    Oligarchs serve for a term, and may extend it by multiples of the term for
      a Charge.
  Steve:
    Stems, the Payroll Clerk, and Monks are repealed.
    Stems (Birthday awards, Mentor's Bonus, successful Rebellion bonus,
      Patronage) are converted to Charges.

"Action Land" by Eris
  An entity may spend 20 Action Units to set the Land Type of an adjacent Unit
    of Aether owned by the Land Bureau to either Black or White, at random; the
    Land Bureau incurs a debt to the entity for that Unit.

"Agencies" by Goethe
  The concept of Parliamentary Votes is repealed.
  The Executor of an Agency is its Minister.
  At most five entities are Agencies; if necessary, the older ones are deemed
    not to be Agencies.
  All Monks are Agents of the Monastary.
  All Bards are Agents of the Fiddlers Green.
  All Players with enough Kudos are Agents of the Samurai.
  All Land-owning Players are Agents of the Landowners Association.
  All Devices are Agents of Module.
  The Minister without Portfolio is the Officer who tracks Agencies in a
    Monthly Report.
  The MwP is the Minister of any Moribund (Agent-less) Agency, but such an
    Agency may act only to transfer Property to satisfy its debts.
  The SLC of an Agency is its Traditions.
  An Agency's Traditions may only be changed by:
    * Proposals with Adoption Index >= 2.
    * Proposals made distributable by an Agent as explicitly permitted by the
        Traditions, and without (N = quorum on a Democratic Proposal)
        objections.
    * The Minister as allowed or required by the Traditions, with the Support
        of the MwP and two Ministers of non-Moribund Agencies.
  Once a month, if allowed by its Traditions, an Agency may make an Agent an
    Oligarch by paying the Base Seating Fee; any Player previously made an
    Oligarch by that Agency ceases to be an Oligarch.  The Agency may pay eir
    Agent's Oligarch Upkeep.
  The Traditions of the Monastery are set to allow Agents to make Proposals
    distributable without N objections, etc. and the other Agencies are
    similarly initialized with Traditions granting unique powers to Agents.

"Bring Bonds Back" by Sir Toby
  Bonds are Property.
  Each Bond has a species, a series, an issuer, a face value, and a maturity
    date.  (Unspecified times are presumed to be midnight UTC at the beginning
    of the day.)
  All Bonds of a species are fungible.
  The Office of Usuror is the Recordkeepor of Bonds.
  The Usuror is Prime Executor of the Bank with respect to Bonds.  E may cause
    the Bank to create Bonds, and transfer Bonds to its creditors.
  The Usuror assigns a distinct series to each species of Bonds.
  An entity with Bond Issuance Authority may create Bonds (in eir possession)
    by informing the Usuror of the face value and maturity date.
  Only the Bank has Bond Issuance Authority.
  The owner of Bonds may destroy them by notifying the Usuror.
  The owner of Bonds may redeem them by announcement; the issuer incurs a debt
    equal to the face value of the Bond, and the Bond is destroyed.
  A Bond is automatically redeemed if its issuer ceases to have an Executor.
  The issuer of a Bond may call it by announcement; it is redeemed.
  When the Bank cannot satisfy a debt due to insufficient funds, it may instead
    satisfy it by announcing its conversion to Bond Debt; the Bank owes the
    creditor one Bond with a face value of the original debt plus 10 percent,
    and a maturity date of 30 days from the time of the conversion.
  Alternately:  When the Bank cannot satisfy a debt due to insufficient funds,
    the Recordkeepor may notify the Usuror; e is no longer responsible for
    paying the debt, and cannot be penalized over it.  The Usuror shall issue
    and auction Bonds sufficient to cover the debt, upon which the Recordkeepor
    once again becomes responsible for paying the debt.

"Coulda, Woulda, Shoulda" by Murphy
  Players are not penalized for performing required actions, or failing to
    perform actions that are prohibited or regulated-without-a-method.  This
    includes Rules, valid Orders, and Orders later found to be invalid.
  Mangled grammar in Rule 1810 (Noncompliance with Orders) is fixed.

"down with voting officers" by Goethe
  A balanced action is an action Upon the Balance of X Surveying Y, where X
    is a positive real number and Y is a positive integer.
  An action Upon Balance is an action Upon the Balance of 1 Surveying Q, where
    Q is one-third the number of Players (rounded up).
  After a Player announces intent to perform a balanced action, the Achieved
    Balance is the ratio of supporters to objectors (or Unanimity if there is
    at least one supporter and no objector), and the Survey Size is the number
    of supporters plus the number of objectors.
  A Player may perform a balanced action by announcement, between 7 and 14 days
    after announcing intent, if the Survey Size is at least Y and the Achieved
    Balance is greater than X.
  A Player may Adopt one of eir Proposals Upon the Balance of its Adoption
    Index Surveying Quorum.
  All other aspects of making and Voting on Proposals are repealed.

"Elucidate Registration" by Maud
  Registering while already registered is the Crime of Concurrent Registration.
  A convicted Player forfeits all eir Property, all debts owed to em, and all
    Votes e cast while accused.
  Actions performed prior to the accusation are deemed to have been performed
    by different persons.
  The penalty may be reduced if the Player did not perform actions while
    accused.
  Maud is convicted of Concurrent Legislation; the CotC shall randomly select
    an eligible Judge to impose the penalty.

"Executors and Currency Transfers" by Murphy
  Transfers performed while acting as Executor or Limited Executor of another
    entity have that entity as the transferor, unless otherwise specified.

  The Contestmaster of a Contest may change when the Rules require or allow it,
    even if the Regulations provide no method.

  Only Active Players may serve on a Thesis Committee.
  If the Candidate does not make a valid selection for the first member, then
    the Speaker is selected.
  The second member is selected by (not yet written).
  If the first two members do not agree on a third member within a week, then
    a random eligible Player is selected.
  Vacancies are filled by (not yet written).  If there are no eligible Players,
    (not yet written).
  The Chair is the Player who has been on the committee the longest.

"Freedoms of Speech and Terminology" by Maud
  Players shall not be prohibited from using the Fora, nor punished for.
    statements made there.
  Ordinary-language synonyms of Rule-defined terms mean what the Rule-defined
    terms mean.
  Terms primarily used in a mathematical or legal context have that meaning.
  Terms otherwise undefined have their ordinary-language meaning.

"Justice and Mercy" by Goethe
  A Judge may reduce the penalty for a Crime by up to half, on the grounds of
    first offense, past service, extenuating circumstances, or the submission
    of a Formal Apology.
  The Defendant, or any Player with support, may Appeal the amount of the
    penalty.  The Appeals Board may Order the Judge to reduce, increase, or
    maintain the amount, although the Judge may decide the amount of change.

"Kudos" by Murphy
  The Harpy keeps track of Kudos.
  Players start with 20 Kudos.
  Up to twice a week, a Player may transfer a Kudo from a Player (the Heel) to
    another Player (the Face), giving reasons for both.  E may not make someone
    the Face twice in a week, or the Heel twice in a week.  E may not make
    emself the Face.
  The Patent Title of Samurai goes to Players with at least 30 Kudos.
  The Patent Title of Honourless Worm goes to Players with less than 5 Kudos.
  The Unique Patent Title of Shogun goes to the Player with the most Kudos (at
    least 10), if there is exactly one such Player.

"Law Enforcement" by Sherlock
  The Office of Sheriff keeps track of commissions of Crimes and Infractions.
  The Sheriff may report any Infraction.
  An entity committing a Crime or Infraction that e committed within the past
    three months pays twice the Blot penalty e paid last time.
  An Officer committing more than five Infractions related to eir Office within
    three months is automatically removed.  This replaces Dereliction of Duty.
  The Order of Succession for Speaker-Elect is changed from
    (Promotor, Registrar, Rulekeepor, Assessor, Justiciar, CotC) to
    (Justiciar, CotC, Sheriff, Rulekeepor, Registrar).

"Law Enforcement, Part II" by Sherlock
  If an Infraction goes unreported for two weeks, then any unauthorized Player
    may report it for a Stem bounty equal to the Class of the Infraction.
  If a Crime or Infraction goes unreported for longer than its Statute of
    Limitations (normally six months), then no conviction may take place.

"LAZY-NO-JUDGE" by Peekee
  Requests for ineligibility do not expire automatically, but the CotC may

    Player Expenditure Allowance (1 to 20)
    Group Expenditure Allowance (1 to 20)
    Group Bonus Factor (0 to 5)
    Gote Bonus Factor (-3 to 3)
  Each Player and Group's weekly allowance is modified by the Gote Bonus Factor
    times the number of Land Units with Gote e owned at the start of the week.
  Each Group's weekly allowance is modified by the Group Bonus Factor times the
    number of members at or adjacent to its location at the start of the week.
  The Budget is initialized to values matching the current Rules (PEA = 10,
    GEA = 1, Group BF = 3, Gote BF = 1).

"Monks" by Maud
  See Proposal "Switches".
  Appetite is a Player switch.
  A Hearty Player who has no Property, no Blots, and is not the Executor of
    another entity, may flip eir Appetite to Ascetic.
  A Monk who becomes Hearty loses eir Role, and cannot flip eir Role for 14
    days.
  The Monastery is an entity.  Its Executor is the Head Monk.
  While there are no Monks, the Treasuror is the Head Monk, but may only cause
    it to satisfy its debts.
  If the Head Monk is not a Monk and a Player becomes a Monk, then that Player
    becomes the Head Monk.
  If the Head Monk ceases to be a Monk, then the Player who has been a Monk the
    longest becomes the Head Monk.
  A Monk may become the Head Monk with 2 Monk Support.
  A Monk who receives Property shall transfer it to the Monastery.  If e does
    not transfer it ASAP, then any Player may flip eir Appetite to Hearty (thus
    relieving em of the obligation).
  If a Monk has Blots or is the Executor of another entity (besides the
    Monastery), then any Player may flip eir Appetite to Hearty.
  The Monastery may participate in Property transfer agreements and Auctions,
    with the approval of the Head Monk and at least two other Monks.
  The Head Monk shall use the Monastery's resources to encourage charity,
    frugality, and levity.
  The Head Monk may rubberstamp N^2 Proposals per week (N is the number of
    Monks at the beginning of the week).
  Once a week, the Head Monk may expunge one Blot from a Blotted non-Monk.  If
    e could have done so during a week, but does not, then any Player may flip
    eir Appetite to Hearty.
  Monk is a Role.
  A Politician may increase eir Voting Power on a Proposal by 1 by paying
    (X+2)/10 VEs (X is the number of times e has done so that week for any
    Proposal).
  Monks do not get Minimum Income.

"No Sente Awards for the Apathetic" by Sir Toby
  (0, 0) and only (0, 0) is Beige.
  Beige never has either Sente or Gote.

"Octarine Repeals" by Murphy
  Repeal most of the Ruleset, including Executors, Holidays, Offices and
    Elections, Roles, Rebellion, the Oligarchy, Elections, Orders, Crimes and
    Infractions, Patent Titles, Degrees, Property, Wins, SLCs, and Land.
  All Proposals are effectively Distributable, Democratic, and Sane.
  CFJs may be assigned to anyone but the Caller.  There are no Appeals.

"Pay Out Contests" by Sir Toby
  A Pay Out Contest is a Contest that may pay out Bank Currency.
  The amount of Bank Currency that a Contest may pay out per month may be
    changed by an instrument of Power >= 1.
  The Contestmaster of a Contest may (without objection) declare the amount of
    Bank Currency that a Contest may pay out per month.  The announcement of
    intent must include the Regulations.  The Regulations must not change
    between the announcement of intent and the declaration (or else the
    declaration is the Crime of Bait and Switch).
  A Player may be Contestmaster of only one Pay Out Contest at a time.  If e
    is Contestmaster of more, then they all lose the ability to pay out Bank
    Currency.
  The Regulations of a Pay Out Contest may not self-amend.
  The Contestmaster of a Pay Out Contest must publish the Regulations ASAP
    after it becomes a Pay Out Contest, and monthly (failure to do the latter
    is the Infraction of Failure to be Accountable).
  The Contestmaster of a Pay Out Contest may pay out Bank Currency to a
    Contestant.

"Procrastinators" by Pakaran
  The Speaker, or any Player with 2 support, may award the Patent Title of
    Procrastinator to a Player who confuses understanding of the Gamestate
    through procrastination (malicious or not).
  Any Player with 2 support (not including the Bearer) may revoke this Title.
  Pakaran is awarded this Title.

"Public Fora" by Maud
  See Proposal "Switches".
  Publicity (null, Discussion, Public) is a stuck forum switch.
  Other current aspects of Fora are re-stated in terms of switches.

"Switch Reduction Act" by Maud
  Viscosity of switches (loose/stuck) is no longer a switch.
  A stuck switch may be flipped only when an Officer is required or allowed to
    flip it.

"Team Contest" by Goethe
  The Unique Patent Title of Game Show Host is awarded to the (captain / Player
    with most points) of a winning Team.  Between the win and the formation of
    new Teams, e may give this Title to another Player (with eir consent).
  The Game Show Host is not placed on a new Team.  E may create a Game Show
    Contest, which may announce a winning Team in accordance with its
    Regulations (the captain of the winning Team must be a Contestant).

"The Greek System" by Sherlock
  Rename the Speaker to Chronos, Officers to other Greek gods/goddesses, the
    Inner Cabinet to Olympus, and the Outer Cabinet to The Giants.

"The Life Cycle of Proposals" by Maud
  Rules 1483 (Definition of Proposals), 1698 (The Proposal System is
    Protected), 1891 (Legislative Orders), and part of 594 (Power and
    Proposals) are merged into Rule 404 (Legality of Proposals).
  Rule changes are converted to Legislative Orders ordering the Rulekeepor to
    change the Rules.

"Tiered Proposals" by Sherlock
  A Proposal's Adoption Index is equal to its Voting Index.
  Each provision of a Proposal may list what Adoption Index is required for it
    to have effect; if none is listed, it is 1.

"Treasure Hunt" by Peekee
  The Mapkeepor shall randomly select a secret location for the Treasure.
  A Player may spend one Action Unit to search eir location for Treasure.
  If a Player finds the Treasure, the Mapkeepor shall pay out the Basic Officer
    Salary to that Player, and select a location for the Treasure.

"Wagers" by Sherlock
  The Office of Croupier tracks the Line and Wagers on each pending Proposal.
  The Croupier may set the Line on a Proposal in the Pool to an integer from
    -3 to 3.
  Any entity (the Shill) may Wager on a Proposal in the Pool with a Line,
    specifying a positive amount of a Bank Currency (up to eir holdings).
  If a Proposal with a negative Line is adopted, or a Proposal with a positive
    Line is rejected, then the Croupier pays out Wager*[abs(Line)+1] to each
    Shill.
  If a Proposal with a positive Line is adopted, or a Proposal with a negative
    Line is rejected, then the Croupier bills Wager*[abs(Line)+1] to each
    Shill.

CFJ 1424 "The Goddess Eris has commited the class 2 crime of Disobedience."
[TRUE]   1/8      Called by RedKnight
         1/10-17  Assigned to Goethe, who Judges TRUE
         1/17     Goethe announces eir intent (Without Objection) to declare
                    Eris a Ninny
         1/22     Eris publishes a Formal Apology
         1/23     Goethe declares Eris a Ninny
         1/24     Eris re-publishes eir Formal Apology
         Caller's argument (summary):  Eris published a CFJ during a Holiday,
           but had forgotten that doing so was a Rule violation.
         Judge's commentary (summary):  CFJ 1408 set the precedent that
           ignorance of an unambiguous Rule is not "reasonable belief".

CFJ 1425 "Parakan transferred 10 Stems from the Bank to Murphy in the message
[TRUE]    with Message-ID <407606326.1041695839@[192.168.1.100]>."
         1/9      Called by Murphy
         1/12-15  Assigned to Sir Toby, who Judges TRUE
         Caller's argument (summary):  Pakaran stated that e was acting as
           Limited Executor of the Bank, but did not explicitly specify the
           Bank as the transferor.

CFJ 1426 "Absolving (removing) a Blot as per Rule 1986 is not the same as
[FALSE]   Expunging Blots as per Rule 2017."
         Linked to CFJs 1427, 1428, 1429, 1430
         1/13     Called by Goethe
         1/13-15  Assigned to Steve, who Judges FALSE
         Caller's argument (summary):  Eris had 0.68 Blots, and Goethe
           attempted to absolve 1 of Eris's Blots, then attempted to absolve
           0.68 of Eris's Blots.
         Judge's refutation (summary):  Absolving/removing Blots is not defined
           well enough to be a separate procedure from expunging.  Rule 2017
           defines Recordkeeping responsibilities for the latter, but not the
           former.  Thus absolving/removing is synonymous with expunging, and
           Goethe's first attempt expunged 0.68 of Eris's Blots.

CFJ 1427 "Goethe succeeded in removing exactly and only 1.00 Blots from Goddess
[FALSE]   Eris in the same message as this CFJ."
         Linked to CFJs 1426, 1428, 1429, 1430
         1/13     Called by Goethe

[FALSE]  Linked to CFJs 1426, 1427, 1428, 1430

CFJ 1430 "Goddess Eris is not Immaculate."
[FALSE]  Linked to CFJs 1426, 1427, 1428, 1429
         1/13     Called by Goethe
         1/13-15  Assigned to Steve, who Judges FALSE
         Arguments:  See CFJ 1426.

CFJ 1431 "In a message sent at Fri, 17 Jan 2003 10:05:51 -0800, with message id
[FALSE]   <Pine.LNX.4.43.0301171005510.14735@hymn05.u.washington.edu>
          (submitted as evidence), Goethe tried to transfer 0.05 VEs, 0.1
          Indulgences, 0.15 Papyri, and 2 Fish from Support Your Secret Leader
          to both Sir Toby and Steve, but the transfers were invalid and did
          not occur."
         1/21     Called by Sir Toby
         1/22     Mistakenly assigned to Michael (ineligible by request)
         1/22-28  Assigned to t, who makes emself ineligible
         1/28-30  Assigned to Eris, who Judges FALSE
         Caller's argument (summary):  The transfers did not meet the
           restrictions of Regulation 5, and were thus prohibited by
           Regulation 6.
         Judge's refutation (summary):  Regulation 5 created debts, and the
           transfers (over-)satisfied some of those debts.

CFJ 1432 "In a message sent at Fri, 17 Jan 2003 10:05:51 -0800, with message id
[TRUE]    <Pine.LNX.4.43.0301171005510.14735@hymn05.u.washington.edu>
          (submitted as evidence), Goethe tried to transfer 2 Stems from
          Support Your Scret Leader to both Sir Toby and Steve, but the
          transfers were invalid and did not occur."
         1/21  Called by Sir Toby
         1/22  Assigned to Murphy
         Caller's argument (summary):  The transfers did not meet the
           restrictions of Regulation 5, and were thus prohibited by
           Regulation 6, and thus by Rule 1910 as well.

CFJ 1433 "In a message sent at Fri, 17 Jan 2003 10:05:51 -0800, with message id
[TRUE]    <Pine.LNX.4.43.0301171005510.14735@hymn05.u.washington.edu>
          (submitted as evidence), Goethe tried to resign as Contestmaster of
          the Support Your Secret Leader Contest, but was prohibited from doing
          so."
         1/21  Called by Sir Toby
         1/22  Assigned to OscarMeyr
         Caller's argument (summary):  Resigning as Contestmaster constitutes
           a change of Contestmaster.  The regulations do not specify a way to
           change Contestmaster, so it cannot change while the Contest still
           exists; see Rule 1539.  Furthermore, the Contest still existed after
           Goethe's attempt to resign, because it still possessed at least one
           Fish; see Rule 1908.

CFJ 1434 "The registration of a Player and the expiration of eir Grace Period
[TRUE]    are both 'events' for the purposes of Rule 1769 (Holidays)."
         1/24      Called by Cecilius
         1/27-2/2  Assigned to Pakaran, who Judges TRUE

CFJ xxxx "The method used by Goethe in the message with Message-ID
          <Pine.LNX.4.43.0302031253250.32726@hymn01.u.washington.edu>
          is reasonably close to a uniform probability distribution."
         2/3  Called by Murphy
         2/4  Retracted
         Commentary:  Goethe was attempting a uniform probability distribution
           over the range of numbers from 0 to 1, but a non-uniform probability
           distribution among the possible Weather outcomes.

CFJ 1435 "The method used by Goethe in the message with Message-ID
[FALSE]   <Pine.LNX.4.43.0302031253250.32726@hymn01.u.washington.edu>
          is reasonably close to the probability distribution required
          for the action e attempted to perform in that message (i.e.
          determine the Weather for February 2003)."
         2/4    Called by Murphy
         2/4-9  Assigned to Steve, who Judges FALSE
         Commentary:  Goethe's method was to pick digits from the millionth
           digit of pi onward, and map the resulting number (between 0 and 1)
           to a Weather outcome.
         Judge's refutation (summary):  Trivially false, because Goethe's
           mapping of numbers to Weather outcomes was incorrect.

CFJ 1436 "The Grand Warden of the Oligarchy is not empowered to remove from
[TRUE]    the Oligarchy a player who is not ineligible to be an Oligarch."
         2/10     Called by Steve
         2/13-20  Assigned to Goethe, who Judges TRUE
         Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1963 regulates removal from the
           Oligarchy, and ineligibility to be an Oligarch.  Neither clause
           covers defaulting on upkeep.

CFJ 1437 "Where the Bank has been properly ordered to forgive a debt
[TRUE]    denominated in a Bank Currency, only the Treasuror is both
          permitted and required to act on the Bank's behalf to forgive the
          debt."
         2/16     Called by Steve
         2/18-20  Assigned to Sherlock, who Judges TRUE
         Caller's argument (summary):  Currency Recordkeepors only have
           authority over debts owed by the Bank.  Debts owed to the Bank
           fall under the authority of the Treasuror, who is the only
           (non-Limited) Executor of the Bank.

CFJ 1438 "The Order issued by Steve,
          'I order the Bank to forgive RedKnight's Oligarchy upkeep debt.'
          (http://www.escribe.com/games/agora-business/m9000.html)

          is not a properly-issued Order."
         2/18      Called by Goethe
         2/18-3/2  Assigned to Sir Toby, who defaults
         3/9       Incorrectly assigned to Blob, who is Unready and thus
                     ineligible
         3/9       Assigned to Cecilius
         Caller's argument (summary):  A Rule bug prevents the GWotO from
           obeying the first requirement of Rule 2010.  Issuing this Order is
           the second requirement of Rule 2010.  The Order is valid, but may be
           improper under the circumstances.

CFJ 1439 "Goethe has successfully absolved 1 Blot from emself this Agoran
[TRUE]    week."
         2/20       Called by Goethe
         2/25-3/10  Assigned to root, who Judges TRUE
         Caller's argument (summary):  Prior to the CFJ, in the same message,
           Goethe said something which e claims is "I intend to absolve one of
           my Blots with 0 Support; I absolve one of my Blots with 0 Support"
           in a foreign language.  Prior to that, Goethe had not absolved any
           of eir Blots that week.

CFJ xxxx "Goethe's votes in
          http://www.escribe.com/games/agora-business/m9072.html
are not valid

          votes."
         2/21  Called by OscarMeyr
         2/22  Retracted
         Commentary:  The "votes" were various repetitions of "Güneº", which
           was later confirmed as nothing but an oblique reference to a joke
           that all modern languages descended from this "word".

CFJ 1440 "Proposal 4453 had an Adoption Index of 1."
[TRUE]   2/24   Called by Sherlock
         3/2-8  Assigned to Michael, who Judges TRUE
         3/10   Appealed by RedKnight and OscarMeyr
         Caller's argument (summary):  Sherlock requested AI=3 when submitting
           this Proposal, and AI=1 shortly before the Voting Period ended.
           Either the second request is effective, or the combination of
           requests is ambiguous and neither is effective (which would still
           lead to AI=1 by default).
         Counterargument:  After the request for AI=3, Rule 594 defined and
           required AI=3, and thus triggered its own "value required by the
           Rules" to keep AI=3 following the request for AI=1.

CFJ 1441 "London is the capital of England."
DISMISS  2/26   Called by Peekee
         3/2-8  Assigned to RedKnight, who dismisses it
         Caller's argument (summary):  This CFJ is intended to test (a) whether
           an arbitrary statement becomes relevant to the Rules simply because
           it is CFJed, and (b) whether this particular statement becomes
           relevant to the Rules because of its role in (a).

CFJ 1442 "Rubberstamping with 0 support is not a dependent action."
[TRUE]   Linked to CFJs 1443, 1444, 1445
         3/1  Called by Maud
         3/9  Assigned to Peekee, who Judges TRUE
         Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1728 defines a dependent action as
           an action with N support or without N objections, where N is a
           positive integer.  Zero is not a positive integer.

CFJ 1443 "The rules regulate rubberstamping proposals."
[TRUE]   Linked to CFJs 1442, 1444, 1445
         3/1  Called by Maud
         3/9  Assigned to Peekee, who Judges TRUE
         Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1986 regulates it.

CFJ 1444 "A player cannot perform an action with 0 support."
[FALSE]  Linked to CFJs 1442, 1443, 1445
         3/1     Called by Maud
         3/9-10  Assigned to Peekee, who Judges FALSE
         Caller's argument (summary):  Performing an action with 0 support has
           no natural meaning.  It has a meaning implied by Rule 1728, but
           since it is not a dependent action, Rule 1728 does not permit it.
           No other Rule permits it, either.
         Judge's refutation (summary):  Game custom gives "performing an action
           with 0 support" a meaning - namely, the same as a dependent action,
           but without the requirement of support - and this procedure is
           unregulated, so Players may use it.

CFJ 1445 "Cecilius's first attempt on 1 March, 2003 to rubberstamp a proposal
[FALSE]   failed."
         Linked to CFJs 1442, 1443, 1444
         3/1     Called by Maud
         3/9-10  Assigned to Peekee, who Judges FALSE
         3/10    Appealed by Eris
         Caller's argument (summary):  Cecilius made this attempt with 0
           Support, so the statement follows directly from that of CFJ 1444.
         Judge's refutation (summary):  Cecilius's attempt depended on whether
           e could perform an action with 0 support.
         Commentary:  Cecilius's attempt occurred on March 1 by eir time zone
           (GMT-0500), but March 2 by Agoran time (GMT+0000).

CFJ 1446 "The Proposal 'Try Again, Part 1 of 3' is distributable."
         Linked to CFJ 1447
         3/2  Called by Murphy
         3/9  Assigned to Cecilius
         Caller's argument (summary):  Murphy claimed to rubberstamp, without
           specifying a method.  Later, e claimed that e had done it by paying
           a Fee of 0 Papyri.  During the week in which e claimed to
           rubberstamp, e had not previously rubberstamped anything.

CFJ 1447 "The Proposal 'Try Again, Part 2 of 3' is distributable."

         3/2  Called by Murphy
         3/9  Assigned to Cecilius
         Caller's argument (summary):  Murphy claimed to rubberstamp by paying
           a Fee of 0 Papyri.  During the week in which e made this claim, e
           had not previously rubberstamped anything.

CFJ 1448 "The Proposal entitled 'Full Discretion Fix' was Rubberstamped by a

          'Rubberstamping, Take Two'."
         Linked to CFJ 1449
         3/3     Called by Cecilius
         3/9-11  Assigned to Goethe, who proto-Judges FALSE
         Judge's refutation (summary):  A Fee of zero still requires announcing
           the purpose of the Fee.  Cecilius did not do so; e merely said
           "Having paid the required fee...".

CFJ 1449 "The Proposal entitled 'Full Discretion Fix' would have been
          Rubberstamped by the message sent by Cecilius today under the

         3/9-11  Assigned to Goethe, who proto-Judges FALSE
         Judge's refutation (summary):  A Fee of zero still requires announcing
           the purpose of the Fee.  Cecilius did not do so; e merely said
           "Having paid the required fee...".

CFJ 1450 "A fee may be paid by announcement."
[TRUE]   3/4  Called by Maud
         3/9  Assigned to Sherlock
         Caller's argument (summary):  ...by sending the transfer and reason
           to the Public Forum, not just to the Recordkeepor.

CFJ xxxx "If the Rules specify a fee of 0 units of a Currency, then an entity
          must transfer at least a single instance of that currency to the Bank

CFJ 1451 "Peekee has published a message containing the text 'MessageXX', in

         Linked to CFJ 1452
         3/6  Called by Peekee
         3/9  Assigned to root
         Commentary:  This CFJ is intended to determine whether a message can
           span multiple e-mail messages, as specified by a later message.

CFJ 1452 "Peekee has published a message containing the text 'This is a single
          message', in emails with titles A and B."

         3/6  Called by Peekee
         3/9  Assigned to root
         Commentary:  This CFJ is intended to determine whether a message can
           span multiple e-mail messages, as specified by a later message.

CFJ 1453 "As a result of the formation of root's Pay Out Scam Contest (rPOSC),
          the Bank incurred a debt to root consisting of one or more
          properties."
         3/4   Called by root
         3/10  Assigned to t
         Caller's argument (summary):  The Contest required root to pay out
           Property to emself, and Rule 1594 (Violation of SLCs) requires em
           to obey the Regulations.  Since Rule 1594 requires em to pay out
           Property, Rule 1479 (Definition of "Pay Out" and "Bill") causes the
           Bank to incur a debt.

CFJ 1454 "New York is the capital of England."
         3/9  Called by Peekee
         Caller's argument (summary):  This CFJ is intended to test (a) whether
           an arbitrary statement becomes relevant to the Rules simply because
           it is CFJed, and (b) whether this particular statement becomes
           relevant to the Rules because of its role in (a).

CFJ 1455 "Sir Toby did not join The Evil Scam Contest in a message sent to
          agora-business on Fri, 14 Mar 2003 08:53:40 -0800, with the
          following subject: This message brought to you by the letter 'a'."
         3/14  Called by Sir Toby
         Caller's argument (summary):  The Regulations of The Evil Scam Contest
           deem messages containing the letter 'a' to be requests to join, but
           this did not apply to Sir Toby because e was a non-Contestant and
           thus outside the jurisdiction of the Regulations.
