ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

<no title> by Murphy - Proposal 4411 - Sanitised and Aborted 10/28 - Proposal
    4413 adopted 11/15
  Eris is Installed as Electee to Clerk of the Courts.

  All Frozen Players become Inactive.
  A Player must wait one week before changing eir Activity Level in either
    direction.
  Silence triggers a Notice of Abandonment, sent to all Public Fora and to the
    Player's preferred e-mail address.  If the Notice is still valid one month
    later, then the Player is deregistered.
  Silence due to Quietness takes one month (up from two weeks).
  Silence due to Inactivity takes three months (up from two).
  Inactive Players may be bound by the requirements of eir Organizations.

    Oligarchy - Proposal 4405 adopted 10/23
  Movement Units are renamed to Action Units.
  Players have 10 Action Units per week, minus 1 per 5 Blots.
  Groups have 1 Action Unit per week, plus 3 per member at the same or
    adjacent Location as the Group.
  Players may only move to adjacent Units (as they currently do).
  Groups may only move to the Location of a member (5 Action Units).
  Groups may impose Tolls.
  [A duplicate copy submitted on 10/12 is ignored, per Rule 1483.]

"Agoran Nomic" by harvel - Proposal 4398 adopted 10/23

  In Private Auctions, bidders with the same Executor as the Auctioneer may bid
    only in the first 72 hours of the Auction, and must bid/cancel publicly.

"Criminal Reform" by Murphy - Proposal 4406 adopted 10/30
  ASAP is changed from a cascading requirement to a straight definition.
  Rule 1553 (Officer Transition) loses the text "violates this Rule", since it
    already defines a Crime.
  Rules 1724 (Urgent Proposals), 1770 (Distributing Proposals), and 1827
    (Granting or Denying Motions) lose the concept "detect and report", which
    has elsewhere been shortened to "report".
  Sentencing Orders penalize Crimes; Ticketing Orders penalize Infractions;
    they shall be necessary and sufficient to apply the penalty.
  A Judge may (Without Objection) substitute a Formal Apology for the
    Sentencing Orders of any Crime.
  Players are encouraged to CFJ on Infractions only when a question of
    interpretation, rather than fact, arises.
  If a Sentencing or Ticketing Order for Blots is recorded and then vacated,
    then the Blots are expunged.
  Violating a Rule (in the absence of any other penalty) is the Class N Crime
    of Disobedience.  N is the Power of the violated Rule, but at most 4.
  Violating a SLC (unless necessary to avoid violating the Rules or another SLC
    with precedence) is the Class 1 Crime of Insubordination.
  Violating a SLC may only be CFJed by a Player within its Jurisdiction, and
    may only be Judged by a Player outside its Jurisdiction.

    Oligarchy - Proposal 4424 adopted 12/16
  Only Active Noisy Players may be made Quiet.
  Any Inactive Players who became Quiet within the previous month become Noisy.
  Inactive Players cannot become eligible to Judge.

"Quorum on Parliamentary Proposals" by Steve - Proposal 4410 adopted 11/6
  A Parliamentary Proposal meets Quorum if and only if it would have met Quorum
    as a Democratic Proposal, based on the Player "Votes" rather than the
    Estate Votes.

"Real Majorities" by Steve - Proposal 4412 adopted 11/6
  Adopting a Proposal requires a Voting Index greater than 1.  (In other words,
    an AI=1 Proposal fails if FOR and AGAINST Votes are tied.)

"Reinstate the Points penalty for Crimes" by OscarMeyr - Proposal 4395 failed
    Quorum 10/16 - Complacent Oligarchy - Proposal 4408 adopted 10/30
  The Points penalty for Crimes is made part of the penalty in Rule 1505
    (Standard Classes of Crimes and Infractions).  Currently, the Points
    penalty is prevented by Rule 1816 (No Double Jeopardy for Crimes).

"Resolve Collision on R1505" by OscarMeyr - Proposal 4416 adopted 11/15
  Amend Rule 1505 (Standard Classes of Crimes and Infractions) to combine the
    Points penalty of Proposal 4408 with the general changes of Proposal 4406.

"Sensible Timing for Indulgence Auctions" by Murphy - Proposal 4417 failed
    Quorum 12/4 - Complacent Oligarchy - Proposal 4423 adopted 12/16

    Complacent Oligarchy - Proposal 4425 adopted 1/3

"End Tax Avoidance" by Steve - Proposal 4421 rejected 12/16

"General Rules Cleanup" by Maud
  Rules 1020 (Name Is Agora) and 1698 (The Proposal System Is Protected) are
    merged into Rule 101 (Obey the Rules).
  References to the Initial Set of Rules are repealed.

    Surcharge (part of the Promotor's Budget) to the Bank.
  A Player who ceases to be a Scribe ceases to be Rubbery.

    Support, or Without 0 Objections.

"Monastery" by RedKnight

"Monks" by Maud
  See Proto-Proposal "Switches".
  An on-off switch is a switch with two states.
  Readiness is a Player switch.
  Activity Level is a Player switch.
  Noisiness is an automatic Player switch.
  Political Status is a Player switch.
  Chamber is a Proposal switch.
  Role is a Player switch.
  Monk is a Role.
  A Player is Ascetic iff e possesses no Property, is Immaculate, and holds
    Executorship only of emself.
  No one may transfer Property to a Monk.  (If a Monk somehow receives
    Property, then e is billed for it, and does not lose eir Asceticism.)
  A Monk may only transfer Property to the Bank.
  As soon as possible after a Player becomes a Monk, each Property
    Recordkeepor shall bill em for eir holdings.
  A Monk must become Ascetic within two weeks and stay that way, or else e
    loses eir Role and may not gain a Role for two weeks.
  N,k,c default to 1,0,1 respectively.
  An N,k,c-collective Role-based power may be exercised with (X+k)^N Support
    from other Players of the same Role, or by paying a Fee of c*(X+k)^N of
    the Currency associated with the Role.  (X is the number of times e has
    previously exercised it that week.)
  An N-reflexive Role-based power may be exercised with N Support from other
    Players of the same Role.
  An N-symmetric Role-based power for two Roles may be exercised by a Player
    of either Role, with N Support from other Players of the other Role.
  A Monk may 2-collectively rubberstamp a Proposal (but no longer gets a
    discount on Distribution Fee, since e shouldn't have Property anyway).
  A Monk may 2,1-collectively pay out an Indulgence to a non-Monk.
  Distributability is an on-off Proposal switch.
  Monks do not get Minimum Income.

"Non-Player entities are stainless steel" by Murphy
  Only persons may gain or lose Blots.

"Ought, or can, 'ought' imply 'can'?" by Steve
  No Player shall be punished for doing something e was required to do, or
    failing to do something it was illegal for em to do.

"Pragmatize Judicial Re-Eligibility" by Murphy
  Ineligibility by request does not automatically expire after one month, but
    may be cancelled after one month by the Clerk of the Courts, by informing
    the Player.

"Q*Bert" by OscarMeyr
  Purple is a Land Type.
  Each week, Q*Bert hops in a random diagonal direction (unless it and another
    entity end the week at the same Location, in which case it hops in a random
    orthogonal direction).  It never reverses its previous direction.
  If Q*Bert would leave the Map, then it ceases to have a Location, and moves
    to (0,0) the next week.
  Q*Bert has a color (initially Purple).
  Q*Bert changes its destination's Type to match its color, unless they already
    match, in which case it changes its destination's Type to the Type with
    Sente.
  If Q*Bert has Sente, then its color becomes a random Land Type other than
    Aether or its old color.
  Q*Bert is controlled by the Mapkeepor.
  Failing to move Q*Bert for two weeks in a row is the Class 1 Infraction of
    Failing to Cue Bert.

"Rouse the Rabble" by Murphy
  If an Election fails Quorum, then each eligible Player who did not Vote or
    declare Presence commits the Class 1 Infraction of Apathy.

"Satellite Forecast" by Murphy
  Weather calculations are based on the beginning of the month, rather than
    the time of calculation.

"Shift the Balance of Power" by Murphy
  Weather calculations are performed by the Payroll Clerk, not the Treasuror.

"Switches" by Maud
  A player-tracked entity is what it sounds like.
  A switch is a set of states that some class of entities may have, possibly
    including null, with a default.
  An instance of a switch always has exactly one possible state, and initially
    has the default state.
  Non-automatic switches are modified by public announcement.
  Automatic switches are modified as specified by the Rules.
  Publicity status (Public, Discussion, null) is an automatic Forum switch.
  Readiness is a Player switch.
  Activity Level is a Player switch.
  Noisiness is an automatic Player switch.
  Roles are a Player switch.
  Office-holders are an Office switch (values = Players, default = Speaker).
  Possible new switches:
    * Electees
    * Dependent Actions
    * Political Status
    * Periodic Compensations
    * Oligarchs
    * Definition of Proposals
    * Proposal - Power, Disinterested, Distributable, Chamber
    * Indices
    * Voting
    * Parliamentary Votes
    * Modes of Voting
    * Power of New Rules
    * Classes of Orders

"The Noise in the Attic" by Sir Toby
  Oerjan becomes Noisy.

"The Wormhole" by Peekee
  Each month, the Mapkeepor selects a random Land Unit other than (0, 0) or
    any Land Unit Adjacent to it.  The Wormhole makes that Land Unit Adjacent
    to (0, 0).

[FALSE]  10/10     Called by Goethe; Linked to CFJs 1416 and 1417
         10/18-25  Assigned to Michael, who Judges FALSE
         Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1989 says that each Player is eir
           own Prime Executor, and so Rule 1016 applies.
         Judge's refutation (summary):  Rule 1989 says what Players are, not
           what Players may do.

CFJ 1416 "A Frozen Player may transfer Property."
[FALSE]  10/10     Called by Goethe; Linked to CFJs 1415 and 1417
         10/18-25  Assigned to Michael, who Judges FALSE
         Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1598 permits entities (not just
           Players) to transfer Property.
         Judge's refutation (summary):  The transfer must be performed by a
           Player (possibly on behalf of another entity).

CFJ 1417 "A Frozen Player who is a Member of a Contest may perform Actions
[TRUE]    explicitly allowed to Contestants by that Contest's Regulations."
         10/10     Called by Goethe; Linked to CFJs 1415 and 1416
         10/18-25  Assigned to Michael, who Judges TRUE
         Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1016 only applies to actions
           allowed by the Rules, not by the Regulations of a Contest.

CFJ 1418 "If, after the end of an Election's Nominating Period, the Vote
[TRUE]    Collector fails to publish a list of Candidates as soon as
          possible, then the Election has no Winner - even if there was
          exactly one Candidate at the end of the Nominating Period."
         10/25    Called by Murphy
         11/4-12  Assigned to t, who Judges TRUE
         Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1445 says "fail to publish ASAP
           -> no winner" before it says "depending on number of Candidates,
           winner is _____".

CFJ 1419 "Steve did not lose, on or about December 6, 2002, eir right to
[TRUE]    purchase an Indulgence by paying the debt arising from eir bid
          in the Indulgence Auction initiated on or about November 3, 2002."

                      unanimously move to overturn and remand
         12/31-1/8  Remanded to RedKnight, who Judges TRUE
         Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1887(n) says "e commits the Class 2
           Infraction of Defaulting... and thereafter loses eir right", but
           Steve has not been convicted of Defaulting.
         Judge's argument (summary):  Rule 459 gives Steve until the end of the
           Agoran week to pay the debt.  (The first Judgement of FALSE was due
           to overlooking the negative in the Statement.)
