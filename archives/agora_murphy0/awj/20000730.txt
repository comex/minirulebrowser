ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Excess Baggage II" by Elysion - Proposal 4031 adopted 7/24
   An obsolete reference to Blots is removed from Rule 1445 (Defaults
     for Elections).

"Powerfix(2)" by t - Proposal 4032 adopted 7/24

   For Democratic Proposals, the maximum Voting Power of Oligarchs
     is lower than that of non-Oligarchs.
   Non-Players have zero Voting Power except as specified by the Rules.
   Groups with at least three Players have a Voting Power of (one plus
     eir number of VEs), with a maximum of three.

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Adjust Terms of Service" by Murphy
   Officers' Terms expire on the 15th of the month, not the 1st.  This
     is intended to cause Elections to end near the beginning/end of a
     month, rather than the middle.  (If they end near the middle, then
     a few days' delay can change whether the old or the new holder gets
     the Salary for that month.)

"Cleanup of Dismissals" by Murphy
   DISMISSED is a Judgement.
   Reasons for dismissal are Pragmatized and made non-redundant.

"COE fix" by Taral
   The requirement to respond to a COE is suspended while the COE is
     disputed via CFJ.

"Fix Patronage" by Chuck - Proposal 4033
   The Speaker pays out Patronage, rather than transferring it directly
     (which e cannot do).

"Fix Rule 1614" by harvel
   Amend Rule 1614 (Organizations' Names) by removing the word "either",
     which is left over from a previous version of the Rule.

"Minor Speaker Reforms" by Elysion
   A Tainted Speaker cannot change a Proposal from Ordinary to Democratic.
   Move the Registrar and Rulekeepor up in the Order of Succession.  Move
     the Justiciar and CotC down, since those Offices are lost when one
     becomes Speaker.

"My Votes Are My Own" by Chuck - Proposal 4035
   If a Nominee Stands Down, anyone who Voted for em may Vote again (but,
     in case e does not do so, is deemed to have declared Presence).

"One-shot rule cleanup" by Taral
   Repeal Rules 1943 and 1949, both of which were one-time-use Rules to
     maintain consistency of entities through the adoption of Property.

"Papyri" by t
   Papyri are a Bank Currency, tracked by the Promotor, and paid to
     get Proposals distributed.
   A Proposal's Distribution Cost is 1; +1 if Urgent, +1 if Sane (each
     Player may Vote at most once; no non-Player may Vote).
   While Disinterested, a Proposal is always Distributable.
   Interested Proposals start as Undistributable.  Any Player may pay
     a Proposal's Distribution Cost in Slotten to make it Distributable,
     or twice its Distribution Cost in Slotten to make it Undistributable.
   The Current Batch contains all Distributable Proposals.
   The Promotor chooses how many Papyri to Auction each month, but must
     Auction at least one.  If there are at least three Winners other than
     emself, then e may pay out to emself Stems equal to the Winning Bid.
   New Players get one Papyrus, plus one Papyrus per Interested Proposal
     adopted during eir Grace Period.
   Each non-Zombie Player gets one Papyrus when this Proposal is adopted.

"Probate Removal" by Peekee
   Two obsolete references to Probate are removed.

"Remove Proposal Number Reference from R1770" by Chuck - Proposal 4034
   An obsolete reference to Proposal numbers (now deregulated) is removed
     from Rule 1770 (Distributing Proposals).

"Simplify Organizations" by Oerjan
   Groups and Contests are replaced with Political and non-Political
     Organizations.
   Executor and SLC Maintainer may both be different from Administrator
     (but are the same by default).
   To become Political, an Organization must have at least three Members,
     and none of its Members may belong to another Political Organization.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Bluff Auctions" by Blob
   Cards are Properties corresponding to a normal 52-card deck.
   A Player may buy a random Card for 10 Stems.
   A Player may, with the Support of a Player holding four or more Cards,
     call for a Redeal.  This returns all Cards to the Deck, then gives
     each entity the same number of (random) Cards as it had before.
   Bluff Auctions are conducted by the Dealor.  Each bid is accompanied
     by a Hand of one or more Cards, transferred to the Pile.  Upon the
     end of such an auction, all non-winning Bids become payable.

"Fix Property" by Murphy
   Only entities defined as Property are Property.

"Let Non-Players Hold Office" by harvel
   An Office may be held by a non-Player if the Rule defining it
     explicitly says so.
   The Distributor is made an Office.

"Respect for the dead" by Peekee
   Wills are re-defined, and the Notary may carry them out as e sees fit
     when handling Abandoned Property.

"Secret, Unknown and Hidden Proposals" by Peekee
   Secret Proposals have Priority Cost +1, and their Priority is secret
     till Distribution.  (Billing for Priority changes is delayed till
     the Proposal leaves the Queue.  If the Proposal re-enters the
     Queue, all such debts are forgiven.)
   Unknown Proposals have Priority Cost +1, and their text may be kept
     secret till Distribution.
   Hidden Proposals have Priority Cost +1, and their existence in the
     Proposal Queue is secret till Distribution.  (However, they must
     still be Proposed publicly, unless also Secret; and have their
     Priority increased publicly, unless also Unknown.)


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1234  "Kudos are Property."
[TRUE]    7/19     Called by Murphy
Appealed  7/20-27  Assigned to Kelly, who Judges TRUE
           7/27-28  Appealed by Steve, Palnatoke, and Peekee
           7/29     Appeal assigned to lee, Taral, and Wes.
           7/30     lee and Taral both move to sustain
           Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1062 says that Players
             possess Kudos.  Rule 1942 defines any entity possessible
             by another Player as Property.

CFJ 1235  "Peekee has not been awarded the Patent Title of Quack."
[TRUE]    7/20     Called by Oerjan
           7/20-25  Assigned to lee, who Judges TRUE

CFJ 1236  "Zombies are not rewarded Indulgences for being Immaculate all
[FALSE]    Quarter."
           7/21     Called by Peekee
           7/24-30  Assigned to Murphy, who Judges FALSE
           Caller's argument (summary):  Zombies cannot read, and are thus
             not covered by the "y'all" in Rule 1924.
           Judge's refutation (summary):  Zombies are (very inactive)
             Players, and thus can read.  The intent of Rule 1924's Zombie
             Upkeep is to counteract the fact that Zombies usually *are*
             Immaculate all Quarter, and thus are rewarded Indulgences.

CFJ 1237  "The Order issued by Chuck on Sun, 23 Jul 2000 17:17:02 -0500
[FALSE]    was valid."
           7/25     Called by Taral
           7/26-27  Assigned to Oerjan, who Judges FALSE
           7/30     Taral moves that Chuck be Ordered to pay the Bank 24
                      P-Notes, the amount that Chuck received as a result
                      of the Order in question.
           Caller's argument for FALSE (summary):  Chuck transferred some
             P-Notes for the purpose of paying a Fee.  The P-Note payment
             succeeded, but the Fee payment failed.  The Rules do not
             require that Players be reimbursed for failed Fee payments.
             Rule 1796 permits the validity of Chuck's Order to be proven
             by CFJ only if its execution is required by the Rules.
           Counterargument:  Rule 1796 also permits the validity of the
             Order to be proven by CFJ if its execution is "permitted in"
             the circumstances existing when it was executed.
