ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"10 GOTO 10" by OscarMeyr - Proposal 4530 adopted 10/26
   The Scorekeepor's correct announcement of a Team Win resets Team Scores,
     as well as Player Scores.

   The Notary's monthly report includes the charter of each organization
     (in case some of them also have other SLCs).

"Clean Up Oligarchy Removal" by OscarMeyr - Proposal 4532 adopted 10/26
   Requirements to remove Oligarchs are separated from the method of removing
     Oligarchs.
   (Partly ineffective due to typos in Rule numbers.)

   Fee-based actions are performed (even if the actor has insufficient Kudos)
     unless a correct challenge is made.

"Fix Proposal 4514" by root - Proposal 4519 failed quorum 7/29 - Complacent
     Oligarchy - Proposal 4524 adopted 8/28
   The Duty to Vote may be satisfied by declaring presence.

"Mornington Crescent" by Murphy - Proposal 4518 failed quorum 7/29 -
     Complacent Oligarchy - Proposal 4523 adopted 8/28
   Intentional duplicate of Proposal 4500.
   See also "Round the Bend".
   Each Player may effectively vote separately on each section.  (All sections
     were effective.)
   Convert Activity, Noisiness, Role, Readiness, Orthodoxy
     (Abiding/Rebellious), and Orientation (Turning Around and Around) into
     player switches.
   Convert Depth (Distributable/Undistributable) and Interest into proposal
     switches.

"Nameless Proposal" by root - Proposal 4531 adopted 10/26
   Repeal Rule 2031 (Money Grubbing Contests), which are pointless now that
     Stems have been repealed.

"Round the Bend" by Murphy - Proposal 4527 adopted 9/16
   Duplicate of portions of "Mornington Crescent" which were ineffective due
     to insufficient Adoption Index.
   Viscosity is no longer a switch.
   Recordkeeping for a class of entities and a switch for that class may be
     assigned to different players.
   Convert Activity and Orthodoxy into switches.

"Voting Potential fix" by Steve - Proposal 4526 adopted 9/8
   The cost of increasing one's Voting Potential is proportional to the
     magnitude of the increase, rather than the final value.

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

"Four Score" by Goethe - Contested Proposal 4529 rejected 10/16

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Boon of Zeitgeist" by Murphy
   The Boon of Zeitgeist is given to the author of an Interested Democratic
     Proposal that is adopted with no AGAINST votes.

"Clean Up Oligarchy Removal, take 2" by OscarMeyr - Proposal 4534
   Duplicate of portions of "Clean Up Oligarchy Removal" which were
     ineffective due to typos in Rule numbers.
   Rule 1936 and 1963 no longer specify how to remove Oligarchs, which is now
     covered by Rule 2058; they only specify when to do it.

"Good Enough for Government Work" by Murphy
   Fugitive Blots are rounded up to the nearest integer after the monthly
     halving.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"A Little Bribe Never Hurt Anyone" by Murphy
   Advertising is a stuck proposal switch with values none, positive, negative.
   A player may pay 2 Kudos to flip it from none to another value, or vice
     versa.
   If a player votes in line with a proposal's advertising, e gains 5 points.
   If a team votes unanimously in line with a proposal's advertising, they
     gain 10 points.  (Mixed votes, e.g. F+A from one member, are allowed.)

"Correcting Judgements" by root
   A judge may change eir judgement, once, if:
     * The original was on time, and has never been under appeal.
     * The change occurs within 72 hours of the original.
   Using this just to prolong the effective Deliberation Period (by submitting
     a random judgement, then correcting it if needed) is the Crime of
     Postponing Judgement.

"Fix Budget Bug" by Murphy
   Proto-Budget handling is tied to the end of the nominating period and the
     end of the election, rather than the voting period (since uncontested
     elections don't have a voting period).

"Fix Oligarchy Terms" by Murphy
   Term expiration is added to the laundry list of reasons to remove an
     Oligarch.  This list also allows other Rules to state their own reasons.
   The Speaker-Elect may be an Oligarch.

"No Corrupt Judges" by root
   Judicial Orders not directly pertaining to the subject of the CFJ are
     invalid.

"Patch Murphy's Loophole" by OscarMeyr
   When a player leaves the Oligarchy, e becomes ineligible to rejoin for 30
     days.

"Pragmatize Scoring" by Murphy
   Point awards from the Scorekeepor's Budget are pragmatically validated
     unless correctly challenged within 7 days.

"The Omnibus Reform Act of 2003" by Murphy
   Orders cannot pile onto an already-required (in)action.
   The Scorekeepor's Budget treats Ephemeral Patent Titles differently.
   The Gamestate is retroactively fixed with respect to Boons of Teamwork in
     October.
   Player and Team Scores reset pragmatically only.
   One Team Win blocks any other concurrent Team Wins.
   Proto-Budget handling is tied to the end of the nominating period and the
     end of the election, rather than the voting period (since uncontested
     elections don't have a voting period).  The Gamestate is retroactively
     repaired as if this bug never prevented a Proto-Budget from taking effect.
   The Gamestate is retroactively fixed with respect to Oligarchic Terms of
     Service.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

*** Rule 1567 causes ineligibility by request to expire after one month ***

9/30   RedKnight requests to be ineligible to judge CFJs pertaining to Kudos.

        CFJ 1462 causes all turned players become unturned.

        Pakaran requests to be ineligible to judge CFJs made while an odd
          number of the following are true ("I" = Pakaran):
              I. I have, as of the sending of this message, spent an odd
                 number of cents in my life on coffee.
             II. There exists a problem solvable in nondeterministic
                 polynomial time but not in deterministic polynomial time.
            III. My blood type is O negative.
             IV. I like beer.
              V. There are fewer people in the world with red hair at the
                 time I send this message than there were 24 hours before.

10/11  Pakaran cancels eir request for ineligibility.

10/12  Blob's recusal from CFJ 1462 makes em ineligible to judge further CFJs.

10/16  CFJ 1479 causes all turned players become unturned.

10/21  Goethe makes emself ineligible to judge all CFJs that e has been
          assigned to judge, then cancels this request and makes emself
          ineligible to judge all CFJs.

10/30  RedKnight's request for ineligibility expires.

11/1   Peekee's recusal from Appeal 1474a makes em ineligible to judge further
          CFJs.

CFJ 1322  "The Player, former Player, or Dissolute Blob has at least one
[FALSE]    Blot."
           9/19/01   Called by Goethe
           9/20/01   Assigned to Oerjan, who judges FALSE
           10/27/03  Appealed by Goethe
           Commentary:  Oerjan judged false because Rule 1435 said that only
             Players had Blots, and Blob was deregistered.  Rule 1437 requires
             the Herald to continue tracking the Blots of Fugitives.  This CFJ
             was not appealed because the Herald's Report (omitting the claimed
             Blots) was ratified shortly afterward anyway, and was ratified
             again in November 2002 and July 2003.  However, ratification
             outside of proposals may have been broken at these times.

CFJ 1462  "The Oligarchy Charge Requirement, as defined by the Grand Warden
[TRUE]     of the Oligarchy's Budget, is 6."
           9/29      Called by root
           10/3-12   Assigned to Blob, who defaults
           10/12-16  Assigned to Sir Toby, who judges TRUE
           Caller's argument (summary):  Proto-Budgets take effect at the end
             of the voting period, but GWotO OscarMeyr was elected without
             competition and thus without a voting period.

CFJ 1463  "Pakaran is presently eligible to judge one or more CFJs."
DISMISS   9/30    Called by Pakaran
           10/3-9  Assigned to OscarMeyr, who dismisses it
           10/3    OscarMeyr orders Pakaran to submit evidence related to I,
                     II, III, and IV in eir request for ineligibility
           10/9    OscarMeyr orders Pakaran to clarify eir eligibility such
                     that reasonable effort suffices to resolve it
           Commentary:  This immediately followed Pakaran's request to be
             ineligible to judge certain CFJs.
           Judge's argument (summary):  III and IV are false.  I, II, and V
             are indeterminate.

CFJ 1464  "RedKnight sucessfuly entered the Oligarchy through at least one
[TRUE]     of the above statements."
           9/30     Called by RedKnight
           10/5-6   Assigned to Michael, who transfers jurisdiction to Eris
           10/6-15  Assigned to Eris, who judges TRUE
           Commentary:  RedKnight had 9 Kudos and announced "I pay 4 Kudos to
             enter the Oligarchy", followed by "I pay 6 Kudos to enter the
             Oligarchy".  This was intended to test the Proto-Budget bug
             addressed by CFJ 1462.
           Judge's argument (summary):  Fee-based actions only require the
             existence of a Fee, not its correct amount, to be announced.

CFJ 1465  "If a player attempts to spend N kudos to pay a fee, but the
DISMISS    fee-based action fails (e.g. the fee is larger than N), then the
            kudos are still spent."
           Linked to CFJs 1466 - 1470
           10/5     Called by Murphy
           10/6-15  Assigned to Eris, who dismisses it
           Judge's argument (summary):  Fee-based actions only require the
             existence of a Fee, not its correct amount, to be announced.

CFJ 1466  "If a player attempts to spend N kudos to pay a fee, but the fee
[TRUE]     is smaller than N, then the fee-based action succeeds (assuming
            it is not otherwise prohibited)."
           Linked to CFJs 1465 and 1467 - 1470
           10/5     Called by Murphy
           10/6-15  Assigned to Eris, who judges TRUE
           Judge's argument (summary):  See CFJ 1465.

CFJ 1467  "If a player attempts to spend N kudos to pay a fee, but the fee
[FALSE]    is smaller than N, then N kudos are still paid."
           Linked to CFJs 1465 - 1466 and 1468 - 1470
           10/5     Called by Murphy
           10/6-15  Assigned to Eris, who judges FALSE
           Judge's argument (summary):  See CFJ 1465.  The amount paid equals
             the actual amount, not the announced amount (if any).

CFJ 1468  "A player may perform multiple fee-based actions (e.g. extending
[FALSE]    eir Oligarchic Term of Service by the Oligarchic Term twice) by
            announcing the net effect of those actions."
           Linked to CFJs 1465 - 1467 and 1469 - 1470
           10/5     Called by Murphy
           10/6-15  Assigned to Eris, who judges FALSE
           Judge's argument (summary):  Each fee-based action requires a
             separate announcement of the existence of a fee.

CFJ 1469  "A player may perform multiple fee-based actions by paying a
[FALSE]    single amount of kudos equal to the total fees for those
            actions."
           Linked to CFJs 1465 - 1468 and 1470
           10/5     Called by Murphy
           10/6-15  Assigned to Eris, who judges FALSE
           10/17    Appealed by Murphy
           10/19    Appealed by root
           Judge's argument (summary):  See CFJ 1468.

CFJ 1470  "If a player attempts to perform multiple fee-based actions by
[TRUE]     paying a single amount of kudos, but one of the actions fails,
            then they all fail."
           Linked to CFJs 1465 - 1469
           10/5     Called by Murphy
           10/6-15  Assigned to Eris, who judges TRUE
           10/17    Appealed by Murphy
           Judge's argument (summary):  See CFJ 1468.  They all fail because
             paying a single amount of kudos does not satisfy the requirement
             of a separate announced fee for each fee-based action.

CFJ 1471  "The GWotO is allowed to remove from the Oligarchy an Oligarch
[TRUE]     whose term of service has expired."
           10/5  Called by OscarMeyr
           10/6  Assigned to Steve, who judges TRUE
           Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1936 (Oligarchic Service)
             requires the removal and provides a method (announcement).
           Commentary:  Oligarchic removal due to unpaid upkeep was required
             by Rule 2010 (Oligarchy Upkeep), which lost a precedence conflict
             to Rule 1963 (Eligible Oligarchs).  However, Rule 1963 now
             explicitly defers to other Rules attempting to remove Oligarchs
             (and would lose a precedence conflict to Rule 1936 anyway,
             whenever Rule 1936 explicitly specified an aspect of removal).

CFJ 1472  "There is a Points Contest named Eris' Contest."
[TRUE]    Linked to CFJs 1473 - 1474
           10/7      Called by root
           10/12-17  Assigned to RedKnight, who judges TRUE

CFJ 1473  "There was a Points Contest named Eris' Contest at the beginning
[FALSE]    of the month of October."
           Linked to CFJs 1472 and 1474
           10/7      Called by root
           10/12-17  Assigned to RedKnight, who judges FALSE
           Judge's argument (summary):  The Application to Create an
             Organization was not published until after the beginning of
             October.

CFJ 1474  "A Points Contest named Eris' Contest has awarded a positive
[TRUE]     number of points to some player during the month of October."
Appealed  Linked to CFJs 1472 - 1473
           10/7      Called by root
           10/12-17  Assigned to RedKnight, who judges TRUE
           10/17     Appealed by Murphy, Sir Toby, and root
           10/17     Appeal assigned to Eris, Peekee, and Steve
           10/19     Steve moves to overturn and remand
           10/19     Eris moves to overturn and remand
           11/1      Peekee is recused
           11/1      Appeal assigned to Sherlock
           Judge's argument (summary):  Eris' Contest did not exist until
             after the beginning of October, so it cannot award points during
             October.

CFJ 1475  "The above message contains a valid Notice of Award."
[TRUE]    10/15  Called by Goethe
           10/15  Assigned to Murphy, who judges TRUE
           Caller's argument (summary):  The point awards do not exceed the
             maximums allowed by the Rules.

CFJ 1476  "Oerjan is silent."
[TRUE]    10/15  Called by Murphy
           10/15  Assigned to Goethe, who judges TRUE

CFJ 1477  "Team Dovesdar has achieved a Team Win within the past 24 hours."
[FALSE]   10/15     Called by Murphy
           10/15-26  Assigned to Pakaran, who judges FALSE

CFJ 1478  "A is A."
DISMISS   10/17  Called by Murphy
           10/17  Assigned to root, who dismisses it
           10/17  root makes and grants 100 motions for Judicial Orders for
                    each of the following, and later vacates them all:
                      * Assessor Murphy to publish the Voting Report for
                          Proposal 4529 within 72 hours
                      * Assessor Murphy to publish all valid Point Awards in
                          that message, with Dovesdar and its members first
                      * CotC Murphy not to select any Appellate Judges until
                          after a Team Win has occurred
                      * CotC Murphy not to award any Boons of Wisdom until
                          after a Team Win has occurred
                      * Speaker Goethe not to award any Boons of Gold Star
                          until after a Team Win has occurred
                      * Contestmasters of each Points Contest not to award any
                          Contest Points until after a Team Win has occurred
                      * All other players not to move for any Judicial Orders
                          until after a Team Win has occurred
                      * Rulekeepor Michael to annotate Rule 2029 with the
                          text "Hi, Mom!"
           Commentary:  Judicial Orders do not take effect until published by
             the Clerk of the Courts.
