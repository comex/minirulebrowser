CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1170  "Players that hold official positions can choose to either
[TRUE]     accept or ignore messages sent to a-d which would require
           them to note an action or carry out an action themselves in
           the role of their official position"
          10/14  Judged TRUE by Crito
          Judge's concurrent opinion (summary):  An Officer may choose
            not to subscribe to a-d; e would then fail to receive
            messages sent to a-d.  However, if e receives a message
            sent to a-d or by any other means, e must accept it.
