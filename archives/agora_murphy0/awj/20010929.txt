ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Building Arcadian Cities" by Syllepsis - Proposal 4217 adopted 9/29
  Two units of Land are Connected by a Type (Subtype) if one can travel between
    them by going through only Land of that Type (Subtype).
  A Player who owns eir Location may spend 5 Movement Points and a Fee
    (measured as a multiple of the Basic Officer Salary) to change it:

    From                    To                  Fee
    -------------------     --------            ---
    Wilderness/Forest       Farmland            0.10
    Wilderness/Desert       Farmland            0.25
    Wilderness/Mountain     Farmland            1.00
    Farmland                Urbana/Road         0.10
    Farmland                Urbana/Aqueduct     0.25
    Farmland                Urbana/City         1.00 *

  * Requires:
    a) No units of City within Penguin Distance of 3.
    b) Connected to Water by Aqueduct.
    c) At least 8 units of Farmland within Penguin Distance of 2.
    d) Player must give it a unique name.

  Changes take effect at beginning of next week.
  (0,0) is always the Bank-owned City of Tripolis.
  If b) or c) ceases to be true of a City (other than Tripolis), then it
    becomes a Road.

"Burn Down the Winderness" by neil - Proposal 4215 adopted 9/29
  Amend Rule 2003 by replacing "Winderness" with "Wilderness".

"Land Auctions and Tolls" by neil - Proposal 4210 adopted 9/11
  While less than half the Land in Arcadia is Player-owned, the Mapkeepor shall
    Auction 10 units of non-Aether Land each month (or all of them, if there
    are less than 10).  This is a Vickrey Auction, with Bids in Indulgences.
  A Player may pay 0.2 Indulgences to add a Toll to a unit of eir Land.  The
    amount of the Toll is specified by the Player; it is in exactly one of
    (VEs, Indulgences, Papyri) and is at most 200 times the MUQ.  Any other
    Player who moves there owes this Toll to the owner.
  The Mapkeepor commits the Class 3 Crime of Conspiracy to Commit Highway
    Robbery if e incorrectly confirms a Toll, or the Class 3 Crime of Not
    Feeding the Toll Under the Bridge if e incorrectly denies a Toll.
  A Player may remove a Toll from a unit of eir Land, and eir Toll is
    automatically removed if e ceases to own the Land.
  The Location (0,0) shall be transferred to the Bank.

"Make The CotC's Life Easier" by Taral - Proposal 4213 adopted 9/29
  Ineligiblity to be a Justice is based on ineligibility to be a Judge at the
    time the Board of Appeal is formed, not the time the CFJ was called.

"None Of You Zombies..." by harvel - Proposal 4211 adopted 9/11
  Zombies are repealed.
  Silence causes deregistration.
  Zombie Auctions are replaced by Auctioning the right to Loot the Corpse of
    the Dissolute.  The winner (if any) has one week to do so (and may loot
    Stems); any remaining Property shall be transferred to the Bank.

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

"Breaking the Law" by neil - Proposal 4212 (opposite of Proposal 4209) rejected
    9/11
  A Player is doubly penalized for violating the Rule corresponding to eir
    Location in Arcadia, or committing a Crime or Infraction defined by that
    Rule.

"Fluidify VEs" by Syllepsis - Proposal 4214 rejected 9/29
  A Player Activates a Voting Entitlement by transferring it to the Bank and
    stating that e does so.
  Voting Power on Democratic Proposals is increased by Voting Entitlements
    activated during the current month.
  If there would otherwise be no VE Auction in a month, the Assessor may
    Auction up to half the Bank's net VE gain from transfers that month.
  The Bank shall mint 82.2 VEs.
  All Rule 1946 debts prior to July 2001 are forgiven.
  All other VE holdings and debts are tripled.

"Multiple Mintors" by Syllepsis - Proposal 4216 rejected 9/29
  A Currency may have multiple Mintors.
  The Recordkeepor of a Currency may name a new Mintor (with consent) or revoke
    Mintorship.

"Upholding the Law" by neil - Proposal 4209 rejected 9/11
  A Player is half penalized for violating the Rule corresponding to eir
    Location in Arcadia, or committing a Crime or Infraction defined by that
    Rule.

"The Nobility" by Syllepsis - Proposal 4218 rejected 9/29
  A non-Oligarch's Voting Power on Ordinary Proposals equals the number of
    Cities e owns that are connected by Road to Tripolis.
  A Low Oligarch's VPOP is 1/10 the number of Cities (minimum 1).
  A Medium Oligarch's VPOP is 2/10 the number of Cities (minimum 2).
  A High Oligarch's VPOP is 3/10 the number of Cities (minimum 3).

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Don't Talk About Zombies" by harvel
  Remove dangling Zombie references from Rules 1963 and 1936.

"Fix Multiple Mintors Proposal" by Syllepsis - Proposal 4219
  Amend Rule 1579 as intended by Proposal 4216 (Multiple Mintors), which
    incorrectly specified Rule 1597 (which does not exist).

"Free Fees just for Visiting" by Goethe
  If a Rule defines an action with a Fee, then a Player who is at that the
    Location corresponding to that Rule (and says so when e performs the
    action) may perform the action without paying the Fee.

"Perhaps it is Somewhat More Civilized" by Syllepsis
  All current Dissolutes become subject to Looting Auctions.

"The Bank Should Not Be Under The Control Of The Oligarchy" by t
  Rule 1470 (The Bank) has its Adoption Index increased from 1 to 2.


PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1316  "Zombies may not be Players."
[FALSE]   8/16     Called by neil
          8/16     Assigned to root, who Judges TRUE
          8/22-23  Appealed by Murphy, Steve, root, and Crito
          8/26     Appeal assigned to Taral, Peekee, and Murphy
          9/6      Taral, Peekee, and Murphy recused from Board of Appeals
          9/6      Appeal reassigned to Crito, Oerjan, and solublefish
          9/10     Oerjan moves to overturn and reverse
          9/11     Crito moves to overturn and reverse
          9/11     solublefish moves to overturn and reverse
          Caller's argument (summary):  Players have duties (obeying the Rules,
            from Rule 101) and so Rule 1755 prevents a Zombie from being one.
            While Rule 1042 states that Silent Players become Zombies, it does
            not state that they remain Players afterward.  Zombies are
            Property, Players are individuals, international law prohibits
            slavery, and it is in the best interest of the game not to violate
            international law.
          Counterargument:  Rules 1976, 1885, 1886, 1755 itself, 1992, 1555,
            1963, 1936, and 559 all clearly intend that Zombies remain Players,
            and cease being Zombies if they cease being Players.  Rule 1042
            explicitly contains the clause "the Zombie is a Player", though it
            is embedded within another clause.  "Property" does not have its
            natural language meaning in Agora, and Zombies may escape their
            Property-ness at any time by becoming Noisy, so anti-slavery law
            does not apply.

CFJ 1318 "Rule 1470 explicitly permits all transfers of Property from the
[TRUE]    Bank, and therefore no transfer of Property from the Bank is
          unauthorized for the purpose of Rule 1981."
         9/12     Called by Murphy
         9/12-18  Assigned to solublefish, who Judges TRUE
         Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1470 says "The Bank is permitted to
           transfer Property in its possession to other entities."

CFJ 1319 "There exist no entity known as Steve's Bond Scam Contest."
[TRUE]   9/12     Called by neil
         9/12-19  Assigned to Lindrum, who Judges TRUE
         Caller's argument (summary):  Steve's Bond Scam Contest was dissolved
           and nothing has caused it to continue to exist.

CFJ 1320 "There do not exist any Bonds issued by Steve's Bond Scam Contest."
[FALSE]  9/12     Called by neil
         9/12-17  Assigned to Crito, who Judges FALSE
         Caller's argument (summary):  Steve's Bond Scam Contest (if it exists
           at all) is neither a Player nor an entity with an Executor, so Bonds
           issued by it no longer satisfy Rule 1966 (a).
         Judge's refutation (summary):  Rule 1966 (a) need only hold when the
           Bond is issued.

CFJ 1321 "There do not exist any Bonds issued by David."
[TRUE]   9/12     Called by neil
         9/12-15  Assigned to Peekee, who Judges TRUE
         9/15-19  Appealed by harvel, Crito, and Goethe
         9/19     Appeal assigned to Syllepsis, Oerjan, and Steve
         9/19     Oerjan moves to sustain
         9/25     Steve moves to overturn and reassign
         9/25     solublefish moves to sustain
         Caller's argument (summary):  David is neither a Player nor an entity
           with an Executor, so Bonds issued by em no longer satisfy Rule 1966
           (a).

CFJ 1322 "The Player, former Player, or Dissolute Blob has at least one Blot."
[FALSE]  9/19     Called by Goethe
         9/19-20  Assigned to Oerjan, who Judges FALSE
         Caller's argument (summary):  A Sentencing Order ordered the Herald to
           record that Blob incurred Blots.  Blob was a Zombie Player at the
           time, but ceased to be a Player before the Herald obeyed the Order.
         Judge's refutation (summary):  Rule 1435 says that only Players have
           Blots, and takes precedence over Rules attempting to say otherwise.
