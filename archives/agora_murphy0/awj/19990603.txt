CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1125  "Rule 1883 has not been repealed."
[TRUE]    4/24       Called by Blob
          4/26-30    Assigned to Crito, who Judges TRUE
          4/30-5/30  Appealed by Steve, elJefe, and Kolja A.
          Caller's argument (summary):  "An Object Lesson" was embedded
            in a spam message, so did not give a "clear indication" of
            being a Proposal as required by Rule 1483.

CFJ 1126  "In posting a message to agora-business with the subject
[FALSE]    'Maximize your website's traffic!', Steve committed the
Reversed   Crime of Misrepresentation by listing 'janet9981@yahoo.com'
to TRUE    as the 'From:' address."
          4/30      Called by Chuck
          4/30-5/2  Assigned to harvel, who Judges FALSE
          5/6-7     Appealed by Blob, Chuck, Michael, and Crito
          5/7       Appeal assigned to Crito, Blob, and Morendil
          Caller's argument (summary):  Steve believed the information
            in question to be incorrect, the criterion of Rule 1497.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  It is unclear that Rule 1497
            applies to message headers.  It is unclear that Steve sent
            the message in question.
          Board of Appeals overturns (summary):  Steve did send the
            message in question, and thus presented as correct
            information (the identity of the sender) which e believed
            to be incorrect.

CFJ 1131  "The message sent to the Public Forum with headers which read
[TRUE]     in part:

Message-Id:<3.0.1.32.19990406101136.009bcec-@proxy.pn.beam.com.au>
            Date: Fri, 16 Apr 1999 10:11:36 +1000
            To: agora-busines-@gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au
            From: janet998-@yahoo.com
            Subject: Maximize your website's traffic!
           was sent by Steve."
          5/3     Called by Steve
          5/6-21  Assigned to Murphy, who defaults
          5/21    Assigned to Vlad, who apparently defaults
          5/30    Assigned to Morendil, who Judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  A preponderance of evidence
            (the criterion of Rule 1575) supports the statement.
          Judge's agreement (summary):  See the Appeal of CFJ 1126.

CFJ 1132  "Chuck has violated Rule 1434 (Default Procedure for
[TRUE]     Referendum Voting) by failing to perform his duties as Vote
           Collector."
          5/12  Called by Steve
          5/18  Assigned to Peekee, who Judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Chuck's Referendum to Impeach
            Steve as Clerk of the Courts failed automatically, because
            no results were announced within a week after the Voting
            Period ended.  Steve equates this with violation of Rule
            1434's requirement to announc results.

CFJ 1133  "A group is a voting Entity, and so is 'An Active Voter' as
[FALSE]    described in Rule 1873 'A Duty to Vote'."
          5/21     Called by Peekee
          5/21-25  Assigned to Kolja A., who Judges FALSE
          Caller's argument:  none
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Groups are not Voters.

CFJ 1134  "The Assessor should make determinations whether or not the
[TRUE]     Vizers of various Groups, as Players have effective control
           of the Group's Voting Tokens."
          5/21     Called by Peekee
          5/21-23  Assigned to elJefe, who Judges TRUE
          Caller's argument:  none
          Judge's agreement (summary):  A Group may grant its Vizier
            effective control of its VTs, and thus the Vizier may be
            guilty of Failure to Vote on eir own behalf.  However, a
            Group is not a Voter and cannot be guilty of Failure to
            Vote.

CFJ 1135  "The Order of the Evil eye was an Active Voter with effective
[FALSE]    control of more than three Voting Tokens at the time
           distribution of the last batch of proposals, it was not
           denied Voting Privileges at that time, it was Active at the
           end of the Voting Period of the Proposal in the batch whose
           Voting Period finished last, and it failed to cast a vote on
           any Proposal in the batch.  Therefore it committed the
           Infraction of Failure to Vote and the Assessor should of
           detected and reported this infraction."
          5/21     Called by Peekee
          5/21-23  Assigned to Michael, who Judges FALSE
          Caller's argument:  none
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Groups are not Voters, and are
            neither Active nor Inactive.

CFJ 1136  "Wes is currently not in eir grace period."
          5/21  Called by Kolja A.
          5/30  Assigned to Elysion
          Caller's argument (summary):  It has been suggested that Wes
            is General Chaos.

CFJ 1137  "If a CFJ alleging that a Player has committed a Crime is
           initially Judged FALSE, and that decision is later reversed
           by a Board of Appeals, it is the duty of the original Judge
           to issue the Sentencing Orders associated with conviction of
           that Crime."
          5/25  Called by Chuck
          5/30  Assigned to Elysion
          Caller's argument:  none

CFJ 1138  "Morendil's transfer of one Kudo from Wes to Chuck was
           invalid due to a lack of a valid justification for doing
           so."
          5/28  Called by Wes
          5/30  Assigned to Chuck
