ERRATA

ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Kudononsuch" by Goethe - Proposal 4837 adopted 10/2
  Pending draws are either free or heavy (stuck switch Encumbrance).
  Only free pending draws increase hand size.  Heavy pending draws cannot be
    satisfied if the gambler's hand size exceeds the maximum hand size.
  If a gambler has both heavy and free pending draws, the heavy ones must be
    satisfied (to the extent possible) first.
  If a gambler loses a pending draw, e loses free ones first.  If e has no
    draws, e loses a card; if e has no cards, e loses eir next pending draw.
  Each player gets three heavy draws and one free draw per month, and one
    heavy draw for each of eir adopted proposals.
  Boons give free draws.  Albatrosses take away draws.
  Checking out cards from the Library is done by spending draws.
  When the deck is frozen, all heavy draws are lost.
  Repeal kudos, fees, and expunging blots for a fee.

"Move your ors" by Goethe - Proposal 4835 adopted 10/2
  Remove superfluous commas and an "or" from Rule 698 (Always an Eligible
    Judge).

"New game in town" by Goethe - Proposal 4838 adopted 10/2
  Replace Winning Hands in the Deckmastor's budget with Scoring Instructions
    in the Cardbooks.
  Blueprint Scoring Instructions may be amended with M support and without N
    objections (M >= N >= 1 at the time of the change).
  Initial Scoring Instructions in the Onepower Cardbook:
    0. Each SI has a unique index, default (highest existing + 1).  Each
         hand has a complex score, default 0.
    1. SIs are applied in order of increasing index, affecting all hands
         simultaneously.
    9999. Winning score is > 250 and > any other non-site score.
  Initial Scoring Instructions in the Blueprints Cardbook:
    10. Each card adds to score based on the first letter of its caption
          (A -> 1, B -> 2, ..., Z -> 26).

"Odds and Ends" by Goethe - Proposal 4839 adopted 10/2
  Repeal Prime Executors.
  Repeal Nth Anniversary Ribbon, and closing the courts on Agora's Birthday.

"Speaker Reforms" by Goethe and Maud - Proposal 4836 adopted 10/2
  Proposals are once again ordinary by default.
  The Speaker may make undistributed proposals democratic for free, and may
    veto distributed ordinary proposals without needing support (increasing
    their Adoption Index by 1).
  The Speaker may rubberstamp ordinary proposals during their voting period,
    setting their quorum to 3.
  Cardinals are continuously defined.
  Pope selection uses the mechanisms of Agoran decisions, rather than a
    custom nominate-and-support system.
  Finish repealing Speaker Taint.
  New card Debate-o-Matic (Common, initial quota 10; change a proposal's
    chamber).  Repeal Chamber fees, in anticipation of repealing fees in
    general (see "Kudononsuch").

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Clarify Rule 1567" by Murphy
  Requests like e.g. "all CFJs for the next two weeks" are interpreted
    as "all CFJs called within the next two weeks".

"Generalize Compensation for Ex-Cards" by Murphy
  When a class of cards is repealed, non-site instances are converted to
    pending draws.

"Order categorical" by Goethe - Proposal 4841
  Merge Rule 1048 (Rule Categories) into Rule 1681 (The Logical Rulesets).
  New rules are assigned to categories at the Rulekeepor's discretion.  All
    other category operations are without 2 objections.

"some fixup" by Goethe - Proposal 4840
  Replace the Grace Period kudo clause with three free draws.
  Add a missing word to Rule 2019 (The Speaker's Veto) ("Assessor shall

    poker rules (except with Dead Man's Hand - AS AC 8S 8C JH and nothing
    else - beating royal flush).

    to the gambler with highest hand rank.

"boon cash-out" by Goethe
  Convert boons at the time of "Kudononsuch"'s adoption to heavy draws.

"Diebold Electronic Voting Machines" by Murphy (backlogged from April)

    some cards to manipulate it.

    unless someone objects, in which case the Speaker conducts it as before.

"Fix Contempt" by Murphy (backlogged from April)
  If an order is invalid or improper, there shall be no penalty for either
    obeying or disobeying it.

"Pending Draw Reform" by Murphy
  Replace pending draws with chips.

"Simplify Orders" by Murphy (backlogged from April)
  Define the Commander, Commanded, Positive Orders (to act) and Negative
    Orders (to refrain from acting).
  If an Order commands an Office, a change in holder does not absolve the
    old holder of past violations.
  Centralize the definitions of when orders are issued and become effective.
  An Order's Base Time is its issue date, effective date, or (if commanding
    an Office) the last time the Office changed hands, whichever is most
    recent.  Default time limit is ASAP after the Base Time.
  Propriety of Orders is explicitly left to judicial discretion.
  Define Orders to Cancel, and reword specific stay/vacation of Orders to

    Parchments, Ballots, and Kudos.
  Red + Green -> Parchment, Red + Blue -> Ballot, Green + Blue -> Kudo.
  All cost indexes are reset quarterly.
  A player's voting power is one, plus one for every five ballots e
    possessed at the start of the voting period, plus one for every ballot
    e spends on that proposal.
  A player's proposing power (number of proposals e may submit per week) is
    one, plus one for every five parchments e possessed at the start of the
    week, plus one for every parchment e spends that week.

          2/26/01-3/8/01    Assigned to Syllepsis, who Judges TRUE
          8/10/05           Goethe motions the now-deregistered Syllepsis to
                              consider a spurious argument ("Basset Hounds
                              have Long Ears"); see CFJ 1575
          8/26/05-10/16/05  Motion assigned to root; e fulfills eir (buggy)
                              requirement to judge by judging TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  The Assessor's announcement specified
            the Vote count correctly, but specified the result of that Vote
            count (adoption or rejection) incorrectly.
          Judge's argument (summary):  Later in the message, the Assessor
            specified the result of the Vote count correctly.

CFJ 1575  "root is required to deliver a legal judgement for CFJ 1278."
[TRUE]    8/26     Called by Goethe
          9/18-25  Assigned to Eris, who judges TRUE
