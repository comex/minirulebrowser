ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"A Hero's Reward" by Goethe - Proposal 4173 adopted 6/26
  Chuck becomes a Hero on Agora's Birthday.
  Heros may register, but lose the Patent Title of Hero upon doing so.

"Bonds Revisited" by Blob - Proposal 4171 adopted 6/26
  The Usuror is a Limited Executor of the Bank, able to satisfy Bond debts owed
    by the Bank.
  The Usuror's Budget includes the Credit Limit for Bank Currencies other than
    Stems, between 0 and 10 of the Currency's MUQ.

"Calling Bonds" by Kelly - Proposal 4163 adopted 6/11
  The issuer of a Bond may call it (accelerating it immediately) by announcing
    that e does so.

"Choosable Auctions, Vickrey Auctions, and Raffles" by root - Proposal 4167
  adopted 6/11
[Choosable Auctions and Vickrey Auctions originally authored by Elysion]
  An Auctioneer may choose any Rules-defined Auction procedure; the current one
    is the default if e does not.
  In a Vickrey Auction:
    * The Auction lasts one week.
    * Bidders may bid privately.
    * Players with the same Executor as the Auctioneer must bid in public, and
        during the first three days.
    * The Auction Price is the highest non-winning bid.
  In a Raffle:
    * All tickets cost the same amount.
    * Winning tickets are randomly selected.
    * The Riff-Raff may pay out the Ticket Price to emself if there were at
        least three winners other than emself.  (A similar provision is removed
        from Papyrus Auctions.)

"Finish Helping New Players" by harvel - Proposal 4168 adopted 6/19
  Players who registered on or after September 21, 2000, and had a Grace Period
    from it that ended before "Help New Players" was adopted, receive the
    current New Player Award minus the New Player Award at the time of eir
    registration.
  Players who registered on or after September 21, 2000, and were in eir Grace
    Period when "Help New Players" was adopted, owe the Bank (for each Bank
    Currency) the current New Player Award or the New Player Award at the time
    of eir registration, whichever is less.

"Fix Dereliction of Duty" by Murphy - Proposal 4164 adopted 6/11
  Rule 1644 (Dereliction of Duty) is merged into Rule 1686 (Official Reports)
    in a consistent fashion.

"Fix Mentor's Bonus" by root - Proposal 4172 adopted 6/26
  The Mentor Bonus equals the New Player Award for Stems, not for all
    Currencies.

"Fix Rule 1686" by Syllepsis - Proposal 4169 adopted 6/19
  Failure to Report is detectable by the Assistant Director of Personnel (not
    the Grand Warden of the Oligarchy).

"Fix Rule 1712" by Elysion - Proposal 4162 adopted 6/4
  Amount of Indulgences to Auction monthly is rounded down to the nearest
    integer.

"Fix Rule 1868" by Elysion - Proposal 4166 adopted 6/11
  The Clerk of the Courts is required to select and announce a Judge based on a
    single ASAP requirement, rather than two requirements in succession.

"Justiciar Option" by Elysion - Proposal 4170 adopted 6/26
  Rule 1831 (Filing a CFJ with the Justiciar) is merged into Rule 991 (Invoking
    Judgement).
  Any CFJ may be filed with the Justiciar, though Rule 991 recommends against
    doing so for no good reason.

"Proper Persistent Indebtedness" by Kelly - Proposal 4165 adopted 6/11
  The creditor of a debt may simply demand its satisfaction, rather than
    Ordering such.
  Persistent Indebtedness is committed:
    * By an entity's Executor, or (if none) its Limited Executor.
    * Only if the Executor (Limited Executor) is authorized to execute a
        transfer for that entity which would satisfy the debt.
    * Only if the entity has Property sufficient to satisfy the debt.

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Another Use for Indulgences" by Elysion - Proposal 4175
  A Player may pay 1 Indulgence to change eir Role after six weeks, or 3
    Indulgences to change it immediately.

"Auction Patches" by root - Proposal 4176
  Items are Auctioned in lots.
  The owner of an Auctioned lot incurs a debt for that lot to a winning Bidder,
    skipping the "pay out" mechanism.
  Vickrey Auctions don't say what happens if there are exactly as many
    uncancelled Bids as there are lots up for Auction.  In this case, the Final
    Auction Price is the Starting Bid.

"Don't be overkill" by Ziggy
  Oligardiness is reduced from a Class 2 to a Class 1 Infraction.

"Executors Revamped" by Steve
  An Executor may act on behalf of an Executee, but no longer "as if e is the
    Executee".
  Limited Executors is explicitly defined.
  Entities may have multiple Executors.
  An entity may have at most one Prime Executor with respect to a certain
    action.
  A Player is eir own Prime Executor by default.
  The Holder of Power of Attorney is Prime Executor of the Grantor.
  The Treasuror is Prime Executor of the Bank, except for debts in a Bank
    Currency, for which the Recordkeepor is Prime Executor.
  Embezzlement covers all Property transfers not explicitly required or
    permitted by the Rules.
  Rules 947 (Bonus for Repeal), 1959 (Wills), and 1598 (Property Transfers) no
    longer explicitly mention Executors.

"Fix Bank Debt Bugs" by Murphy
  Rule 1946 (Distribution of Voting Entitlements) loses an incorrect clause
    that each winning Bidder gets 1.0 rather than 0.1 VE.
  The Registrar pays out New Player Awards, rather than Ordering the Treasuror
    to do so.
  Various debts to and from the Bank are adjusted by declaration.

"Fix Unready Judges" by root - Proposal 4178
  A Player who becomes ineligible to Judge due to a Grace Period is treated as
    if e became ineligible by request; in particular, e may become eligible by
    request while still in eir Grace Period.

"Fix Periodic Compensations" by Taral - Proposal 4179
  Salaries and Distributor's Gratuity require 16 (not 12) days of holding the
    appropriate position.

"Heroism is Catching" by Kelly
  Douglas Hofstadter becomes a Hero.

"Justice for All" by Kelly
  The Rules may not prevent any person from obtaining Agoran judgement on any
    justiciable question.

"Last Wish" by Murphy
  Chuck is re-registered and goes up for Zombie Auction again (this time with a
    minimum Bid of 1 Indulgence, not 12).

"LET'S GET THIS SHOW ON THE ROAD ALREADY" by Elysion - Proposal 4180
  It takes 100 (not 200) Points to Win.

"Raffle Patch" by Elysion - Proposal 4177
  Players unable to Bid in an Auction cannot buy Raffle tickets either, if the
    Auction is a Raffle (which does not involve Bidding).

"Simplify Organizations" by Murphy
  Rule 1528 (Organizations) is simplified in language, mentions Administrators,
    and states that all required properties except Class may be changed by
    unanimous member consent.
  Rules 1614 (Organizations' Names) and 1612 (Organizations' SLCs) are
    simplified in language.
  A Rule is created that explicitly lists Classes of Organizations.
  Rule 1531 (Administrators and Their Duties) generally allows a Charter or
    another Rule to separate the identities of the Administrator, Maintainer,
    and Executor.
  Rules 1533 (Application to Create an Organization) and 1397 (Dissolution of
    Organizations) simply refer to the list of properties that Organizations
    are required to have, rather than reiterating the list.
  Rule 1617 (Changing the Jurisdiction of an Organization's SLC) is repealed,
    as it is now redundant with Rule 1528.

"The Scribes' Council" by Kelly - Proposal 4174
  The Scribes' Council is the set of all Scribes.
  A Player may make a Proposal Distributable for free with the support of a
    majority of the Scribes' Council.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Bastille Day" by Oerjan
  On Bastille Day (July 14), each Rebel counts double toward the chance of
    success if e publicly hums a few bars of "La Marseillaise", but a
    successful Rebellion leaves each Rebel with one Blot (even if e was
    previously Immaculate).

"Fix Currency Awards" by harvel
  The Registrar shall inform the Treasuror of new Players; the Treasuror is
    then directly required by the Rules to pay out the New Player Award.

"Good Agoran Rewards" by solublefish
  Kudos are a Currency.  The Recordkeepor is the Herald.  The MUQ is 0.1.
  The Mentor's Bonus is 4 Kudos.
  The Speaker's Patronage is 1 Kudo.
  Agora's Birthday gives 1 Kudo to each Player, 0.5 Kudo to each Player who
    recognizes it, and 2 Kudos to each worthy Contest.
  The Bonus for Repeal is 1 Kudo.
  Each candidate in an Election receives extra Votes equal to eir Kudos at the
    beginning of the Election, and is then billed for those Kudos.

"Introducing Standing" by Goethe
  A Judge may dismiss a CFJ if its case lacks standing, i.e. its outcome will
    not apply to the actual current gamestate (other than the processing of the
    CFJ itself).

"Judicial Simplification, Part 1 of 2" by Murphy
  Rule 991 (Invoking Judgement) picks up the core of Rule 1563 (Statement of a
    CFJ).  Rule 1563 is repealed in Part 2.

"Judicial Simplification, Part 2 of 2" by Murphy
  A CFJ may be filed with the Justiciar for any reason, though this is not
    recommended in the general case.
  Rules 897 (Barring Players from Judgement), 1562 (Excess CFJs), 1868
    (Selecting a Judge), 408 (Late Judgement), 591 (Legal Judgements), 1575
    (Standards of Proof) have their language simplified.
  Rule 698 (Always an Eligible Judge) is reworded to restore eligibility to
    groups of Players at a time, rather than changing the overall eligibility
    formula at each step.
  Rule 1756 (Delinquent Judges) is repealed.
  DISMISSED is a Judgement.  Other Rules are adjusted accordingly.
  Rule 1447 (Final Judgement upon Appeal) is split into three parts:  how soon
    a Justice must determine, what determinations e may make, and what e is
    paid for determining on time.
  Rule 908 (Formal Apologies) picks up the text of Rule 1832 (Failure to
    Apologize), which is then repealed.

"Little Fluffy Clouds" - author unknown; republished by Kelly
  <No, I'm sorry, this proto is much too silly.  Stop it right now.  Or consult
    the a-d archive for June 18, if you absolutely must.>

"Make Buying Democracy Easier" by neil
  An Untained Speaker may (With 3 Supporters) Sanitise an Ordinary Interested
    Proposal which no one has attempted to Democratise, making it Democratic
    and Sane.  If this happens during its Voting Period (which requires someone
    to pay 1 Papyrus), then all Votes are cancelled and the Voting Period is
    extended to seven days after the Sanitising.
  A Player may (With Support) attempt to Democratise an Ordinary Interesting
    Proposal.  This costs 0.1 VE except for an Untainted Speaker.  Until the
    end of the Voting Period, Players may pay VEs to Vote FOR or AGAINST
    Democratisation.  If FORs >= AGAINSTs, then all Votes are cancelled and the
    Voting Period is extended by seven days.

"Palace Coup" by Goethe
  Upon a successful Rebellion, as many Rebels as possible become Oligarchs for
    free.

"Palace Coup - Counter-Proto-Proposal" by harvel
  Upon a successful Rebellion, abiding Oligarchs are retired (or all Oligarchs,
    if they are all Rebellious); then all Rebellious non-Oligarchs become
    Oligarchs for free.

"Pay for CFJ" by root
  A CFJ is Judicable (shall be assigned to a Judge):
    * If a fee of 1 Indulgence is paid.
    * With 2 Supporters, or With Support from the Speaker, CotC, or Justiciar.
    * If it alleges that the Speaker, CotC, or Justiciar has failed in eir
        duties.

"The Neo-Oligarchy" by Elysion
  There may be any number of Oligarchs.  All Oligarchs have the Voting Power
    that Low Oligarchs currently have.
  Current Oligarchs become Elder Oligarchs for three months.  (The Rulekeepor
    may repeal this clause Without Objection if there are no Elder Oligarchs.)
  The GWotO's Budget includes the Oligarchy Auction Rate, from 1 to 4.  The
    GWotO may amend eir Budget Without 2 Oligarch Objections.
  Each month, the GWotO shall auction a number of Oligarchy positions equal to
    the Oligarchy Auction Rate, and shall bill each non-Elder Oligarch 0.1 VEs
    (and remove anyone who doesn't pay within seven days).
  Rebels remain in the Oligarchy on a successful Rebellion.

"The Nulligarchy" by Goethe
  Any Politician may be an Oligarch for 0.5 VE + (0.1 VE/month), or a
    Nulligarch for 0.2 VEs, but not both.
  All Oligarchs have one Vote on Ordinary Proposals.
  Once every two months, a Player may (With Support, and with a 0.5 VE fee)
    Call for Nullification.  Players Vote for either the Oligarchy or the
    Nulligarchy, similar to a Democratic Proposal.
  VN = Votes for Nulligarchy, VO = Votes for Oligarchy
  NN = Number of Nulligarchs, NO = Number of Oligarchs
  If (VN/VO) > (NN/NO), then:
    * All Oligarchs lose their positions.
    * Each Nulligarch has a week to nominate one other Nulligarch as an
        Oligarch.
    * min(NN/2, NO) Nulligarchs with the most nominations become Oligarchs;
        the Speaker breaks ties.
  Upon a successful Rebellion, a Nullification Election occurs, except that:
    * Only Rebels may Vote.
    * Rebels nominate Nulligarchs to become Oligarchs.
    * The First Rebel breaks ties.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1294  6/11  Judge Taral vacates eir stay of Blob's Orders

CFJ 1295  "The Orders issued by Blob in <20010508144200.E5865@cse.unsw.edu.au>
[TRUE]     http://www.escribe.com/games/agora-business/m3682.html are

          5/10-17  Assigned to Evantine, who Judges TRUE and vacates Blob's
                     Orders
          5/13     Evantine submits and grants a Motion to emself, and Orders
                     Clerk of the Courts Wes to stay Blob's Orders ASAP
          5/14     Clerk of the Courts Wes stays Blob's Orders
          5/17-18  Appealed by Taral, Kelly, and lee
          5/19     Appeal assigned to Steve, Kelly, and Wes

                     Orders vacating Judge Evantine's vacation of Blob's Orders
          5/25-30  Reassigned to Lindrum, who Judges FALSE
          5/30     Lindrum vacates all previous Orders to stay Blob's Orders
          6/3-4    Appealed by Murphy, Evantine, and Goethe
          6/4      Clerk of the Courts Taral stays Blob's Orders
          6/4      Appeal assigned to Steve, Kelly, and Taral
          6/11     Kelly, Taral, and Steve move to overturn and reassign
          6/11-18  Reassigned to solublefish, who Judges TRUE
          6/19     solublefish vacates Blob's Orders
          Caller's argument (summary):  Orders to satisfy debts are regulated
            by Rule 1599 and may target only the debtor, not its Executor or
            Limited Executor.
          Judge Evantine's argument (summary):  The Orders are Administrative
            Orders (Blob prefaced them with "As Executor of the Bank"), hence
            they are regulated, hence they are not blanket-permitted by Rule
            101; and they are not explicitly permitted by the Rules, hence they
            are invalid.
          Justice Steve's argument (summary):  Although Blob is Executor of the
            Bank because e is Treasuror, e was not necessarily carrying out a
            Treasuror duty.  In particular, it doesn't matter what type of
            Order Blob intended to make, only what type of Order e actually
            made.  Treasuror duties are limited to what the Rules explicitly
            impose, so the Orders are Private and valid (but may or may not be
            proper).
          Justice Kelly's argument (summary):  The Orders are Private, for the
            same reasons given by Steve.  They are valid, because no Rule says
            they are not.  They may or may not be proper, and the truth of the
            Statement depends on their propriety.
          Judge Lindrum's argument (summary):  Blob (Executor of the Bank) is
            explicitly allowed (Rule 1599) to Order Razl (Executor of the
            Bank's debtors) to act as if e were the debtors (Rule 1478) and
            satisfy the debts.
          Justice Kelly's argument (summary):  Notary Razl is Limited Executor,
            not Executor, of the debtors.
          Justice Steve's argument (summary):  A Limited Executor is permitted
            to act on behalf of the Executee, but not as if e were the
            Executee; so e cannot be targeted as if e were the Executee.  It is
            explicitly discretionary, not a duty, for the Notary to dispose of
            Abandoned Property.
          Further counterargument:  Rule 1478 does not equate the Executor and
            Executee except at the moment when the Executor acts on behalf of
            the Executee.

CFJ 1298  "'Distributor' is a Patent Title which may be changed at the opinion
[FALSE]    of the Registrar."
          5/30    Called by Goethe
          6/4-11  Assigned to Razl, who Judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  'Distributor' continues to be a Unique
            Patent Title, because it used to be defined by Rule 1923/5 and has
            not been explicitly revoked.  Rules 1923/6 and 1670/13 now describe
            'Distributor' without referring to it as a Patent Title.
          Judge Razl's refutation (summary):  This position of 'Distributor' is
            distinct from the Patent Title of Distributor.

CFJ 1301  "Rule 1479 should be interpreted such that an Order, which requires a
[TRUE]     Player to pay out one or more Properties to some entity, and which
           is valid and proper under the Rules, causes the Bank to incur one or
           more debts to the named entity."
          6/7     Called by root
          6/9-13  Assigned to Syllepsis, who Judges TRUE
          6/14    Syllepsis Orders Annotation of Rule 1479
          6/26    Appealed by Murphy
          Judge Syllepsis's argument (summary):  Rule 1479 creates a debt from
            a pay-out only if it is "required by the Rules".  Rule 1023
            contains a Rule requirement based on ASAP timing, and Rule 1795
            assigns implicit ASAP timing to Orders with missing or invalid
            explicit timing.
          Commentary:  For Orders with explicit non-ASAP timing, there is no
            direct Rule requirement; Rule 1810 Criminalizes non-compliance, but
            does not actually require compliance.  The Rules may be interpreted
            as indirectly requiring Order-based pay-outs (because the Rules say
            that the Orders directly require compliance).

CFJ 1302  "In eir message on or about 11 Jun 2001 14:57:38 -0400, player
[TRUE]     solublefish did not transfer 120 Stems to the Bank."
          6/18     Called by Kelly
          6/18-26  Assigned to Hooloovoo, who Judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  A message "if X, then I transfer Y" is
            not an intent to transfer Property, but rather an intent to achieve
            a Gamestate that may or may not involve a transfer.  Thus, Rule
            1598 is not triggered, and a transfer does not occur.

CFJ 1303  "Razl is Noisy."
          6/24     Called by Goethe
          6/24-25  Assigned to Blob, who proto-Judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Steve, who has Power of Attorney over
            Razl, claimed to cause Razl to make emself Noisy.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  A Player becomes Noisy by posting to
            the Public Forum, not by claiming to become Noisy.

CFJ 1304  "If the Executor of an entity posts to the Public Forum - clearly
           stating that e posts to the Public Forum on behalf of the entity,
           as if e were the entity - then the entity is considered to have
           posted to the Public Forum."
