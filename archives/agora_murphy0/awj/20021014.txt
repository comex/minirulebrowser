ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Alternative Weather Determination" by Sir Toby - Proposal 4383 adopted 9/11
  The Treasuror's Budget includes the Foul Weather Factor and the Weather
    Intensity Factor, each multiples of 0.1 ranging from 0 to 10.  Initially,
    both are 2.
  Weather probabilities are proportional as follows:
    Foul   = Bank Stems times Foul Weather Factor (rounded up)
    Plenty = non-Bank Stems
    Fair   = (Foul + Plenty) / 4 (rounded up) i.e. 25% or slightly more
    Same   = (Foul + Plenty) / 4 (rounded up) i.e. 25% or slightly more
  The Bank's Stem gain/loss is multiplied by the Weather Intensity Factor.

"Fix Birthday Gifts" by Steve (authored by Murphy) - Proposal 4376 adopted 9/6
  Birthday Stems are not required to be transferred by the Payroll Clerk (which
    e is not empowered to do), but required to be paid out by the (Registrar /

  Stems may be transferred from a non-Bank entity to a Group.
  Stems may no longer be transferred from an Organization to a non-Bank entity.
  Groups may bid in Auctions.
  All Private Land, not just Player-owned Land, counts toward the limit on
    Land Auctions (i.e. they stop when at least half the Map is Private).

"In defence of natural language" by Steve (authored by Murphy) - Proposal 4380
    adopted 9/11

"Meesa Do Typo, Meesa Fix R1950" by OscarMeyr - Proposal 4370 adopted 9/6

"Refined Movement" by Sir Toby - Proposal 4373 adopted 9/6
  Instead of spending 10 Movement Units to change the Land Type of an adjacent
    Unit to a random non-Aether Type, a Player may spend 10 Movement Units to
    change the Land Type of any non-Aether Unit to an alternating Type.  The
    alternating Type cycles through all non-Aether Types defined by the Rules,
    starting with the first one.

"Repeal Opposite Proposals" by Steve - Proposal 4378 adopted 9/11

    (which e is not empowered to do anyway), but is required to Order the Bank
    to forgive them.

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

"Blame Canada" by Steve (authored by Murphy) - Proposal 4381 rejected 9/11

    Speaker shall try to get them to recognize Agora.

  This is an intentional duplicate of Steve's Proposal, made to take advantage
    of a trade offer that Steve technically did not satisfy.

"Criminal Reform" by Eris (authored by Murphy) - Proposal 4379 rejected 9/11
  ASAP is changed from a cascading requirement to a straight definition.
  Rule 1553 (Officer Transition) loses the text "violates this Rule", since it
    already defines a Crime.
  Rules 1724 (Urgent Proposals), 1770 (Distributing Proposals), and 1827
    (Granting or Denying Motions) lose the concept "detect and report", which
    has elsewhere been shortened to "report".
  Sentencing Orders penalize Crimes; Ticketing Orders penalize Infractions;
    they shall be necessary and sufficient to apply the penalty.
  A Formal Apology may substitute for the Sentencing Orders of any Crime.
  Players are encouraged to CFJ on Infractions only when a question of
    interpretation, rather than fact, arises.
  If a Sentencing or Ticketing Order for Blots is recorded and then vacated,
    then the Blots are expunged.
  Violating a Rule (in the absence of any other penalty) is the Class N Crime
    of Disobedience.  N is the Power of the violated Rule, but at most 4.
  Violating a SLC (unless necessary to avoid violating the Rules or another SLC
    with precedence) is the Class 1 Crime of Insubordination.

    Estate Votes.

"Reinstate the Points penalty for Crimes" by OscarMeyr - Proposal 4395

  A Player must wait one week before changing eir Activity Level in either
    direction.
  Silence triggers a Notice of Abandonment, sent to all Public Fora and to the
    Player's preferred e-mail address.  If the Notice is still valid one month

"Fix the Thesis Committee" by OscarMeyr

    to be selected for it, except the author of that Thesis.
  The author may select a member.  If e does not do so, then the Speaker is
    selected.
  <A second member is chosen, somehow.>
  The first two members choose a third member.  If they do not do so within a
    week after the Thesis is first published, then the selection is random.
  <Members who become ineligible are replaced, somehow.>
  The Chair is the Player who has been a member the longest.
  The Chair publishes the Committee's decision, which is APPROVE, REJECT, or
    REWRITE.  If REWRITE, then the Committee continues to exist.

"Informing Notices" by harvel
  When a Player receives a valid notice appropriately addressed to em, e is
    informed of its contents.
  A Player receives a message sent to a Public Forum or to any of eir current
    preferred e-mail addresses, but not messages received only to a Discussion
    Forum.

"No Support, No Objections" by Peekee
  An action Without 0 Objections, or With 0 Supporters, may be performed
    without needing to announce intent first.

    previous Location).
  If Q-Bert would leave the Map, then it ceases to have a Location, and moves
    to (0,0) the next week.
  Q-Bert turns its destination Purple, unless it was already Purple, in which
    case it becomes a random Land Type other than Purple or Aether.  No other
    entity may set a Land Type to Purple.
  If Q-Bert moves to the same Location as another entity, then its next move
    is orthogonal.  However, it will not do this two weeks in a row.
  If Purple has Sente, then all Purple Units become a random Land Type with
    Gote.
  OscarMeyr is Q-Bert's Controller.  The Controller may transfer the title,
    with consent.

"Rebalance Group Votes" by OscarMeyr
  A Group's Voting Power on Democratic Proposals is based on the number of
    Active Players who belong to Groups, rather than the number of Players.

    from specific actions:  having a Role, being an Executor or Limited
    Executor of another entity, or joining a Group.

  Inactive Players can hold Offices whose Salary is less than the Poverty
    Level (a multiple of the Basic Officer Salary from 0 to 2, initially 0.5),
    but are required to perform the duties of any such Offices.

"Sensible Timing for Indulgence Auctions" by Murphy
  Indulgence Auctions are based entirely on the Gamestate at the beginning of
    the month, and pay attention to Indulgences that have been Auctioned but
    not yet received by the winners.  The number of Indulgences to Auction is
    rounded down to the nearest integer.

"Sorta Preserve Scores" by OscarMeyr
  When a Player deregisters and re-registers, and no Win or Score reset has
    occurred in between, then eir Score is what it was when e deregistered.

"The Repairman Always Rings Twice" by Steve (different from eir Proposal of the
    same name)

CFJ 1408 "Rulekeepor Michael has committed the Class 2 Crime of Unlawful
[TRUE]    Nondisclosure, as defined by Rule 1064/9."
         8/4      Called by RedKnight
         8/9-15   Assigned to Sir Toby, who Judges TRUE
         8/24-29  Appealed by Murphy, root, and Michael
         8/29     Appeal assigned to Steve, Eris, and OscarMeyr
         9/4      Board of Appeals sustains (OscarMeyr moved to reverse)
         Caller's argument (summary):  Michael made no response to RedKnight's
           request for a copy of all theses approved for degrees.
         Appellate Judges Steve and Eris (summary):  Michael is required to
           keep a subset of the requested information, and was required to
           respond by with the contents of that subset.  It happens to be
           empty, but e should have sent a message saying so.
         Appellate Judge OscarMeyr (summary):  Michael is not required to keep
           copies of all theses approved, only those approved by Committee, so
           e was not required to respond.

CFJ 1409 "Sir Toby's COE in
[FALSE]   http://www.escribe.com/games/agora-business/m7478.html
was not a

          valid Claim of Error."
         8/12      Called by OscarMeyr
         8/16      Incorrectly assigned to Craig, who is frozen
         8/27-9/8  Assigned to root, who defaults
         9/15-17   Assigned to Sir Toby, who makes emself ineligible
         9/19-20   Assigned to Michael, who Judges FALSE
         9/22      Appealed by OscarMeyr
         Caller's argument (summary):  Sir Toby's message attempts to be a COE
           on a COE.  The normal way to handle a COE is to Respond, then CFJ if
           needed.
         Judge's refutation (summary):  A COE is a representation of the
           Gamestate (not just the COEing Player's perception of it), so it
           can be the target of another COE.
         Commentary:  OscarMeyr published something, RedKnight COEd it, and
           Sir Toby COEd RedKnight's COE.  Judge Michael argued as if the first
           and third actions were performed by the same Player, but this does
           not clearly invalidate eir argument.

CFJ 1411 "OscarMeyr is Michael's Opposite on RedKnight's Thesis Committee."
         8/22  Called by Steve
         8/27  Assigned to Murphy, who Judges TRUE
         Caller's argument (summary):  Votes cast during the Quarter in
           question, and opposite to Michael's Votes on the same Proposals,
           were cast on Proposals 4281 through 4342.  Steve cast the largest
           number of such opposite Votes, but OscarMeyr cast opposite Votes on
           the largest number of Proposals.
         Judge's argument (summary):  "Most often" is interpreted such that
           multiple Votes cast at once count as one instance.  Thus, OscarMeyr
           had the most instances of opposing Michael.

CFJ 1412 "If a player is deregistered and then registers again without there
[FALSE]   being a Win since e was deregistered e returns with the same number
          of points as e had when e was deregistered."
         9/7      Called by Peekee
         9/15-18  Assigned to Steve, who Judges FALSE
         9/18     Appealed by RedKnight
         Caller's argument (summary):  Properties of a Player (such as Score)
           are preserved from deregistration to re-registration, unless the
           Rules explicitly state otherwise.
         Judge's refutation (summary):  Such Properties are preserved only if
           the Rules require someone to maintain a record of them.  The Rules
           do not require the Scorekeepor to maintain a record of the Scores
           of deregistered Players.

CFJ 1413 "Rule 1016 prohibits a frozen Player from becoming a Contestant in a
[TRUE]    Contest."
         9/19     Called by Steve, who also requests annotation of Rule 1016
         9/20-27  Assigned to Eris, who Judges TRUE but denies the request
         Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1016 restricts frozen Players from
           doing anything that Players can do, except thawing or deregistering.
           Joining a Contest as something that Players can do (Rule 1539).
         Commentary:  Depending on interpretation, Rule 1016 may or may not
           apply to each of the following:
             * "A non-frozen Player may do X" (clearly applies)
             * "An Active Player may do X"
             * "An Inactive Player may do X"
             * "A Player may do X"

CFJ 1414 "Frozen Players may Call CFJs."
[TRUE]   9/20       Called by Goethe (but invalid if false)
         9/20-22    Assigned to RedKnight, who Judges TRUE
         9/22       Appealed by harvel, Steve, and OscarMeyr
         9/23       Appeal assigned to Eris, Sir Toby, and (incorrectly) root;
                      later assigned to t
         9/25-26    Board of Appeals unanimously moves to overturn and reassign
         9/26-10/3  Assigned to OscarMeyr, who Judges TRUE
         Caller's argument (summary):  Frozen Players may do things that
           persons in general are allowed to do.  Persons in general are
           allowed to call CFJs (Rule 991).
         Judge RedKnight's argument (summary):  The latest Stare Decisis lists
           this as a CFJ, so by Rule 1768 (Evidentiary Status of Officer
           Reports) it is a CFJ.  Thus Goethe (who was/is frozen) could Call
           it, and thus the statement is proven by example.
         Counterargument (summary):  Prima facie evidence is not automatically
           correct, if "clear and convincing evidence to the contrary" exists.
         Judge OscarMeyr's argument (summary):  Rule 991 permits all persons to
           Call CFJs, and takes precedence over Rule 1016.

CFJ 1415 "A Frozen Player cannot be eir own Prime Executor."
         10/10  Called by Goethe; Linked to CFJs 1416 and 1417
         Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1989 says that each Player is eir
           own Prime Executor, and so Rule 1016 applies.
         Counterargument (summary):  Rule 1989 says what Players are, not what
           Players may do.

CFJ 1416 "A Frozen Player may transfer Property."
         10/10  Called by Goethe; Linked to CFJs 1415 and 1417
         Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1598 permits entities (not just
           Players) to transfer Property.
         Counterargument:  Frozen Players may be prohibited from acting as eir
           own Executor.  However, any person may act on eir own behalf,
           ignoring Executorship completely.

CFJ 1417 "A Frozen Player who is a Member of a Contest may perform Actions
          explicitly allowed to Contestants by that Contest's Regulations."
         10/10  Called by Goethe; Linked to CFJs 1415 and 1416
         Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1016 only applies to actions
           allowed by the Rules, not by the Regulations of a Contest.
