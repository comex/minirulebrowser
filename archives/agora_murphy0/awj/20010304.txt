     "THE END IS NI"  -harvel
     [This space for rent - 1 VE, Papyrus, or Indulgence]


ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Clarify Rule 459" by Elysion - Proposal 4114 adopted 2/25
  The Nomic Week begins at the beginning of Monday.

"Oligarchy Reform" (was "Undo Proposal 4104") by Elysion - Proposal 4111
    adopted 2/19
  Rule 594 (Proposals and Rule Changes) is increased to Power=2.
  An Oligarch may resign by announcing that e does so.
  Rule 1933 (Ordinary and Democratic Proposals) is amended to avoid the
    problematic "operation of" text.
  An Ordinary Proposal that fails quorum becomes Democratic, and its Voting
    Period is extended accordingly.

"Tweak Scoring Events" by Elysion - Proposal 4113 adopted 2/25
  Being the only Player to Vote FOR or AGAINST someone else's Proposal is worth
    only 2 Points, not 10.
  Gaining a Patent Title is not worth 5 Points any more.

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

"Banking Developments" by t - Proposal 4112 failed quorum 2/19 - became
    Democratic 2/20, but only if Proposal 4112 applies to it (see CFJs 1278
    and 1279)
  Bank Currency Recordkeepors may create and destroy that Currency in the
    Bank's holdings.
  Debts owed by the Bank must be announced before the Bank is obligated to pay
    them.

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Auction Fractional VEs" by Blob - Proposal 4117
  VEs are auctioned in units of the MUQ of VEs.

"Allow Tax Exemptions" by Murphy
  Rule 1853 allows part of an entity's Currency holdings to be tax-exempt.

"Clarity of Communication" by Goethe - Proposal 4115
  A Communication is a single declaration with a specific effect.
  A Communication has effect only if it has exactly one reasonable
    interpretation.
  A message is a (possibly empty) set of Collections to be sent to a Public
    Forum.
  A message's Communications have effect only if they have an unambiguous
    order.

"Create Bards" by Goethe
  Anyone may grant Patent Title of Bard With 2 Supporters, or With Support if
    both e and the Supporter are Bards.
  Anyone may revoke Patent Title of Bard With 3 Supporters, or With 2
    Supporters if both e and the Supporters are Bards.

"Fix double Auction debts" by Steve (duplicated by Goethe)
  Rule 1887 double-bills Auction winners - once explicitly, and once by
    requiring the Auctioneer to bill them.  The former clause is repealed.

"More Ways to Win (redux)" by Murphy
  [This was part of Proposal 4102, but was ineffective due to quoting obsolete
   text to replace.]
  If an Insane Proposal reaches Voting, but no one Votes FOR it, the Proposer
    Wins.

"Patch Up Dependent Actions" by Ziggy
  A Player may not Support emself.
  The Rule defining Dependent Actions is increased to Power=2.
  A Rule defining a specific Dependent Action may restrict the eligibility of
    Players to Support or Object to that action.

"The Speed of Light in a Vacuum" by Wes
  The speed of light in a vacuum ranges from 3 to 5, initially 3.9.

"VE Upkeep" by Blob - Proposal 4116
  The Treasuror's Budget contains the VE Upkeep, which is from 0 to 2 times the
    Basic Officer's Salary.
  The Treasuror may amend eir Budget's upkeeps Without 3 Objections.  E may
    still amend eir Budget's compensations With Support.
  At the beginning of the second month of each quarter, the Assessor bills each
    non-Bank entity for the VE Upkeep for each VE it owns.  If any part of such
    a debt remains outstanding for a week, the Assessor may forgive the rest of
    the debt and bill the entity for a corresponding quantity of VEs instead.
    (This clock stops running while the debt is disputed or the Player is On
    Hold.)

"Zombie Upkeep" (proto by Steve; duplicated and Proposed by Goethe) - Proposal
    4118
  Zombie upkeep is increased from one Indulgence per quarter to one Indulgence
    per month, and if the debt is not paid as soon as possible, then the Zombie
    is lost.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Acolytes and Zombies" by Ziggy
  Only Acolytes may own Zombies or bid on Zombies.

"Alternative OligarQueue" by Blob
  Each Player has an Oligarchy Priority, initially zero.
  A Player may increase eir Priority by spending Stems, or decrease it to zero
    by announcement.
  The Oligarchy is the six Players with highest Oligarchy Priority, with ties
    broken in favor of older changes.  The first is High, the next two are
    Middle, and the next three are Low.
  Each month, the High Oligarch's Priority becomes zero.
  Each week, all Oligarch Priorities double.

"A Synthetic Zombie" by Steve
  Frankie is a synthetic Zombie, deemed to be a Player and a Zombie.
  Monthly upkeep on a synthetic Zombie is 0.1 Indulgences, doubled for each
    full month since it was last Auctioned.  If monthly upkeep goes unpaid for
    a week, then the Master must give up the Zombie instead.
  The starting bid on a synthetic Zombie is 0.1 Indulgences, and a lack of bids
    triggers a new Auction rather than deregistration.

"Barring New Player Judges" by Stuart
  The Caller of a CFJ may bar all Players in eir Grace Period, in addition to
    barring three Players individually.  However, if this results in no
    eligible Judges, then the bar on Players in eir Grace Period is lifted
    first.

"Bonds" by Hooloovoo
  Bonds are Property, tracked by the Office of the Fed.
  Bonds cost 50 Stems each, have a term from 1 week to 1 year, and may be
    redeemed at the interest rate currently in effect for the Bond's term
    length.

"End the Popularity Contest" by Elysion
  Kudos are repealed.

"Fix exemptions bug" by Steve
  Only the Recordkeepor of a Currency may levy a tax on it.
  Rule 1853 allows part of an entity's Currency holdings to be tax-exempt.

"Generalize Auction Results" by Kelly
  Auctioned items are transferred by their owner, not by the Auctioneer.

"Group Bidding" by Blob
  A Player may transfer Stems to eir Group.
  A Group at least three months old and with at least three members may have a
    Role.
  Groups may bid in Auctions.
  When a Group wins an Oligarchy Auction, it must announce one of its members
    to become an Oligarch.

"Intrarole Stem Swaps" by Ziggy
  A Player may transfer Stems to another Player with the same Role.

"Make VEs Interesting" by Murphy
  VE supply is similar to Papyri, not to Indulgences.
  Bids in Oligarch Auctions are in VEs.

"No More Bait-and-Switch" by Ziggy
  The 72-hour Auction timer is reset, not only when a new high Bid is made, but
    also when an old high Bid is cancelled.

"Notices of Infraction" by Elysion
  A Notice of Infraction need not include the Rule defining the Infraction (but
    must still include sufficient detail to identify the offense).

"Restore Democracy, more or less?" by Kelly
  The Oligarchy is repealed.

"Roots" by Ziggy
  Roots are a Currency.  Roots may be bought from the Bank with Stems.  Stems
    may be bought from the Bank with Roots at least three months old.  Hence
    Stems may be traded indirectly:  buy Roots, trade Roots, sell Roots.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1265  "The Justiciar is required by the Rules to act in some way in
Dismissed  response to the Call for Judgement earlier in this email."
          2/4     Called by Wes
          2/4-10  Assigned to Kelly, who dismisses it
          2/14    Appealed by Murphy
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 991 (requiring the Clerk of the
            Courts to act upon a submitted CFJ) takes precedence over Rule 1831
            (requiring the Justiciar to perform the duties of the Clerk of the
            Courts for CFJs filed with em).
          Judge's argument (summary):  The statement of this CFJ may appear in
            different messages, so 'this email' does not have a fixed meaning.
          Counterargument:  It did have a fixed meaning at the time this CFJ
            was called, which is the only time relevant to Judgement.

CFJ 1266  "1.  That of the following two messages,
Dismissed  http://www.escribe.com/games/agora-business/m2253.html
           and
           http://www.escribe.com/games/agora-business/m2255.html
           exactly ONE legally registered Goethe as a player in the game of
           Agora. The other one is either incorrect or superfluous.
           2.  That at a time 1 minute immediately BEFORE the SEND date
           listed in Goethe's e-mail header for m2253, normalized to GMT as
           Feb 5 0:22:49 (anecdotal evidence available on request), Goethe
           unambiguously was NOT a player.
           3.  That at a time 1 minute immediately AFTER the latest
           distribution date of m2255 listed in e-scribe, normalized to GMT
           as Feb 5 as 1:19:24, Goethe unambiguously WAS a player.
           4.  That, from these time indications, rounding to the minute,
           Goethe's Window of Ambiguity of Status as Player (GWASP) extends
           ABSOLUTELY NO LONGER than between GMT 0:21:00 and GMT 1:21:00 on
           Feb 5, 2001.
           5.  That Goethe's instant of becoming a player lies unambiguously
           within es GWASP.
           5.  While judgements on timestamps or the legality of the first
           message (c.f. http://www.escribe.com/games/agora-official/m967.html)
           may narrow the extent of this GWASP, no judgement may extend it.
           6.  Therefore, irrespective of the EXACT moment of Goethe's
           registration, and independent of any decisions further refining
           the exact moment, any game events, payments or adjustments,
           mandated by the rules to occur to Goethe's status, which must
           happen WITHIN a time period following registration, must use a
           registration date for Goethe NO LATER THAN 1:21:00 Feb. 5, 2001 in
           determining time of occurrence.
           7.  Likewise, any game events, payments, or adjustments mandated
           by the rules to occur a certain time AFTER Goethe's registration
           must use a registration date for Goethe NO EARLIER THAN 0:21:00
           Feb. 5, 2001 in determining its time of occurrence."
          2/6     Called by Goethe
          2/7     Assigned to Crito, who dismisses it
          2/7-8   Appealed by Kelly, Ziggy, lee, and harvel
          2/9-16  Appeal assigned to Chuck, Steve, and Wes, who unanimously
                    move to sustain

CFJ 1267  "Syllepsis is a Scribe."
[TRUE]    2/6       Called by Grech
          2/7-9     Assigned to Blob, who Judges TRUE
          2/22      Appealed by Goethe, Crito, and Ziggy
          2/25-3/3  Appeal assigned to lee, Steve, and Wes, who unanimously
                      move to sustain

CFJ 1268  "Peekee has committed the Crime of Application Fraud as described in
[TRUE]     Rule 1626 by claiming that eir Application (included in Evidence
Appealed   below) was signed by Players who did not actually sign that
           Application."
          2/7   Called by Wes
          2/7   Assigned to lee, who Judges TRUE
          2/8   Appealed by Peekee
          2/10  Appeal assigned to Chuck, Steve, and (improperly) Wes
          2/15  Steve moves to overturn and reassign
          2/16  Appeal assigned to Chuck, Steve, and Elysion
          2/16  Chuck moves to overturn and reassign
          2/17  Elysion moves to overturn and reassign
          2/25  Reassigned to Razl
          Caller's argument (summary):  Peekee published a Dissenting Position,
            then changed it to Concurring and got some signatures, then sent
            the Dissenting copy by mistake.
          Counterargument:  X is the action Peekee performed.  Y is the action
            Peekee believed e was performing at the time.  Peekee believed that
            X was a Crime (or would have if anyone had pointed it out), but did
            not believe that Y was a Crime.  If eir belief about Y is what
            matters, then Rule 1575's last paragraph forgives Peekee.
          Commentary:  lee submitted eir Judgement early by mistake (by eir own
            admission) and had not yet addressed Peekee's defense.

CFJ 1272  "All Players always have at least one inherent right, regardless of
[TRUE]     any rule (for purposes of this statement, inherent right means a
           right that players have even when or if the rules do not explicitly
           grant them that right)."
          2/11     Called by Evantine
          2/11-18  Assigned to Chuck, who Judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  A Player can quit, even if the Rules
            forbid it.
          Counterargument:  The Zombies have "quit", but the Rules still regard
            them as Players.

CFJ 1274  "t's Order of Wed, 14 Feb 2001, 'I order everyone to make fewer
[TRUE]     bids in the next auction.' was improperly or invalidly executed."
          2/15     Called by Oerjan
          2/15-21  Assigned to Evantine, who Judges TRUE
          2/16     Evantine makes a Motion to emself that e issue a Judicial
                     Order, an Order to Compel, for the Clerk of the Courts to
                     stay t's Order as soon as possible; e then grants the
                     Motion and issues the Judicial Order
          2/21     Evantime Orders emself to vacate t's Order
          2/22     Appealed by Taral
          Judge's argument (summary):  The Rules do not require, permit, or
            describe this type of Order, so it is invalid.
          Counterargument (summary):  Game custom holds that arbitrary Private
            Orders are valid, unless Judged "improper" (a deliberately variable
            standard).
          Concurring argument (summary):  Players who made no bids in the
            previous auction were ordered by t to make a negative number of
            bids in the next auction.

CFJ 1275  "An entity is a Player if the Rules cannot distinguish that entity
[TRUE]     from a Player."
          2/19     Called by Goethe
          2/25-28  Assigned to Murphy, who Judges TRUE

CFJ 1276  "An entity is a Player if, and only if, the Rules cannot distinguish
           that entity from a Player."
          2/19  Called by Goethe
          2/25  Assigned to Lindrum

CFJ 1277  "Lindrum's message
<http://www.escribe.com/games/agora-business/m2571.html>
           was sent after the end of the Oligarch Auction announced in Murphy's
           message <http://www.escribe.com/games/agora-business/m2530.html>."
          2/25  Called by Ziggy
          2/25  Assigned to Grech
          Caller's argument (summary):  Prior to Lindrum's message, at least 72
            had elapsed since a new bid became the highest bid.

CFJ 1278  "The Assessor has announced the results of the voting on Proposal
           4111."
          2/21  Called by Murphy
          2/26  Assigned to Syllepsis
          Caller's argument (summary):  The Assessor's announcement specified
            the Vote count correctly, but specified the result of that Vote
            count (adoption or rejection) incorrectly.

CFJ 1279  "Proposal 4112 is Democratic."
[FALSE]   2/21      Called by Murphy
          2/26-3/2  Assigned to pTang, who Judges FALSE
          3/3       Appealed by Murphy
          Caller's argument (summary):  If CFJ 1278 is false, then so is this;
            otherwise, while Proposal 4111 is adopted too early to place a
            requirement on the Assessor to announce Proposal 4112's failing
            quorum, it may still cause Proposal 4112 to become Democratic upon
            the Assessor's announcement.
          Counterargument:  An announcement may trigger the final clause of
            Proposal 4112 only if the Assessor was required to make the
            announcement, and/or only if the Proposal failed quorum after
            Proposal 4112 took effect.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  As of the calling of the CFJ, the
            Assessor had not announced that Proposal 4112 failed quorum.
          Counterargument:  Part of the Assessor's message attempted to
            announce it, and got it wrong; but another part of the Assessor's
            message announced it correctly.

CFJ 1280  "The Articles of Confederation of the United Nomic DEAD Groups (The
           UNDEAD Agreement) is an agreement between Players."
          2/28  Called by Peekee
          3/3   Assigned to Oerjan
          3/4   Goethe, Syllepsis, and Ziggy sign this Application:
                  PUBLIC AGREEMENT, BINDING BY THE RULES
                   We, the Members of the Anemocrats, publicly agree that the
                   The Private, Binding Agreement knows as the Articles of
                   Confederation of the United Nomic Dead Groups affects the
                   Votes of the Anemocrats, and affected the Votes of the
                   Anemocrats from the time of the Group's Formation to (at
                   least) the time of the execution of this Application.

CFJ 1281  "The Private, Binding Agreement knows as the Articles of
           Confederation of the United Nomic Dead Groups affects the Votes of
           the Anemocrats."
          2/28  Called by Taral
          2/28  Taral moves that the Ordinancekeepor of the Anemocrats be
                  Ordered to publish the UNDEAD Agreement
