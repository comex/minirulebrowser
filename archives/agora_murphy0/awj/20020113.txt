  A message sent to a Discussion Forum may be public if it is also sent to a
    Public Forum.

"Fix Embezzlement" by Murphy
  An entity receiving Property from a valid but unauthorized transfer incurs a
    debt for its return, even if the transfer was unintentional.

"Fix the Speaker-Elect bug" by Steve - Proposal 4236
  The Speaker cannot be Electee to Speaker-Elect.  If e somehow becomes so, e

"MAKE INSANITY MORE FUN" by neil
  A Player's Votes on an Insane Proposal must be all the same (i.e. all FOR,
    all AGAINST, or all ABSTAIN).

"Omnibus Office Reform" by harvel - Proposal 4241
  An "epoch" is a week, month, quarter, or year.
  If the Speaker is not allowed to hold an Office, and the Office would
    otherwise be vacant, then the Office is vacant.
  Resigning Officer's successor has one week to consent.
  Resigning Oligarch's successor has one week to consent, and must pay 1 VE.
  The current Cabinet becomes the Inner Cabinet.  The Outer Cabinet consists of
    all Oligarchs who are not part of the Inner Cabinet.
  The Speaker shall announce when a Player becomes marvy.
  Members of the Outer Cabinet are marvy.
  An Officer who commits Failure to Report three weeks in a row may be cited
    for either Failure to Report or Dereliction of Duty, but not both.
  Rules defining Offices are conformed to this template:
    "The _____ is an office; its holder is recordkeepor of/for _____ and is
     responsible for _____.
    "The _____'s Weekly/Monthly Report shall include _____.
    "The _____ shall have a budget containing _____.   The _____ may <dependent
     action> replace eir budget with a proto-budget e publishes when e
     announces eir intent to do so."

  Some clauses are moved around.
  Identity of Vote Collector is fixed at beginning of Referendum.
  Formal definition of "Voter", "Prospective", and "Nominator".
  Cutoff for Challenges moved from Election procedure to Referendum procedure
    (since the Voting portion of an Election is a sub-class of Referendum).
  Elections may be Selfish (default; Nominate only yourself), Selfless
    (Nominate anyone but yourself), or Open (Nominate anyone), at the Vote
    Collector's discretion.

CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1331 "Steve is the Holder of the Office of Speaker-Elect."
[TRUE]   12/3       Called by neil
         12/3-12    Assigned to Syllepsis, who is recused
         12/21-1/4  Assigned to root, who Judges TRUE
         Judge's argument (summary):  Steve held this Office on November 21
           (CFJ 1332).  Between that time and the calling of this CFJ, nothing
           occurred that would cause Steve to cease holding this Office.

CFJ 1332 "Immediately after neil became Electee to the Office of
[FALSE]   Speaker-Elect (at approximately 00:23:21 on 21 Nov 2001 GMT),
Appealed  Steve held the Office of Speaker-Elect."
         12/8      Called by neil
         12/8-12   Assigned to Crito, who Judges FALSE
         12/12-13  Appealed by root, Murphy, and Michael
         12/21     Appeal assigned to root, Goethe, and Murphy
         1/4       root moves to overturn and reverse
         1/4       Goethe moves to overturn and reverse
         Judge's argument (summary):  Steve did not become Speaker-Elect on
           November 15 or on November 20.
         Justice root's refutation (summary):  Michael and Murphy declined to
           be Speaker-Elect at appropriate times.  Steve became Speaker-Elect
           on November 15, and continued to hold that Office after November 20.
         Relevant chronology:
           10/1   New quarter begins, triggering Speaker Transition.
           10/19  Speaker Transition announced.  solublefish becomes Speaker.
                    neil becomes non-Electee Speaker-Elect.
           11/12  solublefish gives up Speakership, triggering Speaker
                    Transition.
           11/12  neil Nominates for Speaker-Elect.
           11/13  Michael declines to be Speaker-Elect.
           11/15  Murphy declines to be Speaker-Elect.
           11/15  Speaker Transition announced.  neil becomes Tainted Speaker.
                    Steve becomes non-Electee Speaker-Elect.  (If Michael
                    and/or Murphy had not declined between 11/12 and now, then
                    this announcement would have been incorrect and thus
                    ineffective.)
           11/20  neil becomes Electee to Speaker-Elect.  Existence of Tainted
                    Speaker, plus existence of Electee to Speaker-Elect,
                    triggers Speaker Transition.  Holder of Speaker-Elect is
                    no longer determined by Order of Succession, which applies
                    only when there is no Electee to Speaker-Elect.
           11/21  Murphy attempts to decline to be Speaker-Elect.  However,
                    there is an Electee to Speaker-Elect, and Rule 786 only
                    considers declinations since there was last an Electee.
           11/22  Michael attempts to decline to be Speaker-Elect.  However,
                    there is an Electee to Speaker-Elect, and Rule 786 only
                    considers declinations since there was last an Electee.
         Argument for TRUE:  Order of Succession is a one-time effect that
           causes Steve to hold Speaker-Elect.  Steve then continues to hold
           Speaker-Elect till something else causes someone else to hold it.
           neil becoming Electee on 11/20 does not cause em to hold it, because
           Rule 1647 takes precedence over Rule 1555.  Steve holds
           Speaker-Elect at the time mentioned in the Statement.
         Argument for FALSE:  Order of Succession is a continuous effect that
           causes Steve to hold Speaker-Elect.  When Order of Succession ceases
           to apply, then Steve ceases to hold Speaker-Elect.  neil does not
           hold it, because Rule 1647 takes precedence over Rules 1006 and
           1555, and Rule 103 prevents neil from becoming holder of
           Speaker-Elect and ceasing to be Speaker.  No one holds Speaker-Elect
           at the time mentioned in the Statement.

CFJ 1333 "hooloovoo transferred 0.7 VEs, 1.81 Indulgences, and 3.15 Papyri to
[FALSE]   AgorEx Offshore just before eir most recent Deregistration."
         12/11     Called by root
         12/18-22  Assigned to Murphy, who Judges FALSE
         Judge's refutation (summary):  Hooloovoo had only 0.6 VEs at the time.

CFJ 1334 "Ten Land Auctions began on December 11, 2001 using VEs as the Auction
[FALSE]   Currencies."
         12/11     Called by root
         12/18-20  Assigned to Steve, who Judges FALSE
         Judge's refutation (summary):  root's description of the Depdendent
           Action e intended to perform was not unambiguous, because e did not
           specify which Bank Currency e intended to select.

CFJ 1335 "The Notice of Speaker Transition issued Sat, 8 Dec 2001 was incorrect
[TRUE]    in its particulars."
         12/12      Called by Crito
         12/21-1/4  Assigned to Goethe, who Judges TRUE
         1/10       Appealed by neil
         Caller's argument (summary):  Michael, not Steve, was Speaker-Elect at
           the time.  See the Judge's argument for CFJ 1332.
         Counterargument:  CFJ 1332 will be reversed on Appeal.
         Judge's argument (summary):  The message containing the Notice was
           clearly divided into several functional parts, so the Notice is only
           the two sentences explicitly labelled as such.  The reason for the
           Transition was specified before the Notice, not within it.

CFJ 1336 "Murphy declined the Office of Speaker-Elect in the message
[TRUE]    http://www.escribe.com/games/agora-business/m5768.html"
         12/12      Called by Murphy
         12/21-1/3  Assigned to Crito, who Judges TRUE
         Judge's argument (summary):  In effect, Taral asked Murphy "Would you
           like to decline the Office of Speaker-Elect?" and Murphy replied
           "Yes", and this was effective.

CFJ 1337 "hooloovoo transferred 1.81 Indulgences and 3.15 Papyri to AgorEx
[TRUE]    Offshore just before eir most recent Deregistration."
         12/23  Called by root
         1/4-7  Assigned to Steve, who Judges TRUE
         Judge's argument (summary):  Hooloovoo explicitly stated these
           amounts, so CFJ 1307 (holding that "all" by itself is ineffective)
           does not apply.

CFJ 1338 "Two Speaker Transitions have commenced since 18-Nov-01, and neither
[TRUE]    have concluded."
         1/4     Called by Goethe
         1/7-11  Assigned to Murphy, who Judges TRUE
         Caller's argument (summary):  An incomplete Speaker Transition does
           not prevent an additional Speaker Transition from commencing.
         Relevant chronology:
           11/15  Speaker Transition announced.  neil becomes Tainted Speaker.
                    Steve becomes non-Electee Speaker-Elect.
           11/20  neil becomes Electee to Speaker-Elect.  Existence of Tainted
                    Speaker, plus existence of Electee to Speaker-Elect,
                    triggers Speaker Transition.  GWotO has not yet published a
                    correct Notice of Speaker Transition (CFJ 1335).
           1/1    Quarterly Speaker Transition commences.  GWotO has not yet
                    published a correct Notice of Speaker Transition.

CFJ 1339 "At the time of the Speaker Transition occurring at 01:27:48 on 10
          January 2002, neil held the Office of Speaker-Elect."
         1/10  Called by neil
         Caller's argument (summary):  CFJ 1335 was based on an incorrect
           determination of the identity of the Speaker.  On December 8, a
           correct Notice of Speaker Transition made Steve Speaker, with neil
           still Electee to Speaker-Elect and now its holder as well.  neil
           continued to hold this Office until the Speaker Transition on
           January 10.
         Counterargument:  CFJ 1335 was Judged TRUE on grounds other than the
           identity of the Speaker.

CFJ 1340 "At the time of the Speaker Transition occurring at 01:27:48 on 10
          January 2002, neil was Electee to the Office of Speaker-Elect."
         1/10  Called by neil
         Caller's argument (summary):  CFJ 1335 was based on an incorrect
           determination of the identity of the Speaker.  On December 8, a
           correct Notice of Speaker Transition made Steve Speaker, with neil
           still Electee to Speaker-Elect and now its holder as well.  neil
           continued to be Electee until the Speaker Transition on January 10.
         Counterargument:  CFJ 1335 was Judged TRUE on grounds other than the
           identity of the Speaker.

CFJ 1341 "neil committed the Crime of Misrepresentation in the message
          with Message-ID <15422.32050.200019.402505@tarski.2y.net>."
         1/11  Called by Murphy
         Caller's argument (summary):  neil publically stated "Read the Ruleset
           Week will be in January this year!"
         Counterarguments:  Determinations of how to apply the Rules are not
           statements of fact, for the purpose of Misrepresentation.  The
           falsity of neil's statement is not certain until January ends, as
           "Read the Ruleset Week" could be re-defined before then.

ERRATA
------

12/9   Taral won the Looting Auction for S., not Peekee.

12/11  Land Auctions did not begin (CFJ 1334).

12/12  Nominations opened for Assistant Director of Personnel.  Steve did not
         become Speaker on December 8 due to incomplete Notice of Speaker
         Transition (CFJ 1335), so Speaker neil's announcement was valid.
