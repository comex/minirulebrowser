ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Adjust Elections" by Murphy - Proposal 4103 adopted 1/14
  Terms of Service expire on the 15th of the month, not the 1st.
  Elections must be initiated as soon as possible after an Office comes to be
    without an Electee.

"Billing winning bidders" by Steve - Proposal 4094 adopted 1/14
  Rather than creating "liabilities" by announcing winning Bids, the Auctioneer
    simply bills for them.

"Fixing Rule 1840" by Elysion - Proposal 4096 adopted 1/14
  If an Inciting to Riot penalty is postponed due to a Revolt whose results
    remain undetermined, and the Revolt succeeds, the penalty is cancelled.

"Making Stems Transferrable" by Blob - Proposal 4095 adopted 1/14
  Stems may be freely transferred.

"More Ways to Win" by Murphy - Proposal 4102 adopted 1/14
  Not being Immaculate is a Win-Preventing Condition.
  Being the only Immaculate Player is a Win Condition.  Upon such a Win, the
    Herald shall expunge N Blots per Player, where N is just enough to make at
    least one other Player Immaculate.
  An Insane Proposal distributed but receiving no FOR Votes is a Win Condition.

"Spelling Fixes, Part 1 of 2" by Murphy - Proposal 4099 adopted 1/14
  Fix typos in the following Rules:
  Rule 1926 (The Official Secrets Act)
  Rule 1727 (Happy Birthday)
  Rule 1948 (Zombie Transfer Tax)
  Rule 1789 (Cantus Cygneus)
  Rule 1755 (No Non-Player Responsibilities)

  Rule 1598 (Property Transfers)
  Rule 1887 (Default Procedure for Auctions)
  Rule 1924 (Living Twice Shall Have Its Price)
  Rule 1446 (Contests)

"Spelling Fixes, Part 2 of 2" by Murphy - Proposal 4098 adopted 1/14
  Fix spelling errors in Rules 1664 (Rebellion) and 1937 (Filling Vacancies in
    the Oligarchy).

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

"Compensate for Complacent Oligarchy" by Murphy - Proposal 4101 rejected 1/14
  If an Ordinary Proposal fails Quorum, then it becomes Democratic and goes
    through another week of Voting.

"Scores" by t - Proposal 4097 failed quorum 1/14
  Winning a contested Election is worth 15 Points, not 10.  Losing a contested
    Election is worth 7 Points if you receive at least many Votes as there were
    Candidates.  However, for the purpose of both of these awards, Candidates
    receiving no Votes are omitted.
  No penalty from resigning from an Office.
  Adoption of one's Proposal is worth 9 Points minimum, plus 29 if you have
    never had a Proposal adopted before.
  1 Point for a Proposal that attains Quorum but receives exactly X times as
    many FOR as AGAINST Votes, where X is the Proposal's Adoption Index.
  Being the only Player to Vote FOR or AGAINST a Proposal is worth 4 Points,
    not 10.

"The Dole" by Murphy - Proposal 4100 rejected 1/14
  Players may go On The Dole, forfeiting eir Minimum Income to automatically
    expunge a Blot per month.

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Alternate Adoption System" by Elysion - Proposal 4104 Voting Period ended
1/12 - see CFJ 1261
  All Proposals have an Adoption Index of 1, but (if adopted) a Power equal to
    their Voting Index.  For instance, if a Proposal attempts to amend both a
    Power=1 Rule and a Power=2 Rule, and it is adopted 7 FOR to 6 AGAINST (thus
    a Voting Index of 7/6), then the first amendment succeeds but the second
    fails.

"Longer Holidays" by Steve - Proposal 01-003
  The Christmas holiday begins on December 24 (not December 25) and lasts until
    the first Nomic Week beginning after January 2 (not until January 1).
  Holidays may last up to 17 days.

"Oerjan's Fix Roles" by Elysion - Proposal 535
  Organizations may transfer eir Stems to Players within seven days of
    receiving them.
  Debts invalidated by the adoption of "Roles" are reinstated in Stems.
  Rule 1936 (Auctioning Positions in the Oligarchy) has the typo "On
    Politicians" corrected.

"Pragmatic Oligarchy" by Steve - Proposal 01-005
  An Oligarch loses eir position due to Inactivity, Zombiehood, Blots,
    Speakership, or rotation only when the Grand Warden of the Oligarchy
    announces it.
  Oligarchy Auction is moved out of Rule 1937 and into a separate Rule.
  Winning bids in an Oligarchy Auction become debts.
  Rule 1961 (a Rule with one-time application only) is repealed.
 
"The CotC's Budget" by Blob
  The CotC's Budget includes the Class of each Crime and Infraction.
  The Electee to CotC may amend eir Budget with 2 Support, at most once per 30
    days, and not changing any Class by more than 1.
  The Class of Crimes is from 0 to 15.
  The Class of Infractions is from 0 to 5, except Dereliction of Duty whose
    Class may be set as if it were a Crime.
  All current Classes are repealed and put into the initial CotC's Budget.

"Well fix it, dear Henry!" by Blob - Proposal 01-002
  Notary is an Office.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Undo Proposal 4104" by Elysion
  Proposal 4104 (if adopted; see CFJ 1261) causes all Proposals to have an
    Adoption Index of 1, but a Power equal to their Voting Index.  A side
    effect is that all Proposals are Ordinary by default.  This proto undoes
    that change, and increases Rule 594's (Proposals and Rule Changes) Power
    to 2.
  An Oligarch may resign by announcing that e does so.
  Rule 1933 (Ordinary and Democratic Proposals) is amended to avoid the
    problematic "operation of" text.
  The Speaker may make a Proposal Democratic without Objection from an
    Oligarch.  (Previously, the requirement was With 3 Supporters.)
  An Ordinary Proposal that fails quorum becomes Democratic, and its Voting
    Period is extended accordingly.

CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1254  "Peekee possesses at least one Voting Token."
[TRUE]    11/20    Called by Murphy
Appealed  1/6-14   Assigned to David, who defaults
          1/14-15  Assigned to pTang, who Judges TRUE
          1/15-17  Appealed by harvel, Blob, and Oerjan
          1/17     Appeal assigned to Chuck, Steve, and Wes
          1/18     Steve moves to overturn and reverse
          1/21     Wes moves to overturn and reassign
          1/24     Chuck moves to overturn and dismiss
          1/24     Reassigned to Ziggy
          Caller's argument (summary):  Murphy attempted to create a Voting
            Token and transfer it to Peekee.
          Justice Steve's refutation (summary):  Bank Currency of VTs
            destroyed earlier.  Player-minted Currency invalid because Murphy
            did not specify a Recordkeepor or MUQ.  Player-created Property
            invalid because Property may only be created by methods defined by
            the Rules.  Extra-Ruleset entities invalid because Murphy did not
            physically create anything.
          Justice Wes's refutation (summary):  Even if Murphy created an
            imaginary VT by announcing such, no one knows what happened to it
            after that.

CFJ 1258  "Peekee is the Notary."
[TRUE]    12/18    Called by Murphy
Appealed  1/8-14   Assigned to lee, who Judges TRUE
          1/14     Appealed by Crito, Palnatoke, Elysion, and Blob
          1/15-16  Blob and Steve sign Dissenting Opinion
          1/16     Appeal assigned to Chuck, Steve, and Wes
          1/16     Steve moves to overturn and reverse
          1/21     Wes moves to overturn and reassign
          1/22     Chuck moves to overturn and reassign
          1/22     Reassigned to loh
          Caller's argument (summary):  Notary ceased to be an Office on 5/8,
            at which time Blob held it.  Had it remained an Office, a
            subsequent Election would have transferred it to Peekee.  Can that
            alleged Election be interpreted as effective anyway?
          Judge's argument (summary):  Yes, the Rules don't say otherwise.
          Justice Steve's refutation (summary):  No, Rule 1586 caused the
            position of Notary to cease to exist when its definition was
            repealed.
          Justice Wes's refutation (summary):  "Notary" may remain usefully
            defined by natural language.
          Counterargument:  No, Rule 1586 causes Blob to remain the Notary
            until the Rules change.

CFJ 1259  "If this statement is true, Peekee is owed 100 Stems."
          1/18  Called by Peekee
          1/18  Assigned to Murphy
          Caller's argument (summary):  FALSE would be self-contradictory.
          Counterargument:  TRUE would falsely imply that Peekee was owed 100
            Stems, so dismissal is appropriate.

CFJ 1260  "Elysion committed the Crime of Misrepresentation in eir message 
           dated Mon, 08 Jan 2001 14:54:47 -0500."
          1/21     Called by Elysion
          1/22-27  Assigned to Steve, who proto-Judges TRUE
          Commentary:  Elysion and Assessor t established a private code
            equating AGAINT with FOR.  Elysion then claimed to Vote 3xAGAINT
            Proposal 4104.  Elysion's clear and admitted intent was to be
            perceived by most Players as Voting 3xAGAINST.  If this counts as
            presenting that information as correct, then the Statement is TRUE;
            if the listener is solely responsible for incorrect interpretation
            based on incomplete information, then the Statement is FALSE.

CFJ 1261  "Proposal 4104 passed."
          1/23  Called by Elysion
          1/23  Assigned to harvel
          Commentary:  Elysion and Assessor t established a private code
            equating AGAINT with FOR.  Elysion then claimed to Vote 3xAGAINT
            Proposal 4104.  If AGAINT is an obvious synonym of FOR, then the
            Statement is TRUE; otherwise, whether Elysion Voted 3xAGAINST or
            did not Vote at all, the Statement is FALSE.

ERRATA
------

t lost eir Oligarch position on 12/14/00 due to Blots, so High Oligarch Elysion
  did not lose eir position on 12/15/00.  Nevertheless, the announcement on
  01/14/01 of an Oligarch Auction was effective - the vacancies were left by
  Blob and t, rather than Blob and Elysion, but the number of them was correct.
