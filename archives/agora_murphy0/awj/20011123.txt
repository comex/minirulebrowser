REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"A REVOLUTION IN ENTITLEMENTS" by Goethe - Proposal 4232 improperly Aborted;
    Proposal 4235
  The Assessor shall destroy 50% of all non-Bank VE holdings (exempting 0.5 VEs
    per Player) and creating an equal quantity in the Bank's possession.

"Read the Ruleset Week" by harvel - Proposal 4230 improperly Aborted; Proposal
    4233
  An index of 4 is greater than any other index (including Unanimity).
  Each Emperor has power 4 and takes precedence over the Rules.  
  harvel is the one and only Emperor.
  This Rule may not be repealed or amended.  
  This Rule takes precedence over every other Rule.

"Stems Shall Grow" by Goethe - Proposal 4231 improperly Aborted; Proposal 4234
  If two entities owe the same amount of some fungible Property to each other,
    then either one may satisfy both debts by announcing it.
  A Land Auctioneer may (with 2 Supporters) change the bidding Currency from
    Indulgences to a different Bank Currency.
  Each month, the Weather is (20% chance Foul, 30% Fair, 20% Plenty, 30% same
    as previous month).  Upon the Treasuror's announcement:
      X = number of Players * Minimum Income.
      X Bank Stems are decreased by 50% if Foul, increased by 50% if Plenty.
  The initial Weather is Fair.
  The Treasuror may not cause the Bank to mint Stems.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"The Vanishing Auctioneer" by Goethe
  An Auctioneer who fails to announce the winning bids in time commits the
    Class 3 Infraction of Losing the Gavel.  If conducting the Auction is the
    duty of an Office, then the Auctionner is automatically retired (removed?),
    and any subsequent holder of the Office may announce the Auction results.
  If the results of an Auction are not announced ASAP after the latest possible
    date that the Auction could have ended, then the Auction is deemed to have
    no winner.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1324 "Steve is NOT the Limited Executor for either Peekee or Ian."
[FALSE]  11/6      Called by Crito
         11/7-15   Assigned to pTang, who defaults
         11/15-16  Assigned to root, who Judges FALSE
         Caller's argument (summary):  Looting Auctions for Peekee and Ian have
           ended, but the Auctioneer has not yet announced the results.
         Judge's refutation (summary):  Rule 1887 defines winning Bids once the
           Auction ends, independent of the Auctioneer's announcement.  The
           Auction for Peekee is in question (see CFJ 1327), but the Auction
           for Ian is not.

CFJ 1325 "The listed Trading Accounts on the AgorEx web page are sufficient
[TRUE]    evidence of an Agreement between each listed Player and Lindrum in
          which the Player may demand that Lindrum pay em the specified amounts
          at any time."
         11/11     Called by Taral
         11/11-13  Assigned to Goethe, who Judges TRUE

CFJ 1326 "On or around 19:40:00 12 Nov 2001, neil successfully Nominated for
[TRUE]    the Office of Speaker-Elect."
         11/12     Called by neil
         11/12     Incorrectly assigned to Oerjan, who is On Hold
         11/14-15  Assigned to Murphy, who Judges TRUE

CFJ 1327 "A looting auction for Peekee began on or about Sun 14 Oct 2001."
[FALSE]  11/15     Called by Goethe
         11/15-21  Assigned to Crito, who Judges FALSE
         Caller's argument (summary):  Peekee had Blots at the time, so the
           announced starting bid was incorrect.

CFJ 1328 "The AgoraEx exists in the eyes of the Rules."
         11/16     Called by Goethe
         11/18-20  Assigned to Syllepsis, who dismisses it
         11/21     Appealed by Taral, root, Crito, and harvel
         11/21-23  Appeal assigned to Steve, root, and Murphy, who unanimously
                     move to overturn and reassign
         Caller's argument (summary):  The AgoraEx is a series of binding
           agreements between Players, but was not an entity with an Executor.
         Judge's refutation (summary):  The Rules have no eyes.

CFJ 1329 "neil is Speaker-Elect."
         11/20  Called by neil
