  VE holdings are multiplied by six.
  VE debts are multiplied by five, except those due to Rule 1946 prior to July
    2001 which are forgiven.

"Manifesting Destiny" by Goethe
  When Aether is assigned a new type due to Exploration, instead of:
    * 0.10 probability it becomes Farmland, no subtype;
    * 0.30 probability it becomes Water, no subtype.
  it has:
    * 0.15 probability it becomes the same type and subtype
           as the land at the location of the exploring Player;
    * 0.05 probability it becomes Farmland, no subtype;
    * 0.20 probability it becomes Water, no subtype.


PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Rig Looting Auctions" by harvel
  If a Dissolute becomes a Player before the Notary initiates a Looting
    Auction, then the Notary shall not initiate a Looting Auction.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1320 "There do not exist any Bonds issued by Steve's Bond Scam Contest."
[FALSE]  9/12     Called by neil
         9/12-17  Assigned to Crito, who Judges FALSE
         10/1     Appealed by Murphy and neil
         Caller's argument (summary):  Steve's Bond Scam Contest (if it exists
           at all) is neither a Player nor an entity with an Executor, so Bonds
           issued by it no longer satisfy Rule 1966 (a).
         Judge's refutation (summary):  Rule 1966 (a) need only hold when the
           Bond is issued.

CFJ 1323 "If each of two entities owes the other some amount of the same
[FALSE]   fungible property, then by agreement of the Prime Executors for
          the two entities and without either entity forgiving the other's
          debt: (a) if the debts are of equal amounts, both may be
          satisfied; and (b) if the amount of one debt is less than that
          of the other, then the amount of the latter debt may be reduced
          by that of the former, and the former debt may be satisfied."
         9/29        Called by harvel
         9/29        harvel moves for annotation of Rule 1596
         9/29-10/10  Assigned to Murphy, who defaults
         10/10-16    Assigned to Goethe, who Judges FALSE and denies Motion
        Caller's argument (summary):  The entities may mutually deem that
          appropriate transfers have occurred, without actually making any
          transfers.
        Judge's refutation (summary):  Transfers and debts are regulated, and
          thus cannot be arbitrarily deemed nor combined.  Any amount of the
          property may be repeatedly transferred to accomplish satisfaction,
          but the statement is false when neither entity possesses any amount
          of the property.  The Recordkeepor would still be required to record
          any deemed transfers.  Mutual agreement of satisfaction fits the
          definition of forgiveness, even if the entities don't call it that.

         Notary, but e lost this privilege on October 1 due to quarterly
