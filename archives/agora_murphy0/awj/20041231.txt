"Clean up Monk reporting" by OscarMeyr - Proposal 4614 failed quorum 9/21 -
    Complacent Corporation - Proposal 4616 adopted 10/1
  Repeal a remaining reference to Monks.

"Crashing the Party" by Goethe - Proposal 4630 adopted 12/19
  New Card "Chaos Apple" (Handed[5], Delayed[7], Kallesti!; once a quarter,
    playing this card requires the Deckmastor to transfer all non-Deck cards
    to a temporary Gambler, Fate, then transfer then back randomly so that
    each Gambler's hand size is the same as before; if exactly one player
    publicly claims to be The Prettiest One after this card is played but
    before the scrambling begins, then e shall get this card).

"Crimson Go" by Goethe - Proposal 4624 adopted 11/20
  Initiative is a player switch (Gote, Sente).
  Rebellion resets all players to Gote.
  VPDP = Potential for Shareholders, 1 for other players.
  One Takeover Proposal may be submitted per month.  It must specify a set of
    Corporate Raiders from 1/3 to 1/2 the number of active noisy players at
    the time of submission.  All Takeover Proposals are Democratic and Sane.
  At the beginning of a Takeover Proposal's voting period, all players lose
    Sente.
  If a Takeover Proposal is adopted, all Corporate Raiders gain Sente.  If
    it is rejected, all other players gain Sente.

"Drinks on the House" by Murphy - Proposal 4628 adopted 12/19
  Expunge all blots due to Apathy in the Herald's election ending November 21.

"Limit Surprises" by root - Proposal 4627 adopted 12/3

"No Point Anymore" by Goethe - Proposal 4614 adopted 10/10
  The Maximum Hand Size may be from 2 to 10 (rather than 3 to 10).
  The Minimum Hand Size may be from 2 to 10, default 2.
  The Deckmastor's Budget includes one to three Winning Hands, each at least
    two Cards larger than the Maximum Hand Size.
  A Gambler whose Hand is exactly a Winning Hand has 72 hours to announce
    it.  If the announcement is false, e loses a random card.  If it is true,
    e Wins, and gains the Boon of Pokerface and the Patent Title of Champion.
  Flux is a Gambler switch (Free, Frozen).
  One week after a true announcement, all Gamblers except the Deck are
    frozen, and lose random cards to reduce their hands to the Minimum Hand
    Size.  The Winner then gains cards up to the Maximum Hand Size, and all
    Gamblers are unfrozen.
  If there is no win in six months, then any Gambler may announce a Skunk,
    which triggers the freezing process.
  The initial Winning Hands are
    Three Trios: (Distrub-u-Matic, Absolv-o-Matic, Debate-o-Matic)x3
    Dead Man's Hand:  Dud, Dud, Dud, Dud, Dud, Dud, Dud
  The Team with the most points gets the usual benefits of a Team Win.

    Contests, the Patent Title of Admiral, and various Score-related
    Cards and other rule effects.

  Each office, plus the Speakership, increases the player's effective Maximum
    Hand Size by one.

  Instead of being zeroed each month, Voting Potentials are halved (and
    rounded down to an integer).

"Powered Cards" by root - Proposal 4631 adopted 12/19
  New Card property "Powered[X]".  The Card's Power is X.  Exploit requires
    additional fee of X-1 unless it explicitly specifies otherwise.
  Debate-o-Matic becomes Powered[2].
  The Power of Rule 2067 (Cards in Play) is changed to 2, so that its
    assignment of Power to Debate-o-Matic is effective.

"Quorum for Referenda and Elections" by Murphy - Proposal 4629 adopted 12/19
  Quorum for Referenda and Elections is 1/3 of voters, rather than 1/2.

"Some card fixes" by Goethe - Proposal 4626 adopted 11/20
  The Power of Rule 2067 (Cards in Play) is increased from 1 to 2, so that
    Debate-o-Matic can be effective.

  An explicit definition of Political Charge is added to Rule 2052 (Voting
    Potential).

    RedKnight, and Sherlock.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Boons for Proposals" by OscarMeyr
  Boon of Right of Passage for adoption of an interested proposal.
  Albatross of Left of Passage for rejection of an interested proposal.

"Card Stasis" by Eris
  Replace the Card "Player Stasis" (temporarily preventing a player from
    playing Cards) with "Card Stasis" (temporarily preventing a Card from
    being played).

"Cards for Proposals" by OscarMeyr
  When a proposal is adopted, the proposer gains a pending draw.  Hand limit
    applies only if the proposal was disinterested.

"Clarify Ineffectiveness" by Murphy
  Naughty proposals are not implemented, even if adopted (but may trigger
    Rule-based side effects).
  Proposals attempting to change votes, or offer bribes for voting FOR or
    AGAINST, are naughty.

"Clarify Rule 1006" by Murphy
  Replace "shall be held" with "shall become held" in the Speaker-is-
    default-office-holder clause.

"Crimson Permanent Assurance" by Murphy
  Repeal Cards, including Shares.
  Initiative is a player switch (Gote, Sente).  Shareholders are players
    with Sente.
  Rebellion resets all players to Gote, instead of returning all Shares
    to the Deck.
  VPOP = 1 for Shareholders, 0 otherwise.
  VPDP = 2+Potential for Shareholders, 1+Potential for other players.
  One Takeover Proposal may be submitted per month.  It must specify a set
    of Corporate Raiders, including the submitter, and from 1/3 to 1/2 the
    number of active noisy players at the time of submission.  It must have
    AI >= 2.
  If a Takeover Proposal is adopted, all Corporate Raiders gain Sente.  If
    it is rejected, all other players gain Sente.

"Golden Handcuffs" by Riail
  New Card "Golden Handcuffs" (Limited [Shareholders]; players gain N kudos
    upon a Turning of the Parchment, where N = eir largest Share card; if
    Corporate Bankruptcy is played, they lose N kudos instead, but eir kudos
    do not go negative).

"Power Limitations"
  If a Rule with Power = M defines a Nomic Property as N Constrained, then
    that property's value can only be changed by the direct action of an
    instrument with Power >= P, or by a mechanism explicitly and directly
    described in a Rule with Power >= P, where P = min(N, M).

"War on Apathy" by Murphy
  The Infraction of Apathy is renamed Voter Apathy.
  When an election ends with no candidates, anyone that could have nominated
    someone but didn't commits the Infraction of Nominator Apathy.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

Requests for ineligibility:

12/10  Kolja (called before January 15, 2005)

CFJ 1517  "Claustronomic is not currently an Agoran Contest."
[TRUE]    7/29       Called by Goethe; part of Linked CFJs 1517 - 1518
          7/31-15    Assigned to root, who is recused
          8/1        root attempts to transfer to RedKnight, pending consent
          8/15-29    Assigned to t, who is recused
          9/5-19     Assigned to Sir Toby, who is recused
          9/19-24    Assigned to Sherlock, who is recused
          9/26-10/7  Assigned to Michael, who judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Goethe resigned as Contestmaster,
            and the Regulations do not specify a replacement.

CFJ 1518  "Elysion was awarded 5 points on or about 29-Jul-04."
[FALSE]   7/29       Called by Goethe; part of Linked CFJs 1517 - 1518
          7/31-15    Assigned to root, who is recused
          8/1        root attempts to transfer to RedKnight, pending consent
          8/15-29    Assigned to t, who is recused
          9/5-19     Assigned to Sir Toby, who is recused
          9/19-24    Assigned to Sherlock, who is recused
          9/26-10/7  Assigned to Michael, who judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Elysion was awarded 5 points in
            Claustronomic, and the Scorekeepor's Budget awards equal points
            in Agora without requiring Claustronomic to be a Contest.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Agora deems that Claustronomic does
            not exist, and also that the point award in Claustronomic does
            not exist.

CFJ 1522  "A Player may NOT draw two cards without fee by playing It's A
[TRUE]     Surprise, if eir hand size is above the maximum."
          Part of Linked CFJs 1522 - 1523
          10/26    Called by Goethe
          11/6-10  Assigned to root, who judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  It's a Surprise waives the fee, but
            not the hand size requirement.

CFJ 1523  "If It's A Surprise is played when the hand size is above the
[TRUE]     maximum, the play wholly fails."
          Part of Linked CFJs 1522 - 1523
          10/26    Called by Goethe
          11/6-10  Assigned to root, who judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  See CFJ 1522.  It's a Surprise does
            not directly cause draws, but simply removes some restrictions
            from the usual draw mechanism.
          Judge's argument (summary):  The exploit is the draw itself, not
            activation of an ongoing permission which may be used later, so
            It's a Surprise cannot be played when the hand size is above the
            maximum, and the statement is vacuously true.

CFJ 1524  "A Corporate Bankruptcy card has been legally dealt to root."
[FALSE]   11/4     Called by Goethe
          11/6-12  Assigned to Maud, who judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Random card selections were performed
            before root drew a card.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  The random selection must be performed
            after the draw.

CFJ 1525  "The Patent Title of Champion defined in R2075 is different from
[FALSE]    the previous Patent Title of Champion."
          11/15     Called by OscarMeyr
          11/20-27  Assigned to RedKnight, who judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  The current title's purpose (to
            indicate the latest winner) is different from the previous title's
            purpose (to indicate winners other than the latest).
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Patent Titles are defined as "a legal
            recognition of a person's distinction", and the titles have no
            difference in this regard.

CFJ 1526  "No player's Voting Potential has increased due to Proposal 4618
[TRUE]     (Battery packs)."
          11/20       Called by Murphy
          11/20-12/4  Assigned to Kolja, who defaults
          12/5-13     Assigned to Riail, who judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1561 (Illegality of Bonus Clauses)
            makes the proposal ineffective.

CFJ 1527  "Goethe has nine Pennies."
          12/14  Called by root
          12/19  Assigned to Murphy
          Caller's argument (summary):  One of the Pennies would have been an
            effect of the adoption of Proposal 4618.  See CFJ 1526.
