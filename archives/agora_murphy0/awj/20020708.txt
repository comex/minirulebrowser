    actual/potential Stem debts were Proposed out of existence.)

"Eligibility Fix" by Steve - Proposal 4343

"Fix Rule 594" by root

"Fix Wins" by Murphy
  The provisions of Rule 1638 (Announcing a Win) are moved into Rule 112 (Ways

"Overhaul Parliamentary" by OscarMeyr

  Player Votes are counted according to what would have been legal if the
    Proposal had been Sane.

"Pragmatic Judge Selection" by root - Proposal 4342
  Players ineligible to Judge due to Rule 1871 (Turns for All) are Turning
    Around and Around.

"Sheeting Home the Blame" by Steve
  Persistent Indebtedness is postponed when the debtor (not eir Executor) is
    non-active.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Accusation and Sentencing Reform" by harvel
  Sentencing Orders are a separate class of Order.
  All offenses (Crimes and Infractions) are reported via Notice of Accusation.
  Rule 1814 (Timing of Penalties for Crimes and Infractions) is merged into
    Rule 1503 (Crimes and Infractions).
  Sentencing Orders shall be restricted to what is necessary (as well as
    sufficient) to impose the penalty.
  A Notice of Accusation for a Crime is presumptively invalid, and must be
    proven true via CFJ.  All other Notices of Accusation are presumptively
    valid.
  Rules 1812 (Notices of Infraction) and 1816 (No Double Jeopardy for Crimes)
    are merged into Rule 1504 (Sentencing Orders, renamed "Notices of
    Accusation").

"Alternative Weather Determination" by Sir Toby
  The probability of Foul, Fair, or Plenty Weather is proportional to the Stem
    holdings of the Bank, other non-Player entities, and Players, respectively.

"balancing the powers of roles" by Craig
  A scribe's third and subsequent Rubberstamping each month costs half the
    Proposal's Distribution Fee.
  A Politician may Encourage Debate on a distributed Proposal with the support
    of an Acolyte or Politician, plus one more for each Proposal on which e has
    previously Encouraged Debate that week.  Such a Proposal has its Voting
    Period extended by one day, and becomes Parliamentary.  This can only be
    done once per Proposal.

"Encourage Parliamentary Proposals" by OscarMeyr
  Adoption of a Parliamentary Proposal is worth 10 Points, rather than twice
    the number of AGAINST Votes.

"Fight for Your Right to Party" by Murphy
  On Agora's Birthday, the Bank incurs debts, rather than the Payroll Clerk
    transferring anything directly.

"Fix Rule 1439" by Murphy
  Rule 1439 (Blots Due to a CFJ) applies only to Rule violations for which no
    other Blot penalty is defined.

"Optional Pay Out and Bill" by Murphy
  When a Player pays out or bills Property as explicitly permitted by the
    Rules, a corresponding debt is created.

"Public Actions" by harvel
  A Public Action is an action defined as such by the Rules.
  A Player is authorized to perform a Public Action, unless otherwise
    specified.
  An authorized Player performs a Public Action by announcing that e does so.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1379 "root committed the Crime of Misrepresentation when e sent a message
[FALSE]   with the subject 'Transfers' to Crito and t on Mon, 27 May 2002
          22:36:41 -0400."
         5/28    Called by t
         6/5-11  Assigned to OscarMeyr, who Judges FALSE
         Caller's argument (summary):  root claimed to satisfy a debt that e
           knew did not exist.
         Judge's refutation (summary):  It is reasonably possible that root
           believed the debt existed, given the recent high volume of activity.

CFJ 1380 "The player Goethe has committed four counts of the Class Four Crime
[FALSE]   of Misrepresentation."
         5/30   Called by Craig
         6/8-9  Assigned to Steve, who Judges FALSE
         Caller's argument (summary):  Goethe claimed to satisfy debts that did
           not exist, but may soon, when e knew they would not soon exist.
         Judge's refutation (summary):  See CFJ 1382.

CFJ 1382 "Steve has committed Misrepresentation."
[FALSE]  5/30   Called by Craig
         6/8-9  Assigned to Sir Toby, who Judges FALSE
         Caller's argument (summary):  Steve claimed to satisfy debts that did
           not exist, but may soon, when e knew they would not soon exist.
         Judge's refutation (summary):  The debts could have come into
           existence soon afterward, e.g. if a Proposal combating the effects
           of Proposal 4318 were adopted.

CFJ 1383 "root's transfer of an instance of a nameless currency to nothing was
[FALSE]   valid."
         5/30   Called by Craig
         6/8-9  Assigned to root, who Judges FALSE
         Judge's refutation (summary):  "Nothing" is not an entity, and thus
           it is an invalid transferee.

CFJ 1384 "Craig's transfer of an instance of a nameless currency to the name
Dismiss   'Beverly' was valid."
         5/30    Called by Craig
         6/8-16  Assigned to Goethe, who Judges DISMISS
         6/10    Goethe Orders Craig to provide evidence and precedents

CFJ 1385 "Proposal 4323 contains an Invalid Legislative Order."
[TRUE]   5/31   Called by Goethe
         6/8-9  Assigned to OscarMeyr, who Judges TRUE
         Caller's argument (summary):  This does not create a debt, but merely
           Orders a transfer.  The transfer is prohibited by Rule 1561
           (Illegality of Bonus Clauses), and by clause (a) of Rule 1470 (The
           Bank).

CFJ 1386 "The following provision of Proposal 4329 is without effect: 'all
[TRUE]    outstanding potential debts arising from past transfers are
          deemed, for the purposes of future debts, to have not occurred'"
         6/12     Called by Goddess Eris
         6/12-18  Assigned to Sir Toby, who Judges TRUE
         Caller's argument (summary):  Potential debts come into existence in
           the future, but "deemed to have not occurred" attempts to reverse
           their coming into existence in the past.

CFJ 1387 "Goethe has failed to pay three bonuses of 1 papyrus each to Craig for
[FALSE]   eir passed proposals: 'EPIMENIDES', 'INSANE STEM DISTRIBUTION', and
          'SpLittable Boni'. This is a violation of rule 1678"
         6/17     Called by Craig
         6/17-18  Assigned to Steve, who transfers it to Murphy to be Linked
                    to CFJ 1388
         6/20     Murphy accepts transfer and Judges FALSE
         Judge's refutation (summary):  Rule 1678 requires the Assessor to "pay
           out", not "pay".

CFJ 1388 "Goethe has failed to award three bonuses of one papyrus each to Craig
[TRUE]    ASAP after the passage of eir proposals 'EPIMENIDES', 'INSANE STEM
          DISTRIBUTION', and 'SpLittable Boni'; this violates rule 1479."
         6/17     Called by Craig
         6/17-20  Assigned to Murphy, who Judges TRUE
         6/20     CFJ 1387 becomes Linked to it
         6/20     Murphy Orders a 1-Blot penalty due to Rule 1439

CFJ 1389 "The Bank incurred a debt of 0.1 Papyri to Steve as a result of
[FALSE]   Opposite Proposal 4332."
         6/18     Called by root
         6/19-23  Assigned to Steve, who Judges FALSE
         Caller's argument (summary):  The Rules do not create a debt when a
           Player pays out Property, only when a Player is required to do so.

CFJ 1390 "If Goethe becomes Lawless and is thus deregistered before Eris
[FALSE]   actually blesses the proposal, the proposal will not have the needed
          support to Bless it."
         6/19  Called by Craig
         6/19  Assigned to OscarMeyr, who Judges FALSE
         Judge's refutation (summary):  The Blessing could be supported by
           another Acolyte (e.g. if e did so before seeing Goethe's support).
         Commentary:  "The proposal" is "Quick Papyrus Fix".

CFJ 1391 "Only one valid Notice of Infraction may be announced for a single
[TRUE]    given commission of an Infraction.  Later Notices are either (1)
          invalid or (2) duplicates of the same Notice, without added effect."
         6/19     Called by Goethe
         6/19-25  Assigned to Sir Toby, who Judges TRUE
         6/25-26  Appealed by Steve, root, and harvel
         6/26     Appeal assigned to Murphy, OscarMeyr, and root
         7/1      root moves to SUSTAIN

         7/5  Assigned to root, who Judges FALSE

         7/5  Assigned to Sir Toby
 
CFJ 1396 "Craig submitted 5 CFJs on Friday, July 5."
[TRUE]   7/5  Called by Craig

         7/1  Called by Goethe - Linked to CFJs 1398 and 1399
         Caller's argument (summary):  This tests the application of Rule 594.

          may create a Stem in any Player's possession by its adoption."
         7/1  Called by Goethe - Linked to CFJs 1397 and 1399
