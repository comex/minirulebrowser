Back in September I asked folks to send me three of eir outside
interests.  I said I would compile a list of what we do besides
play Nomic with or fellow Agorans.  [Actually, I said we had a
bunch of math dunderheads around here, and I was curious about
just how many there were.]

The following is the beginning of said list.  I welcome the
inclusion of it into the archives.  It may be that we will wish
to file theses as addendums to any descriptions that are about
to be given.  [Oh, what I would love to do with a WWW set-up,
if I had one...]

* I would prefer statements of interest to rambling discourses, but
  it is your choice.  I have placed these in order of when they were
  received, noted at the end of the record.  This date will change
  when the Player updates the Activities: section.

* This is currently one file, I suppose I will eventually seperate
  it so that it can be assembled in a variety of formats.

* I would love to put the dates of the Agora wins in.

* If you have corrections please send them my way.

Agora wins:  0

Activities:  I'm working full time on a Geology/CSci major, which at my 
             school ends up requiring a Chem minor and a Math minor.  
             Grad school, if it's in the cards (probably) will be in Geology. 

             Depending on what catalog I use, I could be interpreted as 
             already having fulfilled most of a History, a Lit, a Theatre 
             Arts, an Engineering, and a Business minor.  I spent a long 
             time where I could only take one or two classes a session, due 
             to work, and got into the "bad" habit of taking classes because 
             I was interested in them, rather than because I needed them for 
             my piece of paper.  I have taken close to 200 credit hours over
             the last twelve years, intermittantly, with a high 3.9 gpa, and
             am STILL two years away from completing his bachelor's program.
