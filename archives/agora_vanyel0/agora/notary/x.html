<center><h1>X Group Ordinances</h1></center>

<ul type=bullet>
<p><li><font size=+2>ords - The Ordinances</font>
	<ul type=bullet>
	<p><li><i><font size=+1>ords / Interpretation</font>.</i>
  These Ordinances govern the operation of the X Group both internally (within
  the Group) and externally (interactions with Agora). However, these Ordinances
  are purposefully left as incomplete, informal guidelines with respect to
  internal affairs. What is specified is intended as much for outside the
  Group, to inform the Public of the internal policies of the Group, as it
  is for the Group Members themselves. It is intended that common sense,
  honour, a sprit of common purpose and comradeship will allow most decisions
  to be made by mutual consensus. Of course, Ordinances will be added where
  necessary for clarification.

	<p><li><i><font size=+1>ords / Availability</font>.</i>
  The Ordinancekeepor shall keep the Ordinances up-to-date at all times. E
  shall send them without cost to any person who requests them. 

	<p><li><i><font size=+1>ords / Precedence Determination</font>.</i>
  Initially, all Ordinances have equal precedence, and are interpreted in the
  context of all other Ordinances by mutual consensus of the Membership. In
  case of undesirable conflict between Ordinances or Ordinance classes A and B,
  any Member may submit an Internal Proposal to change the Ordinances to
  clarify the precedence. This change may be to add a precedence assertion to A
  or B (I.e., "this Ord takes precedence over..." or "this Ord defers to...")
  or may be to add a new Ordinance which declares a precedence domination of
  one class or Ordinances over another.

	<p><li><i><font size=+1>ords / Ordinance Changes</font>.</i>
  Ordinances are changed by passing an Ordinance Change Internal Proposal. Such
  an Internal Proposal may contain amendments, new Ordinances, repeals, or any
  combination of these. The Proposal is decided by a Group Vote which requires
  a 2/3 majority to pass, as described in the INTERNAL PROPOSALS category.

	</ul>
<p><li><font size=+2>vot - Voting Privileges and Habits</font>
	<ul type=bullet>
	<p><li><i><font size=+1>vot / Classifications</font>.</i>
  Members are classified according to their Voting privileges and habits into
  one of the categories "Active Voting Member" (AVM), "Inactive Voting Member"
  (IVM), and "Non Voting Member" (NVM). The combination of Inactive Voting
  Member and Active Voting Member is known as "Voting Member" (VM). The meaning
  of these classifications is described in the INTERNAL PROPOSALS Category. The
  distinction between AVM and IVM is intended to make Group Votes as fast as
  possible.  The Ordinancekeepor, or a willing delegate, shall keep track of
  the Voting classifications of all Members, and shall provide this information
  when needed.

	<p><li><i><font size=+1>vot / Initial Classification</font>.</i>
  Initially, all Members are classified AVM. A newly admitted Member is
  classified AVM unless NVM was stipulated as a condition for admission.

	<p><li><i><font size=+1>vot / Transition: AVM to IVM</font>.</i>
  A Member's Voting classification changes from AVM to IVM when any of the
  following occur: 1) E fails to Vote on an Internal Proposal during the first
  four days, except those whose Voting periods do not last that long. 2) E goes
  On Hold. 3) E voluntarily changes to IVM.

	<p><li><i><font size=+1>vot / Transition: IVM to AVM</font>.</i>
  A Member's Voting classification changes from IVM to AVM when any of the
  following occur: 1) E casts eir Vote on an Internal Proposal during the
  allotted time. 2) E comes Off Hold. 3) E voluntarily changes to AVM.

	<p><li><i><font size=+1>vot / Transition: To and From NVM</font>.</i>
  An Internal Proposal is required to change a Member's classification between
  NVM and another classification. This requires 2/3 majority to pass.

	</ul>
<p><li><font size=+2>iprop - Internal Proposals</font>
	<ul type=bullet>
	<p><li><i><font size=+1>iprop / Definition</font>.</i>
  An Internal Proposal is a Proposal-like entity which is submitted to the X
  Group for consideration and Voted on by X Members. If an Internal Proposal
  passes, it generally has some effect on some entity of relevance to the
  Group. Examples of classes of Internal Proposals are the following. This list
  is automatically amended when new types of Internal Proposals are created.
		<ul type=bullet>
		<li>Internal Proposal to change the Ordinances
		<li>Internal Proposal to change a Member's Voting Classification
		<li>Internal Proposal to admit a Member to the Group
		<li>Internal Proposal to expel a Member from the Group
		<li>Internal Proposal to replace the Vizier or Ordinancekeepor
		<li>Internal Proposal to endorse a statement as Official
		<li>Internal Proposal to modify the Archive of Official Statements
		<li>Internal Proposal to endorse a Collaborative Proposal as Official
		<li>Internal Proposal to expend Group Points or Currencies
		<li>Internal Proposal to create or destroy Group Coins
		</ul>

	<p><li><i><font size=+1>iprop / Distribution</font>.</i>
  An Internal Proposal is considered distributed at the time that it is sent
  to all Voting Members, to the best knowledge of the sender.

	<p><li><i><font size=+1>iprop / Voting Period</font>.</i>
  The Voting Period is one Week from the time the Internal Proposal is
  placed Up For Vote, or as soon as the passage or failure of the Proposal is
  known with certainty, whichever is sooner. At the end of this period, the
  Member who submitted the Proposal shall tally the Votes and report the
  passage or failure of the Proposal. Unless otherwise specified, an Internal
  Proposal passes if at least 2/3 of all Votes cast are FOR.

	<p><li><i><font size=+1>iprop / Casting the Vote</font>.</i>
  A Voting Member casts eir Vote by informing the Member who submitted the
  Proposal.  Legal Votes are FOR, AGAINST, and ABSTAIN. Public Votes (i.e., to
  all Group Members) are encouraged but not required. A Non Voting Member may
  not Vote on Internal Proposals.

	<p><li><i><font size=+1>iprop / Defaults for Active Voting Members</font>.</i>
  It is anticipated that an Active Voting Member will Vote on an Internal
  Proposal. This is taken into account in deciding if a Voting Period can be
  ended early because the result is certain. However, if an Active Voting
  Member does not Vote during the Voting Period for an Internal Proposal, this
  is treated as ABSTAIN, and the AVM will be reclassified as IVM.

	<p><li><i><font size=+1>iprop / Defaults for Inactive Voting Members</font>.</i>
  It is anticipated that an Inactive Voting Member will not Vote on an Internal
  Proposal. This is taken into account in deciding if a Voting period can be
  ended early because the result is certain. However, if an Inactive Voting
  Member does Vote during the Voting Period for an Internal Proposal, this Vote
  shall be counted, and the IVM will be reclassified as AVM.

	<p><li><i><font size=+1>iprop / For Consideration/Up for Vote</font>.</i>
  Any Voting Member, herein called the Proposer, may distribute an Internal
  Proposal labeled as "For Consideration".  The Proposer may make any
  changes at any thime that e sees fit, but it is suggested e does not
  radically change the Internal Proposal.
  <p>
  If an Internal Proposal For Consideration has been Endorsed by 3 of 1/3
  (whichever is greater) of the Voting Members, it is then placed "Up for
  Vote".  An Internal Proposal is considered "Up for Vote" when the
  proposer distributes a message containing the Internal Proposal, a list
  of endorsements, and states that it has been placed "Up for Vote".  The
  Proposer may not make any changes to the Internal Proposal once it is
  "Up for Vote".
  <p>
  Each Proposer is required to keep track of eir Internal Proposals, both
  "For Consideration" and "Up for Vote", as well as all Endorsements for
  them.

	</ul>
<p><li><font size=+2>mem - Membership</font>
	<ul type=bullet>
	<p><li><i><font size=+1>mem / Roster</font>.</i>
  Current Membership is as follows. This Ord is automatically amended as
  necessary to reflect the actual Membership. The ordering of this list may not
  be arbitrarily changed. When automatically amended to add the name of a new
  Member, the name is added to the bottom of the list.
		<ul type=bullet>
		<li>Dave B
		<li>KoJen
		<li>Michael
		<li>Andre
		<li>Ian
		</ul>

	<p><li><i><font size=+1>mem / Admission</font>.</i>
  To accept a new Member, an Internal Proposal to accept the new Member must
  pass. A 2/3 majority Vote of current Members is required.

	<p><li><i><font size=+1>mem / Expulsion</font>.</i>
  To expel a Member, an Internal Proposal to expel the Member must pass. A 2/3
  majority Vote of current Members, with the exception of the Member considered
  for expulsion, is required. In addition, a Member may voluntarily remove
  emself from Membership, as indicated by a message to the Vizier.

	</ul>
<p><li><font size=+2>vizord - The Vizier and Ordinancekeepor</font>
	<ul type=bullet>
	<p><li><i><font size=+1>vizord / Name of Vizier</font>.</i>
  The Vizier is Michael. This Ord is automatically amended as necessary to
  indicate the actual Vizier.

	<p><li><i><font size=+1>vizord / Name of Ordinancekeepor</font>.</i>
  The Ordinancekeepor is Dave B. This Ord is automatically amended as necessary
  to indicate the actual Ordinancekeepor.

	<p><li><i><font size=+1>vizord / Replacement By Proposal</font>.</i>
  The Vizier automatically changes when the Ordinance which names the Vizier is
  amended by Internal Proposal to name a different Member. 
  <p>
  The Ordinancekeepor automatically changes when the Ordinance which names the
  Ordinancekeepor is amended by Internal Proposal to name a different Member.

	<p><li><i><font size=+1>vizord / Replacement By Resignation</font>.</i>
  A Vizier may resign, providing that e first appoints another Voting
  Member willing to perform the duties of this position. The position is
  immediately transferred to the willing appointed Member. 
  <p>
  An Ordinancekeepor may resign, providing that e first appoints another Voting
  Member willing to perform the duties of this position. The position is
  immediately transferred to the willing appointed Member.

	<p><li><i><font size=+1>vizord / Replacement By Default</font>.</i>
  At any time when the Viziership would be about to become Vacant because no
  other method of replacement is applicable, Viziership is automatically
  transferred to the next Voting Member in the Group who is not On Hold, in
  the order listed in the Membership Roster Ordinance, exluding any Member who
  does not desire the position as determined by asking em.
  <p>
  At any time when the Ordinancekeepor position would be about to become Vacant
  because no other method of replacement is applicable, the position is
  automatically transferred to the next Voting Member in the Group who is not
  On Hold, in the order listed in the Membership Roster Ordinance, exluding any
  Member who does not desire the position as determined by asking em.

	</ul>
<p><li><font size=+2>ostat - Official Group Statements</font>
	<ul type=bullet>
	<p><li><i><font size=+1>ostat / Definition</font>.</i>
  An Official X Group Statement is a text which has been endorsed by the Group
  as representing the official position of the Group. This endorsement is
  conferred when a Member submits an Internal Proposal to endorse the text as
  an Official X Group Statement, and it receives the necessary 2/3 majority.

	<p><li><i><font size=+1>ostat / Publication</font>.</i>
  Any Member may distribute an Official Statement outside the group by
  attaching a note which clearly identifies the Statement as an Official
  Statement of the X Group. This notation may not be used unless the statement
  is in fact an Official Statement.

	<p><li><i><font size=+1>ostat / Official Archives</font>.</i>
  The Ordinancekeepor shall maintain an archive of Offical Group
  Statements. These archives represent Official longstanding policies of the X
  Group. These archives shall be distributed to any person who requests
  them. Not all Official Group Statements are recorded in the archives, as some
  statements are of transitory relevance. Statements are added to or removed
  from the archives by Internal Proposal; a 2/3 majority is required. If an
  archived Statement states an "expiration date" or "expiration condition", it
  is removed from the Archives when the stated date or condition occurs.
 
	</ul>
<p><li><font size=+2>oprop - Official Group Proposals</font>
	<ul type=bullet>
	<p><li><i><font size=+1>oprop / Definition</font>.</i>
  An Official Group Proposal is a text intended to become an Agora Proposal
  which has been prepared by a collaboration of Group Members and endorsed as
  an Official Group Proposal by Internal Group Proposal; a 2/3 majority is
  required. Such endorsement should be conferred only after thorough internal
  debate and analysis, in an effort to eliminate as many flaws and loopholes
  before submitting it to the wider audience of Agorans.

	<p><li><i><font size=+1>oprop / Distribution</font>.</i>
  When the Group has endorsed a Proposal as Official, one Member is chosen to
  represent the Group for this Proposal. This Member shall submit the Proposal
  for proto-Proposing, and, when the Group decides it is ready, shall submit it
  for Vote. At all times, attached commentary must indicate that this is an
  Official X Group Proposal.

	<p><li><i><font size=+1>oprop / Rewards and Penalties</font>.</i>
  All Voting Members are expected to share equally in any rewards or penalties
  resulting from the submission and voting on an Official Group Proposal.
  Voting Members are expected to make voluntary trades of Points and other
  Currencies, to the extent permitted, in order to share as equally as possible
  in the rewards and penalties. Because these trades may not always be
  possible, such sharing of rewards and penalties may also be achieved by
  frequently varying the Member chosen to represent the Group in Official
  Proposals.

	<p><li><i><font size=+1>oprop / Voting Obligations</font>.</i>
  All Members who are able to Vote on Agora Proposals are encouraged to support
  all Official Group Proposals by Voting FOR. They may not Vote AGAINST. If
  they do not Vote FOR, they do not share in any rewards resulting from the
  Proposal, if any. However, they are still liable for penalties resulting from
  the Proposal, if any.

	</ul>
<p><li><font size=+2>treas - The Treasury</font>
	<ul type=bullet>
	<p><li><i><font size=+1>treas / Recordkeepor</font>.</i>
  The Vizier is responsible for keeping track of the contents of the Group
  treasury, and also the number and location of any Group Coins in existence.

	<p><li><i><font size=+1>treas / Treasury Statement Availability</font>.</i>
  A statement of the contents of the Group Treasury shall be given to any
  person who requests it, without cost.

	<p><li><i><font size=+1>treas / Coins Report Availability</font>.</i>
  A Group Coins statement shall be provided without cost to any person who
  requests it subject to these limitations:
  <p>
  Any person not a Member of the Group is entitled only to a report of the
  number of Group Coins e (or an entity managed by em) possesses, and to a
  report of the total number of Group Coins in existence. A person not a Member
  of the Group shall not be given a report listing the number of Group Coins
  which another person (or an entity not managed by em) possesses.  However,
  secrecy cannot be guaranteed.
  <p>
  Because it is required for planning purposes, all Group Members are entitled
  to the entire Group Coins Statement at all times.

	<p><li><i><font size=+1>treas / Use of Group Treasury</font>.</i>
  Points and Currencies from the Group treasury may be used only as specified
  by the Ordinances, or when an Internal Proposal mandating the expenditure of
  such Points and Currencies passes. A 2/3 majority Vote is required. The
  expenditure of such Points and Currencies is concurrent with the message from
  the Vizier, as required by Agoran Rules.

	<p><li><i><font size=+1>treas / Creation and Destruction of Coins</font>.</i>
  Coins may be created and destroyed only as specified by the Ordinances, or
  when an Internal Proposal mandating such creation or destruction passes. A
  2/3 majority Vote is required.

	<p><li><i><font size=+1>treas / Personal Use</font>.</i>
  Members may store their own Points or Currencies in the Group Treasury. The
  Vizier shall keep track of such contributions, and shall return such Points
  and Currencies to their previous owner when requested by em, to the extent
  that this is allowed by Agora Rules and the condition of the Treasury. This
  is provided as a service to X Group Members, with the understanding that the
  safety of such Points and Currencies cannot be guaranteed, although
  reasonable efforts will be made.

	<p><li><i><font size=+1>treas / Disbursements for Leaving Player</font>.</i>
  A Player is expected to settle eir account with the Group Treasury prior to
  leaving the Group. If e leaves without doing so, disbursements from the
  Treasury to the Player are at the discretion of the remaining Members. If
  necessary, an Internal Proposal may be submitted and passed to determine the
  ex-Player's share.

	<p><li><i><font size=+1>treas / Division As Equally As Possible</font>.</i>
Whenever an Ordinance or agreement among Group Members requires that an Entity
be divided as equally as possible among the X Group Members, and it is not
possible to divide the Entity into precisely equal portions, then the following
procedure shall be used:
		<ol>
		<li>Each Member is given the largest portion of the Entity such that each Member
		receives an exactly equal portion.

		<li>The remaining amount is given to a Member chosen randomly by the Vizier. 
		</ol>
	</ul>
<p><li><font size=+2>gvote - Group Voting</font>
	<ul type=bullet>
	<p><li><i><font size=+1>gvote / Procedure</font>.</i>
Whenever an Agora Proposal is Distributed, all Group Members may (if they wish)
indicate their preference for the Group Vote on the Proposal, by a public
message to the Group. All of the following are valid choices:
		<ul type=bullet>
		<li>FOR: I wish the Group to Vote FOR.

		<li>AGAINST: I wish the Group to Vote AGAINST.

		<li>ABSTAIN: I wish the Group to ABSTAIN.

		<li>NONE: I do not wish the Group to Vote.
		</ul>
After five days the Vizier shall tabulate all preferences received. E shall
then cast a Group Vote as follows:
		<ul type=bullet>
		<li>If at least 1/3 of the preferences are NONE, the Group Vote shall not be
		cast. 

		<li>Otherwise, if the count of one of the preferences FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN
		is at least 2/3 of the total count of all the preferences FOR, AGAINST, or
		ABSTAIN, then the Group Vote shall be cast according to this majority
		preference. 
		</ul>
	<p><li><i><font size=+1>gvote / Implicit Preference Declaration</font>.</i>
A Member may declare Implicit Group Voting preferences, by a public statement
to the Group, as long as the statement is unambiguous in the opinion of the
Vizier. The Vizier is responsible for recording these implicit preferences, and
shall use these when applicable as the Member's actual preference on a
Proposal, unless the Member explicitely declares eir preference on a particular
Proposal. An Implicit Preference Declaration remains in effect unless revoked
by the Member who made it.
<p>
The following are some hypothetical examples of Implicit Preference Declaration
Statements which would normally be considered unambiguous. This is not
necessarily an exhaustive list. Final desision on ambiguity rests with the
Vizier. 
		<ul type=bullet>
		<li>My Group Voting preference for all Proposals is NONE.

		<li>I wish the Group to Vote FOR all Proposals endorsed by the Group.

		<li>I wish the Group to Vote AGAINST all Proposals by KoJen.

		<li>I wish the Group to Vote AGAINST all Proposals whose effect includes the
		repeal of the Mark.  
		</ul>

	<p><li><i><font size=+1>gvote / Extra Votes</font>.</i>
When a Member indicates eir Group Voting Preference on a Proposal, either
explicitely or implicitely, e may additionally specify a positive number of
Votes to be used for the Group Vote on the Proposal. If a Member does not
specify the number of Votes, it is considered to be 1. If the number of Votes
is higher than is permitted, it is considered to be the maximum permitted.
<p>
When the Vizier sends a Group Vote of FOR or AGAINST on a Proposal, e shall
indicate not only the Vote (FOR or AGAINST), but also the number of Votes to be
used, including Extra Votes from the Group Treasury. This number is the average
of the valid numbers specified by Members in their Voting Preference
Declarations, rounded to the nearest integer.
