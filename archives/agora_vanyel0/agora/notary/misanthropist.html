<center><h1>Misanthropists' Group Ordinances</h1></center>

<ol>
<li>These Group Ordinances may be changed only by unanimous agreement of
   all Group Members.  When all Members have agreed to a change, the
   Vizier shall distribute the new Ordinances to all Members.  Under
   no circumstances shall these Ordinances be interpreted as
   constraining the casting of personal Votes by Members.
<p>
<li>The initial Vizier for the Group is favor.  The Vizier may resign
   at any time, transferring the Viziership to a willing Group Member
   by whatever procedure is mandated by the Rules of Agora Nomic.
   It is the responsibility of the Vizier to detect and report any
   currency transfers mandated by these Ordinances.
<p>
<li>There are two positions, known as Misanthropists' Group Voter and
   Misanthropists' Group Roller.  The Roller is normally the Vizier,
   although e may delegate this position to any willing Member.  The
   Voter is selected as described below.
<p>
<li>At any time that the Group has fewer than four (4) members,
   any Player of Agora Nomic may become a Member of the Group by
   informing the Vizier that e does so, and by taking any other
   actions that are required by the Rules of Agora Nomic.  No
   membership fee is required.
<p>
<li>When a Player becomes a member of the Group for the first time, e
   is issued three (3) Group Coins from the Group Treasury.  With luck,
   these will become Valuable Collector's Items.  If any currencies
   except Extra Votes somehow find themselves in the Group Teasury,
   they will remain there until the Members of the Group unanimously
   agree to do something else with them.
<p>
<li>Each Nomic Week, the Roller will randomly select one of the Active
   Players who is a Member of the Group to be Group Voter for the next
   week.  The Roller will announce the selection to all Group Members.
   There will be no Group Voter for the week that the Group first comes
   into being.
<p>
<li>The Group Voter for a given Week has the full and sole authority
   to vote on behalf of the Group on any Proposals which are distributed
   by the Promotor during that Week.  e may also at eir discretion cast
   one (and no more than one) of the Extra Votes (if any) in the Group
   Treasury on one of those Proposals; eir notifying the Vizier of eir
   desire to do so causes one of the Extra Votes in the Group Treasury
   to be transferred to the Treasury of the Group Voter.  The Group Voter
   shall inform the Vizier of how the Group will vote, and the Vizier
   shall forward this information to the Agora Assessor (or other
   mechanisms for Group Voting, should any be adopted by Agora Nomic).
