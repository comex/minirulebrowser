PROPOSAL 2429 (favor)
Require smooth Officer transitions

  Let there be a Rule entitled "Officer Transition", with
  the following text:

    Whenever a Player ceases to hold an Office, that
    Player shall make a reasonable effort to ensure that
    all materials necessary for the conduct of that Office,
    including any records the holder of that Office is
    required to maintain, are made available to the
    next Player to hold that Office.  A Player who
    fails to do so violates this Rule, and commits
    a Class C Crime.

(Impose a moral obligation, at least, not to intentionally
obstruct a smooth Officer transition.)
