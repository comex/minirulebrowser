Protosal
#pragma Plato's Revenge

The following Rule shall be created:
      The Rules in the Agora Ruleset are also known as the Agoran Laws
      of Nature.  Collectively they define the realm of possible actions
      within the Game of Agora.  Nothing which is not explicitly or
      implicitly allowed by the Laws of Nature can possibly occur within
      the Game of Agora.

The following Rule shall be created:
      There exists a Subordinate Legal Code known as the Agora Code of
      Laws.  This Code applies to all Players, and it is possible but
      not permissible to violate any of the rules in the Code.
      Penalties for violation may be assessed by the Code.

The following Rule shall be created:
      For each of the numbers in the following list, the Rule with that
      number shall be Repealed, and a rule with identical text to the
      Repealed Rule shall be created within the Agora Code.

      {list of pragmatic rules}
(end)

Note, of course, that this Protosal doesn't even begin to cover all the
necessary legal ground for a switch of these proportions; for instance,
how will the SLC be numbered, what additional Rules or SLC rules will
need to be created to handle the system, etc., etc.  But it's an idea.

General Notes:
Some of the Officers Rules need splitting up... there should be a rule
defining the Office in the Pl set, and a rule defining duties of the
Office in the Pr set.

Much of the Pr set is made up of two large classes of rules--Rules which
define Crimes, and Rules which define ASAP actions.  There are a few
exceptions.

A *whole lot* of otherwise-Platonic Rules require Reporting of some
transfer... I've put these in the Pl set, although they should probably
be fixed up a bit.

In general, I think, most of the fundamental rule-change rules should be
Pl, although some of the exact mechanics will be Pr.

Obviously, rules which require a Player to do something are Pr.  But
what about Rules which denote a bonus for a Player?  I think they're Pl,
but I'm not sure.

Re: the "legal" debate--a _lot_ of the Pl rules use the word 'legal'.

Note: I'm skipping the entire Courts section of the Ruleset, because my
copy of the Ruleset is pre-Court reform.  Has Chuck published another
one?
