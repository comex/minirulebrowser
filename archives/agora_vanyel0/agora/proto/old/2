Subject: Oops !! Admission of Guilt

Whoops!  I missed Rule 815 which specifies to send stuff directly to officers.
I'll take care of that momentarily... However, since I'm not officially 
registered yet, does that count against me?  Anyway, "Vanyel" is a character
in a series of novels.

Also, I would like to Proto:

PROTO-PROPOSAL DB2 (Vanyel)
(Creates a rule)
Combination of Related Rules

  When more than four rules exist which are related to the same topic, any 
Player may put forth a Non-Rule-Change Proposal requesting these rules to
be Combined.  This proposal must be voted on, and will have an Adoption Index
of 1.  If that Proposal is passed, the Player who first Proposed to Combine
the Rules will be appointed to the temporary position of Combiner of Rules
X, Y, ..., Z (where "X, Y, ..., Z" is the list of rules to be combined).  This
position will have a one-time salary of five Points.  The new Combiner of Rules
X, Y, ..., Z shall then proceed as soon as possible to combine all the Rules
he is charged to combine.  In the resulting Proposal, all conceivable 
situations should be resolvable exactly as they would were Rules X, Y, ..., Z
still in effect.  The Type of this Proposal shall be (Combines Rules).  Once
completed, this Proposal will be sent to the Speaker as with standard Rule-
Change Proposals.  This Proposal shall have an Adoption Index of 3.  If
passed, the resulting rule will be Mutable, unless the Mutation laws have
been passed, in which case it will have a Mutation Index of 1.

  Since there is no actual change made to the Adjudication of Rules, this
would be a Legal Rule and is *not* in conflict with any of 109, 110, 111,
or 115.  This rule supersedes all other rules regarding Combination of 
Rules.
**End of Proto-proposal**

PROPOSAL
(Creates a rule)
Combination of Related Rules

  When more than four rules exist which are related to the same topic, any 
Player may put forth a Non-Rule-Change Proposal requesting these rules to
be Combined.  This proposal must be voted on, and will have an Adoption Index
of 1.  If that Proposal is passed, the Player who first Proposed to Combine
the Rules will be appointed to the temporary position of Combiner of Rules
X, Y, ..., Z (where "X, Y, ..., Z" is the list of rules to be combined).  This
position will have a one-time salary of five Points.  The new Combiner of Rules
X, Y, ..., Z shall then proceed as soon as possible to combine all the Rules
he is charged to combine.  In the resulting Proposal, all conceivable 
situations should be resolvable exactly as they would were Rules X, Y, ..., Z
still in effect.  The Type of this Proposal shall be (Combines Rules).  Once
completed, this Rule-Combining Proposal will be sent to the Speaker as with 
Rule-Change Proposals. 

  Once passed, this Rule will take on the Mutability (i.e. Mutable, Immutable,
or Semi-Mutable) of its least Mutable component.  As this is not a Rule
Change, this does not conflict with rule 105.  If all of Rules X, Y, ..., Z
are Mutable (or have a Mutability Index of 1) then the resulting Rule will
be Mutable, and requires an Adoption Index of 1.  If one or more of Rules X,
Y, ..., Z is Immutable (or has a Mutability Index of Unanimous), the resulting 
Combined Rule will be Immutable, but requires a Unanimous vote to pass.  If
none of Rules X, Y, ..., Z is Immutable, then the highest Mutability Index
among them shall be the Mutability Index of the resulting Combined Rule.

  Since there is no actual change made to the Adjudication of Rules or lowering
of the Mutability (Mutable/Immutable) of any, this is be a Legal Rule and is 
*not* in conflict with any of 105, 109, 110, 111, or 115.  This rule 
supersedes all other rules regarding Combination, Mutation, or Amendment of 
Rules.
**End of proposal**

May I call to the Speaker's attention the fact that this proposal was proto-
proposed as PROTO-Proposal DB2, and that the Proposal has Evolved from that
initial state.
