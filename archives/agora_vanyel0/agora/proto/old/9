PROTO-Proposal DB9  (Vanyel)
Randomness
(Creates a rule)

All occurrences of the word "random" or forms of it shall be taken to
mean "any of the choices with equally distributed possibility for
each".

***End Proto

That should take care of a few ambiguities.

Don> That should take care of a few ambiguities.

and create a few: "any" can mean more than one.

how about:

      Whenever the Rules call for a "random" selection of a member
      from a set, the selection shall be made by uniquely indexing
      each member of the set, selecting a uniformly distributed
      discrete random value whose range is set of indices thus
      assigned, and then selecting the member of the set corresponding
      to the selected index.

Oh, fine.  I'll change it to 'a', then.

Oh, come on!  I understand that, but its a little complex.  I think
it's sufficient to say that each Player must have an equal chance;
I'll leave the exact method to the CotC, or whoever.  Besides, how
can this be enforced?  For all practical purposes, saying 'equal 
chance' is about as picky as we can get...

Please note that I am not yet Speaker.  I appreciate that you want
to lessen Timothy's work, but a proposal sent to a non-Speaker
is irrelevant.  The simplest way is to send it to Timothy and cc:
it to me.  That way I will know it has been sent to the Speaker.

Chuck

P.S. Please read Rule 928 for the requirements you must meet in
order to receive the proto-proposal bonus.
