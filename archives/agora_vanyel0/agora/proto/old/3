In light of various comments, I have revised Proto DB1 as follows:

Proto-PROPOSAL DB3 (Vanyel)
(Creates a Rule)
Speaker Must Post Voting Reminder

    No less than 72 hours and no more than 96 hours before the end of a
voting period, the Speaker must post a reminder of the vote, in the form

Proposal 9999 (name-of-the-rule) is currently under vote;  all votes must
be in by Sun, Aug 32, 1999 at 13:70. (87 hours from now)  This proposal
reads as follows:
   Proposal Text.

The Speaker is given some latitude in the exact form of his announcement,
as long as the announcement includes the proposal name, number, and text,
and the date and time it is due.  Violation of this Rule is a Class A
crime.

It is recommended but not required that the Speaker make a similar 
announcement approximately a day before the close of voting.

***End Of Proto


Vanyel

PS Can anyone cc to me a copy of proto DB2 (combining rules)?  I seem to 
have deleted mine.

the hypertext rule set is no longer there;
I stopped maintaining it when proposal results started coming out withyout including the text of the passed proposals.

May put it back at some time.  Don't hjold your breath, though

This is still only a one-day window.  What if the Speaker doesn't have
mail access on the weekend, or is out of town for the weekend?

Leave out the form.  Let the Speaker format it however he wants, as
long as it contains all the necessary information.  (Which you
pretty much do in the next paragraph anyway, so why the format?)

Or even "the date and time of the end of the voting period"

I see a problem here: you leave open a 24 hour window to send out this
reminder. What if this window fals in a weekend?

You are curing the weekend problem for the Voters and you introduce it
for the Speaker.

Aprat from that, I am opposed to this idea. I think a Real Agorian doesn't
need such a reminder.

What????? A second reminder? You are really spoiling us.

What about this:

The Speaker will send out a reminder about 24 hours before closing
of the voting period (likely to fall *outside* a weekend), if quorum
has not yet been reached at the time.

I still would vote AGAINST though, as I am a Real Agorian.

Stella?
