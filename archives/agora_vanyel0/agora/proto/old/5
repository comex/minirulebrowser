Hm.  How about this...

PROTO-Proposal DB5
(Amends a Rule)
New Rules Only

 Amend Rule 399 to read as follows:

Let there be an Officer known as the Rulekeepor.  The Rulekeepor must mantain
a complete list of the Current Rules, and distribute it on request.  In
addition, e must post all changes to the Ruleset as soon as possible after
they occur; in other words, e must post all New Rules, Amendments to Rules,
Transmutations and Mutations of Rules, and Removal of Rules as they are
passed.

While the Rulekeepor is in Office, the Speaker is under no obligation to
maintain or distribute the Rules.

(*Was: 399*)
