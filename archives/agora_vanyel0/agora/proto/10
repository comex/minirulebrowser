Now, I will preface this by saying that this is an idea which just happened
to occur to me;  it probably isn't too well thought out, and I don't even
know what people will say about it.  It does, however, provide another
use for Marks.

PROTO-Proposal DB10 (Vanyel)
Suing Players
(Creates a rule)

It is possible for any Player to sue any other Player.  In order to sue,
all of the following conditions must be met:

	1) The Player who wishes to sue must pay to the Bank a "service
	   charge" of 2 Marks. 
	2) The Suing Player must send a message to the Clerk of the 
	   Courts stating that e wishes to sue.  E must state who
	   he wishes to sue, and for what reason.
	3) The Clerk of the Courts must verify that the service charge
	   has been paid, then e must assign a judge randomly from the
	   list of all Active Players.  The Clerk shall then post a
	   Notice which states the offence, who is suing, and who is
	   judging.

The matter over which a Player sues must not be illegal; if so, it should
be taken care of through CFJ.  It must be a matter which has caused great
personal wrong (as determined by eim).

The Judge of such a case must review it and come to a decision.  If e
wishes, e may poll the Public Forum for ideas, but ultimately e must 
make a decision within a week of the original Notice.  If the Judge
decides in favor of the Plaintiff, then the Defendant must pay the
Bank the 2Mk service charge, which shall subsequently be refunded to
the Plaintiff.  In addition, the Judge must decide on a Settlement,
in Marks or points, which e believes is sufficient to address the 
grievance.  Under no circumstances may the Settlement be of a greater
amount than the original loss (if any) of the Plaintiff.

The Decision and Settlement shall be posted to the Public Forum.  The
Defendant, if found Guilty, is obligated to pay the Settlement to the
Plaintiff, as well as the service charge.  If the Defendant is found
Innocent, then there is no change to the Game State as a result of this
hearing.

The Judgement may be appealed through a CFJ.

***END PROTO

This would give a recourse for a particularly nasty scam, I'd say.  I
dunno... what do you think?

 Here's the Civil Courts Proto you asked for. 


 PROTO-Proposal DB10 (Vanyel)
 Civil Courts
 (Creates a rule)
 
 It is possible for any Player to sue any other Player in the Civil Court.
 In order to sue, all of the following conditions must be met:
 
 	1) The Player who wishes to sue must pay to the Bank a "service
 	   charge" of .5 Marks.   [This prevents frivolous Suing.]
 	2) The Suing Player must send a message to the Clerk of the 
 	   Courts stating that e wishes to sue.  E must state the Name
	   of a Player or other Nomic Entity whom he wishes to sue, and
	   for what reason.   [For bureaucratical purposes.]
 	3) The Clerk of the Courts must verify that the service charge
 	   has been paid, then e must assign a judge randomly from the
 	   list of all Active Players.  The Clerk shall then post a
 	   Notice which states the offence, who is suing, and who is
 	   judging.  
 
 The matter over which a Player sues must not specifically break any Rule
 other than those regarding personal agreements and "Oaths".  If it does,
 in fact, break one of these other Rules, then it must be taken care of
 through CFJ.  It must be a matter which has caused great personal wrong
 (as determined by eim) and which breaks a specific agreement made between
 the Plaintiff (the Player suing) and the Defendant (the Player or other
 Entity being sued).   [This prevents dual jurisdiction of Civil and CFJ
 Court...]
 
 The Judge of such a case must review it and come to a decision.  If e
 wishes, e may poll the Public Forum for ideas, but ultimately e must 
 make a decision within a week of the original Notice.  Said decision
 must be "PLAINTIFF" or "DEFENDANT".  If the Judge decides in favor of
 the Plaintiff, then the Defendant must pay the Bank the service charge,
 which shall subsequently be refunded to the Plaintiff.  In addition, the
 Judge must decide on a Settlement, in Marks or points, which e believes
 is sufficient to address the grievance.  Under no circumstances may the
 Settlement be of a greater amount than the original loss (if any) of the
 Plaintiff.  [To recompense for a realistic Civil Court case.]
 
 The Decision and Settlement shall be posted to the Public Forum.  The
 Defendant, if found Guilty, is obligated to pay the Settlement to the
 Plaintiff, as well as the service charge.  If the Defendant is found
 Innocent, then there is no change to the Game State as a result of this
 hearing.

 In the case of Suing over an Oath, the Civil Court Case takes precedence.
 The Oath may be considered to be fulfilled following the conclusion of the
 case and the carrying out of the Settlement.  [This prevents a conflict
 with the CFJ courts... Once someone brings an Oath disagreement to the
 Civil Court, it cannot be also taken to a CFJ.]
 
 The Decision may be appealed through a CFJ.

 It is recommended that the Civil Court be used primarily to resolve
 arguments over Corporations, Stocks and Dividends, Oaths, and similar
 disputes over agreements.  Later additions to the Ruleset may provide
 other reasons to use the Civil Courts; this Rule yields to their
 greater Wisdom.

perhaps it would be best to make civil court the legal form of
restitution for breach of oath (i.e. amend rule 1060 to allow a civil
court, and not a CFJ, to be used to determine if an Oath has been
broken).

Don> The Judge of such a case must review it and come to a decision.  If e

leave out the "poll the Public Forum".  of course e can do so.  i
would instead stipulate that the Judge of a civil proceeding is
obligated to rule in the same manner as the Judge of a CFJ is required
to rule as per Rule 217.

Don> Said decision must be "PLAINTIFF" or "DEFENDANT".  If the Judge

a Judge who finds for the Plaintiff should be able to grant
compensatory damages as demanded by the Plaintiff in eir Complaint, 
and in addition should be able to grant punitive damages as permitted
by the Rules.
 
Don> The Decision and Settlement shall be posted to the Public Forum.  The

the terms "Guilty" and "Innocent" are not used in civil court.  the
comparable terms are "liable" and "not liable".

 Here's the Revised Super-Duper Civil Courts Proto.


 PROTO-Proposal DB10 (Vanyel)
 Civil Courts
 (Creates a rule)
 
 It is possible for any Player(s) to sue any other Player(s) or Entity(s) in
 the Civil Court.  In order to sue, all of the following conditions must be
 met:
 
 	1) The Player(s) who wishes to sue must pay to the Bank a "service
 	   charge" of .5 Marks.   [This prevents frivolous Suing.]
 	2) The Suing Player must send a message to the Clerk of the 
 	   Courts stating that e wishes to sue.  E must state the Name
	   of a Player or other Nomic Entity whom he wishes to sue, and
	   for what reason.  If multiple Players wish to Sue, one of 
	   them must be selected to submit the Suit, and must include
	   the names of all other Player involved.  Each of these Players
	   must send a message to the CotC confirming their pariticipation.
	   They may split the service charge any way they wish.  If they
	   wish to bring multiple Entities to Suit, all such Entities must
	   be explicitly mentioned in the Suit.
	3) Each Player who is Suing may be known as "Defendant", and the set
	   of all Defendants for a given Suit may be known as "Defendant".
	   Each Entity being Sued shall be known as "Plaintiff", and the set
	   of all Plaintiffs for a given Suit may be known as "Plaintiff".
	   [This allows this Rule and all subsequent to refer only in the
	   singular.]
 	4) The Clerk of the Courts must verify that the service charge
 	   has been paid, then e must assign a judge randomly from the
 	   list of all Active Players excluding the Plaintiff and Defendant.
	   The Clerk shall then post a Notice to the Public Forum which
	   states the offence, who is suing, and who is judging.  The 
	   Notice must include "CCC #X", where X is the number of the Suit.
	   Suits shall be numbered sequentially beginning with 1.
	   [CCC == Civil Court Case, btw]

 Upon the announcement of the Suit, the Plaintiff may submit a complete
 argument to the Public Forum describing why the Defendant is in error.
 Likewise the Defendant may submit an argument to the Public Forum in
 eir own defence.  Either Plaintiff or Defendant may waive eir right to
 these submissions, but if they will submit such an argument they must
 do so within 72 Hours of the announcement of the Suit.
 
 The matter over which a Plaintiff sues must not specifically break any Rule.
 If it does, in fact, break one of these other Rules, then it must be taken
 care of through CFJ.  It must be a matter which has caused great personal
 wrong (as determined by the Plaintiff) and which breaks a specific agreement
 made between the Plaintiff and the Defendant.
 
 The Judge of such a case must review it and come to a decision.  If e
 wishes, e may receive outside input on eir decision, but e must
 make a decision within a week of the original Notice.  Said decision
 must be "PLAINTIFF" or "DEFENDANT".  If the Judge decides in favor of
 the Plaintiff, then the Defendant must pay the Bank the service charge,
 which shall subsequently be refunded to the Plaintiff.  The Decision
 shall be posted to the Public Forum.

 In the event that the Decision is "PLAINTIFF", the Plaintiff, Defendant,
 and any Agora Nomic Player may submit suggested Settlements and Penalties.
 Both the Settlement and the Penalty shall be deducted from the accounts of
 the Defendant (in the case of a multiple-Entity Defendant, the Entities
 may divide payment of Settlement and Penalty in any way between them).  The
 Settlement shall be payed to the Plaintiff as recompense for damages, and 
 the Penalty shall revert to Agora (the Bank for Marks, the Point Reserve
 for Points).  The Judge must select a Settlement and Penalty from among
 the submissions within 72 hours of eir Decision.  If no submissions have
 been made by that time the Judge is permitted to create eir own Penalty
 and Settlement. (Note that Settlements and Penalties of zero or negative
 amounts are permissible.)

 The Settlement shall be posted to the Public Forum.  If the Judgement is
 PLAINTIFF, the Defendant is obligated to pay any Settlements or Penalties
 to the appropriate parties, as well as reimburse the Plaintiff for the
 Service Charge.  If the Judgement is DEFENDANT, there is no such Penalty
 or Settlement.

 When dealing with Oaths, the Civil Court Case takes precedence.  Upon
 judgement over whether the Oath was broken, and following the carrying
 out of Settlements and Penalties, the Oath will be considered to be
 fulfilled, and no longer in effect.  Thus said Oath can never come to
 Civil Court twice.

 In the extremely unusual case that for some reason a non-monetary penalty
   is required, the Judge of the Suit may submit an NRC Proposal to the
   Public Forum requesting such a punishment.  Such a Proposal would have
   an Adoption Index of 1.
 
 The Decision may be appealed through an NRC Proposal.

 In the case that a Judge abandons the Suit, by doing any of the following:
	a) Not responding with Judgement within 7 days
	b) Not submitting Settlements and Penalties within 3 days
   e shall be penalized by .5 Marks and a new Judge shall be assigned
   randomly from the list of Active Players, excluding the Plaintiff
   and Defendant, and e who abandoned the Suit.

 Once a Judge has completed both Judgement and Settlement/Penalty, e shall
   be paid .5 Marks for eir trouble.
 It is recommended that the Civil Court be used primarily to resolve
 arguments over Corporations, Stocks and Dividends, Oaths, and similar
 disputes over agreements.  Later additions to the Ruleset may provide
 other reasons to use the Civil Courts; this Rule yields to their
 greater Wisdom. 
 ***END PROTO

 Obviously, comments in [] will not be part of the Proposal.

 In a moment, the revised Oaths.

Ah, yes, I was working on this with my refferenda.  I allowed extras, so 
that we didn't get:

Plantiff: Defendant gets twenty Marks for each player.
Defendant: Defendant gets thirty Marks from each player.

A good one though.

  Here's the Re-Revised Super-Duper Civil Courts Proto.  Changes: Fixed the
  plaintiff/defendant mistake in qualification 3, changed "Decision" to
  "Verdict", cuz it sounds cooler :)
 
 
PROTO-Proposal DB10 (Vanyel)
Civil Courts
(Creates a rule)
  
  It is possible for any Player(s) to sue any other Player(s) or Entity(s) in
  the Civil Court.  In order to sue, all of the following conditions must be
  met:
  
  	1) The Player(s) who wishes to sue must pay to the Bank a "service
  	   charge" of .5 Marks.   [This prevents frivolous Suing.]
  	2) The Suing Player must send a message to the Clerk of the 
  	   Courts stating that e wishes to sue.  E must state the Name
 	   of a Player or other Nomic Entity whom he wishes to sue, and
 	   for what reason.  If multiple Players wish to Sue, one of 
 	   them must be selected to submit the Suit, and must include
 	   the names of all other Player involved.  Each of these Players
	   must send a message to the CotC confirming their pariticipation.
 	   They may split the service charge any way they wish.  If they
 	   wish to bring multiple Entities to Suit, all such Entities must
 	   be explicitly mentioned in the Suit.
 	3) Each Player who is Suing may be known as "Plaintiff", and the set
 	   of all Plaintiffs for a given Suit may be known as "Plaintiff".
 	   Each Entity being Sued shall be known as "Defendant", and the set
 	   of all Defendants for a given Suit may be known as "Defendant".
 	   [This allows this Rule and all subsequent to refer only in the
 	   singular.]
  	4) The Clerk of the Courts must verify that the service charge
  	   has been paid, then e must assign a judge randomly from the
  	   list of all Active Players excluding the Plaintiff and Defendant.
 	   The Clerk shall then post a Notice to the Public Forum which
 	   states the offence, who is suing, and who is judging.  The 
 	   Notice must include "CCC #X", where X is the number of the Suit.
 	   Suits shall be numbered sequentially beginning with 1.
 	   [CCC == Civil Court Case, btw]
 
  Upon the announcement of the Suit, the Plaintiff may submit a complete
  argument to the Public Forum describing why the Defendant is in error.
  Likewise the Defendant may submit an argument to the Public Forum in
  eir own defence.  Either Plaintiff or Defendant may waive eir right to
  these submissions, but if they will submit such an argument they must
  do so within 72 Hours of the announcement of the Suit.
  
  The matter over which a Plaintiff sues must not specifically break any Rule.
  If it does, in fact, break one of these other Rules, then it must be taken
  care of through CFJ.  It must be a matter which has caused great personal
  wrong (as determined by the Plaintiff) and which breaks a specific agreement
  made between the Plaintiff and the Defendant.  Alternatively, the Plaintiff
  may sue for "Defamation of Character".  In order for the Plaintiff to do
  this, the Defendant must have posted something in the Public Forum which
  was both false and which in some way damaged their public image.  The 
  Judge of such a Suit is advised to use extreme discretion when returning
  a Verdict.
  
  The Judge of such a case must review it and come to a decision.  If e
  wishes, e may receive outside input on eir decision, but e must
  make a decision within a week of the original Notice.  Said decision
  must be "PLAINTIFF" or "DEFENDANT".  If the Judge decides in favor of
  the Plaintiff, then the Defendant must pay the Bank the service charge,
  which shall subsequently be refunded to the Plaintiff.  The Verdict
  shall be posted to the Public Forum.
 
  In the event that the Verdict is "PLAINTIFF", the Plaintiff, Defendant,
  and any Agora Nomic Player may submit suggested Settlements and Penalties.
  Both the Settlement and the Penalty shall be deducted from the accounts of
  the Defendant (in the case of a multiple-Entity Defendant, the Entities
  may divide payment of Settlement and Penalty in any way between them).  The
  Settlement shall be payed to the Plaintiff as recompense for damages, and 
  the Penalty shall revert to Agora (the Bank for Marks, the Point Reserve
  for Points).  The Judge must select a Settlement and Penalty from among
  the submissions within 72 hours of eir Verdict.  If no submissions have
  been made by that time the Judge is permitted to create eir own Penalty
  and Settlement. (Note that Settlements and Penalties of zero or negative
  amounts are permissible.)
 
  The Settlement shall be posted to the Public Forum.  If the Judgement is
  PLAINTIFF, the Defendant is obligated to pay any Settlements or Penalties
  to the appropriate parties, as well as reimburse the Plaintiff for the
  Service Charge.  If the Judgement is DEFENDANT, there is no such Penalty
  or Settlement.
 
  When dealing with Oaths, the Civil Court Case takes precedence.  Upon
  judgement over whether the Oath was broken, and following the carrying
  out of Settlements and Penalties, the Oath will be considered to be
  fulfilled, and no longer in effect.  Thus, said Oath can never come to
  Civil Court twice.
 
  In the extremely unusual case that for some reason a non-monetary penalty
  is required, the Judge of the Suit may submit an NRC Proposal to the
  Public Forum requesting such a punishment.  Such a Proposal would have
  an Adoption Index of 1.

[***Kelly: in the language of your proposals, do you use "Adoption Index"]
[or something else for this type of NRC Proposal?]
  
  The Verdict may be appealed through an NRC Proposal.
 
  In the case that a Judge abandons the Suit, by doing any of the following:
 	a) Not responding with Judgement within 7 days
 	b) Not submitting Settlements and Penalties within 3 days
    e shall be penalized by .5 Marks and a new Judge shall be assigned
    randomly from the list of Active Players, excluding the Plaintiff
    and Defendant, and e who abandoned the Suit.
 
  Once a Judge has completed both Judgement and Settlement/Penalty, e shall
    be paid .5 Marks for eir trouble.
  It is recommended that the Civil Court be used primarily to resolve
  arguments over Corporations, Stocks and Dividends, Oaths, and similar
  disputes over agreements.  Later additions to the Ruleset may provide
  other reasons to use the Civil Courts; this Rule yields to their
  greater Wisdom. 
  ***END PROTO
 
  Obviously, comments in [] will not be part of the Proposal.
