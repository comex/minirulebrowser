IMO, it should not be necessary to blow a great deal of effort
motivating the "political machine" in order to adopt an
uncontroversial Proposal.  However, since you seem to feel that this
is a desirable situation:

I hereby expend 1 P-Note to lower the Priority of the Proposal with
queue number #75 by one.

I hereby exercise my Promotor's Privilege to raise the Priority of the 
proposal with queue number #72 by one.

I also resign from the Threat; clearly this Group no longer represents 
my interests.
