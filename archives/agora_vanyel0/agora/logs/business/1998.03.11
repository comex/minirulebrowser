I claim that this report is in error, in that all calls for
Impeachment actually succeeded.  See prior discussion.

Protoproposal: Zeitgeist and scarce currencies

Amend 1047 by replacing the sentence

      When an Interested Proposal Proposed by some Player is adopted
      with no votes cast AGAINST it, that Player is awarded the Patent
      Title of Zeitgeist.

with 

      When an Interested Proposal Proposed by some Player is adopted
      with no votes cast AGAINST it, and at least three different
      voting entities voted for it, that Player is awarded the Patent
      Title of Zeitgeist.

[This avoids an undue proliferation of Zeitgeist titles, just because
we are all trying to save our VTs and let uncontroversial proposals
pass with the votes of their proposers.

The idea is not mine; I forget who first mentioned it. The main reason
I'm protoing this is that I want to make sure I don't take this idea
away from someone else who wanted to propose it.]

H. Assessor,

sorry for not putting all votes into one message, but I hereby vote
against P3704, twice - not because I don't like it, but because I
believe that such a huge reform project should only pass if some
players other than the proposer emself are willing to support the
project actively (i.e. vote FOR instead of just being present).

[ For those of you with no sense of fun. ;) ]

--------------------------------------------------------------
Impeachment Proceedings [#1] (3/3/98 - 3/10/98)
--------------------------------------------------------------

Called by Sherlock on 3/3/98.

All Impeachments Pass on 3/10/98.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Due to an apparent mistake in the Impeachment Rules, any Call
for Impeachment which currently reaches Quorum passes
automatically.  Due to another oversight, all of the Officers
who would have been Impeached escaped this by delegating their
positions.

--------------------------------------------------------------

As the total number of FOR, AGAINST, and ABSTAIN votes did not
effect the final outcome of the Impeachment process (other
than fulfilling Quorum), they have not been counted.  However,
for information's sake, all Player's votes are listed below.
Note that then when an Officer is listed as voting on "all
impeachments", it is assumed that this does not include an
Office said Officer was holding.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Final tally of votes:

Antimatter - voted FOR all impeachments
Blob     - voted AGAINST all impeachments
Chuck    - voted FOR impeachment of Speaker-Elect Blob
	   voted AGAINST all other impeachments

		                    Clerk of the Courts elJefe

More accurately, they passed, but had no effect.

In addition, I believe you are required (by Rule 1434) to reveal the
name of each entity casting a Vote, and the Vote cast by that entity;
something you have failed to do as of yet.

And, finally, I note that your use of artist's renditions of

Proto-Proposal
Encourage VT spending

This Proposal has an Adoption Index of 3.

[Comment: the current Proposal/voting system allows VT expenditure
to drop to almost nothing as a response to VT scarcity: it only takes
1 VT to pass a Proposal, provided enough Players declare Presence.
I propose to block that avenue of escape from scarcity by raising
the minimum expenditure required to pass a Proposal to 3 VTs. I also
clarify the status of uncancelled votes with respect to R955.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 955 be amended to read:

      When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the
      uncancelled votes which have been legally cast shall be counted
      by the Assessor. The Proposal shall then be assigned a Voting
      Index, as follows: if the Proposal received no votes opposed,
      and at least one vote in favor, the Voting Index shall be
      Unanimity; if there are no votes in favor, the Voting Index
      shall be zero; in all other cases, the Voting Index shall be
      the number of votes in favor divided by the number of votes
      opposed.

      If the Voting Index is greater than the Adoption Index for the
      Proposal, or if both equal Unanimity, and there were at
      least three votes in favor of the Proposal, then that Proposal
      passes.  Otherwise, it fails.

Hm. The Subject (and agora-business destination) of the message
notwithstanding, this was intended only as a proto for discussion, as
the text indicates, not as a Proposal submission. I don't know what
weirdness inspired me to send it to a-b, since I usually send protos
to a-d.

It's my view that this message does not fulfil the requirement in
R1483 that the text of a Proposal submission "clearly indicat[e]"
that the text is intended to be a Proposal, and hence that it is
not a Proposal. But just in case 'Encourage VT spending' is now in
the Queue, I hereby remove it under the authority of R1774.
