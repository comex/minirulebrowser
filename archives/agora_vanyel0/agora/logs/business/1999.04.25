Okay, it's seems to me that it is about time to set the Wheels of
Justice a-turning. Now I'm not one for calling Criminal cases, so I'll
leave that to the better informed, but I am concerned about one or two
issues of fact:

I call for judgement on the following statement:

     Rule 1883 has not been repealed.

Arguments:
----------

On Steve sent a message with the following headers to nomic-business:

> Date: Fri, 16 Apr 1999 10:11:36 +1000
> To: agora-business@gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au
> From: janet9981@yahoo.com
> Subject: Maximize your website's traffic!

This message contained the following text, deliberately hidden among
a piece of spam:

> I hereby submit the following Proposal, entitled "An Object Lesson"
> delimited by triple dashes, and request that it have an Adoption Index
> I hereby submit the following Proposal, entitled "An Object Lesson"
> delimited by triple dashes, and request that it have an Adoption Index
> of 4. --- Rule 1883 is repealed. A Power = 4 Rule entitled "An Object
> Lesson" is created with the following text: "This Rule was inserted into
> the Ruleset to warn against the dangers of, and to commemorate Steve's
> long and ultimately successful battle against R1883 (Adoption of
> Proposals Without Objection)."--- I hereby announce my intention to
> adopt "A Separation of Powers" and "An Object Lesson" Without Objection.

1483 states, in part:

      A Proposal is created whenever a Proposing Entity delivers some
      collection of text to the Public Forum with the clear indication
      that that text is intended to become a Proposal.

I argue that there was no "clear indication" that "An Object Lesson" was
intended to become a Proposal. Common sense tells us that a message
like this, hidden in a large body of unrelated text, is anything but
a "clear indication", regardless of what the message itself says.

Since "An Object Lesson" never became a Proposal, it could not be
adopted Without Objection, and so Rule 1883 remains unrepealed.

Ooops. Slip of the mouse. Obviously that text was not supposed to 
appear twice.

Oh, and "hidden among" should probably be "hidden inside". I really 
ought to proofread my CFJs.

CFJ 1124  "Votes sent to the agora-discussion mailing list are neither
           'sent publically' nor 'sent privately', and so are not valid
           when voting is Unrestricted."
          4/20  Called by Blob
          4/20  Assigned to Elysion
          Caller's argument (summary):  By defining the Public and
            Private modes of Voting, Rule 1764 defines "publically" and
            "privately".  Messages to a-d fit neither definition.

CFJ 1125  "Rule 1883 has not been repealed."
          4/24  Called by Blob
          Caller's argument (summary):  "An Object Lesson" was embedded
            in a spam message, so did not give a "clear indication" of
            being a Proposal as required by Rule 1483.

I become a Legislator.

I pay 1 P-Note to raise the Priority of this Proposal.


Proposal:  The Spiraling Cost of Voting

Create a new Rule titled "The Voting Factor" with this text:

      The Voting Factor is a real number between 0.1 and 10
      inclusive.  Unless the Rules give it another value, the
      Voting Factor is 1.

      The Assessor may change the value of the Voting Factor by
      announcing the new value in the Public Forum, provided that
      e announces a value within the range proscribed above, that
      e makes the announcement prior to midnight GMT Thursday, and
      that e has not already made such an announcement earlier in
      the Week. The new value of the Voting Factor does not take
      effect until the beginning of the Nomic Week after the
      change has been announced.

Amend Rule 1442 (The Cost of Voting) to read:

      Votes on Proposals have a voting cost, based on the Voting
      Tariff and Voting Factor at the time they were distributed.
      If either of these had no value set at that time, then they
      are deemed to have been 1 VT and 1, respectively.

      The voting cost of an entity's first vote on a Proposal is
      equal to the Voting Tariff.  The voting cost of each additional
      vote by that entity on that Proposal is equal to the previous
      vote's cost multiplied by the Voting Factor, then rounded up to
      the nearest multiple of the MUQ of VTs.

      As soon as possible after the end of the Voting Period of a
      given Proposal, the Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity a
      number of Voting Tokens equal to the total cost of the votes
      cast on that Proposal by that entity.

I apologize for my silence lately. My ISP made a change to their network
that blocks SMTP connections. Needless to say, I'll be changing ISPs
shortly. I've been able to receive messages all this time, but not send.


I hereby declare PRESENT on proposal 3856 and cast one vote FOR proposal
3855.


I also hereby announce the completion of probate for macross's estate (and
wow, I actually posted it to a Public Forum this time ;)

Elysion
