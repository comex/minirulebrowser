INP 348 was accepted.  Agora scores 2 points.
Agora voted for; all other voting members abstained.

Create a Rule with the text:

The liaison of a nomic can only be changed by that nomic, and such a change
is not effective until notice of it has been sent to the the internomic
mailing list. The moderator can only be changed as specified in the Rules.

Create a Rule with the text:

The liaison of any member nomic can sent a message to the mailing list,
claiming that the moderator is not present. If the moderator does not send
any message to the mailing list during the complete period of fourteen
days starting at the time of this message, the liaison of the nomic
who claimed that the moderator was not present becomes moderator
automatically.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

comment: Neither Rule 216 nor Rule 323 forbids the change of liaisons
and moderators. This proposal would cure that situation. The second rule
is to avoid that absence of the moderator would block the game.

"Calabresi is ineligible to serve as a Justice in the Appeal of 
 CFJ 933."

Judgement: TRUE

Reasons and arguments: 

R911 spells out the conditions under which a Player is ineligible for
selection as Justice.  It is clear and undisputed by the Caller that
Calabresi doesn't satisfy conditions i, ii, iii or v.

The question remains: was Calabresi ineligible to Judge the original
CFJ?  If so, then they are ineligible to serve as Justice in the
Appeal of that CFJ by condition iv.

This question needs careful consideration.  In particular, what sense
are we to make of the "was" in condition iv?  

It's clearly ridiculous to claim that this refers to arbitrary
instants of time in history, as we were all ineligible to judge CFJs
before they were called, before we joined the game or before the game
started. 

In fact the wording of the relevant rules makes it clear the
eligibility is an attribute that should only be calculated when a CFJ
is assigned a Judge.  

Here we come to our next problem: when the CFJ was first assigned,
Calabresi was not a Player.  The rules do not explicitly discuss the
eligibility status of non-Players, so we have to turn to common-sense
and game custom to tell us that non-Players are not eligible as
Judges.   (The language of the Judge selection rule (R951) tells us
that Judges are to be selected from amongst eligible Players, not
necessarily implying that other classes of people are ineligible.
However, here the common-sense view of what it is to be eligible must
be appealed to, if it is impossible for one to be selected for
something because of one's status, this is equivalent to being
ineligible.)

Therefore Calabresi is ineligible to serve as a Justice in the appeal
of CFJ 933.

Michael.
