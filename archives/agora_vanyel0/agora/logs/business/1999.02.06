The following Proposal is to be titled "Cleanup of R.1006" and is to

**START PROPOSAL
Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1006 be amended to read:

      (a) An Office is any position established by the Rules as such.

      (b) At any time, a given Office is held by exactly one Player. 
          If an Office would otherwise not be held by any Player, it
          shall be held by the Speaker.

      (c) An Officer is any Player who holds an Office.

      (d) A given Office has whatever duties, responsibilities, and
          privileges that the Rules assign to it.

[Most of the rest of the current R.1006 is superfluous baggage.]

The following Proposal is to be titled "Some Housecleaning" and is to
have Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 408 be amended to read:

      (a) The Judge of an open CFJ is required to, within seven days
          of when that CFJ last became open or seven days of eir
          assignment to that CFJ, whichever is later, close that CFJ
          by dismissing or judging the CFJ and/or granting or denying
          any outstanding judicial motions pertaining to that CFJ.

      (b) The failure of a Judge to close a case within the prescribed
          time constitutes the Infraction of Judicial Tardiness and
          carries a penalty of one Blot for each day (or fraction
          thereof) that the case remains open beyond the permitted
          time.  This penalty is to be reported by the Clerk of the
          Courts.

      (c) The failure to observe this time limit does not, by itself,
          cause the delinquent Judge to be recused from the CFJ, nor
          does it invalidate eir judgment or dismissal of the CFJ or
          grant or denial of any related judicial motion which that
          Judge might submit after the limit has expired.

      (d) This Rule defers to any other Rule which prescribes a
          different time limit in which a CFJ must be closed, and to
          any other Rule which establishes procedures by which the
          time limit specified in this Rule may be extended or
          shortened.

==========================================================================
                               CFJ 1117

  Players may bar Players from Judgement in the sense of Rule 897 by
  specifying the Players to be barred at a time other than that of the
  submission of the CFJ.

==========================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

This possibility is not prohibited by R897, and so, by our general
principle of the permissibility of the unprohibited (R116), is
permitted.  The Judge may wish to expand on the effect that a barring
might have if specified after a Judge selection was made.  I think
precedent (specifically, the decision that Players can not make
themselves ineligible for CFJs not yet called), makes it clear that
one couldn't bar possible judges before actually making a CFJ.

==========================================================================
I judge the Statement of CFJ1117 to be TRUE.

Argument:

I believe the Caller’s Arguments are correct.

R897 does not specify how or when, a Caller may bar players from judging 
a CFJ.  So I believe R116 holds for this case.  Provided that it is 
clear which CFJ  the players are barred from, and the person barring 
them is the Caller.  (These conditions are obvious from the rules.)  The 
time at which the Caller bars them is irrelevant.   Hence, I have to 
conclude that the statement of the CFJ is TRUE.


My Opinions:        (As requested from the Caller’s Argument)

Considering R1860, 

Rule 1868/0 (Power=1)
Selecting a Judge

      Whenever there is an open Call for Judgement to which no Player
      has been assigned as its Judge, the Clerk of the Court shall, as
      soon as possible after being made aware of this condition,
      select a Player to be assigned as its Judge.  This selection
      shall be made from amongst all those Players eligible to serve
      as the Judge of that CFJ.

>From my reading of this rule I conclude that if the Clerk of the Court 
has not assigned a player to be a judge for a given CFJ.  Then the 
caller is still open to bar players, if this is before OR after they 
have posted their CFJ.  Provided that there is a clear indication of 
which CFJ the Caller is referring to.  This would be most likely done by 
number after the CFJ has been called, but could also be achieved by 
quoting the statement.

The Caller in my opinion should be allowed to bar players after the 
Clerk of the Court has assigned a judge.  This would not change the 
judge at that time, but if the judge was then to change, (E.g. the judge 
ceases to be a Player.) then the players which the Caller has barred, 
would still be barred.

Also I believe that this is entirely different from Players making 
themselves ineligible to serve, and so no precedents are broken.  If the 
Caller knows who might be biased, then he should be able to bar them.  
Also this knowledge could become known to the Caller before or after he 
makes the CFJ.    I assume CFJ1101 was to prevent blanket 
ineligibilities.  E.g. declaring yourself in eligible to judge on CFJs 
1100 to 2000.  The Caller could bar players in the same manner only if 
he was sure he was going to be the Caller of CFJs 1100 to 2000.  As this 
is very unlikely I believe my reading of the rules is in the best 
interests and the spirit of Agora.



Peekee

I hope this is what is required of me as a judge.  I didn’t get much 
time look over past CFJs so I hope this setout and such like is ok.

While I agree that Peekee's Judgement is correct, I also believe that
Vlad's observation, that Rule 1868 precludes barring a Judge after e
has been selected, is also correct.  I therefore seek signatures to a
Concurring Opinion, to be attached to this Judgement, to read as
follows:

While we concur with Judge Peekee's Judgement in this CFJ, we would
like to note that Rule 1868 (specifically, that parge which reads
"Once assigned as the Judge of a CFJ, that Player remains the Judge of
that CFJ until e is recused from that CFJ, or e ceases to be a
Player.") operates to prevent a Player from Barring a Judge after e
has been selected.  Thus, the Caller of a CFJ may bar up to three
Players at any point, but may not bar the Player actually selected as
Judge, as long as e remains Judge; or, at least, the act of barring
the already-selected Judge would not cause em to cease to be the Judge
of that CFJ.
