ProtoProposal
Time Requirements

Create a Rule with the text:

      If a Rule requires a player to perform an action at a particular
      time, the Rule shall be interpreted as requiring the action to be
      performed within a reasonable period after that time.  This Rule
      takes precedence over such a Rule.

      A "reasonable period" shall be at most 7 days unless a Rule sets
      a different time period, or unless the action was impossible during
      the specified time period.

      If a Rule authorizes and requires a player to perform an action at
      the beginning of a nomic week, then the player is authorized and
      required to perform that action during that week. This Rule takes
      precedence over such a Rule.

Create a Rule with the text:

      If a Rule authorizes a player to perform an action during a time
      period, then a player failing to perform that action during the
      time period is not thereby authorized to perform that action at
      a later time, unless so provided by the Rules.  This Rule takes
      precedence over such a Rule.

R-O-M Business

There are 288 Rules in the current Rule set.  The following numbers were spit
out by my random number generator:

200 = Rule 1754 Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank
201 = Rule 1763 Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank II
126 = Rule 1575 Standards of Proof
101 = Rule 1069 Amendment Numbers
255 = Rule 1531 Administrators and Their Duties

I swear, this really was a random drawing.  8)

Obviously, we do not need two versions of the Inadvertent Transfer Rule.  But I
also noted, when I was involved in such a transaction, that it is not a very
pragmatic implementation.  The obligation to reverse the transfer is imposed
automatically on the Chancellor, rather than being initiated by a PO.  I would
expect Scott to have a slight problem with this and I'm tempted to select both
for the ax.  On the other hand, it's a fairly easy fix so I'll just select Rule
1763 for this week and maybe come up with a proto for R1754.

So, if anyone wants to sponsor this, please refer to P3683 or the title, Repeal
Rule 1763 (Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank II).

Oh, OK. I'm not at all sure how this should be handled. My Probate 
plan called (and properly so) for me to vacate all POs outstanding at 
the time it was implemented, so the fact that I failed to vacate one 
of them might mean that I have yet to implement the entire Plan.

Just to be on the safe side : insofar as this is required for the
implementation of the plan for the disposition of the estate of
Morendil, and if legally possible, I hereby vacate POI712. I hereby
announce, if such was not already the case, that the Probate of
Morendil is complete.

It wasn't inadvertent. Rule 1601 includes the following definition :

      2. Debt: a Payment Orders naming the entity in Probate as payor.

This would seem to include satisfied, disputed or even vacated 
Payment Orders. The Probate Code states :

      All debts, whether satisfied in full or not, shall be
      cancelled.

Thus I concluded that satisfied POs were also to be vacated. OTOH, 
I'm not sure that I had quite realized the implications... ;)
