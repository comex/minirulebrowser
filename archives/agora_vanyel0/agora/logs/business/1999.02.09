I Judge the statement FALSE.  "X does not exist" is not equivalent to "X is
zero".  For a concrete example, consider these hypothetical Rules:

     Rule 3000A
     The Justiciar's Salary is zero VTs.

     Rule 3000B
     The Justiciar's Salary is one VT.

Clearly 3000A and 3000B conflict.  But the relevant clause of 910/6 does not
conflict with 3000B, so it cannot be equivalent to 3000A.
