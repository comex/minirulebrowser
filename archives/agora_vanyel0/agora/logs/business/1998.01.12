I believe "Swann's Frankenstein Contest" is the Mintor of the Currency
"Frankenstein Monsters".  Swann, would you please inform us all as to
how many Frankenstein Monsters (if any) each entity in Probate holds,
so that proper Plans may be submitted?

COE on latest Herald's Report

The report is in error because it failed to list the Blot gained by Morendil as
a result of Steve's message persuant to CFJ 1078.  

I hereby admit this claim.  The relevant line in the report should read:

                   Indulgences  Blots      Indulgences  Blots
 Morendil              9        51             0        45

Also, there should be an additional PO listed in the outstanding PO section:

POI700 for one Indulgence from Morendil to the Bank, Steve as executor.

-- Crito

P.S.  Steve, could you please send me a copy of the headers, if you still have
it, to that message so I can get the time stamps right in the next report. 
Thanks.

I vote FOR INP358.

Before I vote on this, are there any interesting plans for the use of "Subers"
that have a chance of being implemented soon, or is this just going to hang
around as a useless trinket for a long time?

Well, if you haven't got a clue, then there must not have been much discussion
about it on the IN list anyway.  In that case, I think they should put forth a

just their creation.

I hereby vote AGAINST INP359.

I hereby make the following two Proposals, paying the Petition
fee for each of them.

------------------------------------

PROPOSAL: Inform the Assessor whence come yer Votes

Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: Attributing Additional Votes)

     For each vote beyond the first two an entity casts on a particular 
     Proposal, that entity must provide to the Assessor the Rule Numbers 
     of the Rules that permit the casting of that additional vote.  If 
     these Rule Numbers are not provided to the Assessor before the end 
     of the voting period for that Proposal, the Assessor has the option
     to not count more than two votes on that Proposal from that entity.

{Comment: I want to add a number of Rules that allow entities to cast 
          additional votes, so I thought that this might make the 
          Assessor's life easier.}
------------------------------------

PROPOSAL: Officer's Veto

Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: The Officer's Vote)

     If a particular Proposal amends the duties or description of a 
     particular Office, and a Player holds that Office in normal 
     fashion, and that Player is not the same Player who Proposed the 
     Proposal, then that Player may cast two additional votes on that 
     Proposal beyond what e is otherwise entitled to cast.  This shall 
     not increase the maximum number of votes that are permitted to be
     cast by that Player.

{Comment: Pretty self-explanatory.  It's meant to give an Officer a
          little more voice in the running of eir job.}

R-O-M Business

Since I've got a nice current Ruleset to work with, I'll get this out of the
way early this week.  And with my dial-up back online, I'm back to using my
handy-dandy Scheme random number generator again.  By my count, there are now
287 Rules.  The following five numbers were generated:

275 = Rule 1008 The Shogun - Nope, should be some reward for high Kudos.
109 = Rule 1558 Defaults for Elections of Officers - Nope, 'nuff said.
228 = Rule 755 Champions - Nope, winning should mean something tangible.
004 = Rule 1700 Defense of Marriage Act - Was this supposed to generate a scam?
238 = Rule 1658 Tainting the Speaker - Nope, nice ammunition for Players.

So, as Promotor I select Rule 1700 for the Repeal-O-Matic this week.  If anyone
wants to sponsor this, please refer to it by title "Repeal Rule 1700" or by
number P3672.

I hereby claim that the above is in error, in that Harlequin did not
win on or around the time listed.  I have two arguments for believing
this.  I feel the first is stronger, but even if the first argument is
rejected the second must still be considered.

>From Rule 1729:

      And should it occur (due to greed or sin)
      that no one Votes FOR it, the Proposer shall Win.

In CFJ 1078, Judge Blob agreed with Caller Steve's reasoning that
Morendil *did* vote on P3640, and that the later retraction of those
votes (1 FOR and 1 AGAINST), did not change the fact that he had
voted on it.

Secondly, even if the above argument is rejected, in contravention of
the Judgement of CFJ 1078, the reason that no one voted FOR
P3640 was that it was against the Rules to do so--not
"due to greed or sin" as required by R1729.

H. Promotor Crito,

I hereby submit the following Proposal, paying the Petition Fee to do
so.

####
Proposal
Tweak R1465 (Champion's Reward)

[Comment: R1465 was incompletely pragmatized by PC: strictly speaking,
it is impossible for the Registrar to pay out the VTs 'at the onset'
of the Champion's Reward.]

Be it hereby resolved that R1465 (Champion's Reward) be amended by
replacing the text

      At the onset of that Player's Champion's Reward, the Registrar
      shall pay out ten VTs to that Player.

with the text

      As soon as possible after the legal and correct announcement
      that a Player has won a Game, the Registrar shall pay out ten
      Voting Tokens to that Player.
####
