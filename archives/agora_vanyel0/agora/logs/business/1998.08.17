Judgement: FALSE

I concur with with the original judge, lee, in saying that Macross'
Order were never executed, because they were not submitted directly 
to Swann. I argue that sending something via the Public Forum is not
the same as sending it directly. Intuitively, the Public Forum is
an "intermediate step" which makes the submission indirect.

Justice Michael, while acknowledging this difference, argues that
Rule 478 establishes the legal fiction that the two are indeed 
equivalent (an argument that wouldn't be necessary if the intuitive
distinction didn't exist). The relevant part of R478, I think, is:

      Sending a message, by any medium or combination of media, to
      every Active Player, is equivalent to sending it to the Public
      Forum, provided that the message bears a clear indication that
      it is intended to be a message to the Public Forum, and it is
      verifiable that the message was in fact sent to every Active
      Player.

While a strictly logical reading of this rule might take "is equivalent
to" to mean that the two methods of submission are interchangeable, I
would argue that this is not the natural meaning of this rule. Rather
this rule seeks to allow sending directly to all players as an 
alternative to sending to the PF. It is, in the opinion of this judge,
a misapplication of this rule to reverse this, and claim that sending
to the Public Forum is an acceptable means of sending something 
directly to a Player.

I do not believe that it is within the jurisdiction of this judge to
define in any positive sense what "submitting directly" is, only what
it isn't. I will leave it to another judge to determine the matter in
greater detail, as becomes necessary.

The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of
a VOC directive was the report published in the PF on 1996/08/13
(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

AFAIK, no Herald's Report has ever been successfully ratified.
