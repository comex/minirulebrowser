I vote FOR Proposal 3577.

Might I suggest that the electorate not waste votes on 3578, which was
inadvisably Proposed in the middle of its proto process.  I intend to
resume that process shortly, ultimately leading to another Proposal.

[This simply removes all references to P-notes and the concept of
interested proposals from the Rules. 

Remarks in square brackets [] are not part of the (proto) proposal.]


Amend the following rules:


1727: replace the string "one P-note each from the Bank to each Player
who posts to the Public Forum during Agora's BIrth" (in the last
paragraph but two of version 2 of this rule) by "one Voting Token each
from theBank to each Player who posts to the Public Forum during
Agora's Birthday"

replace the string " and shall pay out to each such Contest 5
VTs, and to their Contestmasters 2 P-Notes each" (in the last
paragraph but one of version 2 of this rule) by "and shall pay out to
each such Contest 5 Voting Tokens."


1451: in the first sentence of the second paragraph, "The Assessor
shall bill the disowning Player a fee of one P-Note.", replace "one
P-note" with "two Voting Tokens".

[It might be simpler to repeal this rule altogether, but then 1065
becomes kind of useless.]


947: replace the string "the Rulekeepor shall pay out 3 P-Notes to the
Proposer of that Proposal." by "the Rulekeepor shall pay out one
Voting Token to the Proposer of that Proposal."


1678: replace the string "If an Interested Proposal passes," by "If a
Proposal passes,"


1047: replace the string "When an Interested Proposal Proposed by some
Player" by "When a Proposal Proposed by some Player".

replace the string "the Assessor shall pay out one P-Note to that
Player." by "the Assessor shall pay out one Voting Token to that Player."


1705: replace the string "the Wizard shall pay out to each Player with a positive Style Point rating a number of P-Notes
equal to half their Style," by "the Wizard shall pay out to each
Player with a positive Style Point rating a number of Voting Tokens
equal to a third of their Style,"

[Note that a change of the rule's title would be appropriate if this
is accepted]


1723: delete the string ", and it is not Disinterested", and the
sentence "The Petition Fee for a Sane Proposal is increased by three."


1724: delete the string ", and it is not Disinterested" and the
sentence "The Petition Fee for an Emergency Proposal is increased by
two.

[Question re 1723 and 1724: should a price for making such proposals
reintroduced? How can that be done without keeping the whole petition
fee mechanism just for this purpose?]


1036: replace the string "accompanied by its Number, the identity of
its Proposing Entity, and a clear indication of whether the Proposal
is Disinterested." by "accompanied by its Number and the identity of
its Proposing Entity."


1729: replace the string "An Interested Proposal is Insane," by "Any
Proposal submitted is Insane,"

[Anyone have a better change? I tried to preserve the meter, though
there isn't a clear metric structure of this rule, anyway.]

---

Repeal the following rules:

833 (Awards & Penalties for Proposals)
1583 (Proposal Penalties Halved for New Players)
1701 (Proposal Notes)
1702 (Petition Fee for Proposals)
1623 (Disinterested Proposals)

---

[Comments:

- On many occasions P-note rewards or fees are replaced by VT awards,
e.g. 1727, 1451,

In some of these cases I have reduced the amount of VTs, because I
think they are more valuable than P-Notes used to be. Maybe this
should be done even more rigorously.

- There being no other limitations to the number of proposals, maybe
the Penalty for too many proposals should be made more severe, say one
blot instead of 0.5 VTs? (see R 1065)]
