This is a typo.  This is meant to read: The Mint ceased to exist.
Therefore, the Mint, being the Mintor of VTs, ceased to exist, so all VTs
were destroyed.

CFJ933 Results

While we are waiting for Andre to post the official results, I thought I would
run this by the Players for verification.

1)  There are no individual instances of P-Notes.  Since P-Notes currently
    have no Mintor, they cannot be considered a Currency.  Therefore, no
    Payment Orders have ever existed for P-Notes.

2)  There are no individual instances of Indulgences.  However, due to
    higher precedence, Indulgences *are* a Currency and therefore Payment
    Orders for Indulgeces exist, even though they currently have no Mintor.

-- Crito

PS  I will hold off on my reports until the official results of CFJ933 are
posted.

Thought I'd add a little comic relief. Apologies if this has been tried
before.

Note Rule 1707:

1707
	Any change in an Entity's Location is known as Movement.

      An Entity Moves when its Executor tells the Cartographor where
      it Moves to, given that the Movement is otherwise permitted by
      the Rules.
///////////
SO........

Mr. Cartographer, please note that I am moving to Limbo.

Now, is this legal? I think so. The only question is, is this movement
"otherwise permitted by the Rules"? It certainly is not forbidden, and is
permitted by 116. I don't think 1011 applies here, since I am not claiming
that 116 gives me the ability to move, but that 116 allows me to activate
the provision of 1707 giving me the ability to move.
   My action also meets the minimum definition of a Movement, since my
Location has changed (I am no longer at the Welcoming Center). Note that a
Movement does not have to be *to* a Location to be legal (apparently).

Now, 1706 says, in part, 
 All Players have a Location.

So I am still located somewhere. Exactly where is somewhat indeterminate.
The only thing probably certain is that I am not at the Welcoming Center
(and, truth be told, it certainly not impossible that I am still there, in
which case the above Movement never really took place).

Anyone for a game of hide and seek?

Vlad

Hmm.  You might be right - I'll have to check the Rules more closely.  Of
course, then Blob would be a 'normal' Player, but without an Executor (except
for possibly the 'real' Blob?).  Interesting.

Hmm, again.  I hereby allege that Blob has Abandoned the game.
