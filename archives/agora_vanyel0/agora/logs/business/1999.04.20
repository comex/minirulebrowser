The following is a Proposal entitled "Taking Out the Trash", and
is delineated by ten dashes at the beginning and end. I also transfer
0.5 P-Notes to the Bank to raise its Priority by that amount.

----------
Create a Rule Entitled "Taking Out the Trash" with the following
text:

(with apologies to Mr. Jefferson)

Let it be known that Steve Gardner has behaved in a Hypocritical and
Dishonorable manner. To prove this, let the following Facts be
submitted to a candid World:

WHEREAS: Steve Gardner has, by impersonating another individual,
attempted to subvert the Good Faith basis of communications which is
the backbone of Agora...

WHEREAS: Steve Gardner has consistently opposed legislation that would
make it easier for the Sovereign Will of the Players to be expressed
by the Rules governing them, a right inestimable to them, and
formidable to Tyrants only...

WHEREAS: Steve Gardner has manipulated the Rules, not merely for
personal gain, which would accord with the Traditions of our Fair
Society, but to overthrow Legislation duly approved by the Players,
and replace it with other Legislation which had already been rejected
by those same Players...

WHEREAS: While protesting for the preservation of our traditional
System of Governance, and opposing recent Innovations, He has not
hesitated to employ those Innovations, when it suits him, to overthrow
decisions made in the Traditional Manner he claims to honor, thus
proving himself a Hypocrite and a Knave...

Let It Be Hereby Decided, that Steve Gardner shall be immediately
Deregistered from Agora, and shall be banned from Reregistration for a
period of six months. At the end of that period, this Rule shall
repeal itself, and his Crimes shall be forgiven.

I suppose I need to do the following:
I hereby become a Legislator. I then submit this proposal:


The following is a Proposal entitled "Taking Out the Trash", and
is delineated by ten dashes at the beginning and end. I also transfer
0.5 P-Notes to the Bank to raise its Priority by that amount.

Vlad

----------
Create a Rule Entitled "Taking Out the Trash" with the following
text:

(with apologies to Mr. Jefferson)

Let it be known that Steve Gardner has behaved in a Hypocritical and
Dishonorable manner. To prove this, let the following Facts be
submitted to a candid World:

WHEREAS: Steve Gardner has, by impersonating another individual,
attempted to subvert the Good Faith basis of communications which is
the backbone of Agora...

WHEREAS: Steve Gardner has consistently opposed legislation that would
make it easier for the Sovereign Will of the Players to be expressed
by the Rules governing them, a right inestimable to them, and
formidable to Tyrants only...

WHEREAS: Steve Gardner has manipulated the Rules, not merely for
personal gain, which would accord with the Traditions of our Fair
Society, but to overthrow Legislation duly approved by the Players,
and replace it with other Legislation which had already been rejected
by those same Players...

WHEREAS: While protesting for the preservation of our traditional
System of Governance, and opposing recent Innovations, He has not
hesitated to employ those Innovations, when it suits him, to overthrow
decisions made in the Traditional Manner he claims to honor, thus
proving himself a Hypocrite and a Knave...

Let It Be Hereby Decided, that Steve Gardner shall be immediately
Deregistered from Agora, and shall be banned from Reregistration for a
period of six months. At the end of that period, this Rule shall
repeal itself, and his Crimes shall be forgiven.

Proposal 3854 by Peekee, AI=1
Keep a Duty to Vote

Amend Rule 1873 (A Duty to Vote) by removing the text which reads,

"Three months after this Rule is created, it repeals itself."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 3855 by Vlad, AI=1
Cleaning up the Grand Agoran Tournament

* Amend Rule 1877 "Competitions" by replacing the paragraph reading:

To be valid, an AFT must also fulfill the following conditions:
        i) The proposed Team must consist of at least three Players
       ii) No two proposed Team members may belong to the same Circle.
      iii) No proposed Team Member may belong to an already existing
           Team.
      If any of the above three conditions ceases to be true, a Team
      is immediately dissolved and removed from the current Team
      Competition.

with one reading:

        i) The proposed Team must consist of at least three Players
       ii) No two proposed Team members may belong to the same Circle.
      iii) No proposed Team Member may belong to another Team.
      If any of the above three conditions ceases to be true, a Team
      is immediately dissolved and removed from the current Team
      Competition.

* Amend Rule 1879 "Scoring" by removing the paragraph reading:

      If three consecutive CFJs are Judged TRUE, FALSE and UNDECIDED
      (in any order), to the Player making the third CFJ: 17 Points.

* Amend Rule 1875 "The Grand Agoran Tournament" by replacing the
paragraph reading:

      The Grand Agoran Tournament consists of a series of Rounds.
      These Rounds begin on the First of March, June, September, and
      October of each year, and last for three months. The first Round
      begins March 1, 1999. At the beginning of each Round, the
      Scorekeepor will draw up a list of all Active Players in
      descending order of their Scores from the preceding Round. For
      the first Round, this will be done instead in descending order
      of the Players' combined P-Note and VT holdings taken from the
      most recent Official Reports. Ties will be broken by random
      selection.

Proposal 3856 by Oerjan, AI=1
April Fool

Append the following paragraph to Rule 1497 ("Truth in Advertising"):

      This Rule shall not apply to messages posted during April 1,
      GMT.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 3857 by General Chaos, AI=1
Taxes, revisited

Be it resolved, that Rule 1735 be amended to read:

      (a) The Chancellor is the Executor of the Bank.

      (b) As soon as possible after a Payment Order is executed for
          which the Bank is the payor, the Chancellor shall either (as
          the Bank's Executor) satisfy the Payment Order, or dispute
          it by making a COE or CFJ.  However, the Chancellor need not
          do so if another Player makes such a COE or CFJ first.

      (c) If the Chancellor submits a Transfer Order from the Bank for
          any reason other than to satisfy a Payment Order (except
          when specifically required by the Rules to submit a Transfer
          Order), e commits the Class A Crime of Misappropriation, and
          upon conviction of this Crime shall be removed from Office.

      (d) The Chancellor may (as the Bank's Executor) Mint new units
          of Currency of which the Bank is the Mintor, Without
          Objection.  The Bank may not otherwise Mint units of
          Currency.

      (e) For each Currency minted by the Bank, at most once in each
          month, the Chancellor may levy a tax on that Currency.  The
          amount of this tax shall not exceed fifty percent.  The
          Chancellor may exempt units of Currency from this taxation,
          provided that the exemptions are:
        (1) the same among all Players;
        (2) the same among all non-Players; and
        (3) at least as great with respect to Players as with
            non-Players.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1853 be amended to read:

      (a) When (and only when) an Officer is empowered to levy a tax
          on a Currency, e may do so by announcing the levy in the
          Public Forum.

      (b) Taxes may be levied only when the Rules explicitly permit
          it, and then only by the Officer authorized to impose that
          levy.

      (c) An Officer levies a tax by announcing it in a Public Forum.
          An announcement of levy must specify:
        (1) The Currency being taxed;
        (2) the amount of the levy, expressed as a percentage;
        (3) any exemptions from the levy; and
        (4) the legal authorization for the levy.

      (d) As soon as possible after the announcement of a tax levy
          conforming with subdivision (c) of this Rule, the
          Recordkeepor of the Currency in which the tax is levied
          shall compute the amount of tax owed by each taxable entity,
          and issue Payment Orders requiring each such entity to pay
          eir tax to the Bank.

      (e) The amount of tax levied on a taxable entity is the
          announced percentage of that entity's holdings of the
          Currency being taxed, using the amount of that Currency
          owned by that entity at the time the announcement was made,
          and shall exclude any amount which the legal authorization
          of that specific tax levy allows to be excluded from
          taxation.

      (f) Subdivision (e) of this Rule notwithstanding, the amount of
          tax levied on a particular entity may not exceed fifty
          percent of that entity's holdings unless the legal
          authorization of the specific tax levy explicitly permits
          it.

      (g) The Bank is not a taxable entity.  All other entities are.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1852 be repealed.

[ This changes taxes to be real taxes: now, they are used by the
  Chancellor to raise revenue so as to be able to pay the Bank's
  debts. The exemption language allows the Chancellor to tax 50% of VT
  holdings above 5 VT, or 20% of VT holdings above 4 VTs for Players
  or 2 VTs for non-Players, but not above 4 VTs for Players or 6 VTs
  for non-Players.

  In order to encourage Chancellors to adopt sound fiscal policy, the
  power to mint Currencies is curtailed to "Without Objection"; a
  Chancellor who fails to ensure that e has enough funds in the
  Treasury will face Persistent Indebtedness penalties. ]
