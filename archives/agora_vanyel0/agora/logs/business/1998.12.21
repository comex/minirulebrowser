Here's something a bit odd. Note the date stamp on the message below.

> From: "Laurent Bossavit" <laurent@netdive.com>
> To: agora-official@gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au
> Date: Mon, 21 Dec 1998 08:32:58 +0200
> Subject: OFF: Bank Transaction Notices
> 
> Agora Chancellor's Office

> 
> Acting, as pro tem Chancellor, on behalf of the Bank, I hereby

Now look at the date stamp on the Assessor's Report containing these POs:

> From: malcolmr@cse.unsw.edu.au (Malcolm Ross Kinsella Ryan)
> To: agora-official@gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au (Nomic Official)

> apn020  Bank           Steve        2  P-Notes   R833, P3812

According to the stamps, Morendil paid the POs half an hour before 
I issued them!
