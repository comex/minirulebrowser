I think I agree with Scott, at least in this instance.  The operation
of the Proposal Queue should provide a natural competition among
Proposals leading to an expenditure of P-Notes related to the
P-Notes in circulation.  Particularly with a small batch size.
I think with the current system, as long as there is a competition
between Proposals to get distributed, it doesn't matter much if
there's a few dozen P-Notes in circulation or a few thousand--the
economy should naturally reach a balance.

If we don't have a balance now, it's because there *isn't* competition
between Proposals to be distributed.  I can't speak for anyone else,
but I know I haven't been making Proposals lately simply due to a lack of
time--not due to any in-game factors.  If this is the case among
many of the Players, I don't know if anything can fix it--but
I certainly don't think that further reducing the P-Note supply
will encourage more Proposals.

I will, however, do what I can to encourage the expenditure of
P-Notes:

H. Promotor, I hereby transfer 1 P-Note to the Bank in order
to reduce the Priority of "The P-Note Tap" by 1.
