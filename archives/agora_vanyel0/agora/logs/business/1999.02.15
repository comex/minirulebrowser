I hereby pay one P-Note to raise the Priority of my Proposal 'Vlad the

The Threat has been moribund for some time. But on this issue, you seem
to have had elJefe's support, so insofar as the Group had a view, it
would seem to be have been yours by a 2-1 majority.

This message contains the protoposal  "Power to the Senate"

I wonder if people would be happy to give more power to the senate?  The 
original idea was to give the Senate more power and so create stability.  
However, it looks like there might be a big punch up though.  Which 
would be fun, I think.

There are a couple of little changes, and organisational points.  The 
two main points added are that ANY Senator may make a proposal into a 
Senate proposal, and Senators can be removed from the Senate.  This 
could give the Senate a huge amount of power, but as long as there at 
least two "nice" Senators it should be fine.  Hopefully this might be a 
more useful idea than my last couple.  (I think they are getting better 
though).


Also added the idea of a Senate Suggestion.


This is the Protoposal   "Power to the Senate."

Amend rule 1717 to read

The Senate

There exist Nomic entities know as Senators, there also exists a Nomic 
entity known as the Senate.  The Senate is the collective of all the 
Senators.  Only Senators are members of the Senate.

A Player may only become a Senator as defined by the rules.  A Player 
may only cease to be a Senator as defined by the rules.  Any Senator 
that is not a Player ceases to be a Senator.  If a Senator is removed 
from the Senate, e ceases to be a Senator.  

A Player who has been registered continuously for the immediately 
preceding two months becomes a Senator, if and only if e has not been a 
Senator at any point during those two months.

There are always at least three Senators.  If at any point there is less 
than three Senators, the registered player, who is not a Senator, and 
who has not been a Senator for the longest period of time amongst the 
registered players, becomes a Senator.

Any Senator may choose to remove themselves from the Senate, by stating 
so in a public forum.




Create a new rule with the following text:

Senator Suggestions

A Senate Suggestion a is a piece of text sent to a public forum by a 
Senator.  It must state clearly that it is a Senate Suggestion and 
contain a valid Suggestion, or it fails to be a Senate Suggestion.

Only Senators may make Senate Suggestions.  Senate Suggestions may be 
made only as defined by the rules.  A Senate must contain all the 
information needed, as defined by the rules, or it fails to be a Senate 
Suggestion.

Any Senator may object to a Senate Suggestion, by stating so in a public 
forum.  Making clear the suggestion they object to.



Create a new rule with the following text:

Senate Powers

A Senator may make a Senate Suggestion, that a registered player becomes 
a Senator.  To do so there must be a clear indication of the intended 
player in the Suggestion.  The player becomes a Senator one week after 
the suggestion, unless a Senator objects to the suggestion within the 
week.

A Senator may make a Senate Suggestion, that a Senator is removed from 
the Senate.  To do so there must be a clear indication of the intended 
Senator in the Suggestion. The Senator is removed from the Senate one 
week after the suggestion, unless a Senator, excluding the Senator in 
question, objects to the suggestion within the week.




Create a rule with the following text:

Senate Proposals

At any time during a Proposal's Voting Period, a Senator may make it a 
Senate Proposal, by stating so in the Public Forum.  If that does not 
happen, the Proposal is not a Senate Proposal.  

A Senator may object to the proposal becoming a Senate Proposal by 
stating so in the public forum during the Proposal’s Voting Period, in 
which case the proposal ceases to be a Senate Proposal, and returns to 
its previous state.

If a Senator objects to a proposal Senate Proposal, that Proposal may 
not become a Senate proposal again.

Entities other than Senators cannot Vote on Senate Proposals. If an 
Entity other than a Senator has already voted on a Proposal by the time 
it becomes a Senate Proposal, eir votes on that Proposal are cancelled, 
these votes remain canceled even if the Proposal reverts from being a 
Senate Proposal.



I think I might actually propose this. (as if it manages to get passed I 
get a pile of VTs)  So ideas and suggestions would be very welcome.  

Peekee

This message contains exactly one Proposal.  The Proposal begins
immediately after the line marked "**START PROPOSAL" and ends at the
end of the message.
  
The following Proposal is to be titled "Freshen 1796" and is to have
Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
| Be it resolved, that Rule 1796 be amended to read:

      (a) All Orders executed in the manner prescribed by the Rules
          for their class and type are presumed valid and enforceable.

      (b) In order for a Judge to find an Order invalid, the Judge
          must find that:
        (1) the Order was executed by a Player who the Rules did not
            permit to execute it;
        (2) the Order was executed in circumstances that neither
            required not permitted the execution of that Order; or
        (3) the Order has been rendered invalid by another Order or by
            the Rules.

      (c) A Judge who finds, during the course of judging a CFJ, that
          an Order is invalid shall vacate that Order, unless it has
          already been vacated.

      (d) Nothing in any Order shall act to prevent or hinder judicial
          review of that Order, and any portion of an Order which has
          this effect is void and without force, all other Rules
          notwithstanding.
