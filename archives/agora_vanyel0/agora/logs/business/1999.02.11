I hereby execute the following application (between dashed
lines):

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an Application to create an Organization.  The
Organization to be created is a Contest, named "Chuck's
Second Savings and Loan Contest".

Its Regulations are as follows:

1.  The name of this Contest is "Chuck's Second Savings and Loan
    Contest".

2.  The Contestmaster is Chuck.  The Contestmaster shall not
    change.

3.  Changes to these Regulations may be made by unanimous consent of
    the Contestmaster and all Contestants.  However, such changes
    must be announced in the Public Forum to be effective, and
    only take effect 14 days after such changes are announced.
    These Regulations shall not be changed except as described
    here.

4.  When an entity transfers an amount of Currency to this
    Contest, the Contestmaster shall transfer the same amount
    of that Currency back to the entity as soon as possible
    after seven days have passed from the initial transfer,
    subject to the exceptions below.

5.  If this Contest is subject to a Tax on a given Currency,
    the amount to be distributed to entities which had transferred
    that Currency to this Contest, but had not yet been paid
    back, at the time at which the Tax was imposed, shall be
    reduced by a percentage equal to the percentage of the
    tax.  This regulation alters only the amount of Currency
    paid, not the timing.

6.  If an entity which had transferred Currency to this Contest
    ceases to exist before the Currency is transferred back, the
    Currency shall be transferred to the Bank instead.  This
    regulation alters only the recipient of the Currency, not
    the timing.

7.  If the entity transferring Currency to the Contest specifies,
    to the Contestmaster, a different amount of time than the
    seven days specified in Regulation 4, than the Currency
    shall be paid back to that entity as soon as possible after
    the specified length of time has passed after the initial
    transfer.  However, to be effective, such specification of
    time must take place no later than the transfer of Currency.

8.  Currency may not be disbursed from this Contest except as
    required by these Regulations or by the Rules.

9.  Should Chuck's Second Savings and Loan Contest be dissolved,
    the Currencies belonging to it shall be distributed to those
    entities to which they would eventually be paid as per the
    Contest's Regulations, with the exception that those which
    would be distributed to the Player who was Contestmaster
    immediately prior to the dissolution are transferred to
    the Bank instead.

10. As soon as possible after the creation of this Contest,
    the Contestmaster shall take those actions necessary to
    create a Will for this Contest, with the text of Regulation
    9 as the Will's text.  Once created, the Will shall not
    be changed.

Signature: Chuck
