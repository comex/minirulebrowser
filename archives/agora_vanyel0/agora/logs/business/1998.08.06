Michael, please don't take this personally, but I've got a bit of a
thing at the moment about enforcing the Crimes and Infractions Rules,
so:

I hereby report that Michael has committed the Infraction of Tardiness,
in that he took longer than a week to distribute the Motion I included
with my submission of CFJ 1567 to Judge Kolja, thus violating the asap
requirement in R1826.

Indulgences to the Bank.
