I'm not aware of any precedents. But here's how I'd reason about the
problem. As far as I know, there's no law against issuing Payment
Orders for an amount of Currency less than the Currency's MUQ. So, I
can issue a PO ordering Macross to pay 0.5 Indulgences to the Bank.
However, R1577 says that all *transfers* of Currency shall be rounded
to the nearest multiple of the MUQ. So what would happen if Macross
attempted to satisfy this PO by transferring 0.5 Indulgences to the
Bank?  Would this transfer be rounded up or down? I'd argue that it
would be rounded up to 1 Indulgence, for two reasons. Firstly, we
have Oerjan's recent Judgement confirming that it is impossible to
transfer 0 units of a Currency. Secondly, even if it were possible
to transfer 0 units of a Currency, a transfer of 0 Indulgences would
not satisfy the PO, whereas a transfer of 1 Indulgence would. 

With all that in mind, I hereby vacate the Payment Orders for 1 VT
and 1 Indulgence naming Macross as the Payor and the Bank as the
Payee which I made the other day in order to penalize Macross for
committing the Infraction of Public Voting, and issue two new Payment
Orders naming Macross as the Payor and the Bank as the Payee, for
the amounts of 0.5 VTs and 0.5 Indulgences respectively.
