Sheesh, I can't even follow my own determinations.  I announced
that the first 11 applications of the Frankenstein Mutator
only enacted one Rule Change each, and then I go ahead and
count them as two anyway.

The most-recently posted Short Logical Ruleset is in error, in
that the amendment number of Rule 1671 is listed as 103, when
in fact it is 92.  The relevant portion should read:

Rule 1671/92 (Power=1)
The Frankenstein Rule


On another note, I announced near the beginning of November
that I was delaying the FLR until I could make some unofficial
annotations based on some past Judgements I've saved.  Unfortunately,
I haven't had time to, so the FLR (without additional annotations)
follows shortly.  I'll try to add them in December.

ProtoProposal
Organizational Payment Orders

Create a Rule "Organizational Payment Orders" which reads:

     The Executor of Organization's SLC is empowered to execute Payment Orders
     from the Organization or from any Player within its Jurisdiction, but only
     such Payment Orders as are authorized by the SLC.

*********************************

Comment:  The ability of Contests and Groups (old Rule 1534) to make
currency transfers from their contestants/members disappeared with
Pragmatic Currencies. Instead we merely have the SLC's power to require
Players to transfer currencies, which anyone can avoid by simply resigning
from the Contest or Group.  This proto restores the ability to make the
transfers happen regardless.

Regards,
