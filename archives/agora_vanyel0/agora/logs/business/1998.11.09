BUS: My quitness/silence/abandonment/etc 

Welcome back Proglet!  Glad you could rejoin.  Unfortunately, my duties as
Herald require me to present you with the following welcome back gift.  8(

Since Proglet had 1 Fugitive Blot, per Rule 1437, I hereby order Proglet
to pay one (1) Indulgence to the Bank.  Proglet's Fugitive Blot is hereby
removed.

Due to recent workload, my life has been having some downtime lately. 
Nontheless, I'm now back to read a thousand nomic messages.

>I hereby cause Proglet to become Quiet. 
>Proglet? Are you there? Say something to us in the PF...

ok, I'm here now.

>BUS: Proglet Abandons the Game

whoops, looks like I was a little too quiet for a little too long...

As it is now November, and that was October, I believe that I am 
now eligible to reregister by requesting so to a public forum.

I hereby request reregistration.

(In the meantime, I'll keep on punching through that email!)

thanks,
proglet

Michael,

I'm afraid the first two of these transfers failed for lack of funds.  You
currently have no Indulgences.

Proto: Fix Promotor's Duties

[Comment: There is no need to make the R-O-M selections and the
 Public Service selections "as soon as possible" obligations. There
 is no urgency in these actions, and if they are not done during
 a week, there is not real need to do them twice the next week.
 So, I propose to remove the ASAP clauses.

 While I'm at it, I have removed the requirement to put the Public
 Service list in the Promotor's Report. It is a separate issue and
 should be published separately.]

Amend Rule 1753 (Repeal-O-Matic) by replacing the text:

      The Promotor shall select five different Rules, 

with: 

      Each week, the Promotor shall select five different Rules, 

and deleting the text:

      The Promotor shall make these selections as soon as possible
      after the beginning of the Nomic Week.

---

Amend the Rule "A Duty to Propose" by replacing the text:

      The Promotor shall include this list in eir Promotor's Report.

with:

      The Promotor shall publish this list each Week.

and the text:

      As soon as possible after the beginning of each Week, 

with:

      Each Week,

Judge Harlequin's week to deliver Judgement on CFJ 1109 has expired, and
he has not responded to my queries. I therefore report that Harlequin
has committed the Infraction of Judging Late, the penalty for which is 3
Blots.

A new Judge will be assigned shortly.

CotC Steve
