While it appears that Morendil did legally hold the Office of
Speaker-Elect, he did not do so in the normal fashion.  Since he was
not a Player at the time that he held the Office, he was not an
Officer, as Officers are defined by Rule 1006 as being Players.
Since, during Morendil's tenure in the Office, the Office of
Speaker-Elect was not being held by an Officer who had been elected to
that Office, it was not being held in the normal fashion.  As a
consequence, Morendil ascends to the Speakership Tainted, and the
winner of the upcoming Speaker-Elect election will immediately replace
Morendil as Speaker.  Morendil is further barred from exercising the
Speaker's privileges of the Speaker's Vote, of calling Elections, or
of Patronage.

There is also the issue of the 34 Fugitive Blots that Morendil
presently has.  As soon as the Herald applies those Blots, Morendil
will once again be subject to deregistration for Lawlessness.

Not quite true. Rule 1006 states that "an Office is a position [...]
held by a Player, who is called an Officer". It is precisely this
provision which was overruled by Rule 790, with higher precedence,
giving rise to a situation where an Office was *not* held by a
Player. Given this assessment, it is at the very least suspect to
read that provision as implying that a non-Player may not be an
Officer. Further, all that provision really mandates is that a Player 
who holds an Office is an Officer; there is no implication that the 
term 'Officer' may not apply to a broader category.

Rather, I would construe the Rules in general, and Rules 790 and
1006 in particular, as implying that a person who holds an Office is 
an Officer, this being both the natural meaning of the term and 
consistent with past usage.

I believe this issue is currently in the Courts anyway... It seems 
rather unfair of Scott to prejudge an issue that is currently being 
considered.

Which, fortunately, recent Judicial decision states must be done by
an explicit declaration to the PF. But other considerations
complicate the situation. One is that I may be a Player, but I did
not become one by registering (or reregistering). It is therefore
dubious that I can be meaningfully 'deregistered' - not to mention
that Rule 1437 does not apply to me anyway, so the Herald has no
cause to transform my Fugitive Blots into real Blots.

In any case, I hereby submit the following Disinterested Proposal :

Finish Amnesty
----------
  Enact a Rule with the following text :

      Upon the creation of this Rule, all persons with Fugitive Blots
      shall have all Fugitive Blots removed from them. Further, the
      Herald shall vacate all due Payment Orders for Indulgences 
      which have been executed under the authority of Rule 1473.
      Immediately after e has done so, this Rule repeals itself.

Blot Amnesty Extension

All former Players who have Fugitive Blots have their number of Fugitive
Blots decreased to zero.

I would like to remind the Herald that by Rule 1599, he is required to
re-execute all those Payment Orders, as if he had never executed them.

Sheesh, and we even discussed it in advance.

I hereby judge the statement of CFJ 1065,

  "I (the caller of this CFJ) am my own Executor.",

to be false.

Reasons and arguments:

We are dealing with an interesting question of (real and potential)
conflicts and various precedence regulations here. The rules concerned
are 1738 and 1478 (see evidence below).

1. By rule number, 1478 takes precedence in case of a conflict.

2. 1738 states "This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which
would specify a different Executor for an entity in Probate." This
precedence is based on a condition: it only applies to other rules
that try to specify executors for an entity in probate. However, if
this condition is met, the _whole_ rule 1738 has precedence over the
other rule, not only the paragraph of 1738 that allows the notary to
assign executors in probate.

3. 1478 states "Except when the Rules stipulate otherwise, a Player is
eir own Executor." This explicitly defers to rules that define a
player's executor to be someone else than the player emself. However,
this precedence clause only concerns the one question of who is
executor, not the rule 1478 as a whole.


Swann has been assigned an executor in probate. Thus, 1738 "stipulates
otherwise" than the default given in 1478 would; 1478 defers to the
regulations of 1738, and Swann's executor in Probate is still eir
executor. The statement of this CFJ is thus false.


There remains the interesting question of what powers this executor in
probate has. I mention this point here, because one _might_ argue as
follows:

-- 
1478 states

      The Executor of an entity is a Player who is empowered by the
      Rules to act on behalf of that entity, as if e was that entity.
                                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
while 1738 limits the powers of an executor in Probate significantly:

      The Executor in Probate of an entity is the Executor of that
      entity, and empowered only to submit Transfers Orders for that
      entity.     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are other things the EiP can do, but clearly 1738 allows less
than 1478. Reading the sentence quoted from 1478 as a _definition_ of
"Executor", the EiP described in 1738 (who has smaller powers) cannot
be the player's executor.
-- 

However, I argue that the above argument (between the dashes, --) is
false. The sentence quoted from 1478 is not a _definition_ of
"Executor", but an assignment of certain powers to the executor. This
assignment does conflict with the, much more restricted, assignment of 
1738. 

We have seen above that 1478 does not define a different executor as
1738, so the precedence clause "This Rule takes precedence over any
other Rule which would specify a different Executor for an entity in
Probate." from 1738 does _not_ trigger, and the conflicting
assignments of power to the executor are resolved in favor of the
lower numbered rule, 1478. 

So an analysis of the argument enclosed in dashes (--) does not only
show that this argument is false (this is why I'm talking about the
issue in this Judgement), it also shows that the executor in probate
does have the large powers given to executors in 1478. The latter
point is not strictly relevant for this CFJ, but does confirm the way
we've handled the situation so far.

Evidence:

---
Rule 1738/0 (Power=1)
Executors in Probate

      Whenever there is an entity in Probate which does not have an
      Executor in Probate, the Notary shall nominate a Player to be
      that entity's Executor in Probate.  E shall announce this
      appointment in the Public Forum.

      The Executor in Probate of an entity is the Executor of that
      entity, and empowered only to submit Transfers Orders for that
      entity.  An Executor in Probate also has the power to execute
      and vacate certain Payment Orders, as specified by the Probate
      Code.  This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which
      would specify a different Executor for an entity in Probate.

      The Executor in Probate of an entity shall, upon eir nomination,
      arrange for the disposal of that entity's assets and debts,
      according to the procedures specified in the Probate Code, and
      shall do so in a timely manner.

      The Executor in Probate of an entity ceases to be its Executor
      in Probate when e announces, in accordance with the Probate
      Code, that the entity is no longer in Probate, or when e
      announces that e resigns as that entity's Executor in Probate.

      The Notary shall keep a record of each entity in Probate, and
      the Executor in Probate of each entity in Probate.

---
Rule 1478/2 (Power=1)
Executors

      The Executor of an entity is a Player who is empowered by the
      Rules to act on behalf of that entity, as if e was that entity.

      Except when the Rules stipulate otherwise, a Player is eir own
      Executor.  Any other entity has an Executor only when the Rules
      specify either a Player or a means to designate a Player to be
      the Executor of that entity.

      Whenever a Player is acting on behalf of some entity of which e
      is the Executor other than emself, e must make it clear that e
      is doing so.  If such a Player fails to clearly indicate that e
      is acting as the Executor of some other entity, it shall be
      presumed that e is acting on eir own behalf.

      A Nomic Entity (other than a person who is not a Player) which
      has no Executor, or whose Executor is not a Player, may not
      perform any action except when required to do so by the Rules.

I hereby call for judgement on the following statement, barring Chuck:

The sentence "If this leads to a Voting Period that is shorter than
three days, the Voting Period shall instead last for three days or
until two days before the InterNomic Voting Period on the relevant
InterNomic Proposal is over, whichever is earliest." has been added to
the third paragraph of R1632.


Reasons and arguments:

The rulekeepor's argument is quoted in the evidence. 

I disagree with this argument for two reasons:

- While I admit that the verb "append" would have been clearer than
the verb "add" it still is obvious to me (as a non-native speaker, of
course) that the proposal is to append the given sentence to the third
paragraph of 1632.

I therefore would like to apply 754 (as "dialect", maybe? It's not a
typo, of course) to clarify the meaning of P3575.


- I think that to call this provision ambiguous is hairsplitting at
best. While this may be considered in keeping with the spirit of Nomic
by some, I consider it a superfluous complication in this case.

Grammatically, the only sensible position for the new sentence is at
the end of the third paragraph of 1632. However, except for a weird
wording, no consequences would arise from adding the sentence at the
beginning of the paragraph. Adding it elswhere would just be nonsense. 

I do not consider the rulekeepor a mindless word processor. E is not
told how to indent the rules, either; nor are there provisions for the
form and details of annotations. In fact, even the division of rules
into paragrpahs is not mandated anywhere in the rules. So game custom
also does treat the rulekeepor not as a word processor, but as a human
player who can understand what e is doing and interpret proposals like
3575 as human language with a meaning. This is why the rulekeepor is
an officer and not a perl script, after all. While I admit that a
computer program could find P3575 ambiguous, a human shouldn't.

Kolja A.

P.S. Of course, I hope strongly that noone will feel offended by my
arguments, especially Chuck. Certainly this is not my intention. I
consider this more a question of game custom and the spirit of the
game, but wanted to resolve it formally, too, and not delay this CFJ
until the end of a lengthy discussion on a-d. I would welcome
contributions to such a discussion from everyone interested, though. 


Evidence:

1. Proposal 3575:

======================================================================
Proposal 3575 (Kolja A.)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Fix Internomic referenda

Amend 1632 by adding the following sentence to the third paragraph
(Duration of Voting):

If this leads to a Voting Period that is shorter than three days, the
Voting Period shall instead last for three days or until two days
before the InterNomic Voting Period on the relevant InterNomic
Proposal is over, whichever is earliest.
---

[Note that, if this still does not lead to a voting period of a
positive length, the Ambassador has clearly failed to distribute the
proposal ASAP, according to 1632.]

======================================================================


2. Parts of the message announcing the adoption of P3575:

>>
			     AGORA NOMIC
			OFFICE OF THE ASSESSOR
			   OCTOBER 30, 1997

		    Results of Proposals 3569-3576
======================================================================

Voting for 3569-3575 commenced: Mon Oct 20 14:30:58 1997
Voting for 3569-3575 concluded: Thu Oct 30 14:30:58 1997

At the commencement of the Voting Periods of Proposals 3569-3575 there
were 18 Registered Players: 18 Active, 0 On Hold.  Therefore the
Quorum for these Proposals is 9 (Rule 879/5).

It doesn't say where in the third paragraph the sentence is
to be added.

Did I miss a message somewhere?  I don't remember seeing any P-Notes being
minted.  Unless the good Chancellor can give me some evidence of minted
P-Notes, I have to inform em and the named recipients that all of the above
mentioned Transfer Orders failed due to lack of funds.

Hmm.  Looks like I need to share in that Hot Toddy with the Chancellor.  Well,
consider this the true call for Appeal of CFJ 1063.

Sheesh, you're right, I forgot all about that.  Damn!  This was not
intentional, but it seems I had better make a COE to prevent conditions for
repeal of R1743 from being met.  So here goes:

--------------------
This is a Claim of Error on the reporting of PI Infractions made by the Herald
persuant to Rule 1743.  The errors are as follows:

Week of 10/6:  PI Infractions incorrectly reported against Morendil and Elde. 
These should have been reported against Elde and Blob, respectively.

Week of 10/13:  Same as week of 10/6.

Week of 10/20:  Same as week of 10/6.
--------------------

As of this moment then, there are six unreported PI Infractions, therefore the
conditions for repeal of R1743 have not been met.

I now reissue the following Payment Orders as per R1599:

PO#     Date                     Amount   Payor        Payee        Executor

A number of changes due to a few comments I've gotten.
All the complicated stuff dealing with Equivelance, Convertability
and Decimal Objects are removed, so I think I can
safly say that this will simplify matters rather
than making them more complicated.

This is still officially in the pre-Proto stages.  There's still
a few things that need to be added to make this work (such as eliminating
fractional VTs from the Ruleset, and bootstraping whatever Currencies
that we'd wish to carry over.)  But this is getting close to
a final version.
=========================================================================
PROTO: Objects



============================================================
PART I: Objects in General

The Rule Category "Currencies" is re-named "Objects"

Rule 1467 has its title change from "Definition of a Currency"
to "Definition of an Object"

Amend Rule 1467 (Definition of a Currency) to read as follows;

     There are entities known as Objects.  An entity is only an 
     Object if the Rules designate it as such.  All Objects, and all
     Classes of Objects conform to the following strictures:

       i) All individual Objects must be a member of one, and only one, 
          Class of Objects explicitly defined in the Rules.
      ii) All individual Objects are owned by one, and only one, entity. 
          Whenever the owner of an individual Object is otherwise
          unspecified, its owner is the Bank.
     iii) All Objects are indivisible. Entities may only own an integral 
          number of Objects.
      iv) An Object that is a member of Class X may be referred to as an
          X. (Where X is the name of the Class of Object.)
       v) Each Class of Objects has a Recordkeepor who must keep a
          current Record of all entities that own Objects belonging to 
          that Class, and the number of those Objects each entity 
          possesses.  If the Rules specify no other Recordkeepor for a
          Class of Objects, that Recordkeepor is the Chancellor.

     This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule defining the 
     properties of Objects or Classes of Objects.

{Comment: This begins a general pragmatic infrastructure to replace the
          current currency bureaucracy.  Currencies are to be replaced
          by Objects, with a much more general structure.
          v0.2 followed some suggestions about language.}


Rule 1576 has its title change from "Names of Currencies" to
"Classes of Objects"

Rule 1576 (Names of Currencies) is amended to read as follows;

     Each Class of Object shall have a name, which must be distinct
     from the name of any other Class of Object.

     Any attempt to create a Class of Object with the same name as an
     already existing Class of Object fails.

     Classes of Objects can only be created by the Rules or by 
     procedure explicitly defined in the Rules.

{Comment: v0.2, added a restriction on the creation of Classes of
          Objects.}

Rule 1577 (Minimum Unit Quantities (MUQ)) is repealed.
{Comment: Objects are atomic entities.}


Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Legal State and Actual State of Objects}

     Every Object has a "Legal State" and an "Actual State."

     The Actual State of an Object is the state of that Object as 
     recorded by that Object's Recordkeepor.  The Actual State of an 
     Object may only be changed by the Object's Recordkeepor. The Actual 
     State of an Object may never be changed retroactively.

     The Legal State of an Object, is the state of that Object as it 
     would have been Recorded given adherence to the Rules, perfect 
     knowledge, and absence of error.

     Whenever the Recordkeepor discovers that the Actual State of an 
     Object is not the same as the Legal State of an Object, e is 
     required to alter the Actual state of Objects (Creating, 
     Destroying, and Transferring Objects as needed) to conform the 
     current Actual State of that Objects to the current Legal State of 
     that Object.  This change only applies at the time the change takes 
     place, and does not alter any prior states of that Object, even if 
     those states were not the same as the Legal State of that Object at 
     the time.

     Whenever the Rules refer to the owner of an Object, it means the 
     Actual Owner of that Object.

     This rule takes precedence over any Rule that contradicts its 
     provisions.

     Any changes to an Object's State required by this Rule are detected 
     and Reported by the Recordkeepor in question.

{Comment: v0.2 This rule is needed since a few people seemed confused as 
          to the purpouse of the Legal and Actual state of Objects.  I 
          guess I needed to state explicitly that the Actual State is 
          _it_, if the Recordkeepor says you have a VT, you have a VT, 
          and a future CFJ can't say otherwise. (It can say you weren't
          suposed to have the VT, and the Recordkeepor may transfer it
          back, but that's different than an indeterminate gamestate.)}


Rule 1578 (Currency Recordkeepors) has its title change from
"Currency Recordkeepors" to "Object Records"


Rule 1578 (Currency Recordkeepors) is amended to read as follows;

     Every Recordkeepor of a given Class of Objects must, once a week, 
     publish a report that contains a list of all entities that own 
     Objects belonging to that Class, and the number of those Objects 
     each entity possesses. This record of ownership is known as the 
     "Actual State" of those Objects; entities only own Objects as 
     recorded by the Recordkeepor, and Objects exist only in those 
     numbers recorded by the Recordkeepor.

     There is also the "Legal State" of those Objects, which is the 
     record of ownership and number that reflects what the Recordkeepor
     would have recorded given adherence to the Rules, perfect
     knowledge, and absence of error.

     Within the Class of Objects e records, the Recordkeepor must record 
     every change in ownership or number of Objects that is mandated in 
     the Rules, and e must refrain from recording any change in 
     ownership or number of Objects that is not mandated in the Rules.  
     Willful disregard of this provision is an "Abuse of 
     Responsibility," a Crime defined in other Rules.

     If any Player believes that the Recordkeepor has produced a report 
     that states an Actual State for an Object (or set of Objects) which 
     is not also the Legal State for that Object (or set of Objects), e 
     may produce a Claim of Error alleging this.

     Whenever a CFJ (or an admitted COE) finds that at some point the 
     Actual State of an Object (or set of Objects) was not also the 
     Legal State of that Object (or set of Objects) the Recordkeepor for 
     that Object (or set of Objects) must adjust eir records so that the 
     current Actual State of those Objects conforms to the current Legal
     State of those Objects as specified in the CFJ (or admitted COE).
     This shall never alter any past Actual states of those Objects.

     Object Records can be Ratified. The effect of such Ratification is 
     to change the Legal State of the recorded Objects to conform to the 
     Actual State of those Objects.

{Comment: This is the heart of the pragmatic nature of this proposal.
          Like "ratification" this Rule makes a distinct effort to 
          separate what the Game State is, and what our Reports record.  
          This however goes further by creating a "Legal State" distinct 
          from the "Actual State," this is meant to be an analogue, as 
          closely as possible, to our officers moving physical tokens 
          around-- if the officer makes a mistake and gives someone an 
          Object, the Object is actually given, there is no chance for a 
          game state being indeterminate.  The gamestate's what the 
          reports say, period.  The "Legal State" exists to allow the 
          correction of errors, it exists as a model of what the 
          gamestate should be.}


Create a Rule with the following text;
{Title: When the Recordkeepor is not a Player}

      If the designated Recordkeepor of a Class of Objects ceases to be
      a Player, and other Rules do not define a procedure for selecting
      a new Recordkeepor, the Speaker shall as soon as possible
      designate a willing player as the new Recordkeepor for that Class 
      of Objects.

      Until a new Recordkeepor is designated, the Speaker shall fulfill
      that responsibility.

{Comment: Part of the old version of the prior rule that no longer
          seemed to fit there.
          v0.2 followed elJefe's suggestion.}


Rule 1579 (Mintors) is repealed.
Rule 1722 (Minting of Currencies) is repealed.
Rule 1471 (Creation and Destruction of Currencies) is repealed.

{Comment: Mintors and Mint Authority are actually a hindrance to this
          reform, in that they add additional conditions to the legal 
          status of moves, and actually increase the bureaucratic 
          minutiae required to perform some basic actions, like 
          Converting an Object.  It also prevents the Object scheme from 
          addressing our "non-currency" Objects like Blots and Kudos.}


Create a Rule with the following text;
{Title: Legal Changes to Objects}

     To have effect, whenever the Rules specify a Transfer, a Creation, 
     or Destruction, of an Object, they must also specify a Player who 
     is to send a message to that Object's Recordkeepor to notify em of 
     the change.  The change only happens if the following conditions 
     hold.

       i) The Rules mandate the change.
      ii) The Rules specify a Player to report the change to the 
          Recordkeepor.
     iii) The specified Player reports the change to the Recordkeepor.

     If all these conditions hold, then the change reported by the 
     Player becomes the Legal State of that Object.

{Comment: Note that this specifies the requirements to change the "Legal
          State" of an object. (see: Object Records)  Note that if the 
          above rule invalidates a move, and we discover it much later, 
          there's still no gamestate indeterminance, at worst the 
          Recordkeepor will have to revise eir records to conform the 
          Object Records to the Legal State of the game, but this would
          not invalidate any moves subsequent to the error.}


Rule 1721 (The Chancellor) is amended to read as follows;

      There shall exist the Office of Chancellor.

      The Chancellor shall retain a schedule, listing every Class of
      Object, its Name and its Recordkeepor. This schedule shall be
      posted to the Public Forum by the Chancellor at least once in
      each Month.

{Comment: MUQ's and Mintors no longer exist.}


Rule 1599 (Failure to Execute Payment Orders) is repealed
Rule 1598 (Transfer Orders) is repealed
Rule 1730 (Delayed Transfer Orders) is repealed
Rule 1731 (Implicit Transfer Orders) is repealed
Rule 1596 (Payment Orders) is repealed
Rule 1732 (Satisfaction of Payment Orders) is repealed
Rule 1733 (Disputed Payment Orders) is repealed
Rule 1734 (Vacated Payment Orders) is repealed

{Comment: This repeals the Transfer Order/Payment Order bureaucracy,
          cutting down immensely on the paperwork required for simple
          actions.}

Create a Rule with the following text;
{Title: Transferring Objects}

     When an Object is Transferred it ceases to be owned by one entity, 
     and simultaneously becomes owned by another entity.

     An Object is Legally Transferred when the Player designated by the 
     Rules to report the Transfer, reports the Transfer, the original
     owner of the Object, and the new owner of the Object, to that
     Object's Recordkeepor.  At this point the transfer is part of the
     Legal State of that Object.

     An Object is Actually Transferred when the Recordkeepor for that 
     Object records the change in ownership for that Object.  At this 
     point the change becomes part of the Actual State of that Object.

     The Recordkeepor must match every Legal Transfer with a 
     corresponding Actual Transfer.

     If a Recordkeepor commits the willful initiation of Actual 
     Transfers that correspond to no Legal Transfers, e is guilty of the 
     Crime of "Abuse of Responsibility" as defined in other Rules.

{Comment: The language here mirrors the language in Object Reports.
          Yes, theoretically the Recordkeepor could make all sorts
          of real transfers, but that is a criminalized act.  This,
          IMHO, is how "pragmatic" recordkeeping should be handled,
          W/O a mountain of paperwork.}


Create a Rule with the following text;
{Title: Creation or Destruction of Objects}

     When an Object is Created it comes into existence owned by a 
     specific entity.  When an Object is Destroyed, some specific entity 
     with at least one of those Objects has one of those Objects cease 
     to exist.

     An Object is Legally Created when the Player designated by the 
     Rules to report the Creation, reports the Creation, and the owner 
     of the Created Object, to that Object's Recordkeepor.  At this 
     point the Creation is part of the Legal State of that Object.

     An Object is Legally Destroyed when the Player designated by the 
     Rules to report the Destruction, reports the Destruction, and the 
     owner of the Destroyed Object, to that Object's Recordkeepor.  At 
     this point the Destruction is part of the Legal State of that 
     Object.

     An Object is Actually Created or Destroyed when the Recordkeepor 
     for that Object records the change for that Object.  At this point 
     the change becomes part of the Actual State of that Object.

     The Recordkeepor must match every Legal Creation with a 
     corresponding Actual Creation.

     The Recordkeepor must match every Legal Destruction with a 
     corresponding Actual Destruction.

     If a Recordkeepor commits the willful initiation of Actual 
     changes (Creations or Destructions) that correspond to no Legal
     changes, e is guilty of the Crime of "Abuse of Responsibility" as
     defined in other Rules.

{Comment: See comment above}


Rule 1713 (Debt) is amended to read as follows;

     Whenever the Rules require that Objects be Transferred from an 
     entity, or that Objects possessed by an entity are to be 
     Destroyed, and upon the report of this Legal Transfer or Legal 
     Destruction, the entity possesses fewer Objects of the type
     specified then are required to be Transferred or Destroyed, 
     the Recordkeepor of that Object shall do the following before e
     makes the required Actual Transfers or Destructions:

     E shall Create, in the entity's possession, a number of the 
     specified Objects so the entity possesses exactly the amount of the 
     specified Objects required to be Transferred or Destroyed.  E shall 
     then create in that entity's possession an amount of Blots 
     equivalent to the number of Objects e Created.  (If this value is 
     elsewhere undefined, the equivalent number of Blots shall be the 
     number of Objects created, divided by two, rounded up to the next
     highest integer.)  This value shall always be at least one Blot.
     This Rule takes precedence over Rules that specify an equivalent
     value of less than one Blot.

     The Recordkeepor for the Object in question is charged with 
     reporting these changes to the appropriate Recordkeepors.

{Comment: There is no such thing as Persistent Indebtedness anymore.  If
          you go into debt, you get a Blot for the Objects you're short.
          Blots become a sort of "negative Object."
          v0.3: I am removing the concepts of Equivalence and
          Convertibility from this Proposal, the concepts are severable 
          enough, and the idea behind all this _was_ to simplify 
          things.}


Let the following rule be created;
{Title: Transferable Objects}

     The Rules can define certain Classes of Objects as Transferable.  A 
     Transferable Object shall be Transferred whenever the Actual Owner
     of such an Object desires that Object to be Transferred to another
     entity and repots the desired Transfer to the Recordkeepor of that
     Object.
     
     A Class of Object shall not be Transferable unless the Rules
     explicitly define it so.

{Comment: A basic Rule to cover transfers between Players.
          v0.4 clarifed that only Actual Owners can cause Transfers.}


Let the following rule be created;
{Title: Personal Objects}

     The Rules can define certain Classes of Objects as Personal.  
     Personal Objects are only permitted to remain in the possession of 
     Players or the Bank.  If a Personal Object is in the possession of 
     a non-Player entity, then the Recordkeepor of that Object must 
     immediately Transfer that Object to the non-Player Entity's
     Executor, or (if it has no Executor) to the Bank.

     A Class of Object shall not be Personal unless the Rules explicitly
     define it so.

     The Recorkeepor is charged with detecting and reporting these
     changes.

{Comment: There are a number of Objects that we want to restrict to 
          Players. Blots and Kudos being two that come to mind right 
          now.  If we ever re-introduce something like Win Tokens, they 
          should be Personal as well. Note, this is not an automagical
          process, a Blot could exist in a Group "treasury," but it
          would be illegal for the Herald to let it stay there. And any 
          transfer of it wouldn't be retroactive, but only as of the 
          moment the Herald decided to move it.}


Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Objects Changed by Proposal}

     If a Proposal directly orders changes to any Objects, and does not 
     itself specify a Player to report those changes to the 
     Recordkeepors of those Objects, then the Assessor shall report 
     those changes.

{Comment: Prevents a potential conflict with some prior Rules.}


Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Reporting Object Changes, Timing}

     Whenever the Rules require a Player to report a change in an Object 
     to that Object's Recordkeepor, that Player shall make eir Report of 
     the change as soon as possible after the Rules require em to do so.

     Whenever a Recordkeepor of an Object receives a report in the 
     change of an Object, and that report caused a change in the Legal 
     State of that Object, e must then make the corresponding change in 
     the Actual State of that Object as soon as possible after receiving 
     the report.

{Comment: Fine point here, a change can be a Legal Change if never
          received by the Recordkeepor, but if so, e's not bound by the
          ASAP clause to make the Actual Change until a COE or CFJ finds
          the omission.  And then the change only happens when the
          Recordkeepor decides to make it.}

==============================================================
Part II: Probate


Rule 1601 (Probate) is amended to read as follows;

      No entity may be destroyed while it possesses any Objects;
      if an entity which possesses any Objects would otherwise be
      destroyed, it shall instead be placed in Probate, and its
      destruction deferred until it leaves Probate.  Such an
      entity is a "terminal estate."

      An entity leaves Probate when eir Executor in Probate announces
      that Probate is completed.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would destroy an
      entity while it possesses any Objects.

      When a Player is deregistered, e shall be placed in Probate.  A
      deregistered Player is a "terminal estate" for the purpose of
      Probate, but ceases to be such if e reregisters while still in
      Probate.


Rule 1637 (Wills) is amended to read as follows;

      A Will is an SLC.  The Jurisdiction of a Will is always empty.
      Each Will is associated with exactly one entity.  The Notary
      shall be the Maintainer of all Wills.

      A Will shall specify the heirs of the entity with which it is
      associated, and how the Transferable Objects possessed by that
      entity and its other assets will be divided amongst those heirs
      when that entity becomes a terminal estate in Probate.

      When a entity's Will is executed, the Executor in Probate of that
      entity shall, as soon as possible, report all Transfers required
      by the Will to the appropriate Recordkeepors, excepting those
      Transfers which specify Objects that the entity does not possess.

      A Will is created or amended by the Execution of an Application
      to Create a Will.  Such an Application must clearly identify the
      entity with which the Will is to be associated, requires the
      Signature of the Executor of the entity with which the Will is
      to be associated, and is Executed by submitting it to the
      Notary.  The effect of Executing such an Application is to
      create a Will associated with that entity.  Any prior Will
      associated with that entity is destroyed at the same time.


Rule 1738 (Executors in Probate) is amended to read as follows;

     Whenever there is an entity in Probate which does not have an
     Executor in Probate, the Notary shall nominate a Player to be
     that entity's Executor in Probate.  E shall announce this
     appointment in the Public Forum.

     The Executor in Probate of an entity is the Executor of that
     entity, and empowered only to report Transfers of Objects
     possessed by that entity.  This takes precedence over Rules that
     provide broader authority for an Executor.
      
     The Executor in Probate must do the following upon eir nomination, 
     in the order given, and perform no other acts on behalf of the 
     terminal estate e represents.  E must not initiate a step until the 
     prior one is complete:

       i) The Executor in Probate must first report to the Herald the 
          destruction of all Blots possessed by the terminal estate e 
          represents. E must do so as soon as possible.  This step shall 
          be complete only when all Blots possessed by the terminal
          estate are Actually Destroyed by the Herald or, if the 
          terminal estate possesses no Blots, this step shall be
          completed immediately.

      ii) Then, as soon as possible thereafter, the Executor in Probate 
          must report all Transfers of Transferable Objects possessed by
          the terminal estate as required by that entity's Will--
          excepting any impossible Transfers, or Transfers of Objects
          the Terminal Estate does not possess-- This step shall be
          complete only when all Transfers required by this step are
          Actually made by the appropriate Recordkeepors, or, 
          if no such Transfers are Required, or no Will exists, this 
          step shall be completed immediately.

     iii) Then, as soon as possible thereafter, the Executor in Probate 
          must report the Transfer of all remaining Objects (if any) in 
          that entity's possession to the Bank. This step shall be 
          complete only when all such Transfers are Actually made by the 
          appropriate Recordkeepors, or, if no Objects remain in the 
          possession of the terminal estate, this step shall be 
          completed immediately.

      iv) Then, as soon as possible thereafter, the Executor in Probate 
          must announce, in the Public Forum, that the terminal estate
          has left Probate.

      The Executor in Probate of an entity ceases to be its Executor
      in Probate when e announces, in accordance with the above steps,
      that the entity is no longer in Probate, or when e announces that
      e resigns as that entity's Executor in Probate.

      The Notary shall keep a record of each entity in Probate, and
      the Executor in Probate of each entity in Probate.

{Comments: This streamlines the whole Probate process, eliminating the
           overhead created by allowing debt in such a small economy.
           v0.2 avoided elJefe's infinite loop.}


Rule 1739 (The Probate Code) is repealed

{Comment: Without TOs or POs, there's no Debt as such, and no such thing
          as a creditor or a debtor.  Therefore, most of this Rule's 
          function is subsumed by the above Rule.}

============================================================
Part III: The Bank


Rule 1470 (The Bank) is amended to read as follows;

     There shall exist a Nomic Entity called the Bank.  The Bank is
     permitted to possess any Object.  This Rule takes precedence over 
     any Rule that would forbid the Bank from owning a particular
     Object.

{Comment: No such thing as mint authority.}


Rule 1735 (The Chancellor as Bank's Executor) is repealed.

{Comment: having the Chancellor as an interface between the Officers and
     the bank IMHO is a needless level of complication.  Better to give 
     the individual Recordkeepors the power to manipulate Objects.


Rule 1479 (Definition of "Pay Out" and "Bill") is amended to
read as follows;

     Whenever a Rule calls for a Player to pay out some number of
     Objects to some entity, or to report that an entity receives or 
     gains some number of Objects, that Player shall report, to the
     appropriate Recordkeepor, a Transfer of those Objects from the
     Bank to that entity for the number specified.
     
     Whenever a Rule calls for a Player to bill some number of
     Objects to some entity, or to report that an entity loses or 
     is penalized some number of Objects, that Player shall report to 
     the appropriate Recordkeepor, a Transfer of Objects from that 
     entity to the Bank for the number specified.

{Comment: v0.2 followed some language suggestions.}


===========================================================
Part IV: (ex-)Currencies

Rule 1701 (Proposal Notes) is amended to read as follows;

     There is a Class of Objects known as Proposal Notes. (P-Notes)
     Their Recordkeepor is the Promotor.  The Promotor has the duty to 
     publish, at least once a week in the Public Forum, a report of the 
     number of P-Notes owned by each entity that possesses P-Notes, and 
     a list of all the changes in P-Note holdings since the last such 
     report with the reason for those changes.

     The Class of Proposal Notes is Transferable.

{Comment: v0.3 Redid the Rule to conform to the changes I made in
          Decimal Objects' definitional Rule.
          v0.4 Decided simplicity was served by axing Decimal Objects.}


Rule 1702 (Petition Fee for Proposals) is amended to read as follows;

      All Proposals have associated with them a Petition fee.  The
      Petition fee for any Proposal is one P-Note, unless another Rule
      specifies a higher fee.  This rule takes precedence over any
      Rule that would require a lower fee, no fee, or a fee paid in
      Objects other than P-Notes.

      The Petition Fee for a Proposal is paid when an entity
      Transfers the amount of that Proposal's Petition Fee, provided
      that e indicates clearly that the Transfer is being made to pay 
      the Petition fee for that Proposal and e makes no other claim
      as to the purpouse of the Transfer.


Rule 1696 (Voting Tokens) is amended to read as follows;

      There is a Class of Objects known as Voting Tokens. (VTs) The
      Recordkeepor for VTs is the Assessor.

      The Assessor's Report includes the number of VTs possessed by
      each entity which possesses them, and the changes thereof since
      the last posting of the Assessor's Report.

      The Class of Voting Tokens is Transferable.

{Comment: v0.3 see comments re: P-Notes above.
          v0.4 Decided simplicity was served by axing Decimal Objects.}


Rule 1442 (Using VTs) is amended to read as follows;

     The casting of any votes may only be achieved by the Transfer
     of VTs to the Bank, as specified below.

     A Voting Entity Votes upon a Proposal when e, during the Voting
     Period of that Proposal, informs the Assessor of the Vote (or
     Votes) e is casting upon that Proposal.

     At the end of the Voting Period, the Assessor shall Transfer enough 
     Voting Tokens from the Voting Entity to pay for the last Vote (or 
     set of Votes) cast by that entity during the Voting Period.

     The Assessor is charged with detecting and reporting these
     Transfers.


===========================================================
Part V: Blots & Indulgences


Rule 1435 (Definition of Indulgences, Blots and Immaculate) is
amended to read as follows;

     There is a Class of Objects named Indulgences, which is 
     Transferable. There is a Class of Objects named Blots, which 
     is Personal and not Transferable.  The Recordkeepor for both Blots 
     and Indulgences is the Herald.

     A Player who owns no Blots is Immaculate.  It is a Win-Preventing 
     condition for a Player to have one or more Blots.

{Comment: The language fell out neatly given the prior Rules, and 
          finally, after having its status reduced to first a negative 
          value of a "real" currency, then to a Payment Order, a Blot 
          regains its status as an entity in its own right.;) }

Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: Erasing Blots)

     Any Player who Actually has Blots can erase as many Blots as e
     Actually has Indulgences.  This occurs only in the following
     manner:

       i) The Player notifies the Herald that e is erasing a number of 
          Blots.  This number must be less than or equal to the number
          of Blots e Actually possesses.
          
      ii) If that number is equal to or less than the number of 
          Indulgences possessed by the Player, this notification becomes 
          the report to the Herald of the Legal Destruction of that 
          Number of both Blots and Indulgences possessed by that Player.

{Comment: v0.3 This is a new Rule, because I eliminated Convertibility.
          v0.4 Added requirement that the request be to destroy no more
          Blots than the Player Actually has.}


Rule 1712 (Distribution of Indulgences) is amended to read as follows;

      At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Herald shall, among all
      Players, randomly distribute a number of Indulgences equal to the 
      number of Blots Actually Created in the past Week : for each such
      Indulgence, the Herald shall randomly select one Player and Create
      an Indulgence in the posession of that Player.  The Herald is
      charged with detecting and reporting these changes.

{Comment: Added "Actually" so that there's no ambiguity.  (Actual Blots
          are the ones in the report, which doesn't change, ever, after
          it's made.)}


Rule 1437 (Fugitives from Justice) is amended to read as follows;

     When an Executor in Probate reports the Legal Destruction of Blots 
     belonging to the terminal estate of a deregistered Player, the 
     Herald shall assign the person who was that player a value of 
     Fugitive Blots equal to the number of Blots the Herald Destroyed.  
     That person becomes a Fugitive from Justice.  Herald shall keep a 
     record of the value of Fugitive Blots attributed to each Fugitive 
     from Justice.

     At the beginning of each month, the Herald shall halve the
     value of Fugitive Blots attributed to each Fugitive of Justice,
     rounding down; but no Fugitive from Justice shall have the
     number of Fugitive Blots attributed to em reduced to less than
     one by this method.

     When a Fugitive from Justice reregisters, the Herald shall
     Create in eir possession a number of Blots equal in number to
     the value of Fugitive Blots attributed to em at the time of eir
     reregistration.  Players shall not have Fugitive Blots.

{Comment: Changed a few things to make clear that Fugitive Blots aren't
          an Object, nor do Players possess them.}

===========================================================
Part VI: Objects Not Created by the Rules.


Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Creation of Classes of Objects}

     Classes of Objects may be created only through explicit definition 
     in the Rules, or by proceedures defined in the Rules.

     The Rules may empower non-Rule entities to create unique Classes of 
     Objects, if such an entity creates a Class of Object, that entity's 
     executor shall be the Recordkeepor for that Class of Objects.

     A Class of Object created by an entity other than the Rules is 
     called a "Common" Class of Object.  The Recordkeepor for any Common 
     Class of Object is permitted to Create any number of those Objects 
     within the possession of the entity that created that Class of 
     Object, e is also permitted to Destroy any number of those Objects 
     in that entity's possession that does not exceed the number 
     possessed by that entity.  The Recordkeepor is required to detect 
     and report these changes.

     Each Player is empowered to Create Common Classes of Objects.

{Common: v0.4 Replacement for Mint authority, to allow Group Coins, and
         the newer, player-mandated "Currencies"}


Rule 766 (Groups) is amended to replace the text;

     "Each Group has Mint Authority." 

with this text;

     "Each Group is empowered to Create Common Classes of Objects."


Rule 1446 (Contests) is amended to replace the text;

     "Each Contest has Mint Authority." 

with this text;

     "Each Contest is empowered to Create Common Classes of Objects."

===========================================================
Part VII: Cleaning up refrences to Obsolete Terms

Rule 1677 (Currency Awards for New Players) has its Title change
to "Awards for New Players"

Rule 1451 (Disowning Proposals) is amended to read;

      A Proposal is disowned when its Proposer sends a message to the
      Public Forum disowning it, provided that the Proposal in
      question either has not yet been distributed, or less than four
      days have passed since its distribution.  A Proposal can only be
      disowned by its Proposer, and then only if its Proposer is
      neither the Assessor nor has been the Assessor at any time after
      the distribution of that Proposal.

      The Assessor shall bill the disowning Player a fee of one
      P-Note.  All other payments or awards which would result from the 
      submission of, voting upon, or adoption of that Proposal do not 
      take place, regardless of the outcome of the Vote on that 
      Proposal.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would seek to
      cause a payment or award as a result of the submission of, voting 
      upon, or adoption of, a Disowned Proposal.


Rule 1539 (Regulations and Membership of Contests) is amended by
replacing the word "Currency" with the word "Object," and the word
"Currencies" with the word "Objects."


Rule 1377 (The Herald) is amended by removing the word "Currency."


Rule 502 (Salary for Judges) is amended by replacing the text;

     "If a decision is not subject to an appeal at the end of the
      Nomic Week in which it is made, but is subsequently appealed in
      a later Nomic Week and overturned on appeal, the Clerk of the
      Court shall vacate the Payment Order paying the salary
      originally received for that decision."

with the text;

     "If a decision is not subject to an appeal at the end of the
      Nomic Week in which it is made, but is subsequently appealed in
      a later Nomic Week and overturned on appeal, the Clerk of the
      Court shall transfer the salary originally received for that
      decision back to the Bank."


Rule 1736 (Injunctions on Payment Orders) is hereby repealed.


Rule 1737 (Injunctions on Vacating Payment Orders) is hereby repealed.


Rule 1661 (The Right of Patronage) is amended to read;

      A Speaker who is not Tainted has the Right of Patronage.  This
      Right is the authority to, once a week, order the award of
      specific Objects from the Bank to specific Players, only as
      specified in this Rule.

      The Speaker exercises this right by posting to the Public Forum
      an order to Transfer one VT from the Bank to one Player.
    
      The Player to receive the award must not have received a Patronage 
      award within the preceding four weeks, and the Speaker must
      provide a reason along with the order.

      The VT is Legally Transferred at the time of the Speaker's order,
      an this order is also the report of the transfer to the Assessor.

      Such awards are only permitted to recognize acts the Speaker
      believes to be of benefit of the Agora community, acts that the
      Speaker believes to exceed the call of duty, or acts that the
      Speaker believes to be of extreme sacrifice for the good of the
      Game.


Rule 1653 (Groups and Unity Vote)

      If a Group, during the Voting Period of a Proposal, Actually
      Transfers 3 VTs from itself to the Bank for the purpose of
      declaring Unity on that Proposal, casts exactly 3 Votes FOR or 3
      Votes AGAINST the Proposal in question, and informs the Assessor
      that it is electing to cast a Unity Vote on that Proposal, then 
      that Group has declared Unity on that Proposal.

      If a Group declares Unity on a Proposal, and all of its Members
      Vote on that Proposal, and all of the Votes of its Members are
      the same as the Votes of the Group, then the Group is entitled
      to cast 3 Votes on that Proposal, at zero cost.  Furthermore,
      the Assessor shall pay out 3 VTs to the Group.

      If a Group declares Unity on a Proposal, and not all of its
      Members express an Intent to Vote, or not all of the intended
      Votes of its Members are the same as the intended Votes of the
      Group, then the Group is not entitled to cast any Votes on that
      Proposal, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

PROTO: Another Interesting Proposal Mechanisms

Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Proposal Applications}

     There is a type of Application known as an Proposal Application.  
     Such an Application is executed by submitting it to the Promotor.  
     This application takes effect when executed.  For a Proposal 
     Application to take effect it must;

       i) Indicate it is a Proposal Application
      ii) Include the text of a single Proposal, clearly indicated as 
          such.
     iii) Specify the non-player entity which the Rules shall deem to 
          have submitted the included Proposal.  This entity cannot be 
          an entity defined elsewhere in the Rules as a Proposing 
          Entity.
      iv) Include the signature of the Executor of the non-player entity 
[A          specified in iii) above. (A Proposal Application may never be 
          executed on behalf of an entity with no Executor.)
       v) Include the signature of at least one other Player.

     If all the above conditions are met, the Application will be 
     executed upon its receipt by the Promotor.  The effect of the 
     Application is to temporarily designate the non-Player entity 
     specified in the Application as a Proposing Entity, and to submit 
     the included Proposal on behalf of that entity.  For the purpose of 
     the Rules governing Proposals, the included Proposal shall be 
     deemed to have been submitted when the Application was executed.  
     Immediately after this submission, the entity will cease being a 
     Proposing Entity.  (Losing this designation will not change the 
     identity of the Proposer, it will remain the non-Player entity 
     specified in the Application.)

{Comment: This allows Groups, Contests, and any entity with an Executor
          to make a proposal.  I've always been interested in allowing
          the possibility of Groups to propose legislation.  This also
          allows an easier method for group authorship of Rules rather
          than direct fiddling with the Attributions.  All you need is
          to create a contest called "Me & Him Inc." and submit your
          Proposal Application.}

An excellent Judgement, Kolja. You are to be commended for a lucid
and close reading of the Rules. You'll make a fine Appellate Justice
should you ever come to sit on a Board of Appeals.

H. Herald Crito,

I hereby transfer a Kudo 

FROM Vanyel, who has, unfortunately, allowed the Archives to fall
into a state of some disrepair, significantly reducing their usefulness,

TO Kolja, in recognition of his fine Judgement in CFJ 1065.

An Election is currently being held for every Office. As you can imagine,
this is a lot of work for the Registrar. To make my job a little easier,
I will be withholding the announcement of Candidates, and the commencement
of Voting Periods (if any) in the earliest-begun Elections (those for
Registrar, Notary and Wizard, whose NPs commenced on Oct 30 and Oct
31), until the NPs in the other Elections have also concluded, on Nov 11.

Registrar pro-tem Steve

Okay, I'll admit it, I'm too lazy to go through and exhaustively 
check the ruleset, but I'm pretty sure that Harlequin is guilty of 
not completed my Probate in a timely fashion. Therefore, in order to 
attempt to get out of Probate in time to reregister sometime soon, I 
make the following CFJ (even though I doubt it will help much):

Chaos Harlequin has violated Rule 1738.
