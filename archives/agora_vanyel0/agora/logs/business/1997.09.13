I hereby request to be registered as a player, and specifically as the 
player known as 'ChrisM' under Rule 1432, Uniqueness of Players. At the 
same time, hello to everyone, especially those of you who remember me... 
I'm glad to see Agora is still running well!

By the way, I was just looking at Chuck's Agora page... darn good logo, 
don't you think? Who designed that, anyway?..

:)

H. CotC Andre!

In the interests of settling the status of CFJ 938, I hereby make
the following CFJ:

Statement:

Rule 789 should be interpreted such that a document purporting to be
a Call for Judgement alleging that a Rule should be interpreted in a
certain way, but which does not include a list of Relevant Rules
assembled by the Caller, which includes the Rule being interpreted, is
not in fact a CFJ, and that therefore neither the Clerk of the Courts
nor any other Player incur any obligations regarding it.

Relevant Rules: 789, 991

Argument:

I don't really have particularly strong feelings about this one way
or the other, but it seems we need a decision, and this will set a
precedent we can use in future cases, should any such arise. I have
a mild tendency to think that the Statement is TRUE, for reasons which
I outline below.

There are reasonable arguments on both sides, which the Judge must
choose between. These turn on how the word 'must' in R789 should be
interpreted:

      A CFJ alleging a Rule should be interpreted in a certain way
      must be accompanied by a list of relevant Rules, assembled by
      the Caller, which includes the Rule being interpreted.

On the one hand, we could interpret this 'must' as imposing an obligation
on a Caller to include a list of Relevant Rules, an obligation which, if
the Caller fails to meet it, results in the Caller having violated R789.
On this reading, there is no reason to think that the legality of the CFJ
is brought into question by the Caller's having violated R789, and so the
Statement would be FALSE.

On the other hand, we could interpret this 'must' as imposing a condition
on what it takes to be a CFJ. On this reading, it is partially definitive
of being a CFJ (of the relevant kind) that it be accompanied by a list
of Relevant Rules. This would bring R789 into conflict with R991, which
offers an incompatible definition:

      Any document submitted to the Clerk of the Courts and which is
      clearly marked as a Call for Judgement is a Call for Judgement.

Since R789 wins this conflict by virtue of its lower Number, we arrive
at the conclusion that the Statement is TRUE.

Two possible interpretations, both plausible. Is there any reason to
favour one over the other? I think there is such a reason: the
precise wording of R789, which states that "A CFJ...must...", and not
"The Caller of a CFJ...must...". I think this gives us a reason to
regard to R789 more plausibly as imposing a condition on what it
takes to be a CFJ than as imposing a requirement on the Caller. It
may not be a terribly powerful reason for preferring the second
interpretation to the first, but in the absence of other compelling
reasons to make one judgement rather than the other, it may prove
decisive. At any rate, I offer it to the Judge for eir consideration.

Requested Injunction:

I request that the Judge issue an Injunction requiring the Rulekeepor
to annotate R789 with the Statement, as e is permitted to do by R789.
[Maybe at last I'll get my self-referential annotation of R789!]
