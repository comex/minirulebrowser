We now have, by my count, 9 Rebels, out of 16 Active Players. That includes
Swann, who is the Miscreant. So there is a 10/17 ~= 59% chance of success.
I like those odds. So, here goes nothing:

I Call for Revolt!

Bring on the Night of the Long Knives!

I hesitate to bring this up, as I am pleased with the ultimate
result, but I cannot let the method pass unchallenged.

I claim that the above (specifically, the statement "The Revolt
fails!") is in error, as the determination does not meet the
definition of random set out in R1079.  Thus, the
Registrar has not yet made the random selection required
by R1664, and the Revolt has not yet either succeeded or
failed.  "Unknown" is not the same as "random".
