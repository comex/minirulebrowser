Calabresi is *not* Maybe Absent.  Rule 1042, in part:

      If a Player posts to the Public Forum clearly identifying a
      particular Active Player, and alleging that that Player has
      Abandoned the game, then the Player alleged to have Abandoned
      becomes Maybe Absent.  If a Player has been Maybe Absent
      continuously for two weeks, e becomes Absent.  If a Player has
      been On Hold continuously for sixty days, e becomes Absent.

Calabresi is Absent, therefore not Active, therefore Steve's allegation
that Calabresi has Abandoned doesn't trigger Rule 1042 in any way.


I hereby state that Calabresi is Abandoning.

I'm not sure I got the wording right.  Just to be sure:

I hereby allege that I have Abandoned.

However, it seems we've repealed the Rule stating what happens when a CFJ
finds that a paradox has occurred.  Sigh.

How could the use of the plural form 'Injunctions' possibly be used
to indicate that there was more than Order? As you yourself point out,
R663 allows a single Injunction to require the issuing of more than
one Order. Morendil could have issued a single Injunction applying to
all the Officers, requiring them make multiple POs. All he needed to
have to have done was to say:

      I hereby issue an Injunction, applying to each current Officer,
      requiring them issue Payment Orders of such-and-such a kind.

But that's not what he did. Your first observation was the correct one:
the fact that Morendil used the plural form 'Injunctions' must be taken
to indicate that there is one Injunction for each current Officer who
meets the description.

>The last sentence/paragraph reads:

The last paragraph is distinctly *not* like the other three, in that
it does not use the construction "for each ucrrent Officer".

"...Injunctions, applying to the Registrar, requiring em to issue,
for each Player..." is very clearly one Injunction for each Player.

I don't see how you can possibly read this as only one Injunction.

In light of these errors, I hereby call for the Appeal of CFJ 1055.

If the Currencies "Orders", "Payment Orders", and "Transfer Orders"
survived everything else that has recently happened, then they ceased
to exist when the Misanthropist's Group was dissolved.  (Otherwise,
they didn't exist anyway and this message has no meaning.)

Decision of pro-Justiciar Zefram: OVERTURN/reverse

Others have already established that the decision of this CFJ depends
primarily on the number of Injunctions issued by Morendil in CFJ 1045,
which in turn depends on the interpretation of the wording e used in
issuing the Injunctions.  Let us examine this.  The first paragraph:

|I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
|applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
|Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
|Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the sum total of Payment
|Orders in Indulgences naming that Player as Payor that they have thus
|far executed and have not been satisfied.

The form here is "I hereby issue Injunctions ... applying to all current
Officers, requiring them to ... for every Player, ...".  The use of
the plural "Injunctions" very strongly suggests that there is more than
one Injunction: in normal English usage, the unadorned plural can never
be correctly applied to a singular object.  The correct interpretation
must be consistent with normal English usage, unless there is no such
interpretation.

This form of words is, of course, ambiguous.  Excepting the possibility
that the paragraph is a single Injunction, there are three reasonable
interpretations.  One is that there is one Injunction per Officer, the
interpretation used by Andre.  This is a slightly awkward interpretation;
it requires that "applying to all current Officers" be taken to iterate
through the Officers.

The second possibility is that there is one Injunction per Player.
The form used is then "I hereby issue Injunctions ... for every Player,
...", which, although not perfect English ("each" would be more natural
than "every"), is a normal means of expressing iteration.  The content
of the first ellipsis, "applying to all current Officers, requiring
them to issue,", reads quite naturally as describing properties of
the Injunctions.  Although this interpretation means that the sentence
contains two interleaved phrases ("I hereby issue Injunctions for every
Player" and "applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue
a Payment Order ..."), this is entirely reasonable and clear.

The third possibility is that there is one Injunction per {Officer,
Player} pair.  In this interpretation, both "applying to all current
Officers" and "for every Player" are taken as iterative constructs.
The notes about the unnaturalness of the first interpretation also apply
here.  However, this interpretation is more natural than the first,
in that the final clause, "to issue ... a Payment Order ...", being
singular, fits naturally with the rest of the sentence, not requiring
any implicit iteration.

I choose not to decide which of these three interpretations is the best,
as that is not required in order to decide this CFJ, except in that I
find each to be prefereable to the interpretation as a single Injunction.
However, I do prefer the second and third interpretations to the first
-- and both of these would result in more Infractions than Andre issued
Payment Orders for.

The second and third of Morendil's paragraphs each have identical form
to the first, and the same arguments apply.  The fourth is different:

|I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
|applying to the Registrar, requiring em to issue, for each Player, a
|Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, that Player as Payee, for an
|amount of 5 VTs. (So we can Vote on Proposals, y'know...)

Here, interpreting "applying to the Registrar" as iterative would be
highly unnatural, as it is singular, and the corresponding pronoun, "em",
is also singular.  The only iterative construct is "for each Player".
This interpretation -- one Injunction per Player -- makes the entire
sentence read as natural English, albeit with a little more interleaving
than is usual.  This interpretation is, as before (but more so), vastly
preferable to the singular interpretation.

I therefore find that there were more Injunctions than Andre issued
Payment Orders for.  There were, unquestionably, more than the four
Injunctions to which the Statement refers.

Finally, observe part of the Statement:

|                          the number of Infractions allegedly
|committed by Judge Morendil in issuing Injunctions in eir Judgement
|of CFJ 1045 did not exceed 4,

The number of Infractions *allegedly* committed most certainly exceeds 4.
It was alleged at one point that Morendil committed 44 Infractions.
On this point alone, the Statement could reasonably be Judged FALSE,
regardless of the number of Infractions actually committed.

Decision of pro-CotC Crito: OVERTURN/reverse

Again, the decision depends on the actual number of Injunctions that Morendil's
statements describe.  I have noticed one interpretation that seems to be
inescapable upon close reading of Morendil's statements.

"I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,..."

Quoting from R1736:

      The Rules may require, in certain cases, that a Judge issue an
      Injunction ordering the execution of a Payment Order.  

I note that an Injunction of the sort described in Rule 1736 is an Injuction
for the execution of exactly one Payment Order.

Therefore, the use of the plural and the reference to R1736 leads me to the
conclusion that Morendil's statements must be interpreted as issuing one
Injunction for each Payment Order to be executed, whatever eir intention.  So,
how many is this?  For the fourth statement, it is clearly 21 Payment Orders
(one for each Player registered at that time).  For the first statement, it
works out to 12 different Payment Orders.  Already we have exceeded the 28
instances of Wrongful Injunction Infractions handed out by CotC Andre. 
Therefore, I must conclude that both clauses of the statement of CFJ 1055 are
FALSE and so do hereby order that Vir's original Judgement be overturned.

Decision of the Justiciar:  Dismissal incorrect

I sympathize with the Judge, but he erred in dismissing without giving a
legal reason as prescribed in Rule 1565.  In the words of Rule 1694, the
dismissal was not "properly made."

There is no need for the Board to recommend a specific action. If the Board
finds the dismissal was not properly made, the CFJ is to be reassigned by
the CotC.

Regards,
-- elJefe, Justiciar
