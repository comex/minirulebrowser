"A ceremonial handshake even more useless than usual!"  I love
it!  Now *this* is a good reason to vote for an impeachment.
(Who says procedural nomics can't be silly?  Procedural
silliness is much more fun than substantive silliness, anyway. :)

I vote FOR the Impeachment of Speaker-Elect Blob.

You are right. Michael, please accept my full and unreserved apology
for dumping a lot of work on you without any warning. This apology
should have come a lot earlier, but better late than never. With your
permission, I should like to consider the matter closed.

H. Herald Crito,

I hereby transfer a Kudo

FROM myself, for not having offered the above apology much earlier,
TO   Michael, for his exemplarary conduct.

In addition to the current party politics, I would like to see this
separation of Assessor/Accountor idea tried out in practice.

Therefore, I vote for Crito as Accountor.

Greetings,

I submit the following CFJ, barring Blob, General Chaos, and Swann.

    The last sentence of Rule 1766 prevents the remainder of that 
    rule from granting additional votes.

The last sentence of rule 1766 states that 'This provision shall not 
increase the maximum number of votes that are permitted to be cast by 
that Player.' The previous sentence states '... then that Player may 
cast two additional votes on that Proposal beyond what e is otherwise 
entitled to cast.' I argue that the first sentence would, in fact, 
raise the maximum number of votes above what it would otherwise be 
(two), and thus the second sentence renders that null.

Rule 206 says that 'Each Voting Entity has two votes on a proposal, 
unless another Rule says otherwise.' This clearly establishes a 
maximum number of legal votes. The second sentence of that paragraph 
says 'However, no such Entity shall have more than five votes on any 
Proposal, regardless of what any other Rule may say to the contrary.' 
This establishes a second maximum on the number of votes which may 
legally cast, such that the maximum equates to 'two, plus any granted 
by other rules, or five, whichever is lower'.

Evidence:
Rule 206/10 (Power=2)
Voting Entities and Votes

      A Voting Entity is an Entity which is generally authorized by
      the Rules to cast a vote or votes on a Proposal, although other
      Rules may withdraw this authorization from a Voting Entity in
      specific circumstances without that Entity thereby ceasing to be
      a Voting Entity. No Entity is permitted to vote on a Proposal
      unless it is a Voting Entity, and only those Entities designated
      by the Rules to be Voting Entities are Voting Entities. Players
      and Groups are Voting Entities.

      Each Voting Entity has two votes on a Proposal, unless another
      Rule says otherwise. However, no such Entity shall have more
      than five votes on any Proposal, regardless of what any other
      Rule may say to the contrary.

Rule 1766/0 (Power=1)
The Officer's Vote

      If a particular Proposal amends the duties or description of a
      particular Office, and a Player holds that Office in normal
      fashion, and that Player is not the same Player who Proposed the
      Proposal, then that Player may cast two additional votes on that
      Proposal beyond what e is otherwise entitled to cast.  This
      shall not increase the maximum number of votes that are
      permitted to be cast by that Player.

H Promotor, 

I hereby make the following proposal, and spend 2 P-Notes to increase
its Priority.

Proposal: Standing Down

Create a rule with title "Standing Down" and text:

     During the Voting Period of an Election, any Candidate for that
     Election may stand down, by posting a message to the Public 
     Forum to that effect. The player is then no longer to be 
     considered a Candidate for that Election. Any further votes
     cast in eir favour are invalid, and e cannot win the Election.

     When a player stands down, e has the option of transferring all
     votes so far cast for em to another Candidate in the Election,
     if one exists. To do so, e must explicitly state which Candidate
     e is transferring eir votes to, in the same message as the 
     announcement that e is standing down. Any votes transferred in
     this fashion will be considered to be cast for the receiving
     Candidate.

     This rule takes precedence over other rules for determining the
     Winner of an Election.
