Firstly, I will oppose this as much as I can (If Crated can be taken as 
created) ..... In fact I might go as far as making another "better" 
proposeal explaining the wonders of Earl Grey tea.

Secondly, I don't see the point of giving entities such as tea 
defenitions with in Agora (It's just silly).  Why don't you also define 
a "noxious beverage" or even "noxious".  If fact I will make a 
proposal....

The proposal will be titled "defenition of noxious" and will start with 
**start proposal** and end with **end proposal**

**start proposal**
create a rule with the title "defenition of noxious" with the following 
text.

When Agora officially regards an entity as noxious, is shall be taken 
that the entity is of a good quality and enjoyed by most players.

**end proposal**

Well I hope this is stupid enough.......

Peekee

This message contains exactly one Proposal.  The Proposal begins
immediately after the line marked "**START PROPOSAL" and ends at the
end of the message.

The following Proposal is to be titled "Give The Rulesets Dates" and is 
to have Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1681 be amended to read:

There is a format of the Ruleset known as the Short Logical
Ruleset (SLR).  In this format, each Rule is assigned to a Rule
Category, and the Rules are grouped according to their Category.
Within a Category, the ordering of Rules is decided by the
Rulekeepor.  All existing Rule Categories must be listed, even
if no Rules are currently assigned to the Category.

The SLR must contain:
*The date that it was last changed, or modified.

The listing of each Rule in the SLR must include:
* The Rule Number
* The Rule's Amendment Number
* The Rule's Power
* The Rule's Title
* The Rule's text
* Any annotations to the Rule required by Order

The Rulekeepor is strongly encouraged not to include any
additional information in the SLR, except that which increases
the readability of the SLR.

There is a format of the Ruleset known as the Full Logical
Ruleset (FLR).  In this format, Rules are assigned to the
same Category and presented in the same order as in the
SLR.  The FLR must contain all the information required
to be in the SLR, as well as:

Also the FLR must contain;
* A brief description of each Category
* Any historical annotations which the Rulekeepor is
required to record.

The Rulekeepor is also free to include any other information
which e feels may be helpful in the use of the Ruleset in the
FLR.

I hereby submit the following Proposal:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal Chuck0121
Power to the Rulekeepor

Rule 947 is amended to read:

      If a Proposal is adopted which, as part of all of its effect,
      repeals one or more Rules, and immediately prior to the
      adoption of this Proposal there were more than 100 Rules, the
      Rulekeepor shall pay out 1 P-Note to the Proposer of that
      Proposal, if, in the Rulekeepor's estimation, the Proposal
      simplifies the Ruleset.  If the Rulekeepor decides that the
      Proposal does not simplify the Ruleset, e must announce this
      decision.

      When the Rulekeepor decides that such a Proposal does not
      simplify the Ruleset, the Executor of the Proposal's Proposer
      may reverse the Rulekeepor's decision Without Three Objections,
      provided the procedure for doing so is initiated within one
      week of the announcement of the Rulekeepor's decision.  When
      the Rulekeepor's decision is reversed in this manner, the
      Executor of the Proposal's Proposer shall pay out 1 P-Note
      to the Proposal's Proposer.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I transfer 1 P-Note to the Bank in order to increase the Priority
of the above Proposal.

Chuck

Here is a -rough- draft of a new concept for the voting system. 

Protoproposal: Shake up the voting system

Rule 1873 is hereby repealed.
Rule 1862 is hereby repealed.
Rule 1442 is hereby repealed.

Create a new rule reading:

Each Voting Entity shall submit one amount of Voting Tokens per
non-abstaining vote cast per proposal, which shall be referred to as the
Voting Bid for that vote.


Create a new rule reading:

There shall exist a number known as the Votes Available equal to half of
the number of active players eligible to vote, rounded down. The
Registrar shall include this value in eir report. This value shall be
determined at the beginning of each month, and shall take effect the
following Voting Period.

Upon acceptance of this proposal, the Registrar shall determine the
Votes Available as soon as possible, and post this value to the Public
Forum. This value shall be the Votes Available until the next
determination, upon which this paragraph repeals itself.


Amend 879 by replacing the text reading

      Quorum for a Proposal is achieved if a vote is cast on that
      Proposal by one-third of Active Players not denied voting
      privileges, or one-fifth of all Players, whichever is greater.

to read as follows

      Quorum for a Proposal is achieved if the number of votes assessed
      on that proposal is no less than one-half of the Votes Available,
      rounded down.


Create a new rule reading:

The Assessor shall assess only the N votes with the greatest Voting Bid,
where N is the greatest integer not greater than the number of votes in
existance such that no unassessed vote has a Voting Bid equal to a vote
that has been assessed. Only assessed votes shall be counted with regard
to quorum and proposal acceptance. The Assessor shall bill each Voting
Entity a number of Voting Tokens equal to the total of the Voting Bids
of all assessed votes cast by that Entity. All other non-abstaining
votes submitted by Voting Entities are considered to be null votes with
no effect.
