[Parts Three and Four should be reviewed if Swann's Objects proto is adopted.]


Proto:  Plots (v1.6)


[Part One:  Rename Locations to Plots.  Discard Entities having
 Locations and Moving.]

Amend Rule 1706 to read:

     There is a class of Entities called Plots.  Each Plot has a unique
     name.  The Agoraverse is the set of all Plots.

     A Plot is Rule-Named if and only if it is referred to by name in
     the Rules.

Repeal Rule 1707.

Amend Rule 1708 to read:

     Two Plots may be Adjacent to each other.  No Plot is Adjacent to
     itself.

Repeal Rule 1709.

[Rule 1710 will be amended later.]

All Plots are destroyed.  [Yes, this is intended to destroy any and all
Locations-which-have-now-become-Plots-due-to-continuity.]

One hundred Plots are created with the names "Area XY", where X and Y are
each digits ranging from 0 to 9.  "Area XY" is Adjacent to "Area MN" (where
X, Y, M, and N are each digits ranging from 0 to 9) iff one of the following
conditions is true:
  X = M and Y-N = 1 (mod 10)
  X = M and N-Y = 1 (mod 10)
  X-M = 1 (mod 10) and Y = N
  M-X = 1 (mod 10) and Y = N

[The Cartographor is unofficially encouraged to use this text (possibly
 noting exceptions) as shorthand to represent these Adjacencies.]


[Part Two:  Create land ownership.]

Create a Rule titled "Landowners" with this text:

     Each non-Rule-Named Plot has an Executor, known as its Owner; each
     such Plot's initial Owner is the Bank.

     Rule-Named Plots never have an Executor or Owner.

     A Plot's Owner may change that Plot's name Without Objection.

Create a Rule titled "Buying Land" with this text:

     When a Plot is sold, its Owner before the sale is known as the
     Seller, and its Owner after the sale is known as the Buyer.

     For a Plot to be sold, the Seller must inform the Cartographor of
     the identity of the Plot and the Buyer; and the Buyer must agree
     to the sale, unless the Buyer is the Bank.

     For a Plot owned by the Bank to be sold, the Buyer must pay 4 VTs to
     the Bank for the sole purpose of buying that Plot.

     When a Plot is sold to the Bank, the Cartographor shall pay out 2 VTs
     to the Seller.

Create a Rule entitled "Winning by Ownership" with this text:

     Owning at least half of all Plots is a Winning Condition known as
     a Win by Ownership.  Upon the correct report of such a Win, all
     Plots Owned by the Winner become Owned by the Bank.


[Part Three:  Create something to do with the Plots you own]

Create a Rule entitled "Mules" with this text:

     Mules are a Currency.  Their MUQ is 1.  Their Recordkeepor is the
     Cartographor.

     A Mule's Owner may transfer that Mule to any Plot e owns, or vice
     versa, by executing a Transfer Order accordingly.  However, no Plot
     may possess more than one Mule.

Create a Rule entitled "Energy" with this text:

     Energy is a currency.  Its MUQ is 1.  Its Recordkeepor is the
     Cartographor.

The Bank has 100 Mules and 10000 units of Energy.

Amend Rule 1677 to read:

     Upon the start of a Player's Grace Period, the Registrar shall
     pay out to that Player an award of 5 Voting Tokens, 5 P-Notes,
     5 Mules, and 15 units of Energy.

Amend Rule 1701 by removing this paragraph:

     Whenever there exists a Player who has never before possessed
     any P-Notes, the Promotor shall pay out 5 P-Notes to that Player.

Each current Player gains 5 Mules and 20 units of Energy.

Create a Rule entitled "Structures" with this text:

     Any Mule within a Plot may become a Structure (unless it is one
     already) when its Owner pays the price of that type of Structure
     to the Bank.  Unless otherwise specified, the price is 4 units of
     Energy.

     A type of Structure exists only if the Rules explicitly define it.

     The following types of Structures exist:

       * Farms
       * Houses
       * Mines
       * Churches

     A Structure ceases to be a Structure when its Owner informs the
     Cartographor that it does so, or when it is no longer within a
     Plot.  At that time, its Owner receives half the price of that
     type of Structure, rounded down.

Create a rule titled "Upkeep on Structures" with this text:

     Monthly upkeep on Structures is equal to 2 units of Energy for the
     first Structure of each type, plus 1 unit of Energy for each
     additional Structure, except as otherwise specified.

     If an Owner does not pay the upkeep on all of eir Structures
     within one week of the beginning of the month, all of eir
     Structures collapse and are destroyed.

Create a rule titled "Production from Structures" reading:

     At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall pay
     out each Structure's Production to its Owner (if its Production
     is greater than zero).  Unless otherwise specified, each Structure's
     Production is as follows:

       * Farms - 5 VT
       * Houses - 1 P-Note
       * Mines - 1 units of Energy

     Churches have no Production.  However, each Church is considered
     to be two players for the purposes of randomly allocating
     Indulgences, and any Indulgences which would be given to a Church
     are instead given to its Owner.

Create a new Rule titled "Proximity of Plots" and this text:

     A Farm's Production is increased by 0.5 VT for each House or
     Church to which it is Adjacent, and decreased by 1 VT for each
     Mine to which it is Adjacent.

     A House's Production is increased by 1 P-Note for every 2 Farms
     to which it is Adjacent, and decreased by 1 P-Note for every 2 
     Mines to which it is Adjacent.

     A Mine's Production is not affected by Adjacency.


[Part Four:  Amend the Rule defining the Cartographor and eir duties]

Amend Rule 1710 to read:

     There is an Office of Cartographor. The Cartographor recieves a 
     salary equal to 2 times the Basic Officer Salary.

     At least once each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall post a 
     Report to the Public Forum containing the following information:

       * a list of all Plots
       * each Plot's Owner, and any changes in Ownership since the
           last Report
       * which Plots are Adjacent to which others
       * the ownership and location of all Mules
       * the ownership of all units of Energy
       * all Transfer Orders and Payment Orders specifying Mules or
         units of Energy since the last Report
       * what type of Structure (if any) each Mule is, and all cases
           of a Mule becoming or ceasing to be a Structure since the
           last Report


[Part Five:  Authorship]

Harlequin, Blob, and Antimatter become Authors of each Rule created or
amended earlier in this Proposal.


[Part Six:  Clean up other references to Locations]

Amend Rule 869 by removing the following paragraph:

     When a Player registers, eir Location is the Welcoming Center.

Amend Rule 1016 to read:

     At any time, each Player shall either be On Hold or Off Hold.
     This status shall not be changed except as specified in the
     Rules.

     When a Player registers (or reregisters), e is Off Hold.

     An Off Hold Player becomes On Hold when e says so in the Public
     Forum.

     An On Hold Player becomes Off Hold when e says so in the Public
     Forum; however, any attempt to do so within 96 hours after e last
     went On Hold is ineffective.

Amend Rule 1664 by removing the text "whose Location is the Beer Hall".

Amend Rule 1367 by adding this paragraph:

     "Granting a Degree" and "awarding a Degree" are synonymous.  A
     Player who has been awarded a Degree possesses that Degree.

Repeal Rule 1711.

ACK!

I hereby move to the Origin and go off hold.

I hereby cancel any votes I have cast on Proposal 3591.

I hereby cancel any votes I have cast on Proposal 3581.

I hereby move to the Statis Chamber and go on hold.

I will enjoy my two free VTs... wahoo... makes my day.

I'd like to note that I do not intend on returning off hold again until
things settle down in this neck of the woods.

I agree.  My recent Registrar's Report is therefore in error.  I will
be correcting it presently.

I hereby appeal the Judgement of CFJ 1065.

Judge Vlad tries to ignore the clear language of Rule 1006, by claiming
that it is phrased that way as "simply an assumption made by the Rule," and
is not a definition.

This is just another way of trying to mind-read the _intent_ of the Rule,
supposing that if the author had been "aware of the possible ramifications"
e might have worded it differently, and that we should follow that intent
as doing "least violence to the Rule."

In Agora we avoid considering legislative intent, and this criterion is
absent from the criteria of Judgement in Rule 214.  We try to play, and
judge, on the basis of what a given Rule says, not on what the person
writing it was thinking at the time.  Indeed, much of the interest of the
Game comes from seeing the application of a Rule in unforeseen
circumstances.

When a term is defined in the Rules, it is wrong to transplant the ordinary
real-life meaning of the term into the Game, to overrule the Rules. That is
what this Judgement is seeking to do.

Regards,
-- elJefe

I also call for the appeal of CFJ 1065. 

There is another reading here:

R790: winner of Election holds office.
R1006: office is a position held by Player 

Despite the fact that 790 takes precedence over 1006, 1006 seeks to
define what it is to be an Office, while 790 doesn't.  Therefore, I
think 790 implicitly yields to 1006, and Morendil wasn't elected to
the Speaker-Elect position at all, because he wasn't a Player at the
time of his winning the election.

In any case, I think the issues need to be examined again. 

Michael.

Before everyone starts "correcting" everything;

I was not comming off hold because I was re-registering.
Unless someone thinks non-Players can be on hold, I ceased being
on hold when I was deregistered.  I became Active when I registered.
This is a COE on the Cartographer's report unless the Cartographer
can give a reasonable expliantion why a new Player should appear
anywhere other than the Origin.

New Players should appear at the Welcoming Center, actually. :)

Voting has closed on these Proposals.  However, there remain open
disputes over who the Executors of certain Zombies are, and until
these disputes are settled, I intend to withhold the report of the
results, since it might affect the results, and I should not wish to
generate extra work for anyone by having to amend the reported
results.

Obviously, I will release the results prior to that resolution if it
is not promptly forthcoming; I encourage the various Judges and
Justices involved to act promptly, but not hastily, on the matters
before them.

Proto: Style Changes

I've dusted this one off and will re-submit it (with appropriate changes if
P-Notes are abolished).  I thought I should proto it again first, though, to
see if there are any new comments and to make sure Oerjan gets a chance to look
it over.  8)

The bracketed wording represents the changes I will make if P-Notes are
eliminated, preserving Kolja's exchange rate of 1 VT per 3 Style Points.  The
idea here is to make Style persistent and to give a reward only once for any
given increase in Style.

-- Crito

Amend Rule 1542 to read as follows:

      There are Entities known as Style Points.  All Players possess
      an integral number of Style Points that is positive, negative or
      zero.  The number of Style Points a Player has is that Player's
      Style. Any new Player, or a Player with no recorded Style
      Points, begins with a Style of zero.

      Each Player also has a High Style Mark.  Any new Player, or a
      Player with no recorded High Style Mark, begins with a High
      Style Mark of zero.

      Every time a Proposal is distributed, the Wizard has the option
      of changing the Style of the Player who submitted that Proposal,
      as long as that Player is not the Wizard.  The Wizard may only
      change the Style of Players whose Proposals were distributed
      after e became Wizard.

      The Wizard may add or subtract up to three Style Points from the
      Proposer's Style for any reason having to do with the form,
      content, effects, or nature of the Proposal-- but, for the
      change to have effect, such reasons must be included in eir
      Wizard's Report, as provided for in other Rules.

      Whenever a Player's Style points exceeds eir High Style Mark by
      two [three] or more points, the Wizard shall pay out to that Player a
      reward of one P-Note [VT] for every two [three] points in excess of eir
      current High Style Mark and eir High Style Mark shall be increased
      by two [three] times the number of P-Notes [VTs] awarded.

      A Player's Style and High Style Mark can only change as provided
      for in this Rule.

Amend Rule 1543 to read as follows:

      There is an Office of Wizard. The Official Report for the Office
      Wizard, or Wizard's Report, shall include:

         i) The Style of every Player.
        ii) The High Style Mark of every Player.
       iii) All Style changes, and the values of those changes, since
            the last Wizard's Report.
        iv) The change in Style, if any, merited by each Proposal
            distributed since the last Wizard's Report.
         v) The reasons for each change.

CFJ 1069

Judgement: TRUE

Reasoning & Arguments of Judge Swann;

My first impulse was to Judge this trivially True, because the caller 
was so set on having the Judgement made in a completely indeterminate 
state where we didn't know if Steve consents or not.  But, while having 
Steve consent skewers the motive behind the CFJ, I've come to realize 
that it doesn't make the Statement trivial, or any less interesting.

What we have here is a question about a transitional event.  These kind 
of events seem to be were a lot of the interesting matter happens, and 
many profound CFJs have ruled on what actually happens between point A 
and B. (The recent destruction of currencies is a case in point.)  
Therefore I intend to plumb the issue with an open mind.

The core question we have here is from Steve eimself, "when an Officer 
resigns and appoints a Player other than the Speaker to succeed em, and 
the other Player consents (as is the case here), when does the change of 
Office occur?"

The caller opines that Rule 880 requires a prediction of the future.  
Upon a careful reading of the rule, I think not.  The first sentence 
says;

     "An Officer is always permitted to resign from any Office e
      holds, provided e specifies another Player to succeed
      em, who then becomes the temporary holder of that Office."

That clearly installs the specified Player in the Office.  It is my 
opinion that the Rule makes the most sense if interpreted as a 
chronology of what happens when an Officer resigns (and appoints someone 
other than the Speaker);

     a) Sentence 1, the Office is held temporarily by the specified 
        Player and the resigning Player ceases to hold that Office.
     b) The Specified Player holds the Office temporarily until e 
        consents, refuses, or stays silent for seven days.
     c) If e doesn't consent, then Rule 880 invalidates the appointment.  
        This is I believe the most sensible interpretation of the Rule's  
        provisions.  The language of the Rule IMO, provides a 
        presumption of validity that holds until the Rule says 
        otherwise.  i.e. all appointments are valid until the Office is 
        refused or seven days without consent have passed.
     d) If the appointment is invalidated I believe that the sentence, 
        "An Officer who resigns without appointing a successor is deemed 
        to have appointed the Speaker to succeed em." can be justifiably 
        read as applying to the person refusing the Office, i.e. 
        Refusing an appointment is akin to resigning without specifying 
        a successor.  Reading events in this matter requires no 
        precognition, insures that the identity of the Officer in
        question is not inderterminate at any point, and renders the 
        verdict TRUE at the time the statement was made, whatever 
        Steve's decision had been.

Therefore I judge the Statement TRUE based on Common Sense and the best 
interests of the Game.




Evidence:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 880/4 (Power=1)
Resignation of Offices

      An Officer is always permitted to resign from any Office e
      holds, provided e specifies another Player to succeed
      em, who then becomes the temporary holder of that Office.  For
      this appointment to be valid, this Player must either explicitly
      and publically consent to becoming the new holder of that Office
      within seven days of such appointment, or be the Speaker.  The
      Speaker can be appointed to hold an Office temporarily without
      consenting, and may not refuse such an appointment.  An Officer
      who resigns without appointing a successor is deemed to have
      appointed the Speaker to succeed em.

      A change in the identity of the Speaker does not automatically
      cause the transfer of any Offices being held by the former
      Speaker to the new Speaker.

In order to Judge this CFJ I feel I need someone to provide me
with a rundown of the presumed events that led to Morendil 
becoming Speaker.  To wit, how did e become S-E, when.  How he
was deregistered, and when.  I also need info on any relevant
elections, the time of Nominations, the duration of the voting
periods and so on.

This is a reqyuest to all the officers who keep track of this stuff.

Swann,

Morendil's deregistration occurred on Tue, 14 Oct
1997 at 10:42:10 +0000 GMT.  This occurred as a
result of elJefe correctly alleging that Morendil
was Lawless at that time.
