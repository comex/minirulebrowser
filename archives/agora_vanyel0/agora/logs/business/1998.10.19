Proposal 3795 has passed, so true to my word, I hereby set the Voting
Tariff for all Proposals distributed from next week onwards, to be 0 VTs.
I will leave it at that level until Lee is able to produce an up-to-date
Accountor's Report, or one month's time, whichever is sooner.

This message contains one or more Proposals.  Each Proposal begins
immediately after a line marked "**START PROPOSAL" and ends
immediately before the first following line marked "**END PROPOSAL".

The following Proposal is to be titled "No Passing the Buck" and is to
have Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it therefore resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      (a) A Recordkeepor may elect to reject any Transfer Order or
          Payment Order, the amount of which is not specified by its
          Executor as a fixed numeral.

      (b) The actual numerical value of the amount of a Transfer or
          Payment Order whose amount was not specified by its Executor
          as a fixed numeral is whatever the Recordkeepor, in good
          faith, determines it to be at the time the Order was
          submitted.

      (c) For the purpose of this Rule, a "fixed numeral" is a
          numerical constant specified in a manner that the
          Recordkeepor may determine its value with definite certainty
          without referring to any information in the Game State other
          than the message itself.

[This is to prevent Players from stating that they "execute whatever
 Payment Orders they are required to execute" or "transfer all but two
 VTs to some entity", thereby transferring the responsibility to
 determine what they are legally required to do to Recordkeepors,
 and/or creating uncertainty in Currency Records by specifying
 contingent transfer amounts.]


**END PROPOSAL

The following Proposal is to be titled "Language shall be Plain" and
is to have Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it therefore resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      In the construction or interpretation of the Rules, all words
      and phrases shall be taken in their plain, or ordinary and
      usual, sense, except where doing so would be plainly repugnant
      to the context of those words or phrases.  Technical words and
      phrases having a peculiar and appropriate meaning shall be
      understood according to their technical import.


**END PROPOSAL

The following Proposal is to be titled "Some Housecleaning" and is to
have Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 408 be amended to read:

      (a) The Judge of an open CFJ is required to, within seven days of
          when that CFJ last became open or seven days of eir
          assignment to that CFJ, whichever is later, close that CFJ
          by dismissing or judging the CFJ and/or granting or denying
          any outstanding judicial motions pertaining to that CFJ.

      (b) The failure of a Judge to close a case within the prescribed
          time constitutes the Infraction of Judicial Tardiness and
          carries a penalty of one Blot for each day (or fraction
          thereof) that the case remains open beyond the permitted
          time.  This penalty is to be reported by the Clerk of the
          Courts.

      (c) The failure to observe this time limit does not, by itself,
          cause the delinquent Judge to be recused from the CFJ, nor
          does it invalidate eir judgment or dismissal of the CFJ or
          grant or denial of any related judicial motion which that
          Judge might submit after the limit has expired.

      (d) This Rule defers to any other Rule which prescribes a
          different time limit in which a CFJ must be closed, and to
          any other Rule which establishes procedures by which the
          time limit specified in this Rule may be extended or
          shortened.

[This is a slightly modified version of a rule I proposed last
 November, and which was adopted but clobbered by the contemporaneous
 adoption of another Proposal.]


**END PROPOSAL

The following Proposal is to be titled "Evidentiary Status of Officer
Reports" and is to have Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1768 be amended to read:

      (a) The published Report of an Officer, with respect to those
          matters reported therein which that Officer is required by
          law to report, shall be afforded the strongest evidentary
          weight.  Evidence of this nature shall be determinative in
          the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the
          contrary.

      (b) No challenge to the published Report of an Officer, with
          respect to those matters reported therein which that Officer
          is required by law to report, shall proceed unless:
          (1) it was been initiated within 21 days of the publication
              of that report; or
          (2) credible evidence that the Officer acted in bad faith,
              or acted in good faith upon information presented to em
              in bad faith, is presented.
