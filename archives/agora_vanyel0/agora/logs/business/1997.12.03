H. Recordkeepors, please note that according to 1748 I have to issue
payment orders for five Voting Tokens and two Proposal Notes from the
bank to me, because I proposed INP 351.

I just noticed that I have issued POs for the rewards in INP 351
earlier; therefore I vacate the above, duplicate POs. Sorry for the
confusion!

Comments:

3615:
I agree with some others that the Objects proposal needs some work.  The
fact that it clears away the entire Pragmatic Currencies apparatus is not
what troubles me; the fact that a single Officer can deregister every other
player for Lawlessness does.

{True, e might commit a Crime by doing so; but who would judge the CFJ
against em?  We do not have a legal principle that consequences of a crime
are nullified, so the deregistrations would stand.  And by the time anyone
was able to re-register, the Rules might look very different.}

3616:
Nonchallenge of Election results is a move towards crisis avoidance, and
extension of this principle into other areas would also be welcome.

3620 and 3621:
I have not yet made up my mind between these two.  I will attempt to do so
before the voting deadline, if it matters.

Regards,
-- elJefe

Proto-Proposal: Perpetual Offices

Create a new rule, entitled "Holding an Office in Perpetuity", with the
text:

   If a certain Office is held in the normal fashion by a Player,
   then the Registrar may declare Without Objection that the Office
   is held in perpetuity, until such time as the Player holding the
   Office changes. 

   The Term of Service of an Office held in perpetuity shall never
   expire.  

   This Rule takes precedence over other rules defining the expiry
   of an Office's Term of Service.

[v2 Changed the declaration to be Without Objection]
[v3 Changed Speaker to Registrar]

----

Chuck raised the question of whether an Office held in perpetuity is 
held in the normal fashion. Rule 790 appears to answer this directly:

Rule 790/6 (Power=1)
Filling Vacant Offices

      An Office is "held in the normal fashion" if and only if the
      Officer holding that Office was elected to that Office and has
      neither resigned from it nor been retired or removed from it.
      An Office which is not held in the normal fashion is said to be
      held temporarily.

      ...

This having been said, does anyone still feel that an extra sentence to 
the proposal to make this clear?

If there are no further objections, I will propose this next week.
