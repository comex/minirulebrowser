Is Andre's Judgement in?  As best I can figure, Andre's Judgement is
determinative, as the other two Justices have already submitted
opposing opinions.  His opinion was due about 2 hours ago, so either
it's in or we need a new Justice.

I need to know the outcome of this CFJ to determine the outcome of at
least one Proposal, so it would be helpful if this could be
expeditiously reported.  If Andre has defaulted, I will have to
publish a potentially erroneous report and hope for the best.

[Mad rantings snipped...]

When I read this I seriously considered for a moment to mint a new
currency called Experience Points and award some of them to Oerjan for
excellent role playing. But I think a simple Kudo transfer will also
serve the purpose of showing my appreciation for the fun Oerjan has
been spreading with eir M.Sci. nomination, so H. Herald please note, I
hereby transfer one Kudo from Calabresi, for behaving like a player on
hold without actually going on hold, to Oerjan for, well, behaving
like a really mad scientist.

Kolja A. (not sure whether I should be glad or regret not having voted
for Oerjan...)

I welcome the introduction of the Repeal-O-Matic. However, I see one
weakness in its concept: it only targets single rules. The Agora
ruleset is a rather complex system, though, and often the abolition of
a single rule makes no sense without some accompanying changes or even
repeals of other rules.

Why not allow the promotor to add such changes or repeals, to avoid
obviously disfunctional repeal proposals? 

For example, by adding the sentence:

If a rule picked by the promotor explicitly refers to other rules or
to concepts or entities that also appear in other rules, the promotor
is authorized, but not obliged, to add provisions to the Proposal that
leave the ruleset in a more consistent and functional state after the
repeal of the rule picked by the promotor.

H. Promotor Crito!

I hereby submit the following Proposal, paying the Petition Fee to do so.

####
Proposal
Electioneering and the Public Voting Experiment

[Comment: it occurs to me that during the Public Voting Experiment,
we might as well allow the Assessor to publish summaries of everyone's
votes, since votes are being sent to the PF anyway.] 

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 452 be amended by replacing in it
the text which currently reads:

      This Rule shall in no way prohibit the Vote Collector from
      posting, at any time and to the Public Forum, a list of those
      Voting Entities which have already voted or declared that they
      are Present on a given Proposal, Election or Referendum, as
      long as e does not indicate specifically whether the Voting
      Entity has voted or declared Presence. Doing so is not a Crime,
      unless specified as such by another Rule.

with text which reads:

      This Rule shall in no way prohibit the Vote Collector from
      posting, at any time and to the Public Forum, a list of those
      Voting Entities which have already voted or declared that they
      are Present on a given Proposal, Election or Referendum. If a
      vote or declaration of Presence has already appeared in the
      Public Forum prior to the publication of such a list, then the
      Vote Collector is permitted to indicate how the Voting Entity
      has voted, or whether it has declared itself Present. Otherwise,
      the Vote Collector is prohibited from specifically indicating
      whether the Voting Entity has voted, or declared Presence. The
      publication of a list as described in this Rule is not a Crime,
      unless specified as such by another Rule.

Swann presently owes the Bank 2 P-Notes (orders POP051, POP052), and
the Bank owes him 2 P-Notes (POP059).  He therefore had both Debtors
and Creditors at the moment you purported to end eir Probate; your
claim that he had no Debtors and no Creditors is thus erroneous.
(There may be others I have missed.)  I hereby Claim Error.  I also
Claim Error in your claim that Swann's Probate has been properly
completed.

I am further offended at the shirking of your duties as an Executor in
Probate that is inherent in your election to specify your actions so
as to pass the computational duties onto the various Recordkeepors.  I
therefore transfer one Kudo from Steve, for passing the buck, to
Crito, as one of the two people to whom that buck was unfairly passed.

Oops.  That should be 0.9 VT, in possession of Larry Wall.

The previous attempt to transfer 3.0 VT from Larry Wall to the Bank
failed.  As Chancellor, I do now cause the transfer of 0.9 VTs from
Larry Wall to the Bank.

Claims admitted. Before I act to end Swann's probate properly, I
hereby request of all Currency Recordkeepors details of Swann's
present holdings of Currencies, and any outstanding Payment Orders
naming Swann as Payor or Payee.

Ah, right.  I guess I better make the claim that this message was in error
since Blob was not reregistered at that time.  This is a COE which I admit. 
The above Payment Order is hereby vacated.  Blob's Fugitive Blots were not
destroyed.
