As it seems to be impossible for a proposer to amend proposals in the 
queue.  I'll propose a a new proposal.

This message contains exactly one Proposal.  The Proposal begins
immediately after the line marked "**START PROPOSAL" and ends at the
end of the message.

The following Proposal is to be titled "Power to the Senate: take two" 
and is to have Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL

Let it there fore be resolved that rule 1717 be amended to read:

There exist Nomic entities know as Senators, there also exists a Nomic 
entity known as the Senate.  Some Players are Senators.  The Senate is 
the set of all Senators.  Only Senators are members of the Senate.

Only players may be senators.  If a Senator is removed from the Senate, 
e ceases to be a Senator.  

A Player who has been registered continuously for the immediately 
preceding two months becomes a Senator, if and only if e has not been a 
Senator at any point during those two months.

There are always at least three Senators.  If at any point there is less 
than three Senators, the registered player, who is not a Senator, and 
who has not been a Senator for the longest period of time amongst the 
registered players, becomes a Senator.  If it is impossible to tell 
which player has not been a Senator for the longest period of time, then 
all players, who arguable share the longest period of time not being a 
Senator, become Senators.

Any Senator may choose to remove themselves from the Senate, by stating 
so in a public forum.



Create a new rule titled "Senator Suggestions" with the following title:

A Senate Suggestion is a piece of text sent to a public forum by a 
Senator.  It must state clearly that it is a Senate Suggestion and 
contain a valid Suggestion, or it fails to be a Senate Suggestion.

Only Senators may make Senate Suggestions.  Senate Suggestions may be 
made only as defined by the rules.  A Senate Suggestion must contain all 
the information needed, as defined by the rules, or it fails to be a 
Senate Suggestion.

Any Senator may object to a Senate Suggestion, by making a Senator 
Objection.  Senate Objections must be made in a public forum, making 
clear the suggestion they object to, and that in fact the text is a 
Senator Objection.



Create a new rule titled "Senate Powers" with the following text:

A Senator may make a Senate Suggestion, that a registered player becomes 
a Senator.  To do so there must be a clear indication of the intended 
player in the Suggestion.  The player becomes a Senator one week after 
the suggestion, unless there is a Senator Objection to the suggestion 
within the week.

A Senator may make a Senate Suggestion, that a Senator is removed from 
the Senate.  To do so there must be a clear indication of the intended 
Senator in the Suggestion.  The Senator is removed from the Senate one 
week after the suggestion, unless there are at least 2 Senator 
Objections to the suggestion within the week.



Create a rule titled "Senate Proposals" with the following text:

At any time during a Proposal's Voting Period, a Senator may make it a 
Senate Proposal, by stating so in the Public Forum.  If that does not 
happen, the Proposal is not a Senate Proposal.  

A Senator may object to the proposal becoming a Senate Proposal by 
stating so in the public forum during the Proposal’s Voting Period, in 
which case the proposal ceases to be a Senate Proposal, and returns to 
its previous state.

If a Senator objects to a proposal Senate Proposal, that Proposal may 
not become a Senate proposal again.

Entities other than Senators cannot vote on Senate Proposals. If an 
Entity other than a Senator has already voted on a Proposal by the time 
it becomes a Senate Proposal, eir votes on that Proposal are cancelled, 
these votes remain canceled even if the Proposal reverts from being a 
Senate Proposal.
