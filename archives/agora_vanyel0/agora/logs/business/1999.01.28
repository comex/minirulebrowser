H. Promotor G. Chaos,

I hereby submit the following Proposal, paying 2 P-Notes to raise its
Priority to 2.


####
Proposal
Clearing the ground

[Comment: I very much want to employ a distinction between Legislators
and Voters in my forthcoming Separation of Powers proto. But there's a
snag: the term "Voters" is already used in Rules 103, 112 and 1043, with
the meaning "Players other than the Speaker" - an archaism left over
from the long distant days when the Speaker was not allowed to vote.
So, to clear away the terminological ground for A Separation of Powers,
I make the following Proposal.]

This Proposal shall have an Adoption Index of 3.

Be it hereby resolved that R103 have its Title changed to "The Speaker
may not deregister", and that it be amended to read:

      At any time, there is exactly one Player who is the Speaker. The
      Speaker may not deregister or be deregistered for any reason, any
      other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.


Be it further resolved that R113 (Players may always opt out) be amended
by replacing the phrase "A Player" with the phrase "A Player other than
the Speaker".

[Since the Proposal has an AI of 3 anyway, I've taken the opportunity to
iron out some of the wrinkles in the Rules about the Speaker and
deregistration. At present, the wise policy of preventing the Speaker
from deregistering is enforced indirectly by R103, and only then because
that Rule takes precedence over R113 in case of a conflict, which there
would be if the Speaker ever tried to claim eir right to deregister
under R113.]

Be it further resolved that R112 be amended by deleting from it the
paragraph which reads:

      If no other Rule defining a way to Win exists, then a Player
      Wins upon each Winter and Summer Solstice, and upon each Vernal
      and Autumnal Equinox, with the Winner being chosen randomly by
      the Speaker from among all Voters not on Hold who are not
      ineligible to Win because of an applicable Win-preventing Rule.

[This provision was inserted over 3 years ago, when winning still
triggered a Speaker transition. With regular quarterly Speaker
Transitions now in place, we can get rid of it.]

Be it further resolved that R1043 (Deregistration) be amended to read:

      A Player other than the Speaker may deregister from Agora by
      sending a message to the Public Forum announcing eir
      deregistration. A Player who deregisters in this fashion ceases to
      be a Player effective at the time date-stamped on that message,
      and any attempts by em to reregister before thirty days have
      passed are without effect. This Rule takes precedence over Rules
      which would cause em to be reregistered before thirty days have
      passed after eir deregistration.

[I've made another slight change here: "before thirty days have passed"
has replaced "before the beginning of the next month". I cannot see why
a player who deregisters voluntarily near the end of a month should be
treated any differently from one who does so near the beginning.]

Proto-proposal: Changing the Bar Height v1.1

Create a rule, with title "The Priority Bar", and text:

      (a) The Priority Bar is the minimum Priority needed for a 
          Proposal to be distributed. It is an integer multiple of 
          the MUQ of P-Notes, lying between zero and two inclusive.

      (b) Upon the adoption of the proposal which created this rule,
          its value shall be set to one.


      (c) The Promotor may change the value of the Priority Bar by
          announcing its new value in the Public Forum, provided that
          the new value is within the range allowed by subdivision (a)
          of this Rule.

      (d) Whenever a new value is announced according to subdivision
          (c) of this Rule, the new value takes effect at the
          beginning of the next Nomic Week, unless the announcement is
          made within three days of the end of the current Nomic Week,
          in which case the new value takes effect at the beginning of
          the Nomic Week following the next Nomic Week.

Amend Rule 1036 by replacing the text:

      A Proposal's Priority is an integer value. All Proposals
      initially have a Priority of zero.

with:

      A Proposal's Priority is an integer multiple of the MUQ of
      P-Notes. All Proposals initially have a Priority of zero.

Amend Rule 1771 to read:

      A Player may increase or decrease the Priority of a Proposal
      in the Queue by announcing to the Public Forum that e does so,
      and paying a number of P-Notes to the Bank. 

      The Priority of the Proposal is increased or decreased, as 
      specified by the Player making the payment, by an amount equal
      to the number of P-Notes transferred to the Bank, provided 
      that this transfer is not executed for any other purpose.

Amend Rule 1770 by replacing the text:

      If the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue with a
      Priority greater than zero is less than or equal to the Batch
      Size, then the batch shall consist of all such Proposals.

      If the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue is greater
      than the Batch Size, then the batch shall consist of those
      Proposals in the Queue with the highest Priority such that the
      number of Proposals distributed is equal to the Batch Size.

with:

      If the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue with a
      Priority greater than or equal to the Priority Bar is less than 
      or equal to the Batch Size, then the batch shall consist of all 
      such Proposals.

      Otherwise, the batch shall consist of those Proposals in the 
      Queue with the highest Priority such that the number of 
      Proposals distributed is equal to the Batch Size.

Amend Rule 1701 by replacing the text:

      The MUQ of P-Notes is 1.

with

      The MUQ of P-Notes is 0.1.

[Comments:

v1.1 - Changed references to "real numbers" to "integer multiples of
       the MUQ of P-Notes". It's a pity clumsy, but it's probably 
       safer.
]
