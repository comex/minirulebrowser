Go for it.  You're the next Silly Person.  (The rules are unclear in
this case whether this means this week or next week.)

Or, charge a penalty for when a SP fails to designate the next SP, and
THEN send it to the Speaker.

This Week with R-O-M

I show the Rule set as having 291 Rules.  My random number generator spit out
the following five numbers:

 44 = Rule 1555 Retirement and Removal from Offices
194 = Rule 1599 Failure to Execute Payment Orders
 22 = Rule 1482 Precedence Between Rules with Unequal Power
114 = Rule  889 Clerk of the Courts
 27 = Rule 1677 Currency Awards for New Players

Hmm.  Well here's one for Steve.  Screwing up the precedence relationships may
offer some interesting opportunities.  This week's selection then is Rule 1482.
Let's see if this has any chance at all.  8)

I would like to state that if I had only 5 Votes I probably wouldn't have
made a second AGAINST Vote on 3681.  I consider counteracting the great
Scam potential in 3681 to be a charitable cause, and so I consider the
second Vote to be part of the 36 VTs I myself scammed :-)

Greetings,
Ørjan.

Not that he deserves it - he obviously didn't read the Rules ;-)

I am offering to buyback Quorum on Proposals in exchange
for VTs.  I will consider any offer that seems reasonable.

I've added an amendment to R1547 to remove the last of the confusing
language about 'casting Voting Tokens'. Votes are cast; Voting Tokens
are spent.

Having now read Scott's Omnibus Reform Proposal, I see that he has dealt
with the same territory there covered here, including Michael's
suggestion of suspending the voting privileges of Players who fail to
pay for their votes, a suggestion I really like. Ideally I'd like
just to add the parts of Omnibus Reform which deal with suspension to
my proto, but these depend on the broader framework of Judicial
Orders set out in Scott's proto. So I think the best course is to
persist with my proto, and wait for Omnibus Reform to add suspension
of voting priveleges.

I'm persisting with my separate proto because Omnibus Reform deals
with so many other matters, whereas I'm interested chiefly in just
this one at the moment.


####
Proto-Proposal
Split the Assessor's functions

[Comment: a proto to split the two functions of the Assessor - tallying
votes and VT Recordkeeping - into two separate Offices. The major change
that this entails is to the way voting is handled. I've tried to keep
things as simple as possible, by loosening the link between voting and
spending VTs. Under the system I propose, voting results in being billed
for VTs, but voting is not a dual act of both casting a vote, and 
spending VTs accordingly. Compare my proposed R1442 to the current
version to see the advantages of this approach.] 

[Summary: this Proposal creates 1 Rule, repeals 2 Rules (1731, 1653), and
amends 6 Rules (1449, 1696, 1442, 206, 1717, 1547).]

This Proposal has an AI of 2.

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "The Accountor", be created
with the following text:

      There is an Office of Accountor, whose Salary is 1.5 times the
      Basic Officer Salary, and whose responsibility it is to be the 
      Recordkeepor for Voting Tokens. The Accountor's Report includes
      the number of Voting Tokens possessed by each entity which
      possesses them, and any changes thereto since the last posting
      of the Accountor's Report.

Be it further resolved that the Office of Accountor shall initially
be held by the Assessor.

Be it further resolved that R1449 (The Assessor) be amended by replacing
the text "3 times the Basic Officer Salary" with the text "1.5 times the
Basic Officer Salary".

Be it further resolved that R1696 (Voting Tokens) be amended to read:

      Voting Tokens (VTs) are a Currency.  The MUQ of VTs is 0.1.
      The Recordkeepor for VTs is the Accountor.  The Mintor of
      VTs is the Bank.

Be it further resolved that R1442 (Using VTs) have its Title changed
to 'Voting and Voting Tokens', and that it be amended to read:

      A Voting Entity votes upon a Proposal when, during the Voting 
      Period of that Proposal, e informs the Assessor of the vote or 
      votes e is casting upon that Proposal, provided that e is 
      authorized to vote on that Proposal. A Voting Entity may inform the 
      Assessor that e casts no votes on a Proposal, and doing so cancels 
      any votes e has previously cast on that Proposal, if this is done 
      during the Voting Period of that Proposal. Cancelled votes are not 
      counted by the Assessor and do not count towards Quorum.

      As soon as possible after the end of the Voting Period of a
      Proposal, the Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity one Voting
      Token for each uncancelled vote cast by that Voting Entity on
      that Proposal. In the case where a Voting Entity has cast more
      than one vote on a Proposal, or a Voting Entity has cast votes
      on more than one Proposal, the results of which the Assessor
      has published at the same time, the Assessor is permitted to
      bill the Voting Entity for an amount of Voting Tokens
      equivalent to all the uncancelled votes cast by the Voting
      Entity on those Proposals, instead of billing the Voting Entity
      once for each uncancelled vote e cast.

Be it further resolved that R1731 (Implicit Transfer Orders) be repealed.

[Comment: no longer needed.]

Be it further resolved that R206 (Voting Entities and Votes) be amended 
by deleting from it the text:

      The casting of any votes may only be achieved by the casting of 
      Voting Tokens, as specified in other Rules.

Be it further resolved that R1717 (The Senate) be amended by replacing
the text in which currently reads:

      If any Entity other than a Senator has already Voted on a
      Proposal by the time it becomes a Senate Proposal, their Votes
      on that Proposal change to ABSTAIN, and cannot change
      thereafter, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, and at the
      end of the Voting Period, the cost of casting those Votes is
      transferred to them.

with text which reads:

      If an Entity other than a Senator has already voted on a
      Proposal by the time it becomes a Senate Proposal, eir votes
      on that Proposal are cancelled.

Be it further resolved that R1653 (Groups and Unity Vote) be repealed.

[Comment: a rarely used white elephant not worth saving.]

Be it further resolved that R1547 (Some Organizations Can Cast VTs)
be amended to read:

      If an Organization is a Voting Entity then it is permitted to
      cast votes on Proposals as if it were a Player. Such votes are
      cast by the Organization's Executor, acting on behalf of the
      Organization.

I hereby pay the Petition Fee to submit the following Proposal.
