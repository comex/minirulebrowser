Proto:  Plots (v1.1)


[Part Zero:  Authorship.]

The Rulekeepor shall list Harlequin, Blob and Antimatter as Authors of
each Rule created or amended by this Proposal.


[Part One:  Rename Locations to Plots.  Discard Entities having
 Locations and Moving.]

Amend Rule 1706 to read:

     There is a class of Entities called Plots.  Each Plot has a unique
     name.  The Agoraverse is the set of all Plots.

     A Plot is Rule-Named if and only if it is referred to by name in
     the Rules.

     The Cartographor is authorized to change any non-Rule-Named Plot's
     name Without Objection.

Repeal Rule 1707.

Amend Rule 1708 to read:

     Two Plots may be Adjacent to each other.  No Plot is Adjacent to
     itself.

Repeal Rule 1709.

[Rule 1710 will be amended later.]


[Part Two:  Create land ownership.]

Create a Rule titled "Landowners" with this text:

     Each non-Rule-Named Plot has an Executor, known as its Owner; each
     such Plot's initial Owner is the Mint.

     Rule-Named Plots never have an Executor or Owner.

Create a Rule titled "Buying Land" with this text:

     A Plot's Owner may sell that Plot to another entity by informing
     the Cartographor of eir mutual agreement to do so.

     An entity may purchase a Plot from the Mint by paying at least
     4 VTs to the Mint for the sole purpose of buying that Plot.

Create a Rule entitled "Winning by Ownership" with this text:

     Owning at least half of all Plots is a Winning Condition known as
     a Win by Ownership.


[Part Three:  Create something to do with the Plots you own]

Create a Rule entitled "Mules" with this text:

     Mules are a Currency.  Their MUQ is 1.  Their Recordkeepor is the
     Cartographor.

     A Mule's Owner may transfer that Mule to any Plot e owns by
     executing a Transfer Order of one Mule from emself to that Plot,
     unless the Plot already possesses a Mule.

     A Mule's Owner may remove it from its Plot by executing a Transfer
     Order of one Mule from that Plot to emself.

Create a Rule entitled "Energy" with this text:

     Energy is a currency.  Its MUQ is 1.  Its Recordkeepor is the
     Cartographor.

The Mint has 100 Mules and 10000 units of Energy.

Amend Rule 1677 to read:

     Upon the start of a Player's Grace Period, the Registrar shall
     pay out to that Player an award of 5 Voting Tokens, 5 P-Notes,
     5 Mules, and 20 units of Energy.

Amend Rule 1701 by removing this paragraph:

     Whenever there exists a Player who has never before possessed
     any P-Notes, the Promotor shall pay out 5 P-Notes to that Player.

Each current Player gains 5 Mules and 20 units of Energy.

Create a Rule entitled "Structures" with this text:

     Any Mule within a Plot may become a Structure (unless it is one
     already) when its Owner pays the price of that type of Structure
     to the Mint.  Unless otherwise specified, the price is 4 units of
     Energy.

     A type of Structure exists only if the Rules explicitly define it.

     The following types of Structures exist:

       * Farms
       * Houses
       * Mines
       * Churches

     A Structure ceases to be a Structure when its Owner informs the
     Cartographor that it does so, or when it is no longer within a
     Plot.  At that time, its Owner receives half the price of that
     type of Structure, rounded down.

Create a rule titled "Upkeep on Structures" with this text:

     Monthly upkeep on Structures is equal to 2 units of Energy for the
     first Structure of each type, plus 1 unit of Energy for each
     additional Structure, except as otherwise specified.

     If an Owner does not pay the upkeep on all of eir Structures
     within one week of the beginning of the month, all of eir
     Structures collapse and are destroyed.

Create a rule titled "Production from Structures" reading:

     At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall pay
     out each Structure's Production to its Owner.  Unless otherwise
     specified, each Structure's Production is as follows:

       * Farms - 5 VT
       * Houses - 1 P-Note
       * Mines - 1 unit of Energy

     Churches have no Production.  However, each Church is considered
     to be two players for the purposes of randomly allocating
     Indulgences, and any Indulgences which would be given to a Church
     are instead given to its Owner.

Create a new Rule titled "Proximity of Plots" and this text:

     A Farm's Production is increased by 0.3 VT for each House or
     Church to which it is Adjacent, and decreased by 1 VT for each
     Mine to which it is Adjacent.

     A House's Production is increased by 1 P-Note for every 2 Farms
     to which it is Adjacent.

     A Mine's Production is increased by 1 unit of Energy for every
     two Houses to which it is Adjacent, and decreased by 1 unit of
     Energy for every two Farms to which it is Adjacent.


[Part Four:  Amend the Rule defining the Cartographor and eir duties]

Amend Rule 1710 to read:

     There is an Office of Cartographor. The Cartographor recieves a 
     salary equal to 2 times the Basic Officer Salary.

     At least once each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall post a 
     Report to the Public Forum containing the following information:

       * all Plots, and which Plots are Adjacent to which others
       * the Ownership of all Plots
       * all changes in Plot Ownership since the last Report (if any)
       * the ownership and location of all Mules
       * the ownership of all units of Energy
       * all Transfer Orders and Payment Orders specifying Mules or
         units of Energy since the last Report (if any)
       * what type of Structure (if any) each Mule is
       * all cases of a Mule becoming or ceasing to be a Structure

H. Chancellor, please note:

Based on the mint authority granted to my by 1579, and with this
message, I create a new currency with the following properties:

Name: Koljenka (abbreviation Kj)
Mintor: Kolja A.
Recordkeepor: Kolja A.
MUQ: 1


The idea behind this currency is simple:

I would like to try an experiment concerning economy within
Agora. Instead of "MUDding" within Agora, with resources, plots,
locations and the like, I'd like to stay within the more abstract
framework of the nomic essentials. 

As has been remarked before, there are few things of real value within
a nomic; mostly the ability of players to perform or not perform
relevant actions. So I'll try to get a currency going based on some
actions I can control: my votes. You can return Koljenkas to me to
influence my votes on proposals.


The procedure for this is:


1. You approach me (preferably in a private mail;), stating how you'd
want me to vote.


2. I'll reply telling you whether I can follow your wish, and stating
how much it will cost you.


There are four possible reasons why I might not follow your wish at
this stage: 

2.1. You or I cannot afford it, e.g. you only have one Kj and I have
not voted yet (for prices see below). I will know that because I'm the
Recordkeepor for Kj's. Similarly, I might not be able to afford the
desired vote because I'm out of VTs.

2.2. Someone else was faster than you and had a different wish. 

2.3. I feel very strongly that I want to vote in a certain way. In
this case I will recompense you by transferring 4 Kj's to you after
the relevant voting period (2 Kj's if you wanted me to vote against a
proposal I proposed myself). 

In my own interest I will try very hard not to let this happen, as it
will reduce the value of Koljenkas considerably. In fact, I might not
have mentioned this possibility at all; but I thought I'd rather be
honest and state publically what I'll do in such situations. In fact,
that's my interest in this experiment: seeing whether I can get this
currency to work based on trust, not enforcable rules.

2.4. I will refuse your offer if I feel you are using it to scam or
cheat me (scams against others are ok :) - e.g. you ask me to vote
against my own proposal just to collect the 2 KJ's recompense if I
refuse. Again, I will try to do this as rarely as possible.


Depending on the situation, the whole thing will cost you the
following amounts:

i) if I haven't yet voted on the proposal: 2 Kj

ii) if I have voted on the proposal the way you want: 1 Kj (of
course this only makes sense if I have voted privately. But as long as
that is legal, I usually do. Come to think of it, you may even want to
pay this 1 Kj if I have voted in public, to keep others from changing
my vote with a different wish - see 2.2 above.)

iii) if I have declared my presence, but you want me to vote FOR or
AGAINST: 2 Kj

iv) if i have voted FOR or AGAINST, and you want me to change my vote:
3 Kj

v) if you want me to cast a double vote (2 FOR or 2 AGAINST): 
above, plus 3 Kj.


3. I vote accordingly.


4. At the end of the voting period of the proposal, you transfer the
agreed amount of Koljenkas to me.


Alternatively I will always offer to buy back Kjs at a rate of one VT
for 2 KJs, provided that my VT supply doesn't drop below 3 VTs because
of this.


You realize, of course, that the value of the Kj's is based on trust
and on my reliability. As I will want to buy things for my Kj's, I'll
try hard to keep their value up. But there are no formal guarantees
(just as I don't have a guarantee that you'll pay after I have voted
according to your wish). And I do retain the right to change these
conditions at will.


If this works, one might try to generalize the concept. E.g. one could
create a contest (or use another legal framework) with a currency and
similar regulations and have a group of players, not just a single
individual, backing the currency.


Kolja A.


P.S. Remark on the prices/MUQ: I had intended to make 1 Koljenka
equivalent to one vote of mine, but then the price for ii) and iv)
would have involved half Kj's, and I wanted to have an MUQ of one. So
now it's basically one vote for two Kj's as a base.

Was VT1025 possibly due to my Failure to Report Infraction?  If so, I'm
pretty sure I issued a Transfer Order for that, using language along the
lines of "I do whatever is necessary to pay these fines to the maximum

This is a COE.

    elJefe commits the Infraction of Persistent Indebtedness and is hereby

-------------------------------------------------------------------

in that elJefe had no outstanding Payment Orders at the time and therefore
did not commit the said Infraction.

This is a Claim of Error with respect to POI016.

If the claim is accepted, I ask the Herald to vacate POI016 under Rule 1733.

Yeah, they were, and I really intended to get a degree or two, but it was 
right after those proposals were accepted that I lost internet access for 
a while and when I came back I didn't have time... but now, hey, i have 
plenty of time... after all, it's just Princeton... :)

The only question in my mind is whether the results of CFJ940 can have
"retroactive" effect.  That is, it clearly forces Officers to regard only
certain forms of messages as POs from this point on, but does it invalidate the
past decisions of Officers to treat other forms of messages as POs?  I suspect
the answer is yes, but I had hoped to get a decision from the Courts on my
latest CFJ regarding this before making any adjustments.  As it is, I would
like to get a few opinions on this before officially replying to elJefe's COEs.

This just failed Quorum last time, so here is it again.

H. Promotor Crito,

I hereby submit the following Interested Proposal, paying the Petition
Fee to do so.

####
Proposal 
A Public Voting Experiment

WHEREAS voting in Agora's long history has traditionally been by
secret ballot, and whereas it is well known to psephologists that
subtle changes in the mechanics of voting can have interesting
effects, we, the Voting Entities of Agora, do hereby resolve to conduct
the following Public Voting Experiment for the duration of a trial two-
month period, and to that end further resolve that a Rule, entitled
"A Public Voting Experiment", be created with the following text:

      Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
      any votes by Voting Entities on Proposals, Elections or Referenda,
      may only be achieved by sending a message to the Public Forum.

      This Rule shall repeal itself 60 days after it is created.

####
