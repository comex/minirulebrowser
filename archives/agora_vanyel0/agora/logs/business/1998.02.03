1/26  Jester creates a Currency named "Jester's Ode Favores".

1/27  Sherlock designates emself the Silly Person.

1/29  Sherlock designates Jester the next Silly Person.

1/30  General Chaos and Oerjan transfer 100 and 36 VTs, respectively,
        to the Bank.  Per Rule 1754 (and Rule 1763), they will get
        these VTs back, despite the adoption of Proposal 3674.

      Sherlock attempts to declare a Paradox:  All VTs were destroyed
        by Proposal 3674, but the Bank is required to transfer VTs to
        the Players.  This doesn't work, for several reasons:
          * Agora has no "Win by Paradox" Rule.
          * The Bank is still able to Mint new VTs.
          * Rules 114 and 1698 prevent Gamestate changes that would
              crash the Game from occurring.

2/1   Read the Ruleset Week begins.

 Honorable Rulekeepor,

  Let it be known that at 10:11 PM Eastern time on February 3rd in the
year of our Lord 1998, I finished reading through the Ruleset, an
endeavour that resulted in both the expenditure of six aspirin tablets
and time that should have been spent on my thesis.  As a result, I
would appreciate my reward "as soon as possible", whatever that
means.  Thank you for your time and generosity in supporting such a
noble cause as "Read the Ruleset Week".  May the Force be with you.
