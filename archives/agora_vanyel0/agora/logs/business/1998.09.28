This is all a bit trees falling over in forests and no-one hearing
them, but if Murphy sent a message that no-one received, then does it
count as being a post to the PF?  I don't think so.  If not, then the
Election can hardly be said to have been announced then.  Rather, I
believe that the post announcing the message was actually sent at the
later time.  (This issue also affects the question of whether or not
Murphy managed to nominate for Notary.)

In any case, I deny the COE and encourage you to CFJ if you feel that
the issue needs further exploration.

The second version of this you saw, did actually go through
agora-business (take a look at the Sender line), but this was far from
clear.  This attached version is another denial of the same COE, and
this should appear unambiguously to the PF.

Proto: Indulgence tax after successful rebellion.

You may all have noticed that the last rebellion cancelled lots of
blots, but left all indulgences in circulation. I think this is a very
unbalanced situation - indulgences should be really scarce.

I'd like to remedy this by requiring an indulgence tax to be levied
after a successful rebellion. I am making the Registrar levy the tax
instead of the Herald to keep all post-rebellion duties in one hand.

I would prefer a tax rate of more than 50% for this particular
purpose, say 75%. But unfortunately the 50% limit is a hard limit set
by the generic tax rule, R1853. Would you support removing this limit
and putting it into the individual tax rules? This would require
making the VT tax level more explicit in R1852, of course.

I also wonder whether a simple requirement like "The Registrar shall
levy the following tax..." is sufficient to "empower" the Registrar to
levy this tax in the sense of R1853? Then the new text for R1664 could
be kept shorter.

Another question: Is the Title of Robespierre awarded automatically
and instantaneously? I assume it is, but if it isn't, the tax
exemption for the new Robespierre becomes more complicated.

Following Steve's example, I've appended a few minor tweaks concerning
another issue, Internomic.

Here is the proto:


1. Introduce the tax

Amend R1664 by inserting the text

         - The Registrar is empowered and required to levy a tax of 
           50% on indulgences. The holder of the Patent Title 
           "Robespierre" is exempt from this tax, even if other rules
           don't allow tax exemptions.

after the existing text

         - The Registrar shall pay out 2 VTs to each Rebellious
           Player.


2. Levy a one-off indulgence tax

Create a new rule with the text

 As soon as possible after the creation of this rule, the Herald shall
 levy a tax of 50% on indulgences.

 This rule is automatically repealed two weeks after it is created.


Appendix: Small, and hopefully uncontroversial IN fixes, appended to
this proposal to save money.

A1. Reduce the IN awards to realistic levels.

Amend R1748 by replacing the text

       ii) In the case where the InterNomic Proposal fails, but Agora
           did vote FOR it, the award shall be one Voting Token.
      iii) In the case where the InterNomic Proposal passes, the award
           shall be five Voting Tokens and two Proposal Notes.

with 

       ii) In the case where the InterNomic Proposal fails, but Agora
           did vote FOR it, the award shall be 0.5 Voting Tokens.
      iii) In the case where the InterNomic Proposal passes, the award
           shall be one Voting Token and one Proposal Note.


A2. Allow the ambassador to vote on uninteresting/uncontroversial IN
proposals.

Amend R1632 by replacing the text

      If the Referendum on that Proposal is
      undecided, then the Ambassador may decide how Agora votes,
      as e sees fit.

with 

      If the Referendum on that Proposal is undecided or has not 
      reached quorum, then the Ambassador may decide how Agora votes,
      as e sees fit.
