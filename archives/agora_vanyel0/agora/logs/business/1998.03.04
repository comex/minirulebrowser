PROBATE
-------


OFFICES
-------

All times are in GMT.

Recent Election winners:
  Accountor           - Crito, General Chaos; nominations close 3/6
  Archivist           - Steve (tie broken by Speaker Steve)
  Assessor            - General Chaos (re-Elected by Acclamation)
  Chancellor          - General Chaos (tie broken by Speaker Steve)
  Clerk of the Courts - elJefe (re-Elected)
  Commander-in-Chief  - Steve
  Justiciar           - Morendil
  Notary              - Murphy (re-Elected)
  Promotor            - Blob
  Registrar           - Michael leads Swann (5 to 1); voting ends 3/6
  Scorekeepor         - General Chaos (tie broken by Speaker Steve)
  Wizard              - Steve

It is notable that all but two of the contested Elections were won by
the Threat Nominee.

3/3  Sherlock calls for the Impeachment of ten Offices (plus the
       Speakership, which isn't an Office).  This begins a Referendum
       for each Office.  However, the Ruleset does not define any
       effect of being Impeached.


INTERNOMIC
----------

2/24  INP 360 is adopted.

      Agora will vote for INP 363.

3/2   INPs 361 and 362 are rejected.


OTHER
-----

2/23  Time Agent Rebels.

2/27  Jester COEs the Ruleset twice, on the grounds that two Proposals
        of the form "the following Rule changes do not occur" were
        rejected, therefore the Rule changes in question occur.  Both
        COEs are denied, on the grounds that rejected Proposals have
        Power=3D0 and thus cannot cause Rule changes.

3/3   Kolja A. and Harlequin Rebel.  Unless more Players register or a
        Rebel becomes Abiding, this will trigger another Revolt on
        March 13.

Herald Crito!

I hereby transfer a Kudo 
 FROM Steve, for grumbling about and taking far too seriously what I
             thought was an amusing bit of political rhetoric
 TO Kolja A, for producing the self-same political rhetoric.

In all the Impeachment Referenda in which I can vote, I vote AGAINST.

Speaking for myself, I don't think I've done anything to deserve removal
from Office. I have tried to run the Clerk's office efficiently and to
deliver fair and clear judgements when called upon, and I believe I've done
a good job.  I ask Agorans (or at least more than 1/3 of them) to vote
AGAINST the Impeachment referendum for CotC (and indeed AGAINST all of
them).

On 3698 : present.
On 3704 : absent.
On 3709 : absent.
On 3710 : against, twice.
On 3713 : absent.

Voters please note : 3710 can be defeated. We can count on all 4
Threat members, plus Swann, voting FOR. Grand total is 18 Votes, plus
the Threat's Group Vote, which is 19. If opposition is unanimous, we
should have 11x2 = 22 AGAINST votes, to which we might add the Order
of the Evil Eye's Vote. Given the turnout in the recent Elections, 
there's hope yet.

If you would like to Vote AGAINST but don't have enough VTs, I can 
lend you some.

One more group might help as well; I hereby announce the creation of 
the following Application to form a Group :
---
Upon Execution of this Application, a Group with the name
'Opposition Party' shall be formed, the Ordinances of which shall 
consist of the appended text, the membership of which shall consist 
of all the signatories.
Ordinances :
* The Vizier and Ordinancekeepor shall be Morendil
* These Ordinances shall not be modified except by unanimous consent 
   of all members
* The Group shall be dissolved upon unanimous consent by all members
---

If enough Players are interested in joining the above, that will be 
one more AGAINST vote.

Whoops, I'm wrong.  It's still there, though it should have been repealed
with "Repeal VT Supply."  10 VTs is way too much for winning.

I really am not in this for sordid pecuniary return, but for the Glory.

Therefore, should Proposal 3710 pass, I will divide my 10 VT Champion's
Reward amongst those (non-Scam) Players not voting AGAINST 3710, as equally
as possible, with any remainder going to the last such Player to vote (or
to declare presence or absence) on it.

I got a little excited before; I was misunderstanding (I think) the
intention behind the Instrument clause in the upcoming Scam.  I
apologize (once again) for getting so excited.

I transfer one Kudo from myself, for missing my medication,
		    to elJefe, for insinuating he was "slimy".

For what it's worth, I still think we should Impeach these people.
