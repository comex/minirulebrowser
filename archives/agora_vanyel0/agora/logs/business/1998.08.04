I hereby submit the following CFJ;
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Statement:
It is not possible to cast a Vote on a Proposal, Election or Referendum by
sending a message to the Public Forum.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Barred: Steve
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Arguments:

>From Rule 1859:
      Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
      any votes, or the declaration of Presence, by Voting Entities
      on Proposals, Elections or Referenda, may only be achieved by
      sending a message to the Vote Collector of the Proposal,
      Election, or Referendum only. (Players are, however, permitted
      to send or copy such messages to themselves.)

This clearly prevents a message to the Public Forum from effecting a Vote.
