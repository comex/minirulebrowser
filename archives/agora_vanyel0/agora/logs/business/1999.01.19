H. CotC,

I hereby call for judgement on the following statement, barring Scott
and Morendil:

>>
Morendil has not submitted the proposal titled "Ruleset Lite, II".
<<

R&A:

The first submission of the proposal failed because the email withthe
proposal did not reach the public forum, it seems.

Now Morendil and Scott argue that Morendil effectively submitted the
proposal when e later sent a mail to the PF (successfully) that quoted
the full text of the original mail in which Morendil had tried to (but
failed) to submit the proposal. This second mail, quoting the first,
is seen as a valid submission.

I disagree, and don't think that Morendil's (re-)post of the proposal
was a submission. The repost contained the text of the proposal marked
clearly as a quotation of an earlier email document, and the intent of
the repost containing the proposal text was to provide evidence that
the proposal had already been properly submitted earlier. So I do not
think the text reposted by Morendil was delivered "with the clear
indication that that text is intended to become a Proposal", and
therefore it was not a proposal as defined in R1483.

Kolja A.

Sigh, I think it was a mistake.  Well, this means Lee is officially no longer The Miscreant.

Hmm.  Interesting.  As Registrar, Andre is not empowered to transfer VTs from the Bank
to anyone.  According to the Rules, Registrar Andre should have issued a PO for 1 VT
from the Bank to Steve for this salary (see definition of "pay out" in the Rules).  However,
because Andre is also Chancellor, the Executor of the Bank, this particular TO is
effective and the transfer has been made.  I wonder if Steve's Distributor Salary has
actually been paid?  I think I have to assume that the number on the left is meaningless,
since there are no outstanding VT POs anymore, and the message does not really identify
that as a PO number (otherwise this TO purports to satisfy a non-existing PO).
