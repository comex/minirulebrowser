This message contains exactly one Proposal.  The Proposal begins
immediately after the line marked "**START PROPOSAL" and ends at the
end of the message.
  
The following Proposal is to be titled "Cooperation is a Good Thing"
and is to have Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it resolved, that Rule 1771 be amended, by replacing the paragraph
reading

      The Priority of the Proposal is increased or decreased, as
      specified by the Player making the payment, by an amount equal
      to the number of P-Notes transferred to the Bank, provided that
      this transfer is not executed for any other purpose.

with one reading

      The Priority of the Proposal is increased or decreased, as
      specified by the Player making the payment, by:
      (a) an amount equal to one-half the number of P-Notes
          transferred to the Bank, if the transferor was the Proposer
          of that Proposal, or
      (b) an amount equal to the number of P-Notes transferred to the
          Bank, otherwise;
      provided that this transfer is not executed for any other
      purpose.

[ This gives Players an incentive to get other people to pay to
  advance their Proposals in the Proposal Queue. ]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1701 be amended, by replacing "The
MUQ of P-Notes is 0.1." with "The MUQ of P-Notes is 0.01."

I hereby announce my intent to cause the following Proposals to be
Adopted Without Objection:

**********************************************************************

90. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Zero Payment Orders

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1599 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever a Rule requires a Player to execute a Payment
          Order, e shall do so within seven days of when the
          requirement arises.

      (b) The foregoing does not apply to any requirement to execute a
          Payment Order for zero units of any Currency.  Such Payment
          Orders need not be executed, any Rule to the contrary
          notwithstanding.

**********************************************************************

130. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Simplify Probate

Be it resolved, that Rules 1637, 1738, 1739 and 1757 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1601 be amended to read:

      (a) An entity is disempowered if it does not have an Executor.

      (b) The Notary is permitted and authorized to perform any of the
          following with respect to a disempowered entity:
        (1) transfer Currencies owned by the disempowered entity for
            the purpose of satisfying a Payment Order naming the
            disempowered entity as payor;
        (2) Without Objection, vacate any Payment Order naming the
            disempowered entity as payor or payee; or
        (3) Without Objection, transfer Currencies owned by that
            entity to the Bank.

      (c) A disempowered entity is considered to continue to have
          legal existence as long as it continues to possess units of
          Currency or is named as the payor or payee of a Payment
          Order, even if it would otherwise be dissolved or destroyed,
          or otherwise cease to have legal existence, prior to that
          time.

      (d) This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would impair
          the Notary in the exercise of the powers granted in
          subdivision (b) of this Rule.

**********************************************************************

I also hereby remove the Proposal 'Eliminate Transfer Orders' (#120)
from the Queue.
