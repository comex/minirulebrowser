Proto:  Declaration of Absence

Amend Rule 1715 to read:

      A Player may declare that e is PRESENT or ABSENT on a Proposal,
      Election or Referendum, by sending a message to that effect to
      the Vote Collector of this Proposal, Election or Referendum.

      Players who declare themselves PRESENT on a Proposal, Election
      or Referendum during the Voting Period of that Proposal,
      Election or Referendum are, solely for the purpose of
      determining Quorum, considered to have voted, but a Player who
      both declares emself PRESENT and also Votes on the Proposal,
      Election or Referendum is counted only once toward Quorum.

      Players who declare themselves ABSENT on a Proposal, Election
      or Referendum are not considered to have voted solely due to
      that declaration.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which determine
      Quorum or whether a Proposal, Election or Referendum has met
      Quorum.

Amend Rule 452 by replacing this text:

      This Rule shall in no way prohibit the Vote Collector from
      posting, at any time and to the Public Forum, a list of those
      Voting Entities which have already voted or declared that they
      are Present on a given Proposal, Election or Referendum, as
      long as e does not indicate specifically whether the Voting
      Entity has voted or declared Presence. Doing so is not a Crime,
      unless specified as such by another Rule.

PROTO: Stylish Rules
Let the following rule be created;
{Title: Stylishness of Rules}

     Every Rule has associated with it a value known as that Rule's 
     Stylishness.  A Rule's Stylishness shall be an integral value that 
     is positive, negative, or zero.  A Rule with a Stylishness that is 
     positive is a Stylish Rule, a Rule with a Stylishness that is 
     negative is a Dull Rule, a Rule with a Stylishness that is zero is 
     a Generic Rule. Upon the adoption of this Rule all Rules are 
     Generic.  The Rulekeepor shall include the Stylishness of each non-
     Generic Rule in the Full Logical Ruleset.


Let the following rule be created;
{Title: Changes to Rules' Stylishness}

     Whenever the Rules mandate a change in a Rule's Stylishness, the 
     Wizard shall inform the Rulekeepor of the change as soon as 
     possible after it is required.  The change in Stylishness does not 
     happen until the Rulekeepor is notified.

     Whenever a Proposal is adopted that changed the Proposer's Style, 
     every Rule that the Proposal created or amended shall have its 
     Stylishness change by the same amount.

     Every week, the Wizard shall randomly select one Generic Rule that 
     does not list the Player currently holding the Office of Wizard in 
     its Attribution.  When the Wizard selects this Rule e shall assign 
     it a new Stylishness based on the same criteria e uses for 
     proposals, this new Stylishness shall be an integral value between 
     -3 and 3, not including zero.


Let the following rule be created;
{Title: The Style Machine}

     This Rule is known as the Style Machine and may be referred to 
     unambiguously in that manner.  The Executor of the Style Machine is 
     the Wizard.  The Style Machine is a Voting Entity.  Every time the 
     Wizard produces a report, e shall also pay out a number of VTs to 
     the Style Machine equal to the number of Proposals in that Report 
     that changed their Proposer's Style. The Wizard is only permitted 
     to act on behalf of the Style Machine as explicitly directed in 
     this Rule.

     If the Style Machine possesses VTs, it shall act as follows;
     
       i) If a Proposal amends or repeals more Stylish Rules than Dull 
          Rules the Style Machine shall vote Against that Proposal.
      ii) If a Proposal amends or repeals more Dull Rules than Stylish 
          Rules the Style Machine shall vote For that Proposal.
     iii) If the above two conditions do not hold the Style Machine 
          shall Abstain on that Proposal.

     If the Style Machine does not possess VTs, it shall act as follows;

      iv) If a Proposal amends or repeals more Stylish Rules than Dull 
          Rules the Stle Machine shall not declare its Presence for that 
          Proposal.
       v) If the above condition does not hold, the Style Machine shall 
          declare its Presence on the Proposal.

     The Style Machine's votes shall count toward Quorum.  The Style 
     Machine's Votes cannot be changed once made.  This Rule takes
     precedence over the Rules covering Voting Entities and Votes in 
     general.

This now makes it a moot question, as far as the Herald's duties are concerned,
whether Morendil was registered as a Player when e became speaker.  If e was
not, e is registered now.  If e was, then the following Payment Order is

Therefore, in accordance with Rule 1437, I hereby command Morendil to pay 34
