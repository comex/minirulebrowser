In the matter of CFJ 1060, it is the opinion of the Judge that this
CFJ's Statement is FALSE.

My log of Public Forum messages includes a message from Ross
Morgan-Linial, also known as Antimatter, clearly requesting the
transfer of one Kudo from Harlequin to Blob (Exh. 1).  As far as I can
tell, Antimatter was a registered Player at the moment of this action
and had not previously transferred more than one Kudo during that
Nomic Week, and that Harlequin possessed at least one Kudo at that
time.  Therefore, the only question is whether Antimatter is empowered
to transfer Kudos at that time, in light of the fact that he was not
his own Executor.

I find that Antimatter's status as in Probate does not impair his
ability to execute Kudo transfers.  Rule 1378 states that a Kudo is
transferred when a Player sends a message to the Herald meeting
certain criteria.  Antimatter was, at the time in question, a Player,
and the message he sent satisfied the criteria of Rule 1378.
Therefore, the sending of that message is sufficient to effectuate a
Kudo Transfer, even though it was not sent by his Executor.

It has been argued that Antimatter is deprived of the power to make
Kudo Transfers because e is not eir own Executor.  I find this
argument lacking.  The Rules do not vest the power to make Kudo
Transfers in an Executor, as they do certain other powers, such as
Voting.  I do not see anything in Rule 1478 that prohibits a Player
who is not eir own Executor from exercising any power which the Rules
vest in Players directly, as long as that Player is actually capable
of acting on his own behalf (i.e. is not dead, unconscious, etc.).
Antimatter's status as an entity in Probate therefore does not deprive
him of his Rule 1378 power to effectuate Kudo transfers.

Judgement of FALSE is entered.

It is so ordered.

I transfer one Kudo FROM Harlequin, for being annoying in changing my
address, TO Blob, for being Zombified.

I transfer all of my assets to the Order of the Evil Eye, for safekeeping
until my return.

I deregister (again).

"Safekeeping". Right.
