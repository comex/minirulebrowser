Antimatter is correct.  H. Assessor take note, the second order above is
amended to deny voting privileges to Murphy for a period of two weeks,
beginning on June 22, 1998.

This Week with R-O-M

I find 352 Rules in the current Rule set.  Here are the five random selections
this week:

224 = Rule 1576 Names of Currencies
173 = Rule 1829 Refusal of Duty by the Speaker
 44 = Rule 1431 Claims of Error
267 = Rule 1845 Structures
162 = Rule 1575 Standards of Proof

I don't like any of the selections this week, but I have to pick something so
I'll pick Rule 1829.

Acting as Executor and on behalf of the Repeal-O-Matic, I hereby submit the
following proposal.

PROPOSAL: Repeal Rule 1829 (Refusal of Duty by the Speaker)
This Proposal shall have an AI = 1

Rule 1829 is hereby Repealed.

Here's a response to the good General's suggestion that we get rid of
Transfer Orders altogether -- that having them be a type of Order was not
constructive and didn't make as much sense as it should. This is also to
help with the Plots reform, by making the issues with Plot transfers easier
to deal with. This is a pre-PROTO; it's just the basic framework rules.
There are probably a hundred other amendments that it would need to make...
I'd like comments on this before I go any further.

Pre-PROTO-Proposal: Transfer Notices


Rename Rule 1598/7 (Power=1) ("Transfer Orders") "Transfer Notices" and
amend it to read:

      A Transfer Notice (TN) is a body of text which documents the
      transfer of ownership of one or more Nomic Entities from
      one entity (the "source") to another (the "recipient"). It 
      consists of text that unambiguously indicates that a transfer 
      is to take place and specifies any information required of a 
      Transfer Notice.

      When a valid TN is executed (sent to the Public Forum, or to 
      a Player charged by the Rules to track ownership of the Nomic 
      Entities in question), the transfer noted by the TN takes 
      place, as long as the source of the transfer possesses
      a sufficient quantity of the Nomic Entity in question. 
      Otherwise, the transfer fails.

      A valid Transfer Notice specifies exactly one source 
      entity and exactly one recipient entity, in addition to 
      any other specifications required by other Rules. 

      Each valid Transfer Notice must belong to exactly one class
      of Transfer Notices, as defined in other Rules.

Create a Rule entitled "Currency Transfer Notices" with the text:

      There exists a class of TN called "Currency Transfer Notices,"
      or CTNs. A CTN must specify a Currency of which units will be
      transferred, and a number of units of that Currency to be
      transferred, which must be a positive multiple of that
      Currency's MUQ. In addition, a CTN may only specify as its
      source the Player who executed the CTN, or an Entity whose
      Executor is the Player who executed the CTN.

      If a Currency Transfer Notice purports to satisfy a particular 
      Payment Order and either that Payment Order does not exist or 
      cannot be satisfied by the CTN, then the CTN is invalid.

Create a Rule entitled "Plot Transfer Notices" with the text:

      There exists a class of TN called "Plot Transfer Notices,"
      or PTNs. A Plot Transfer Notice must specify an individual
      Plot by name which is to be transferred. In addition, a
      PTN may only specify as its source the Player who executed
      the PTN, or an Entity whose Executor is the Player who
      executed the PTN. 

Rename Rule 1378 ("Kudo Transfers") "Kudo Transfer Notices" and amend it to
read:

      There exists a class of TN called "Kudo Transfer Notices,"
      or KTNs. A Kudo Transfer Notice must specify a justification
      for the transfer being made. In addition, the source and
      recipient of a KTN may not be the same.

      A player cannot execute a KTN if any of the following 
      conditions are true:

        a) The Player has executed two KTNs during the current
           Nomic Week.
        b) The source or recipient entity is not a Player.
        c) The recipient is the Player executing the KTN.
        d) The source is the same as the source of a KTN
           previously executed by the same Player during the
           current Nomic Week.
        e) The recipient is the same as the recipient of a KTN
           previously executed by the same Player during the
           current Nomic Week.
