I herby submit the following Proposal, paying the petition fee to do so.

NOTE: Point Tokens aren't included in this submission because they aren't
essential to this implementation.  They will be proposed later, if this
is adopted.

PROPOSAL: The Return of Points.

Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: Points and Scoring)

     Every Player has associated with em specific numerical value known 
     as their Score.  A Player's Score shall always be an integer.  If 
     the rules specify a non-integral change in a Player's Score, that 
     change shall be rounded to the nearest integer before being 
     applied.

     Only a Player can have a Score.

     Changes in a Player's Score can be referred to as a gain or loss of 
     Points.  A gain of some number of Points means that number is to be
     added to a Player's Score, a loss of some number of Points means 
     that number is to be subtracted from a Player's Score.

     This rule takes precedence over all other Rules dealing with Points 
     and Scoring.

{Comment: This is an attempt to initiate a Scoring system that does not 
          imply the treatment of Points as entities.  There's no talk of 
          transfers, creations or destructions.  "Points" as a term is 
          relegated to being a synonym for a Score change.
          v2: Added the requirement that only Players have Scores.
          v3: Removed a sentance that Steve "pointed" out as redundant.}


Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: the Scorekeepor)

     There is an Office of Scorekeepor whose salary is twice the Basic 
     Officer Salary.  The Scorekeepor shall keep and maintain a record 
     of the current Scores of each Player.  The Scorekeepor's Official 
     Report shall include the Scores of every player, the changes in 
     those Scores since the last report, and the reasons for those 
     changes.  E shall publish this report in the Public Forum at least 
     once a week.

{Comment: Fairly straightforward.}


Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: Winning Scores)

     If any Player reaches a Score of 100 or more, then the Player who 
     has the highest Score and no win-preventing conditions is Eligible 
     to Win the game.  In the case of a tie for the highest such Score, 
     all such Players are Eligible to Win.

     Whenever a Player becomes Eligible to Win the Scorekeepor must
     announce this event in the Public Forum as soon as possible. 

     If no Endgame Procedure is underway at the time of this
     announcement, this announcement initiates an Endgame Procedure.

     If an Endgame Procedure is underway, and a Player becomes Eligible 
     to Win (because of a loss of a win-preventing condition) this does 
     not imply that any other Player loses an Eligibility to Win already
     granted by the Scorekeepor.

{Comment: When someone reaches 100 points, someone wins (not necessarily 
          the same someone)  there is probably some explanation needed 
          for the Endgame Procedure--  there should be a chance a) for 
          Players to challenge the announcement with a COE, and b) for 
          those with high scores to try and buy off win-preventing 
          conditions (i.e. Blots)
          v2: Split this and the next rule into a number of smaller,
          more unified rules about the Endgame, clarifying a few points
          and dealing with a few things (deregistering winners, and 
          appeals to challenged Endgames) better.}


Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Initiating an Endgame Procedure}

     When the Scorekeepor announces that there is a Player Eligible to 
     win, and there is no Endgame Procedure underway, then that
     announcement shall initiate an Endgame Procedure.

     During an Endgame Procedure no Score changes shall be applied to 
     any Player.  All orders to change a Player's Score shall be 
     deferred until the termination of the Endgame Procedure.  This rule 
     takes precedence over Rules that would allow these changes to be 
     applied during the Endgame Procedure.

     An Endgame Procedure shall persist until it is terminated by the 
     Scorekeepor.

     An unchallenged Endgame Procedure shall be terminated one week from 
     the date of its initiation, unless the Rules require an earlier 
     termination.

{Comment: First of three rules dealing with events during the Endgame.}


Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: Challenging an Endgame Procedure)

     When the Scorekeepor initiates an Endgame Procedure it is initially 
     unchallenged.

     An Endgame Procedure is challenged if any of the following occurs 
     while it persists;

       i) A COE alleges an error in the Scorekeepor's announcement that 
          affects a Player's Eligibility to Win.

      ii) A CFJ is being decided which alleges an error in the 
          Scorekeepor's announcement that affects a Player's Eligibility 
          to Win.

     iii) An Appeal of a CFJ is being decided where the matter at 
          issue is an allegation of an error in the Scorekeepor's 
          announcement that affects a Player's Eligibility to Win.

     If a challenge is resolved finding that no error existed, the 
     Scorekeepor shall make an announcement stating that the Endgame 
     Procedure is now unchallenged, the Endgame Procedure shall be 
     terminated four days from this announcement, unless it is
     challenged again.

     If a challenge is resolved finding an error did exist, then all
     Players Eligible to Win cease to be Eligible to Win and the 
     Endgame Procedure shall be immediately terminated without a winner.

{Comment: Twiddled with this a little so it is a little clearer how 
          challenges to a win are handled.}


Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Losing Eligibility to Win}

     During an Endgame Procedure, if Player who is Eligible to Win 
     acquires a win-preventing condition, or ceases to be a Player, e 
     ceases to be Eligible to Win.

     If at any time during an Endgame Procedure there is no Player 
     Eligible to Win, the Procedure shall immediately terminate without 
     a winner.

{Comment: This was implied but not explicitly stated in the prior
          Proto.}


Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Termination of the Endgame Procedure.}

     Whenever the Rules call for the termination of an Endgame 
     Procedure, the Scorekeepor shall announce this fact in the Public 
     Forum as soon as possible after it occurs.  Upon the Scorekeepor's 
     announcement, the Endgame Procedure shall conclude with the 
     following effects, in order;

       i) If there was no successful challenge to the Endgame Procedure, 
          and there are still Players Eligible to Win, then all Players'
          Scores shall be set to zero.  The Scorekeepor must order this
          change.

      ii) If there was no successful challenge to the Endgame Procedure, 
          and there are still Players Eligible to Win, then those 
          Players Win.  All such Players then cease to be Eligible to
          Win.

     iii) All score changes that were suspended during the Endgame 
          Procedure shall be applied.

{Comment: Clarified some points about the suspended scoring, and made
          the actions of a terminating endgame more explicit.  The 
          ordering is to prevent an infinite loop for infinitesimal 
          fans.}


Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: Changing a Player's Score)

     A Player's Score is the Score reported by the Scorekeepor.  A 
     Player's Score changes only when the Scorekeepor records the 
     change.

     The Scorekeepor shall only record changes when a Player empowered 
     by the Rules to order such a change so orders eim. When the
     Scorekeepor is so ordered to make a change e must do so as soon as 
     possible.

     A Player's score is correct when it reflects all changes mandated 
     by the Rules and ordered by the appropriate Players.  A Player's 
     score is incorrect when it is in error, reflects changes that were 
     not ordered as mandated by the Rules, or fails to reflect a change 
     that was ordered as mandated by the Rules.

     A COE or CFJ can be issued alleging that a Player's score is 
     incorrect.  If such a CFJ or COE finds that the Score was 
     incorrect, then the Scorekeepor must order that Score to be changed 
     to the correct Score. (If an erroneous order resulted in the 
     incorrect score, this order counts as its reversal.  If an 
     unapplied order resulted in the incorrect Score, this order counts 
     as its application.  Such corrections shall not be applied twice.)

     If the Rules mandate a change in a Player's score, and do not 
     both require and empower a Player to order that change, that change
     shall not be included in any determination of a correct Score.

     The effect of ratifying the Scorekeepor's report is to render all 
     Scores listed in it as correct.

     This Rule takes precedence over any Rule that attempts to specify a 
     Player's Score.

{Comment: This is an attempt to have a completely pragmatic Officer's
          Report.  The Scores are what the Scorekeepor says they are.  
          (Another reason for the Endgame Procedure, the Scorekeepor can 
          illegally give someone a Score of 100, but then the Players 
          have a week to get a CFJ together, nullifying such a win.)
          v3: Added language so that there isn't confusion about the
          Scorekeepor ordering changes due to a CFJ.}


Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: Ordering Changes in a Player's Score)

     When a Rule states that a Player's Score must change, and specifies
     a Player who is required to order this change, that Player then
     must order the Scorekeepor to make this change as soon as possible 
     after the Rules mandate the change. This order shall be a message 
     to the Scorekeepor naming the Player subject to the Score change, 
     the reason for the change, and specifying the magnitude of that
     change.

     If a Player is required to order a change to the Score, then
     e is empowered to order it, but not necessarily vice versa.

{Comment: This is partially lifted from the Currency Rules, but it's in
          a simpler form since there's no conceit about virtual tokens 
          running around being created and destroyed, going from Player 
          to Player or to the Bank and back.
          v2: Added language to have the order include the reason for
          the score change.
          v3: Followed Steve's suggestion about require/empower.}


Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: The Omnibus Scoring Rule)

     In any week that at least one Rule Change Proposed by a Player is 
     adopted, that Player shall gain three Points.  The Rulekeepor must 
     order this Score change.

     In any week where a Player Voted on more than three Proposals, e 
     gains three Points. The Assessor must order this Score change.

     Whenever a Player wins an Election, e shall gain five Points.  The 
     Vote Collector for the Election must order this Score change.

     Whenever a Player becomes Speaker, e shall gain three Points.  The 
     Registrar must order this Score change.

     Whenever a Player gains three style points for a Proposal, e shall 
     gain two Points.  The Wizard must order this Score change.

     Whenever a Player Judges a CFJ, e gains three Points.  The Clerk of 
     the Courts must order this Score change.

     Whenever a Player gains a Blot, e shall lose two Points.  The 
     Herald must order this Score change.

{Comment: I think it's easier on everyone to have a single Rule that
          lists what causes Score changes, rather than going around 
          amending half a dozen Rules. I also tried to keep it so there 
          was only one Score-Changing event per Officer.}

I hereby submit the following Silly Proposal

[Title: The Matador]

[Comment: Badly rhymed, with a terrible pun. ]


      Let there exist the Patent Title of "Matador".

      There can only be one Matador at a time, never more.
      The Wizard (the Player same who designates the Boor)
      shall award or remove this Title (or even restore
      it) by announcing so to the Public Forum (for us to deplore).

      The Wizard shall award this Title for
      em who, of all Players, throws around the "bull" more!

   Being the time in which I must appoint a Silly Person,
   and so that anxieties will neither pester nor fester,
   and in order that our Silly Proposals will not worsen,
   I designate our next Silly Person to be Jester!

 (Poetry was never my strong point. ;)
