H. Promotor Crito,

I hereby submit the following Proposal, Disinterestedly.

####
Proposal
Block successive Revolts

[Comment: at present, nothing prevents two Revolts happening one right
after the other. Given that only 1/3 of Players are needed for a Revolt,
I think that newly elected Officers should be given a secure period
of a few weeks in which they need not fear another Revolt. This is also
fairer on the Registrar, who has to conduct all those Elections.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 1664 (Rebellion) be amended by 
replacing the text in it which currently reads:

      If at any time at least 1/3 of all Players are Rebellious a
      Revolt occurs.

with text which reads:

      If at any time at least 1/3 of all Players are Rebellious, and
      at least one month has passed since the last Revolt, a Revolt
      occurs.

####

It just OCCURS to me that the Cartographor apparently never noticed my
Movement to the Mad Scientist's Lab of November 20.  This is a COE.

SOMEONE's still got to keep the PREMISES in ORDER,
Ørjan.

I Call for the Appeal of this Injunction, as I believe it is not entirely
legal and appropriate.

> Injunction:  I hereby retract Harlequin's win.  Harlequin's
>              Champion's Reward is hereby revoked, and any benefits

This part does not appear to be in the form of an order to perform or fail
to perform actions.

> The Registrar must vacate the 10 VT PO due to this false win.

This part does not confirm to Rule 1733, which clearly specifies that such
Injunctions shall specify the Clerk of the Courts to make such Vacations.

> Any other benefit or reward that is not specifically named herein that
> is a direct result of said false win must also be
> removed/deleted/returned. 

This part violates part (i) and (iv) of Rule 663.  Moreover, as Champion's
Reward is still Platonically defined there is no need nor possibility for
using an Injunction to reverse it, even if this had been within a Judge's
general powers.  No possibility because there are no actions defined that
would reverse it; no need because it is automatically reversed since its
preconditions did not occur.

As we are planning and will (no doubt) soon have reforms to change this,
it is understandable that a future Time Agent would be confused about
this;  but the powers to make corrective Injunctions are still rather
limited, and the game is still partially based on automatic events rather
than Player actions.

Greetings,
Ørjan.
