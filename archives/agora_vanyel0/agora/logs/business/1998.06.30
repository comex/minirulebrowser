I may be too late, but I'll try anyway: I hereby pass the parcel to
Harlequin. 

I would also agree to a change that prolongs the game. I guess  this
is the typical problem with world wide email games - time zones are so
different that it is hard to do things in real time, with deadlines
only hours apart.

Sherlock's Probate

There having been no objection, I will go ahead and implement my plan.

>Transfer any Irises to the Order of the Evil Eye.

Sherlock has no Irises, so there are none to transfer.

>Transfer all other currencies to the Bank.

I transfer .5 VTs from Sherlock to the Bank.
I transfer 1 P-Note from Sherlock to the Bank.

>Vacate all outstanding POs where Sherlock is the
>Payor or Payee.

I vacate the VT Payment Order VT2266.

Sherlock's Probate is now complete.
