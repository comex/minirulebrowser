The following people have voting privileges and have not been using them:

Antimatter
elJefe
G. Chaos
Macross
Morendil
Oerjan

With 3 others denied voting privileges, this leaves a voting populace
of six players, five of whom have to vote to get a proposal to 
achieve Quorum. This is ridiculous. Therefore, I declare that all the
above Players are Quiet. And I ask that if they do make themselves 
Noisy again, that they also make themselves Inactive, so as to reduce
Quorum to a reasonable level.

Proto: Ease the Quorum Burden slightly.

Amend Rule 879/6 (Power=1)
Quorum

      Quorum for a Proposal is achieved if a vote is cast on that
      Proposal by one-third of Active Players with voting privileges,
      or one-fifth of all Players, whichever is greater.

      Quorum for a Proposal is calculated using the number of
      Registered Players, and their Hold statuses (On or Off), at the
      beginning of the prescribed Voting Period for that Proposal.

BZZZT, WRONG ! I'M NOISY, VERY NOISY.

There. ;)

Sorry, as an Officer I don't want do that. I'm just not much
interested in voting at the moment; it's becoming too much of a
hassle, and we're only seeing boring Proposals. I suspect some of
the other non-currently-voting Players share that opinion to some
extent.

I am not Quiet.  Nor do I believe it is reasonable to expect me to go
Inactive merely because there hasn't been a Proposal which I have
deemed sufficiently interesting to expend my very limited supply of
VTs on.

I said it before, and I'll say it again: you want me to vote, give me
a reason.  Harassing me by making me Inactive for not Voting is not a
reason.
