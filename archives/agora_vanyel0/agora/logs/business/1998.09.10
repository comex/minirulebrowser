[Distributor's note: The following message was not trapped by the

Nevertheless it has ended up in my administrator's mailbox at gecko
rather than going to the lists. I'm not entirely sure why. At any rate,
here's Proglet's Judgement on CFJ 1104. For the benefit of CotC Michael,
the original timestamp on the message was 9 Sep 98 00:50:45 EDT.]

Note: the assignment of this judge is still under dispute.
I currently believe that i am eligible to be a judge but not 
a justice for this CFJ

    Judge: Proglet
    Judgement: True

Judge's Arguments:
In the absence of any other ruling discovered by this judge, either 
in the ruleset or in the history of past judgements, the decision
comes down to one of common sense and definition.

The wwwebsters states (for defer) in part:
intransitive senses : to submit to another's wishes, opinion, or governance
usually through deference or respect <deferred to her father's wishes>
(also see yield)

This judge finds that the process of a "defer" gives away the power that the
rule has to make an effect. No part of the process of defering prevents the
preconditions of the rule from being true unless specifically stated.


This judge finds the caller's arguments reasonable, as with the suggested
motion.

Dear lee,

thanks a lot for the latest report. It is much clearer.

Secondly, I claim that this PO, as listed, is in error, too. Why in
the world should I have issued a PO to the bank naming myself as
payor?

Maybe I've forgotten the reason, but maybe you've also got payor and
payee mixed up for this VT. Could you please check this?

Thanks, 

Kolja A.

Since I can find absolutely no sign or shred of evidence of where I
came up with this, I admit your claim.  Sorry.  I will put it into
tonite's revised report.

H. Promotor Blob,

I hereby submit the following Proposal.

####
Proposal
A Duty to Vote

[Comment: a second try at this. Crito said he would have voted for it
if it hadn't been for the Blot penalty, so I've taken the Blot penalty
out. I've also added some other extraneous stuff at the end, including
the repeal of R1625 that 'Permanent Electioneering' was supposed to have
accompished.]

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "A Duty to Vote", be enacted
with the following text:

      An Active Player with effective control of more than three Voting
      Tokens at the time a batch of Proposals is distributed, who is not
      denied Voting Privileges at that time, who is Active at the end of
      the Voting Period of the Proposal in the batch whose Voting Period
      finishes latest, and who fails to cast a vote on any Proposal in
      the batch, commits the Infraction of Failing to Vote, to be
      detected and reported by the Assessor. The penalty for commission
      of this Infraction is 1 VT.

      Effective control of an asset (eg. a unit of Currency) is the
      ability to dispose of that asset as one wishes. The Assessor is
      empowered to make determinations as to whether a Player has
      effective control over a particular asset at a particular time.
      Such determinations are defeasible and may be overturned by the
      Courts.

      Three months after this Rule is created, this Rule shall repeal
      itself.

Be it further resolved that Rule 1016 (Putting Oneself on Hold) be
amended by replacing in it the text which currently reads:

      E may not do so until at least 96 hours after e last went On Hold.

with text which reads:

      E may not do so until at least a week after e last went On Hold.

Be it further resolved that R1838 (Tabula Rasa) be repealed.

Be it further resolved that R1744 (Danger! Danger Will Robinson!) be
repealed.

Be it further resolved that R1625 (Secrecy of Votes) be repealed.
