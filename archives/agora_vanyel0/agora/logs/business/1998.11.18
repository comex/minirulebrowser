I will be going on a long holiday to Australia (WA only I'm afraid,
otherwise I'd be looking up Steve and Blob) and New Zealand in
December and January.  I will be going on Hold before I leave (I'd
avoid it if I could because I take a perverse pride in the fact that
my last activity status change was in 1994 :-), and the Offices of
Registrar and Chancellor will be vacant.

I may be able to surface occasionally, and I have an e-mail address at
michael_norrish@yahoo.com, which will probably be easier to access
than my Lab account.

In any case, I don't leave Britain until 3 December.

Michael.

This message contains one or more Proposals.  Each Proposal begins
immediately after a line marked "**START PROPOSAL" and ends
immediately before the first following line marked "**END PROPOSAL".

The following Proposal is to be titled "Eliminate ASAP I" and is to
have Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it therefore resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Whenever the Rules require a Player to perform some duty
          after the occurence of an event, and specifies a time limit
          for doing so, the failure of that Player to perform the duty
          within that time limit in no way abates that Player's
          obligation to perform that duty, unless the Rule which
          imposes that obligation specifies otherwise.

      (b) Whenever the Rules require a Player to perform some duty at
          least once within any given time interval (such as once each
          week, or each month), and that Player fails to do so, e is
          not obligated to do so twice during the next such time
          period, unless the Rule which imposes that obligation
          specifies otherwise.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 208 be amended to read:

      (a) The Assessor shall publish all the Votes cast upon a
          Proposal within seven days of the end of that Proposal's
          Voting Period.

      (b) The Assessor shall not publish the Votes cast on a Proposal
          prior to the time e publishes the Votes cast on:
        (1) all Proposals whose Voting Periods ended before that of
            the Proposal in question, and
        (2) all Proposals whose Voting Periods ended at the same time
            as the Proposal in question and which have a lower number.

**END PROPOSAL

If you don't want to know the answer, don't ask the question.

The purpose of this email is to announce a win, as I claim there 
is a winner(s).

Date  of win: 18 November 8pm (2 hours ago)
Cause of win: Win by Monopoly
The identity of the Player or Players who Won the Game: 
Blob                             
Chuck                      
Crito                         
elJefe                      
G.Chaos                  
Kolja A.         
macross              
Michael                    
Morendil                     
Oerjan              
Proglet              
Steve               





Reasoning:
Within 36 hours of the time mentioned above, the players listed satisfy 
the condition of Winning by Ownership.
    (The rule claiming the existence of the entity "plots" is revoked 
     and hence do not exist tomorrow. Hence at that time, at least 1/3 
     (of all 0 plots) are not owned by the bank (Common mathematics). 
     All of the plots not owned by the bank are owned by X 
     (where X is any player) (common mathematics). Hence 
     at this time such each X satisfies a winning condition (Monopoly). 
     

The main part of this claim that may be considered dubious is that 
of the ability to use rule 1844. As I am making this claim of victory 
before 1844 is repealled, I believe that I may be able to use it. 
Perhaps a cfj(etc) is needed here?

There are other slightly dubious parts of this claim, I'll agree.
(eg I have kindof claimed a victory that will occur in the future).

Hopefully any cfj(etc) will be judged by one of those listed above :)

What do people think of this validity of this claim?
I have my doubts that it will succeed.
