A change of circumstances requires that I reformulate Vlad's Probate
Plan.  I therefore object to my previous plan on the grounds that it
will not fully dispose of Vlad's estate, and submit the following in
its place:

Vlad's estate is terminal; there is no Will.

The estate's assets are insufficient to meet all of its debts: there
are insufficient P-Notes, but an excess of VTs.  Since the only
creditor of the estate is the Bank, however, no purpose is served by
attempting to allocate VTs in lieu of P-Notes in this case.

Indulgences: Debits are POI274 and POI582, totaling 4 Indulgences.
All will be vacated, and 4 Indulgences will be transferred to the
Bank.

P-Notes: Debits are POP056, POP057, POP058, totaling 3 P-Notes.  All
will be vacated, and 2 P-Notes will be transferred to the Bank.

VTs: Sole debit is VT1480, totaling 0.5 VT.  It will be vacated.
There are no credits.  9 VTs will be transferred to the Bank.

Other Currencies: No debits, credits, or holdings.
