Morendil's Probate

Morendil, apparently legally, vacated the following satisfied POs:

POI305  12/02/97  01/06/98   TOI357      1     Morendil     Bank       Promotor
POI312  12/03/97  01/06/98   TOI358      2     Morendil     Bank      Registrar
POI316  12/09/97  01/06/98   TOI359      1     Morendil     Bank       Herald
POI318  12/09/97  01/06/98   TOI360      1     Morendil     Bank       Promotor
POI591  12/14/97  01/06/98   TOI361      1     Morendil     Bank       Herald
POI608  12/16/97  01/06/98   TOI362      1     Morendil     Bank       Herald
POI614  12/16/97  01/06/98   TOI363      1     Morendil     Bank       Herald
POI628  12/22/97  01/06/98   TOI364      1     Morendil     Bank       Herald

Therefore I must issue the following reversals:

The Bank is ordered to pay 1 Indulgence to Morendil.
The Bank is ordered to pay 2 Indulgence to Morendil.
The Bank is ordered to pay 1 Indulgence to Morendil.
The Bank is ordered to pay 1 Indulgence to Morendil.
The Bank is ordered to pay 1 Indulgence to Morendil.
The Bank is ordered to pay 1 Indulgence to Morendil.
The Bank is ordered to pay 1 Indulgence to Morendil.
