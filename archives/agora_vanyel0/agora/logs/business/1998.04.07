Ah - wait a minute here, will you. For what that's worth, I hereby
contest this Report of Infraction on the grounds that I had reached a
determination on the matter being considered before the seven-day
period ran out, as evidenced in part by my posting, to the discussion
list, a message entitled 'Proto-decision in 1090' which outlined my
argument.

I note that Rule 1447 doesn't require that I submit an actual
document to the CotC within the specified deliberation period; it
merely requires me to have made up my mind on the matter within that
period.

I hereby affirm, under penalty of perjury, that following my
proto-decision posting and feedback from another Player on whether I
was justified in Sustaining the Judgement, I had reached a
determination on the matter before Sat., April 4th.

I submitted a decision to the CotC in a message with the following
headers, and thus I note that according to 1447/11 the CotC is 
required to accept and publish this decision.

Date sent:        Sat, 4 Apr 1998 18:15:35 +0100


Rule 1447/11 (Power=1)
Final Judgement upon Appeal

      Once a Board of Appeals has been selected to decide a particular
      appeal, the Justices shall, collectively, consider the question.

      Each Justice has seven days, from the point e becomes Justice on
      a particular Board, in which to reach a determination that
      either sustains or overturns the matter being considered by that
      Board and submit it to the CotC.

      Failure to do so is the Infraction of Failing to Judge an
      Appeal, detected and reported by the CotC, bearing a penalty of
      3 Blots, which results in that Justice's dismissal as a Justice
      from that Board. In this case the CotC must randomly select an
      eligible Player to replace em.

      After all three Justices have submitted their determinations to
      the CotC, the CotC shall post these determinations in the Public
      Forum along with any arguments, evidence, or other material
      included with those determinations.

      If a majority of the Justices agree to sustain the matter being
      considered, it is sustained; otherwise, it is overturned.  The
      specific results of overturning a matter upon appeal are
      determined by the Rules permitting such appeals.

      Each Justice who submits eir determination to the CotC before
      the end of the assigned deliberation period shall receive a
      Judicial Salary of 1 VT each upon the publication of their
      determinations.

H. Promotor Crito,

I hereby submit the following Proposal, paying 2 P-Notes to the Bank
to increase its Priority to 2.

####
Proposal
Variable Batch Sizes

[Comment: fixed the bug spotted by Murphy (I think?), and decided
after all to force the Promotor to give a bit of warning - 4 days,
in fact. Note that "midnight GMT Thursday" is assumed to mean
Wednesday night/Thursday morning, in line with the customary 
interpretation of R459.]

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule entitled "The Promotor can change
the Batch Size" be created with the following text:

      The Batch Size is an integer with a value between two and six
      inclusive, indicating the number of Proposals which will be
      distributed by the Promotor in the following Nomic Week,
      provided that there are that many Proposals in the Queue.
      Unless the Rules give it another value, the Batch Size is five.

      The Promotor may change the value of the Batch Size by
      announcing the new value in the Public Forum, provided that
      e announces a value between two and six inclusive, that e makes
      the announcement prior to midnight GMT Thursday, and that e has
      not already made such an announcement earlier in the Week. As
      indicated above, this change in the Batch Size has the effect
      of changing the number of Proposals which will be distributed
      by the Promotor in the Nomic Week *following* that in which the
      change is made; once the Week has begun, the Promotor cannot
      change the number of Proposals which will be distributed in
      that Week by changing the Batch Size.
      
Be it further resolved that R1770 (Distributing Proposals) be amended
by replacing the text in which currently reads:

      If there are five or fewer Proposals in the Proposal Queue
      having a Priority greater than zero, then the batch shall
      consist of all such Proposals.

      If there are more than five such proposals, then the batch
      shall consist of the first five such Proposals, in the order
      given by the Queue.

with text which reads:

      If the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue with a
      Priority greater than zero is less than or equal to the Batch
      Size, then the batch shall consist of all such Proposals.

      If the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue is greater
      than the Batch Size, then the batch shall consist of those
      Proposals in the Queue with the highest Priority such that the
      number of Proposals distributed is equal to the Batch Size.
