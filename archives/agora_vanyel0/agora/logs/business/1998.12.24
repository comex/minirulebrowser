I hereby nominate for Treasuror.

Here are the ideas for my budget: 

- I want a more or less even start for all players. 

- I don't want to try and catch up with the VT transactions of the
last few months.

- I don't want to bankrupt the groups that own VTs. Admittedly, I'm
involved with both organizations that own significant amounts of VTs,
and therefore have a personal interest. But I also think there's no
point in having such things in the rules and then punishing those
players who use them, e.g. by entrusting their money to them.

- There are only 50 VTs available to be distributed. That's much less
than the 120 VTs or so that were around when the last Accountor's
report was published. We have 15 players at the moment, so I'll start
with 1.5 VTs per player. Yes, that's not much - but 50 VTs overall
isn't much either. You have only yourselves to blame - you adopted the
proposal with this limit ;) I'll adjust up or down a little for those
whose VT holdings were way above or below average (around 5 VTs) in
the last known report, and add a little for officers who missed a lot
of salaries.

This leads to a budget something like this, shown as basic 1.5, plus
or minus something for the last known report, plus officers' rewards.

Andre       1.5              = 1.5
Blob        1.5       + 1    = 2.5
Chuck       1.5              = 1.5
Crito       1.5 + 0.5 + 1    = 3
elJefe      1.5              = 1.5
G. Chaos    1.5              = 1.5
Kolja A.    1.5              = 1.5
lee         1.5 + 0.5        = 2
Macross     1.5 + 1          = 2.5
Michael     1.5       + 1    = 2.5
Morendil    1.5       + 0.5  = 2
Murphy      1.5       + 0.5  = 2
Oerjan      1.5              = 1.5
Proglet     1.5 - 1          = 0.5
Steve       1.5 - 0.5 + 0.5  = 1.5
Order                         13
Threat                         0.5
X Group                        2
MBC                            5
----------------------------------
                              50

If you think you deserve a little more, let me know and I'll work it
in. I think that's easier than recalculating everything.

Kolja A. 

And a merry Christmas to you all!
