A good idea, but I will still need someone to take over my duties, as 
I will not be not be back until after the 8th. If nobody volunteers 
soon, I'll be forced to dump the job on the Speaker.

BTW: I am not planning to re-nominate for Promotor in the upcoming 
Elections. The job is lots of fun, but it is consuming far too much of
my time. I have a PhD to do, sadly.

H. Promotor,

I submit the following proposal, and pay one P-Note to raise its priority to one.

---------------------------
Proposal:  Honour without Dishonour

Let the following Rule be created with Power = 1;

Herald's Privilege

      No more than once a month, the Herald may increase the honour
      of a Player, other than emself, by announcing in the Public
      Forum the identity of that Player and the reason for the increase.
      At the same time as e makes this announcement, the Herald shall
      record an increase of one Kudo in the holdings of said Player.

[A nice perk for the Herald, and a way to recognize honorable acts
of Players without requiring a 'victim'.  I deliberately left the
allowable justifications to the discretion of the Herald.]

--Crito

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               !
