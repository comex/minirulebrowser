I hereby delegate the office of ambassador to Murphy from 29 Aug to 6
Sep 1998. 

Thanks very much for helping out, Murphy! I think you have to confirm
that you accept the delegation to make this work.

H. Promotor Blob,

I hereby submit the following Proposal:

####
Proposal
Lower the MUQ of VTs

[Comment: the new 5% commission which the Assessor takes out of votes
spent on Proposals means awkward rounding problems unless we lower the
MUQ of VTs. I could propose to lower it to 0.05, but we might as well go
the whole way and lower it to 0.01.]

Be it hereby resolved that R1696 (Voting Tokens) be amended by replacing
the text in it which currently reads:

      The MUQ of VTs is 0.1.

with text which reads:

      The MUQ of VTs is 0.01.
####
