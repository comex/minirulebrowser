Laurent's appeal was worded thusly:

>"I'm" and "tree!" are not single words. :-P

I am inclined to judge this Injunction legal and appropriate, as it appears
on its face to satisfy the requirements of Rule 908.

"I'm" is a contraction, which is a gray area for "words".  One common-sense
sufficiency test for being a word seems to be indivisibility, namely
whether the text could be divided into smaller parts that could stand on
their own.  "I'm" cannot be so divided, and I would say that it counts as a
word.

In passing, I note that though "tree!" may not be a word, "tree" is, and
the "!" could be taken as the terminator of the Judge's sentence rather
than part of a Prescribed Word.  An apology that included "tree" but not
the string "tree!" would probably satisfy the injunction.

I invite comment.

Regards,
-- elJefe

H. Assessor General Chaos:

I hereby cast my votes in Proposals 3664 - 3669 as follows:

>   3664 Steve          1 Repeal VT Supply

Present.


>   3665 G. Chaos       2 Synonymity

2 votes FOR


>D  3666 G. Chaos       1 Award Oerjan the Title of Exorcist

FOR


>D  3667 Repeal-O-Matic 3 Repeal Rule 116

AGAINST.


>D  3668 Kolja A.       1 ROM proposal readability

AGAINST.  This does nothing for the readability.  Having the Promotor
include the title of the Rule, instead of the full text, would work.


>D  3669 Kolja A.       1 Blot amnesty

2 votes AGAINST.  This only affects Morendil, who has already announced a
Probate plan to vacate all his Blots. Which means this Rule would leave him
with 34 Indulgences and 0 Blots.

This Claim is barred.  The report in question has been rescinded by
myself, in a message dated Tue, 30 Dec 1997 06:12:58 -0500.  Your COE
is therefore barred because another message has corrected the error.

The request to vacate POP111 is, however, granted.  POP111 is hereby
vacated.

Very good point. H. Assessor, I hereby cast a second vote AGAINST P3669.

I'm going away tomorrow for a few days, so I'm going to propose this now.

H. Promotor Crito,

I hereby submit the following Proposal, Disinterestedly.

####
Proposal
Real VT scarcity *now*

[Comment: as promised, a proto for real VT scarcity, now. I've opted
for direct VT destruction for getting VTs back, rather than the much
more complex issuing of POs by the Chancellor, which would require
each Executor to make a Transfer Order returning their VTs to the
Bank. The paying out of VTs can be done simply by issuing TOs from
the Bank by the Chancellor, though, so I've opted for that. I note
that PC appears to have negated that effects of reforming R594: we're
back to the situation where you need to propose self-repealing Rules
to make game state changes by Proposal.]

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule be created with the following text:

      Upon the creation of this Rule, all Voting Tokens are
      destroyed. Furthermore, as soon as possible after the creation
      of this Rule, the Chancellor shall, for each Player, execute a
      Transfer Order for five Voting Tokens, naming the Bank as
      payor, and that Player as the payee.

      This Rule shall repeal itself as soon as the Chancellor
      has executed the Transfer Orders required by it.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would
      prevent VTs from being destroyed.
####
