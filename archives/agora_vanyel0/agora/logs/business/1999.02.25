I hereby move to OVERTURN the judgement and replace it with one of
FALSE. 

Andre has pointed that regardless of whether or not Kolja granted
Power of Attorney to Steve, he still had the ability to at any time
retract this grant and then assume complete control of his assets.
The issue then becomes one of deciding whether or not this constitutes
"effective control".  As many have pointed out, Kolja certainly did
not have exclusive control of his assets as Steve could have also
spent his currencies while he had PoA for Kolja.  Nonetheless, the
rule in question only asks us to decide whether or not Kolja A.  had 
effective control of his assets.  

This Justice believes that he did. 

Michael.

I too appeal this Judgment.

When I voted, there were two Proposals which had been distributed
by the Promotor with the number 3830. The fact that one of these
numbers was not "official" notwithstanding, I think it it reasonable
to conclude that confusion might exist over which Proposal I was
referring to. Take an analogous case. There are two Proposals
up for vote:

4999: Proposer: Blob   Title: Morendil's Proposal

5000: Proposer: Morendil   Title: Invalid Judgements

If I post a message to the PF saying "I vote for Morendil's 
Proposal", which one gets my vote?

If you are willing to say that is ambiguous, what if Proposal
4999 was known as "Morendil's Proposal" colloquially, but had
some other title. Why wouldn't the same message be ambiguous?

Now imagine that we had a long voting period, say 1 month.
At the beginning I voted for "Morendil's Proposal", and only
later did 4999 get that as a colloquial title. Surely circumstances
occurring after the vote shouldn't affect the clarity: In this
case, I would agree that the message cast a vote on 5000.

In this case, it wasn't a colloquial reference I was using, but
an apparently official number given to the Proposal. The fact
that this number was assigned in error was only revealed after
my vote (At least, I received it later). The fact that an
omniscient person after the fact knew which was the "real"
3830 shouldn't void the ambiguity of the reference for us
mortals.

I offer 0.5 VT to the third Player joining this appeal as incentive.

Vlad

1774 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) A Proposal enters the Proposal Queue when it is received
          from a Proposing Entity by the Promotor.

      (b) A Proposal leaves the Proposal Queue when it is distributed,
          withdrawn, or discarded, or when the Rules otherwise require
          it.

      (c) The Promotor may, by Public Forum Announcement, discard any
          Proposal in the Proposal Queue which was Proposed over a
          month previously and which has zero or negative Priority.

      (d) The Proposer of a Proposal in the Queue may, by Public Forum
          Announcement, remove that Proposal from the Queue.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Each Proposal in the Proposal Queue has a priority.
        (1) When a Proposal enters the Proposal Queue, it has a
            priority of zero.
        (2) Any Player may, by Public Forum Announcement, increase or
            decrease the Priority of a Proposal in the Proposal Queue
            by any amount provided that e simultaneously transfers to
            the Bank a number of P-Notes equal to the magnitude of the
            change e wishes to make, and that transfer is not made for
            any other purpose.
        (3) At most once in each week, the Promotor may, by Public
            Forum Announcement, increase by one the Priority of any
            Proposal in the Proposal Queue, provided that the Proposal
            was not Proposed by emself.
        (4) At the beginning of each month, the priority of all
            Proposals in the Proposal Queue which were proposed over a
            month previously is decreased by one.  The Promotor shall
            report all such changes as soon as possible after the
            beginning of the month.

      (b) Proposals in the Proposal Queue are sorted in Queue Order by
          ordering them by descending Priority; Proposals with the
          same Priority are ordered by increasing time in the Proposal
          Queue.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Each week, the Promotor shall select from the Proposal Queue
          and distribute a number of Proposals equal to that week's
          Proposal Limit.
        (1) The Proposal Limit for a given week shall be the lesser
            of:
          (A) the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue with
              Priority greater than zero at the time of the first
              distribution of Proposals in that week; and
          (B) the Maximum Proposal Limit in effect at the start of
              that week.
        (2) Proposals shall be selected for distribution from the head
            of the Proposal Queue, in descending Queue Order.

      (b) The Maximum Proposal Limit is an integer between two and
          six, inclusive.  The Promotor may set the Maximum Proposal
          Limit to any value in this range at any time by announcing
          the change in the Public Forum; the change takes effect 72
          hours after it is announced.  Until the Promotor sets
          another value, the Maximum Proposal Limit is three.

      (c) At the time the Promotor distributes a Proposal, e shall
          give it a unique identifier for reference.  No Proposal may
          be given the same identifier which was previously assigned
          to any other Proposal

      (d) The Promotor shall endeavor to distribute all of the
          Proposals required to be distributed in a given week at one
          time; however, supplemental distributions are permitted only
          within the same week if, for some reason, the previous
          distribution(s) in that week do not exhaust that week's
          Proposal Limit.

      (e) A message is a Proposal Distribution only if it claims
          explicitly to be so.  The message distributing a Proposal
          must set forth its exact text, and should also set forth the
          unique identifier assigned it by the Promotor, the identity
          of its Proposing Entity, and its requested Adoption Index. 
          Any error in the text of a distribution Proposal renders its
          distribution void, as is a second or subsequent distribution
          of a Proposal previously distributed.  An error in any other
          part of a distribution has no effect on the validity of that
          distribution.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) The Promotor shall publish the Proposal Queue weekly. This
          publication shall set forth, for each Proposal then in the
          Proposal Queue, in Queue Order:
        (1) a unique identifier assigned to it by the Promotor;
        (2) its Title;
        (3) its current priority; and
        (4) the date and time when it was Proposed.

      (b) This publication shall also describe any changes to the
          Priorities of the Proposals in the Queue and the reasons
          therefore.  This publication need not contain the text of
          Proposals in the Queue.
