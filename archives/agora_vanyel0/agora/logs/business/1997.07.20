Changes from advisory version:
* A Payment Order is not issued for P3533, as Rule 947/10 was still
  in effect when it was adopted.  I merely report that General Chaos
  received 3 P-Notes upon the adoption of Proposal 3533.
* Amendment of R1543 by P3533 is a null amendment, and is thus
  cosmetic, rather than substantial as previously reported.  (Also
  note the amendment of R1672 by P3532 was also null, but this was
  already noted as cosmetic in the advisory version.
* Self-repeal of R1740 listed.  (Note this was not instantaneous
  upon taking effect, but occured at a later time.)

Proposals which do not enact any Rule Changes are not
listed here.

I have created a new Rule Category, "Probate", into which I have
placed Rules 1738 and 1739.

I intend to move Rule 1601 ("Probate") into the Rule Category "Probate"
from its current Category "Currencies" Without Objection.

I intend to move Rule 1637 ("Wills") into the Rule Category "Probate"
from its current Category "Subordinate Legal Codes" Without Objection.

I intend to change the Title of Rule 1470 ("The Mint and the Bank")
to "The Bank" Without Objection.

A review of the effects of Proposal 3533 leads me to believe that all
Votes cast on present Proposals under the authority of Rule 1442/10
will not be counted, but no VTs will be charged for them.  As a
result, all votes cast prior to 15 July 1997, 20:01:55 UTC will not be
counted.  This does not affect Declarations of Presence will be
counted regardless of when they were made.

I am not clear on whether Players whose Votes are discounted as a
result will count toward Quorum; I invite opinions on this matter.

Votes cast after 15 July 1997 20:01:55 UTC will be handled in
accordance with Rule 1442/11.

This only affects Proposals 3534 thru 3539, whose collective Voting
Period ends at 21 Jul 1997, 18:29:47 UTC (about 17 hours from now).
Recasting your votes before then will ensure that they are counted.

I am unable to publically reveal who this affects without violating
Rule 1625.  It may be legal for me to private inform the affected
parties; I invite opinions on this matter as well.

AGAINST - This is based on an old version of 1543. Since then the Wizard
has become an Officer, and I do not want to change it back.

Also, I am all for having Style Points no longer reset, but I'm not too
keen on the "High Style Mark" thing. Perhaps these could be made into 
separate proposals?
