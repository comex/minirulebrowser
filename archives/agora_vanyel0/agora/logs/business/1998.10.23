The voting period for October's MBC is over. Lee's subway system got
two and a half votes (from Macross and myself, and a hlaf vote from
Morendil - half because Morendil voted before Macross' Tavern in the
Clouds was published as an alternative). 

The price for Lee as winner of the Categors "Best Room" is herby
awarded: As Executor of the MBC I transfer 1.5 VTs from the MOO
Builders' contest to Lee.

Submissions for the November competition are cordially invited.
