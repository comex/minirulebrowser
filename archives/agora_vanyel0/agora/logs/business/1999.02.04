The following message contains exactly one Proposal.


The Grand Agoran Tournament
This Proposal consists of a number of Proposed Rule Changes, each
marked by *

* Create a Rule entitled "The Grand Agoran Tournament" with the
following text:

	The Grand Agoran Tournament consists of a series of Rounds.
These Rounds begin on the First of March, June, September, and October
of each year, and last for three months. The first Round begins March
1, 1999. At the beginning of each Round, the Scorekeepor will draw up
a list of all Active Players in descending order of their Scores from
the preceding Round. For the first Round, this will be done instead in
descending order of the Players' combined P-Note and VT holdings taken
from the most recent Official Reports. Ties will be broken by random
selection. 
	The Scorekeepor will then define a number of Circles among
which the Active Players will be partitioned. These must be as few as
possible, but there is a minimum of three Circles and an initial
maximum of six Players per Circle. They are designated the First
Circle, Second Circle, etc. ... Nth Circle. The First Circle is the
highest ranking Circle, and the Nth Circle is the lowest ranking
Circle.
	 The initial number of spots in each Circle will be the number
of Active Players divided by the number of Circles (FRD). If there are
more Active Players than spots the Scorekeepor will add one spot to
the Nth Circle, then one to the N-1th Circle, etc. until there are
exactly as many spots as Active Players. The First Circle spots are
filled with the highest ranked Players from the preceding Round
(skipping Inactive Players), and so on down the remainder of the
Circles in order. After the above procedure, if a Player is assigned a
Circle below that of another Player with whom e was tied at the end
the last Round, that Player shall be moved into the same Circle as the
Player with whom e was tied (this last procedure is ignored for the
first Round). The initial Score for each Player in each Round is zero.
	When a Player joins the game e is automatically assigned to
the same Circle e held when e deregistered (if applicable and
possible), or else the lowest Circle. A Player going On Hold is
automatically withdrawn from the current Round of competition. A
Player coming Off Hold is treated as a new Player for the purposes of
this Rule, with an initial Score of zero.

* Create a new Rule entitled "Competitions" with the following text:

The Individual Competition
	At the end of each Round each Player with the highest Score in
eir Circle wins that Round for that Circle and receives the
corresponding Scoring Patent Title. Any Player winning eir Circle has
the option of not participating in the Round immediately following. To
exercise this option, the Player must post eir wishes to the Public
Forum within two weeks after the beginning of the Round e is opting
out of. The Player then receives no Score, and is ineligible for SPTs.
The next Round the Scorekeepor shall seed the Player based on the
score that Player received two Rounds previously.

The Team Competition
	The Team Competition runs parallel to and concurrently with
the Individual Competition. A Team consists of a group of Players who
have signed an Application to Form a Team within two weeks of the
beginning of the Round in which they wish to compete. If fewer then
two Teams register for a round, there is no Team Competition that
Round. A Team's Score is the combined Scores of its members. A Team
wins the Team Competition if at the end of that Round its Score is
greater than that of the other registered Teams. If a Team is formed
and persists to the end of the Round without being dissolved, the
Scorekeepor shall instruct the Accountor to pay out 2 VTs to each
member of that Team. The Accountor shall then do so.

*	Create a Rule entitled "Applications to Form a Team" with the
following text:

There is a type of Application called an Application to Form a Team
(AFT). A valid AFT, in order to have effect upon Execution, must
contain the following:

i)	The name of the proposed Team.
ii)	The Players who will compose the Team, which must include the
Sponsor.
iii)	The Signatures of the Players who will compose the Team.

The Sponsor of an AFT will be known as the Team Captain for the
duration of the Round.

To be valid, an AFT must also fulfill the following conditions:
i)	The proposed Team must consist of at least three Players
ii)	No two proposed Team members may belong to the same Circle.
iii)	No proposed Team Member may belong to an already existing
Team.
If any of the above three conditions ceases to be true, a Team is
immediately dissolved and removed from the current Team Competition.

A valid AFT is Executed by sending it to the Scorekeepor or submitting
it to the Public Forum.

The effect of Execution of an AFT is the entrance of the proposed Team
into the current Team Competition. A Team is automatically dissolved
at the end of the current Round, but may register again in subsequent
Rounds.

An AFT shall only be valid if its contents are not in conflict with
this or other Rules.  An AFT that is not valid shall never be
Executed.

* Create a Rule entitled "The Scorekeepor" with the following text:

	There is an Office of Scorekeepor, whose Salary is 1.5 times
the Basic Officer Salary, and whose responsibility it is to keep
accurate track of the current Score of all Players. The Scorekeepor's
Report consists of the Circles of the current Round and the Players in
each Circle, the current Scores of each Player, the changes in Scores
since the last Report and the way those points were earned, the Teams
entered in the current Team Competition, and the current Team Scores
of each Team. The Scorekeepor is only obliged to keep track of scores
and post reports if a Round is currently underway.
	The Scorekeepor is also responsible for posting the final
Scores at the end of each Round, and announcing the SPTs awarded to
the Players that have fulfilled the conditions for receiving them.
	Once per Round, no more than two weeks and no less than one week
before the end of the Round, the Scorekeepor may act to change
the Scoring Rule Without 3 Objections. The Scorekeepor may only
propose changes to the basis of Scoring, otherwise the Action
automatically fails. If the action takes effect, the Scoring Rule
is changed appropriately at the beginning of the next Round.

* Create a Rule entitled "Scoring" with the following text:

 	Players receive Points when certain actions are performed by
them or when certain events occur. This is the only Rule which
may define the methods of Scoring. In general, a Player may receive
points only for actions which occur during the current Round, although
those actions may depend on others which occurred previously (thus,
for example, a Player could gain points for one of eir Proposals
passing, even if the Proposal was distributed before the beginning of
the current Round.). Points are non-transferable.
	In general, a Player may receive points for a certain type of
event any number of times, unless that event has a number (N) after
it, in which case a given Player may be awarded points for that type
of event only N times in a given Round.
	If not otherwise noted, Points awarded for events referring to
"a Player" or "any Player", go to that Player. Bonuses are in addition
to the basic award. Multipliers are in lieu of the basic award.
Bonuses can be multiplied.

Responsibility for detecting changes to a Player's Score from the
following events is the responsibility of the Scorekeepor:

If a Proposal proposed by a Player passes: 5 points for first passing
Proposal by that Player in that Round, 3 for second, 1 for third, 0.5
for fourth and subsequent Proposals, +0.5 if Proposal is a Repeal, +1
if the Proposer does not Vote on the Proposal. Double points if
Proposal passes unanimously. Triple Points if the Player making the
Proposal is the only Entity who votes AGAINST.

To any Player winning a contested Election: 8 points. Double points if
Elected unanimously.

To any Player holding the most of a given currency at the end of a
Round: 8 Points per currency. Tripled if at any point during the Round
a Player had no holdings in that Currency.

To any Player tied for the most of a given currency at the end of a
Round: 5 Points per currency. Tripled if at any point during the Round
a Player had no holdings in that Currency.

To any Player holding no Currency whatsoever at the end of a Round: 5
Points.

To any Player earning no Blots during a Round: 4 Points.

To any Player having no Blots at the end of a Round: 6 Points.

To any Player voting on a Proposal: If the Player casts at least
one vote which is the same as 80% or more of the Votes cast on a
Proposal (including eir own): 1 Point, scored when the Proposal
results are announced.

To any Player voting on a Proposal: If the final tally of Votes
shows the same number of FOR votes as AGAINST votes: 2 Points,
scored when the Proposal results are announced.

To the Player Voting or declaring Presence on all Proposals of a
single distribution: 0.5 Points.


Changes to a Player's score from the following events may be reported
by any Player by notifying the Scorekeepor or posting to the Public
Forum. No Player, however, not even the Scorekeepor, is legally
required to do so.

If a Rule is created containing a Player's name in the text: 15
Points.

If a Player gains a Patent Title (other than SPTs or Degrees): 4
Points (1).

To any Player receiving a Degree: 4 Points for am A.N., 6 points for a
B.N., 8 Points for a M.N., and 12 Points for a D.N.Phil or a D.N.Hist.

If a Proposal made by a Player successfully creates a Rule with a
number that is a multiple of 23: 4 Points.

If a Player submits a Proposal to the Queue that is subsequently
discarded: 5 Points (1).

To any Player Proposing an Insane Proposal for which no Entity votes
FOR: 30 Points.

To any Player who is chided for posting a single document that is not
an Official Report to a forum other than the Public Forum by more than
one Player (other than themselves): 2 Points (1).

To the third Player other than the Poster making substantive comments
to a protoproposal: 1 Point (3).

To the Player making a COE that is Responded to and admitted by the
relevant Officer (other than themselves): 1 Point (1).

To the Player Holding an Office for at least one month during the
Round, and issuing at least one Official Report: 2 Points (1)

To the Player making a Sane Proposal for which a Non-Player Voting
Entity successfully Votes: 15 points (1).

To the Player making a Senate Proposal for which a non-Senator
successfully Votes: 25 points (1).

To any Player submitting a Judgment for a CFJ which is not Appealed
before the end of the Round: 1 point.

To the Player making a CFJ which is not Judged for one month from its
original assignment: 8 Points (1 per Player per CFJ).

When an Appeal successfully overturns a Judgment, to the Players
calling for that Appeal: 2 Points

When an Appeal fails to overturn a Judgment, to the Judge who made the
original Judgment on that CFJ: 4 Points.

If three consecutive CFJs are Judged TRUE, FALSE and UNDECIDED (in any
order), to the Player making the third CFJ: 17 Points.

When a Player is Deregistered due to Silence, to the Player last
making em Silent: 5 Points.

To the Player successfully Calling for a Revolt: 15 Points.

* Create a Rule entitled "Scoring Patent Titles" with the
following Text:

	Scoring Patent Titles (SPTs) are a subclass of Patent Titles.
They are identical to Patent Titles except that they are automatically
revoked at the end of the Round subsequent to the one for which they
were awarded. The valid SPTs, and the circumstances for which they are
awarded, are as follows:

For winning an Individual Competition in the Nth Circle, a Player
receives the SPT of 'Victor of the Nth Circle' (where Nth is replaced
by the ordinal corresponding to eir Circle number). If a Player wins
the same Circle two Rounds in succession e receives instead the SPT of
'Double Victor of the Nth Circle', for three consecutive Rounds
'Triple Victor of the Nth Circle', etc.

If two or more Players within a Circle are tied for the highest score
in a Circle at the end of a Round, they receive the SPT of
'Pseudo-Victor of the Nth Circle' (where Nth is replaced by the
ordinal corresponding to eir Circle number).

For being a member of a Team winning the Team Competition, a Player
receives the SPT of 'Team Victor', except for the Team Captain who
receives the SPT of "Victorious Leader"

If two or more Teams are tied for the highest Team Score at the end
of a Round, their members receive the SPT of 'Team Pseudo-Victor'

If a Player Scores enough in a Round that e would have won at least
one of the Circles higher than that in which e competed, e receives
the SPT of 'Overachiever'.

If a Player Scores so low that e would have placed last in at least
one of the Circles below eir own e receives the SPT of 'Slacker'.

* Rule 755 'Champions' is hereby Repealed.

* Rule 1465 'Champion's Reward' is hereby Repealed.

* Rule 1498 'Winning by Blots' is hereby Repealed.

* Rule 1580 'Multiple Winners of a Single Game' is hereby Repealed.

* Rule 1622 'Forfeiting the Game' is hereby Repealed.

* Rule 1697 'Multiple rapid wins prohibited' is hereby Repealed.

* Amend Rule 1435  'Definition of Indulgences, Blots and Immaculate'
by removing the last sentence: "It is a Win-Preventing condition for a
Player to have one or more Blots."

* Amend Rule 1729 'Insanity' by replacing the last two lines with:

And should it occur (oh, need I say more?)
that no one Votes FOR it, the Proposer shall Score.

H. CotC,

I should have done it in the same message, but I realized afterwards
I should bar Andre from judging this CFJ, since e issued the PO.
I don't see anything in R897 that requires this to be done in the CFJ
message, so, if possible I hereby bar Andre from judging the CFJ
I just called.  If not possible, I hope you will use your discretion
to choose a different Judge anyway.

Regards,
Crito

H. CotC,

I meant to send the following to the PF.  I don't think this is necessary, but
just in case, I'm posting a copy here (it should not be construed as an
additional, duplicate CFJ).

Regards,
Crito

Ok.  H. CotC Steve take note,

I hereby submit the following CFJ:

The VT Payment Order labeled "RVTPO 822" in message
"Message-Id: <199902031535.QAA07830@wsinfm15.win.tue.nl>
Subject: OFF: Officer Salaries" (salary paid to Justiciar
Crito) was improperly executed.

Arguments:

R910 states "The Justiciar does not receive a fixed weekly salary."
R1007 states "Unless otherwise specified, the Salary for an Office
              shall be equal to the Basic Salary."
I contend that the above statement in R910 constitutes a specification
of the salary for the Justiciar.  Because the (lack of) salary is
specified in R910, the above statement in R1007 prevents it from
setting the salary of the Justiciar to the Basic Salary.  I should remind
the Judge that if e were to find this CFJ TRUE, e must then vacate the
referenced Payment Order.

  This message contains exactly one Proposal.  The Proposal begins
  immediately after the line marked "**START PROPOSAL" and ends at the
  end of the message.
  
  The following Proposal is to be titled "Cleanup of R.1445" and is to
have Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1445 be amended to read:

      (a) When an Election is required and the procedure is not
          defined elsewhere, the following Standard Election Procedure
          shall be used. Details specified herein are defaults which
          may be modified by other Rules for specific situations.
        (1) Vote Collector: The Vote Collector is the Entity
            responsible for taking nominations, collecting and
            tallying the Votes, and announcing the result.
          (A) Unless otherwise specified, this Entity is the Player
              who is Speaker at the time the Referendum starts.
          (B) If another Player is specified, this Player shall be the
              Vote Collector for the entire duration of the
              Referendum.
          (C) If the Vote Collector deregisters or is deregistered
              before the Voting Period ends, the Election has no
              Winner.
        (2) Nominating Entities: Every Player not on Hold may Nominate
            eirself in an Election. On Hold status is measured at the
            time a Player makes a Nomination.
        (3) Nominations: A Nominating Entity makes a Nomination by
            sending a message to the Vote Collector during the
            Nominating Period, indicating what Election e is
            Nominating for.
        (4) Candidates: A Player who has Nominated for an Election is
            called a Candidate for that Election.
        (5) Retraction: A Nomination, once sent to the Vote Collector,
            may be retracted before the end of the Nominating Period.
            A player may retract a Nomination e has made by sending a
            message to the Vote Collector, indicating that e wishes to
            retract eir Nomination.
        (6) Start of Nominations: The Nominating Period begins at the
            time of the first correct and legal announcement that the
            Election has begun, as required by the Rules calling for
            the Election.
        (7) Duration of Nominations: The Nominating Period lasts for
            one Week.  All Nominations received by the Vote Collector
            outside of the Nominating Period have no effect.
        (8) Secrecy: Nominations need not be kept secret.

      (b) Announcing Candidates: the Vote Collector shall announce to
          the Public Forum, as soon as possible after the Nominating
          Period is over, the names of all Players who Nominated for
          the Election.

      (c) If there are no Candidates in a given Election, then that
          Election shall have no Winner. If there is only one
          Candidate in a given Election, then that Candidate shall be
          the Winner of that Election.

      (d) In all other cases, a Referendum shall being at the time
          Candidates are Announced, which shall be conducted using the
          standard procedure for Referendum Voting with the following
          exceptions:
        (1) Vote Collector: The Vote Collector for the Referendum is
            the same as the Vote Collector for the Election.
        (2) Vote Values: A Vote is the name of exactly one of the
            Candidates for the given Election. Words which are
            effectively synonymous with these are also permissible.
        (3) Adoption: The Winner of the Election is the Candidate for
            whom the most votes were cast. If there is more than one
            such candidate, the Speaker chooses one of those
            candidates as the winner, and must announce eir chosen
            candidate as winner to the Public Forum.
        (4) Quorum: Quorum shall be set at 50% of the eligible Voting
            Entities at the beginning of the Voting Period. If a
            smaller fraction voted, the Election has no Winner.

      (e) Nonperformance by Vote Collector: The Vote Collector must
          perform eir required duties, but if the result of an
          Election is not announced within one Week following the end
          of the Voting Period, the Election has no Winner.

      (f) Effective Time of Election Results: The results of an
          Election are effective at the time the results of the
          Referendum are announced; or, if there is no Referendum, at
          the time that the Vote Collector announces that there is to
          be no Referendum.

      (g) Cutoff for Challenges: Any challenge of the correctness of
          the announced results of an Election must be made within
          seven days of the time the results are announced.  If seven
          days pass from the time the results are announced without a
          challenge, the announced results are the true results of
          that Election, whether or not they be in error in any way.
