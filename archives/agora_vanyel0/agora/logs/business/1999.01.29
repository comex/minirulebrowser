This message contains exactly one Proposal.  The Proposal begins
immediately after the line marked "**START PROPOSAL" and ends at the
end of the message.

The following Proposal is to be titled "Simplify Probate" and is to
have Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it therefore resolved, that Rules 1637, 1738, 1739 and 1757 be
repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1601 be amended to read:

      (a) An entity is inanimate if it:
        (1) possesses any number of units of Currency, and
        (2) does not have an Executor.

      (b) The Notary may perform any of the following with respect to
          a inanimate entity:
        (1) transfer Currencies owned by the inanimate entity for the
            purpose of satisfying a Payment Order naming the inanimate
            entity as payor;
        (2) Without Objection, vacate any Payment Order naming the
            inanimate entity as payor or payee; or
        (3) Without Objection, transfer Currencies owned by that
            entity to the Bank.

      (c) The Notary is authorized, all other Rules notwithstanding,
          to transfer Currency from any inanimate entity to any other
          entity as if e were the inanimate entity's Executor, when e
          is permitted to do so in accordance with subdivision (b) of
          this Rule.

      (d) A inanimate entity is considered to continue to have legal
          existence as long as it continues to possess units of
          Currency, even if it is dissolved, destroyed, or otherwise
          would cease to have legal existence prior to that time.

I hereby declare Presence on Proposals 3827-3828. 

It'll be interesting to see how many actual votes Proposals can attract
with the Tariff set at 1.2 VTs...I hope that "A Duty to Vote" has
passed, although I think that it hasn't.

I don't save the messages I receive as administrator of the gecko lists
telling me that people have subscribed or unsubscribed from the lists,
so unfortunately, I can't give a completely authoritative answer to your
question. Perhaps I should save them in future.

Nevertheless, to the best of my knowledge, all Players who were
registered on January 23 were subscribed to agora-discussion at that
time, and I'd say I'm about 80-90% confident that that assertion is true.

I ask any Player with information to the contrary to come forward now.
