Hi all, 

a voice recently adopted by the Priests of the Order allows (and
requires) me to publish the following.

As High Priest and Executor of the Order I hereby destroy the currency
called Irises (this doesn't hurt anyone outside of the Order, as
Harlequin and me were the only owners of Irises).

I then create a new currency, again called Irises, with a MUQ of 0.01.

I create 10 Irises, which are under control of the Order for a start. 

Now comes the good part: All of you, even non-members of the Order,
can get Irises as tokens for VTs which you deposit with the
order. I'll leave it to you all to figure out why it might be nice to
do so ;).

Because the order may have to pay taxes on the VTs you deposit, there
is a small fee, called the Iris Exchange Tariff (IET), which I hereby
set to 9%. This percentage of your deposit will be kept by the
Order. The rest of your deposit is available to you when you return
the Irises you got for depositing the VT.

The relevant Ordinances of the Order are attached. 

The bank is open - send any business transaction to Kolja A., your
friendly High Priest and banking clerk.

Kolja A.


Att: Excerpt from the Order's Ordinances, concerning Iris transactions
with the general public (i.e. excluding Order-internal membership fees
etc)

#3: Irises

  The Order mints a Currency called the "Iris."  The MUQ of the Iris is .01.
  There is also an Iris Exchange Tariff, expressed as a percentage from 0 to
  100, which the High Priest may change at any time by posting the current
  Tariff to the Public Forum.  The initial value of the IET is 5%.  Whenever a
  Player transfers VTs to the Order (other than in satisfaction of a Tithe
  Payment Order), the High Priest shall, as soon as possible, transfer to that
  Player a number of Irises equivalent to the number of VTs, minus the IET if
  the Player is not a member of the Order.  A percentage, equal to the IET, of
  such VTs transferred to the Order by non-members is placed in the Tithe Fund
  and the remainder is placed in the Banking Fund.  All such VTs transferred
  to the Order by members are placed in the Banking Fund.

#8: Cashing Irises and Directed Voting 

  Whenever a Priest or Initiate transfers Irises to the Order, e may request
  either a VT Refund or Directed Votes.  The High Priest shall honor this
  request as soon as possible after receiving such a transfer.  VT Refunds are
  honored by transferring to the requestor a number of VTs from the Order's
  Banking Fund equivalent to the number of Irises transferred with the
  request.  Directed Votes are honored by casting votes as directed by the
  requestor, using a number of VTs from the Banking Fund equivalent to the
  number of Irises transferred with the request.  Directed Votes may only be
  honored if the following conditions are true for each relevant Proposal:

    1.  The Player has not already directed a vote on the Proposal.
    2.  There are at least four days left in the Voting Period of the Proposal.
    3.  There have not already been two Directed Votes on the Proposal.

  If a Directed Vote request cannot be honored in full, then it shall be
  treated as a VT Refund request.  Whenever a non-member transfers Irises to
  the Order, it shall be considered a VT Refund request.
