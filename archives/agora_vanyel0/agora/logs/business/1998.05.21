Obviously, this should read "arbitrary private order."
I apologize to the Judge for the typo.

I hereby Call for Judgement on the following Statement :

----------------------------------------

An Order, as defined in Rule 1793, and of whatever type, is "a Nomic
Entity created in accordance with the Rules" in the sense of Rule
1513 and as such is subject to the limitations set forth in that
Rule, and in particular that Orders derive coercive power from some
Rules and that the Rules take precedence over Orders whenever an
Order conflicts with a Rule. 

----------------------------------------

R&A : 

I can easily predict that we'll have a hard time dealing with
Swann's recent posts unless we hare a clear notion of how to deal
with Orders as a whole. I propose the above principle, with Orders
being NREs deriving coercive power from, specifically, Rules 1810 and
1811 (although that may be debated, which is why I didn't make the
CFJ dependent on that).

The rationale for that principle is that insofar as the Rules can be
said to "compel" or "prohibit" certain actions which are non-
retractable Moves, the instrument of such coercion is the threat of
being cited for a Crime or Infraction. Thus a Rule which makes a
Crime or Infraction of some action or inaction which is defined in
some body of text other than the Rules themselves can be said to
grant coercive power to that body of text, which brings it under the
purview of Rule 1513.

Thus, an Order prohibiting a Player from Calling for Judgement,
which is what the Orders in "Here we go..." effectively do, is in
conflict with Rule 911, and as such shall be deemed invalid; most
of Swann's other Orders are dealt with similarly, or at the least
innocuuous given that the higher-precedence judicial framework
is preserved by the NRE principle. Conversely, the NRE principle
does not rob other Orders of their effectiveness, and will not 
require huge patching up of the Orders Rules to close supposed
loopholes therein.

Ineligibility

H. CotC,

Unfortunately, my RL situation is going to interfere with my ability to
concentrate on more than my Officer duties for the moment.  As much as I would
love to get involved with the current discussion of Swann's scam, the CFJ's,
and their implications, I just don't have time to give them the careful thought
and attention they require.  Therefore it is with deep regret that I make
myself ineligible to judge the three CFJ's just recently made - "Coup d'etat
CFJ", "Coup d'etat CFJ II", and "One more CFJ...".

Regretfully,
Crito

This Week with R-O-M

There are still 339 Rules in the current Rule set by my count.  The five random
numbers this week are:

 37 = Rule 1789 Cantus Cygneus
 20 = Rule 1750 Read the Ruleset Week
128 = Rule 1793 Orders
256 = Rule 1542 Style Points
156 = Rule  217 Judgements Must Accord with the Rules

Considering the current situation, I'm tempted to select Rule 1793.  8)  But
making it work consistently would be too much for the poor R-O-M at this time.
Even though I have a certain affection for Rule 1789 8), I imagine it to be
considered a "white elephant" by most Players.  So that is my selection.

Acting as Executor and on behalf of the Repeal-O-Matic, I hereby submit the
following proposal:

PROPOSAL: Repeal Rule 1789 (Cantus Cygneus)

This Proposal shall have an AI = 1

Rule 1789 is hereby Repealed.

There having been no objection to my plan, I hereby implement it.

Interestingly, the passage of Plots destroyed all of Jester's assets.  As e had
no outstanding debts or credits, the only thing that remains for me to do is to
announce that the implementation of Jester's probate is complete and Jester is
no longer in probate.

I agree with this, an I hereby transfer a Kudo from myself to Steve

This is the start of my Proto to fix the Order Rules.  It is
unfinished, but I solicit comments as I progress on it.  This is
missing the megalomaniacal aspects that I'll include once I get the
fix itself down pat.

PROTO: Order Repair. (this proposal shall have AI=3)
------------------------------------------------------------------

Let the following rule be created with a Power=2;
(Title: Automatically Invalid Orders)

     An Order shall be invalidated upon its execution if any of the 
     following is true of it;

       i) It seeks to hinder the appeal of itself or some other Order
      ii) It seeks to hinder the stay, vacation or amendment of itself 
          or another Order.
     iii) The Order itself is in direct violation of one or more Rules.
      iv) It seeks to compel, or forbid, the performance of any duty
          required or permitted of a Player solely by the virtue of that
          Player being a Judge or Justice.
       v) It seeks to forbid any Player from submitting a CFJ, appealing
          a CFJ, or sumbitting a Motion.


Let the following Rule be created with a Power=2;
(Title: Precidence of Orders)

     Orders have precidence in relation to their class as follows;

       i) Administrative Orders have precidence over Private Orders.
      ii) Judicial Orders have precidence over Administrative Orders and 
          Private Orders.
     iii) Appellate Orders have precedence over all other Orders.

     An Order can only affect the operation of another Order when the 
     Order so affected does not take precedence over it.


Rule 1796 is amended to read as follows;

      All Administrative, Judical, and Appelate Orders executed in the
      manner prescribed by the Rules for their class and type are 
      presumed valid and enforceable until proven otherwise by CFJ.

      Any Private Order that is of a type not explicitly permitted by
      the Rules is presumed invalid until proven otherwise by CFJ.

      In order to be proven valid by CFJ, the Rules must permit the
      Player who executed the Order in question to execute such an
      Order, that the execution of the Order must have been required
      by or permitted in the circumstances which existed at the time
      it was executed, and that the Order has not been rendered
      invalid by the operation of any other Rule.
