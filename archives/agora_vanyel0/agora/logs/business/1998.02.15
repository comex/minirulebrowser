I note, a little drily, that when a Revolt occurred while I was
Registrar, I conducted the Elections without complaint, and without
making Kudo transfers.

I hereby transfer a Kudo, 

FROM Michael, for complaining about having to do his job,
TO   General Chaos, for sterling work as Assessor and Chancellor.

Herald, I hereby transfer one Kudo from G.Chaos for effectively negating
the
penalty of Michael's first (legitimately reasoned) Kudo transfer,
without giving
a satisfactory reason for the transfer to Steve. I transfer this Kudo to
Sherlock as e has been making an effort to contribute to the game. (My
little
contribution towards the game's greatest assets)

Herald, I hereby transfer one Kudo from Time Agent to G.Chaos as this
effectively reverses the original 'bad' transfer. I transfer the Kudo
from Time
Agent as I believe that Kudos should be given for a reason and the Kudo
in
question was not given with reasonable justification. I transfer it to
G.Chaos
as I beleive that Kudos should be taken for a reason and the Kudo in
question
was not taken without reasonable justification.

Herald, lastly I transfer one Kudo from myself to Time Agent. I transfer
it from
myself as I have still not read the ruleset completely (despite RTRW and
the
best intentions). I transfer it to Time Agent as e also has been making
an
effort to contribute to the game. (My other little contribution towards
the
game's greatest assets)

In light of the new version of Rule 1623, I find that I need to know
whether the text of the messages in which Proposals 3688, 3689, and
3691 (all marked as Disinterested when distributed) were submitted
explicitly stated that those Proposals were Disinterested.

(This may prove especially problematic for Proposal 3688, which was
not submitted by a message.  Now do you all see why I dislike the
Repeal-O-Matic's presumption of submission?)
