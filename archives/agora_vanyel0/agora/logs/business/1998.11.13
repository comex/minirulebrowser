I hereby declare presence in the Notary election.

Why did I nominate for this job?

One, I was expecting the Ambassador's job to become redundant. I
support Scott's door slamming proposal, because IN is essentially dead
and I don't see a stable new start anywhere (so much for the
inter-nomic trade agreement and similar enthusiasm...). So I am
looking for a new job as a source of income and as something
purposeful to do. 

Secondly, I had the impression that Murphy was just barely able to
fulfill his obligations. I was not sure whether this was due to
technical problems (his access to the mailing lists), or to RL demands
and/or lack of interest on his side. By now it looks as if it was the
former, and I don't want to criticize him in any way for the job he's
been doing so far. 

So I guess there will be no big election promises from me, and the
choice is essentially yours...

Kolja A.

Re: OFF: CFJ 1109 re-assigned to Crito

Thank you, Blob, for the copy of the original PO message.  Unfortunately, it
looks like Lee will be unable to get me any further information I need to make
a determination of True or False (not that I blame em), especially since the
#$%^ Lan managers here are going to blow away e-mail service for the entire
weekend again.

There is one possibility, however.  Scott, if you could provide me with an
accurate count of the number of votes you have cast since August 1, I may be
able to render a judgement that fits the "preponderance of evidence" standard.

Otherwise, I'm afraid the only course for me will be to dismiss this CFJ,
unless I can manage to get enough information from the archives in time.
