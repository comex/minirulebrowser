I hereby claim the above two statements to be in error, as no Transfer Orders
or Payment Orders having been minted, none can have been executed.

I further submit the following CFJ :

No Transfer Orders have thus far been successfully executed, for the reason 
that none exist.

I further submit the following CFJ :

No Payment Orders have thus far been successfully executed, for the reason that
none exist.

Please note that whatever the truth value of the second of the above CFJs, any
Payment Orders that might have been executed hitherto will be Disputed
starting at the time when the CotC selects a Judge - and, it seems, will
remain so indefinitely (as far as I know, a CFJ never ceases to exist, and I
see no reason to believe that a CFJ assigned to a Judge ever ceases to be
assigned to that Judge; persistence of entities is definitely something we 
should look into).

All this talk about Blots and POs makes me think that perhaps we
should define the difference between a class of Entities and an
individual Entity. This is probably too long, and I don't know if the
benefit is worth the effort, but... Anyway, this also fixes up
"Proposing Entities" and "Voting Entities" to make it clear that
either is a property that any Entity may possess.

####
PROTO-Proposal: Entity Classes

Amend Rule 1586 ("Definition and Continuity of Entities") to read:

      A "Nomic Entity" is an individual entity which has no 
      discernible existence without the Rules, only existing by 
      virtue of the Rules defining it to exist.  

      An "Entity Class" is an Entity which consists of a group of 
      Nomic Entities. Any number of Nomic Entities belonging to a 
      certain Entity Class may exist, unless another Rule requires 
      for there to be a specific number or range of numbers. A 
      Nomic Entity belongs to an Entity Class only if so defined 
      by the Rules.

      Each Entity Class has a unique name, by which instances of that
      Entity Class may be unambiguously referred. No two Entity 
      Classes may have the same name.

      Rules may define the existence of Entity Classes by stating 
      the name of the Class and the properties common to all
      Entities of that Class.

      When the Rules defining a given Entity Class are repealed or
      amended such that they no longer define Entities of that Class, 
      all Entities of that Class ceases to exist, along with any 
      properties it may have possessed.

      When the Rules defining a given Entity Class are amended such
      that they still define the Class but in a different way or with
      different properties, all instances of that Class and its 
      properties continue to exist to whatever extent is possible
under 
      the new definition.

Amend Rule 1062 ("Kudos and Honour") by replacing the text:

      Let there be an Entity called the Kudo (plural: Kudos). 

with the text:

      Let there be an Entity Class known as "Kudos."

Amend Rule 1274 ("Definition of Indices") by replacing the text:

      Let there be a class of Entities known as "Indices" (singular:
      "Index").  

with the text:

      Let there be an Entity Class known as "Indices" (singular:
      "Index").

Amend Rule 1528 ("Organizations") by replacing the text:

      There are entities known as Organizations.

with the text:

      Let there be an Entity Class known as "Organizations."

Amend Rule 1369 ("Theses") by replacing the text:

      There shall be a Nomic Entity known as a Thesis, plural Theses.

with the text:

      There shall be an Entity Class known as Theses, singular Thesis.

Amend Rule 1706 ("Locations") by replacing the text:

      There is a class of Entities called Locations.

with the text:

      There is an Entity Class called "Locations."

Amend Rule 649 ("Patent Titles") by replacing the text:

      There is a class of entities known as Patent Titles.  

with the text:

      There is an Entity Class known as "Patent Titles."

Amend Rule 1542 ("Style Points") by replacing the text:

      There are Entities known as Style Points.  

with the text:

      There is an Entity Class known as "Style Points."

Amend Rule 1467 ("Definition of a Currency") by replacing the text:

      There are certain entities which are Currencies.  An entity is a
      Currency if and only if it has been made such by the Rules, and
      if and only if it complies with all the requirements in the
      Rules pertaining to Currencies.

with the text:

      There is an Entity Class known as "Currencies." An Entity may
      be a Currency only if it is itself an Entity Class, if and
      only if it is made a Currency by the Rules, and if and only if
      it and all Entities contained within it comply with all the
      requirements in the Rules pertaining to Currencies.

Repeal Rule 1567 ("Names of Currencies")

Amend Rule 1605 ("Proposing Entities") by replacing the text:

      Let there exist a type of entity called a Proposing Entity.
      Only Proposing Entities have the right to make Proposals,

with the text:

      There is a property known as "Proposing." The term
      "Proposing Entity" can unambiguously refer to any
      Entity with the Property of Proposing. Only Proposing
      Entities may make Proposals.

Amend Rule 206 ("Voting Entities and Votes") by replacing the text:

      A Voting Entity is an Entity which is generally authorized by
      the Rules to cast a vote or votes on a Proposal, although other
      Rules may withdraw this authorization from a Voting Entity in
      specific circumstances without that Entity thereby ceasing to
      be a Voting Entity. 

with the text:

      There is a property known as "Voting." The term "Voting Entity" 
      can unambiguously refer to any Entity with the Property of 
      Voting. Voting Entities are generally authorized by the Rules 
      to cast a vote or votes on a Proposal, although other Rules 
      may withdraw this authorization from a Voting Entity in specific

      circumstances without that Entity thereby ceasing to be a Voting

      Entity. 

and the text:

      The casting of any votes may only be achieved by the casting
      of Voting Tokens, as specified in other Rules.

with the text:

      The casting of any votes may only be achieved by the spending
      of Voting Tokens, as specified in other Rules.

Proposal: Paris Fashions

I got positive feedback from Michael on this, so I will go ahead and propose
it.  This makes Style points stick around and has the Wizard keep track of the
highest number of Style points each Player has ever had.  The P-note reward is
changed to give 1 P-note for every two Style points you get above your previous
high.  I removed the quarterly reset but fixed it so that current Players will
get the reward for any Style points they have earned since July 1.

H. Promotor take note:

I make the following proposal and then submit a Transfer Order for 1 P-note
from myself to the Bank to pay the Proposal Fee on this proposal.

-------------------------
Proposal
Paris Fashions

Amend Rule 1542 to read as follows:

      There are Entities known as Style Points.  All Players possess
      an integral number of Style Points that is positive, negative or
      zero.  The number of Style Points a Player has is that Player's
      Style. Any new Player, or a Player with no recorded Style
      Points, begins with a Style of zero.

      Each Player also has a High Style Mark.  Any new Player, or a
      Player with no recorded High Style Mark, begins with a High
      Style Mark of zero.

      Every time a Proposal is distributed, the Wizard has the option
      of changing the Style of the Player who submitted that Proposal,
      as long as that Player is not the Wizard.  The Wizard may only
      change the Style of Players whose Proposals were distributed
      after e became Wizard.

      The Wizard may add or subtract up to three Style Points from the
      Proposer's Style for any reason having to do with the form,
      content, effects, or nature of the Proposal-- but, for the
      change to have effect, such reasons must be included in eir
      Wizard's Report, as provided for in other Rules.

      Whenever a Player's Style points exceeds eir High Style Mark by
      two or more points, the Wizard shall pay out to that Player a
      reward of one P-Note for every two points in excess of eir current
      High Style Mark and eir High Style Mark shall be increased by two
      times the number of P-Notes awarded.

      A Player's Style and High Style Mark can only change as provided
      for in this Rule.

Amend Rule 1543 to read as follows:

      There is a Player known as the Wizard.  The Wizard is the Player
      in charge of maintaining a record of each Player's Style.  The
      Wizard must post in the Public Forum, at least once a week, a
      report which includes:

         i) The Style of every Player.
        ii) The High Style Mark of every Player.
       iii) All Style changes, and the values of those changes, since
            the last Wizard's Report.
        iv) The Proposal numbers of every Proposal that merited a
            Style change.
         v) The reasons for each change.

      The Wizard shall, in each Nomic Week in which e produces a
      Wizard's Report, pay out one P-Note to emself as compensation
      for his duties.

Repeal Rule 1705

I was sure there was a CFJ on a matter similar to this. Anyway, if it turns
out that Crito is right, I'll write up a new version of the Rule. Anyway,
we should get some closure on it.

Therefore, I make the following CFJ, barring Crito and Steve (gotta be
fair, after all :) 

####
Statement: A unit of the currency "Payment Orders" is a Nomic Entity.
####

I've given my arguments all over n-d, so I won't repeat any of them here.
The relevant Rules are: 1467, 1591, 1586.

This is in error.  A Proposal which passes is adopted at the end of
its Voting Period, and all awards contingent on its adoption take
place at that time.  However, its _effects_ do not take place until
the Assessor announces the results.  Therefore, the awards above were
awarded at Sun, 13 July 1997 14:06:44 UTC, under the prior Rules, and
were duly reported by myself in my Report announcing the results of
those Proposals.  Your report is therefore in error by not including
these transfers.
