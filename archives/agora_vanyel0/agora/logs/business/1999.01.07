Proposal: Actions With N Supporters

Create a rule, with title "Actions With N Supporters", and text:

      Certain changes to Nomic Properties may be made With N
      Supporters, where N is an integer between one and five
      inclusive, specifying how many supporters are necessary to
      allow the change to take place. Only those changes explicitly
      allowed by other Rules may be so made, and in order for such
      a change to take effect, the Rule allowing the change must
      explicitly state which Player or Players are authorized to
      make the change. If such a Rule does not specify a value for N
      between one and five, the value of N is one. For brevity's
      sake, the term "With Support" shall be taken as meaning
      "With one Supporter".

      In order to make a change With N Supporters, a Player
      authorized to make a given change With N Supporters must
      first post to the Public Forum eir intent to make such a change,
      unambiguously describing the change to be made. The change then
      takes place when a Player authorized to make that change With
      N Supporters (who need not be the same player who posted eir
      intent to make the change) posts to the Public Forum that that
      change is made, and the following conditions are fulfilled:

      (a) the post announcing the change is made no fewer than four
          days after, nor more than fourteen days after, the post
          announcing the intent to make the change;

      (b) between the two posts, N or more Players posted to the
          Public Forum supporting the change.

      This Rule defers to Rules which place further restrictions
      on the effectiveness of changes made With Supporters.

Proposal: Auctions

Create a rule, with title "Default Procedure for Auctions", and text:

      When an Auction is required and the procedure is not defined
      elsewhere, the following standard Auction procedure shall be
      used. Details specified herein are defaults which may be
      modified by other Rules for specific situations.

      Auctioneer: The Auctioneer is the Entity responsible for
      collecting bids and announcing the result of the Auction.
      This Entity is the Speaker if not otherwise specified.

      Bidders: Every Player not on Hold may Bid in an Auction.
      On Hold status is measured at the time a Player sends eir
      Bid.

      Auction Currency: Each Auction is conducted in one particular
      currency. Unless otherwise specified, the Auction Currency is
      the Voting Token.

      Start of Auction: The Auction begins at the time the
      first correct and legal announcement that an Auction is
      begun, as defined in other Rules, is sent to the Public
      Forum, together with the identity of the Auctioneer, the
      Auction Currency, and the value of the Starting Bid.

      Starting Bid: The Starting Bid is the minimum possible
      value of a bid. If not otherwise specified, the Stating Bid
      is equal to the MUQ of the Auction Currency.

      Making Bids: Each Bidder may make as many Bids as e desires
      during the Auction. A Bid is a message, sent to the Public
      Forum, announcing that the sender is bidding in that
      particular Auction, and the amount of eir Bid. A Bid is only
      valid if it satisfies the following conditions:

          (1) The Bid is not made before the start of the
              Auction, or after its end.
          (2) The amount Bid is a multiple of the MUQ of the
              Auction Currency.
          (3) The amount Bid is no less than the Starting Bid.
          (4) The Bid is larger than any other valid Bid made
              so far in the Auction.

      End of Auction: If, one week after the Auction started,
      there have been no Bids made. The Auction ends, and has no
      winner. Otherwise the Auction ends when 24 hours has passed
      without a valid Bid having been made.

      The Winner: When the Auction ends, the Bidder who made the
      largest valid Bid in the Auction is the Winner. The
      Auctioneer shall announce the Winner of the Auction as soon
      as possible after the end of the Auction, and shall issue
      a Payment Order from the Winner to the Bank, for an amount
      equal to the size of the winning Bid.

Create a rule, with title "Private Auctions", and text:

      If an Auction is designated by the rules as being Private,
      then Bids may only made by sending them privately to the
      Auctioneer. This rule takes precedence over the standard
      Auction procedure.
