I did send you a dismissal of CFJ 963 several days ago. I hope you can find
it, because I have no other proof of having sent it.

In case that doesn't show up, I hereby dismiss CFJ 963 under R1563, and
under Rule 1565(iii) and (vi).

Has the Chancellor posted a Schedule of Currencies (per Rule 1721) during
September 1997?  The last one I received is dated August 10, 1997.

I believe that the Schedule would be a subset of the following:

Currency           Mintor     Recordkeepor     MUQ
--------------------------------------------------
Voting Tokens      Bank       Assessor         0.1

Calabresi is apparently about to be deregistered for inactivity, but I
won't be back from work in time to assign em an Executor in Probate
before the end of the month (UTC) - and if it doesn't happen by then,
then we can't have any fun with the new zombie for another month.

Therefore, I hereby delegate the Office of Notary to Andre for a period
of 24 hours, if e is willing.

Oh, hell, why doesn't somebody do the following.

I hereby make a Call For Judgment on the following statement, barring
Oerjan and Morendil:

Statement: The Rules lack agency.

Argument: The Rules derive their authority from the General Will of all
the Players. Any appearance of agency then seem to have is derived from
that authority. 
----------------------------------------------
I invite other Players to contribute their arguments.
