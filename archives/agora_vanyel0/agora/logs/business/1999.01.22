I think those '98's should be '94's.

>I hope this makes Steve happy.

Very happy. And may I say again what a masterful job you've done
bringing order to what must have been an enormous amount of primary
material. I am glad that we have the services of a professional
historian, which is what I guess you must be, judging by your .sig.

I therefore submit the following Proposal, to have an Adoption Index of
2, and pay 1 P-Note to the Bank to raise its Priority to one (H.
Promotor General Chaos, please note):

####
Proposal
Vlad the Historian

In recognition and appreciation of his masterful research into early
Agoran history, be it hereby resolved that the Agoran community bestow
upon Vlad, aka Scott de Brestian, the Unique Patent Title of Historian.

Be it further resolved that Vlad be awarded the Degree of Doctor of
Nomic History for his Thesis, published in two parts, entitled
'Prolegomena to the Study of Early Agoran History'.

####

Vlad, please be advised that in order to qualify for the Degree, you
will have to repost both parts of your Prolegomena, with statements to
the effect that they constitute a Thesis being submitted with the
intention of qualifying for the Degree of Doctor of Nomic History. See
R1370.

elJefe and Macross have now both committed the Infraction of Failure
to Propose and are both ordered to pay to the Bank 1 P-Note and 1
Indulgence, pursuant to Rule 1865.

(There is a sense of irony that Macross, the inventor of the Duty to
Propose, should be guilty of failing to do so.)

Recap of Payment Orders:

ident      payor       payee      curr  amt
PR2032.01  elJefe      the Bank   PN    1
PR2032.02  elJefe      the Bank   Ind.  1
PR2032.03  Macross     the Bank   PN    1
PR2032.04  Macross     the Bank   Ind.  1
