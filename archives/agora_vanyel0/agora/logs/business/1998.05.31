I transfer 3 VTs to the Bank to satisfy this PO, if it is legal for me to do
so, and if it has not already been satisfied.

     THE AGORAN WEEKLY JOURNAL
     VOLUME 43, ISSUE 11
     Sunday edition
     May 31, 1998


PROPOSALS
---------

5/20-31  Swann, Macross, and others issue and amend dozens of Orders
           prohibiting various other players from performing various
           sorts of Order-related acts.  Swann also protoes several
           versions of "Order Repair" and stated that, when e Proposes
           it, e plans to Order all Players to vote FOR it and refrain
           from voting AGAINST it.  ("Order Repair" will, of course,
           give Swann and Macross each a Win and Patent Title, then
           close the loophole.)

5/20  Crito admits a COE regarding the title of Proposal 3749, but
        claims that it is "The Levers of Monetary Policy"; it is
        actually "More Fun with Priority".

5/21  The Repeal-O-Matic Proposes the repeal of Rule 1789 (Cantus
        Cygneus).

5/22  Voting on Proposals 3747-3748 has ended.  These Proposals are
        adopted:
          3747 [Steve] The Levers of Monetary Policy

      Michael Proposes "Repeal the Archivist".

5/23  Swann protoes "Make Strategic Criminal Actions Truly Illegal".

5/26  Crito admits a COE and gives the correct title of Proposal 3749
        ("More Fun with Priority").

5/27  These Proposals are distributed:
        3752 [Crito]  Discard Disinterest
        3753 [Murphy] Plot Repair
        3754 [Steve]  Reinstate unemployment benefits

      The Repeal-O-Matic Proposes the repeal of Rule 1730 (Delayed
        Transfer Orders).

5/28  Blob protoes "Repair & Retune Plots".

5/31  Voting on Proposals 3750-3751 has ended.  Both Proposals fail to
        meet Quorum.

         5/22-29  Assigned to Steve, who Judges TRUE

          'Coup d'itat' were valid."

CFJ 1095 [Swann]
         5/22-31  Assigned to Murphy, who disqualifies emself

CFJ 1096 [Morendil]
         5/22  Assigned to Harlequin
         "An Order, as defined in Rule 1793, and of whatever type, is
          'a Nomic Entity created in accordance with the Rules' in the
          sense of Rule 1513 and as such is subject to the limitations
          set forth in that Rule, and in particular that Orders derive
          coercive power from some Rules and that the Rules take
          precedence over Orders whenever an Order conflicts with a
          Rule."

CFJ 1097?[Swann]
         5/22  Called
         "Player Swann committed the crime of Contempt by Action."

CFJ 1098?[Macross]

          from using words that are not spelled the same
          backwards as forwards when issuing any Administrative,
          Judicial, Appellate or Private Orders unless the
          issuing of those Orders is explicitly required of
          'em by the Rules or by an Order issued by Player

I disqualify myself as Judge of CFJ 1095.  I've been having mail troubles
for several days in a row and I've got plenty of other things to worry
about.
