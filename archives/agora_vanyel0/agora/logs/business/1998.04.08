Oh wow. How embarrassing. Forgot to put on my reading glasses again,
did I ? <hangs head in shame>.

Hm, H. Herald, please note a transfer of one Kudo FROM myself, for 
being an utter pinhead, TO Michael, as a token of my appreciation for 
his work as CotC.

As Clerk of the Courts, I return the following decision: 

My fellow Justices have done all of original thinking on this
question.  This is appropriate because my own position is somewhat
compromised by my position as Judge of the similar CFJ 1090.  I agree
with the conclusions reached by Steve and Morendil and my ultimate
decision is to sustain Kolja's original reasoning.

My own instinct as to the best way of deciding whether or not two
texts are the same is to perform a "diff" modulo any explicit
provisions granted by the rules.  My fellow Justices seem averse to
this idea, and have come up with alternative ways of demonstrating
that the relevant texts in this case are different.  Particularly
compelling is the demonstration that the meanings of the two texts are
different, in the sense that if they were to be adopted, their effects
on the game would be different.

(This argument, an extensional one, appeals to the fact that if f(x)
is not equal to f(y) then x is not equal to y, where x and y are our
texts and f is our function for constructing the meaning of our
texts.)

I am happy with the intensional argument to the effect that 
  i) the two texts in this case are demonstrably different, and
 ii) the rules do not allow us to consider them the same.

In any case, the original judgement is clearly correct. 

Michael.

Since the Election is evidently for CotC and not for Cartographor,
I hereby vote for Michael.
