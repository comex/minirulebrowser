I'm afraid I didn't think carefully enough about when I should time my
Delegations, particularly for Assessor. I should have started them
sometime during the day here, so I could be sure that no votes had been
sent to me that would need to be forwarded to my Delegate, Chuck.

Well, it occurs to me that it's not too late to this, so I hereby
Delegate the Office of Assessor to Chuck, to commence 1200 Friday,
Jul 10, GMT +1000 and to conclude 0000 Monday Jul 20, GMT +1000.

I advise voters not to send votes to me after midday tomorrow, GMT
+1000.

I consent to this delegation.

Just so everyone knows, I'll be out of town from Thursday evening
until Monday evening.  I'm not sure yet whether I'll have
net access while I'm away, so Proposal results may be delayed
until after I get back.
