Proposal: A collection of small fixes.

[Comment: I have collected together a number of recent proto's I
 have made, into a single proposal, in the hope that people will
 think it is worth spending VTs on.]

Amend Rule 1837 ("The Miscreant") to read:

      Let there exist the Patent Title of "Miscreant".

      If any Player has more than ten Blots, the Player with the most
      Blots earns the Title of Miscreant.  If no Player has the most
      number of Blots, there is no Miscreant.  The Miscreant loses
      eir Title of Miscreant if eir number of Blots drops below ten,
      if another Player gains as many Blots as em, or if another
      Player gains more Blots than em.

      The Herald shall announce in the Public Forum whenever a Player
      receives or loses this Title, as soon as possible after such
      award or revocation occurs.

      A Player with the Title Miscreant counts as two Rebellious 
      Players when determining the outcome of a Revolt. This rule
      takes precedence over any other rule determining the outcome
      of a Revolt.

[Comment: Add a reporting requirement, as per the Samurai, and also
 a precedence clause, so that the last paragraph actually works.]

Amend Rule 879 ("Quorum") to read:

      Quorum for a Proposal is achieved if a vote is cast on that
      Proposal by one-third of Active Players not denied voting 
      privileges, or one-fifth of all Players, whichever is greater.

      Quorum for a Proposal is calculated at the beginning of the 
      prescribed Voting Period for that Proposal, using information
      current at that time.

[Comment: If there are a lot of people who can't vote, it makes
 achieving Quorum rather difficult. This eases the burden.]

Amend Rule 1632 ("InterNomic Voting Procedure") by replacing the text:

      The InterNomic Vote shall be FOR if the Referendum on that
      Proposal has passed and AGAINST if the Referendum on that
      Proposal has failed. If the Referendum on that Proposal is
      undecided, then Agora shall abstain from voting on that
      Proposal.

with:

      The InterNomic Vote shall be FOR if the Referendum on that
      Proposal has passed and AGAINST if the Referendum on that
      Proposal has failed. If the Referendum on that Proposal is
      undecided, then the Ambassador may decide how Agora votes,
      as e sees fit.

[Comment: Not exactly a fix, but a toned down version of my previous
 attempt to empower the Ambasssador. Now e only has power to choose
 when the voting public are too apathetic to tell him how to vote.]

Proprosal: The Voting Tariff

Crete a rule, entitled "The Voting Tariff", with text:

      The Voting Tariff is a number of VTs, a multiple of the
      MUQ, between 0.5 and 2.0 inclusive. Unless the Rules give
      it another value, the Voting Tariff is 1 VT.

      The Assessor may change the value of the Voting Tariff by
      announcing the new value in the Public Forum, provided that
      e announces a value within the range proscribed above, that
      e makes the announcement prior to midnight GMT Thursday, and 
      that e has not already made such an announcement earlier in 
      the Week. The new value of the Voting Tariff does not take
      effect until the beginning of the Nomic Week after the
      change has been announced.

Amend rule Rule 1442 ("The Cost of Voting") to read:

      Proposals have a voting cost, equal to the Voting Tariff
      at the time they were distributed. If there was no value
      set for the Voting Tariff at that time, then the voting
      cost is 1 VT.

      As soon as possible after the end of the Voting Period of a
      given Proposal, the Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity a
      number of Voting Tokens equal to the votes cast on that
      Proposal by that entity multiplied by the voting cost for
      that Proposal.

[Comment: Yet another parameter for the economy. Gives us a way 
 to handle voting slumps, like the present one, by making voting
 cheaper. But Votes are still valuable, because of the danger that
 prices will go up.]
