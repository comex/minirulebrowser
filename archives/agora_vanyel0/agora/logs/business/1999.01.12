I will be discontinuing <ford@bayside.net> (which is dying a slow death) and
using <ford@jps.net> until further notice.  H. Registrar, please note.

I will be getting Notary business back on track during the next few days.

I announce that the Office of Speaker-Elect is temporarily held by the
Promotor.

I open nominations for the Office of Registrar, unless an Election for that
Office is already in progress.

Is there anything else I'm supposed to do at this point?

Now that "Honour without Dishonour" has passed, I invite Players to send me
nominations whenever they think someone really deserves a Kudo but don't
think anyone really deserves to lose one.  If I agree, I'll use the Herald's
Privilege.  If not, I'll let you know why not.  Send nominations either privately
or publicly.
