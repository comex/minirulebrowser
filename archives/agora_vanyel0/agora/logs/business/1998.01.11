Here's a basic concept for a new proposal distribution system. It was
inspired by comments made to me by Michael, concerning the Westminster
system. The basic idea is that there is a limited number of proposals
distributed each week. Proposals that have not been distributed wait in
a Proposal Queue. Proposals in this queue are sorted first by Priority
and then by the order they were proposed.

All proposals start with zero Priority. Such proposals will never be
distributed until their priority increases. There are two ways to increase
prioirity. The first, and most common way, is for players to spend P-Notes.
Each P-Note spent increases priority by one point. The Promotor may also,
at eir discretion, increase the priority of one proposal a week.

The number of proposals distributed each week is deliberately small, so
that there will be some competition to get your proposal high up in the 
queue, which will require P-Note spending. 

The Promotor's Priviledge is designed to allow em to show some sympathy
on poorer players, so that eir proposals can still get distributed.

I realise that this is not quite completely implemented yet. The Proposal
Queue should be distributed as part of the Promotor's Report, but then 
there is the problem of distinguishing between the proposals that are
actually being "distributed" and those that are being posted as part of
the Queue.

I should also do something to repeal Proposal Fees, but I haven't worked
out what would be the best way to reword 1723 and 1724.

Any comments?

Proto-Proposal: A New Proposal System

Amend Rule 1036 ("Making And Distributing Proposals") to read:

      As soon as possible after the Promotor receives a new Proposal,
      e shall assign to it a Number as specified in other Rules.
      E shall then place this Proposal on the Proposal Queue.

      The Proposal Queue is a list of Proposals, sorted in order of
      descending Priority. Proposals of the same priority are
      listed in the order they were proposed.

      A Proposal's Priority is an integer value. All Proposals 
      initially have a Priority of zero. 
      
Change the title of Rule 1036 to "Making Proposals"

Create a rule, with title "Distributing Proposals", with text:

      Each week, the Promotor shall distribute a batch of Proposals.

      If there are five or fewer Proposals in the Proposal Queue
      having a Priority greater than zero, then the batch shall
      consist of all such Proposals.

      If there are more than five such proposals, then the batch shall
      consit of the first five such Proposals, in the order given by
      the Queue. 

      Once a Proposal is distributed, it is removed from the Proposal
      Queue.

      Promotor shall distribute each proposal in the batch to the 
      Public Forum, accompanied by its Number and  the identity of its 
      Proposing Entity.

      The failure of the Promotor to distribute any of the above
      accompaniments with a Proposal does not deprive the distribution
      of the Proposal of any legal effect. 

Create a rule, with title, "Increasing Priority", with text:

      A Player may increase the Priority of a proposal by notifying
      the Promotor that e does so, and paying a number of P-Notes to
      the Bank. For each P-Note e pays to the Bank, the Priority of 
      the Proposal is increased by one, provided that this transfer
      is not executed for any other purpose.

Create a rule, with title, "Promotor's Privilege", with text:

      At most once a week, the Promotor may increase the Priority of
      a single Proposal in the Proposal Queue by one, so long as
      e is not the Proposer of the Proposal.
