As my attempt to set the Tariff last week appears to have failed, and 
as the Chancellor still hasn't adjusted the BOS, I hereby set the
Voting Tariff for all Proposals distributed from next week onwards, to
0.5 VTs.

Ooops, it seems that I left out the "on behalf of the R-O-M" sentence.
I guess I just made this proposal myself. I still have to make it on
behalf of the R-O-M, so:

On behalf of the Repeal-O-Matic, I propose:

PROPOSAL: Repeal Rule 1748 (Awards for Internomic Proposals)
      This Proposal shall have an AI = 1
      Rule 1748 is hereby Repealed.

I also retract the proposal I made in the message quoted above.

This message contains one or more Proposals.  Each Proposal begins
immediately after a line marked "**START PROPOSAL" and ends
immediately before the first following line marked "**END PROPOSAL".

The following Proposal is to be titled "Restore Sanity" and is to have
Adoption Index 2.
**START PROPOSAL
NOTE: Text enclosed in right brackets has no legal significance and
      shall in no way affect the legality or efficacy of any part of
      this Proposal.

[This Proposal does not seek to eradicate either Voting Tokens or
 P-Notes; it merely removes them from having any role in the process
 of making or voting upon Proposals.  I will leave it for later to
 decide what should be done with the Currencies themselves.]

Be it hereby resolved, that Rule 206 ["Voting Entities and Votes"] be
      amended to read:

      (a) Each Player is entitled to cast at most one Vote upon each 
          Proposal.  

      (b) A Player may be deprived of the right to cast a Vote upon
          any one Proposal, or upon Proposals generally, by the Rules
          or by an Order issued pursuant to the Rules.

      (c) No entity other than a Player may cast Votes upon
          Proposals. 

      (d) The term "Voting Entity" is hereby declared to be synonymous
          with "Player", except where such construction would clearly
          not make sense.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1442 ["The Cost of Voting"] be
      repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1765 ["Attributing Additional
      Votes"] be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 683 be amended to read:

      (a) A Player casts a vote upon a Proposal by sending a message to
          the Assessor specifying the Vote e is casting and the Proposal
          upon which it is cast.  

      (b) A vote cast under this Rule must be one of FOR, AGAINST, or
          ABSTAIN, or an obvious synonym thereof.

      (c) Any attempt by a Player to cast a vote is void and without
          legal effect if: 
        (1) the attempt is made other than during the Voting Period of
            the Proposal in question,
        (2) the Player attempting to cast a Vote is barred from
            Voting upon that Proposal by the Rules or by an Order then
            in effect barring em from doing so, 
        (3) the Player attempting to cast a Vote has previously cast a
            vote (other than a vote made void by this subrule) upon
            that Proposal, or
        (4) the attempt violates, or if allowed would violate, this or
            any other Rule.

      (d) Votes, once cast according to this Rule, cannot be
          retracted, cancelled, or changed except when the Rules
          require it, and then only as required by the Rules.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1715 ["Announcing One's Presence"]
      be repealed.  [Presence is irrelevant with free voting.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1449 ["The Assessor"] be amended to
      read:

      There shall exist the Office of Assessor.  The Assessor shall
      receive a weekly salary equal to the Basic Officer Salary.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1824 ["Debt Voting"] be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1660 ["The Speaker's Vote"] be
      repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1760 ["Quorum Buyback"] be
      repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1723 ["Sanity"] be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1724 ["Urgent Proposals"] be
      repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1036 ["The Proposal Queue"] be
      amended, by replacing the word "zero" with "one" wherever it
      appears. 

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1771 ["Increasing Priority"] be
      amended to read:

      (a) Not more than once in any Nomic Week, each Player may select
          any one Proposal in the Proposal Queue and may increase or
          decrease the priority of that Proposal by one, by sending a
          message to the Promotor indicating the Proposal to be
          affected and whether that Proposal's priority is to be
          increased or decreased.

      (b) An attempt to change the Priority of a Proposal in the
          Proposal Queue shall be void and without legal effect if:
        (1) the Player who attempted it has already changed the
            priority of any Proposal during the same Nomic Week;
        (2) the attempt relates to a Proposal which is no longer in
            the Proposal Queue; or
        (3) the change attempted would result in the Proposal having a
            priority less than zero.

      (c) The Promotor and the Speaker shall each be permitted to
          exercise the right given by subrule (a) of this Rule twice
          in each week, instead of once.  However, if the same Player
          is both Promotor and Speaker, e may not exercise this right
          three times.  The remainder of this Rule shall be
          interpreted so as to be consistent with the intent of this
          subrule.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1772 ["Promotor's Privilege"] be
      repealed.  [The privilege is incorporated into the revised Rule
      1771.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1862 ["The Voting Tariff"] be
      repealed.


**END PROPOSAL

The following Proposal is to be titled "End the Conspiracy!" and is to
have Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
NOTE: Text enclosed in right brackets has no legal significance and
      shall in no way affect the legality or efficacy of any part of
      this Proposal.

Be it hereby resolved, that Rule 1855 ["Plots"], Rule 1856
["Adjacency"], Rule 1860 ["Officers may not own plots"], Rule 1843
["Buying and Selling Plots"], Rule 1844 ["Winning by Ownership"], Rule
1845 ["Structures"], Rule 1846 ["Ergs"], Rule 1848 ["Types of
Structures"], Rule 1849 ["Maintenance of Structures"], Rule 1850
["Production of Structures"], Rule 1851 ["Standard Types of
Structures"], and Rule 1857 ["The Cartographor"] be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1677 ["Currency Awards for new
Players"] be amended to read:

      As soon as possible after the start of a Player's Grace Period,
      the Registrar shall pay out 5 Voting Tokens and 1 P-Note to that
      Player.

**END PROPOSAL

The following Proposal is to be titled "Slam the Door" and is to have
Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
NOTE: Text enclosed in right brackets has no legal significance and
      shall in no way affect the legality or efficacy of any part of
      this Proposal.

Be it hereby resolved, that Rule 1631 ["Membership of InterNomic"],
Rule 1633 ["InterNomic Proposals"], Rule 1748 ["Awards for Internomic
Proposals"], Rule 1632 ["InterNomic Voting Procedure"], Rule 1635
["Calling for InterNomic Judgement"] and Rule 1634 ["InterNomic
Judgement"] be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      The Ambassador is hereby directed to inform the InterNomic
      Moderator that Agora Nomic has elected, in accordance with
      its Rules and as permitted by the Rules of InterNomic, to
      withdraw from InterNomic.

      Within one week of doing so, the Ambassador shall propose that
      this Rule be repealed.


**END PROPOSAL

The following Proposal is to be titled "Every Man Is an Island" and is
to have Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
NOTE: Text enclosed in right brackets has no legal significance and
      shall in no way affect the legality or efficacy of any part of
      this Proposal.

Be it therefore resolved, that Rules 766, 716, 719, 721, 1752, 718,
1446, 1539, 1528, 1614, 1612, 1531, 1547, 1759, 1533, 1397, 1617,
1458, and 717 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 206 be amended, by replacing
"Players and Groups are Voting Entities" with "Players are Voting
Entities".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1637 be amended, by deleting the
paragraph which begins "A Will belonging to an Organization".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1727 be amended, by deleting the
paragraph which contains the phrase "the Notary may select".

Be it further resolved, that Rules 1601, 1637, 1738, and 1757 all be
amended, by replacing the word "Notary" with the word "Chancellor"
wherever it may appear.

[While there may be some utility in allowing bodies corporate, the
current Rules woefully fail to accomplish this in any useful sense.
Furthermore, most contests can be adequately carried forth under the
Law of Contracts (Rule 1742) without requiring the overhead of
statutory support.  SLCs should probably also go, but I'll cross that
bridge when I find it.]
