 Howdy, everyone.  Spring Break's over, and I have a good 221 Agora
 messages to catch up on.

 I hereby move from the Stasis Chamber to the Beer Hall.

 If this movement does not implicitly make me Off Hold, I go Off Hold.

 I hereby rebel.

Kolja has brought it to my attention that R1784 actually awards 3
Points only to those Players who vote on *more* than 3 Proposals
in a week. Examining the voting records, I find that neither Kolja,
Swann nor myself voted on 4 or more Proposals within any 7 day
period. (I came closest, missing out by about 25 minutes.) Therefore,
none of the above Score Changes are actually mandated by the Rules.
If Scorekeepor Swann has already changed his records to reflect them,
he should now change them back. If not, he should ignore them.
