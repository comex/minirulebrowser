This message contains one or more Proposals.  Each Proposal begins
immediately after a line marked "**START PROPOSAL" and ends
immediately before the first following line marked "**END PROPOSAL".

The following Proposal is to be titled "Unlimited Voting" and is to
have Adoption Index 2.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 206 be amended to read:

      (a) A Voting Entity is an Entity which is generally authorized
          by the Rules to cast a vote or votes on a Proposal.  Other
          Rules may withdraw this authorization from a Voting Entity
          in specific circumstances without that Entity thereby
          ceasing to be a Voting Entity.  Only those Entities
          designated by the Rules to be Voting Entities are Voting
          Entities.

      (b) No Entity is permitted to vote on a Proposal unless it is a
          Voting Entity.

      (c) Players and Groups are Voting Entities. 

      (d) Unless otherwise specified, each Voting Entity may cast an
          unlimited number of Votes on a Proposal.   

Be it further resolved, that Rules 1660 and 1765 be repealed.


**END PROPOSAL

I cannot mail to discussion.  I wonder it this will go through.  I
apologize for sending this to business.  I also don't want too be too
quiet.

If you don't want to know the answer, don't ask the question.
