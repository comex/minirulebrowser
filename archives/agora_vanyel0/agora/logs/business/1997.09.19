It might also be 1 Payment Order for 3 Indulgences.  I'm not entirely
settled on that.  I do believe that the present language should be
amended, since it is creating so much trouble. :)

Proto:  Muddy The Waters

[I *could* be straightforward and call it "Clarify Blots", but...]

Amend Rule 1435 by replacing this paragraph:

      A Payment Order for 1 Indulgence, the payee of which is the
      Bank, is called a Blot.  When a Rule states that a Player is to
      gain some number of Blots, a Payment Order shall be executed
      with that Player as the payor, the Bank as the payee, and for a
      number of Indulgences equal to the number of Blots that Player
      is to receive.  This order is to be executed by whomever is
      required to report the change in Blots.

with this paragraph:

      A Payment Order for a number of Indulgences, the payee of which is
      the Bank, is called that number of Blots.  A statement that an entity
      gains some number of Blots is a Payment Order for that number of
      Indulgences from that entity to the Bank.

OK. I feel quite silly now. Thank you to everyone who has pointed this

Kolja suggested you just vote and nobody call you on the infraction.  I'm
for that.

But also, if you now begin the voting period, it'll end before it begins,
and this vote is between those two dates.

What, I got a new Indulgence already? Very well: 

I hereby Transfer an Indulgence to Vir.

I believe this should fulfil our recent trade agreement, although if it is
determined that all VTs have been destroyed and I didn't have the
necessary VTs to perform my previous VT Transfer to Vir, I will of course
attempt to make a new Transfer at a later time.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

Based on the reasonings in ChrisM's judgment for CFJ943, I hereby admit this
claim and do hereby vacate POI016.

I just noticed that the Subject: line of the CotC's message relating to 
the judgement of CFJ 943 incorrectly states the judgement -- the subject 
line reads

OFF: CFJ 943 Judgement: TRUE

while the judgement enclosed in the message is a FALSE judgement.

This is just to clarify and prevent confusion.

This Judgement submitted on the behalf of Elde, as eir Executor.

In CFJ 933, Elde Judges the Statement to be TRUE.

The reasons for thinking so are briefly outlined as follows :

* before 3533 passed, the Mint was a Nomic Entity
* the Mint was defined by Rule 1470
* 3533 amended 1470 so that it no longer defined the Mint
* by Rule 1586, the Mint ceased to exist
* at that time, the Mintor of VTs was still the Mint (1696)
* by Rule 1579, all VTs were therefore destroyed at that instant
* (thereafter, 1696 was amended to make the Bank the VT Mintor)

Rule 1579 stated :

      If the designated Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist or ceases
      to possess Mint Authority, all units of that Currency are
      destroyed and the Currency ceases to exist.

It has been suggested that Rule 1579 was at that time in conflict 
with Rule 1471, which stated

      The Mintor of a Currency may, at any time, destroy those units
      of that Currency which it currently possesses in its Treasury,
      so long as this destruction is permitted by the Rules.  Units of
      Currency may not be otherwise destroyed except as specifically
      authorized by the Rules.

separate support for this position being sought from this provision 
in Rule 1467 :

      Neither Currencies nor units of Currency shall be created or
      destroyed except as specified by the Rules.

It must be noted that Rule 1579's provisions both authorize, and
specify the manner of, the destruction of units of any Currency
falling under its purview; therefore, no conflict exists, precisely
because of both 1467's and 1471's conflict-avoiding provisions.
