The VP for Registrar will end sometime today; in less than 6 hours, I 
would say. (I'll post a more precise time in a few moments, if I can 
afford a break this morning.) BTW, in case I haven't already done so, 
I vote for Michael in the Registrar Election.

Ooops, my mistake. I'd figured the close of the VP as two weeks
after the start of the NP, which is quite wrong - the VP started
when I posted the list of Candidates; which means that it will end
on Friday, March 6, 13:00 GMT+1.

Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Inciting to Riot}

Any Player who is Rebellious continually for a period in excess of one
month shall be guilty of the Infraction of Inciting To Riot. This
Infraction shall be reported by the Registrar, and upon the report of
the Infraction the Player becomes Abiding.

The penalty for this Infraction shall be one Blot, plus one additional
Blot for each instance the player switched from Abiding to Rebellious
since the last Rebellion.


{Comment: Thinking thoughts about rebellion, it strikes me that the one
          reason that rebellion is so easy is because Players can be 
          rebellious effectively permanently.  (Players such as myself 
          :)  This rule forces a little cost into the Rebellion picture 
          without changing the mechanism.  (sort of a converse of the 
          Miscreant proposal.)}

Swann, please pay 1 P-Note to the Bank for the purpose of making "The Great

its voting period ends before the coming Revolt.

Well spoken, Morendil! This is the Agoran spirit at its best. I am
pretty certain I can speak for the members of the Threat when I say
that we absolutely welcome the formation of a Group prepared to play
as hard - and as fair - as we do.

H. Herald Crito!

I hereby transfer a Kudo

FROM Kolja, for grumbling about fair play,
TO   Morendil, for expressing what is best in the Agoran spirit.

Proposal: Risky Rebellion 

Amend Rule 1664 to read:

      Any Player is either Abiding or Rebellious. A new Player is always
      Abiding when e becomes a player. A Player whose Location is the 
      Beer Hall can switch from Abiding to Rebellious or from Rebellious
      to Abiding by sending a message to the Public Forum saying e does
      change so. The Registrar shall maintain a list of all Players that
      are Rebellious. This list is known as the Red Pages, and is part
      of the Registrar's Report.

      A Player may Call for a Revolt at any time, by sending to the 
      Public Forum saying e does so. A Call for Revolt is only effective
      if the following conditions are met:

         i) The player posting the Call is Rebellious,
        ii) No other effective Call for Revolt has been made that week,
       iii) A successful Revolt has not occured for a month or more.

      As soon as possible after an effective Call for Revolt has been
      posted, the Registrar must determine whether the Revolt succeeds,
      as outlined below, and post the result to the Public Forum.

      The result of a Revolt is determined as follows: The Registrar
      selects a random integer from 1 to the number of Players at the
      time of the Call for Revolt. If this number is less than or equal
      to the number of Rebellious Players at the time of the Call for 
      Revolt, then the Revolt succeeds, otherwise it fails.

      If a Revolt succeeds, then the following events occur (in order):

         - The Registrar shall vacate all Blots of each Rebellious 
           Player.
         - The Registrar shall pay out 2 VTs to each Rebellious Player.

         - A Speaker Transition occurs
         - All Players that hold one or more Offices in the normal
           fashion cease to hold those in a normal fashion and hold them
           temporarily instead.
         - All Rebellious Players become Abiding again

      If a Revolt does not succeed, then:

         - All Rebellious Players gain 2 Blots.
         - The Player who Called for Revolt gains 2 (additional) Blots

      The Registrar shall execute all Payment Orders required by this 
      rule.
      
      The Registrar is authorised to vacate any payment orders this
      rule requires em to vacate.

Create a Rule with the title "Robespierre":

      There shall exist a Patent Title of "Robespierre".
      When a Revolt succeeds, the Player who Called for the Revolt is
      awarded this Title, and any previous holder of the Title loses it.
