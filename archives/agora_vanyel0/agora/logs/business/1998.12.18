H. Assessor, 

I hereby cast votes as follows. Of course, those after 'Kolja A.' are
my own votes, and the votes after 'Order' I cast on behalf of the
Order of the Evil Eye, as High Priest, Vizier and Executor of this
worthy siblinghood (or whatever the Spivak version of brotherhood is ;)

I'm still undecided about my votes on P3818 - Morendil and Oerjan
voted against this, and I don't quite know why. Is there a scam in the
making? To me P3818 looks like a straightforward fix, that needs and
deserves the 3:1 majority it needs to pass.

Thanks, 

Kolja A.
