H. Promotor, please note the follwing proposal I'd like to make: 

Amend 1715 by replacing the sentence       

      A Player may declare that e is PRESENT on a Proposal, Election
      or Referendum, by sending a message to the Assessor to that
      effect.

with

      A Player may declare that e is PRESENT on a Proposal, Election
      or Referendum, by sending a message to that effect to the Vote 
      Collector of this Proposal, Election or Referendum.

At the same time, correct the spelling error in the rule's title so it
reads "Announcing One's Presence" (not "Annoucing").

>======================================================================

In the matter of CFJ 1061, I judge that the Statement is TRUE. The
Caller's arguments are persuasive.

I believe it was Crito who suggested that the Statement might be
trivially false because a Player newly installed into Office might
violate ASAP by posting eir Report out of order, even though within
the week. But Morendil's rebuttal is incisive: in that case, the
Player would be guilty of Tardiness, but not of Failure to Report.

Injunctions:

Firstly, I hereby grant Morendil's request for an Injunction to Annotate,
and enjoin the Rulekeepor to Annotate R1585 with the Statement and the list
of Relevant Rules.

Secondly, and as required by R1504, I hereby issue an Injunction enjoining
the Clerk of the Courts to vacate the Payment Orders, executed by then-
Registrar Zefram in his 'Salary Report 1997-W43', penalizing Kolja and
Steve for Failure to Report.
