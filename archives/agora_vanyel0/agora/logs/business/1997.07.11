H. Promotor Andre!

I hereby submit the following Proposal, paying the necessary Petition
Fee to do so.

####
Proposal
Restore Game Balance II

[Comment: with the Judgement of CFJ 928, and the reversal of the
transfers which occurred subsequent to the passage of P3482, we
have returned to the absurdly VT-abundant environment (there are
now over 7700 VTs in circulation) which that Proposal sought,
unsuccessfully as it turned out, to correct. This time, I'm taking
no chances; I'm making RGBII enact a self-repealing Rule.]

Be it therefore resolved that a Rule, entitled "Restore Game Balance II",
be created with the following text:

      Upon the creation of this Rule, the following changes to Nomic
      Properties take place:

      (1) the number of Voting Tokens in the Bank is increased by
          the total number of Voting Tokens possessed by all Contests,
          and the number of Voting Tokens held by each Contest is
          adjusted to zero;

      (2) the number of Voting Tokens possessed by each Player who
          possesses more than 200 Voting Tokens is adjusted to be
          200, and to each decrease in the Voting Tokens possessed
          by these Players caused by this adjustment there corresponds 
          an equivalent increase in the number of Voting Tokens held
          by the Bank;

      (3) the number of Voting Tokens possessed by each Entity other
          than the Bank is adjusted to be one tenth of its previous
          value, and to each such decrease caused by this adjustment
          there corresponds an equivalent increase in the number of
          Voting Tokens held by the Bank.

      (4) if the number of Voting Tokens possessed by any Player 
          after the adjustment performed above in (3) is less than 5,
          then the number of Voting Tokens possessed by that Player is
          adjusted to be 5, and to each such increase caused by this
          adjustment there corresponds an equivalent decrease in
          the number of Voting Tokens held by the Bank.

      All adjustments required by this Rule are detected and reported by
      the Assessor. This Rule shall repeal itself when the adjustments
      required by it are reported by the Assessor in the Public Forum.

I think this may have been lost while Steve was having problems with
his mail, so I'll try again:

This is a claim of error concerning the pink pages in the latest
Registrar's Report: I think I should be listed there instead of
Elde.

> Proposal 3534 (Blob)
> Perpetual Offices

AGAINST. I'd object anyway whenever this was suggested, so I might
as well object now.

> Proposal 3535 (Blob)
> Make Rebellion more interesting

AGAINST. We have enough randomness built in the Game as it is, it's high time 
we decided to pursue more 'calculated' strategies instead.

> Proposal 3536 (Steve)
> A Public Voting Experiment

FOR. Or maybe I mean AGAINST. Oh, no, FOR. Oh what the hell, maybe I should 
just wait a while and mail my Vote to the Assessor privately. :)

> Proposal 3537 (Steve)
> Disinterested Amendments can be Attributed

Present. If someone offers an interesting bribe though...

> Proposal 3538 (Steve)
> Restore Game Balance II

AGAINST. Now _this_ definitely calls for a bribe, which anyway would be a step 
toward restoring Game Balance, right ?

> Proposal 3539 (Andre)
> Let (most) Attitudes be known

Present. Somewhat too vague IMHO.

No helpful recap for the benefit of the Assessor on account of my being too 
drunk to attempt such a sober thing. Will resume this policy later though. :)

Hmmm. No vote for now, due to the weirdness that needs to be fixed, but I
do like the idea.

>   3536 Steve		1 A Public Voting Experiment

Well, it obviously doesn't affect *me* much. :) FOR.

>   3537 Steve		1 Disinterested Amendments can be Attributed

Present.

>   3538 Steve		1 Restore Game Balance II

Present. Of course, this will pass.

>   3539 Andre		1 Let (most) Attitudes be known

AGAINST. It says "Neutral" where it should say "Friendly," and anyway I
prefer to leave this more to discretion.

To recap:
