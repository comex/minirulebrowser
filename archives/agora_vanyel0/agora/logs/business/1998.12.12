>   3813 Crito          1 Simplify Currency Handling

I cast 2 votes AGAINST Proposal 3813 (I never figured out why it was
necessary for the Chancellor to be the actual Mintor and not just executor
of the Mintor).

>   3814 Gen Chaos      1 Currencies

I cast 2 votes AGAINST Proposal 3814 (The first typo occurs in line 4, and
I am not certain that any currencies will continue to exist after this
comes into effect.  Did somebody say "grandfather clause" ?)

>   3815 Morendil       1 Ruleset Lite

I cast 2 votes AGAINST Proposal 3815 (It misses the point: the presence of
these harmless rules is not the problem with Agora.)
