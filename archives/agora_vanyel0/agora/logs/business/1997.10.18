Rule 1558, in part:

      * No Player may be Nominated who would not be permitted to hold
        the Office which the Election is seeking to fill.

1) This may or may not apply to Players who become ineligible to hold Office
   after becoming Nominated, depending on whether you equate "be" with
   "become" or "remain".

2) Makes no difference in Morendil's case - Rule 790 trumps Rule 1006, so
   Morendil is permitted to become S-E.

3) However, Rule 1555 causes em to be immediately removed from Office.

At least that's how I see it.  I will CFJ on these matters if there is
significant disagreement, just to get it settled.  I also submit this


Proto-Proposal:  Fix Elections.  Again.

Amend Rule 1558 by replacing this text:

      * No Player may be Nominated who would not be permitted to hold
        the Office which the Election is seeking to fill.

with this text:

      * If a Candidate would not be permitted to fill the Office which the
        Election is seeking to fill, then any attempt to cast a Vote for
        that Candidate is without effect.

Amend Rule 1006 by adding to the following paragraph:

      At any time, an Office is held by exactly one Player; if no
      other Rule directly or indirectly specifies which Player holds
      an Office, it shall be held by the Speaker.

this text:

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would cause an Office
      not to be held by exactly one Player.

Decision of pro-Speaker Murphy:  OVERTURN/reverse

I agree with all of the various arguments already expressed in the Public
Forum by the decisions of my fellow Justices, and do not see any pressing
reason to reiterate said arguments.

Hmm, was there a TIA violation there or not?  Here are my thoughts:

1) "I hereby allege that..." is unavoidably true.
2) "I am Abandoning" was definitely false, and I certainly said that.
3) I *think* I didn't even consider the existence of the statement "I am
   Abandoning", or its truth value, until after realizing that that was
   actually the statement I had made - but I'm not sure.
4) Had I considered the truth value of "I am Abandoning" at the time I
   made that statement, I would have believed it to be false.

Benefit of the doubt, anyone?
