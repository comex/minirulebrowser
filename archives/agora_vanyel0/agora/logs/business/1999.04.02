As I said in n-d, I think voter apathy is a problem, and I'd like to
make it a little riskier. So I suggest adding a condition to the Debt
Voting rule which allows the removal of Voting Privileges from anyone
who doesn't pay their penalties for Failing to Vote. This will also
have the effect of reducing Quorum slightly, both of which are, imho
worthy risks for anyone who is not willing to participate it such 
a central aspect of the game.

Proto-proposal: Use it or Lose it, v2

Amend Rule 1824 ("Debt Voting") to read:

      An entity for which, at the beginning of a given Nomic week,
      there is at least one Overdue Payment Order naming it as Payor
      which was executed originally for the purpose of paying for
      Voting upon Proposals, or as a penalty for Failing to Vote,
      commits the Infraction of Debt Voting.

      This Infraction shall be reported by the Recordkeepor for Voting
      Tokens, and shall bear the penalty of the denial of Voting
      Privileges for a period of two weeks.
