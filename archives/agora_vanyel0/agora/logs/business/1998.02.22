I hereby vote for myself, myself, and myself, respectively.


Why should you all vote for me, you ask? Why? *WHY?* It's quite simple:

I shall use my wizardly powers to *force* other Nomics to capitulate,
bending their wills and powers to mine, laughing heartily as their very
Rules turn against them and they grovel before my feet! Ha!

Oh, yeah, and I'll do a good job of keeping track of people's scores, too.

I just fixed this to include the Speaker Transition fix in Steve's
current proposal. If there are no other recommended changes, then I
will propose this soon.

Blob

----

Proto-Proposal: Risky Rebellion

Amend Rule 1664 to read:

      Any Player is either Abiding or Rebellious. A new Player is always
      Abiding when e becomes a player. A Player whose Location is the 
      Beer Hall can switch from Abiding to Rebellious or from Rebellious
      to Abiding by sending a message to the Public Forum saying e does
      change so. The Registrar shall maintain a list of all Players that
      are Rebellious. This list is known as the Red Pages, and is part
      of the Registrar's Report.

      A Player may Call for a Revolt at any time, by sending to the 
      Public Forum saying e does so. A Call for Revolt is only effective
      if the following conditions are met:

         i) The player posting the Call is Rebellious,
        ii) No other effective Call for Revolt has been made that week,
       iii) A successful Revolt has not occured for a month or more.

      As soon as possible after an effective Call for Revolt has been
      posted, the Registrar must determine whether the Revolt succeeds,
      as outlined below, and post the result to the Public Forum.

      The result of a Revolt is determined as follows: The Registrar
      selects a random integer from 1 to the number of Players at the
      time of the Call for Revolt. If this number is less than or equal
      to the number of Rebellious Players at the time of the Call for 
      Revolt, then the Revolt succeeds, otherwise it fails.

      If a Revolt succeeds, then the following events occur (in order):

         - The Registrar shall vacate all Blots of each Rebellious 
           Player.
         - The Registrar shall pay out 2 VTs to each Rebellious Player.

         - A Speaker Transition occurs
         - All Players that hold one or more Offices in the normal
           fashion cease to hold those in a normal fashion and hold them
           temporarily instead.
         - All Rebellious Players become Abiding again

      If a Revolt does not succeed, then:

         - All Rebellious Players gain 2 Blots.
         - The Player who Called for Revolt gains 2 (additional) Blots

      The Registrar shall execute any payment orders required by this
      rule.

Create a Rule with the title "Robespierre":

      There shall exist a Patent Title of "Robespierre".
      When a Revolt succeeds, the Player who Called for the Revolt is
      awarded this Title, and any previous holder of the Title loses it.

[v1.0 The aim is to make Rebellion a bit more risky, but also to set 
      penalties so that if a Revolt does take place, you'd rather be
      on the winning side.]
[v1.1 fixed some language, added reporting requirement]
[v2.0 added Blot penalties & Patent Title]
[v2.1 toned down some of the rewards & penalties]
[v2.2 Added some language modifications suggested by Murphy]
[v2.3 Removed "At the time this Rule is created..." sentence]
[v2.4 Fiddled with the penalties again.]
[v3.0 Removed the penalty for Abiding Players, and changed the reward to 3 EVs]
[v3.1 Removed vague language about determining the result of the Revolt]
[v3.2 Changed to reflect new Agoraspace & Indulgences rules.]
[v4.0 Changed to reflect Pragmatic currencies & prevent multiple Revolts]
[v4.1 Revised to use "Speaker Transition"]

Changes in v3.1:

* The bug used to avoid "Real VT scarcity now" should be closed.

Changes in v3.2:

* Blueprints are dropped.  If you want Structures to be able to generate
    your Currency, Propose a Rule stating how it works.
* Creation and destruction of Structures is Plato-Pragmatized, sort of.
* Player's Maintenance Fee = total of Structure Fees, plus 1 Erg per Type
    of Structure e owns.  Player must pay eir Fee within a week or lose
    all eir Structures.  If e can't afford it, e must get rid of some
    Structures before the Fee becomes due.

Proto-Proposal:  Plots (v3.2)


[Part One:  Replace Locations with Plots]

Rename Rule 1706 ("Locations") to "Plots" and amend it to read:

      There is a class of entities called Plots.  All Plots are initially owned
      by the Bank.

      Each Plot has a unique name.  A Plot's owner may change its name Without
      Objection.

      Plots are not Locations; no Location shall become a Plot due to the
      adoption of the Proposal which enacted this Rule.  One second after this
      Rule is created, it shall amend itself by removing this paragraph.

Create a new Rule entitled "Buying and Selling Plots" with this text:

      The Market Value of a Plot is 5 VTs, unless another Rule states
      otherwise.

      A Player may become the owner of a Bank-owned Plot by transferring the
      Market Value of that Plot to the Bank for the sole purpose of buying
      that Plot.

      A Plot's owner may transfer ownership of it to any other consenting
      entity, by informing the Cartographor that e wishes to do so.  For the
      purposes of this Rule, the Bank is always deemed to consent to such
      wishes.  Furthermore, as soon as possible after a Plot is transferred to
      the Bank in this way, the Cartographor shall pay out half the Plot's
      Market Value to the transferring entity.

Repeal Rule 1707 ("Movement").

Amend Rule 1708 ("Adjacency") to read:

      Each Plot has a Longitude and Latitude, each of which is an integer.  Two
      Plots are Adjacent if and only if one of the following applies:

        * They have the same Longitude, and their Latitudes differ by one.
        * They have the same Latitude, and their Longitudes differ by one.

Repeal Rule 1709 ("Distance").

[Rule 1710 ("The Cartographor") will be amended later.]


For each combination of Latitude (X) from 0 to 9 and Longitude (Y) from 0 to 9,
a Plot named "Area XY" (substituting the Latitude for "X" and the Longitude for
"Y") is created.


Create a Rule entitled "Winning by Ownership" with this text:

      If at least one-third of all Plots are not owned by the Bank, and all
      Plots not owned by the Bank are owned by a single entity, then that
      entity's Executor satisfies a Win Condition known as a Win by Monopoly.

      Upon the correct report of such a Win, all Plots become Owned by the
      Bank.


[Part Two:  Define Structures and Ergs]

Create a Rule entitled "Structures" with this text:

      There exists a class of entities known as Structures.  All Structures are
      initially owned by the Bank, unless otherwise specified.  No entity other
      than the Bank may own more than five Structures.

      A Structure is created or destroyed whenever a Player reports its
      creation or destruction as required by the Rules.

      Each Structure is either assigned to a specific Plot, or unassigned.  All
      Structures are initially unassigned.

      An unassigned Structure's owner may assign it to a Plot by informing the
      Cartographor that e does so, unless another Structure is already assigned
      to that Plot.

      An assigned Structure's owner may make it unassigned by informing the
      Cartographor that e does so.  The owner of a Plot with a Structure
      assigned to it may also make that Structure unassigned by informing the
      Cartographor that e does so.

Create a Rule entitled "Ergs" with this text:

      Ergs are a Currency.  Their MUQ is 1.  Their Recordkeepor is the
      Cartographor.  Their Mintor is the Bank.

100 Structures and 10,000 Ergs are created in the Bank's possession.

Amend Rule 1677 ("Currency Awards for New Players") to read:

      As soon as possible after the start of a Player's Grace Period, the
      Registrar shall pay out 5 Voting Tokens, 5 P-Notes, and 15 Ergs to that
      Player.  In addition, the Registrar shall report to the Cartographor that
      3 Structures are created in that Player's possession.

Amend Rule 1701 ("Proposal Notes") by removing this paragraph:

      Whenever there exists a Player who has never before possessed
      any P-Notes, the Promotor shall pay out 5 P-Notes to that Player.

Create a Rule with this text:

      Upon the creation of this Rule:
        * All Voting Tokens and P-Notes are destroyed.
        * All obligations to transfer Currency are cancelled.
        * For each Player, 5 VTs, 5 P-Notes, 15 Ergs, and 3 Structures are
            created in that Player's possession.

      One second after this Rule is created, it repeals itself.


[Part Three:  Make Structures useful]

Create a Rule entitled "Types of Structures" with this text:

      All Structures have a Type.  All Structures are initially Idle, and any
      unassigned Structures become Idle if they are not already Idle.

      An assigned Structure's owner may change its Type by informing the
      Cartographor and paying the new Type's price to the Bank.

      As soon as possible after a Structure's Type changes, the Cartographor
      shall pay out half the old Type's price (rounded down) to the Structure's
      owner.

Create a rule titled "Maintenance of Structures" with this text:

      At the beginning of the month, each Player's Maintenance Fee for that
      month becomes due.  One week after the beginning of the month, each
      Player's Maintenance Fee for that month becomes delinquent, unless it has
      already been paid.

      A Player's Maintenance Fee equals the total of the Maintenance Fees of
      all the Structures e owns, plus 1 Erg per Type of Structure e owns.  This
      value is fixed at the time the Fee becomes due.

      A Player's Maintenance Fee for a given month is paid when e successfully
      pays that amount to the Bank for the sole purpose of paying eir
      Maintenance Fee for that month.

      As soon as possible after a Player's Maintenance Fee becomes due, the
      Cartographor shall inform that Player of the amount of the Fee.

      As soon as possible after a Player's Maintenance Fee becomes delinquent,
      the Cartographor shall report that all Structures owned by that Player
      are destroyed.

Create a rule titled "Production of Structures" reading:

      As soon as possible after the end of the Nomic Week, the Cartographor
      shall pay out each Structure's Production to its owner, excluding
      Structures whose Type changed during that Week.

      Churches have no Production.  However, each Church is considered to be
      two players for the purpose of randomly allocating Indulgences, and any
      Indulgence that would otherwise be given to a Church is instead given to
      its owner.

      Only one Vatican may exist at any time, and it is always owned by the
      Bank.  Its Production is a number of Indulgences equal to the number of
      Blots issued and not vacated during the previous Nomic Week.

A Structure is assigned to Area 42 and becomes the Vatican.

Create a Rule entitled "Standard Types of Structures" with this text:

      Only Types of Structure defined by the Rules exist.

      The following Types of Structure exist, with the specified prices,
      Productions, and Maintenance Fees, unless otherwise specified:

        Type         Price      Production   Maintenance Fee
        ----------------------------------------------------
        Idle         none       none         none
        Farm         4 Ergs     1 VT         1 Erg
        House        4 Ergs     1 P-Note     1 Erg
        Mine         4 Ergs     1 Erg        1 Erg
        Church       4 Ergs     none         1 Erg
        Vatican      none       special      3 Ergs

Create a new Rule titled "Interaction of Structures" and this text:

      Two Structures are Adjacent if and only if they are assigned to Adjacent
      Plots.

      A Farm's Production is increased by 0.5 VT for each House or Church to
      which it is Adjacent, and decreased by 0.5 VT for each Mine to which it
      is Adjacent.

      A House's Production is increased by 1 P-Note for every 2 Farms or Mines
      to which it is Adjacent.


[Part Four:  Amend the Rule defining the Cartographor and eir duties]

Amend Rule 1710 ("The Cartographor") to read:

      There is an Office of Cartographor. The Cartographor recieves a
      salary equal to 2 times the Basic Officer Salary.

      At least once each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall post a
      Report to the Public Forum containing the following information:

        * the name, ownership, and Adjacency of all Plots
        * the ownership, assignment (if any) and Type of all Structures
        * the ownership of all Ergs
        * all changes in ownership of Plots since the last Report
        * all changes in ownership, assignment, or Type of all Structures since
            the last Report
        * all Transfer Orders and Payment Orders specifying Ergs since the last
            Report


[Part Five:  Clean up other references to Locations]

Amend Rule 869 ("Registered Players") by removing the following paragraph:

      When a Player registers, eir Location is the Welcoming Center.

Amend Rule 1016 ("Putting Oneself On Hold") by replacing "Moves to the Stasis
Chamber" with "says so in the Public Forum", and by replacing "Moves from the
Stasis Chamber" with "says so in the Public Forum".

Amend Rule 1664 ("Rebellion") by removing the text "whose Location is the Beer
Hall".

Amend Rule 1367 ("Degrees") by adding this paragraph:

      "Granting a Degree" and "awarding a Degree" are synonymous.  A Player who
      has been awarded a Degree possesses that Degree.

Repeal Rule 1711 ("Accepting Degrees").

H. Promotor Crito,

I hereby submit the following Proposal, paying 1 P-Note to the Bank
to raise its priority to 1.

####
Proposal
Delegation, Revolt & Perpetuity

[Comment: this fixes two bugs: you can't escape facing election
after a Revolt by delegating, and you don't lose the status of holding
your Office in Perpetuity if you delegate. I regard this patch as
temporary; the Officer Rules need an overhaul along lines sketched
by Oerjan. This will do for now.]

Be it hereby resolved that R1645 (Temporary Delegation of Office)
be amended by replacing the text in it which currently reads:

      At the end of the Period of Delegation, the Delegated Player
      ceases to hold the Delegated Office, and the Delegating Player
      resumes holding the Office in the normal fashion, unless the
      Term of Service for that Office has expired.  In that case, the
      Delegated Player continues to hold the Office temporarily,
      although the Office ceases to be a delegated Office.

with text which reads:

      At the end of the Period of Delegation, the Delegated Player
      ceases to hold the Delegated Office, and the Delegating Player
      resumes holding the Office in the normal fashion, unless the
      Term of Service for that Office has expired, or a Revolt
      occurred during the Period of Delegation. If the Term of
      Service expired, the Delegated Player continues to hold the
      Office temporarily, although the Office ceases to be a
      delegated Office. If a Revolt occurred during the Period of
      Delegation, and at the end of the Period of Delegation no
      other Player is holding the Office in the normal fashion, the
      Delegating Player resumes holding the Office, but temporarily, 

Be it further resolved that R1758 (Holding an Office in Perpetuity)
be amended to read:

      If a certain Office is held in the normal fashion by a Player,
      then the Registrar may declare Without Objection that that
      Player holds the Office in perpetuity.

      The Term of Service of an Office held in perpetuity shall never
      expire, and a Player holding an Office in perpetuity continues
      to hold the Office in perpetuity while e holds the Office. If a
      Player holding an Office in perpetuity delegates the Office to
      another Player, then, if e resumes holding the Office in the
      normal fashion at the end of the Period of Delegation, e also
      resumes holding the Office in perpetuity.

      This Rule takes precedence over other rules defining the expiry
      of an Office's Term of Service.
