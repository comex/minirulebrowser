H. Promotor Blob,

I hereby (re)submit the following Proposal, hoping that this time
it will make Quorum.

####
Proposal 
Get Rid of 4 Offices

[Comment: this Proposal will delete the Offices of Scorekeepor, 
Archivist, Wizard, and Commander-in-Chief. Plots and the Cartographor
remain untouched.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rules 1775 (Points and Scoring), 1776 (the

Be it further resolved that R1370 (How To Get A Degree) be amended by
replacing in it the text which currently reads:

      manner.

with text which reads: 

      The Rulekeepor shall retain a copy of each Thesis posted in this
      manner.

Hi all,

I'll be away from home, and probably eMail access, next week. Does
anyone want to play ambassador for one week?

Your job will essentially be to publish the report, and check whether
something appears on the IN-list that must be distributed in the
report. This will be either the results on INP378-81 (if Uri gets
around topublishing them by then), or new proposals.

I'll mail you the template for the report, so it will be hardly any
work. 

Please send your application to me. 

Thanks a lot, Kolja A.
