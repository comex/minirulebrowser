Well, I for one am willing to accept that this was a sufficiently 
random variable (with some provisos, as below). So I accept that the
revolt failed, this time.

I am not willing, however, to admit defeat so:

I Call for Revolt again!

Of course, this call is only effective if the previous Revolt did indeed
fail.

Sunday's closing value was 7640.25. I very much doubt that today's 
closing value will be a uniform random variable, given this knowledge.
I think it would be wise of Michael to choose a different method of
determination this time.
