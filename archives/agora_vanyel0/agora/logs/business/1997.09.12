Proto:  Plots (v1.0)


[Part One:  Rename Locations to Plots.  Discard Entities having
 Locations and Moving.]

Amend Rule 1706 to read:

     There is a class of Entities called Plots.  Each Plot has a
     unique name.  The Agoraverse is the set of all Locations.

     A Plot is Rule-Named if it is referred to by name in the Rules.

     The Cartographor is authorized to change any non-Rule-Named
     Plot's name Without Objection.

     There is a Plot named "the Origin".

Repeal Rule 1707.

Amend Rule 1708 to read:

     Two Plots may be Adjacent to each other.  No Plot is Adjacent to itself.

Repeal Rule 1709.

[Rule 1710 will be amended later.]


[Part Two:  Create land ownership.]

Create a Rule titled "Landowners" with this text:

     Each non-Rule-Named Plot has an Executor, known as its Owner;
     each such Plot's initial Owner is the Mint.

     Rule-Named Plots never have an Executor or Owner.

Create a Rule titled "Buying Land" with this text:

     If a Plot's Owner agrees to sell the Plot to another entity,
     then the second entity becomes the Plot's Owner.

     For the purpose of this Rule, the Mint agrees to sell a Plot
     when the prospective new Owner pays at least 4 VTs to it for
     the sole purpose of buying that Plot.

Create a Rule entitled "Winning by Ownership" with this text:

     Owning at least half of all Plots is a Winning Condition
     known as a Win by Ownership.


[Part Three:  Create something to do with the Plots you own]

Create a Rule entitled "Mules" with this text:

     Mules are a Currency.  Their MUQ is 1.  Their Recordkeepor is
     is the Cartographor.

     A Mule's Owner may transfer it to any Plot e owns by executing a
     Transfer Order of one Mule from emself to that Plot.  However,
     a given Plot may possess at most one Mule.

     A Mule's Owner may remove it from its Plot by notifying
     the Cartographor that e does so, at which time the Mule is
     transferred to the Owner.

Create a Rule entitled "Energy" with this text:

     Energy is a currency.  Its MUQ is 1.  Its Recordkeepor is the
     Cartographor.

The Mint has 10000 units of Energy.

Amend Rule 1677 to read:

     Upon the start of a Player's Grace Period, the Registrar shall
     pay out to that Player an award of 5 Voting Tokens, 5 P-Notes,
     20 Mules, and 20 units of Energy.

Amend Rule 1701 by removing this paragraph:

     Whenever there exists a Player who has never before possessed
     any P-Notes, the Promotor shall pay out 5 P-Notes to that Player.

Each current Player gains 20 Mules and 20 units of Energy.

Create a Rule entitled "Structures" with this text:

     Any Mule within a Plot may become a Structure (unless it is one
     already) when its Owner pays the price of that type of Structure
     to the Mint.  Unless otherwise specified, the price is 4 units
     of Energy.

     A type of Structure exists only if the Rules explicitly define it.

     The following types of Structures exist:

       * Farms
       * Houses
       * Mines
       * Churches

     A Structure ceases to be a Structure when its Owner says so, or
     when it is no longer within a Plot.  At that time, its Owner
     receives half the price of that type of Structure, rounded down.

Create a rule titled "Upkeep on Structures" with this text:

     Each Owner of one or more Structures is required to pay
     monthly upkeep.  Unless otherwise specified, this is equal to
     2 units of Energy for the first Structure of each type, plus
     1 unit of Energy for each additional Structure.

     If an Owner does not pay the upkeep on all of eir Structures
     within one week of the beginning of the month, all of eir
     Structures collapse and are destroyed.

Create a rule titled "Production from Structures" reading:

     At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall
     pay out each Structure's Production to its Owner.  Unless
     otherwise specified, each Structure's Production is as follows:

       * Farms - 5 VT
       * Houses - 1 P-Note
       * Mines - 1 unit of Energy

     Churches have no Production.  However, each Church is considered
     to be two players for the purposes of randomly allocating
     Indulgences, and any Indulgences which would be given to a Church
     are instead given to its Owner.

Create a new Rule titled "Proximity of Plots" and this text:

     A Farm's Production is increased by 0.3 VT for each House or
     Church to which it is Adjacent, and decreased by 1 VT for each
     Mine to which it is Adjacent.

     A House's Production is increased by 1 P-Note for every 2 Farms
     to which it is Adjacent.

     A Mine's Production is increased by 1 unit of Energy for every
     two Houses to which it is Adjacent, and decreased by 1 unit of
     Energy for every two Farms to which it is Adjacent.


[Part Four:  Amend the Rule defining the Cartographor and eir duties]

Amend Rule 1710 to read:

     There is an Office of Cartographor. The Cartographor recieves a 
     salary equal to 2 times the Basic Officer Salary.

     At least once each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall post a 
     Report to the Public Forum containing the following information:

       * all Plots, and which Plots are Adjacent to which others
       * the Ownership of all Plots
       * the ownership and location of all Mules
       * the ownership of all units of Energy
       * what type of Structure (if any) each Mule is

Andre,

It dawned on me that when you transferred a P-Note
on 9/7/97 (TOP007), it was possible for you to
distinguish between one P-Note and the others. 
That is, one of your P-Notes itself owned a P-Note
and was therefore distinguishable from the others.

It seems to me, since you have control over
transfers out of your possession, you also have
control over which P-Note is actually transferred,
if you can distinguish one from another.  In this
case you could.  Since you did not tell me which
one at the time, we've got two ways to go.

1.  Consider the owning P-Note to have been
transferred with 1/3 probability (you had 3
P-Notes at the time).

2.  Consider that you just neglected to tell me
which one, so that you can tell me now and I can
update my records properly.

Option 1 is probably more accurate assuming you,
like the rest of us, forgot about this little
situation at the time of the transfer.  But, what
the heck, it's just your word for it, so let me
know which way to go (unless other Players have
some thoughts about what should be done here).

-- Promotor Crito

P.S.  Once this P-Note makes it's way to the Bank,
it's my impression that the Chancellor will have
control over when and whether it gets transferred
out.
