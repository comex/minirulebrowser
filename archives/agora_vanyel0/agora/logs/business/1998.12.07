Now here's a pretty pickle. Proposals 3810-12 were distributed last 
Monday. When does their voting period end? Is it seven days after it
began, or is it ten? If it's seven, then it is already over. If it is
ten, then there is still time for me to vote:

I vote FOR 3810, AGAINST 3811, and ABTAIN on 3812. So there.

Noting that at present a Proposal can be in the Queue for several
weeks, it seems like a good idea to use this time to increase the
quality of Proposals by allowing them to be improved while in the
Queue. To allow this,  I hereby submit the following Proposal, the
text of the Proposal being the part between the lines of dashes. The
Title of the Proposal shall be 'Amendment Applications'

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Let a Rule be created, with the Title 'Amendment Applications', and
the following text:

  There exists a type of Application called an Amendment Application. 
  Such an Application is Executed by submitting it to the Promotor.
  For an Amendment Application to be effective:

  * it must state that it is an Amendment Application;

  * it must clearly identify exactly one Proposal to which it applies;

  * the Proposal to which it applies must be in the Proposal Queue

  * it must contain a text, clearly identified as such, that is to be
  the new text of the Proposal;

  * it must contain the signature of the Executor of the Proposer of
  the Proposal

  * it must contain the signature of each Player that increased the
  Priority of the Proposal

  When an Amendment Application takes effect, the text of the Proposal
  is changed to the text specified in the Amendment Application.

Furthermore, let Rule 1036 be changed by changing the phrase
  "This publication shall include the number, title, priority, and
   time of proposal, for each proposal in the Queue."
by
  "This publication shall include the number, Proposer, title, 
   Priority, and time of proposal, as well as any Players other than
   the Proposer who increasted the Priority of the Proposal, for each
   proposal in the Queue."

This message contains one or more Proposals.  Each Proposal begins
immediately after a line marked "**START PROPOSAL" and ends
immediately before the first following line marked "**END PROPOSAL".

The following Proposal is to be titled "Make the Proposal Queue More
Competitive  " and is to have Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it therefore resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) The Proposal Tariff is a number of P-Notes (which must be a
          multiple of the MUQ for P-Notes), greater than 0 and not
          more than 2.

      (b) The value of the Proposal Tariff, upon the adoption of the
          Proposal which created this Rule, is 1.

      (c) The Promotor may change the value of the Proposal Tariff by
          announcing its new value in the Public Forum, provided that
          the new value is within the range allowed by subdivision (a)
          of this Rule.

      (d) Whenever a new value is announced according to subdivision
          (c) of this Rule, the new value takes effect at the
          beginning of the next Nomic Week, unless the announcement is
          made within three days of the end of the current Nomic Week,
          in which case the new value takes effect at the beginning of
          the Nomic Week following the next Nomic Week.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1771 be amended to read:

      A Player may increase or decrease the Priority of a Proposal in
      the Queue by announcing to the Public Forum that e does so, and
      paying a number of P-Notes to the Bank. For each multiple of the
      Proposal Tariff e pays to the Bank, the Priority of the Proposal
      is increased or decreased by one, as specified by the Player
      making the payment, provided that this transfer is not executed
      for any other purpose.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1701 be amended, by replacing "is 1"
with "is 0.01".

**END PROPOSAL

I tend to think it's ten.  If so, I hereby vote FOR 3811.
