H. Promotor Blob,

I hereby submit the following Proposal.

If I have a P-Note, I pay 1 P-Note to the Bank to increase its Priority
to 1.

####
Proposal
A Duty to Vote

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "A Duty to Vote", be enacted
with the following text:

      An Active Player with effective control of more than three Voting
      Tokens at the time a batch of Proposals is distributed, who is not
      denied Voting Privileges at that time, who is Active at the end of
      the Voting Period of the Proposal in the batch whose Voting Period
      finishes latest, and who fails to cast a vote on any Proposal in
      the batch, commits the Infraction of Failing to Vote, to be
      detected and reported by the Assessor. The penalty for commission
      of this Infraction is 1 Blot and 1 VT.

      Effective control of an asset (eg. a unit of Currency) is the
      ability to dispose of that asset as one wishes. The Assessor is
      empowered to make determinations as to whether a Player has
      effective control over a particular asset at a particular time.
      Such determinations are defeasible and may be overturned by the
      Courts.

      Three months after this Rule is created, this Rule shall repeal
      itself.

Be it further resolved that Rule 1016 (Putting Oneself on Hold) be
amended by replacing in it the text which currently reads:

      E may not do so until at least 96 hours after e last went On Hold.

with text which reads:

      E may not do so until at least a week after e last went On Hold.

####
