I certainly don't deserve this Kudo transfer, as I was not the Player
who discovered the bug(s) in the Impeachment Rules. General Chaos
deserves the credit for spotting the 'Adoption Ratio' bug, and elJefe
for discovering the Delegation bug. I can't even say I've found
Antimatter's behaviour especially aggravating. Therefore

H. Herald Crito,

I hereby transfer a Kudo

FROM myself, because I don't deserve the Kudo Antimatter transferred
     to me for the reasons given above,

TO   Swann, because he has nothing to be ashamed of. We the voters
     are collectively responsible for the Proposals we vote to adopt.

H. Promotor Blob,

I hereby submit the following Proposal, paying 2 P-notes to the Bank
to raise its Priority to 2.

####
Proposal
Indelible Proposal voting

[Comment: indelible voting has a number of advantages: it's legislatively
simpler (no need to worry about retracted or changed votes), it
encourages VT spending since Players can't retract votes in excess
of those needed to achieve the result they desire, and it provides a
negotiation-friendly environment, since Players can publically keep
promises and/or signal that they are not available to be negotiated
with by voting.]

Be it therefore resolved that R683 have its Title changed to
"Voting on Proposals" and that it be amended to read:

      A Voting Entity votes upon a Proposal when, during the Voting
      Period of that Proposal, e informs the Assessor of the vote or
      votes e is casting upon that Proposal, provided that e is
      authorized to cast those votes on that Proposal. Once cast, a
      vote cannot be changed or cancelled by the Voting Entity which
      cast it, although it may be cancelled as other Rules require.

      A vote upon a Proposal must be one of FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN
      (or an obvious synonym of one of these).  Something which is not
      one of these is not a vote upon a Proposal.

      A vote cast by a Voting Entity which does not have an Executor
      is cast at a time and in a manner specified in other Rules.

      This Rule in no way authorizes any entity to cast votes upon
      Proposals.

Be it further resolved that Rule 1442 have its Title changed to
"The Cost of Voting" and that it be amended to read:

      As soon as possible after the end of the Voting Period of a
      given Proposal, the Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity a
      number of Voting Tokens equal to the votes cast on that
      Proposal by that entity.

[Comment: together these amendments also eliminate some overlap between
the current versions of these Rules. They do take in to account the
effect of Omnibus Reform, assuming that passes.

>From the recent Assessor's Report :

> U  3710 Swann            1 The Great Officer's Ve... PASSES 19-10-0-0

I claim that this is in error, as it does not take into account Votes 
cast by OOEE, Threat, and Sherlock.

This will not affect the results on 3710, but it might have been 
significant; in any case, this matter deserves to be addressed by the 
Courts, and therefore I hereby Call for Judgement on the following 
Statement :

----------

When a Proposal is declared to be a Senate Proposal, and Votes
were previously cast on such a Proposal by Entities who were not
Senators, such Votes are nevertheless still legal Votes and should be
taken into account for the purpose of determining Voting results.

----------

R&A :

Rule 683 defines what "legal Votes" are. It does not contain a
provision allowing other Rules to alter the legality of a Vote after
the fact. Rule 995 defines the Voting results on a Proposal as a
tally of all Votes that have been "legally cast".

Rule 1717 claims that a Vote cast by a non-Senator at the time a
Proposal is declared to be a Senate Proposal is 'cancelled', which
can only be interpreted as a claim to override the definition of a
legal Vote as specified by Rule 683. Thus, Rule 1717 is in conflict
with Rule 683 with respect to such Votes.

However, it does not explicitly claim precedence; therefore, Rule
683 wins that conflict, and Votes cast by non-Senators before a
declaration of a Senate Proposal are still legal. 

Note however that Votes cast by non-Senators after such a
declaration are not valid, as it is the first sentence of Rule 206
that is relevant in that case.

PROPOSALS
---------

3/3  The following Proposals are distributed:
=A0=A0     3698 [Kolja A.]=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0Buying points
=A0=A0  =A0=A0 3704 [General Chaos]=A0The Omnibus Reform Act of 1998

=A0=A0   =A0 3710 [Swann]=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0The Great Officer's =
Veto Scam Proposal
=A0=A0  =A0=A0 3713 [Blob]=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0Risky Rebellion

     Proposal 3710 would close two loopholes (after using them to give
       Wins to Swann and the Threat):  First, Rule 1766 (Officer's
       Veto) lets Officers cast two extra Votes on Proposals affecting
       their duties; Proposal 3710 would amend this Rule to allow only
       two extra AGAINST Votes.  Second, an instrument may create (or
       empower the creation of) another instrument with higher Power
       than its own.

     Speaker Steve has noted that this Scam was the true motivation
       for the Threat to gain the Speakership:  without it, the
       Speaker could deny the relevant Officers their two extra votes
       each, by Calling for Elections (and thus causing the Officers
       not to hold Office in the normal fashion).

3/4  Steve protoes "Indelible Proposal voting".

3/5  Speaker Steve declares Proposal 3710 a Senate Proposal.

CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1086 [Morendil]
         2/23  Assigned to Harlequin
         3/5   Harlequin commits the Infraction of Judicial Inactivity
                 by going On Hold while a Judge.  However, e remains
                 Judge until 3/9, unless e is recused before then.
         "The Proposal submitted by Crito with title Cantus Cygneus,
          claimed to be a Silly Proposal, is not, in fact, a Silly
          Proposal."

CFJ 1087 [Antimatter]
         3/7  Called
         "The last sentence of Rule 1766 prevents the remainder of
          that rule from granting additional votes."


PROBATE
-------


OFFICES
-------

Recent Elections:
  Accountor - Crito leads General Chaos unanimously; voting ends 3/14
  Registrar - Michael is Elected

3/3  Sherlock calls for the Impeachment of ten Offices (plus the
       Speakership, which isn't an Office).  This begins a Referendum
       for each Office.

3/6  Morendil makes an excellent analysis of what will happen if
       Speaker-Elect Blob is impeached:
         * Rule 1647 says the Speaker can't be S-E.  Rule 1555 says e
           can, and takes precedence.
     Assuming that a Revolt occurs shortly thereafter:
         * Speaker and S-E Steve would have to perform Rule 402's
           ceremonial handshake with emself, after which S-E Steve
           would "become" Speaker.
         * Before that could happen, S-E would come to hold Office
           temporarily.  Thus, when e "became" Speaker, e would be
           Tainted.  This would trigger an Election for S-E, with the
           winner becoming (non-Tainted) Speaker.
     However, this turns out to be incorrect, due to the recently =
adopted
       Proposal 3703.  Actually, S-E Steve would immediately "become"
       Speaker, before the Revolt caused all Offices to become held
       temporarily; and Promotor Crito would become temporary S-E.


INTERNOMIC
----------

2/24  INP 360 is adopted.

      Agora will vote for INP 363.

3/2   INPs 361 and 362 are rejected.


OTHER
-----

3/4  elJefe becomes Shogun.

3/5  Antimatter registers.

3/6  Kolja A. and Swann become Abiding.

3/9  Kolja A. submits a Bachelor of Nomic Thesis.


ERRATA
------

Rule 1486 (Procedure to Impeach an Officer) does define an effect of
the Impeachment of an Officer, namely that the Officer is removed from
that Office (which then falls temporarily to the Speaker).

Changes from previous version:

* Churches are back to their original behavior.
* Deleted "Interaction of Structures".  (May be Proposed separately later.)
* At Michael's suggestion, only active Structures exist.
* Deleted ability to change a Structure's Type; you simply destroy it
    and create another in its place.
* Deleted requirement to pay a Structure's Maintenance Fee at any time
    other than beginning of month; each Structure's price is 4 Ergs
    anyway, you only get 2 Ergs back for destruction, so it's cheaper
    to pay Maintenance Fees (a little over 1 Erg per Structure) than
    destroy and re-create your Structures.

Proto-Proposal:  Plots (v3.5)


[Part One:  Replace Locations with Plots]

Rename Rule 1706 ("Locations") to "Plots" and amend it to read:

      There is a class of entities called Plots.  All Plots are initially owned
      by the Bank.

      Each Plot has a unique name.  A Plot's owner may change its name Without
      Objection.

      Plots are not Locations; no Location shall become a Plot due to the
      adoption of the Proposal which enacted this Rule.  One second after this
      Rule is created, it shall amend itself by removing this paragraph.

Create a new Rule entitled "Buying and Selling Plots" with this text:

      The Market Value of a Plot is 5 VTs, unless another Rule states
      otherwise.

      A Player may become the owner of a Bank-owned Plot by transferring the
      Market Value of that Plot to the Bank for the sole purpose of buying
      that Plot.

      A Plot's owner may transfer ownership of it to any other consenting
      entity, by informing the Cartographor that e wishes to do so.  For the
      purposes of this Rule, the Bank is always deemed to consent to such
      wishes.  Furthermore, as soon as possible after a Plot is transferred to
      the Bank in this way, the Cartographor shall pay out half the Plot's
      Market Value to the transferring entity.

Repeal Rule 1707 ("Movement").

Amend Rule 1708 ("Adjacency") to read:

      Each Plot has a Longitude and Latitude, each of which is an integer.  Two
      Plots are Adjacent if and only if one of the following applies:

        * They have the same Longitude, and their Latitudes differ by one.
        * They have the same Latitude, and their Longitudes differ by one.

Repeal Rule 1709 ("Distance").

[Rule 1710 ("The Cartographor") will be amended later.]


For each combination of Latitude (X) from 0 to 9 and Longitude (Y) from 0 to 9,
a Plot named "Area XY" (substituting the Latitude for "X" and the Longitude for
"Y") is created.


Create a Rule entitled "Winning by Ownership" with this text:

      If at least one-third of all Plots are not owned by the Bank, and all
      Plots not owned by the Bank are owned by a single entity, then that
      entity's Executor satisfies a Win Condition known as a Win by Monopoly.

      Upon the correct report of such a Win, all Plots become Owned by the
      Bank.


[Part Two:  Define Structures and Ergs]

Create a Rule entitled "Structures" with this text:

      There exists a class of entities known as Structures.  Each Structure is
      assigned to a Plot and owned by that Plot's owner.  No entity may
      own more than five Structures.

Create a Rule entitled "Ergs" with this text:

      Ergs are a Currency.  Their MUQ is 1.  Their Recordkeepor is the
      Cartographor.  Their Mintor is the Bank.

Amend Rule 1677 ("Currency Awards for New Players") to read:

      As soon as possible after the start of a Player's Grace Period, the
      Registrar shall pay out 5 Voting Tokens, 1 P-Note, and 50 Ergs to that
      Player.

Amend Rule 1701 ("Proposal Notes") by removing this paragraph:

      Whenever there exists a Player who has never before possessed
      any P-Notes, the Promotor shall pay out 5 P-Notes to that Player.

Create a Rule with this text:

      Upon the creation of this Rule:
        * All Voting Tokens and P-Notes are destroyed.
        * All obligations to transfer Currency are cancelled.
        * For each Player, 5 VTs, 1 P-Note, and 50 Ergs are created in
            that Player's possession.

      One second after this Rule is created, it repeals itself.


[Part Three:  Make Structures useful]

Create a Rule entitled "Types of Structures" with this text:

      All Structures have a Type.  Only Types of Structure defined by
      the Rules exist.

      A Player may create a Structure by informing the Cartographor.  E
      must specify the Structure's Type, and to which Plot the Structure
      is assigned.  As soon as possible after this happens, the Cartographor
      shall bill that Player the price of that Type of Structure.

      A Player may destroy a Structure by informing the Cartographor.  E
      must specify to which Plot the Structure is assigned.  As soon as
      possible after this happens, the Cartographor shall pay out to that
      Player half the price of that Type of Structure.

Create a rule titled "Maintenance of Structures" with this text:

      A Player's Maintenance Fee equals the total of the Maintenance Fees of
      all the Structures e owns, plus 1 Erg per Type of Structure e owns, at
      the end of the Nomic Week.

      As soon as possible after the end of the Nomic Week, the Cartographor
      shall bill each Player's Maintenance Fee to that Player.

Create a rule titled "Production of Structures" reading:

      As soon as possible after the end of the Nomic Week, the Cartographor
      shall pay out each Structure's Production to its owner, excluding
      Structures whose Type changed during that Week, and excluding Players
      with a Maintenance Fee that is neither satisfied, disputed, nor vacated.

Create a Rule entitled "Standard Types of Structures" with this text:

      The following Types of Structure exist, with the specified prices,
      Productions, and Maintenance Fees, unless otherwise specified:

        Type       Price      Production     Maintenance Fee
        ----------------------------------------------------
        Farm       4 Ergs     1 VT           1 Erg
        House      4 Ergs     1 P-Note       1 Erg
        Mine       4 Ergs     3 Ergs         1 Erg
        Church     4 Ergs     special        1 Erg

      Churches have no Production.  However, when an Indulgence is to be
      given to a random Player, each Church is deemed to be two Players,
      and any Indulgence that would otherwise be given to a Church is
      instead given to its owner.


[Part Four:  Amend the Rule defining the Cartographor and eir duties]

Amend Rule 1710 ("The Cartographor") to read:

      There is an Office of Cartographor. The Cartographor recieves a
      salary equal to 2 times the Basic Officer Salary.

      At least once each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall post a
      Report to the Public Forum containing the following information:

        * the name, ownership, and Adjacency of all Plots
        * the ownership, assignment (if any) and Type of all Structures
        * the ownership of all Ergs
        * all changes in ownership of Plots since the last Report
        * all changes in ownership, assignment, or Type of all Structures since
            the last Report
        * all Transfer Orders and Payment Orders specifying Ergs since the last
            Report


[Part Five:  Clean up other references to Locations]

Amend Rule 869 ("Registered Players") by removing the following paragraph:

      When a Player registers, eir Location is the Welcoming Center.

Amend Rule 1016 ("Putting Oneself On Hold") by replacing "Moves to the Stasis
Chamber" with "says so in the Public Forum", and by replacing "Moves from the
Stasis Chamber" with "says so in the Public Forum".

Amend Rule 1664 ("Rebellion") by removing the text "whose Location is the Beer
Hall".

Amend Rule 1367 ("Degrees") by adding this paragraph:

      "Granting a Degree" and "awarding a Degree" are synonymous.  A Player who
      has been awarded a Degree possesses that Degree.

Repeal Rule 1711 ("Accepting Degrees").

I'm am going to have to delegate my Office of Promotor for a while, as
I will be unable to perform my duties. I have tendonitis in my right wrist,
from too much typing, and I am going to have to cut down on my computer
usage for a while.

If e is willing, I hereby delegate the Office of Promotor to Crito.
