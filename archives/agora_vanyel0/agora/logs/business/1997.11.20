Welcome back Blob!

Unfortunately for Blob, Rule 1437 requires me to
issue the following order:

Blob is hereby commanded to pay 14 Indulgences to
the Bank.

As of this message, Blob's Fugitive Blots are

This looks wrong to me.  This is a COE.

Also, I think you may be using hard tabs or something, because the numbers
don't line up in the proper columns in the messages I receive, makes it hard to
decipher sometimes.

Er, you're right.  That, obviously, should be 1, -1, 0.

Sorry, Emacs sometimes does that.  I usually try to remember to
untabify the document before sending it, but I obviously forgot this
time.  I'll try harder to remember to do so next time.

FYI, this COE puts the Payment Order for
Indulgences, POI297, into dispute.

But it was late:

The assignment message had this header:

Or 7 days and 224 minutes later.

If the Rules gave me the option of accepting your Judgement (rather than
reassign to Calabresi, who will most likely default), I would have done so.

Regretfully, COE denied.

H. Promotor Crito,

I hereby submit the following Proposal, and pay the Petition Fee to do
so.

####
Proposal
Resignation and consent

[Comment: Swann's Judgement of CFJ 1069 exposes a flaw in Rule 880:
a Player other than the Speaker can come to hold an Office without
eir consent. I propose to fix this bug. In the process, I've made 
the Rule a lot more explicit about timing.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 880 be amended to read:

      An Officer is always permitted to resign from any Office e
      holds, provided e appoints another Player to succeed em. An
      Officer who resigns without appointing a successor is deemed
      to have appointed the Speaker to succeed em.

      The Speaker can be appointed to hold an Office temporarily
      without consenting, and may not refuse such an appointment.
      If the Speaker is appointed, e becomes the new holder of the
      Office at the time of the resignation.

      If the appointed Player is not the Speaker, e does not become
      the new holder of the Office unless e explicitly consents to
      the appointment in the Public Forum in the seven days immediately 
      before or after the resignation. If e does so consent, e
      becomes the new holder of the Office either at the time of the
      resignation, or at the time of eir consent, whichever is latest.  

      If the appointed Player does not consent, and seven days have
      passed since the resignation, and the resigning Officer is still
      holding the Office, the Speaker becomes the new holder of the
      Office.

      A change in the identity of the Speaker does not automatically
      cause the transfer of any Offices being held by the former
      Speaker to the new Speaker.

>======================================================================

In the matter of the Appeal of the Judgement of CFJ 1065, I overturn
Vlad's Judgement and find the Statement TRUE.

Judge Vlad erred in law in asserting that R790 does not require
that an Office be held by a Player in order that it be held in
the normal fashion. The language of R790 is very strong: the
construction used is 'if and only if', the language of necessity
and sufficiency. An Office is held in the normal fashion if and
only if the Officer holding that Office was elected to that Office.
Since R1006 defines an Officer as a Player, one is forced to
the conclusion that a non-Player holding an Office cannot be an
Officer. Since Morendil, a non-Player at the time this CFJ was
called, was holding the Office in virtue of the high precedence
of R790, I conclude that Morendil was not then an Officer.

I also reject the Michael's suggestion that R790 implicitly 
defers to R1006 and so avoids conflict with it, and affirm with
the Caller the conflict between these two Rules. This conflict
arises almost inevitably from the hole left in the Rules 
concerning Candidates for Election, and the Winners of Elections,
which does not prevent a non-Player from continuing as a Candidate
in and Winning an Election.
