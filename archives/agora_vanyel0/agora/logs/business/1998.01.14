Proto-Proposal: The Proposal Queue 1.1

Amend Rule 1036 ("Making And Distributing Proposals") to read:

      As soon as possible after the Promotor receives a new Proposal,
      e shall assign to it a Number as specified in other Rules.
      E shall then place this Proposal on the Proposal Queue.

      The Proposal Queue is a list of Proposals, sorted in order of
      descending Priority. Proposals of the same priority are
      listed in the order they were proposed.

      A Proposal's Priority is an integer value. All Proposals 
      initially have a Priority of zero. 

      The Promotor shall publish the Proposal Queue weekly.
      
Change the title of Rule 1036 to "Making Proposals"

Create a rule, with title "Distributing Proposals", with text:

      Each week, the Promotor shall distribute a batch of Proposals.

      If there are five or fewer Proposals in the Proposal Queue
      having a Priority greater than zero, then the batch shall
      consist of all such Proposals.

      If there are more than five such proposals, then the batch shall
      consit of the first five such Proposals, in the order given by
      the Queue. 

      Once a Proposal is distributed, it is removed from the Proposal
      Queue.

      Promotor shall distribute each proposal in the batch to the 
      Public Forum, accompanied by its Number and  the identity of its 
      Proposing Entity.

      The failure of the Promotor to distribute any of the above
      accompaniments with a Proposal does not deprive the distribution
      of the Proposal of any legal effect. 

      A Proposal is only considered to be legally distributed if it
      is explicitly marked as such. The Promotor is permitted to
      publish the text of undistributed Proposals without necessarily
      distributing them.

Create a rule, with title "Increasing Priority", with text:

      A Player may increase the Priority of a proposal by notifying
      the Promotor that e does so, and paying a number of P-Notes to
      the Bank. For each P-Note e pays to the Bank, the Priority of 
      the Proposal is increased by one, provided that this transfer
      is not executed for any other purpose.

Create a rule, with title, "Promotor's Privilege", with text:

      At most once a week, the Promotor may increase the Priority of
      a single Proposal in the Proposal Queue by one, so long as
      e is not the Proposer of the Proposal.
 
Create a rule, with title "Decreasing Priority", with text:

      At the beginning of each week, the Priority of each Proposal 
      in the Proposal Queue shall decrease by 0.25. If the Priority
      of any Proposal falls below zero, then it shall be set to 
      zero.

Create a rule, with title "Discarding Proposals from the Queue", with
text:

      If, at any time, there is a Proposal in the Proposal Queue 
      which has zero Priority and has been in the Queue for more
      than four weeks, then the Promotor may, at eir discretion,
      remove this Proposal from the Queue, and discard it.

      Also, the Proposer of a Proposal in the Queue may remove
      that Proposal from the Queue, by notifying the Promotor 
      that e does so.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

[Comment: Remove the old Petition Fee system]

Repeal Rule 1702 ("Petition Fee for Proposals")

Amend Rule 1623 ("Disinterested Proposals") to read:

      A Proposal is Disinterested if the text of the message wherein
      it is submitted explicitly states that it is a Disinterested
      Proposal. If a Proposal is not Disinterested, it is Interested.

Amend Rule 1723 ("Sanity") by replacing the text:

      A Proposal is Sane if the text of the message wherein it is
      submitted explicitly states that it is a Sane Proposal, and it
      is not Disinterested.

      The Petition Fee for a Sane Proposal is increased by three.

with:

      A Proposal is Sane if all the following conditions are met:

         i) the text of the message wherein it is submitted 
            explicitly states that it is a Sane Proposal,

        ii) The Proposal is Interested,

       iii) The Proposer has paid 2 P-Notes to the Bank, expressly
            for this purpose (and not for any other). In order for
            this payment to have effect, it must be made before
            the Proposal is distributed.

Amend Rule 1724 ("Emergency Proposals") by replacing the text:

      A Proposal is Emergency if the text of the message wherein it is
      submitted explicitly states that it is an Emergency Proposal,
      and it is not Disinterested.

      The Petition Fee for an Emergency Proposal is increased by two.

with:

      A Proposal is Emergency if all the following conditions are met:

         i) the text of the message wherein it is submitted 
            explicitly states that it is an Emergency Proposal,

        ii) The Proposal is Interested,

       iii) The Proposer has paid 1 P-Note to the Bank, expressly
            for this purpose (and not for any other). In order for
            this payment to have effect, it must be made before
            the Proposal is distributed.

Amend Rule 833 ("Awards & Penalties for Proposals") to read:

      At the end of the Voting Period for a Proposal, if a Proposal
      has received more FOR Votes than AGAINST Votes, the Assessor
      shall pay out 2 VTs to the Proposer.

      The Assessor shall execute all Payment Orders required by this
      Rule no later than the time e announces the Voting Results of
      the Proposal in question.

[1.0: Basic idea of the Queue.]
[1.1: Remove Petition Fees. 
      Add means for removing proposals from the Queue. 
      Added requirement for the Queue to be published.
      Require distribution to be explicitly marked (so that the
      Promotor can publish the contents of the Queue without actually
      "distributing" them.)]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Title: The Rulekeepor should have an Official Report

Amend Rule 1051 "The Office of the Rulekeepor" by replacing the second
paragraph with the following text:

      The Rulekeepor shall maintain a complete list of all Rules.  The
      Short Logical Ruleset constitutes the Rulekeepor's Official
      Report. In addition, the Rulekeepor shall post the Full Logical
      Ruleset to the Public Forum at least once each month.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

When and if this passes I will propose to make Chuck Rulekeepor in
Perpetuity. 

Michael.

As is only fair, I hereby retract all Votes on 3669, and invite other 
Players who have Voted AGAINST to do so as well, so as not to 
penalize Kolja for a selfless act.

I hereby pledge, and certify that I do so under the provisions of
Rule 1742, with any other willing Player as additional parties to
that agreement, that I will not attempt to change my Vote on
Proposal 3669, and I further pledge, naming Kolja, if willing, as the 
other party to that agreement, to reimburse Kolja as soon as I am 
able for any expenses incurred as a direct result of Proposing 3669.

Proto-Proposal

Indenture

Amend Rule 1714 to read :

   An Overdue Payment Order that is a number of Blots is that
   number of Overdue Blots.  A Lawless Player is a Player who has more
   than 30 Overdue Blots.

   Whenever a Player is Lawless and is eir own Executor, the Justiciar,
   or the Speaker if the Lawless Player holds the Office of Justiciar,
   shall conduct an Open Auction to Indenture that Player, as defined in
   other Rules.

   At the end of the Auction, the Herald shall vacate all Blots of the
   Lawless Player and bill that Player for 5 Indulgences.

Enact a Rule, titled "Auction to Indenture", reading :

   Whenever the Rules call for an Auction to Indenture a Player, all
   Active Players, with the exception of the Player whose Indenture is
   being auctioned, shall be eligible. The Bank shall be the Seller.

   The Winner of the Auction shall become the Executor of the 
   Indentured Player for a period of one month.

---

[Makes Lawlessness more fun, brings back echoes of the great Zombie
Scam, introduces Auctions - a potentially useful mechanism in and of
themselves - what more could you possibly want... ;) ]

[v1.1 changes - clarified rule for topping previous bids, prohibited
custom Currencies, only the Winner pays.] 

[v1.2 changes - now dependent on Auctions, protoed separately.]

One More Probate Fix

 Amend Rule 1601, replacing text which reads

   No entity may be destroyed while it possesses Units of Currency
   or while it is named as the Payee or Payor of any Payment
   Orders; any attempt to destroy an entity while it is in this
   condition shall be deferred until this condition no longer
   holds.

with text reading

   No entity may be destroyed while it possesses Units of Currency
   or while it is named as the Payee or Payor of any Payment
   Orders; any attempt to destroy an entity while it is in this
   condition shall be deferred until this condition no longer
   holds, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding. An entity which
   would otherwise be destroyed but whose destruction is being 
   deferred due to the foregoing provisions is called 'terminal'.

[Restores the meaning of 'terminal'; adds a precedence clause for 
safety.]

Hm. I find that I must Object to my own plan for the disposition of 
the estate of the Voodoo Lounge, on the grounds that it implements 
those provisions of the Probate Code that are dependent on the entity 
being terminal.

However, closer examination of the Ruleset does not reveal any Rule 
which specifies which entities are "terminal"; the word is used only 
twice in Rule 1739, and nowhere else.

I therefore announce my intention to, Without Objection, implement 
the following revised plan for disposing of the estate of the Voodoo 
Lounge, which shall consist of doing nothing about it.

Proto-Proposal
---
Currency Market

 Enact a Rule, titled "Agoran Monetary Standard", reading :

   At any time, exactly one Currency shall be designated as Agora's 
   Reference Currency. The Reference Currency may be designated by 
   the Rules, or any other means specified in the Rules.

   If the Rules fail to directly or indirectly specify a Reference 
   Currency, Voting Tokens shall be designated as the Reference 
   Currency.

   The Chancellor shall keep track of which Currency is the Reference 
   Currency, and post this information whenever e posts a list of 
   existing Currencies.

 Enact a Rule, titled "Exchange Rates", reading :

   Each Currency shall have associated with it an Exchange Rate, 
   which shall consist of a multiple of the MUQ of that Currency and 
   a multiple of the MUQ of the Currency currently designated as the 
   Reference Currency.

   The Exchange Rate of the Reference Currency shall at all times be 
   one to one.

   If the Rules fail to directly or indirectly specify a Currency's 
   Exchange Rate, that Currency shall have an Exchange Rate of zero 
   to one. A Currency with an Exchange Rate other than zero to one is 
   called a Traded Currency.

   The Chancellor shall keep track of the Exchange Rates of all
   Currencies, and post this information whenever e posts a list of
   existing Currencies.

 Enact a Rule, titled "Exchange Offers", reading :

   An Exchange Offer is a statement posted to the Public Forum 
   whereby a Player agrees to transfer an amount of a Currency called 
   the Sold Quantity to any Player who agrees to transfer to em an 
   amount of a different Currency known as the Purchase Price.

   Both Sold Quantity and Purchase Price must be expressed in 
   multiples of the MUQ of their respectives Currencies; further, the 
   Sold Quantity shall not exceed the amount of the relevant Currency 
   owned by the Player making the Offer, nor shall the Purchase Price 
   exceed the largest amount of the relevant Currency owned by any 
   Player. No Exchange Offer shall be valid unless it meets these 
   criteria.

   A Player who posts an Exchange Offer is bound to honor that 
   agreement with the first Player who announces that e is willing
   to perform the Exchange, and no other Player, within one Week of 
   entering the agreement.

   Fair and appropriate compensation for the breach of an agreement 
   entered into as the result of taking up an Exchange Offer, by 
   either party, shall consist of the amounts named therein plus a 
   penalty of 10% for the party responsible for the breach.

 Enact a Rule, titled "Exchange Rate Computation", reading :

   The Chancellor shall have the authority to compute the Exchange 
   Rate of any Currency.

   This consists of averaging the Sold Quantities of the Currency being
   considered and Purchase Prices naming the Reference Currency in
   Exchange Offers that have been posted since the last time that
   Exchange Rate was computed. The result is the Temporary Exchange
   Rate for that Currency. If no such Exchange Offers have been posted
   since the last computation, the Temporary Exchange Rate shall be the
   same as the last computed Exchange Rate.

   The Reference Currency equivalents in Purchase Prices of any other
   Currencies, computed at the Temporary Exchange Rate, and the Sold
   Quantities of the Currency being considered in all Exchange Offers 
   posted since the last computation shall be averaged to derive the 
   new Exchange Rate for that Currency.

   The Chancellor shall compute a new Exchange Rate for all 
   Currencies no more frequently than once a Week and no less than 
   once a Month.

   Whenever the Reference Currency is changed, the Chancellor shall 
   compute new Exchange Rates for all Currencies, such that the 
   same amount of a Currency is equivalent to the same amount of the 
   new Reference Currency.
---

[This is an attempt, possibly feeble, at introducing the notion of
determining the market values of Currencies with respect to each
other, which would make custom Currencies much more interesting. Any
comments, suggestions or improvements welcomed, especially as do not
have the faintest notion how such things are done in the Real
World.]

Auctions

 Enact a Rule, titled "Auctions", reading :

   Whenever the Rules call for an Auction to be held, the Player
   responsible for holding the Auction, or Auctioneer, shall announce
   that fact to the Public Forum as soon as possible, together with the
   identity of the Seller. For a period of one Week after such an
   announcement is posted, all Players, with the exception of any
   Players made ineligible by other Rules, may post Bids to the Public
   Forum.

   As soon as possible after the Auction ends, the Auctioneer shall
   announce the identity of the Winner of the Auction, if any, and any
   effects of the Auction specified in the Rules shall take place at the
   time of this announcement.

 Enact a Rule, titled "Bidding", reading :

   Bidding in an Auction consists of a naming an amount or amounts of 
   any number of Currencies which are specifically determined by the 
   Rules or which are designated as Traded Currencies.

   At the end of the Auction's bidding period, the Auctioneer shall 
   rank all valid Bids received. Bids are ranked by determining the 
   total, expressed in the Reference Currency, of all amounts of 
   Currencies named therein, at the Exchange Rate which was current 
   when the Auction started.

   The Bidder who submitted the highest ranking Bid is entitled to 
   become the Winner of the Auction, and to do so must transfer all 
   Currencies named in that Bid to the Seller within three days. If 
   that Bidder fails to do so within three days, or before that time 
   informs the Auctioneer that e is withdrawing from the Auction, the 
   Bidder who submitted the next highest ranking Bid shall be so 
   entitled, with the same strictures. The Auction ends whenever a 
   Bidder has exercised eir right to become Winner, or all Bidders 
   have withdrawn or failed to exercise that right.

   If the Auction being held is designated by the Rules as an Open
   Auction, Bids, retractions and payments shall only be valid if sent
   to the Public Forum.

 Enact a Rule, titled "Auctioning Currencies", reading :

   Any Player is authorized, once in any Week, to call for an Auction 
   to sell some of eir property. The announcement of the Auction 
   shall list amounts of any number Currencies, known as the 
   Auctioned Property.

   That Player shall be the Auctioneer and Seller. The Winner of the
   Auction shall be authorized to submit Payment Orders naming emself
   as Payee and the Seller as Payor, for all amounts of Currencies 
   named as the Auctioned Property.

[For the moment, this is dependent on the Currency Market proto for
a total ordering of Bids; if that fails to be finalized promptly, I
will go back to the partial ordering I suggested previously, as well
as the more complex Bidding rules this involves.]

Well in that case...

I object to the plan for the termination of Calabresi's estate, on the
grounds that Probate sucks.

This Justice determines, in agreement with fellow Justice ElJefe's
argument, that the Injunction was legal and appropriate given the
situation, and should be sustained.

Proto-Proposal: The Proposal Queue 1.2

Amend Rule 1036 ("Making And Distributing Proposals") to read:

      As soon as possible after the Promotor receives a new Proposal,
      e shall assign to it a Number as specified in other Rules.
      E shall then place this Proposal on the Proposal Queue.

      The Proposal Queue is a list of Proposals, sorted in order of
      descending Priority. Proposals of the same priority are
      listed in the order they were proposed.

      A Proposal's Priority is an integer value. All Proposals 
      initially have a Priority of zero. 

      The Promotor shall publish the Proposal Queue weekly. This 
      publication shall include the number, title, priority and
      time of proposal, for each proposal in the Queue. The actual
      text of the Proposals in the Queue need not be published.
      
Change the title of Rule 1036 to "The Proposal Queue"

Create a rule, with title "Distributing Proposals", with text:

      Each week, the Promotor shall distribute a batch of Proposals.

      If there are five or fewer Proposals in the Proposal Queue
      having a Priority greater than zero, then the batch shall
      consist of all such Proposals.

      If there are more than five such proposals, then the batch shall
      consist of the first five such Proposals, in the order given by
      the Queue. 

      Once a Proposal is distributed, it is removed from the Proposal
      Queue.

      Promotor shall distribute each proposal in the batch to the 
      Public Forum, accompanied by its Number and  the identity of its 
      Proposing Entity.

      The failure of the Promotor to distribute any of the above
      accompaniments with a Proposal does not deprive the distribution
      of the Proposal of any legal effect. 

      A Proposal is only considered to be legally distributed if it
      is explicitly marked as such. The Promotor is permitted to
      publish the text of undistributed Proposals without necessarily
      distributing them.

Create a rule, with title "Increasing Priority", with text:

      An Entity may increase the Priority of a proposal by notifying
      the Promotor that e does so, and paying a number of P-Notes to
      the Bank. For each P-Note e pays to the Bank, the Priority of 
      the Proposal is increased by one, provided that this transfer
      is not executed for any other purpose.

Create a rule, with title, "Promotor's Privilege", with text:

      At most once a week, the Promotor may increase the Priority of
      a single Proposal in the Proposal Queue by one, so long as
      e is not the Proposer of the Proposal.
 
Create a rule, with title "Decreasing Priority", with text:

      Every month, as soon as possible after the beginning of the
      month, the Promotor shall decrement by one the priority of all 
      Proposals in the Proposal Queue which were proposed over a 
      month previously.

      If the Priority of any Proposal falls below zero, then it 
      shall be set to zero.

Create a rule, with title "Discarding Proposals from the Queue", with
text:

      If, at any time, there is a Proposal in the Proposal Queue 
      which has zero Priority and has been in the Queue for more
      than a month, then the Promotor may, at eir discretion, remove 
      this Proposal from the Queue, and discard it.

      Also, the Proposer of a Proposal in the Queue may remove that
      Proposal from the Queue, by notifying the Promotor that e 
      does so.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

[Comment: Remove the old Petition Fee system]

Repeal Rule 1702 ("Petition Fee for Proposals")

Amend Rule 1623 ("Disinterested Proposals") to read:

      A Proposal is Disinterested if the text of the message wherein
      it is submitted explicitly states that it is a Disinterested
      Proposal. If a Proposal is not Disinterested, it is Interested.

Amend Rule 1723 ("Sanity") by replacing the text:

      A Proposal is Sane if the text of the message wherein it is
      submitted explicitly states that it is a Sane Proposal, and it
      is not Disinterested.

      The Petition Fee for a Sane Proposal is increased by three.

with:

      A Proposal is Sane if all the following conditions are met:

         i) the text of the message wherein it is submitted 
            explicitly states that it is a Sane Proposal,

        ii) The Proposal is Interested,

       iii) The Proposer has paid 2 P-Notes to the Bank, expressly
            for this purpose (and not for any other). In order for
            this payment to have effect, it must be made before
            the Proposal is distributed.

Amend Rule 1724 ("Emergency Proposals") to read:

      A Proposal is Urgent if all the following conditions are met:

         i) the text of the message wherein it is submitted 
            explicitly states that it is an Urgent Proposal,

        ii) The Proposal is Interested,

       iii) The Proposer has paid 1 P-Note to the Bank, expressly
            for this purpose (and not for any other). In order for
            this payment to have effect, it must be made before
            the Proposal is distributed.

      The Voting Period of an Urgent Proposal is five Nomic Days.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would specify the
      Voting Period for Urgent Proposals.

Change the title of Rule 1724 to "Urgent Proposals".

Amend Rule 833 ("Awards & Penalties for Proposals") to read:

      At the end of the Voting Period for a Proposal, if a Proposal
      has received more FOR Votes than AGAINST Votes, the Assessor
      shall pay out 2 VTs to the Proposer.

      The Assessor shall execute all Payment Orders required by this
      Rule no later than the time e announces the Voting Results of
      the Proposal in question.

[1.0: Basic idea of the Queue.]
[1.1: Remove Petition Fees. 
      Add means for removing proposals from the Queue. 
      Added requirement for the Queue to be published.
      Require distribution to be explicitly marked (so that the
      Promotor can publish the contents of the Queue without actually
      "distributing" them.)]
[1.2  Changed "Player" to "Entity" in "Increasing Priority"
      Changed "Emergency Proposal" to "Urgent Proposal"
      Plato-Pragmatised "Decreasing Priority" a bit]
