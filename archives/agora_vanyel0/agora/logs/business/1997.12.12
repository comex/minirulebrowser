As far as I can tell, the following Votes were barred by the FM
restriction.

This is a very annoying stricture, and very nearly enough to make me
resign the Assessorship.

Presuming that I have correctly ascertained whose votes were barred:

* Proposal 3603 fails, rather than passing.
* Proposal 3611 still passes, but 2-1 instead of 3-1.
* Proposal 3613 still fails, but 5-6 instead of 5-7.
* Proposal 3617 still fails quorum, but 1-1 instead of 2-1.
* Proposal 3618 fails quorum, rather than passing.
* Proposal 3619 fails quorum, rather than passing.
* Proposal 3622 fails quorum, rather than passing.

I will issue a revised report shortly.

Indulgence Distribution Begins

Fasten your seatbelts, the ride is beginning.  I am about to issue PO's for 252
Indulgences to make up for the backlog of invalid weekly distributions.  The
total number is derived from the list of weekly distribution amounts that I
posted previously.  I checked my eligibility lists with those thoughtfully
provided by Scott and they are in agreement.  I note that the Rules require the
Indulgences to be distributed to *all* Players, including those On Hold.  To
save space, I have not included those lists again.  Please refer to Scott's
posting for details - the first distribution is for the week of Aug. 18.  Also,
the two weeks where there was a negative amount for distribution occurred prior
to Scott's clarifying amendment to the Rule.  If anyone thinks this makes a
difference, let em make a good argument and further adjustments can be made.

Vacation of the PO's for the 17 Indulgences distributed in error will follow.
