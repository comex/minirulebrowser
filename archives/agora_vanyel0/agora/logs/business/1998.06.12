H. Promotor Crito,

I hereby submit the following Proposal, paying 1 P-Note to increase
its Priority by one.

####
Proposal
P-Note supply

[Comment: since Rulekeepor Chuck informs us that P3744 did not succeed
in amending R833, and since that amendment in my opinion was a desirable
one, I'm proposing it again.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 833 (Reward for Getting a Proposal Passed)
be amended by replacing in the text which currently reads:

      As soon as possible after an Interested Proposal submitted by a
      Player is adopted, the Assessor shall pay out two Voting Tokens
      to that Player, with the proviso that no more than one such
      payment shall be made to any Player under the authority of this
      Rule for adopted Proposals distributed at the same time.

with text which reads:

      As soon as possible after the beginning of the Nomic Week,
      the Assessor shall pay out two Proposal Notes to each Player
      who submitted an Interested Proposal which was adopted during
      the previous Week.

                         THE HISTORICAL AGORAN
                        a journal of nomic past
Volume 1, Issue 1----------------------------------------June 12,1998

Inaugural Editorial:

I hereby introduce this forum to help us recognize an undervalued
aspect of Agora, a resource of ours that is often only mentioned in 
passing, but a resource that is responsible for the depth of respect 
we all have for this particular game, even if we are sometimes only 
subliminally aware of it.

It is our rich and varied history.

Agora is close to being half a decade old.  Long enough that some of 
the earliest moments of the game may now only exist in the memories 
of elder Players.  I've come to ponder this amidst the recent calls 
for the elimination of the Archivist. I admit there may be some merit 
to that position in purely mechanical terms, the Office being an too-
often unused post in a pointedly forward-looking nomic, and the 
Office itself serves little "function" as far as the rules go.

Despite all this, I myself think there is a place for remembrance, a
place for preserving our past.  It is with those thoughts I begin 
this endeavor— a monthly record of events gone by, a retelling of our 
past.  I have acquired the old archives from ex-Player and ex-
Archivist Vanyel, and despite the occasional hole in the record, I 
intend to begun a retelling of where we have been, what have we 
done...

With this, I invite the contributions of my fellow Agorans, new and
not-so-new to contribute their remembrances.  Especially those whose 
memory extends backward, past the time of my first humble 
chronicle....

          The Normal and the Pink: The Injunctions of CFJ 727

We begin, perhaps typically, with an indeterminate Gamestate.  In the
12/1 Scorekeepor's Report, Scorekeepor Troublemaker at Large [aka TaL], 
writes;

------------------------------------------------------------------------
    "-This is the score report for the gameline we're in now. 
     Michael's Injunction is suspended by the Appeal of CFJ 727.
     In this situation the Nov. 22 report is valid and we start from 
     there.

     -In this case the game ends on Nov 28, with a winner and a reset to
     zero. (I assume Blob is deregistered.)

     -Now Oerjan's and N.E.'s transfers are allowed, but H w/o M's 
     transfers are not.

     -Confused? Me too. But I think I have it correct now."
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Which seems to be as apt a place to begin a chronicle of Agora as any. 
The indeterminacy stems from CFJ 727 whose statement alleges, "The Pink 
Bimbo [aka Kelly -ed.] violated Rule 993/0 when she proposed Proposal 
1330. Proposing this Proposal was an illegal Move."  Which was ruled by 
Judge Michael as TRUE. What Judge Michael also did was order an 
Injunction rolling back all proposals, and point changes, since the 
illegal 1330.  A period of some five weeks.  This is but one of a number 
of CFJs that result from the core issue, proposals made illegally 
because of the probably ill-conceived Rule 993/0 which read, in part:

      Proposals may be made which do not contain Rule Changes.  All
      proposals, except those which have one of the following
      declarations:
          (Creates a Rule)
          (Amends a Rule)
          (Repeals a Rule)
          (Transmutes a Rule)
          (Mutates a Rule)
      are Non-Rule-Change Proposals (or NRC Proposals).  However,
      only those NRC Proposals defined in other Rules may
      be proposed.

The attempt was made to amend this into a more reasonable form, without 
the proscriptive language, by proposal 1330.  While the proposal did 
pass, it, and many subsequent proposals, failed to contain the 
language preventing them from being NRC proposals by the old 993.  With 
the Injunction of 727, the gamestate rests between opposing poles which 
TaL names, in a CFJ of eir own, the Normal Game State (One where the 
Injunction is overturned), and the Pink Gamestate (One where the 
Injunction is upheld).  This crisis results in the first records I have 
of Players discussing something close to ratification, which came much 
later.  It also shows that the Platonist/Pragmatist divisions in Agora
extend back into pre-history.  From a dialogue between Kelly and TaL;

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Kelly writes:
  >
  >KUNNE> (It might be that the Platonists disagree. However, ccording
  >KUNNE> to my Pragmatist's view, the fact that the Injunction with CFJ
  >KUNNE> 727 was illegal, does not mean that it wasn't issued. In other

  >KUNNE> implies that Michael issued an Injunction.)

  >to take place.

  That, of course, is the Platonist viewpoint.

  Let's put it this way.
  Suppose on October 1, we have a Rule Set with Rules upto 1299.
  Between 1 and 15 October proposals 1300 up to 1350 are submitted
  distributed and adopted. Hence the Oct. 15 Rule set has Rules up to
  1350.

  Next some CFJ Judges that 1300 up to 1350 were distributed illegally.
  In the Platonic view they never happened. Is the Game state now the
  same as on Oct 1?

  Answer: no.
  We are now October 15, meaning that there are other Players On Hold
  and several other things happened between 1 and 15 October.

  The fact that the Game evolved can *not* be ignored.

  What happened in the Game, was that 1300-1350 were distributed and 
  were *subsequently* Judged illegal. Those illegal acts happened. You 
  can not ignore them.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In a flash of Prophecy, a new player, kId AnarKY, says about the
indeterminacy crisis;

     "Would it be possible to pass a proposal accepting the current
      Gamestate as legal?  It would be one of those Non-Rule Changing
      Proposals I've been hearing about."

Which is a future echo of how the much-later Immunity crisis was
eventually resolved.


========================================================================
            This is Who We Are: The demise of SLOWDOWN!

The beginning of December also brought something else, the last in a 
series of anonymous messages from a group (not a Group) called
SLOWDOWN!  
The first messages were mostly pleas for caution in rule changes, and 
needles at Reform's perceived legislative failures.

A view of what SLOWDOWN! felt was excessive can be glimpsed by what an 
admitted SLOWDOWN! member, Vlad, said later;

    "As for Rule Reform, I think we should proceed in a modular way. 
     First, disable all "extras" such as Mutability,NPRC's and multi-
     part proposals."

Or TaL;

    "My problem with the Reforms is that they take too much attention
     away from what I would like to see. That is, more different Nomic
     Entities and interactions between them.

     Instead we seem to be concentrating on details of the parlementary 
     proces, details which interest me only moderately.

     An example from which I still hold a Grudge: the beginning 
     complexity we had (with Marks, Stocks and Points all interacting) 
     was blindly repealed without any attempt at replacing it by 
     something more logic or elaborate."

The Reform position, which attracted opposition from SLOWDOWN!, was 
stated succinctly by Kelly;

   "the idea of the Reform process was to get rid of a lot of obnoxious,
    and in some cases, dangerous, nits and flaws in the parliamentary
    process so that we could more readily proceed to create such things.
    i have, on the back burner, many interesting concepts along such
    lines, as do many other Players.  however, the daunting complexity
    of proposing them with the current proposal system led me to the
    inescapable conclusion that the proposal system itself was flawed 
    and needed fixing before moving onward.  upon finding strong 
    minority support for such i set out to do so."

SLOWDOWN!'s demise came from an anonymous message falsly claiming to be 
from them. It was a truly nasty broadside against the Reform Group, 
Player Kelly, and Agora as a whole.  The falsified message was so over 
the top that, and produced such bad feelings, that on December 5, 1994, 
Player Kojen publishes SLOWDOWN!'s swan song:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

                           THE TRUTH ABOUT SLOWDOWN!


It is time to get this nasty business behind us and move ahead in a
constructive cooperative manner. The hard feelings resulting from the
Slowdown affair have been way out of proportion, and genuinly surprising
to me.

Please read the following with thoughtfulness and without predjudice.


WHO ARE THEY?

Slowdown was a loose alliance between Players sharing at least some
common interests. It numbered at least six Players. Some of the names
may surprise you, including some of the oldest members of Agora. I was
one. One other has already come out.  I'll let the others surface when
if/when they desire.


WHY THE ANON POSTINGS?

The idea to use anonymous postings was not mine, but I stand behind the
decision firmly and completely. We wanted the ideas to be considered
completely in isolation, with absolutely no distractions from political
alliances, personal likes/dislikes, etc.

That Players were not able to do this (i.e., consider the ideas in
isolation) is very disturbing to me. That some Players were threatened
by the anonymity is also puzzling. I know for a fact that had I not been
a member of Slowdown, I would have received the coming of anon postings
to Agora with fascination and amusement.

Anon messages were posted by at least three of us. Furthermore, at least
one of us has forwarded messages from other members who couldn't get the
anon posting to work.


WHO INSULTED THE AGORANS?

I deeply regret the abusive nasty message posted last week. I give you
my word that this was not mine, and it was an absolutely despicable
thing to do. I feel that I know the other members well enough to say
that there is virtually no chance that any of the Slowdown members
posted it. This leaves us Agorons to confront the liklihood that one of
us has posted a thoroughly obnoxious, rude, and insulting message
attacking all Agorans, using the veil of anonymity to hide emself.

As Ronald said, this person should be thoroughly ashamed, and should
come out immediately with a thorough and sincere apology. E should also
consider taking a temporary leave of absence, in my opinion.


WHERE DOES SLOWDOWN STAND?

Slowdown has never posted anything but calls for caution and appeals to
the common sense, intelligence, and good judgement of all Agorans. We do
not advocate anything else. We are not obstructionist, anti-Reform,
anti-Kelly, anti-Rules, or anything of the sort.

I believe that the chaos we're in now says much about the need for
caution in Rule Change Reform. But has there been caution? No. Ever
since we changed the immutables to make them semimutable we have been
changing things with the speed and recklessness of a runaway train.

Can you keep up? I certainly can't. I wish I could, but there is simply
too much going on, Agora and otherwise.

I believe, and I think several of us Agorans do, that there are better,
clearer ways to achieve meaningful Rule Change Reform, and I support
these. I just want the time to explore these before going off in a
direction that is -- let's face it -- the product of one or at most two
Agorans. That is why we all must slow down. 


THE FUTURE OF SLOWDOWN

Slowdown is over. I will no longer identify with Slowdown. The hard
feelings generated by the anon postings, the misperception of its
message as obstructionist, and, most significantly, the disgusting abuse
of its good name by an antisocial imposter, has forever destroyed
whatever chance there was for the name of Slowdown to be regarded with
the respect it should have.

The message is not over. The movement is not over. Now that the facts
are known, all Agorans can make their own decisions and carry on the
movement, suitably modified to fit the mindset of each individual
Agoran. Think and act carefully. The future of Agora is defined not only
by your activity equally by your inactivity.


IN CONCLUSION

To conclude, I simply want to reiterate that this is not a hostile
movement, but rather a cautious one. Please reconsider everything that
has been said in the fresh light that this new openness should
encourage, and make careful decisions. We're in kind of a mess right
now. We have immediate repairs to do and then we must go down that long
road and tackle real, long lasting, directed Rule Reform. It will not be
easy.

-- KoJen


P.S. It was suggested by one member that I put all the members on the
signature. However, I would not do this until permission was given from
all the members. Since this could take several days, and because I want
to get this over with, I decided to go ahead immediately with just my
signature. It is my believe that the above represents the feelings of
the former Slowdown, more or less. I encourage all former members to
come forward now, and endorse the above either in full or in part,
stating where they agree or disagree.

=======================================================================
Other Notable events, first week of December 1994:

The first version of Claims of Error is protoed by kelly.

It is beginning to be understood that the original Kudo Rule is deeply 
flawed, and Kudo transfers may not in fact be possible.

The first version of Concurring Opinions is protoed by kId AnarKY.

There is much talk on n-d of whether past Judgements are a part of Game 
Custom or not.

Kelly begins the ill-fated uNomic project.
