H. Promotor General Chaos,

I hereby submit the following Proposal, paying 1.7 P-Notes to the Bank
to raise its Priority to 1.7.

####
Proposal
Actions With Real Support

[Comment: the point of having Actions With N Supporters is surely that
the Support is supposed to come from other Players. Currently, a person
can Support their own action, which in the case of Actions With One
Supporter, is equivalent to simple authority to perform the action.]

Be it hereby resolved that R1874 (Actions With N Supporters) be amended
by replacing in it the text which currently reads:

      (b) between the two posts, N or more Players posted to the Public
          Forum supporting the change.

with text which reads:

      (b) between the two posts, N or more Players other than the Player
          intending to make the change posted to the Public Forum supporting 
	  the change.

####
