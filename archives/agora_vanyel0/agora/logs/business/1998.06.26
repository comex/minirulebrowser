[Note from the Distributor: this message was trapped by majordomo
because Blob sent it from an address from which he is not subscribed.
Note that it is datestamped an hour before his subsequent message
executing an ACO, sent from his regular address to the PF.]

This is an Application to Create an Organisation.

In order to celebrate the occasion of Agora's fifth Birthday, there

The Regulations of the Contest are as follows:

   A Contestant may leave the contest at any time, by informing the
   Contestmaster that e wishes to do so. Contestants may also be
   required to leave the Contest, as the Regulations dictate.

   moment in time, held by one Player. Initially the Parcel is held

   to another Contestant, by posting a message to the Contestmaster
   and all Contestants stating that e does so. 

3. Seating Arrangements

   The Contestmaster shall keep an ordered list of all Contestants.
   This list is called the "Seating List", and shall be sent to
   all Contestants. After the Music begins, the Contestmaster may
   not change the Seating List, except to remove any Contestants
   who leave the Contest.

4. The Layers

   The Parcel has five Layers, each of which contains a certain 
   number of VTs. Before the Music begins, the Contestmaster shall

   Layer, such that the total number of VTs in the Parcel is no
   less than five. 

   The contents of each layer shall be written down by the 
   Contestmaster, and encrypted using a Public Key Encryption
   algorithm. The encrypted message, and the public encryption key
   shall be sent to all Contestants. Otherwise, the Contestmaster
   shall not reveal the contents of each Layer until that Layer 
   is opened. 

5. The Music Pauses

   The Music shall pause four times, at times selected by the 
   Contestmaster. These times shall lie between midnight (GMT +1200) 
   on the morning of July 29, and 11:59 PM (GMT +1200) on July 30.

   Before the Music begins, the Contestmaster shall write down these
   four times, encrypt them using a Public Key Encryption algorithm, 
   and send the encrypted message, and the public encryption key to
   all Contestants. Otherwise, the Contestmaster shall not reveal
   these times to any Player until after they have passed.

   When the Music pauses, a Layer of the Parcel shall be opened,
   and the Player who held the Parcel immediately before the Player
   who currently holds it, shall receive the contents of that Layer.

6. The Music Stops

   The Music stops at midnight (GMT +1200) the night of Agora's 
   Birthday.
   
   At this time the fifth and final Layer of the Parcel shall be
   opened, and the Player who held the Parcel immediately before 
   the Player who currently holds it, shall receive the contents 
   of that Layer.

7. Passing the Parcel

   As soon as possible after the Music begins, the Contestmaster
   shall Pass the Parcel to the first Contestant on the Seating List.

   Thereafter, the Contestant who hold the Parcel shall pass it to 
   the next Contestant on the List, with the last Contestant on the
   List passing to the first Contestant on the List.

   If a Contestant passes the Parcel to any other Contestant, other
   than as proscribed above, then e shall leave the Contest.

   If a Contestant holds the Parcel for more than six hours straight,
   e shall leave the Contest, and the Parcel shall automatically be
   passed to the next Contestant on the List.

8. Currency Transfers

   All currency transfers required by these Regulations shall be 
   made by the Contestmaster as soon as possible after the 
   Contest has sufficient funds to do so.

9. Dissolving the Contest

   After the Music has stopped, and all required Currency Transfers
   have been made, the Contestmaster shall dissolve the Contest.
   Any currencies remaining in the Contest Treasury at this time 
   shall be transferred to the Contestmaster.

I hereby submit the following Application, and sign it.

Blob

[Note: Although an ACO has already been posted for a contest 
 with this name, it was not signed, and so no such contest 
 exists. Therefore I am free to submit another ACO for a 
 contest with the same name.]

PS: I don't think this means that people who have already asked 
to join need to do so again. Currenly I have Steve, Harlequin,
Kolja and Crito as contestants. Any more?
