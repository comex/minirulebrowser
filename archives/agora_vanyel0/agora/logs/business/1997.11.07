I had thought to create a Will for The Threat, as the old distribution
provisions using the Group Ordinances are no longer effective.

Before doing so (and actually mere minutes before I was about to do so) I
did a routine check of the Rules for such things and to my horror noticed:

================================
Rule 1637/1 (Power=1)
Wills

      A Will is an SLC.  The Jurisdiction of a Will is always empty.
      Each Will is associated with exactly one entity. [...]

      [...] The effect of Executing such an Application is to
      create a Will associated with that entity.  Any prior Will
      associated with that entity is destroyed at the same time.


================================
Rule 766/8 (Power=1)
Groups

      [...] An SLC associated with a Group is that Group's
      Ordinances. [...]

================================

So what happens if a Group executes an ACW?  I'm not totally sure, but one
rather plausible reading is:

 - the Will instantly becomes the Group's Ordinances,
 - then the jurisdiction of the Group is empty by Rule 1637,
 - so the Group is dissolved by Rule 1397(i),
 - and enters Probate, etc.

Any group filing a Will faces a distinct risk of having it activated
instantly...  Or at least a long CFJ fight over the issue.

Wishing to change this situation I offer the following:

================================================================
ProtoProposal
Clarify probate for Groups

Amend Rule 1637 (Wills) to read:

      A Will is an SLC.  The Jurisdiction of a Will is always empty.
      Each Will belongs to exactly one entity.  The Notary
      shall be the Maintainer of all Wills.

      A Will shall specify the heirs of the entity to which it
      belongs, and how the currencies possessed by that entity and
      its other assets will be divided amongst those heirs when that
      treasury is placed in Probate.  When an entity's Will is
      executed, the Executor in Probate of that entity will first
      submit all the Transfer Orders required by the Will (excepting
      those which e cannot execute or cannot execute successfully, for
      whatever reason), and will then divide the remaining residual
      assets as provided by the Will.

      A Will is created or amended by the Execution of an Application
      to Create a Will.  Such an Application must clearly identify the
      entity to which the Will is to belong, requires the
      Signature of the Executor of the entity to which the Will is
      to belong, and is Executed by submitting it to the
      Notary.  The effect of Executing such an Application is to
      create a Will belonging to that entity.  Any prior Will
      belonging to that entity is destroyed at the same time.

      A Will belonging to an Organization is not an SLC associated to
      that Organization, as defined elsewhere.

{ Avoids the phrase "associated with" which also occurs in the definition
of Organizations; replaces it with "belongs to" which fits well with the
concept of it being the "Entity's" will.  Appends a clarifying sentence to
make sure.  Fixes a typo in the original Rule. }

================================================================


Does this fix the problem?  Does anyone object to it?

Regards,
-- elJefe

Chuck, the informal annotation on Rule 1339 (regarding CFJ 822) seems
to be outdated.  You may wish to review its appropriateness.

The following is my intended Judgement in CFJ 1067, offered for
comments prior to formal submission.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This case concerns the effectiveness of an attempted amendment to Rule
by Proposal 3575, which stated that a sentence was to be "added" to a
given paragraph of Rule 1632.  The Rulekeepor stipulates that the term
"added" is ambiguous, in that it does not specify where the sentence
is to be added.  Petitioner Kolja A. asserts that the obvious intent
of the proposal is to append the specified sentence, and that the term
"add" should be taken as a gloss for "append".  This Court holds that
such a gloss, while probably appropriate in this case, is inconsistent
with Rule 1339.

Proposal 3575, adopted Thursday, October 30th and engrossed later that
same day, sought to amend Rule 1632 by "adding" a sentence to the end
of the third paragraph.  Rulekeepor Chuck, in his announcement of Rule
Changes due to Proposals 3555-3576, announced that Proposal 3575
failed to amend Rule 1632 due to ambiguity, citing Rule 594 as basis
for his conclusion.  Upon query, Rulekeepor Chuck stated that the
amendment "doesn't say where in the third paragraph the sentence is to
be added."

Petitioner Kolja A. (also the author of Proposal 3575) argues in his
petition that the clear intent of the Proposal is that the specified
sentence be appended to the specified paragraph, and seeks to invoke
Rule 754 to take "add" as a gloss for "append" in this case.  This
Court rejects this notion.  Rule 754 is only invokable when there is
no ambiguity in meaning.  "Add" is not an unambiguous substitute for
"append".  Prepending would also be a form of "adding", and clearly
prepending and appending are not substitutable for each other.  This
Court therefore feels that the suggested gloss would act to
disambiguate and is thus not permitted by Rule 754.

Petitioner further argues that the only interpretation of this Rule
Change which would make the Rule make sense grammatically is to append
the suggested sentence.  However, this Court sees no reason to
introduce a principle that Rule Changes must be interpreted in the
fashion which "makes the most sense."  It is not the place of the
Rulekeepor to impose rationality on the Electorate's decisions, and if
the Electorate chooses to amend a Rule into a form which is
gramatically contorted or otherwise foolishly constructed, the
Rulekeepor is not entitled to "reinterpret" their intent so as to
avoid that situation.  This Court reflects that, for a time, due to an
error in specification, two paragraphs of either Rule 1434 or Rule
1445 read identically; would Petitioner grant the Rulekeepor the power
to ignore the written word of the Proposal and amend the "intended"
paragraph instead?

Nor is Petitioner's argument that the Rulekeepor is permitted to
reformat paragraphs and otherwise manipulate the appearance of Rules
convincing.  Rule 1339 specifically exempts capitalization and
whitespace from its exactness requirement, suggesting that these
things should not be taken as significant in statutory construction.
The Rulekeepor's modification of these things should not not,
therefore, affect the meaning of the Rules, and is therefore
reasonably permissible (although this Court would likely frown upon
the Rulekeepor were he to arbitrarily capitalize words within Rules in
the manner of his predecessor, and this opinion should be in no way
taken to hold that the Rulekeepor has an unlimited power to change the
capitalization of words within Rules).  The scope of this privilege
cannot reasonably be extended to include moving clauses or sentences
about within the text of a Rule, however; nor should it be extended to
include the power to disambiguate an ambiguously specified Rule
Change, even when one particular disambiguation is clearly preferable
over the other options.

While this Court is sympathetic to Petitioner's argument, it is
clearly foreclosed by Rule 1339.  The determination of the Rulekeepor
is affirmed.  Judgement of FALSE is entered.

Re: Bank Transaction Notices on Nov. 5

In working on my P-Note report, I noticed the following problem.

<snip>

POP040 and POP041 were vacated Payment Orders.  A COE established that these
two Payment Orders should have had Kolja rather than Steve as the Payee. 
Unfortunately, Chancellor General Chaos seems to have missed this when drawing
up eir Bank Transaction Notices.  E meant to satisfy POP045 and POP046, 2
P-Notes each to Kolja.  These two POs are still outstanding.

I can't find anything in the Rules which allows a COE on a Transfer Order to
make corrections.  My impression is it will take a CFJ with an Injunction to
get the P-Notes back from Steve (unless e gives them back voluntarily).  Am I
right, or have I missed something?

The following have voted or declared presence on INP 350:

Crito, Kolja A., Steve and Swann.

Let me remind you that, IIRC, at the beginning of our referendum on
this we had 17 active players, so quorum is 5.

Kolja A.

P.S. As a funny side note: I first intended to just say how many
players had voted, without naming them. However, according to 452,
this would mean committing the Crime of Electioneering, although it
would have conveyed less information than the present mail - the only
exception 452 allows is an explicit list of entities that have
voted. Sometimes, more (information) is less (illegal).

After deep and serious consideration, I have decided to cast my lot with
the zombie resistance, and hence I hereby cast 2 Votes FOR Proposal 3581.

"What disqualifies war from being a true game is probably what
also disqualifies the stock market and business-the rules are
not fully known nor accepted by all the players. Furthermore, 
the audience is too fully participatory in war and business, 
just as in a native society there is no true art because everybody
is engaged in making art. Art and games need rules, conventions,
and spectators. They must stand forth from the over-all situation
as models of it in order for the quality of play to persist."

If anyone is interested, I am, until further notice, Proposing
all my Proposals in the PF.  Since I came (back) to Agora penniless
I would be gratful for anyone who has a spare P-Note and wishes to
Sponsor any of those proposals that they'd feel would pass.
So far I think the one undistributed one is my Proposal for
Proposal Applications-- (I took a lack of comment on the Proto
as a sign of its uncontriversial nature.)

Anyway, there it is.  If such a proposal passes, such an investment
will be its own reward :)
