I hereby cast the following votes:

Proposal 3830: FOR x 2
Proposal 3831: Present
Proposal 3832: Present

As I calculate, that will leave me with .4 VTs. Since that's
no good to me, I will transfer them to the first Player who
votes for Proposal 3830.

This message contains exactly one Proposal.  The Proposal begins
immediately after the line marked "**START PROPOSAL" and ends at the
end of the message.
  
The following Proposal is to be titled "Normalization of 1807" and is
to have Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1807 be amended to read:

      (a) Since Appellate Orders cannot be appealed, Appellate Orders
          are valid only if directed to:
        (1) The Clerk of the Courts in eir Official capacity;
        (2) an Order issued by the Clerk of the Courts in eir Official
            Capacity;
        (3) The Judge of the CFJ which that Board of Appeals was
            convened to consider, or any Order issued by that Judge in
            that particular CFJ; or
        (4) any combination of the above.

      (b) All other Appellate Orders are presumptively invalid.

      (c) This Rule takes precedence over all Rules pertaining to the
          validity of Appellate Orders.

The Adoption Index of P3831 is only 1, and need only be 1 to repeal
R1486. Perhaps you got the AI confused with the Priority?

This is a Claim of Error.

I call for Judgement on the following Statement, barring General Chaos
and Andre.

Statement:

General Chaos' message to agora-business, dated Thu Feb 4 04:47:07 1999,
with message-id < 199902041242.HAA2542-@poverty.bloomington.in.us >,
initiated a Referendum to Impeach Chancellor Andre.

Argument:

As is usual, I begin with the facts. The full text of the General's
message, which was sent to the Public Forum, is as follows. Replying to
a message from Andre, he wrote (text delimited by triple hyphens):

---
"Andre" == Andre Engels < engel-@win.tue.nl > writes:

Andre> I hereby again set the BOS to zero Voting Tokens.

Anybody who thinks I'm going to work for free while the Duty to Vote
exist is daft.

I hereby call for the Impeachment of Chancellor Andre.
---

Now, the Rules. Rule 1486 (Procedure to Impeach an Officer) states in
part that:

      Any Active Player is permitted to call a Referendum to Impeach an
      Officer at any time, by requesting such in the Public Forum... The
      Referendum must list both the Office and the current Electee to
      that Office by name. 

General Chaos insists that because he did not use the word 'Referendum'
in his message, for example by saying "I hereby call for a Referendum to
Impeach Chancellor Andre", that his message did not succeed in
initiating a Referendum to Impeach Chancellor Andre. I disagree. I hold
the contrary view that in the context (i.e., the existence of R1486),
specific use of the word 'Referendum' was not necessary to initiate a
Referendum to Impeach, and that a reasonable person would interpret his
message as a call for a Referendum to Impeach Chancellor Andre. To
insist that the use of the word "Referendum" is necessary to initiate a
Referendum is to insist on an absolutely strict adherence to rigidly
defined forms of words that is not in the best interests of the game. If
allowed to stand, this ultra-finicky legalism will set a dangerous
precedent. It might, to give just one example, allow the Assessor to
discount a message of the form "6666: FOR" (following the distribution
of Proposal 6666) as a vote for Proposal 6666, on the grounds that
neither the words 'vote' nor 'Proposal' appear in the message. I ask the
Judge to reject such insults to commonsense and deliver a Judgement of
TRUE.

I don't think there's much to argue about in this line of reasoning. If
the Payment Order for Kolja's votes on the previous week's Proposals had
been executed when Proposals 3829-3830 were distributed, then perhaps
there might be the beginnings of a case for denying effective control,
although I tend to think it would still be a pretty flimsy one.

However, a completely different and (it seems to me) quite powerful line
of attack has just now occurred to me, one that seems to me very much in
the spirit of what Kolja was trying to achieve by granting me his Power
of Attorney in the first place. I therefore call for Judgement on the
following Statement, barring Blob:

Statement:

  Kolja did not have effective control of more than three Voting Tokens
  at the time Proposals 3829-3830 were distributed, because he had
  granted Power of Attorney to Steve.

Argument:

Kolja granted me his Power of Attorney commencing on 01 Feb 1999 00:00
GMT, about five and a half hours before Proposals 3829-3830 were
distributed (at Mon, 01 Feb 1999 00:36:00 -0500, according to the
Assessor's Report of the results).

Now, R1842 states that:

      When the Holder is granted Power of Attorney for the Grantor, that
      means that the Holder becomes the sole Executor for the Grantor
      for as long as e has that Power of Attorney.

So while I hold Kolja's Power of Attorney, I am Kolja's sole Executor.
In particular, this means that Kolja is not his own Executor, and is
therefore incapable of executing Transfer Orders, at least of a kind
which the Recordkeepor is required to record (see R1817). According to
the definition of "effective control of an asset" in R1873,

      Effective control of an asset (e.g., a unit of Currency) is the
      ability to dispose of that asset as one wishes.

But Kolja manifestly cannot dispose of his assets as he wishes while I
hold his Power of Attorney, for he cannot dispose of his assets at all;
only I can do so, as his sole Executor. Hence Kolja did not have
effective control of any assets whatsoever when Proposals 3829-3830 were
distributed, and could not have incurred a Duty to Vote on those
Proposals.

Going through the Ruleset I see that the title of Zeitgeist is currently
not revoked when a new one is awarded. I remember that this used to be the
case, and would like to see the former texts of Rule 1047 and/or the text
of Proposals 2486, 2522, 2747, 2829, 3463, 3474, 3533, 3717 and 3801, so that
I know which players currently hold this title.

Well, real life has become very interesting of late, and far too time

No. This is utter crap. Scott's little 'explanation' of his snafu
didn't arrive in my mailbox until after I had cast my votes. I
refuse to be screwed over by this. I hereby COE Blob's claim that
I voted for his Proposal "Actions With N Supporters".

Argument: Scott gave my Proposal number 3830. That was perfectly
legal, even though it didn't meet the requirements of 109. Nothing
prohibits the Promotor from giving any identifier he wants to a 
proposal, in addition to the official number. Now, it is also not a
requirement that a Voter specify the official number when voting on
a Proposal. So I claim I was identifying my Proposal based on its
unofficial number (although I didn't know it was unofficial at the
time.) My identification was clearly ambiguous; so Blob has the
right to discard my votes. Or he can apply them to 3833. What he can't
do is provide incontrovertible evidence that I intended to vote on
Proposal 3830(3830) instead of Proposal 3830(3833).

If the above argument is not accepted, I expect G. Chaos to do the
right thing and reimburse me for the VTs lost due to his error.

Otherwise, it will be a cold day in hell before you see me pay my debt
for these so-called votes.

I hereby cast the following Votes:

3833: 2 x FOR

Of course, if Blob accepts my arguments that I have already cast votes
on 3833, the above are invalid. Also, my offer of .4 VTs for the
first Player to vote for 3833 still applies.

Unless I am mistaken, that Payment Order was denominated in
Indulgences.  Pursuant to Rule 1598, I conclude that this Transfer
Order is invalid.

Probably.  Claim admitted; the Assessor will note that the AI of
Proposal 3831 is 1, not 2.

I hereby call for Judgement on the following Statement:

"Vlad's message dated 'Sun, 7 Feb 1999 23:11:01 -0600 (CST)' did not
succeed in casting any Votes on either Proposal 3830 or Proposal
3833; as a result, Payment Orders avt083 and avt085 are invalid and
should be vacated."

I bar Blob and Vlad.

I note that this CFJ disputes the validity of Payment Orders avt083
and avt085, and request the Clerk of the Courts to stay these Orders
pending Judgement.

Argument:

At 20:22:57 EST on 2/7, I (as Promotor) erroneously attempted to
distribute a Proposal called 'The Grand Agoran Tournament' as Proposal
3830.  Since that number had already been used for another Proposal,
such distribution was invalid.  I discovered and announced my error at
20:51:49 EST, about a half-hour later, and distributed the same
Proposal as Proposal 3833 at 21:03:24 EST.

Vlad was aware of my error at as of 00:06:13 EST on 2/8, because he
claimed that the redistribution was in error.  Notwithstanding his
awareness of an error, he proceeded to cast eir votes at 00:11:01 EST.
It seems obvious that Vlad was aware, or should have been aware, that
there was an irregularity in the distribution.

In any case, at the time Vlad cast his votes, there were two Proposals
which a reasonable person might understand to be "Proposal 3830",
although legally only Blob's "Actions with N Supporters" Proposal
bears that number.  Vlad's reference to Proposal 3830 in his Votring
message was therefore ambiguous; hence, his message fails to
successfully communicate to the Assessor which Proposal e is
attempting to cast Votes upon.  Assessor Blob erred in counting these
Votes.

Since the miscounting of Vlad's Votes does not affect the outcome of
Proposal 3830, the only corrective action require is to vacate Payment
Orders avt083 and avt085, and I hereby move the Judge to do so.

Respectfully submitted,

General Chaos

Please see the Herald's and Accountor's reports for confirmation of the
R-O-M's VT and Indulgence holdings.  Note that they are also valid
confirmations of Lee's holdings.

As High Priest of the OEE, I can also confirm the neither the R-O-M
nor Lee hold any Irises.

I would have replied to the General's post, except that the reply
would have automatically gone to A-D and not the PF. I guess I will
do so in the future. I will note that I did have cause to believe that
3830 was the correct number, and not 3833, since my Proposal did
have greater Priority than 3831 and 3832, and Game Custom has
been that Proposals are distributed in order of Priority. In
addition, I did vote on 3829 and 3830 in a seperate message, declaring
Presence on 3830. Although it is legal to cast votes on a Proposal
for which one has declared Presence, I think it does lend to my case
that I was referring to 'my' 3830, and not Blob's.
  The Judge of the CFJ now pending will also have to seriously
consider whether or not my Proposal was distributed as 3830. Rule
109 says that the Promotor has to assign a number to a Proposal 
when it is distributed, but does not link the status of "having
been distributed" to such an act. I claim that my Proposal was
distributed as 3830, and the lack of an official number impinges
on the Promotor, not on the status of the Proposal. My Proposal
was then distributed again as 3833. General Chaos has never claimed
that the distribution of 3830 was in error, merely that it was not
distributed. I claim this is false and therefore none of his
emails on the subject can be construed as COEs, and therefore
my Proposal was distributed twice.  Note the wording of 1770:

	The failure of the Promotor to distribute any of the above
      accompaniments with a Proposal does not deprive the
      distribution of the Proposal of any legal effect.

I hereby make two COEs. One, that 3830 was in fact distributed, and
has yet to be given a legal number, and Two, that the distribution
of 3833 was illegal. If the Promotor wishes to renumber Proposal
3830 he may, but has not yet done so. (Sorry, Scott, I appreciate
your help, but want a backup plan if your CFJ doesn't work).

      (a) Vote Collector: The Vote Collector is the Entity responsible
          for collecting and tallying the Votes and announcing the
          result. This Entity is the Speaker if not otherwise
          specified.

      (b) Voting Entities: Every Player not on Hold may Vote on a
          Referendum.  On Hold status is measured at the time a Player
          sends eir Vote.

      (c) Voting: A Voting Entity Votes by sending eir Vote to the
          Vote Collector during the Voting Period, indicating what
          Referendum e is Voting on, and what eir Vote is.

      (d) Vote Values: A Vote is FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN. Words which
          are effectively synonymous with these are also permissible.

      (e) Vote Strength: Every Vote has equal strength. No Voting
          Entity may Vote more than once on any single Referendum.

      (f) Retraction: A Vote, once sent to the Vote Collector, cannot
          be changed.

      (g) Start of Voting: The Voting Period begins at the time the
          first correct and legal announcement that a Referendum is
          begun, as defined in other Rules, is sent to the Public
          Forum, together with the identity of the Vote Collector.

      (h) Duration of Voting: The Voting Period lasts for one Week.
          All Votes received by the Vote Collector outside of the
          Voting Period have no effect.

      (i) Secrecy During Voting: Unless otherwise specified, the Vote
          Collector may not give away any information about the Votes
          while the Voting is underway.

      (j) This shall in no way prohibit the Vote Collector from
          posting, at any time and to the Public Forum, a list of
          those Players who have already Voted.

      (k) Secrecy After Voting: Unless otherwise specified, the Vote
          Collector shall post to the Public Forum, after the Voting
          Period is over, the number of Votes of each kind as well as
          the name and Vote of each Entity which cast a Vote.

      (l) Adoption Ratio: The Adoption Ratio, the ratio of FOR Votes
          on a Referendum relative to the AGAINST VOTES, must be
          greater than Adotion Index for the Referendum to pass. If it
          is not, the Referendum fails.

      (m) Adoption Index: Unless otherwise specified, the Adoption
          Index for a Referendum is 1.

      (n) Quorum: Quorum shall be set at 50% of the eligible Voting
          Entities at the beginning of the Voting Period. If a smaller
          fraction voted, the Referendum automatically fails.

      (o) Nonperformance by Vote Collector: The Vote Collector must
          perform eir required duties, but if the result of a
          Referendum is not announced within one Week following the
          end of the Voting Period, it automatically fails.

      (p) Effectiveness: the full effects of a Referendum, as defined
          in Rules which make use of the Referendum procedure, come
          into force as of the moment the results are announced to the
          Public Forum.

There is no requirement that the Proposals in a given week's batch be
distributed in any given order, or even all at the same time.  The
only thing the Rules require is that the Proposals in that week's
Batch (and only those Proposals) be distributed that week.  (Actually, 
the language is fuzzy; this clearly needs to be reworked.)

Even if I did distribute your Proposal at the time I distributed 3831
and 3832 (which is a distinct possibility that may very well be
correct), there is no possible way in which it could have been given
the number 3830.  I remind the readers of the situation when Chuck
inadvertently gave two Rules the same number.

Scott> General Chaos has never claimed that the distribution of 3830

There is no requirement that an Officer Claim an Error in eir own
reports before correcting those errors.  (At least not any more; we
had that for a while with Currencies but that was repealed.)

Scott> I hereby make two COEs. One, that 3830 was in fact distributed,
Scott> and has yet to be given a legal number, and Two, that the
Scott> distribution of 3833 was illegal. 

Per my standing policy regarding COEs that speak to legal, rather than 
factual, questions, I deny both of these COEs.  If you want to resolve 
these questions, take it to CFJ.  Please do not abuse the COE
mechanism.

(My personal belief, based on what has been said so far, is that your
Proposal was distributed without a proper number at the same time as
3831 and 3832, and then later given the number 3833, in the message
which you claim to be an illegal distribution.  Since this
interpretation of law and fact is inconsistent with your claims, I
would deny your COEs anyway.  I would admit a Claim of Error regarding
my statements as to when voting began on Proposal 3833.)

The following message contains 2 CFJs.

Mr. Clerk of the Courts, I hereby CFJ on the following statement.
I bar G. Chaos, and Chuck from judging.

The Proposal known as "3830" (see below) was in fact distributed, but
it has not received a number as required by Rule 109.

Arguments: I use the term "3830" to denote the Proposal G. Chaos
tried to distribute with Proposals 3831 and 3832 in his message
of 7 Feb., which he marked with the designation 3830, 
entitled "The Grand Agoran Tournament". This message fit all the
requirements for distribution, except that of having been given an
official number as required by 109. However, by 1770, such omission
does not affect the legality of the Proposal's distribution.
Therefore, Proposal "3830" was distributed, but without a number
as required by 109 (I will hereafter refer to this as the "109
number".
  Now, the second issue, is whether "3830" does currently have a 109
number, namely, 3833. G. Chaos is correct that an Officer does
not have to issue a COE to correct his own report; by CFJ 919 any
correction is to be considered a COE and a response. The question
is, has G. Chaos issued such a correction? No. He proceeded to
redistribute Proposal "3830" a second time, giving this second
issue the number of 3833. Nowhere in the redistribution did he
indicate that this was a correction of his previous message. Can
we consider this an implicit corection? No. The correction
required was the assignment of a 109 number to the already
distributed Proposal "3830". However, G. Chaos' messages to the
PF indicate that he felt "3830" had in fact not been distributed
at all, and that 3833 was a seperate distribution. In fact, now we
know that it was the second distribution of the Proposal. So the
correction, viz. the assignment of a 109 number to "3830", has
never occurred.
  I also request the Judge issue an Order to Compel to General
Chaos requiring him to assign Proposal "3830" a number as required
by Rule 109.


Relevant documentation is below:

Text of Rule 109:
Rule 109/3 (Power=2)
Proposal Numbers

      At the time e distributes it, the Promotor shall give each
      Proposal a Number for reference.  The Number of a Proposal shall
      be the least integer greater than all other Numbers previously
      assigned to a Proposal (including numbers assigned to Proposals
      later determined to have been incorrectly submitted), or 301,
      whichever is greater.

Text of Rule 1770:
Rule 1770/2 (Power=1)
Distributing Proposals

      Each week, the Promotor shall distribute a batch of Proposals.
      These are the only Proposals e is allowed to distribute that
      week.

      If the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue with a
      Priority greater than zero is less than or equal to the Batch
      Size, then the batch shall consist of all such Proposals.

      If the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue is greater
      than the Batch Size, then the batch shall consist of those
      Proposals in the Queue with the highest Priority such that the
      number of Proposals distributed is equal to the Batch Size.

      Once a Proposal is distributed, it is removed from the Proposal
      Queue.

      The Promotor shall distribute each proposal in the batch to the
      Public Forum, accompanied by its Number and the identity of
      its Proposing Entity.

      The failure of the Promotor to distribute any of the above
      accompaniments with a Proposal does not deprive the
      distribution of the Proposal of any legal effect.

      A Proposal is only considered to be legally distributed if it
      is explicitly marked as such. The Promotor is permitted to
      publish the text of undistributed Proposals without necessarily
      distributing them.

Upon reviewing the Rules, it appears to me to appear that Vlad's
Proposal has not yet been distributed, and the other two have.
While the Rules require that I distribute only the Proposals in the
Batch, it does not say that I have to distribute them all at one
time.  Therefore, I will distribute Vlad's Proposal separately as
Proposal 3833 in a few minutes.  My apologies for the confusion.

(It also says that I don't have to distribute the Proposals in the
batch in any particular order.  Hm.)

Annotation to Rule 1431, defining COEs:
[CFJ 919: A PF message correcting an earlier PF message by the
 same player constitutes both a COE and the Response.]


CFJ Number 2:

I also CFJ on the following Statement, barring G. Chaos and Chuck:

Proposal "3833" (see below) was not properly distributed and is not in
fact currently up for vote.

Arguments: By "3833" I mean the Proposal G. Chaos tried to distribute
by itself in his message of 7 Feb., entitled "The Grand Agoran
Tournament" and given the designation 3833. As another CFJ made by
me will determine, Proposal "3833" was in fact distributed earlier,
although at the time of this CFJ it has not been given an official
number. The distribution of "3833" was illegal because at the time
G. Chaos attempted to distribute it, there was no such Proposal in
the queue (it having already been distributed), and a number of
Proposals equal to the batch size had already been distributed
(namely the aforementioned unnumbered Proposal, 3831 and 3832.).
Therefore, G. Chaos had no authority to make such a distribution.

Relevant documentation follows.

Text of Rule 1770:
Rule 1770/2 (Power=1)
Distributing Proposals

      Each week, the Promotor shall distribute a batch of Proposals.
      These are the only Proposals e is allowed to distribute that
      week.

      If the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue with a
      Priority greater than zero is less than or equal to the Batch
      Size, then the batch shall consist of all such Proposals.

      If the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue is greater
      than the Batch Size, then the batch shall consist of those
      Proposals in the Queue with the highest Priority such that the
      number of Proposals distributed is equal to the Batch Size.

      Once a Proposal is distributed, it is removed from the Proposal
      Queue.

      The Promotor shall distribute each proposal in the batch to the
      Public Forum, accompanied by its Number and the identity of
      its Proposing Entity.

      The failure of the Promotor to distribute any of the above
      accompaniments with a Proposal does not deprive the
      distribution of the Proposal of any legal effect.

      A Proposal is only considered to be legally distributed if it
      is explicitly marked as such. The Promotor is permitted to

Okay, it's crunch time. I have to recalculate the Voting Tariff. 
Even with a change in Chancellor, there will be no Voting Tokens entering
our economy until the end of next month. Still, there are a reasonably
large number of VTs in circulation, even after taxes, so I am not going
to give in to Andre's pressure and abandon all efforts at maintaining a
working economy. We can afford to keep paying for our votes for some time
yet.

We do have a problem that VT holdings are currently rather skewed. The
mean holding is 3.78 VTs (after everyone has paid their taxes) but the
median is only 2.80 VTs, indicating that the greater part of our wealth
is being held by a small group of players. I do not intend to limit 
voting to only the rich.

We have seven weeks until the next lot of salaries are paid, and I expect
there to continue to be two or three proposals distributed every week. It
is unrealistic to set the tariff so that every player could afford to
vote on every single proposal. The resulting value would be so close to
zero as to be meaningless, and most of us only really care about one
proposal a week anyway, in my experience.

Also, I notice that General Chaos' Summary Adoption proposal will allow
the adoption of less contraversial proposals without the spending of VTs.
So if it passes, (and I encourage players to support it), we will be 
spending fewer VTs in any case.

So, as a result, I hereby set the Voting Tariff to 0.4 VTs. This will
allow almost all players (myself not included, sadly) to vote on at least
one proposal a week, until the next batch of salaries is paid. By which 
time we will hopefully have a more cooperative Chancellor.

You should've actually paid off the original debt. It will be another
week before POI162 becomes overdue, so you could have delayed the next
Blot by at least a week.

But since you've had it rough recently, partially at my hands, I'll do
you a favour:

I hereby transfer 1 Indulgence to the Bank to satisfy the above PO.
