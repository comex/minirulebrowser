Hi all,

I hereby create, publish, sign and execute an application to form a
new contest called 'MOO builders' Contest' (or MBC, for short), with
initial statutes as appended to this mail.

I hope that this succeeds in creating the contest; if it does, I
hereby transfer 2 VTs from myself to the MBC as my Entrance Fee, ! VT
from myself to the MBC as a voluntary membership Fee for August, and
1VT as an extra gift to the contest.

I invite all other Agorans who qualify to join this contest. There is
quite an attractive amount of VTs to be won!

I also remind all players of Agora of their ability to submit entries
for the MBC competition (see statute 21). Submissions to the
competition, and votes in the survey that decides the competition, can
be contributed by all Agorans, even if they are not members of the
MBC.

Kolja A.


__________
MOO builders' contest statutes (valid 11.8.98)


1. Contestmaster

The first contestmaster is Kolja.

2. Motions

The statutes are changed by adopted motions. A motion is distributed
when a member of the contest sends it to all other members. It is up
for vote for seven days after its distribution. It takes effect when
the contestmaster publishes the voting results to all members after
these seven days, and if the necessary majority of votes cast for the
motion by members of the contest in mails to the contestmaster is
sufficient.

3. Majorities

Motions concerning single digit statutes need a two-thirds majority of
all votes cast to be adopted, others need a simple majority of all
votes cast.

4. Members 

Only players of Agora can become members of this contest. They may
become members by notifying the Contestmaster and paying the Entry Fee
to the contest.


10. Entry and Membership Fees

The Entry Fee for this Contest is 2 VTs.

The Membership Fee, to be paid by each member as soon as possible
after the first day of each month, is 1 VT.


20. The Competition

Every month, this contest organizes a MOO building competition.

It is held in two categories: Best Room and Best Object.

21. Submissions

During the whole month, all Agora players (not just contest members)
may nominate objects of any officially recognized MUD, MOO
etc. created by any member of the contest as entries to the
appropriate category of the competition.

22. Survey

As soon as possible after the first day of each month, the
Contestmaster shall post a complete list of competition submissions
made in the last month to the PF.

For two weeks after this distribution all players of Agora (not just
contest members) may cast one vote in each category of the
competition by notifying the Contestmaster. Members of the contest may
not vote for MOO objects they created themselves.

[Comment: Should we use the Referendum structure given in the rules,
or just a simple homemade survey as described here?]

As soon as possible after the end of this survey period the
Contestmaster shall publish all votes cast in the competition.

23. Rewards

Together with the publication of the survey results, the contestmaster
shall pay out the competition rewards. 

The reward for the winner of each competition category shall be a
fraction of 1/(n+2) of the contest's currency holdings (fractions
rounded down), where n is the number of categories.

[Comment: this assures the contest always has some money left to pay
taxes etc.]

In case of a tied win in a category, the reward shall be divided
evenly among the winners.

24. No rewards for bad debtors

If the winner of a category still owes the contest any currency at the
time e is to receive the reward, and at least one of these debts is
older than two weeks, the reward for this winner shall be cancelled.

25. Officially recognized M**s

AgoraMOO (netdive.com:7777) is an officially recognized MOO.

Shattered World () is an officially recognized MUD.

H. Promotor Crito, 

I hereby submit the following Proposal, paying 1 P-Note to increase
its Priority by 1.

####
Proposal
Permanent Electioneering

[Comment: I think the temporary ban on Electioneering has been a success,
and I'd like to see it made permanent. Permitting the Assessor to use the
information in eir possession as a resource gives the Office much more
interest and scope for creative play.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rules 452 and 1652 be repealed.

####
