That's kind of ironic: it so happens that I, too, have suddenly and
rather unexpectedly, commenced full-time work this week for the first
time in my life. I think my Agoran friends will appreciate the
additional irony that I happen to be working for the Victorian Electoral
Commission. It seems certain that my time for Agora will be drastically
curtailed as a result. We'll have to see if and how I can cope.

Nevertheless, I consent to being granted Kolja's Power of Attorney.

I was going to vote for it anyway, but since you're offering:

I cast one vote for P3827.

Due to (apparent) public demand, I hereby submit this Call for 
Judgement.

The following statement is to be judged.

"The message I sent to the discussion forum, declaring my presence on 
the recent Proposals 3825 and 3826, is valid."

For the following reasons…


Firstly the Vote Collector of these Proposals received my declaration 
through the discussion forum.  Thus satisfying rule 1715.  However rule 
1764 states that,

"Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
any votes, or the declaration of Presence, by Voting Entities
on Proposals, Elections or Referenda, may only be achieved by
sending a message to the Public Forum." 

And by this rule 1764 would take precedence over rule 1715.  Only for 
reasons of if the vote was valid by who it was received by.  However I 
believe that rule 1764 by the virtue of allowing or disallowing votes, 
changes whether or not a proposal has met Quorum.

Now rule 1715 also states that,

"This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which determine
Quorum or whether a Proposal, Election or Referendum has met
Quorum."

And so by this rule 1717 takes precedence over rule 1764, causing a 
contradiction.

Now considering Rule 1030

      If two or more Rules with the same Power conflict with one
      another, then the Rule with the lower Number takes precedence.

      If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of Rule) or
      takes precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supercede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.

      If all of the Rules in conflict explicitly say that their
      precedence relations are determined by some other Rule for
      determining precedence relations, then the determinations of
      the precedence determining Rule shall supercede the numerical
      method for determining precedence.

      If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

In this case I believe the last paragraph comes into force, and so rule 
1715 takes precedence over rule 1764 for all contradictions between the 
two rules.  In particular a declaration of presence is valid if sent to 
the collector of votes for a given proposal, and so does not necessarily 
have to be sent to a public forum.

Secondly,  if for whatever reason the argument  above does not hold, 
making declaration valid only if sent to a public forum.  I believe that 
my message did satisfy being sent to a public forum.  For the following 
reasons…

Rule 478 states

      Sending a message, by any medium or combination of media, to
      every Active Player, is equivalent to sending it to the Public
      Forum, provided that the message bears a clear indication that
      it is intended to be a message to the Public Forum, and it is
      verifiable that the message was in fact sent to every Active
      Player.

I believe that my declaration was sent to every active player, and also 
that this is verifiable.  Also as (for the reasons of the above argument 
failing) such a message has to be sent to a public forum to be valid.  
This would give a clear indication that it was indeed intended for a 
public forum.  

Further evidence also suggests that people though the message was 
intended for a public forum.  People not realizing themselves that it 
had been sent to public forum told me that the message should be posted 
to a public forum.   Surely they would not tell me to send the message 
to a public forum, if it was not clear to them that it was intended to 
be sent to a public forum.

Also note that nearly all declarations such as the one I sent arrive at 
a public forum (sooner or later).  This would also suggest that my 
message was intended for a public forum.


If any parts of my arguments are unclear then I will gladly try to give 
you more information, and explanations that might make them clearer.

Peekee

Sorry, the statement in the call for judgement should of read "was" not  
"is".  If you could kindly ignore it and consider this one.  I know that 
this will not have much relevance but it should help to set precedences 
and also show if any rule changes might be useful.

I hereby submit this Call for Judgement.

The following statement is to be judged.

"The message I sent to the discussion forum, declaring my presence on 
the recent Proposals 3825 and 3826, was valid at that time."

I believe the above statement is true for the following reasons.

Firstly the Vote Collector of these Proposals received my declaration 
through the discussion forum.  Thus satisfying rule 1715.  However rule 
1764 states that,

"Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of

3826: 2*FOR

I am going on vacation while being required to Serve, and the only
Proposal I have come up with is not ready for being proposed at this
stage. Thus, the only way I see of avoiding the penalty is to repeal the
Rule.

Here is my alternative formulation of Gen Chaos' "Make the Proposal 
Queue More Competitive" proposal. I have already explained in agora-
discussion why I reckon it is a better way to go about it.

I freely admit that I borrowed heavily from the General's proposal
in creating this one. If he wishes, I will share with him the P-Note 
reward, if any, for its passage.

Proto-proposal: Changing the Bar Height

Create a rule, with title "The Priority Bar", and text:

      (a) The Priority Bar is the minimum Priority needed for a 
          Proposal to be distributed. It is a real number between
          zero and two.

      (b) Upon the adoption of the proposal which created this rule,
          its value shall be set to one.


      (c) The Promotor may change the value of the Priority Bar by
          announcing its new value in the Public Forum, provided that
          the new value is within the range allowed by subdivision (a)
          of this Rule.

      (d) Whenever a new value is announced according to subdivision
          (c) of this Rule, the new value takes effect at the
          beginning of the next Nomic Week, unless the announcement is
          made within three days of the end of the current Nomic Week,
          in which case the new value takes effect at the beginning of
          the Nomic Week following the next Nomic Week.

Amend Rule 1036 by replacing the text:

      A Proposal's Priority is an integer value. All Proposals
      initially have a Priority of zero.

with:

      A Proposal's Priority is a real number. All Proposals
      initially have a Priority of zero.

Amend Rule 1771 to read:

      A Player may increase or decrease the Priority of a Proposal
      in the Queue by announcing to the Public Forum that e does so,
      and paying a number of P-Notes to the Bank. 

      The Priority of the Proposal is increased or decreased, as 
      specified by the Player making the payment, by an amount equal
      to the number of P-Notes transferred to the Bank, provided 
      that this transfer is not executed for any other purpose.

Amend Rule 1770 by replacing the text:

      If the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue with a
      Priority greater than zero is less than or equal to the Batch
      Size, then the batch shall consist of all such Proposals.

      If the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue is greater
      than the Batch Size, then the batch shall consist of those
      Proposals in the Queue with the highest Priority such that the
      number of Proposals distributed is equal to the Batch Size.

with:

      If the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue with a
      Priority greater than or equal to the Priority Bar is less than 
      or equal to the Batch Size, then the batch shall consist of all 
      such Proposals.

      Otherwise, the batch shall consist of those Proposals in the 
      Queue with the highest Priority such that the number of 
      Proposals distributed is equal to the Batch Size.

Amend Rule 1701 by replacing the text:

      The MUQ of P-Notes is 1.

with

      The MUQ of P-Notes is 0.1.
