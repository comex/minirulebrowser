H. Accountor,

I thought I had already voted on these, but can't find any records of
my votes. Maybe they were lost in a server crash at our department
last week. Anyway, if (and only if) I haven't already done so, I
hereby vote as follows:

                    3    3  3  3
                    7    7  7  7
                    4    5  5  5
                    9    2  3  4

Kolja A             *    *  F  

Thanks, 

Kolja A.
