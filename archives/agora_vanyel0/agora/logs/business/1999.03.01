H. Assessor,

As a result of the above Voting POs, Murphy and Vlad are both guilty

Yes it is.  I don't remember seeing a stay order, I'm afraid.  Could the
Judge please confirm that this PO was stayed pending the CFJ
decision?

Thank you.  I hereby vacate the order denying Vlad Voting Privileges.
This also means that e was not guilty of PI for VTs and I hereby
vacate POI177, as well.

This message contains exactly one Proposal.  The Proposal begins
immediately after the line marked "**START PROPOSAL" and ends at the
end of the message.
  
The following Proposal is to be titled "Eliminate Transfer Orders" and
is to have Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it resolved, that Rule 1799 be amended to read:

      Any Order may always be amended, stayed, or vacated by the
      Player (or, in the case of Appellate Orders, Board of Appeal)
      who executed it.  Certain classes of Orders may be amended,
      stayed, or vacated in other circumstances as well, when the
      Rules so allow.  In all cases, this is done by an Order to
      Amend, Stay, or Vacate, respectively, the original Order.

      Otherwise, an Order shall not be amended, stayed, vacated, or
      otherwise changed once executed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1637 be amended to read:

      A Will is an SLC.  The Jurisdiction of a Will is always empty.
      Each Will belongs to exactly one entity.  The Notary shall be
      the Maintainer of all Wills.

      A Will shall specify the heirs of the entity to which it
      belongs, and how the currencies possessed by that entity and its
      other assets will be divided amongst those heirs when that
      entity is placed in Probate.  When an entity's Will is executed,
      the Executor in Probate of that entity will first execute all
      the transfers required by the Will (excepting those which e
      cannot execute or cannot execute successfully, for whatever
      reason), and will then divide the remaining residual assets as
      provided by the Will.

      A Will is created or amended by the Execution of an Application
      to Create a Will.  Such an Application must clearly identify the
      entity to which the Will is to belong, requires the Signature of
      the Executor of the entity to which the Will is to belong, and
      is Executed by submitting it to the Notary.  The effect of
      Executing such an Application is to create a Will belonging to
      that entity.  Any prior Will belonging to that entity is
      destroyed at the same time.

      A Will belonging to an Organization is not an SLC associated to
      that Organization, as defined elsewhere.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1727 be amended, by replacing the
paragraph reading:

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that, not less than seven days prior to
      Agora's Birthday, the Chancellor shall, on behalf of the Bank,
      submit delayed Transfer Orders to be executed at 00:04:30 GMT
      +1200 on Agora's Birthday to each Player for the amount of 3 VTs
      each;

with a paragraph reading

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that, as close to Agora's Birthday as
      possible, the Chancellor shall, on behalf of the Bank, execute
      transfers of 3 VTs to each Player;

and by replacing the paragraph reading:

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Chancellor shall, on behalf of
      the Bank, submit Transfer Orders for one P-note each from the
      Bank to each Player who posts to the Public Forum during Agora's
      Birthday a message recognizing Agora's Birthday; these Transfer
      Orders to be executed as soon as possible after Agora's Birthday
      ends;

with a paragraph reading

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Chancellor shall, on behalf of
      the Bank, execute transfers for one P-note each from the Bank to
      each Player who posts to the Public Forum during Agora's
      Birthday a message recognizing Agora's Birthday; these transfers
      to be executed as soon as possible after Agora's Birthday ends;

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1730 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1732 be amended to read:

      A Payment Order is only satisfied when a transfer to the payee
      of that Payment Order for the currency and amount named in that
      Payment Order is successfully executed, provided that, when that
      transfer was executed, its executor clearly indicated that that
      transfer was being executed for the purpose of satisfying the
      Payment Order in question.

      A given Payment Order can be satisfied at most once.  A vacated
      Payment Order cannot be satisfied.

      A given transfer may be used for the purpose of satisfying at
      most one Payment Order.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1735 be amended to read:

      The Chancellor is the Executor of the Bank.  As soon as possible
      after a Payment Order is executed for which the Bank is the
      payor, the Chancellor shall either (as the Bank's Executor)
      satisfy the Payment Order, or dispute it by making a COE or CFJ.
      However, the Chancellor need not do so if another Player makes
      such a COE or CFJ first.

      If the Chancellor executes a transfer from the Bank for any
      reason other than to satisfy a Payment Order (except when
      specifically required by the Rules to execute a transfer), e
      commits the Class A Crime of Misappropriation, and upon
      conviction of this Crime shall be removed from Office.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1817 be amended to read:

      A Recordkeepor is required to record all valid transfers
      executed by the Executor of the owner of the units of Currency
      to be transferred (or, with respect to any entity which lacks an
      Executor, by any other person empowered by the Rules to execute
      transfers on the behalf of such entities), except for those
      transfers which would result in an entity possessing a negative
      quantity of Currency. Transfers shall be noted on the
      Recordkeepor's records in the order in which they are received
      by the Recordkeepor.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1818 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1739 be amended, by replacing the
paragraph reading

      Units of Currency are assigned to an entity by requiring a
      Transfer Order for those Units of Currency from the entity in
      Probate to that Entity.

with one reading

      Units of Currency are assigned to an entity by requiring the
      execution of a transfer of those Units of Currency from the
      entity in Probate to that Entity.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1820 be amended to read:

      Each Recordkeepor shall maintain a record of all transfers
      executed which specify the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor, for at least four weeks after their execution.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1823 be amended to read:

      If a Player is required to execute two or more Payment Orders,
      all of which name the same Payor, Payee, and Currency, that
      Player may elect to instead execute one Payment Order naming
      that Payor, Payee and Currency, and for an amount equal to the
      sum of all such Payment Orders required.  Doing so satisfies by
      substitution the requirement to execute all such Payment Orders.

      This Rule may not be applied with respect to any Payment Order
      required consequent to the vacation or stay of another Payment
      Order.

      Payment Orders to be executed for the purpose of paying for
      Voting upon Proposals may not be combined by this Rule with
      Payment Orders executed for any other purpose.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1757 be amended to read:

      (a) The Trustee of an entity in Probate is empowered to execute
          on behalf of that entity whatever transfers are necessary to
          implement eir Plan for the disposition of that entity's
          Estate, as if e were that entity's Executor.  The Trustee
          may also execute and vacate Payment Orders when necessary to
          implement the Plan for the disposition of the Estate.

      (b) The Trustee may exercise the above powers only when
          implementing a Plan for the disposition of the Estate of the
          entity in Probate of which e is the Trustee.

      (c) The Trustee of an entity in Probate ceases to be Trustee
          when:
        (1) e announces in the Public Forum that e resigns as Trustee;
        (2) e ceases to be a Player;
        (3) the entity of which e is Trustee ceases to be in Probate;
            or
        (4) the Notary announces that e has been removed as Trustee.

      (d) An entity in Probate ceases to be in Probate when its
          Trustee announces the completion of the implementation of a
          Plan for the disposition of the Estate of that entity.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1596 be amended to read:

      A Payment Order is an Order requiring an entity (the payor) to
      execute a transfer transferring units of a Currency from itself
      to some other entity (the payee).  A Payment Order specifies
      exactly one source entity, exactly one destination entity,
      exactly one Currency, and a number of units of that Currency
      which is a positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1598 be amended to read:

      (a) A transfer is valid if:
        (1) the entity executing it is the Executor of the entity from
            which the transfer is to be made, or if that entity has no
            Executor, such other Player as is authorized to execute
            transfers on behalf of that entity;
        (2) the transfer is denominated in exactly one Currency;
        (3) the amount transferred is a positive multiple of that
            Currency's MUQ;
        (4) the entity from which the transfer is to be made, prior to
            that transfer, possesses at least that many units of that
            Currency; and
        (5) if the transfer purports to be executed to satisfy a
            particular Payment, that Payment Order exists and is
            capable of being satisfied by that transfer.

      (b) A transfer is executed by submitting a Transfer Notice to
          the Recordkeepor of the Currency in which it is denominated;
          this Notice shall set forth:
        (1) the entity from which the transfer is being made;
        (2) the entity to which the transfer is being made;
        (3) the Currency involved;
        (4) the number of units of Currency being transferred; and
        (5) the purpose of the transfer, if specification of the
            purpose of the transfer is necessary to meet with the
            requirements of another Rule.

Could someone explain my status now, please? Am I safe until the
appeal is Judged? Or do I pay now and hope for redress later? If
the Appeal goes against me, how long do I have before I become liable
for PI?
