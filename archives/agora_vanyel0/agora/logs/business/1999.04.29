If it is possible for me to do so, I remove this Proposal from the Queue.

Ack.

Well, actually my main concern is the "print media" clause.  Have there been
CFJs to allow electronic media, such as mailing lists, to count as print media?
(I realize there's plenty of game custom to support the view, since Agora
likely has never been non-electronic, but it would be nice for the Rules to
reflect that.)

My pre-proto version of this didn't mention the Public Forum at all, but added
an "electronic media" clause.  Unfortunately, it didn't have the right AI
either.

There's nothing remarkable about it.  All one has to do is hit the right keys
at the right time and the instrument plays itself.

I take it you are maintaining that A Separation of Powers was not
adopted? Because if it was, as I noted in my voting message, then
I am not a voting entity and could not have cast the above votes.

Rule 1786/0 (Power=1)
Proposal Passed by the Narrowest of Margins

      A Proposal is considered to have passed by the narrowest of
      margins when all of the following conditions are true:

      1) The Proposal has met the requirements established by other
         Rules to be considered passed.
      2) If there had been 1 (one) less FOR vote (out of the total
         number of FOR votes in the final tally) on this proposal,
         it would not have passed or not met Quorum -- or both.
      3) There must have been at least 1 (one) AGAINST vote in the
         final tally.

      As soon as possible after a Proposal has been determined to
      have passed by the narrowest of margins, the Assessor shall pay
      out to that Proposal's Proposer an award of 3 (three) Voting
      Tokens in addition to any other award that Player might also
      receive for the passing of that Proposal.

I believe my proposal "Keep a duty to vote" P3854, passed by the 
narrowest of margins.  If it is possible for me to do so, I determine 
P3854 to have passed by the narrowest of margins.

Mr. Assessor unless there is good reason to suggest that my beliefs, 
as stated above, are wrong I would like my 3 VTs.

Peekee

I claim the above is in error in that Vlad was a legislator and thus
ineligible to vote on these.  I note that the issues which have been
raised on a-d regarding the effectiveness of Steve's summary adoptions
apply only to the proposal repealing summary adoption, and *not* to
A Separation of Powers, which had been submitted previously.  The
"clear indication" which has been much debated recently applies only
to the submission of Proposals and not to Adoption Without Objection.

Thus, I believe that both 3854 and 3855 failed quorum.

Oops. I guess I wasn't paying attention. You are right. So those results
should be:

   3854 Peekee         1 Keep a Duty to Vote               PASSES  3-1-0-1
   3855 Vlad           1 Cleaning up the Grand Agoran...   FAILS   2-0-0-3
   3856 Oerjan         1 April Fool                        FAILS   2-0-0-5
   3857 Gen Chaos      1 Taxes, revisited                  PASSES  4-0-0-2

As a result, I vacate the following POs:

  Ass#  Payor          Payee      Amt  Currency  Reason
------  -----          -----      ---  --------  ------
apn047  Bank           Vlad         2  P-Notes   R833, P3855
avt160  Vlad           Bank       3.0  VTs       Voting

and I amend avt161 to:

avt161  Bank           Blob       0.6  VTs       Commission (P3854-57)

Since this changes the result for 3854, it did not pass "by the Narrowest 
of Margins", so I'm afraid Peekee does not get his 3 VTs. Sorry to get 
your hopes up Peekee.

I admit the error. I have already posted a correction, in response to
Vlad's message on the same problem.

> Thus, I believe that both 3854 and 3855 failed quorum.

Neither failed Quorum. Quorum for these proposals was four (harvel and
Beefurabi both registered shortly afterwards, and you were denied voting
privileges at the time).

P3855 did fail, however, because it failed to receive 3 votes FOR (R955).
P3854 still passed (although ironically, only because harvel voted against
it).
