      "If two more of the 4 currently Rebellious Players (Harlequin,
       Sherlock, Morendil and Time Agent) will agree to become Abiding,
       so pushing the prospect of another Revolt further into the
       distance, then I will use my Speaker's Right to Call Elections
       to free up some of the Offices held by the Threat, namely,
       Scorekeepor, Commander-in-Chief and Archivist.  Bearing in mind
       that Crito will soon be Elected Accountor (General Chaos is not
       really contesting the Election), this will reduce the number of
       Offices held by the Threat from 10 to 6, basically restoring
       the political balance."

      Sherlock becomes Abiding.

      Chuck becomes Rebellious.

3/22  Sherlock becomes Rebellious.

3/24  Blob becomes Rebellious.


OTHER
-----

3/27  elJefe analyzes the latest results of Proposal 3710's adoption,
        if it was adopted:  "Threat Trombones" was raised to Power=4,
        so Threat Trombone #5 raised the Monument Rule to Power=7
        (regardless of Rules 1692 and 1322 attempting to prevent it
        from doing so).  Rule 1322 then prevents Rule 1692 from
        reducing the Monument Rule to Power=4, and prevents Chuck's
        Counter-Scam (involving instruments of at most Power=5) from
        repealing it.

This Week with R-O-M

I show 342 rules in the Current Rule set.  The random number generator spit out
the following numbers:

 58 = Rule 1728 Actions Without Objection
243 = Rule 1730 Delayed Transfer Orders
 88 = Rule 1065 Discourages Too Many Proposals
316 = Rule 1533 Application to Create an Organization
210 = Rule 1706 Locations

Let's get ambitious.  Chuck has already proposed the repeal of 1065, so I will
select 1706 this week and use the "consistency" powers of the R-O-M rule to
offer up the chance for Players to completely eliminate the Agoraverse.

Acting as Executor and on behalf of the Repeal-O-Matic, I hereby submit the
following proposal and transfer order:

PROPOSAL: Repeal Rule 1706 (Locations)
                    This Proposal shall have an AI = 1
                    Rule 1706 is hereby Repealed.

Amend R869 by deleting the text:

      When a Player registers, eir Location is the Welcoming Center.

Amend R1016 by replacing the text:

      An Off Hold Player becomes On Hold when e Moves to the Stasis
      Chamber.

      An On Hold Player becomes Off Hold when e Moves from the Stasis
      Chamber.  E may not do so until at least 96 hours after e last
      went On Hold.

      An Off Hold Player becomes On Hold when e announces in the Public
      Forum that e goes On Hold.

      An On Hold Player becomes Off Hold when e announces in the Public
      Forum that e comes Off Hold.  E may not do so until at least 96 hours
      after e last went On Hold.

Amend R1664 by replacing the text:

                                             A Player whose Location
      is the Beer Hall can switch from Abiding to Rebellious or from
      Rebellious to Abiding by sending a message to the Public Forum
      saying e does change so. 

with the text:

      A Player can switch from Abiding to Rebellious or from
      Rebellious to Abiding by sending a message to the Public Forum

Repeal Rule 1707.
Repeal Rule 1708.
Repeal Rule 1709.
Repeal Rule 1710.

==================End Proposal

I also transfer one P-Note from the R-O-M to the Bank to raise the priority of
this proposal to 1.

Apparently my appeal of CFJ 1089 did not go to the PF...

I appeal the Judgement of CFJ 1089. The Board may as well look at
both of these.

I hereby vote as follows on the above Proposals:

 3  3  3  3  3
 7  7  7  7  7
 2  2  2  2  2
 0  1  2  3  4

 F  F  A  *  *

Note: I don't much like P3722. 3 VTs seems an outrageously high
reward simply for fulfilling ones duties as a Trustee. I don't think
any reward is especially appropriate, but certainly not one this
generous.

H. Promotor Crito,

I hereby submit the following Proposal, paying 2 P-Notes to the Bank
to increase its Priority to 2.

####
Proposal
Tabula Rasa

[Comment: too many P-Notes, too many Indulgences, too many VTs. Time
to start again, again.]

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "Tabula Rasa", be created
with the following text:

      Upon the creation of this Rule, all Voting Tokens, Proposal
      Notes and Indulgences are destroyed. Further, all obligations
      on the Chancellor to transfer Currency incurred under the
      authority of Rule 1754 (Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank) are
      cancelled. Further, all unsatisfied Payment Orders naming any
      Player as Payor are vacated.

      Within three days after the creation of this Rule, the
      Chancellor shall pay out to each Player seven Voting Tokens
      and 1 Proposal Note.

[Comment: basically, besides destroying all Currencies (and then
giving a limited amount back), this also cancels nearly all POs,
leaving only Officer Salaries alone. The Proposal gives seven
VTs back, rather than, say, five, because under the new billing
system, Players will have to pay for their votes on the batch of
Proposals containing this one after this Proposal is adopted, which
is to say after nearly all VTs have been destroyed. If we're going to
destroy all Indulgences, it's only fair to cancel all Blots.]

Be it further resolved that R1754 (Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank)
be repealed.

[Comment: As Scott points out, after Omnibus Reform, this Rule is
superfluous, since Players can vacate inadvertent transfers. So why
keep the reference to R1754 in the provision above if the Rule is
being repealed? Because I'm not sure that the repeal of the Rule
would result in the cancellation of obligations already incurred
under its authority before its repeal.]

Be it further resolved that R1465 (Champion's Reward) be amended
by replacing the text "ten Voting Tokens" with the text "four
Voting Tokens".

[Comment: it's been clear for quite a while that this reward
is too generous.]

Be it further resolved that R1654 (Rewards for Doctors of Nomic
History) be repealed.

[Comment: we could lower the reward as in R1465, but the Rule has
hardly been effective in encouraging submissions for the Degree of
D.N.Hist, has it?]
