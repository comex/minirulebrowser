Proto:  Plots (v2.0)


[Part One:  Replace Locations with Plots]

All Locations are destroyed.

Amend Rule 1706 to read:

     Plots are a Currency.  Their MUQ is 1.  Their Recordkeepor is the
     Cartographor.  Their Mintor is the Bank.

Repeal Rule 1707.

Amend Rule 1708 to read:

     Two Plots may be Adjacent to each other.  No Plot is Adjacent to
     itself.

Repeal Rule 1709.

[Rule 1710 will be amended later.]

Create a Rule titled "Naming Plots" with this text:

     Each Plot has a unique name.  A Transfer Order or Payment Order
     for Plots cannot be executed if it fails to specify which Plots are
     referred to, or if its execution would cause an entity to possess a
     negative number of Plots.

     A Plot's owner may change its name Without Objection.

One hundred Plots are created in the Bank's possession, with the names "Area
XY", where X and Y are each digits ranging from 0 to 9.  "Area XY" is Adjacent
to "Area MN" (where X, Y, M, and N are each digits ranging from 0 to 9) iff
one of the following conditions is true:
  X = M and Y-N = 1 (mod 10)
  X = M and N-Y = 1 (mod 10)
  X-M = 1 (mod 10) and Y = N
  M-X = 1 (mod 10) and Y = N

[The Cartographor is unofficially encouraged to use this or similar text -
 noting exceptions, if any - as shorthand to represent these Adjacencies.]

Create a Rule entitled "Winning by Ownership" with this text:

     Being the only Player to own Plots is a Winning Condition known as
     a Win by Ownership.  When a Player Wins in this way, all Plots Owned
     by the Winner become Owned by the Bank.


[Part Two:  Define Mules and Energy]

Create a Rule entitled "Mules" with this text:

     Mules are a Currency.  Their MUQ is 1.  Their Recordkeepor is the
     Cartographor.  Their Mintor is the Bank.

     A Mule's owner may transfer that Mule to any Plot e owns, or vice
     versa, by executing a Transfer Order accordingly; but e may not
     transfer a Mule to a Plot already possessing one.

Create a Rule entitled "Energy" with this text:

     Energy is a currency.  Its MUQ is 1.  Its Recordkeepor is the
     Cartographor.  Its Mintor is the Bank.

100 Mules and 10000 units of Energy are created in the Bank's possession.

Amend Rule 1677 to read:

     Upon the start of a Player's Grace Period, the Registrar shall
     pay out to that Player an award of 5 Voting Tokens, 5 P-Notes,
     5 Mules, and 15 units of Energy.

Amend Rule 1701 by removing this paragraph:

     Whenever there exists a Player who has never before possessed
     any P-Notes, the Promotor shall pay out 5 P-Notes to that Player.

Each current Player gains 5 Mules and 15 units of Energy.


[Part Three:  Make Mules useful]

Create a Rule entitled "Working Mules" with this text:

     All Mules are either Idle or Working.  All Mules are initially Idle.

     An Idle Mule becomes Working when its owner specifies that Mule and a
     type of Work to the Cartographor, and pays the price of that type of
     Working Mule to the Bank.

     A Working Mule becomes Idle when its owner specifies that Mule to the
     Cartographor.  For each Working Mule that becomes Idle, the Cartographor
     shall pay out half its price (rounded down) to its owner.

     Only Mules possessed by Plots may be Working.  Working Mules which cease
     to be possessed by Plots become Idle automatically.

Create a rule titled "Mule Upkeep" with this text:

     An owner's monthly upkeep on eir Working Mule is equal to 2 units of
     Energy for eir first Working Mule of each type, plus 1 unit of Energy
     for each of eir additional Working Mules, unless otherwise specified.

     If an owner does not pay the upkeep on all of eir Structures to the
     Bank within one week of the beginning of the month, then all of eir
     Working Mules are destroyed (without becoming Idle first).

Create a rule titled "Productive Mules" reading:

     At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall pay
     out each Working Mule's Production to its owner (if its Production
     is greater than zero).

     Pastors have no Production.  However, each Pastor is considered
     to be two players for the purpose of randomly allocating Indulgences,
     and any Indulgence that would otherwise be given to a Pastor is instead
     given to its owner.

Create a Rule entitled "Types of Working Mules" with this text:

     A type of Working Mule exists only if the Rules explicitly define it.

     The following types of Working Mule exist, with the specified prices
     and Productions, unless otherwise specified:

       * Farmers, 4 units of Energy, 5 VTs
       * Ranchers, 4 units of Energy, 1 P-Note
       * Miners, 4 units of Energy, 1 unit of Energy
       * Pastors, 4 units of Energy, none

Create a new Rule titled "Interacting Mules" and this text:

     Two Mules are Adjacent if and only if they are possessed by Adjacent
     Plots.

     A Farmer's Production is increased by 0.5 VT for each Pastor to which it
     is Adjacent, and decreased by 0.5 VT for each Rancher or Miner to which
     it is Adjacent.

     A Rancher's Production is increased by 1 P-Note for every 2 Pastors
     to which it is Adjacent, and decreased by 1 P-Note for every 2 Farmers
     or Miners to which it is Adjacent.

     A Miner's Production is not affected by Adjacency.


[Part Four:  Amend the Rule defining the Cartographor and eir duties]

Amend Rule 1710 to read:

     There is an Office of Cartographor. The Cartographor recieves a 
     salary equal to 2 times the Basic Officer Salary.

     At least once each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall post a 
     Report to the Public Forum containing the following information:

       * the name, ownership, and Adjacency of all Plots
       * the ownership and type (if any) of all Mules
       * the ownership of all units of Energy
       * all Transfer Orders and Payment Orders specifying Plots, Mules,
           or units of Energy since the last Report
       * any changes in these facts since the last Report


[Part Five:  Authorship]

Harlequin, Blob, and Antimatter become Authors of each Rule created or
amended earlier in this Proposal.


[Part Six:  Clean up other references to Locations]

Amend Rule 869 by removing the following paragraph:

     When a Player registers, eir Location is the Welcoming Center.

Amend Rule 1016 to read:

     At any time, each Player shall either be On Hold or Off Hold.
     This status shall not be changed except as specified in the
     Rules.

     When a Player registers (or reregisters), e is Off Hold.

     An Off Hold Player becomes On Hold when e says so in the Public
     Forum.

     An On Hold Player becomes Off Hold when e says so in the Public
     Forum; however, any attempt to do so within 96 hours after e last
     went On Hold is ineffective.

Amend Rule 1664 by removing the text "whose Location is the Beer Hall".

Amend Rule 1367 by adding this paragraph:

     "Granting a Degree" and "awarding a Degree" are synonymous.  A
     Player who has been awarded a Degree possesses that Degree.

Repeal Rule 1711.

     Bank within one week of the beginning of the month, then all of eir
     Working Mules are destroyed (without becoming Idle first).

Create a rule titled "Productive Mules" reading:

     At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall pay
     out each Working Mule's Production to its owner (if its Production
     is greater than zero).

     Pastors have no Production.  However, each Pastor is considered
     to be two players for the purpose of randomly allocating Indulgences,
     and any Indulgence that would otherwise be given to a Pastor is instead
     given to its owner.

Create a Rule entitled "Types of Working Mules" with this text:

     A type of Working Mule exists only if the Rules explicitly define it.

     The following types of Working Mule exist, with the specified prices
     and Productions, unless otherwise specified:

       * Farmers, 4 units of Energy, 5 VTs
       * Ranchers, 4 units of Energy, 1 P-Note
       * Miners, 4 units of Energy, 1 unit of Energy
       * Pastors, 4 units of Energy, none

Create a new Rule titled "Interacting Mules" and this text:

     Two Mules are Adjacent if and only if they are possessed by Adjacent
     Plots.

     A Farmer's Production is increased by 0.5 VT for each Pastor to which it
     is Adjacent, and decreased by 0.5 VT for each Rancher or Miner to which
     it is Adjacent.

     A Rancher's Production is increased by 1 P-Note for every 2 Pastors
     to which it is Adjacent, and decreased by 1 P-Note for every 2 Farmers
     or Miners to which it is Adjacent.

     A Miner's Production is not affected by Adjacency.


[Part Four:  Amend the Rule defining the Cartographor and eir duties]

Amend Rule 1710 to read:

     There is an Office of Cartographor. The Cartographor recieves a 
     salary equal to 2 times the Basic Officer Salary.

     At least once each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall post a 
     Report to the Public Forum containing the following information:

       * the name, ownership, and Adjacency of all Plots
       * the ownership and type (if any) of all Mules
       * the ownership of all units of Energy
       * all Transfer Orders and Payment Orders specifying Plots, Mules,
           or units of Energy since the last Report
       * any changes in these facts since the last Report


[Part Five:  Authorship]

Harlequin, Blob, and Antimatter become Authors of each Rule created or
amended earlier in this Proposal.


[Part Six:  Clean up other references to Locations]

Amend Rule 869 by removing the following paragraph:

     When a Player registers, eir Location is the Welcoming Center.

Amend Rule 1016 to read:

     At any time, each Player shall either be On Hold or Off Hold.
     This status shall not be changed except as specified in the
     Rules.

     When a Player registers (or reregisters), e is Off Hold.

     An Off Hold Player becomes On Hold when e says so in the Public
     Forum.

     An On Hold Player becomes Off Hold when e says so in the Public
     Forum; however, any attempt to do so within 96 hours after e last
     went On Hold is ineffective.

Amend Rule 1664 by removing the text "whose Location is the Beer Hall".

Amend Rule 1367 by adding this paragraph:

     "Granting a Degree" and "awarding a Degree" are synonymous.  A
     Player who has been awarded a Degree possesses that Degree.

Repeal Rule 1711.

[Actually, there is one substantive change between v1.6 and this
 version:  the proto-Rule currently named "Interacting Mules" specifies
 different interactions than before.  Does anyone think it throws off the
 balance to have Farmers and Ranchers interfere with each other?]


Proto:  Plots (v2.1)


[Part One:  Replace Locations with Plots]

All Locations are destroyed.

Amend Rule 1706 to read:

     Plots are a Currency.  Their MUQ is 1.  Their Recordkeepor is the
     Cartographor.  Their Mintor is the Bank.

Repeal Rule 1707.

Amend Rule 1708 to read:

     Two Plots may be Adjacent to each other.  No Plot is Adjacent to
     itself.

Repeal Rule 1709.

[Rule 1710 will be amended later.]

Create a Rule titled "Naming Plots" with this text:

     Each Plot has a unique name.  A Transfer Order or Payment Order
     for Plots cannot be executed if it fails to specify which Plots are
     referred to, or if its execution would cause an entity to possess a
     negative number of Plots.

     A Plot's owner may change its name Without Objection.

One hundred Plots are created in the Bank's possession, with the names "Area
XY", where X and Y are each digits ranging from 0 to 9.  "Area XY" is Adjacent
to "Area MN" (where X, Y, M, and N are each digits ranging from 0 to 9) iff
one of the following conditions is true:
  X = M and Y-N = 1 (mod 10)
  X = M and N-Y = 1 (mod 10)
  X-M = 1 (mod 10) and Y = N
  M-X = 1 (mod 10) and Y = N

[The Cartographor is unofficially encouraged to use this or similar text -
 noting exceptions, if any - as shorthand to represent these Adjacencies.]

Create a Rule entitled "Winning by Ownership" with this text:

     Being the only Player to own Plots is a Winning Condition known as
     a Win by Ownership.  When a Player Wins in this way, all Plots Owned
     by the Winner become Owned by the Bank.


[Part Two:  Define Mules and Energy]

Create a Rule entitled "Mules" with this text:

     Mules are a Currency.  Their MUQ is 1.  Their Recordkeepor is the
     Cartographor.  Their Mintor is the Bank.

     A Mule's owner may transfer that Mule to any Plot e owns, or vice
     versa, by executing a Transfer Order accordingly; but e may not
     transfer a Mule to a Plot already possessing one.

Create a Rule entitled "Ergs" with this text:

     Ergs are a currency.  Their MUQ is 1.  Their Recordkeepor is the
     Cartographor.  Their Mintor is the Bank.

100 Mules and 10,000 Ergs are created in the Bank's possession.

Amend Rule 1677 to read:

     Upon the start of a Player's Grace Period, the Registrar shall
     pay out to that Player an award of 5 Voting Tokens, 5 P-Notes,
     5 Mules, and 15 Ergs.

Amend Rule 1701 by removing this paragraph:

     Whenever there exists a Player who has never before possessed
     any P-Notes, the Promotor shall pay out 5 P-Notes to that Player.

As soon as possible after the adoption of this Proposal, the Assessor
shall pay out 5 Mules and 15 Ergs to each Player.


[Part Three:  Make Mules useful]

Create a Rule entitled "Working Mules" with this text:

     All Mules are either Idle or Working.  All Mules are initially Idle.

     An Idle Mule becomes Working when its owner specifies that Mule and a
     type of Work to the Cartographor, and pays the price of that type of
     Working Mule to the Bank.

     A Working Mule becomes Idle when its owner specifies that Mule to the
     Cartographor.  For each Working Mule that becomes Idle, the Cartographor
     shall pay out half its price (rounded down) to its owner.

     Only Mules possessed by Plots may be Working.  Working Mules which cease
     to be possessed by Plots become Idle automatically.

Create a rule titled "Mule Upkeep" with this text:

     An owner's monthly upkeep on eir Working Mule is equal to 2 Ergs for eir
     first Working Mule of each type, plus 1 Erg for each of eir additional
     Working Mules, unless otherwise specified.

     If an owner does not pay the upkeep on all of eir Structures to the
     Bank within one week of the beginning of the month, then all of eir
     Working Mules are destroyed (without becoming Idle first).

Create a rule titled "Productive Mules" reading:

     At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall pay
     out each Working Mule's Production to its owner (if its Production
     is greater than zero).

     Pastors have no Production.  However, each Pastor is considered
     to be two players for the purpose of randomly allocating Indulgences,
     and any Indulgence that would otherwise be given to a Pastor is instead
     given to its owner.

Create a Rule entitled "Types of Working Mules" with this text:

     A type of Working Mule exists only if the Rules explicitly define it.

     The following types of Working Mule exist, with the specified prices
     and Productions, unless otherwise specified:

       * Farmers      4 Ergs     5 VTs
       * Ranchers     4 Ergs     1 P-Note
       * Miners       4 Ergs     1 Erg
       * Pastors      4 Ergs     none

Create a new Rule titled "Interacting Mules" and this text:

     Two Mules are Adjacent if and only if they are possessed by Adjacent
     Plots.

     A Farmer's Production is increased by 0.5 VT for each Pastor to which it
     is Adjacent, and decreased by 0.5 VT for each Rancher or Miner to which
     it is Adjacent.

     A Rancher's Production is increased by 1 P-Note for every 2 Pastors
     to which it is Adjacent, and decreased by 1 P-Note for every 2 Farmers
     or Miners to which it is Adjacent.

     A Miner's Production is not affected by Adjacency.


[Part Four:  Amend the Rule defining the Cartographor and eir duties]

Amend Rule 1710 to read:

     There is an Office of Cartographor. The Cartographor recieves a 
     salary equal to 2 times the Basic Officer Salary.

     At least once each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall post a 
     Report to the Public Forum containing the following information:

       * the name, ownership, and Adjacency of all Plots
       * the ownership and type (if any) of all Mules
       * the ownership of all Ergs
       * all Transfer Orders and Payment Orders specifying Plots, Mules,
           or Ergs since the last Report
       * any changes in these facts since the last Report


[Part Five:  Authorship]

Harlequin, Blob, and Antimatter become Authors of each Rule created or
amended earlier in this Proposal.


[Part Six:  Clean up other references to Locations]

Amend Rule 869 by removing the following paragraph:

     When a Player registers, eir Location is the Welcoming Center.

Amend Rule 1016 to read:

     At any time, each Player shall either be On Hold or Off Hold.
     This status shall not be changed except as specified in the
     Rules.

     When a Player registers (or reregisters), e is Off Hold.

     An Off Hold Player becomes On Hold when e says so in the Public
     Forum.

     An On Hold Player becomes Off Hold when e says so in the Public
     Forum; however, any attempt to do so within 96 hours after e last
     went On Hold is ineffective.

Amend Rule 1664 by removing the text "whose Location is the Beer Hall".

Amend Rule 1367 by adding this paragraph:

     "Granting a Degree" and "awarding a Degree" are synonymous.  A
     Player who has been awarded a Degree possesses that Degree.

Repeal Rule 1711.
