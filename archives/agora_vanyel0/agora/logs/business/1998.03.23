H. Assessor,

I hereby retract my votes on P3708, 3711 and 3712.

Thanks, Kolja A.

P.S. to Ørjan: While I did vote for the abolition of 113 to bring
some life into the ROM proposal votes and to encourage people to
actively protect rules they want to keep, this was only a side effect
of my votes on P3711 and 3712 (and a futile one, at that, as these
will fail quorum anyway). The main reason was that having voted on
these and some other proposals I will get the score gain for voting on
more than three proposals in a given week. But I can get this score
gain for free by voting first, and then retracting the votes later. So
my retraction was planned all the time, and is not a reaction to your
huff practice.

I hereby transfer 2 VTs and 2 Indulgences to the Bank in order
to satisfy the above POs.  I also apologize to the Agoran
community for my delay in publishing the Ruleset.

Also, I note that I have been lax in my FENICS dues this
month.  I hereby transfer 1 Indulgence to FENICS.

The Accountor has recorded the Payment Orders arising due to the
