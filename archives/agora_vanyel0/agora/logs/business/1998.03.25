I claim that this is in error, as I have at this time not been
provided with a complete accounting of the various Currencies held
by the Player for whom I am a Trustee by all relevant Recordkeepors.

H. Scorekeepor:

As a result of the above Blots, each of the following Players lose 4 points:

    Morendil, Sherlock, Blob, Time Agent, Murphy.


I note that this points out a flaw in the scoring Rule.  Even though the Blots
against Sherlock have been vacated, e has no recourse for recovering the points
lost.  We should probably add the provision that 2 points are gained for each
Blot vacated.

This Week with R-O-M

I counted 341 Rules in the current Ruleset.  Here are the random numbers
generated this week:

269 = Rule 1663 "Win by Proposals"
150 = Rule  698 "Always an Eligible Judge"
201 = Rule 1051 "The Office of the Rulekeepor"
 14 = Rule 1688 "Power"
156 = Rule  217 "Judgements Must Accord with the Rules"

Well, I keep forgetting to propose my amendment to 1663 to eliminate the 0-0-0
loophole, but what the heck, let's see if people would just rather eliminate it
entirely.

So, acting on behalf of and as Executor of the Repeal-O-Matic, I hereby submit
the following proposal:

          PROPOSAL: Repeal Rule 1663 (Win by Proposals)
                    This Proposal shall have an AI = 1
                    Rule 1663 is hereby Repealed.

and I transfer one P-Note from the R-O-M to the Bank to increase the priority
of this proposal to one.
