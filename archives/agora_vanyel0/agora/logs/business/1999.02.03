According to my Assessor's records, P3829 already has three votes FOR,
from you, Crito and Gen Chaos. I doubt anyone is going to vote against,
so it is pretty much destined to pass. Rather than waste another 1.2 VTs
on it, which doesn't help either of us, I will split the voting cost with
you.

H Accountor, I transfer 0.6 VTs to Steve.

Now we have each spent 1.8 VTs on these two proposals. That seems fair. 
Are we still friends?

  This message contains exactly one Proposal.  The Proposal begins
  immediately after the line marked "**START PROPOSAL" and ends at the
  end of the message.
  
  The following Proposal is to be titled "Summary Adoption" and is to
have Adoption Index 3.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it therefore resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

The Proposer of any Proposal may cause it to be Adopted Without
Objection, but only if the Proposal has not yet been distributed.

A Proposal Adopted Without Objection is Adopted at the time its
Proposer changes its status to Adopted in accordance with the
procedure for performing changes Without Objection, but only if at
that time that Proposal has not yet been distributed.

When a Proposal is Adopted Without Objection, it is removed from the
Queue.

This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would prevent a
Proposal from being Adopted Without Objection, and over any Rule which
would prevent a Proposal Adopted Without Objection from being removed
from the Proposal Queue.

Unless there is a new interpretation I missed, R910
