Erg.  That should be, "I decline to be Speaker-Elect".  Which I do.

I am reasonably convinced that CFJ 1045 is not a "certain case" in the
sense used by Rule 1736, and that Morendil's Injunctions are therefor
illegally made.  I therefore call for the Appeal of all four, and note
that my call is adequate in itself to force an Appeal of the first
three of them by virtue of being named in them.

  Judged TRUE by Morendil, 30 Sep 1997 17:51:10 +0100

============================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

In CFJ 1045, I find the Statement to be TRUE.

I am in essential agreement with the Caller that Rule 1563 provides
more than adequate justification for Dismissing the named CFJs, in
spite of some arduous wording which made it briefly tempting - given
the rewards of returning a Judgement on, rather than Dismiss, these
CFJs - to wriggle my way out of it.


But wait, there is more.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the sum total of
Payment Orders in Indulgences naming that Player as Payor that they
have thus far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the sum total of Payment
Orders in Voting Tokens naming that Player as Payor that they have
thus far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Proposal Notes equal to the sum total of
Payment Orders in Indulgences naming that Player as Payor that they
have thus far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to the Registrar, requiring em to issue, for each Player, a
Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, that Player as Payee, for an
amount of 5 VTs. (So we can Vote on Proposals, y'know...)

The above facially satisfy provisions i) through iv) of Rule 663
pertaining to Injunctions; it is my belief that they also satisfy v), 
though that requires us to examine any Rule relevant thereto. I
find one, Rule 1736 itself, which states

      The Rules may require, in certain cases, that a Judge issue an
      Injunction ordering the execution of a Payment Order.  If the
      Payment Order required by such an Injunction is executed, and
      the Injunction itself later set aside, the Player who executed
      the required Payment Order shall, as soon as possible after the
      Injunction was set aside, vacate that Payment Order.

This merely states that Rules are permitted to require Judges to
issue Injuctions under certain circumstances; it is as far as I can
see no bar to a Judge taking it upon emself to issue any legal
Injuction. No prohibition of any kind in fact obtains with respect
to issuing Injuctions defined in 1736/1737; the procedure for issuing
an Injunction is well delineated, and followed to a T in this
Judgement; issuing an Injunctions in the present circumstances is 
therefore possible and unprohibited, which I submit is all that 'in a 
manner consistent with the Rules' requires.

Lastly, a note as to intent - obviously, this loophole can be used
for massive personal gain (well, once the status of Currencies has
been determined), and just as obviously it will be extremely tempting
for other Players assigned to Judge CFJs to take advantage of it for
the same reasons. It could also be used to summarily deregister 
anyone from the Game by assigning them 31 Blots.

There is no limit to how far this could be abused; if everyone jumps
on that bandwagon, all we will do is spoil the game absolutely.
Better we should fix that loophole, and quick, and refrain from
doing anything else about it for the sake of preserving the game's
fun.

I think the above is even-handed enough that Players (especially
Justices or Judges with CFJs currently assigned to em) will see their
own interest in letting it stand at that.

(And remember, you ain't seen nothing yet.)

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:


Relevant Rules: 1563

Rule 1563/1 (Power=1)
Statement of a CFJ

      In order to be Judged, a Call for Judgement must contain a
      single clearly-labeled Statement which must be able to be
      determined by the means of logical reasoning, with the
      presumption of perfect knowledge, to be either TRUE or FALSE.
      Statements which are inherently contradictory or which are
      vacuous are not acceptable, and a CFJ containing such a
      Statement shall not be Judged.

      If a Call for Judgement does not contain a Statement of the sort
      required by this Rule, its Judge is required to dismiss the CFJ,
      as described elsewhere.

      It is permitted for a Call for Judgement to contain Arguments,
      Evidence, or other material placed there at the Caller's
      discretion.  However, the Judge is not required to take notice
      of any part of the CFJ other than the Statement in formulating
      eir Judgement.

Before I begin arguing, I'd like to say that when I refer to "the
statement", I refer to the statement "This statement is TRUE.", and when I
refer to "the CFJ", I'm referring to the CFJ I am submitting.  I'm keeping
this consistancy so that it's clear what I am talking about.

The statement "This statement is TRUE." cannot be determined to be either
TRUE or FALSE by means of logical reasoning.

If the statement is TRUE, then it follows that the statement is TRUE, and
there's no contradiction.  If the statement is FALSE, then it follows that
the statement is FALSE, and there's no contradiction.  Therefore, the
statement is both TRUE and FALSE and is not either TRUE or FALSE.

The statement is also vacuous, and is therefore not acceptable.

vacuous (v*k*yí-es) adjective
1.	Devoid of matter; empty.
2.	a. Lacking intelligence; stupid. b. Devoid of substance or meaning;
inane: a vacuous comment. c. Devoid of expression; vacant: "The narrow,
swinelike eyes were open, no more vacuous in death than they had been in
life" (Nicholas Proffitt).
3.	Lacking serious purpose or occupation; idle. See synonyms at EMPTY.
[From Latin vacuus, empty. See VACUUM.]
- vac*uously adverb
- vac*uousness noun

definitions 2b, 2c, and 3 all support the statement being vacuous.
definition 1 would imply an empty statement, like a null set, but then
there would be no statement to be vacuous, so definition 1 does not apply.
definition 2a is a matter of taste, so it does not apply.

The statement has not substance or meaning in game terms or in terms of
anything other than the statement.

I'd like to also note that this CFJ must be judged TRUE if it is determined
by the judge that the statement cannot be judged TRUE or FALSE by logical
reasoning or the statement is vacuous.  Either one of those being TRUE (or
both being true) makes this CFJ true.

Scott, read the Judgement again.  I think you'll find there are
more than 4 Injunctions there.

I hereby call for the appeal of all Injunctions issued with
the Judgement of CFJ 1045.

Well, we might as well get things underway. I call for the Appeal
of all the Injunctions made by Morendil in his Judgement of CFJ 1045.
