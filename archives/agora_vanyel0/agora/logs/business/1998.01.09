Ah.  Good point.  I had not noticed that breaking the Rules was not defined as
a Crime.  In that case, you *were* authorized by R1435 to issue the penalty PO.
There was a CFJ (I forget the number) which judged that a statement "Player X
gains Y Blots" is equivalent to executing a PO, as long as Player X has the
proper authority to issue that PO.  Looks like I will have to revise my
records, and to consider this PO as having been issued.  It also makes my call
for an Appeal to Append and Injunction unnecessary.  Although I am curious as
to what Players think of the initation of this kind of appeal?  Does it require
three Players?  Can it not be initiated at all?  Or can anyone initiate it
since the requirements for its initiation do not seem to be defined anywhere?

If breaking Rules is not a Crime, then I think you have already issued the PO. 
As to it being appealed, though, R1564 states:

      The insistence of a single Player shall initiate an appeal if
      the appeal is of an Injunction which names the insisting Player,
      if the appeal is of a Judgement that found a Crime had been
                                                   ^^^^^
      committed by the insisting Player, or if the insisting Player is
      the Judge who made the decision that is appealed.

Again, if breaking a Rule is not a Crime, then this paragraph does not apply to
CFJ 1078 and it will take two other Players to initiate the appeal of the
judgement.  Morendil's appeal of the Injunction associated with this judgement
is valid, however.

Since I consider not defining Rule breaking as a Crime an oversight, I hereby
also call for the appeal of CFJ 1078.  Morendil should be given full
consideration in this matter.
