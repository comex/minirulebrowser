     THE AGORA WEEKLY JOURNAL
     VOLUME 42, ISSUE 9
     Sunday edition
     November 30, 1997


PROPOSALS
---------

11/23  Murphy protoes "Indefinite Offices", allowing the Speaker to
         declare that a given Office's Term of Service won't expire
         (till it changes hands for some other reason).  This is a
         revival of Blob's old proto "Perpetual Offices".

       Murphy protoes "Make the PVE Permanent", removing the Public
         Voting Experiment's self-repeal clause.

       Murphy protoes a repeal of Rule 1744.

       Murphy protoes "Declaration of Absence", an analogue of
         Declaration of Presence:  Doesn't count toward Quorum, but
         does count as having deliberately responded to the Proposal.

11/24  Proposal 3614 [Crito]    Persistent Style
                                  (Style is not reset quarterly; bonus
                                   only for beating one's old high
                                   Style)
       Proposal 3615 [Swann]    Objects
                                  (Sweeping Currency reform)
       Proposal 3616 [G. Chaos] Nonchallenge of Election Results
                                  (Self-ratification after seven days)
       Proposal 3617 [G. Chaos] No Double Penalties for Officers
                                  (who fail to publish weekly Report)
       Proposal 3618 [G. Chaos] Fix Indulgence Distribution
                                  (Base it on Blots executed minus
                                   Blots vacated)
       Proposal 3619 [G. Chaos] Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank
                                  (Currency transfers to Bank are
                                   reversed unless they state and
                                   accomplish a purpose)
       Proposal 3620 [Steve]    Resignation and Consent
                                  (Resigning Officer's successor does
                                   not take Office till consenting)
       Proposal 3621 [Michael]  Resignation of Offices cleared up
                                  (Resigning Officer's successor must
                                   consent prior to resignation)
       Proposal 3622 [elJefe]   No nonplayer responsibilities
                                  ("role or position to which a Rule
                                   assigns any duties or powers")

       Steve protoes "Judicial Extensions", allowing the Clerk of the
         Courts to grant a one-week extension to Judges.  (If the CotC
         is Judge, then this extension must be granted by the Speaker.)

       InterNomic Proposal 350 fails.

       Swann protoes "Stylish Rules", assigning Style to Rules and
         setting up some mechanisms for changing the Style of Rules.

11/25  Steve re-protoes "Judicial Extensions", making the CotC apply to
         the Justiciar rather than the Speaker for an extension.

       Agora submits InterNomic Proposal 352 (to add Bluesmobile Nomic
         to the list of voting members).

       Swann re-protoes "Stylish Rules", which now assigns new duties
         only to the Wizard (not to the Rulekeepor as well).

       Swann protoes "Risky Quorum", causing one Proposal per week to
         have Quorum of one - but the identity of that Proposal is not
         revealed till the Voting Period ends.

       Swann protoes "Quorum buyback", allowing Players to spend a
         P-Note to reduce a given Proposal's Quorum by one.

       Swann protoes "Quorum without objection", allowing the Speaker
         to declare Without Objection that a Proposal has met Quorum.

11/26  Blob re-protoes "Perpetual Offices".

       InterNomic Proposal 351 (a typo fix to Rule 349) is adopted.
         Agora scores 2 points.

       Swann protoes "Magnetism", a variant of the old Win Tokens.

       Chuck protoes "Repeal Rule Attributions".

11/27  Murphy Proposes "Fix Nominations", clarifying the timing of
         disqualification of Nominees for Office.

       Murphy re-protoes "Declaration of Absence", also repealing the
         ABSTAIN Vote (and a few other fixes).

11/28  elJefe protoes "Late Judgements", allowing the CotC to accept
         same and assign a milder penalty than failing to Judge.

       Proposal 3623 [G. Chaos] Lowered Quorum
                                  (1/3 Active Players or 1/5 Players)

11/30  elJefe protoes "Organizational Payment Orders", authorizing
         Organizations to execute Payment Orders from themselves or
         their members, as authorized by their SLC.

       Proposals 3601-3613 all fail:  the Rule defining Transfer Orders
         is Infected by the Virus, therefore no Voting Tokens could be
         spent to Vote on those Proposals, therefore no Votes counted.

Persistent Indebtedness

I realized, as I was preparing the P-Note report but after the Herald's
report, that Persistent Indebtedness is once again in force.  As a result of
this and outstanding Payment Orders for Indulgences, the following Players are
each guilty of Persistent Indebtedness for Indulgences:

Steve is hereby commanded to pay 1 Indulgence to the Bank.
Murphy is hereby commanded to pay 1 Indulgence to the Bank.
Swann is hereby commanded to pay 1 Indulgence to the Bank.

Normally I would distribute this week's latest
batch of proposals at this time.  However, at
Scott's suggestion, I will delay this distribution
until tomorrow to make sure the Transfer Order
Rule has been disinfected prior to the end of its
voting period.

Also, for those of you who want warnings about
proposals, it is my intention to have the Herald's
and Promotor's reports ratified as part of the
final resolution of the past Currency crisis.

It's a bit embarassing to start this with a payment to myself, but I
am required by 1748 to issue payment orders for 5 VTs and for 2
P-notes, both from the bank to myself, because INP 351 was made by me
and accepted by IN.

COE on Promotor's Report

I realized I made two error's on the P-Note report.  One, Zefram is no longer a
Player, and therefore is not capable of committing Persistent Indebtedness
Infractions (there is no Executor for Zefram to gain this Blot either).  Two,
the calculations for Bank P-Note holdings were invalid.  It showed the Bank
with 48 P-Notes when it should have been 52.

This is a COE which I admit.  Zefram's PO for an Indulgence, POI306, is hereby
vacated.  A corrected P-Note report is attached.  This is a newly issued report
so I can make my intended ratification of it unambiguously.

Oops.  Scott made the same mistake I did.  Vlad was deregistered on Nov. 14,
according to my records and so cannot commit Persistent Indebtedness.  This is
a COE.

H. Promotor Crito!

I hereby submit the following 2 Proposals, paying the Petition Fees
to do so.

======================================================================
Proposal
Left In A Huff!

Be it hereby resolved that Waggie, Gecko, Kelly, Swann, KoJen, Zefram
and Vlad be awarded the Patent Title of Left In A Huff.

======================================================================
Proposal
Electioneering and the Public Voting Experiment

[Comment: it occurs to me that during the Public Voting Experiment,
we might as well allow the Assessor to publish summaries of everyone's
votes, since votes are being sent to the PF anyway.] 

[Comment: fixed the bug noted by Harlequin.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 452 be amended by replacing in it
the text which currently reads:

      This Rule shall in no way prohibit the Vote Collector from
      posting, at any time and to the Public Forum, a list of those
      Voting Entities which have already voted or declared that they
      are Present on a given Proposal, Election or Referendum, as
      long as e does not indicate specifically whether the Voting
      Entity has voted or declared Presence. Doing so is not a Crime,
      unless specified as such by another Rule.

with text which reads:

      This Rule shall in no way prohibit the Vote Collector from
      posting, at any time and to the Public Forum, a list of those
      Voting Entities which have already voted or declared that they
      are Present on a given Proposal, Election or Referendum. If a
      vote or declaration of Presence has already appeared in the
      Public Forum prior to the publication of such a list, and has
      not subsequently been altered, then the Vote Collector is
      permitted to indicate what that vote was, or whether it was a
      declaration of Presence. Otherwise, the Vote Collector is
      prohibited from specifically indicating whether and how the
      Voting Entity has voted, or declared Presence. The publication
      of a list as described in this Rule is not a Crime, unless
      specified as such by another Rule.
