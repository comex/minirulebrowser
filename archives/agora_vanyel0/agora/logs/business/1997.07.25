Oh hell.

According to the latest (July 21) Currency reports, Elde has 17 VTs and
5 P-Notes.  Due to his Agoran inactivity of late, I assume that that hasn't
changed since.

To the best of my knowledge, Elde had no creditors or heirs.  I therefore
submit the following Transfer Orders:

     17 VTs from Elde's estate to the Bank
     5 P-Notes from Elde's estate to the Bank

I hereby announce that Probate of Elde's estate is complete.

Proposal 3539 was Disowned; I neglected to account for this in my
recent Report.

Thus: The Payment Order requiring Andre to pay 4 P-Notes to the Bank
is hereby vacated as improperly made.  My apologies to Andre.

This is a Claim of Error to the effect that Murphy did not grant emself 
sufficient authority to execute such Transfer Orders as are listed above, in 
that the quoted message makes no mention of either Murphy's acting in eir 
capacity of the Notary, or of eir acting, in that capacity, on Elde's behalf as 
Elde's Executor. This is therefore in contravention of Rule 1478's provisions
that:

      Whenever a Player is acting on behalf of some entity of which e
      is the Executor other than emself, e must make it clear that e
      is doing so.  If such a Player fails to clearly indicate that e
      is acting as the Executor of some other entity, it shall be
      presumed that e is acting on eir own behalf.

In addition, the above message does not comply with the following provisions of
Rule 1738 :

      Whenever there is an entity in Probate which does not have an
      Executor in Probate, the Notary shall nominate a Player to be
      that entity's Executor in Probate.  E shall announce this
      appointment in the Public Forum.

Boy - isn't this fun ? ;)

More Pragmatic Currency Fun

Here's an interesting situation.

On Thursday, July 24, Elde was reported to have commited the infraction of
failing to Judge, which carries a penalty of 3 Blots.  Penalties are assessed
at the time of the reporting per R1503 and R1504.  The message reporting this
infraction did not contain any specific order requesting Elde to pay the 3
Indulgences required by this pentaly.

On Friday, July 25, Elde was deregistered, prior to any explicit PO being
issued to em for those 3 Blots.

So how many Blots does Elde have at the time of eir registration?

My take on it is based on R1504 -

      Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their
      legal report, and the Player making the report of the Infraction
      shall execute whatever Payment Order(s) are required to apply
      the penalty specified for that Infraction.

The PO should have been issued by Michael at the time of eir report.  I'd like
to treat Michael's report as an implicit PO, already in effect at the time of
Elde's deregistration.  This seems reasonable even though there is no specific
provision in the Rules for implicit POs as there is for implicit TOs.  If this
is not the case, what is the status?  Can a Blot exist without a PO?

What do you think?

Heads up to Blob and elJefe.  If the report is an implicit PO, then you should
be aware that you will have to transfer Indulgences to satisfy your Blots
before Monday to avoid Persistent Indebtedness, even though I have not yet
officially reported the existence of these POs.
