Judgement of CFJ 1114

Judgement: FALSE

Reasoning:

[This is a joint opinion, authored by Blob and General Chaos, to apply
to both CFJ 1114 and CFJ 1115.  We are of the opinion that the
Statements of both CFJs are, for all intents and purposes,
equivalent.]

With respect to Peekee's first argument that R1715 claims to take
precedence over R1764, we are presented with the issue of interpreting
the clause:

     This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which determine
     Quorum or whether a Proposal, Election or Referendum has met
     Quorum.

Now Peekee argues that R1764 affects whether a Proposal has met
Quorum, and thus falls under this clause. Now strictly speaking he may
be correct.  The existence of R1764 may affect the validity of certain
messages purporting to be votes or declarations of presence, which in
turn could affect whether a given proposal achieves Quorum; but the
argument need not stop there. By this reasoning, Rule 1715 takes
precedence over Rule 1664, to choose a rule arbitrarily, because the
guidelines as to whether or not a Rebellion succeeds may affect the
number of Indulgences a Player has, which may affect whether he
becomes Lawless, which in turn may affect the number of Players
registered at the time a Proposal is distributed, which will determine
Quorum for that Proposal. To argue, on this basis, that Rule 1715
takes precedence over Rule 1664 is clearly nonsense.

And so we must draw a line with regard to how long a chain of
causality we are going to use to determine the meaning of precedence
statements like that in Rule 1715. Another possible interpretation of
this case is to say that Rules 879 and 1715 alone determine Quorum in
this instance, and that Rule 1764 merely affects the circumstances
which these rules use to make this determination. We judge that this
is also a valid, common-sense interpretation of the Rules, and is in
the best interests of the game.  It avoids endless complexity in the
determination of precedence between rules.

By this reasoning, the precedence clause of Rule 1715 cannot be
applied to Rule 1764, so the latter, by its own claims, takes
precedence, and so Peekee's first argument is incorrect.

With respect to Peekee's second argument, that a message that attempts
to declare Presence on a Proposal by its own nature contains, by its
own nature a "clear indication" of the intent that that message be a
Public Forum Message, requires us to interpret Rule 478's "alternative
media" paragraph, and specifically what is necessary for a message to
"bear a clear indication that it is intended to be a message to the
Public Forum".

Peekee argues that, because declarations of Presence must legally be
posted to a Public Forum to be effective, any Player who communicates
a declaration of Presence necessarily intended that that communication
be posted to a Public Forum, even if e did not actually send it to a
designated Public Forum.  In short, Peekee asks us to construe Rule
478's alternative media paragragh so as to allow inference of intent
from conduct.

We admit that this reading of Rule 478 is not irrational, and is
indeed not without merit.  However, we do not believe that this
reading is compelled by the language of the Rule.  We further note
that there is substantial Game Custom already in place that weighs
against this reading.  Additionally, we contend that it is against the
best interest of the Game to adopt this policy, since Officers are not
generally in the habit of reading the primary discussion forum with
any consistent degree of diligence, and generally operate on the
reliance that no Official communications will be thereby communicated.

We therefore elect to reject Peekee's proposed interpretation.
Instead, we choose to interpret Rule 478's requirement of a "clear
indication" as requiring an explicit declaration that the message is
intended to be a Public Forum message.  This interpretation is
consistent with the Rule's text, and further is in harmony with
longstanding Game Custom.

Since it is evident that Peekee's message contains no such
declaration, we need not reach the factual questions of whether Peekee
actually had such an intent, or whether the message in question was
sent to every Player.

Because we have ruled that Rule 1764 is successful in requiring
declarations of Presence be sent to a Public Forum, and that Rule 478
requires messages being sent to the Public Forum by distribution to
all Players other than by a designated Public Forum medium bear an
explicit declaration of intent, and have found that Peekee's message
lacked such a declaration, we conclude that the Statements of CFJs
1114 and 1115 are both FALSE.

I very much doubt that Andre's decision was taken in haste. By
concentrating on the issue of the level of Unemployment Benefits and the
Voting Tariff, you miss the bigger picture. As Andre himself declared in
the same post, his opposition to the BOS and its attendant concepts is
deep-rooted. Clearly, by setting the BOS to zero, he hopes to put what
pressure he can on you to set the Voting Tariff also to zero (or at
least to a very low level), so that we might simulate a return to the
days of free voting, as indeed we did during the last three months of
1998. In this, the fact that he cannot change his decision for a whole
month after he makes it is a powerful weapon in his hands. Effectively,
we have to find a way to remove him from Office before March 1, or
change the Rules before then; otherwise, he'll repeat the manoeuvre next
month.

Bravo to Andre for accepting our invitation last month to play hard and
bring on a political showdown over the direction of the economy. This is
the way a political game should be played.

H. Herald Crito,

I hereby transfer a Kudo 

FROM myself, for want of a better source,
TO Andre, in recognition of his fine play.

H. Promotor G. Chaos,

I hereby submit the following Proposal, paying 2 P-Notes to raise its
Priority to 2:

####
Proposal
Repeal Impeachment

[Comment: in my view, given the variety and greater subtlety of other
methods for removing a Player from Office, we don't need this Sword of
Damocles hanging by a thread over Officers' heads. It's absurd that any
one Player can initiate such a divisive procedure at any time.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 1486 (Procedure to Impeach an Officer)
be repealed.

I hereby call for judgement on the following statement: 

Players may bar Players from Judgement in the sense of Rule 897 by
specifying the Players to be barred at a time other than that of the
submission of the CFJ. 

Reasoning: 

This possibility is not prohibited by R897, and so, by our general
principle of the permissibility of the unprohibited (R116), is
permitted.  The Judge may wish to expand on the effect that a barring 
might have if specified after a Judge selection was made.  I think
precedent (specifically, the decision that Players can not make
themselves ineligible for CFJs not yet called), makes it clear that
one couldn't bar possible judges before actually making a CFJ.

This message contains exactly one Proposal.  The Proposal begins
immediately after the line marked "**START PROPOSAL" and ends at the
end of the message.
  
The following Proposal is to be titled "Proposals may Order" and is to
have Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1794 be amended to read:

      (a) Each Order is of one of the following classes:
        (1) Judicial: A Judicial Order is an Order executed by a
            Player while acting as a Judge.
        (2) Appellate: An Appellate Order is an Order executed by a
            Board of Appeals.
        (3) Administrative: An Administrative Order is an Order
            executed by an Officer in the course of performing the
            duties of that Office, except when those duties involve
            acting as a member of a Board of Appeals.
        (4) Legislative: A Legislative Order is an Order executed as
            part of the effect of the adoption of a Proposal.
        (5) Private: A Private Order is any Order not described above.

      (b) For the purpose of this Rule, the holder of any of the
          following positions shall be considered an Officer when
          performing a duty required by or a privilege permitted only
          by virtue of holding that position:
        (1) the Speaker;
        (2) the Recordkeepor of a Currency; or
        (3) the Trustee of an entity in Probate.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) A Proposal may contain one or more Orders.

      (b) The effect of adopting a Proposal which contains Orders is
          to execute those Orders.  Such Orders are known as
          Legislative Orders, are deemed to have been executed by that
          Proposal, and are deemed to have been executed as of the
          date of the proclamation of the Proposal's adoption.

      (c) Legislative Orders may not be stayed, vacated, or amended
          except:
        (1) by a subsequent Legislative Order;
        (2) by a Judicial Order issued only after a judicial finding
            that the Proposal containing the Legislative Order was not
            adopted, was barred from taking effect, or was invalid; or
        (3) by the Clerk of the Courts, but only for the purpose of
            staying such an Order during the pendency of a dispute
            which might reasonably lead to a judicial finding of the
            sort mentioned in subdivision (c)(2) of this Rule.

This message contains exactly one Proposal.  The Proposal begins
immediately after the line marked "**START PROPOSAL" and ends at the
end of the message.
  
The following Proposal is to be titled "Summary Adoption" and is to
have Adoption Index 3.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it therefore resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 3, to
read:

      (a) The Proposer of any Proposal may cause it to be Adopted
          Without Objection, but only if the Proposal has not yet been
          distributed.

      (b) A Proposal Adopted Without Objection is Adopted at the time
          its Proposer changes its status to Adopted in accordance
          with the procedure for performing changes Without Objection,
          but only if at that time that Proposal has not yet been
          distributed.

      (c) When a Proposal is Adopted Without Objection, it is removed
          from the Queue.

      (d) This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would prevent
          a Proposal from being Adopted Without Objection, and over
          any Rule which would prevent a Proposal Adopted Without
          Objection from being removed from the Proposal Queue.

          above.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

          other existing Organization.

      (b) A Notice of Change of Organizational Name may be rescinded

          the Organization in question.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1612 be amended to read:

      (a) An Organization's name shall only be changed when its Agent

      (c) A Notice of Change of Organizational Charter may be

      (d) In any CFJ alleging that the Charter of an Organization has
          been changed improperly, the Judge shall consider the
          Charter as it existed prior to the Change.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1531 be amended to read:

      (a) The Agent of an Organization must be a natural person.

      (b) The Agent of an Organization is required to abide by the
          Charter and Bylaws (if any) of that Organization.

            of Organizational Agent to the Notary, setting forth the
            current name of the Organization and its new Agent;

        (3) by Judicial Order, when the Rules permit such an Order to
            issue.

      (e) No person shall be made the Agent of an Organization without
          eir consent.  Any person who submits a Notice of Change of
          Organizational Agent certifies under penalty of
          Falsification that the new Agent consents.

      (f) A Notice of Change of Organizational Agent may be rescinded
          by Judicial Order; such Order shall properly issue when the

          in fact consent.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1759 be amended to read:

      The Executor of an Organization may execute Payment Orders, as

      Orders which name either the Organization itself or any Member
      thereof as payor.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1533 be amended to read:

      (a) An Organization may be created by the Execution of an

      (c) An Application to Create an Organization is Executed by

          Organization so described if the Application is valid.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1397 be amended to read:

      (a) An Organization shall be subject to dissolution when:
        (1) it ceases to have any of the items required of an
            Organization by the Rules; or

          requires the Signature of the Executor of the entity to
          which the Will is to belong, and is Executed by submitting
          it to the Notary.  The effect of Executing such an
          Application is to create a Will belonging to that entity. 
          Any prior Will belonging to that entity is destroyed at the

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Each Organization in existence prior to the adoption of the
          Proposal which created this Rule is deemed to be an
          Organization created under the authority of these Rules, all
          other Rules notwithstanding.  The Charter of each such
          Organization shall be its former SLC, the Agent shall be the
          Adminstrator of its former SLC, and its Membership shall be
          those Players who were within the Jurisdiction of its former
          SLC.

      (b) This Rule in no way prevents the change of any of the
          characteristics set forth above by events occuring after the
          adoption of the Proposal which created this Rule.

      (c) This Rule shall take precedence over every Rule with which
          it conflicts.
