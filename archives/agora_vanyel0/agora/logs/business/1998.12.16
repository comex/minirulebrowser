I was under the pretty strong impression that someone on Hold is not
subject to the requirements of the "Must propose" rule.

I make the following two Transfer Orders:

I hereby transfer one Indulgence from myself to the Bank to satisfy
Order pin003.

I hereby transfer one P-Note from myself to the Bank to satisfy
Order ppn003.

(I hope these orders will satisfy the POs in question, even though I may
not have the currency to back them; or has this been changed with the
adoption of a Currency proposal.  It's so difficult trying to pay
attention
when you're on holiday.)

I hereby claim that the above POs were issued in error.  I believe this
claim is enough to constitute a COE.

Regards,
Michael

So did a couple of other people, but we have discussed that issue in
agora-discussion, and the rule is quite clear that you were not
absolved of this requirement. I deny your COE. (But I encourage you,
or anyone else, to fix this.)

I'll check the records, but I'm pretty sure you do have the P-Note to
pay this. If not, I'll pay it for you.
