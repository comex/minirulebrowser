R1817 says that the Recordkeepor is not required to abide by a TO which
would result in an entity posessing a negative quantity of Currency. It
also says that Transfers shall be noted in the order in which they are
receieved. So even if the condition was to become true at a later date,
the Recordkeepor is forbidden to obey it, if any later transfer had 
already been noted.
