In spite of the annoying typo, I vote FOR INP365.

Wish I had time for both IN and Agora.  As things are going right now, I don't
have time to evaluate the more complicated proposals. 8(

It would appear that my 2 Votes AGAINST the 3 Vote requirement only caused
the supporters to cough up more support.  Fair enough.

The reason I opposed it was that there would no longer be (and now there
is not) any way to cheaply pass trivial fixes and public service Proposals
that do not carry significant political interest.

In this spirit, I am discontinuing my admittedly slow work on the Spring
Cleaning Proto.  While spell checking and minor bug fixes may be nice, I
do not consider it to be worth 3 VTs.

Also in the spirit of Scarcity, I will no longer be voting FOR or
declaring Presence on _any_ Proposals without prior agreement.

For Proposals that I otherwise support, agreements involving bribes will
normally be accepted.  My initial standard rates will be 0.2 VTs for
Presence and 1.3 VTs for voting FOR.

Greetings,
Ørjan.
