I don't see why that's warranted. Only Zefram and I will bear any
responsibility for the wording the Rule will have if P3578 is adopted. 
None of the other Authors are currently listed, and if you wish to
note their contributions to previous versions of the Rule, all you have
to is find out who made the various Proposals which have amended
R1042 previously and note them as having done so in the History.

I hereby cast a second vote FOR P3578.

I hereby make 6 delayed transfers of 1 P-note each to the Bank,
to be executed as soon as the Bank has transferred to me the P-notes
it owes me in the Payment Orders outlined above. These six transfers
are to satisfy the POs for 1 P-note assessed against me, also as outlined
above.

H. Promotor Crito, please do so note, if you don't mind the delayed 
transfers.

I hereby Call for Judgement on the following statement:

  The Office of Speaker-Elect is not now being held in the normal fashion.

Argument:

Rule 1006: An Office must be held by a Player.
Rule 790:  The Winner of the Election shall hold the Office.

This is a conflict.  Rule 790 takes precedence, so Morendil (a non-Player)
holds the Office of Speaker-Elect.

Now:

Rule 1006: An Officer is a player holding an Office.

This is an explicit definition.  There is no conflict with any other Rule,
so the Office of Speaker-Elect is held by someone who is not an Officer
(Morendil).

Rule 790:  An Office is held in the normal fashion only if held by an
_Officer_ who was elected to it (among other things).

The Office of Speaker-Elect does not satisfy this requirement.  Therefore
it is not being held in the normal fashion.

Statement: There exists at least one VT that possesses at least 1 VT.

Judgement: FALSE

Reasons and arguments:

The rules do not mandate what it is for entities to own or possess
Currencies.  Yet it is precisely this ability which is presupposed in
the rules and practice involved with Transfer Orders.  Therefore, we
use common sense in order to resolve this question, and conclude that
VTs can not possess VTs.

To reiterate: it is patently not common-sensical to allow units of
currency to own other units of currency.  Given the absence of
legislation specifying that this should be possible, there seems
little reason to suppose that it should be possible.

Of course, the initial language of the relevant rule about Transfer
Orders (R1598 "Transfer Orders") does suggest that a Transfer Order
can specify any entities as source and destination for the currencies
transferred.  However, subsequent language makes it clear that TOs may
only originate from entities that possess currencies.  Similarly, the
destination entity must support the notion of being "added to" (an
unfortunate phrasing, but one present in the rule: "When a Transfer
Order is executed, ... the number of units of that specified Currency
shall be removed from the source entity and added to the destination
entity."

Thankfully game custom makes a strong case for interpreting "added to"
as meaning "passes into the ownership of".  

A more literal interpretation of this phrase would allow the above
judgement to stand, but would probably invalidate all current economic
activity.  In this alternative conception, transferring 1 VT to
another VT would cause the 1 VT transferred to the destination 1VT to
be added to it, presumably resulting in 2 VTs.  Of course, one could
also create an arbitrary amount of VTs by transferring them to
themselves.  This interpretation is clearly ridiculous so I feel that
justice is being upheld in appealing to common sense and game custom
to override the peculiar wording of R1598.

Michael.

Rule 1743

In accordance with Rule 1743, I hereby report, to the best of my knowledge, all
outstanding, unreported Infractions of Persistent Indebtedness.  AFAICT, R1596
allows POs to be assessed against any entity, including deregistered Players,
therefore, I will execute POs for all Infractions listed below, even to those
who have since left us.  Of course, since they will all be vacated anyway, the
point is moot.

Thank you, General Chaos, for your helpful information regarding Voting Token
Debt.

Here is a new proposal distributed by the IN moderator. 

I messed up the message in which I sent the proposal to the IN list by
inserting the full text of the proposal twice. Formally, this might be
interpreted as a proposal to create two identical rules. In eir
message distributing the proposal the IN moderator remarked:

>>
As for the second copy of the proposed rule creation, it seems 
appropriate to distribute it as submitted, and hopefully the
Internomic community can come to consensus as to whether or not
the second copy should be ignored.  My numbering and distribution
of the proposal would not change its content either way, and I do
not have the authority to make that decision.
<<

I apologize for the inconvenience, but hope that this will turn out to
be a harmless diversion. If people don't just ignore this as a kind of
typo, it will also trigger a discussion about the possibility to
create more than one rule with one proposal - as far as I am aware,
this point has not been settled yet in IN.

The date header of the distribution message was Sat, 01 Nov 1997
14:57:45 -0400, so I will collect votes for our referendum on this
proposal until Sat, 08 Nov 1997 14:57:45 -0400.

---Text of the proposal---
Let the following rule be created:

     Any nomic that objects to the actions of a player in Internomic may 
     make a formal protest by sending a message to the moderator 
     detailing the objectionable act the nomic is protesting.  The 
     moderator must then make the protest known to all players of 
     Internomic.  Voting players of Internomic may second the protest by 
     sending a message to the moderator stating that they agree the act 
     is objectionable.  If, within five days of the protest being made 
     known, at least one voting player of Internomic (other than the 
     nomic making the formal protest) seconds the formal protest, the 
     moderator shall call a vote on sanctions.  No formal protests shall
     be permitted while a vote on shanctions is taking place.

     Immediatly after the moderator calls for a vote on sanctions, the 
     moderator shall collect votes form all voting members for a period 
     of two weeks.  Immediately after this period, e shall make known 
     the results, which shall be as follows;

       i) If 25% or less of voting members voted FOR sanctions;
          If the protesting nomic is a player, it shall lose 10 points.
          The protesting nomic shall be forbidden from making any formal 
          protests for a period of two months after the vote's 
          conclusion.
          Any nomic that seconded the protest shall loose 5 points.

      ii) If more than 25% and less than 50% of voting members voted FOR
          sanctions;
          If the protesting nomic is a player, it shall lose 7 points.
          The protesting nomic shall be forbidden from making any formal 
          protests for a period of one month after the vote's 
          conclusion.
          Any nomic that seconded the protest shall loose 3 points.

     iii) If 50% or more of the voting members voted FOR sanctions;
          The player being protested shall lose 10 points.
          The player being protested shall lose an additional 10 points 
          if all other voting members voted FOR sanctions.

Let the following rule be created:

     Any nomic that objects to the actions of a player in Internomic may

     moderator shall call a vote on sanctions.  No formal protests shall
     be permitted while a vote on shanctions is taking place.

          The protesting nomic shall be forbidden from making any formal 
          protests for a period of two months after the vote's 
          conclusion.
          Any nomic that seconded the protest shall loose 5 points.

      ii) If more than 25% and less than 50% of voting members voted FOR

H. Cartographor and Registrar, please note:

I move to the Beer Hall.

I rebel.

I move to the Mad Scientist's lab to apologize to the Cartographor for
all the work I'm causing em.

I then move to the Origin to apologize to the Registrar, too,
especially as e had a COE on my abiding status to deal with just now.

I then spread further unrest and rumours among the masses assembled at
the origin... ;)

The above Payment Orders are hereby vacated, on the grounds that
Proposals 3534 through 3538 were not Disinterested, and for each, its
Sponsor was in fact its Proposer.  Since each of these Proposals
failed 0-0, its Sponsor receives no award or penalty.

I believe the Promotor's references for these five Payment Orders are
POP002, POP003, POP004, POP005, and POP006.

It is also worth nothing that if elJefe's CFJ is judged TRUE, then
Morendil is a Tainted Speaker, as he did not hold the Office of
Speaker-Elect in the normal fashion at the time of his ascension
to the Speakership, In that case, the winner of the Election for
Speaker-Elect which has just commenced will become Speaker.

I nominate for the Office of Speaker-Elect.
