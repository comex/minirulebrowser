COE denied. I do not regard the phrase 'Judgement:' without a Judgement
following it as claiming the absence of a Judgement of TRUE, and thus I 
do not regard this phrase as a misrepresentation of the actual Gamestate.

I noticed this earlier, but was thinking about it and collecting evidence :)

I hereby call for Judgement on the statement: "Elde is in violation of Rule
478 in that e is not able to receive messages sent to the Public Forum."
barring Morendil & Blob.  Relevant Rules: R478

I hereby call for Judgement on the statement: "Blob is in violation of Rule
478 in that e is not able to receive messages sent to the Public Forum."
barring Morendil & Elde.  Relevant Rules: R478

The following is evidence for both of the above CFJs:

R478 (in part)

      It is the responsibility of each Active Player to ensure that e
      is able to receive messages sent to every medium which the
      Registrar has designated as a Public Forum.  The temporary
      inability of a Player to receive a Public Forum does not deprive
      that medium of any legal significance as a Public Forum.

Latest Registrar's report: (in part)

======================================================================

                               CFJ 933

"All Voting Tokens were destroyed as a result of the Pragmatic
 Currencies Proposal taking effect."

======================================================================

To judge this statement, I asked myself a few questions:

Q:What was the state of the world before the Pragmatic Currencies Proposal?

A:The Mint, as defined by Rule 1470, was the Mintor of VTs.

Q: What changes to the game state were made as a result of this Proposal?

A:Rule 1470 was amended so it no longer defined the Mint and Rule 1696 was
amended to make the Bank the Mintor of VTs.

Q:What were the effects of this change?

A:Since the Mint was no longer defined, it ceased to exist, by Rule 1586.
At the time it ceased to exist, it was the Mintor of VTs. The Bank became
the Mintor of VTs.

Q:Were the VTs destroyed?

Rule 1579 states:

      If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist, or ceases to have
      the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that Currency
      are destroyed, and that Currency ceases to exist.

A:The Mintor of VTs was the Mint.  The Bank ceased to exist.  Therefore,
the Bank, being the Mintor of VTs, ceased to exist, so all VTs were
destroyed.  In my opinion, there was no instant in time when VTs did not
have a Mintor.  R1579, however, states that all units of a Currency are
destroyed "If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist".  It does not state
that they're destroyed "If a Currency does not have a Mintor".  These are
two very different phrases.

Q:Do the rules have authority to "interfere" in the execution of a
proposal?  Do the rules have the authority to stop a proposal in
mid-execution and change the game state?

A:The answer to this question does not alter the judgement of this CFJ.
Whether the rules interfered or not, the Mintor of VTs was destroyed.  The
rules did not make an exception in the case that a new Mintor of VTs was
defined.

I hereby rule that CFJ 933 was correctly judged TRUE.
