Proto:  Yet Another Probate Fix

----- begin proto -----

Amend Rule 1755 by replacing "executor in probate" with "Trustee".

Amend Rule 1637 by replacing "Executor in Probate" with "Trustee".

Rename Rule 1738 to "Trustees".

-----  end proto  -----

I hereby announce that the following estates enter Probate, if they are not
already in Probate; furthermore, I hereby announce the following Trustee
assignments, if they are not already assigned.  The rest of the information
is just there for convenience.  Trustees for Andre, ChrisM, Elde, and Vir were
selected randomly by rolling a 20-sided die, re-rolling on 17-20 (there are
currently 16 Players).

Entity         Trustee     VTs  P-Notes  Indulgences  Other
-----------------------------------------------------------
Andre          Morendil    75      7          1       1 Blot
Antimatter     Harlequin    2      0         11
ChrisM         Sherlock     9.5    0          6
Elde           Blob         6      0          1
Vir            Time Agent  15.1    0         31
Voodoo Lounge  Morendil     0.8    0          0
Zefram         Murphy       2.5    2          6       3 P-Notes owed to Bank

(Calabresi, Morendil, Vanyel, and Vlad are definitely no longer in Probate,
and have no reason to re-enter it.)

Scott, what is your intended definition of "terminal", and would you please
Propose to create a Rule defining it?

H. Promotor, please note; I hereby submit the following Proposal.

Proposal
---
One More Probate Fix

 Amend Rule 1601, replacing text which reads

      No entity may be destroyed while it possesses Units of Currency
      or while it is named as the Payee or Payor of any Payment
      Orders; any attempt to destroy an entity while it is in this
      condition shall be deferred until this condition no longer
      holds.

with text reading

      No entity may be destroyed while it possesses Units of Currency
      or while it is named as the Payee or Payor of any Payment
      Orders; any attempt to destroy an entity while it is in this
      condition shall be deferred until this condition no longer
      holds, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding. An entity which
      would otherwise be destroyed but the destruction of which is being 
      deferred due to the foregoing provisions is called 'terminal'.

[Restores the meaning of 'terminal'; adds a precedence clause for 
safety.]

I vote AGAINST proposal 360.

Reasoning: This Nomic has yet to enact one single rule; it's stability
	   seems unclear to me.

The PO described in this message cannot be satisfied by the above transfer
order.  This does not prevent the transfer from taking place.  However,
Chancellor take note, Rules 1754 and 1763 now impose an obligation on the
Chancellor to transfer this P-Note back to Kolja.

The PO described in this message cannot be satisfied by the above transfer
order.  This does not prevent the transfer from taking place.  However,
Chancellor take note, Rules 1754 and 1763 now impose an obligation on the
Chancellor to transfer this P-Note back to Kolja.

Stupid me! I'll try again: I hereby transfer 1 P-note from myself to
the bank to satisfy the recent PO naming me as payor that was issued
in the line below or above the PO cited above. Sorry for the
confusion!

H. Herald Crito!

I hereby transfer a kudo

FROM  Ambassador Kolja, for being late with Agora's vote on INP 359,

TO    Morendil, for his wonderful Apology for having violated R1729,
      which in my opinion compensates for the dishonour of having
      violated it in the first place.
