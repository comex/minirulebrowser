I judge FALSE.

Rule 1577 says:

      Each Currency shall have associated with it a Minimum Unit
      Quantity (MUQ).  This quantity is the smallest amount of that
      Currency which is permitted to be transferred.  All transfers
      and holdings of a Currency shall be rounded off to the nearest
      multiple of its MUQ.

      The MUQ of a given Currency is 1 if no other specification
      exists.


Clearly, then, zero Transfers are prohibited.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

It seems I did miss this after all.  I hereby transfer 2 VTs to
the bank in order to satisfy RVTPO349.

And, sadly, I don't even have a good excuse for this one--it just
slipped my mind.  Therefore, I transfer a Kudo from myself to
Swann, for his excellent work in Agoran history.

I'll be adding a logging function to my SLR and FLR mailing
scripts so that even if I delete the actual post, I can easily
determine for myself whether I sent one out in a given period.
