I believe that 1598 has been disinfected by now, so I'll try again to
satisfy various POs by making the following TOs:

I transfer 1 P-note from me to the bank to satisfy POP053. 

I transfer 1 indulgence from me to the bank to satisfy the PI penalty
PO issued by Herald Crito Tue, 2 Dec 1997. (For the propmotor's
convenience only, I _think_ the number is POI307, but I'd rather ot
name this in the TO itself).

I transfer 1 indulgence from me to the bank to satisfy the PI penalty

Proposal 3538 (Restore Game Balance II) had no substantial effect
because at the time it was adopted no entity possessed a non-zero
number of VTs.  The Rule it created therefore required no adjustments
to be made.

I leave it to the Rulekeepor, and others, to determine whether this is
sufficient to effectuate its self-repeal.

Er, no, I am in error.  This Rule actuall had a substantial effect.  I
shall have to revise VT balances because its effect was to give each
Player 5 VTs.  The consequences should be fascinating.

H. Promotor, 

please note the following proposal:

Amend the rule created by Proposal 3612 (The Repeal-O-Matic II) by
inserting the following text as a new paragraph, after the string "and
[Power] is replaced by the Power of that same Rule.": 

>>
If a rule picked by the promotor explicitly refers to other rules or
to concepts or entities that also appear in other rules, the promotor
is authorized, but not obliged, to add provisions to the Proposal that
leave the ruleset in a more consistent and functional state after the
repeal of the rule picked by the promotor.

Note, in view of the further Currency complications caused by 
the discovery that P3637 passed, I do not think it prudent to
ratify the Reports mentioned in P3530. Hence I'm voting AGAINST.
