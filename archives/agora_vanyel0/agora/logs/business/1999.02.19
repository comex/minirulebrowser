Proposal: Changing the Bar Height

Create a rule, with title "The Priority Bar", and text:

      (a) The Priority Bar is the minimum Priority needed for a 
          Proposal to be distributed. It is an integer multiple of 
          the MUQ of P-Notes, lying between zero and two inclusive.

      (b) Upon the adoption of the proposal which created this rule,
          its value shall be set to one.


      (c) The Promotor may change the value of the Priority Bar by
          announcing its new value in the Public Forum, provided that
          the new value is within the range allowed by subdivision (a)
          of this Rule.

      (d) Whenever a new value is announced according to subdivision
          (c) of this Rule, the new value takes effect at the
          beginning of the next Nomic Week, unless the announcement is
          made within three days of the end of the current Nomic Week,
          in which case the new value takes effect at the beginning of
          the Nomic Week following the next Nomic Week.

Amend Rule 1036 by replacing the text:

      A Proposal's Priority is an integer value. All Proposals
      initially have a Priority of zero.

with:

      A Proposal's Priority is an integer multiple of the MUQ of
      P-Notes. All Proposals initially have a Priority of zero.

Amend Rule 1771 to read:

      A Player may increase or decrease the Priority of a Proposal
      in the Queue by announcing to the Public Forum that e does so,
      and paying a number of P-Notes to the Bank. 

      The Priority of the Proposal is increased or decreased, as 
      specified by the Player making the payment, by an amount equal
      to the number of P-Notes transferred to the Bank, provided 
      that this transfer is not executed for any other purpose.

Amend Rule 1770 by replacing the text:

      If the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue with a
      Priority greater than zero is less than or equal to the Batch
      Size, then the batch shall consist of all such Proposals.

      If the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue is greater
      than the Batch Size, then the batch shall consist of those
      Proposals in the Queue with the highest Priority such that the
      number of Proposals distributed is equal to the Batch Size.

with:

      If the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue with a
      Priority greater than or equal to the Priority Bar is less than 
      or equal to the Batch Size, then the batch shall consist of all 
      such Proposals.

      Otherwise, the batch shall consist of those Proposals in the 
      Queue with the highest Priority such that the number of 
      Proposals distributed is equal to the Batch Size.

Amend Rule 1701 by replacing the text:

      The MUQ of P-Notes is 1.

with

      The MUQ of P-Notes is 0.1.

Create a rule with title "The Promotor's Commission" and text:

      Each week, after distributing a batch of proposals, the 
      Promotor may order the Bank to pay out a number of P-Notes
      equal to five percent of the total Priority of the proposals
      in the batch.

[Comments:

v1.0 - Based on Gen Chaos' "Make the Proposal Queue More Competitive"
       proposal. Changes the minimum Priority needed to get a Proposal
       distributed. Now allows fractional Priorities.

       Benefits:

       1) Promotes competition for Queue positions by increasing the
       range of profitable Priority values.

       2) Allows sharing of support for Proposals

       3) Gives the Promotor a handle on the P-Note economy,

       4) Allows an anti-capitalist Promotor to make proposing free,
          if e so desires. 

v1.1 - Changed references to "real numbers" to "integer multiples of
       the MUQ of P-Notes". It's a bit clumsy, but it's probably 
       safer.

v1.2 - Gave the Promotor a cut of the action, much like the Assessor's.
       As is the case with the Assessor, manipulating the Batch Size
       and the Priority Bar will affect the commission - but should
       e strive to distribute many proposals cheaply, or a few at a
       very high price?

This message contains exactly one Proposal.  The Proposal begins
immediately after the line marked "**START PROPOSAL" and ends at the
end of the message.

The following Proposal is to be titled "Power to the Senate" and is to 
have Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL

Let it there fore be resolved that rule 1717 be amended to read:

There exist Nomic entities know as Senators, there also exists a Nomic 
entity known as the Senate.  Some Players are Senators.  The Senate is 
the set of all Senators.  Only Senators are members of the Senate.

Only players may be senators.  If a Senator is removed from the Senate, 
e ceases to be a Senator.  

A Player who has been registered continuously for the immediately 
preceding two months becomes a Senator, if and only if e has not been a 
Senator at any point during those two months.

There are always at least three Senators.  If at any point there is less 
than three Senators, the registered player, who is not a Senator, and 
who has not been a Senator for the longest period of time amongst the 
registered players, becomes a Senator.  If it is impossible to tell 
which player has not been a Senator for the longest period of time, then 
all players, who arguable share the longest period of time not being a 
Senator, become Senators.

Any Senator may choose to remove themselves from the Senate, by stating 
so in a public forum.



Create a new rule titled "Senator Suggestions" with the following title:

A Senate Suggestion is a piece of text sent to a public forum by a 
Senator.  It must state clearly that it is a Senate Suggestion and 
contain a valid Suggestion, or it fails to be a Senate Suggestion.

Only Senators may make Senate Suggestions.  Senate Suggestions may be 
made only as defined by the rules.  A Senate must contain all the 
information needed, as defined by the rules, or it fails to be a Senate 
Suggestion.

Any Senator may object to a Senate Suggestion, by making a Senator 
Objection.  Senate Objections must be made in a public forum, making 
clear the suggestion they object to, and that in fact the text is a 
Senator Objection.



Create a new rule titled "Senate Powers" with the following text:

A Senator may make a Senate Suggestion, that a registered player becomes 
a Senator.  To do so there must be a clear indication of the intended 
player in the Suggestion.  The player becomes a Senator one week after 
the suggestion, unless there is a Senator Objection to the suggestion 
within the week.

A Senator may make a Senate Suggestion, that a Senator is removed from 
the Senate.  To do so there must be a clear indication of the intended 
Senator in the Suggestion.  The Senator is removed from the Senate one 
week after the suggestion, unless there are at least 2 Senator 
Objections to the suggestion within the week.



Create a rule titled "Senate Proposals" with the following text:

At any time during a Proposal's Voting Period, a Senator may make it a 
Senate Proposal, by stating so in the Public Forum.  If that does not 
happen, the Proposal is not a Senate Proposal.  

A Senator may object to the proposal becoming a Senate Proposal by 
stating so in the public forum during the Proposal’s Voting Period, in 
which case the proposal ceases to be a Senate Proposal, and returns to 
its previous state.

If a Senator objects to a proposal Senate Proposal, that Proposal may 
not become a Senate proposal again.

Entities other than Senators cannot vote on Senate Proposals. If an 
Entity other than a Senator has already voted on a Proposal by the time 
it becomes a Senate Proposal, eir votes on that Proposal are cancelled, 
these votes remain canceled even if the Proposal reverts from being a 
Senate Proposal.

The vacation of satisfied P-Note Payment Orders #62 and #63 requires
that the following Reversing Orders be made:

[PR2061.01] The Repeal-O-Matic is ordered to pay to the Bank 1 P-Note.
[PR2061.02] The Repeal-O-Matic is ordered to pay to the Bank 1 P-Note.

The Notary is advised that the Repeal-O-Matic is an entity which
possesses Currencies and which does not have an Executor.  (Oops.)

Macross is again cited for Persistent Indebtedness in P-Notes (for order
PR2032.03).

[PR2061.03] Macross is ordered to pay to the Bank 1 Indulgence.

The Promotor confirms that Andre possessed no P-Notes at the time of
eir deregistration.
