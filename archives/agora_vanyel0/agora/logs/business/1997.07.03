Harlequin, how do you interpret "VT income" exactly?

Hurray! Will democracy finally reconquer Agora?

To join the Democratic Movement, just pay the Contest Fee of 0 P-Notes.

This is also an official announcement to the Notary that regulations
1 and 3 have been slightly amended. The new (complete) Regulations are
reproduced below.

Andre

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 0. The name of the Organization is 'Democratic Movement'. It is of the Class
    Contest.

 1. The purpose of the Democratic Movement is to improve the democratic Content
    of Agora Nomic in general, and the adherence to the 'One man, one 
    vote'-principle in particular.

 2. The Democratic Movement tries to erect a Group to get closer to these
    goals. However, Contestants of the Democratic Movement are not forced
    by these Regulations to become Foundors or Members of this Group.

 3. The Contest Fee is 0 P-Notes.

 4. The Administrator can at any time resign, provided e appoints a willing
    Contestant as eir Replacement.

 5. Any Contestant can at any time call an Internal Vote on changing the
    Regulations. This is done by sending a message to all other Contestants,
    which must clearly indicate an Internal Vote is started on changing the
    Regulations, as well as the change that is to be voted upon.

 6. Any Contestant can at any time call an Internal Vote on replacing the
    Administrator. This is done by sending a message to all other Contestants,
    which must clearly indicate an Internal Vote is started on replacing the
    Administrator, as well as the person, who needs to be a Contestant, who
    is voted upon to replace em. If that person votes AGAINST, the vote
    automatically fails.

 7. Any Contestant can at any time call an Internal Vote on using or
    transferring any Currencies in the Contest's treasury in some way. This 
    is done by sending a message to all other Contestants, which must clearly 
    indicate an Internal Vote is started on using or transferring Currencies, 
    which Currencies and the amount of them are to be used or transferred, 
    and the way they are to be used or the Treasury they are to be transferred
    to. If such a vote succeeds, the Administrator shall be responsible for
    using or transferring the Currencies in the way specified with the vote, 
    unless there is not enough of the Currency in the Contest's Treasury, or
    the Rules do not allow such a transfer or usage.

 8. An internal vote has a voting period of 7 days, or until all Contestants
    have voted, whichever is shorter. All votes must be cast by sending a 
    message to all other Contestants indicating the Proposal voted upon and 
    the vote casted. Only Contestants can vote. Votes can be any of 'FOR', 
    'ABSTAIN' and 'AGAINST'. The vote succeeds if and only if it meets quorum 
    and there are more 'FOR' than 'AGAINST'-votes. This Regulation defers to 
    all other Regulations.

 9. A vote meets quorum if and only if at least 2 Contestants vote, or both
    1 Contestant votes and the total number of Contestants does not exceed 2.

10. Any Contestant may at any time leave the Contest. Any change in or repeal
    of this Regulation is delayed until 1 week after posting of a message to 
    the Agora Public Forum notifying that the Regulation has been changed or
    repealed.

I claim that this is in error, in that I also transferred
