This post contains a number of Claims of Error, adressed to the
Herald but arising as a result of the actions of various Officers
having in the past submitted Payment Orders in Indulgences. The
Officers concerned are the Herald, CotC, Registrar, and Assessor. It
may be helpful to the Herald to consult the list of messages appended
hereto, which are relevant excerpts of the messages from which eir
errors arose.

I hereby claim that the latest Herald's Report errs in reporting 
POI003 as a legal Payment Order.

The message referenced in the Herald's Report as being constitutive
of this Payment Order appears on closer examination to be merely a
report of an Infraction, containing no language explicitly commanding
Blob to transfer any Currencies to the Bank, and is therefore not a 
Payment Order.

I hereby claim that the latest Herald's Report errs in reporting
POI004 as a legal Payment Order, for the same reasons.

I hereby claim that the latest Herald's Report errs in reporting
POI004 as a legal Payment Order.

This putative PO results from Elde's possession of Fugitive Blots at
the time of eir reregistration, but incorrectly lists the amount
thereof as 13, when it should have been 9 by reason of the errors
pointed out above.

I hereby claim that the latest Herald's Report errs in reporting 
POI007 as a legal Payment Order.

This putative PO results from a supposed Infraction committed by
Blob, reported by Registrar Steve in a message dated Aug. 4 ("BUS: 
Blob fails to Report". The message referenced in the Herald's Report 
as being a Payment Order for penalties incurred as a result of this 
Infraction was posted Aug. 5 by Steve ("BUS: Payment Orders for 
Blob"), in contravention to Rule 1504's requirement that penalties 
for Infractions be applied immediately upon their report. Neither 
message is consequently a vaid Payment Order pursuant to the 
incursion of a penalty for an Infraction.

I hereby claim that the latest Herald's Report errs in reporting
POI011 as a legal Payment Order.

This putative PO results from Blob's possession of Fugitive Blots at
the time of eir reregistration, which by reason of the above errors
had no legal cause to be reported, Blob having deregistered with no
legal Blots (or an amount of Blots different from that reported).

I hereby claim that the latest Herald's Report errs in reporting
POI012 as a legal Payment Order.

This putative PO was issued by the Assessor as a result of Blob's
Persistent Indebtedness in VTs, pursuant to a PO issued by Registrar
Steve for the same reasons as POI007, and under the same
circumstances, i.e. illegally. This PO is therefore illegal. Please 
note that this PO having been Satisfied by Blob, it must, when 
Vacated, be compensated by a PO of the same amount from the Bank.

I hereby claim that the latest Herald's Report errs in reporting
POI015 and POI??? as legal Payment Orders.

Both putative POs were submitted as a result of Elde's and Blob's,
respectively, committing the Infraction of Persistent Indebtedness,
but name as Payors Elde and Blob rather than their respective 
Executors.

I hereby claim that the latest Herald's Report errs in reporting
POI030 as a legal Payment Order.

This putative PO results from Blob's supposed Persistent
Indebtedness, however at this time Blob had no Blots, by reason of
the above errors.

Lastly, I claim that the inclusion in the latest Herald's Report of
a Payment Order naming Blob for Persistent Indebtedness is also
illegal as a consequence of all the above.

(Evidence : texts of referenced "PO" messages, or excerpts thereof.)

Crito is correct concerning my obligations. Therefore, I hereby,
somewhat hesitantly given the uncertainty over the relationship
between Blots and Indulgences, issue Payment Orders from Blob to the
Bank for the amounts of 2 Indulgences and 2 VTs.

Agora hereby submits the following Proposal for consideration and
vote:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Create a new rule with the text enclosed in ###:

###
InterNomic will try to vote on every proposal 96 hours before the
end of the voting period of the proposal. 

InterNomic's vote will be determined at the time InterNomic tries to
vote, according to the following rules:

i) If at the time InterNomic tries to vote more voting members of
Internomic have voted for the proposal than against it, InterNomic
will vote for the proposal.

ii) If at the time InterNomic tries to vote more voting members of
Internomic have voted against the proposal than for it, InterNomic
will vote against the proposal.

iii) If neither i) nor ii) applies, InterNomic will not vote on the
proposal. 

This vote from InterNomic is automatic. Its outcome shall be
determined by the moderator. This vote is a valid vote. 

The last two paragraphs of this rule take precedence over any other
rule concerning the validity of a vote.

###

Remarks: 

- Note that 309 (voting period ends before the full two weeks'
time if all nomics have voted) cannot stop InterNomic from voting. In
fact, at the moment, with InterNomic eligible to vote but not doing
so, the second sentence of 309 never applies at all.

- The last two paragraphs are needed because 332 does not make it
clear who will actually cast a valid vote (= "send a message to the
moderator" according to 207) for InterNomic.

- Note that the moderator is not "voting for" IN in any sense; it's
just that someone has to do it, and the moderator is the only one with
the necessary information. A choice or free will of the moderator is
not involved, however. 

- As a side effect, this will encourage IN member nomics to vote
early, so they can influence IN's vote.

In accordance with our Rules, Agora hereby votes AGAINST INP 346.

Some comments from our Voters:

-----
| I vote against Internomic Proposal 346.  Sounds
| like something the Ackas should handle themselves.
-----
| I vote AGAINST on the Referendum on this IN proposal, for the following
| reasons:
| 
| 1. 'forbidden from altering the Ackanomic game state in any way whatsoever'
|    is much too harsh
| 2. I don't think this Proposal will do what it wants to do: It cannot
|    change the Ackanomic Ruleset. It can put an obligation on Ackanomic
|    to change their ruleset, but it cannot do so itself.
-----
| I vote for INP 364. Personally, I think it is quite pointless, but I
| would still like to see what happens if it is accepted.

Amend Rule 1513 by adding this paragraph to the end:

Claim DENIED.  This PO was issued over a month ago, shortly after the PC
proposal passed.  I expressed my intentions at that time to treat such messages
leniently while people were getting used to PC.  No one objected at the time to
my treating a reference to a Blot as a reference to a PO.  The time to make
this claim was back when I asked how strict Player's wanted to be to start
with.  If you want this overturned, make a CFJ.

>I hereby claim that the latest Herald's Report errs in reporting

Claim DENIED, for the same reasons.

>I hereby claim that the latest Herald's Report errs in reporting
>POI004 as a legal Payment Order.

Claim DENIED.  I could be a stick in the mud here and point out that you have
incorrectly specified POI004 when you meant POI006, allowing me to deny the
claim on that basis alone.  However, it is clear to me that you meant POI006,
so I will deny the claim on the valid basis that I have denied the previous two
claims, making 13 the correct amount of Fugitive Blots.

Claim DENIED.  This one may have some merit, but it is an issue for the courts
to decide.  For my part, I note that R1504 includes that word "shall" again,
which seems to me to give the reporter some leeway in actually executing the PO
compared to applying the penalty, whatever that may mean these days.  To
overturn this one, make a CFJ and bar me from judgement.

Claim DENIED.  Since the previous claim was denied, this means the number of
Fugitive Blots reported was correct.

Claim DENIED.  First, since the previous, related claim was denied, this one
must be denied too.  However, for the record, I agree with Scott's
interpretation.  The Registrar's PO would have to have been in dispute at the
time of the Persistent Indebtedness Infraction in order for it to invalidate
this particular PO.

Claim DENIED.  This claim was already made and admitted by me at the time of
the report (which is why you are having trouble figuring out what the second PO
number should be).  At the time, I corrected the POs rather than vacating them
and issuing new ones.  This may be questionable, but the result is the same.  I
append the header to my corrected report here as evidence.  If you want a copy
with time stamps, let me know.

Claim DENIED.  Again, this required previous claims to have been admitted, and
would require a court decision that POs do not have to be disputed to avoid PI
Infractions.

Claim DENIED, as a consequence of all the above.

Morendil, do me a favor the next time you are going to dump a load of work on
me like this.  Do it at the beginning of the week, rather than at the end of
it.  Thanks.

H. CotC Andre!

In order to clarify the ambiguity in R1504, I hereby submit the
following Call for Judgement, barring Morendil:

Statement:

The provision in R1504 which states that:

      Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their
      legal report, and the Player making the report of the Infraction
      shall execute whatever Payment Order(s) are required to apply
      the penalty specified for that Infraction. 

should be interpreted such that penalties for Infractions are applied
immediately upon the legal report of the *penalties*, not the legal
report of the Infractions.

Argument:

I reproduce as my argument the one I gave for the same conclusion
in my Judgement of CFJ 937:

"It's worth commenting at this point on an ambiguity in R1504: it's
not clear whether the report of the Infraction and the report of the
gain in Blots have to be made in the same message, or whether the
report of gain in Blots can follow the report of the Infraction by up
to seven days. The first sentence [sic] of R1504 states that
"Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their legal
report". But the legal report of what: the penalties or the
infractions? If infractions is meant, R1504 is somewhat in tension
with itself, since it immediately goes on to imply (along with other
Rules, eg R1599) that the application of the penalty can be later
than the report of the Infraction. So I read R1504 as saying that
penalties for Infractions are applied at the time the penalty is
reported, which can be later than the time the Infraction is reported."

Requested Injunction:

I request that the Judge of the CFJ issue an Injunction requesting
the Rulekeepor to annotate R1504 with the statement and the list
of relevant Rules below, as e is permitted to do by R789.

Relevant Rules: 1504, 1599

Before anyone starts transferring Kudos away from me for not also
barring Crito, let me say that I made the CFJ before I had seen
Crito's message denying Morendil's Claims.
