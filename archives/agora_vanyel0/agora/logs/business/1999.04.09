Steve

This message contains exactly one Proposal.  The Proposal begins
immediately after the line marked "**START PROPOSAL" and ends after the 
line marked "**END PROPOSAL".

The following Proposal is to be titled "Cleanup of R.1006" and is to
have Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it resolved, that Rule 1006 be amended to read:

      (a) An Office is any position established by the Rules as such.

      (b) At any time, a given Office is held by exactly one Player.
          If an Office would otherwise not be held by any Player, it
          shall be held by the Speaker.

      (c) An Officer is any Player who holds an Office.

      (d) A given Office has whatever duties, responsibilities, and
          privileges that the Rules assign to it.

[Most of the rest of the current R.1006 is superfluous baggage.]

**END PROPOSAL

I hereby announce my intent to adopt the foregoing Proposal Without Objection.
