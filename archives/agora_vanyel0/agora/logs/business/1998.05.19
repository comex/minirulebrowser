Proto1: Make Plots functional
=============================

Rule changes:

Create a rule titled "Plots", with the text

      There is a class of entities called Plots.  All Plots are initially owned
      by the Bank.

      Each Plot has a unique name.  A Plot's owner may change its name Without
      Objection.


Create a rule titled "Adjacency", with the text

      Each Plot has a Longitude and Latitude, each of which is an integer.  Two
      Plots are Adjacent if and only if one of the following applies:

        * They have the same Longitude, and their Latitudes differ by one.
        * They have the same Latitude, and their Longitudes differ by one.


Create a rule titled "The Cartographor", with the text

      There is an Office of Cartographor. The Cartographor recieves a
      salary equal to 2 times the Basic Officer Salary.

      At least once each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall post a
      Report to the Public Forum containing the following information:

        * the name, ownership, and Adjacency of all Plots
        * the ownership, assignment (if any) and Type of all Structures
        * the ownership of all Ergs
        * all changes in ownership of Plots since the last Report
        * all changes in ownership, assignment, or Type of all Structures since
            the last Report
        * all Transfer Orders and Payment Orders specifying Ergs since the last
            Report

Amend the rule with the title "Maintenance of Structures" by replacing
the last paragraph with the following text:

      As soon as possible after the end of each month, the Cartographor
      shall bill each Player's Maintenance Fees for the past month to 
      that Player.

[Comment: I know that "Maintenance Fees for the past month" is a bit
vague, with Maintenance Fees defined as weekly payments. But I think
this is clear enough to work.]


Events to happen at the adoption of this proposal:

For each combination of Latitude (X) from 0 to 9 and Longitude (Y) from 0 to 9,
a Plot named "Area XY" (substituting the Latitude for "X" and the Longitude for
"Y") is created.


Proto2: Avoid inflation, encourage specialization
=================================================

Comment: With the adoption of "levers for monetary policy" I believe
wee will have everything needed to make a currency based economy
work. Some have remarked that at that point there is no real need for
plots. Certainly, they are not necessary to keep the game alive
because there are other sources of income - but these mostly exist for
officers only, now that we have abolished unemployment
benefits. 

Rather than reintroduce these, however, we might use Plots to
encourage specialization of players on a quite different level. If we
disallow plot ownership by officers, players will have two quite
different choices of how they can participate in the game: as
officers, with salaries paid by the state, or as private persons, who
own plots and are involved in economics. I'm not sure how exactly we
could implement such a separation, but here is a rough first sketch.


Create a rule with the title "Officers may not own plots" and the text: 

      If at any time a Player has held an Office in the normal fashion
      without interruption for more than two weeks, ownership of any Plots 
      this Player owned at that time is transferred to the bank. This
      transfer occurs even if other Rules do not allow it.

      As soon as possible after this transfer of ownership the Chancellor
      shall pay out to this Player Nationalization Damages of half
      the Market Value of all Plots transferred to the Bank, and 2 Ergs
      per Structure on these Plots.
