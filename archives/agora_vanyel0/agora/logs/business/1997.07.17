I Vote FOR this Proposal; it is flawed, but not fatally so.  (The Ambassador's
Report ought to include a list of all Openly Hostile nomics as well.)

I doubt it, but just in case:

If the above attempt to create a Transfer Order was unsuccessful, then I
order the creation of a Transfer Order for 1 VT from myself to the Order of
the Evil Eye.

If *that* attempt was also unsuccessful, then I transfer 1 VT from myself
to the Order of the Evil Eye, performing whatever actions are necessary
to do so.

Yes, at least some of us are enamored of complex and flowery language.  8)

In any case, H. Assessor take note, if my previous post submitting a Transfer
Order was ineffective, I hereby transfer 2 VTs from myself to the Order of the
Evil Eye, doing whatever it takes to do this.
