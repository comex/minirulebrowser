PROTO: Fix Proposal Numbering


This Proposal is to have AI=2.


Amend Rule 109 ("Proposal Numbers") to read:

      At the time e distributes it, the Promotor shall give each Proposal 
      a Number for reference.  The Number of a Proposal shall be the least 
      integer greater than all other Numbers previously assigned to a 
      Proposal (including numbers assigned to Proposals later determined 
      to have been incorrectly submitted), or 301, whichever is greater.

Amend Rule 1036 ("The Proposal Queue") by replacing the text reading:

      As soon as possible after the Promotor receives a new Proposal,
      e shall assign to it a Number as specified in other Rules.
      E shall then place this Proposal on the Proposal Queue.

With text reading:

      As soon as possible after the Promotor receives a new Proposal,
      e shall place this Proposal in the Proposal Queue.

Amend Rule 1753 ("Repeal-O-Matic") by replacing the text reading:

      For each Rule picked by the Promotor, the Repeal-O-Matic Rule
      shall submit a Proposal that consists of the following quoted
      text, with substitutions mandated by this Rule:

With text reading:

      For each Rule picked by the Promotor, e shall send a message
      to the Public Forum, acting as the Repeal-O-Matic's Executor,
      submitting a Proposal that consists of the following quoted
      text, with substitutions mandated by this Rule:

####

This is a simple fix that would change the time of Proposal numbering from
submission to distribution. It also makes a small change to the
Repeal-O-Matic rule that should fix the objection about the ROM making
proposals without actually sending a message. Any further suggestions?

Proto-Proposal:  Plots (v3.1)


[Part One:  Replace Locations with Plots]

Rename Rule 1706 ("Locations") to "Plots" and amend it to read:

      There is a class of entities called Plots.  All Plots are =
initially owned
      by the Bank.

      Each Plot has a unique name.  A Plot's owner may change its name =
Without
      Objection.

      Plots are not Locations; no Location shall become a Plot due to =
the
      adoption of the Proposal which enacted this Rule.  One second =
after this
      Rule is created, it shall amend itself by removing this paragraph.

Create a new Rule entitled "Buying and Selling Plots" with this text:

      A Plot's Market Value is a set of one or more options, each of =
which is
      some amount of a single Currency.  Any requirement to transfer =
some
      multiple of a Plot's Market Value may be satisfied by transferring =
that
      multiple (rounded down) of any of the options for that Plot's =
Market
      Value.

      The Market Value of a Plot is 5 VTs, 2 P-Notes, or 2 Indulgences, =
unless
      another Rule states otherwise.

      A Player may become the owner of a Bank-owned Plot by transferring =
the
      Market Value of that Plot to the Bank for the sole purpose of =
buying
      that Plot.

      A Plot's owner may transfer ownership of it to any other =
consenting
      entity, by informing the Cartographor that e wishes to do so.  For =
the
      purposes of this Rule, the Bank is always deemed to consent to =
such
      wishes.  Furthermore, as soon as possible after a Plot is =
transferred to
      the Bank in this way, the Cartographor shall pay out half the =
Plot's
      Market Value to the transferring entity.

Repeal Rule 1707 ("Movement").

Amend Rule 1708 ("Adjacency") to read:

      Each Plot has a Longitude and Latitude, each of which is an =
integer.  Two
      Plots are Adjacent if and only if one of the following applies:

        * They have the same Longitude, and their Latitudes differ by =
one.
        * They have the same Latitude, and their Longitudes differ by =
one.

Repeal Rule 1709 ("Distance").

[Rule 1710 ("The Cartographor") will be amended later.]


For each combination of Latitude (X) from 0 to 9 and Longitude (Y) from =
0 to 9,
a Plot named "Area XY" (substituting the Latitude for "X" and the =
Longitude for
"Y") is created.


Create a Rule entitled "Winning by Ownership" with this text:

      If at least one-third of all Plots are not owned by the Bank, and =
all
      Plots not owned by the Bank are owned by a single entity, then =
that
      entity's Executor satisfies a Win Condition known as a Win by =
Monopoly.

      Upon the correct report of such a Win, all Plots become Owned by =
the Bank.


[Part Two:  Define Structures and Ergs]

Create a Rule entitled "Structures" with this text:

      There exists a class of entities known as Structures.  All =
Structures are
      initially owned by the Bank.

      Each Structure is either assigned to a specific Plot, or =
unassigned.  All
      Structures are initially unassigned.

      An unassigned Structure's owner may assign it to a Plot by =
informing the
      Cartographor that e does so, unless another Structure is already =
assigned
      to that Plot.

      An assigned Structure's owner may make it unassigned by informing =
the
      Cartographor that e does so.  The owner of a Plot with a Structure
      assigned to it may also make that Structure unassigned by =
informing the
      Cartographor that e does so.

Create a Rule entitled "Ergs" with this text:

      Ergs are a Currency.  Their MUQ is 1.  Their Recordkeepor is the
      Cartographor.  Their Mintor is the Bank.

100 Structures and 10,000 Ergs are created in the Bank's possession.

Amend Rule 1677 ("Currency Awards for New Players") to read:

      As soon as possible after the start of a Player's Grace Period, =
the
      Registrar shall pay out 5 Voting Tokens, 5 P-Notes, and 15 Ergs to =
that
      Player.  In addition, e shall order the Cartographor to create 5
      Structures and give them to the Player; the Cartographor shall do =
so as
      soon as possible after being so ordered.

Amend Rule 1701 ("Proposal Notes") by removing this paragraph:

      Whenever there exists a Player who has never before possessed
      any P-Notes, the Promotor shall pay out 5 P-Notes to that Player.

Create a Rule with this text:

      Upon the creation of this Rule, all Voting Tokens and P-Notes are
      destroyed; all Payment Orders for Voting Tokens or P-Notes are
      vacated; and, for each Player, 5 VTs, 5 P-Notes, and 15 Ergs are
      created in that Player's possession.  One second after that, this
      Rule shall be repealed.


[Part Three:  Make Structures useful]

Create a Rule entitled "Types of Structures" with this text:

      All Structures have a Type.  All Structures are initially Idle, =
and any
      unassigned Structures become Idle if they are not already Idle.

      An assigned Structure's owner may change its Type by informing the
      Cartographor and paying the new Type's price to the Bank (if the =
new Type
      is defined by the Rules) or the Maintainer of the new Type's =
Blueprint
      (otherwise).

      As soon as possible after a Structure's Type changes, the =
Cartographor
      shall execute a Payment Order for half the old Type's price =
(rounded down)
      to the Structure's owner, from the Bank (if the old Type is =
defined by the
      Rules) or the Maintainer of the old Type's Blueprint (otherwise).

Create a rule titled "Maintenance of Structures" with this text:

      Each Structure has a Maintenance Fee that becomes due at the =
beginning of
      each month.  When due, the Maintenance Fee for a Structure is paid =
when an
      entity successfully executes a Transfer Order for the amount of =
that
      Structure's Maintenance Fee, provided that e indicates clearly =
that the
      Transfer Order is being executed to pay the Maintenance Fee for =
that
      Structure.

      One week after a Structure's Maintenance Fee becomes due, if it =
has not
      yet been paid, then it becomes delinquent.  As soon as possible =
after this
      happens, the Cartographor shall destroy that Structure.

Create a rule titled "Production of Structures" reading:

      As soon as possible after the beginning of the Nomic Week, the
      Cartographor shall report the Production of all Structures.

      When the Cartographor reports the Production of a Structure for a =
given
      Nomic Week, a number of units of the appropriate Currency are =
created in
      the possession of the owner of the Plot to which the Structure is
      assigned.

      Churches have no Production.  However, each Church is considered =
to be two
      players for the purpose of randomly allocating Indulgences, and =
any
      Indulgence that would otherwise be given to a Church is instead =
given to
      its owner.

      Only one Vatican may exist at any time, and it is always owned by =
the
      Bank.  Its Production is a number of Indulgences equal to the =
number of
      Blots issued and not vacated during the previous Nomic Week.

A Structure is assigned to Area 42 and becomes the Vatican.

Create a Rule entitled "Standard Types of Structures" with this text:

      A Type of Structure exists only if it is specifically defined in =
the Rules
      or in a Blueprint.

      The following Types of Structure exist, with the specified prices,
      Productions, and Maintenance Fees, unless otherwise specified:

        Type         Price      Production   Maintenance Fee
        ----------------------------------------------------
        Idle         none       none         none
        Farm         4 Ergs     1 VT         1 Erg
        House        4 Ergs     1 P-Note     1 Erg
        Mine         4 Ergs     1 Erg        1 Erg
        Church       4 Ergs     none         1 Erg
        Vatican      none       special      3 Ergs

Create a new Rule titled "Design of Blueprints" and this text:

      An SLC associated with a Currency not Minted by the Bank is known =
as a
      Blueprint.  A Blueprint indicates the properties of a Structure =
that
      produces units of the Currency associated with the Blueprint.  The
      Blueprint's Maintainer is the Mintor of the associated Currency.

      A Blueprint can only be created through an Application to Create a
      Blueprint. Such an Application must contain the following =
information:

        * The name of the Type of Structure defined by the Blueprint.
        * The type and amount of Currency produced by this Type.
        * Any changes to the amount of Currency produced by this Type =
due to its
            Adjacencies to other Structures.
        * The Price of this Type.
        * The Maintenance Fee of this Type.

      The Maintainer of a Blueprint may change its text by posting the =
changes
      to the Public Forum, and indicating what Blueprint is being =
changed. Such
      changes may only take effect if the new text of the Blueprint =
would still
      define each of the properties of the Type listed above.

[This allows multiple Blueprints per non-Rule-defined Currency.]

Create a new Rule titled "Interaction of Structures" and this text:

      Two Structures are Adjacent if and only if they are assigned to =
Adjacent
      Plots.

      A Farm's Production is increased by 0.5 VT for each House or =
Church to
      which it is Adjacent, and decreased by 0.5 VT for each Mine to =
which it is
      Adjacent.

      A House's Production is increased by 1 P-Note for every 2 Farms or =
Mines
      to which it is Adjacent.


[Part Four:  Remove other Currency inputs; make P-Notes useful]

Amend Rule 1471 ("Creation and Destruction of Currencies") by replacing =
the
text reading:

       New units of a Currency are created when the Mintor of that
       Currency transmits to the Recordkeepor of that Currency a notice
       that e is creating new units of that Currency, specifying the
       number of units that e is creating.  The newly created units are
       added to the Mintor's possessions.

with the text:

       New units of a Currency can only be created by an assigned
       Structure of the appropriate Type to produce that Currency,
       as described in other Rules.

Rename Rule 1763 ("Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank II") to =
"Intentional
Transfers to the Bank") and amend it to read:

       If an Entity transfers Currency to the Bank and specifies a
       purpose for this transfer, and the transfer succeeds in
       accomplishing that purpose, the Bank shall, as soon as possible,
       destroy that Currency.

[Rules 1754 ("Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank") and Rule 1763 =
currently have
  identical text.]

Repeal Rule 1684 ("VT Supply").

Amend Rule 1623 ("Disinterested Proposals") to read:

      A Proposal is Disinterested if it is clearly labelled as such by =
its
      Proposer.  If a Proposal is not Disinterested, it is Interested.

Amend Rule 1753 ("Repeal-O-Matic") by replacing "submitted its Proposal
concerning a given Rule" with "submitted its Proposal concerning a given =
Rule,
and paid the Petition Fee for that Proposal,".

Amend Rule 833 ("Awards & Penalties for Proposals") to read:

      As soon as possible after the beginning of the Nomic Week, the =
Assessor
      shall pay out two Voting Tokens to each Player who submitted a =
Proposal
      which was adopted during the previous Week.

Amend Rule 1702 ("Petition Fee for Proposals") by appending this =
paragraph:

      All Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, no Proposal shall be =
adopted
      unless its Proposal Fee is paid by the end of its voting period.


[Part Five:  Amend the Rule defining the Cartographor and eir duties]

Amend Rule 1710 ("The Cartographor") to read:

      There is an Office of Cartographor. The Cartographor recieves a
      salary equal to 2 times the Basic Officer Salary.

      At least once each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall post a
      Report to the Public Forum containing the following information:

        * the name, ownership, and Adjacency of all Plots
        * the ownership, assignment (if any) and Type of all Structures
        * the ownership of all Ergs
        * all changes in ownership of Plots since the last Report
        * all changes in ownership, assignment, or Type of all =
Structures since
            the last Report
        * all Transfer Orders and Payment Orders specifying Ergs since =
the last
            Report


[Part Six:  Clean up other references to Locations]

Amend Rule 869 ("Registered Players") by removing the following =
paragraph:

      When a Player registers, eir Location is the Welcoming Center.

Amend Rule 1016 ("Putting Oneself On Hold") by replacing "Moves to the =
Stasis
Chamber" with "says so in the Public Forum", and by replacing "Moves =
from the
Stasis Chamber" with "says so in the Public Forum".

Amend Rule 1664 ("Rebellion") by removing the text "whose Location is =
the Beer
Hall".

Amend Rule 1367 ("Degrees") by adding this paragraph:

      "Granting a Degree" and "awarding a Degree" are synonymous.  A =
Player who
      has been awarded a Degree possesses that Degree.

Repeal Rule 1711 ("Accepting Degrees").

A Silly Proposal

As this week's Silly Person, I submit the following Silly Proposal (taking a
break from poetry), paying 1 P-Note to advance its priority to one.  I also
designate Kolja A. as next week's Silly Person.

########
Silly Proposal
Cantus Cygneus

Create a Rule with the following text:

      Whenever a Player feels that e has been treated so egregiously by
      the Agoran community that e can no longer abide to be a part of it,
      e may submit a document to the Clerk of the Courts, clearly labeled
      a Cantus Cygneus, detailing eir grievances and expressing eir
      reproach for those who ey feel have treated em so badly.

      As soon as possible after receiving a Cantus Cygneus, the Clerk of
      the Courts shall post this document to the Public Forum along with a
      Writ of Fugere Agorae Grandissima Exprobratione, commanding the
      Player to be deregistered and instructing the Registrar to note
      the method of deregistration for that Player in subsequent
      Registrar Reports, as long as the Player remains deregistered.

      The Player is deregistered as of the posting of the Writ, and the
      notation in the Registrar's Report will ensure that, henceforth,
      all may know said Player deregistered in a Writ of FAGE.

No problem; we can still debate whether it was a Silly Proposal or 
not at the time of its being posted. Actually, since you have not 
posted these results yet, the best way to go about it is...

H. CotC, I hereby Call for Judgement on the following Statement :

---
The Proposal submitted by Crito with title Cantus Cygneus, claimed
to be a Silly Proposal, is not, in fact, a Silly Proposal.
---
R&A : firstly, I contend that Crito's pun, while able to elicit a 
brief groan, is not "truly hideous". Secondly, I submit that the 
Proposal *contains* a pun, but does not, as a whole, *consist of* a 
pun, as required by the Silly Proposal Rule.
