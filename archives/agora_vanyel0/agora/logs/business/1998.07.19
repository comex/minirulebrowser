I remind all players that the period of delegation of the Assessorship
has now ended, and Steve is once again Assessor.  Send Proposal
votes to Steve.

Steve, as I am no longer vote collector for Proposals, I am also
not authorized to detect and report Murphy's infraction of 
public voting.  That is now up to you.

H. Ambassador Kolja,

I hereby submit the following InterNomic Proposal:

####
InterNomic Proposal
When Nomics Default on Judging

Be it herweby resolved that R213 be amended to read:

      A nomic which has been selected to judge must deliver judgement
      within two weeks by sending its judgement to the moderator, who
      must then distribute the judgement to all members.  A legal
      judgement is either "true" or "false", and must be in accordance
      with the rules.

      If a nomic fails to deliver judgement, then it is removed as
      judge, and the moderator shall select a new judge from among the
      other eligible nomics.

####
