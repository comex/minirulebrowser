COE: The number of this CFJ is 1066, not 1066.

COE admitted. The corrected part reads:

======================================================================

                               CFJ 1066

"The Office of Speaker-Elect is not now being held in the normal fashion."

Steve points out that while I cannot delegate, I
can resign.  Thanks for pointing that out,
Steve.

So, to get this damn Currency crisis resolved, I
hereby resign from the Office of Herald,
appointing Morendil as my successor.

Morendil, the Indulgence POs that need vacating
are POI001 through POI273, with the exception of
POI127 and POI130.  These last two were vacated
previously for other, valid reasons.  You might
want to add a disclaimer about the existence of
such POs, just in case I missed a number or two
within that range.

Thank you.

Dear Nomic Players,
   I am considering joining the game.
Please send details.  In particular,
how does a Player differ from a
"Watcher"?

Also, how much time does it take per
week to play Nomic?

Basically, a Player is allowed to vote, hold Office, make proposals and perform
various other actions described by the Rules as being allowed by Players.  To
become a Player, all you have to do is send a message to this list requesting
your registration in Agora - and let us know what name or nickname you would
like to use here.

You will need to subscribe to the agora-business
(Majordomo@gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au subscribe agora-business) and agora-official
(Majordomo@gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au subscribe agora-official) lists, as well as
the agora backup list (Majordomo@win.tue.nl subscribe agora).  These lists are
known collectively as the Public Forum (PF for short).

You will also probably want to subscribe to the discussion list
(Majordomo@gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au subscribe agora-discussion), although this
last is not a requirement.

>Also, how much time does it take per
>week to play Nomic?

It can suck up as much time as you've got.  8)

Much of the "play" is really discussion on the agora-discussion list.  This
seems to average about, oh, maybe 15 to 20 messages per day during the week. 
If you want to skip a lot of the discussion, you can probably participate
reasonably well by checking in on the Public Forum two or three times a week. 
That's my take on it.  Others may have a different experience or different
advice for you.

Anyway, hope you join us, and welcome!

PROTO: More Interesting Proposal Mechanisms

Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Proposal Applications}

     There is a type of Application known as an Proposal Application.  
     Such an Application is executed by submitting it to the Promotor.  
     This application takes effect when executed.  For a Proposal 
     Application to take effect it must;

       i) Indicate it is a Proposal Application
      ii) Include the text of a single Proposal, clearly indicated as 
          such.
     iii) Specify the non-player entity which the Rules shall deem to 
          have submitted the included Proposal.  This entity cannot be 
          an entity defined elsewhere in the Rules as a Proposing 
          Entity.
      iv) Include the signature of the Executor of the non-player entity 
          specified in iii) above. (A Proposal Application may never be 
          executed on behalf of an entity with no Executor.)
       v) Include the signature of at least one other Player.

     If all the above conditions are met, the Application will be 
     executed upon its receipt by the Promotor.  The effect of the 
     Application is to temporarily designate the non-Player entity 
     specified in the Application as a Proposing Entity, and to submit 
     the included Proposal on behalf of that entity.  For the purpose of 
     the Rules governing Proposals, the included Proposal shall be 
     deemed to have been submitted when the Application was executed.  
     Immediately after this submission, the entity will cease being a 
     Proposing Entity.  (Losing this designation will not change the 
     identity of the Proposer, it will remain the non-Player entity 
     specified in the Application.)

{Comment: This allows Groups, Contests, and any entity with an Executor
          to make a proposal.  I've always been interested in allowing
          the possibility of Groups to propose legislation.  This also
          allows an easier method for group authorship of Rules rather
          than direct fiddling with the Attributions.  All you need is
          to create a contest called "Me & Him Inc." and submit your
          Proposal Application.}

Now let's see if I can get this right...

I hereby indicate willingness to succeed Crito as Herald.

I hereby vacate any Payment Orders in the range POI001 through
POI273, with the exception of POI127 and POI130, that Rule 1743 
requires to be vacated.

I hereby resign as Herald, appointing Crito to be my successor, if 
willing.

After the hand passed into temporarity, Harlequin's, of the previous (but
inferior) scientist of a considerable insanity, having had the experience,
previously, of HIMSELF being the Frankenstein Monster and so of a
deceitful nature leading him to participate in the murky business of
creating Zombies, a strong control is needed with these monsters running
around and around in Agora messing up the place, a true GENIUS, so it is
only expectable to my NOMINATION, HEREBY, for Mad Scientist. 

ONLY I have put forward Proposal the means necessary to rid Agora of these
Zombies' Masters once for all, although the weak Agorans show little power
to wanting fight the undead, how many Votes have appeared so far, 3, 4? 
When many more are needed, TOO BAD about Vir, sometimes there will be
unexpected outcomes of good intentions, and praise to Morendil, a Zombie
standing up for his LIBERATION! 

After, and I am greatly FOR, 3581 passes, we can get to a but
scientifically satisfying occult research - with the Frankenstein Monster.
Vote for ME as Mad Scientist. Otherwise, you'll be sorry. What kinds of
CREEPS might you not otherwise get?

And should it not pass, I think Agora has said WE WANT THE ZOMBIES, and
this should be respected - should it fail, I will put my support to the
cause of the Zombie masters, yes I would, and those who have conspired
with the Masters will be SORRY because they cannot get rid of them any
more, when they had the chance. Who am I, to throw away Proposal by
Proposal to the unwilling masses? And this is my PROMISE and ULTIMATUM.
And I hereby certify that no one has been part of to decide this
ultimatum, but MYSELF.

Yours in Scientifically Madness,
Ørjan.

Judgment: FALSE

Reasoning: Transfers must be from one entity to another. The only
definition of Entity I can find in the Rules is in Rule 1586, which
defines Nomic Entities as:

	"Nomic Entity" is any entity which has no discernible
      existence without the Rules, only existing by virtue of the
	Rules defining it to exist.  No two Nomic Entities
	(including Players) shall have the same name or nickname.

The above does not apply to the philosopher Plato nor, as far as I can
tell, to any other Plato either.

Now, it is possible that the "entity" referred to in the Transfer Rules
does not refer to Nomic entity. In this case, the term is undefined
(although we can tell that any Nomic entity is also an entity). If we
take the definition in my dictionary, an entiry is "Anything that exists
or
may be supposed to exist". Can Plato be "supposed to exist"?
I have my doubts, and I am not sure whether he would agree. Either way,
I am inclined to Judge FALSE. 

Vlad

>From the Assessor's Log:

| Date: Wed Oct 29 10:36:30 1997  Nomic Week: 226
| Executor: Zefram
| 
|   Zefram deregisters.
|   Transfer of 0.9 VT from Zefram to Rule 113 succeeds.
|   Transfer of 0.9 VT from Zefram to Vladimir Ashkenazy succeeds.
|   Transfer of 0.9 VT from Zefram to Benjohn Barnes succeeds.
|   Transfer of 0.9 VT from Zefram to the fyshbowl succeeds.
|   Transfer of 0.9 VT from Zefram to Larry Wall succeeds.
|   Transfer of 0.9 VT from Zefram to Screaming Lord Sutch succeeds.
|   Transfer of 19.1 VTs from Zefram to Peter Suber succeeds.

The Assessor finds that, in his best understanding of recent
Judgements, that Rule 113 and the fyshbowl are not entities capable of
possessing Currencies, but that Vladimir Ashkenazy, Benjohn Barnes,
Larry Wall, Screaming Lord Sutch, and Peter Suber are.  Therefore, the
transfers to Rule 113 and the fyshbowl are struck as improperly
apprehended, and the transfer to Peter Suber is thus improperly
reported; the correct amount being, I believe, 20.9 VTs.
