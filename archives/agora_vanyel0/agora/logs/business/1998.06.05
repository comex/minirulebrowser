I hereby vote for 3749 and 3754. I urge other players to declare 
Presence on 3754, so that it may pass. Even if Plot Repair passes,
Plots are not going to be working for a while yet, and non-Officers
need some income in the meantime. And even when we get it working, 
I think we should retain unemployment benefits for players who are
neither Officers nor Land-holders, as a least-committment level of play.

I think this is a somewhat redundant proposal, so for a start I'll
just declare presence on it. However, it would be nice if those who
have an opinion about this proposal express it by voting, and if
others support our IN activity by declaring presence, too.

OFF: New IN proposal

I declare presence on INP378.

-- Crito

>>> Klaus Herrmanns <klaush@tp3.ruhr-uni-bochum.de> 06/05/98 06:30am >>>
Hi all,

The following IN proposal was distributed. Our Agora referendum on
this will run for one week.

>>
INP 378
submitted bu Macronomic


	Create the following new rule:
	Any liaison may request a survey by informing all liaisons of the
question they wish to ask.  That liaison then becomes the administrator for
the survey.  The liaison for every member nomic wishing to participate in
the survey  should give the administrator a list of the e-mail addresses
for all players in that nomic who will participate in the survey within one
week.  The administrator should ask each of those players the survey
question, counting a player once even if the are members of multiple
nomics.  One week after players have been asked, the administrator should
inform all liaisons of the results of the survey, however they may not
include the names of the respondents.
<<

BTW, could someone send me a copy of my last Ambassador's report? I
seem to have lost mine. Thanks!

My first reaction to that proposal when I saw it was that it
permits what is already permitted.  I have half a mind to rewrite it
and propose it from Agora, except that I also don't see the point of
the legislation at all.

My vote is AGAINST, unless I have to pay to vote in INP Referenda, in
which case I cast no vote.
