This COE is admitted in part and denied in part.

I admit that the report as published did not count your Votes on 342
thru 345.  However, the report as published did count your votes on
339 through 341, and the report as published made no claim regarding
your votes on 324 through 338.  Therefore, your COE is admitted with
respect to INPs 342 through 345, and denied with respect to INPs 324
through 341.

The previous report is amended to reflect that Morendil voted AGAINST
INPs 342, 343, 344, and 345.  Further, as a consequence, Agora will
vote AGAINST INP 344.
