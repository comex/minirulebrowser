I return from a short trip to discover that, evidently, I am now
permanently ineligible from ever judging another CFJ again. Eeek.

Anyway: any Player who has had a bug-fix proposal fail recently, please
send them to me. I will assemble them all together, pay to raise the
proposal's Priority, and vote for it. OK?

I just realised that as Accountor, I am not supposed to blithely delete
messages like Michael's. This is against my habit, and I haven't been
paying the attention to these things that I ought to. Sorry. 

If anyone has recently made a PO or a TO for VTs, which hasn't been 
reported yet, would they please forward me a copy for informational
purposes?

I hereby vacate those payment orders issued by me as aaa261-aaa275.
Since I was not Assessor, I did not have the authority to issue
such orders.
