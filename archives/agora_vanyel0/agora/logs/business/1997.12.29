I claim that I do not owe the Bank a P-note, based on the argument I
used in the recent CFJ that elJefe dismissed.  Basically, my
disinterested proposal did not have a Sponsor, so the rule which
sought to fine me did not apply.  (FWIW, elJefe agreed with me but
felt he had to dismiss the CFJ because it was poorly worded.)

If you feel this is sufficiently weighty to require a CFJ (one better
worded with any luck), I will do this but you could just accept the
COE. :-)

Michael.

BUS: COE on recent Herald's and Promotor's reports

Michael begs:

>used in the recent CFJ that elJefe dismissed.  Basically, my
>disinterested proposal did not have a Sponsor, so the rule which
>sought to fine me did not apply.  (FWIW, elJefe agreed with me but

Hmm.  I think it's a little more complicated than this, unfortunately, if not
particularly weighty 8).  Before I admit or deny this claim, can you show me a
message that indicates the Assessor admitted a claim of error that the PO
issued by em was invalid and not legally issued (or get em to do that) or show
me a message that indicates the PO was vacated?  I can't find any such messages
in my archives, but I could easily have missed a COE admission (it's unlikely
that I would have missed a PO vacation).

If you can do that, then I can go ahead and admit your claim.  Otherwise, I
will have to say that the PO exists as issued by the Assessor and is subject to
Persistent Indebtedness (officially, there is no current dispute regarding this
PO).  If this is not possible, then I will have to deny your claim.  Of course,
sending a properly worded CFJ to the Courts at that point would put it in
dispute and remove the possibility of any further PI Infractions while the
matter is pending.

Your welcome.  And I guess now I had better officially deny this COE.  Ok, so
this COE is hereby denied.  8)

Proto-Proposal
Curb VT Supply

Be it hereby resolved that R1684 be amended to read:

      When the last Voting Period on a Proposal distributed in a given
      Nomic Week ends, and if at that time there are less than 200
      Voting Tokens in existence not possessed by the Bank, then the
      Assessor shall pay out to each each Player who cast a vote on
      any Proposal distributed during that Nomic Week 2/3 as many
      Voting Tokens as there were Proposals distributed in that Week
      (rounded down to the nearest integer), or 8 Voting Tokens,
      whichever is less.

Opposed.  This fails to scale for the number of Players (if we have 25
Players, that only allows for 8 VTs each, which is not many at all).
In addition, the determination of whether or not to issue the Orders
will be somewhat onerous, and will become even more so should we
divorce Proposal Vote Collecting from VT Recordkeeping.  Issues of
uncertainty in Currency holdings may also cause problems.  Finally,
the number of Voting Tokens not held by the Bank is subject to a
substantial degree of manipulation by the payors of outstanding
Payment Orders, especially the Bank.  (The Bank just paid out 315.5
VTs in Payment Orders.)
