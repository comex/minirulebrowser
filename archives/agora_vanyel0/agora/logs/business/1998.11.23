[H. Promotor, please note that this mail contains work for you]


I supported Scott's proposal to end our involvement in IN. However, in
addition I believe that the remaining aspects of the Ambassador's
office are very few, and I don't see what this office is good for
now. 

I know that there are still a few duties for the Ambassador: "seek out
foreign nomics, and conduct diplomatic relations with Friendly
nomics". However, to be honest, I've rarely done that in the past, and
don't intend to do it more intensively in the future. So far I had no
bad conscience because of this - while IN was alive there were other
things to do, and I considered my unopposed reelections as an
indication that Agorans were content with my work. But now what
remains is a job I don't find interesting, and a classical white
elephant (the friendly/neutral/enemy status stuff).

I would prefer to just kill the elephant and start over again should
the issue if inter-nomic relations come up again later. Therefore, I
hereby step back from the office of Ambassador. If there are others
who think the present job description of the Ambassador is
interesting, well, I'll happily support your bid for the office. If
you're in it for the money only, that's fine with me - you'll have to
wait until the BOS rises again, anyway ;)

To be consistent, I'd also like to give you a chance to express your
agreement with my more general point that the Ambassador's office is
not really needed at the moment. Therefore (H. Promotor, please note)
I hereby submit the following proposal, and transfer 2 P-notes from
myself to the bank to raise its priority by two:

>>
Post-IN cleanup

Repeal rules 1718, 1719 and 1866.

The Promotor is hereby requested and encouraged to increase the size
of the Weekly Proposal Batch.  There are now seven Proposals in the
Queue with nonzero priority.  With the current batch size, it will
take four weeks to clear these out, which in my opinion is too long.
Please increase the batch size to at least three, and preferably
four.  Thank you.

Unless I missed something, this should still be "Required to Serve."
I haven't proposed anything since I became Required to Serve.

Proposal Chuck120
Trombone Concerto

I request that this Proposal have AI=3.

Rule 955 is amended by appending a paragraph reading

      A Proposal may not have its Voting Index set except
      as described in this Rule.  A Proposal may not be adopted
      (synonymous with the Proposal passing) except as described
      in this Rule.

A Rule shall be created with Power=3 and text as follows:

      Except as described in this Rule, no entity can set the Power
      of another entity to exceed the Power of the entity causing
      the Power to be so set.  A Rule may set the Power of an adopted
      Proposal, even exceeding the Power of the Rule, so long as the
      Power of the adopted Proposal does not exceed the Voting Index
      of that Proposal.

      No entity may destroy or repeal an entity with Power greater
      than its own.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I transfer 1 P-Note to the Bank in order to increase the Priority of
the above Proposal by 1.

Chuck
