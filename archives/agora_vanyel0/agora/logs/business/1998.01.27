I am creating a new Currency. This Currency shall be known as Jester's
Ode Favores and shall have MUQ 0.5. I designate myself as Recordkeepor
for Jester's Ode Favores. Jester's Ode Favores may be redeemed (at my
discretion) for a beneficial act by myself. The act of redemption may be
referred to as 'Calling in a Favore'.

I am hereby minting 20 Jester's Ode Favores.

I hereby transfer 0.5 Jester's Ode Favores to Chuck.

(I may transfer a few more after I look back over my mail at the
kindnesses bestowed upon me thus far.)

Anybody else want to mint some Ode Favores ?

     THE AGORAN WEEKLY JOURNAL
     VOLUME 42, ISSUE 17
     Monday edition
     January 26, 1998


PROPOSALS
---------

1/21  Murphy Proposes "Plots", and protoes (and later re-protoes)
        "Who's In Probate".

      Oerjan protoes "Limit Rewards Not Wins".

1/22  Steve protoes "Changing Nomic Properties", intended to prevent
        all such changes not triggered by some Player action.

      General Chaos re-protoes "The Omnibus Reform Act of 1998".

      Murphy protoes "Yet Another Probate Fix", which would fix some
        lingering references to Executors in Probate.

      Morendil Proposes "One More Probate Fix", which would define
        a "terminal estate" as one that would be destroyed if Rule 1601
        didn't require it to go through Probate first.

      Voting on Proposals 3664-3669 ends.  The following are adopted:
        3664 [Steve]         Repeal VT Supply
        3665 [General Chaos] Synonymity
        3666 [General Chaos] Award Oerjan the Title of Exorcist
        3668 [Kolja A.]      ROM proposal readability

1/23  Steve protoes "Apologies and Appeals".

      elJefe protoes "Repeal Probate", which would actually just
        drastically simplify it:  the Notary transfers as much Currency
        to the Bank as possible, destroys the rest, and vacates any
        relevant Payment Orders.

1/26  elJefe protoes "Time Requirements".

      The Repeal-O-Matic Proposes to repeal Rule 1763 (Inadvertent
        Transfers to the Bank II)

1/27  Steve protoes "Block successive Revolts".

      BethMo notes that "Plots" forgot to specify that the payee of
        Maintenance Fees must be the Bank, and possibly allows
        Blueprints to produce Rule-defined Currencies.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1078 [Steve] Judgement:  TRUE
         1/06-08  Assigned to Blob, who Judges TRUE
         1/08     Judgement and Injunction Appealed by Morendil
         1/09     Judgement Appealed by Crito
         1/10     Judgement published
                  Appeal of Injunction assigned to elJefe, General
                    Chaos, and Oerjan
         1/14-17  Injunction unanimously upheld
         1/22     Formal Apology submitted
         "Morendil violated Rule 1729 by voting on Proposal 3640 in the Public
          Forum."

CFJ 1080 [Blob]
         1/21  Assigned to Morendil, who proto-Judges FALSE
         "If the rules require that a player has to perform an action
          at a particular time, or during a particular time period, and
          e fails to do so, then e is not required to perform the
          action at a later time."

CFJ 1081 [Chuck]
         1/23  Assigned to Time Agent
         "Harlequin did not win the Game upon the conclusion of the
          voting period of Proposal 3640."

CFJ 1082 [Kolja A.]
         1/23  Assigned to General Chaos
         "Chuck incorrectly stated that Andre, Blob, Crito, ElJefe,
          General Chaos, Harlequin, Jester, Kolja A., Michael, Morendil,
          Murphy, Oerjan, Sherlock, Steve, Swann, & Time Agent were
          guilty of the Infraction of Delayed COE Response."


PROBATE
-------

1/21  elJefe implements eir Plan for Vanyel, then resigns as Vanyel's
        Trustee.

      Kolja A. implements eir Plan for Calabresi, then resigns as
        Calabresi's Trustee.

1/22  Notary Murphy clarifies some Probate and Trustee assignments.

1/23  Sherlock submits a Plan for ChrisM, Morendil objects, and
        Sherlock re-submits it (with clarification).

1/26  Morendil notes that Rule 1601 (Probate) fails to exclude
        satisfied, disputed, or vacated Payment Orders from the
        definition of "debt".


INTERNOMIC
----------

1/21  INP 360 [Ackanomic] "Gone Dotty"
      Amend Rule 215 by replacing the text "Ackanomic," with the text
        "Ackanomic, .Nomic,"

      INP 357 is rejected.

      MicroNomic II defaults on SFJ 12.  The rules of InterNomic do not
        provide for reassignment.

PROTO: Son of Frankenstein


Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: The Frankenstein Monster}

     This Rule is the Frankenstein Monster and can be referred to 
     unambiguously in that manner.  The Executor of the Frankenstein 
     Monster is the Mad Scientist.  The Frankenstein Monster is a 
     Proposing Entity.  The Frankenstein Monster is a Voting Entity.  
     The Frankenstein Monster is only permitted to vote on Proposals 
     that the Frankenstein Monster has proposed.  Votes cast by the
     Frankenstein Monster count toward Quorum.


Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: The Mad Scientist}

     There is an Office of Mad Scientst.  The Mad Scientist has the duty 
     of maintaining the Graveyard, and of acting on behalf of the 
     Frankenstien Monster.


Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: The Graveyard}

     The Mad Scientist shall keep and maintain a Record of the 
     Graveyard.  The Graveyard is a list of the texts of proposed and 
     repealed Rules.  Whenever a Rule is repealed from the Ruleset, or a 
     Proposed Rule fails to be adopted, the Mad Scientist has the option 
     of Burying that "Rule." (i.e. Adding the text of the Repealed Rule, 
     or the text of the Proposed Rule, to the Graveyard.)  If the
     Graveyard is empty, (ie. it lists no texts of any Repealed or
     Proposed Rules) then the Mad Scientist must Bury one "Rule" as soon
     as possible after a candidate is avalable.

     A "Rule" shall remain in the Graveyard until the Mad Scientist 
     selects it to be part of one of the Frankenstein Monster's 
     Proposals, at that time the text of that "Rule" shall be removed 
     from the Graveyard


Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: The Frankenstein Monster's Proposals}

     Once every week wherein the Graveyard is not empty, the Mad 
     Scientist Unearth a Rule. (ie. E shall select the text of a Buried 
     Rule.) This selected text shall be removed from the Graveyard and 
     become part of the Frankenstein Monster's Proposal for that week.

     The Proposal shall be for the creation of one Rule with the text of 
     the Unearthed Rule, with the following changes;

       i) The Mad Scientist shall select one noun (or noun phrase) and 
          replace every instance of that noun (or noun phrase) with the 
          words "Frakenstein Monster."  E shall also replace plural or 
          possessive instances of that noun (or noun phrase) with the 
          like form of the words "Frakenstein Monster."

      ii) The Mad Scientist shall select one verb and replace every 
          instance of that verb with another single verb of eir choice.  
          Again, various forms of the selected verb should be replaced 
          by the same form of the verb chosen by the Mad Scientist.

     iii) The Proposed Title for the new Rule must contain the words 
          "Frakenstein Monster."

      iv) The Proposed Power for the new Rule must be 1.

       v) Other aspects of the Proposal shall be at the Mad Scientist's 
          discretion.

     As soon as possible after all the above substitutions are made, the 
     Mad Scientist shall submit the Frankenstein Monster's Proposal to 
     the Promotor.

PROTO-PROPOSAL: The Return of Points.

     Preface: One of the things the economy needs is an encouragement 
     for people to spend the currencies that the game provides.  There 
     used to be an encouragement for both making Proposals, and for 
     Voting.  They were called Points, and could make you win the game.  
     The problem with points was that they became a currency (with the 
     EOG reset that caused a lot of bizarre transactions), they were
     anti-pragmatic with dozens of what Scott would term "automagical" 
     transfers, and they were linked to an End of Game event upon which 
     dozens of other events depended (Speaker Transition, Win Tokens, 
     Blots, re-registration) which meant uncertainties in points had a 
     cascade effect whenever a win was involved.  None of these problems 
     has anything to do with the concept of points themselves, they were 
     all problems with what the concept evolved into in the context of 
     Agora.

     This Proto is an effort to return a Scoring System to Agora, one 
     that is pragmatic and driven by Player actions.  There is some 
     analogy here with how currencies are currently handled, it also is 
     a small scale example of how I would like Officer Reports to be 
     handled eventually.  Please note, I purposely never define "points" 
     as an entity in and of themselves, this is to prevent Players from 
     arguing that the possibility of a negative Score is somehow 
     illogical, and to avoid all the BS involved in the creation and 
     destruction of something that shouldn't be an independent entity.


Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: Points and Scoring)

     Every Player has associated with em specific numerical value known 
     as their Score.  A Player's Score shall always be an integer.  If 
     the rules specify a non-integral change in a Player's Score, that 
     change shall be rounded to the nearest integer before being 
     applied.

     Only a Player can have a Score.

     Changes in a Player's Score can be referred to as a gain or loss of 
     Points.  A gain of some number of Points means that number is to be
     added to a Player's Score, a loss of some number of Points means 
     that number is to be subtracted from a Player's Score. In this 
     context, the term "Points" is only used to reference changes in a 
     Player's Score.

     This rule takes precedence over all other Rules dealing with Points 
     and Scoring.

{Comment: This is an attempt to initiate a Scoring system that does not 
          imply the treatment of Points as entities.  There's no talk of 
          transfers, creations or destructions.  "Points" as a term is 
          relegated to being a synonym for a Score change.
          v2: Added the requirement that only Players have Scores.}


Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: the Scorekeepor)

     There is an Office of Scorekeepor whose salary is twice the Basic 
     Officer Salary.  The Scorekeepor shall keep and maintain a record 
     of the current Scores of each Player.  The Scorekeepor's Official 
     Report shall include the Scores of every player, the changes in 
     those Scores since the last report, and the reasons for those 
     changes.  E shall publish this report in the Public Forum at least 
     once a week.

{Comment: Fairly straightforward.}


Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: Winning Scores)

     If any Player reaches a Score of 100 or more, then the Player who 
     has the highest Score and no win-preventing conditions is Eligible 
     to Win the game.  In the case of a tie for the highest such Score, 
     all such Players are Eligible to Win.

     Whenever a Player becomes Elgible to Win the Scorekeepor must
     announce this event in the Public Forum as soon as possible. 

     If no Endgame Procedure is underway at the time of this
     announcement, this announcement initiates an Endgame Procedure.

     If an Endgame Procedure is underway, and a Player becomes Eligible 
     to Win (because of a loss of a win-preventing condition) this does 
     not imply that any other Player loses an Eligibility to Win already
     granted by the Scorekeepor.

{Comment: When someone reaches 100 points, someone wins (not necessarily 
          the same someone)  there is probably some explanation needed 
          for the Endgame Procedure--  there should be a chance a) for 
          Players to challenge the announcement with a COE, and b) for 
          those with high scores to try and buy off win-preventing 
          conditions (i.e. Blots)
          v2: Split this and the next rule into a number of smaller,
          more unified rules about the Endgame, clarifying a few points
          and dealing with a few things (deregistering winners, and 
          appeals to challenged Endgames) better.}


Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Initiating an Endgame Procedure}

     When the Scorekeepor announces that there is a Player Eligible to 
     win, and there is no Endgame Procedure underway, then that
     announcement shall be the initiation of an Endgame Procedure.

     During an Endgame Procedure no Score changes shall be applied to 
     any Player.  All orders to change a Player's Score shall be 
     deferred until the termination of the Endgame Procedure.  This rule 
     takes precedence over Rules that would allow these changes to be 
     applied during the Endgame Procedure.

     An Endgame Procedure shall persist until it is terminated by the 
     Scorekeepor.

     An unchallenged Endgame Procedure shall be terminated one week from 
     the date of its initiation, unless the Rules require an earlier 
     termination.

{Comment: First of three rules dealing with events during the Endgame.}


Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: Challenging an Endgame Proceedure)

     When the Scorekeepor initiates an Endgame Procedure it is initially 
     unchallenged.

     An Endgame Procedure is challenged if any of the following occurs 
     while it persists;

       i) A COE alleges an error in the Scorekeepor's announcement that 
          affects a Player's Eligibility to Win.

      ii) A CFJ is being ruled upon that alleges an error in the 
          Scorekeepor's announcement that affects a Player's Eligibility 
          to Win.

     iii) An Appeal to a CFJ is being ruled upon where the matter at 
          issue is an allegation of an error in the Scorekeepor's 
          announcement that affects a Player's Eligibility to Win.

     If a challenge is resolved finding that no error existed, the 
     Scorekeepor shall make an announcement stating that the Endgame 
     Procedure is now unchallenged, the Endgame Procedure shall be 
     terminated four days from this annoucement, unless it is challenged 
     again.

     If a challenge is resolved finding an error did exist, then all
     Players Elgible to Win cease to be Elgible to Win and the 
     Endgame Procedure shall be immediately terminated without a winner.

{Comment: Twiddled with this a little so it is a little clearer how 
          challenges to a win are handled.}


Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Losing Elgiblity to Win}

     During an Endgame Procedure, if Player who is Eligible to Win 
     acquires a win-preventing condition, or ceases to be a Player, e 
     ceases to be Eligible to Win.

     If at any time during an Endgame Procedure there is no Player 
     Eligible to Win, the Procedure shall immediately terminate without 
     a winner.

{Comment: This was implied but not explicitly stated in the prior
          Proto.}


Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Termination of the Endgame Proceedure.}

     Whenever the Rules call for the termination of an Endgame 
     Procedure, the Scorekeepor shall announce this fact in the Public 
     Forum as soon as possible after it occurs.  Upon the Scorekeepor's 
     announcement, the Endgame Procedure shall conclude with the 
     following effects, in order;

       i) If there was no successful challenge to the Endgame Procedure, 
          and there are still Players Eligible to Win, then all Players'
          Scores shall be set to zero.  The Scorekeepor must order this
          change.

      ii) If there was no successful challenge to the Endgame Procedure, 
          and there are still Players Eligible to Win, then those 
          Players shall Win.  All such Players then cease to be Elgible
          to Win.

     iii) All score changes that were suspended during the Endgame 
          Proceedure shall be applied.

{Comment: Clarified some points about the suspended scoring, and made
          the actions of a terminating endgame more explicit.  The 
          ordering is to prevent an infinite loop for infinitesimal 
          fans.}


Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: Changing a Player's Score)

     A Player's Score is the Score reported by the Scorekeepor.  A 
     Player's Score changes only when the Scorekeepor records the 
     change.

     The Scorekeepor shall only record changes when a Player empowered 
     by the Rules to order such a change so orders eim. When the
     Scorekeepor is so ordered to make a change e must do so as soon as 
     possible.

     A Player's score is correct when it reflects all changes mandated 
     by the Rules and ordered by the appropriate Players.  A Player's 
     score is incorrect when it is in error, reflects changes that were 
     not ordered as mandated by the Rules, or fails to reflect a change 
     that was ordered as mandated by the Rules.

     A COE or CFJ can be issued alleging that a Player's score is 
     incorrect.  If such a CFJ or COE finds that the Score was 
     incorrect, then the Scorekeepor must order that Score to be changed 
     to the correct Score.

     If the Rules mandate a change in a Player's score, and do not 
     empower a Player to order that change, that change shall not be 
     included in any determination of a correct Score.

     The effect of ratifying the Scorekeepor's report is to render all 
     Scores listed in it as correct.

     This Rule takes precedence over any Rule that attempts to specify a 
     Player's Score.

{Comment: This is an attempt to have a completely pragmatic Officer's
          Report.  The Scores are what the Scorekeepor says they are.  
          (Another reason for the Endgame Procedure, the Scorekeepor can 
          illegally give someone a Score of 100, but then the Players 
          have a week to get a CFJ together, nullifying such a win.)}


Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: Ordering Changes in a Player's Score)

     When a Rule states that a Player's Score must change, and specifies
     a Player who is empowered order this change, that Player then must
     order the Scorekeepor to make this change as soon as possible after
     the Rules mandate the change. This order shall be a message to the
     Scorekeepor naming the Player subject to the Score change, the
     reason for the change, and specifying the magnitude of that change.

     A Player is empowered to issue such an order only if the Rules 
     specify e must order the change.

{Comment: This is partially lifted from the Currency Rules, but it's in
          a simpler form since there's no conceit about virtual tokens 
          running around being created and destroyed, going from Player 
          to Player or to the Bank and back.
          v2: Added language to have the order include the reason for
          the score change.}


Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: The Omnibus Scoring Rule)

     In any week that at least one Rule Change Proposed by a Player is 
     adopted, that Player shall gain three Points.  The Rulekeepor must 
     order this Score change.

     In any week where a Player Voted on more than three Proposals, e 
     gains three Points. The Assessor must order this Score change.

     Whenever a Player wins an Election, e shall gain five Points.  The 
     Vote Collector for the Election must order this Score change.

     Whenever a Player becomes Speaker, e shall gain three Points.  The 
     Registrar must order this Score change.

     Whenever a Player gains three style points for a Proposal, e shall 
     gain two Points.  The Wizard must order this Score change.

     Whenever a Player Judges a CFJ, e gains three Points.  The Clerk of 
     the Courts must order this Score change.

     Whenever a Player gains a Blot, e shall lose two Points.  The 
     Herald must order this Score change.

{Comment: I think it's easier on everyone to have a single Rule that
          lists what causes Score changes, rather than going around 
          amending half a dozen Rules. I also tried to keep it so there 
          was only one Score-Changing event per Officer.}

=====================================================================
BONUS PROTO: A "Point" Currency

Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: Point Tokens)

     There is a Currency known as Point Tokens (PTs), their Recordkeepor 
     is the Scorekeepor and their MUQ is one.

     Once a week the Scorekeepor must include in eir Official Report the 
     PT holdings of each entity that owns PTs.

     Possession of more than ten PTs is a win-preventing condition.

{Comment: One of the uses of Points were that they were another 
          inherently valuable currency, (Back when there were Points,
          EVs and Marks).  Unfortunately, that gave rise to a lot of the 
          problems that caused us to ditch Points.  Here is an attempt 
          to create a Score-Based Currency that's balanced enough to 
          prevent some of the things that destabilized Points-- and 
          without it directly tied to a Player's Score.}


Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: Effects of Transferring Point Tokens)

     When a Point Token is Transferred from the Bank to a Player, the 
     Player receiving the Point Token shall loose two Points.

     Whenever a Point Token is Transferred from a Player to an entity 
     other than the Bank, the Player losing the Point Token shall lose 
     two Points.

     Whenever a Point Token is Transferred to a Player from another 
     Player, the Player receiving the Point Token gains one Point.

     These Score changes shall occur when the transfer mandating them is 
     successfully completed.  These Score changes must be ordered by the 
     Scorekeepor.

{Comment: This is how PTs are tied to scoring.  It is a proxy way to
          transfer your points to someone else, two-for-one.  
          That meant that any PT you own is worth at least one point to 
          someone else.  They also don't suffer from the EOG reset, so 
          there shouldn't be mass cashing in, and it will make sense to 
          collect them despite the initial cost.  These things are 
          intended to help finagle a win, but it should be an 
          interesting win, since owning ten or more PTs is a win-
          preventing condition. . .}


Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: Getting PTs from the Bank)

     Any Player may Request a Point Token be paid to eim out of the 
     Bank.  Such a request is made by sending a message to the
     Scorekeepor requesting a Point Token from the Bank.

     To be sucessful, the Scorekeepor must dertermine that the following 
     is true of the Player making the request at the time the request 
     was made;

      i) The Player's Score is a positive number.

     ii) The Player has not received more than two PTs from the Bank in
         the prior week.

     If the Scorkeepor finds that the above conditions hold, then the 
     Player's request is successful.  Otherwise, the Player's request is
     not.

     The Scorekeepor must inform a Player as soon as possible after e
     finds eir request for a Point Token unsuccessful, and give the
     reasons the request was unsuccessful.

     The Scorekeepor shall pay out one Point Token to a Player as soon 
     as possible after e finds that Player's request successful.

{Comment: Gets PTs into circulation at a fairly controlled rate.  (You
          can't just order 200 of them.)}


Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: Winning and PTs)

     Whenever a Player Wins, the Scorekeepor shall bill that Player (all 
     winning Players) and the Player with the Highest Score (in the case 
     of tied Scores, all such Players are billed) for a number of Point 
     Tokens those Players possessed at the following time;

      i) The time immediately before the Win in the case of a Win that 
         did not happen at the conclusion of an Endgame Procedure.
     ii) The time the Endgame Procedure was initiated in the case of a 
         win coming at the conclusion of a Endgame Procedure.

{Comment: There needs to be a way to take PTs out of circulaion, so
          there's this minor EOG reset.}
