Marvellous. I hereby transfer 2 VTs to Harlequin.

That's one, and one to go. Who'll take advantage of this rare
opportunity to get paid to spend a P-Note? Two VTs are still
available, and could be yours!

Thank you, Harlequin.  8)

As Trustee for Jester's Estate, I announce the following plan:

Transfer 1 P-Note to Crito, as payment for Trustee services rendered.
Transfer 9.5 VTs to the Bank.

As Jester currently has no creditors or debtors, this will dispose of all
Jester's assets and complete the probate.

I see I shot too quickly and must object to my own
plan.  I find that Jester indeed has a Will,
leaving all eir assets to the newest Player who
has never previously been registered.  AFAICT,
this is Sherlock.  Therefore my new plan is to
transfer 1 P-Note and 9.5 VTs from Jester to
Sherlock.

Proposal: Lest we forget, fixing some loopholes. Trumpet Mk II.

Special Note:  There is no "scam" left in this proposal, Neither I or
               anyone else gains a whit from this. (Except a Patent
               Title denied me by a typo.)

Formatting Note:  The Rules created by this proposal are delimited by
"===" to help distinguish them.  The non-proposed Rule creations are
delimited by "***."  Instruments created by Rules are between quotes.


Let the following Rule be created (text delimited by "===")
{Title: The Trumpet};

===

     There is an instrument known as a Trumpet.  The only Trumpets that 
     may exist are those created by the Rules created by the Proposal
     that created this Rule.  All Trumpets have a Power of 4.  Trumpets 
     are bodies of text defined by the Rules.  Trumpets have an 
     initialization clause and a resolution clause.  Rule Changes (and 
     other effects) defined in the initialization Clause of a Trumpet 
     take effect immediately after the Rule Creating the Trumpet is 
     created.  Rule Changes (and other effects) defined in the 
     resolution clause of a Trumpet take effect at the time defined in 
     the text of the Trumpet, or immediately after the initialization 
     clause takes effect if such a time is unspecified.  A Rule defining 
     a Trumpet shall be repealed as soon as all provisions in the 
     Trumpet it defines have taken effect.

     This Rule shall repeal itself at 00:00:01 GMT on Aug. 1st 1998.

===

{Comment: Guess what?  Read the Ruleset Week paid off with a major
          loophole.  There is nothing to prevent a Power=1 Rule from 
          defining an instrument of arbitrary Power.  Proposals are 
          fairly well delimited, and Rules can't directly change Rules
          of higher power, but through this back door a Rule can define
          an instrument to alter any other Rule at its whim.  Ain't 
          this neat?  I've also noticed a few more loopholes
          to follow;) }


Let the following Rule be created (text delimited by "===")
{Title: What Bonus Clauses?}

===

     This Rule creates a Trumpet with the following quoted text;

     "Initialization Clause;
          Rule 1561 is repealed.

      Resolution clause (to take effect 24 hours after the adoption of
      the Proposal creating the Rule that created this Trumpet);

          The following Rule is created with a Power=2
          (text delimited by "***")
          {Title: Illegality of Bonus Clauses};

                ***

                Any Proposal which offers a bribe to a Player or Players 
                to vote in a specified manner, declare presence, not 
                vote, or buyback quorum on a Proposal (either itself or 
                another Proposal) shall be completely without effect, 
                even if it is adopted, any Rule to the contrary 
                notwithstanding.

                ***"

===

{Comment:  1561 is woefully out of date.  It only applies to bribes to
           vote FOR or AGAINST.  I'm surprised no one exploited this 
           when Presence was created.  It's perfectly legal to bribe 
           someone to not vote at all, or declare presence, or even
           ABSTAIN.}


Let the following Rule be created (text delimited by "===")
{Title: What Coercive Proposals?}

===

     This Rule creates a Trumpet with the following quoted text;

     "Initialization Clause;
          Rule 1003 is repealed.

      Resolution clause (to take effect 24 hours after the adoption of
      the Proposal creating the Rule that created this Trumpet);

          The following Rule is created with a Power=2
          (text delimited by "***")
          {Title: No Coercive Proposals};

               ***

               Proposals whose obvious and direct intent is to coerce a 
               Player or set of Players into voting, not voting,
               declaring presence, or buying back quorum against eir 
               conscience shall not take effect even if adopted, any 
               Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.
               
               ***"

===

{Comment:  Again, guess what, the current Rule only applies to coercing
           a vote, not a declaration of presence &c.}


Let the following Rule be created (text delimited by "===")
{Title: Slamming shut the back door.}

===

     This Rule creates a Trumpet with the following quoted text;

     "Initialization Clause;
           The following rule is created with an Power=3
           (text delimited by "***")
           {Title: What I get out of this.};

                ***

                Player Swann gains the Patent Title of "Loose Cannon."

                This Rule shall repeal itself at 00:00:00 GMT on Aug. 
                1st 1998.

                ***

      Resolution Clause (to take effect immediately before 00:00:00 GMT
      on Aug. 1st 1998) ;
      
          Let the following rule be created with an Power=3
          (text delimited by "***")
          {Title: Limits on the Power of Instruments};

               ***

               No instrument can create another instrument with a Power 
               greater than its own Power.  This Rule takes precedence 
               over any Rule that specifies the Power of the created
               instrument.  Proposals are explicitly exempt from this
               provision.

               In the specific case of Proposals, a Proposal shall have
               a Power equal to its Adoption Index.  In no case shall a
               Proposal take effect unless its Voting Index exceeds its
               Adoption Index, (or equals it in the case both equal
               Unanimity) and the Rules otherwise permit it to take
               effect.  A Proposal cannot create an instrument with a
               Power that exceeds the Proposal's Power.

               If an instrument creates another instrument, and fails to
               specify a legal Power for the created instrument, the 
               Power of the new instrument is 1.

               ***"
