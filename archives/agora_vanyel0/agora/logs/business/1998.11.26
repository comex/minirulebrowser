This message contains one or more Proposals.  Each Proposal begins
immediately after a line marked "**START PROPOSAL" and ends
immediately before the first following line marked "**END PROPOSAL".

The following Proposal is to be titled "Currencies" and is to have
Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1721 be amended to read:

      There shall exist the Office of Chancellor.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1467 be amended to read:

      (a) A Currency is any medium of exchange which has designated as
          a Currency in accordance with the Rules.

      (b) The designation of a medium of exchange as a Currency, and
          the cancellation of such designation, may be accomplished
          only by:
        (1) the operation of an Instrument with Power 1 or greater;
        (2) the Chancellor, Without Objection; or
        (3) Judicial Order, whenever the Rules so permit.

      (c) For the purposes of the Rules, units of a Currency are
          fungible and indivisible.

      (d) No tangible medium of exchange shall be designated as a
          Currency.

      (e) A Currency may be denominated such that a fraction of its
          primary denomination is its smallest indivisible unit, so
          long as there is a smallest indivisible unit.  When no other
          specification exists, the smallest indivisible unit of a
          Currency shall be one unit of its smallest denomination. 
          Amounts less than this smallest indivisible unit may be used
          in intermediate calculations; all such calculations shall be
          rounded off at the point that they are reduced to transfers,
          orders to transfer, or other finalized results of legal
          import.

      (f) The Chancellor shall retain and publish at least monthly a
          schedule, listing every medium of exchange designated as a
          Currency under this Rule.  This schedule shall include
          whatever information the Chancellor deems necessary, but at
          least the following information for each Currency:
        (1) the designated denomination or denominations of that
            Currency (and if more than one, the relationship between
            them);
        (2) the fraction of the smallest denomination of that Currency
            which is its smallest indivisible unit;
        (3) that Currency's Recordkeepor; and,
        (4) the Mintor or Mintors of that Currency, if any.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) The "Recordkeeper" of a Currency refers to the entity who
          has agreed to maintain a record of the ownership of the
          units of that Currency.  The Recordkeepor of an Currency is
          subject to the jurisdiction of these Rules.  Specifically, e
          shall:
        (1) maintain the abovementioned records in a manner consistent
            with these Rules, including the timely recordation of
            transfers of ownership made consistent with the Rules;
        (2) comply in a timely manner to all requests to produce those
            records as required by the Rules; and
        (3) perform all other duties which the Rules impose upon the
            Recordkeepor of a Currency.

      (b) A Currency may have any number of designated Mintors.  A
          Mintor may be designated for a Currency, or such designated
          cancelled, by:
        (1) the operation of an Instrument with Power 1 or greater; or
        (2) the Chancellor, Without Objection.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1598 be amended to read:

      Units of a Currency are transferred only when the Recordkeepor
      of that Currency receives a notice from the owner of one or more
      units of that Currency, specifying the units to be transferred
      and the entity who is to owner the units thus transferred.  The
      entity receiving the units thus transferred becomes their owner,
      and the Recordkeepor shall so note this on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1471 be amended to read:

      Units of a Currency are created only when the Recordkeepor of
      that Currency receives a notice from a designated Mintor of that
      Currency, specifying the number of units to be created and the
      entity who is to own the units so created.  The specified entity
      owns the units so created, and the Recordkeepor shall so note
      this on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      Units of a Currency are destroyed only when the Recordkeepor of
      that Currency receives a notice from the owner of one or more
      units of that Currency, specifying the units to be destroyed. 
      The Recordkeepor shall note this destruction on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1596 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever an entity becomes indebted to another for some
          amount of Currency, that entity indebted is required to
          transfer that amount of Currency to the entity indebted to
          within seven days.

      (b) A debt not paid within seven days is overdue.  Any entity to
          whom an overdue debt is due may assess a late penalty of not
          more than 25% of the overdue debt, and may do so repeatedly,
          not more than once every seven days after the debt becomes
          overdue.  Late penalties are added to the overdue debt.  An
          entity may elect to charge smaller late penalties, charge
          them less frequently, or forego late penalties altogether,
          at that entity's sole discretion.

      (c) If the validity of a debt, or any part thereof, is disputed
          by a Call for Judgement, that debt (or portion thereof) is
          not considered overdue, and does not accrue late penalties,
          while the dispute remains unsettled.

      (d) When an entity transfers units of Currency to another entity
          for the purpose of making a payment on debt, the receiving
          entity shall apply that payment to the nondisputed debts
          owed to em by the transferring entity, in order from oldest
          to newest.  A debt is paid when a transfer has been applied
          to it in this manner.  Any surplus will be retained by the
          receiving entity, to be applied to future debts or returned
          upon demand.

      (e) An entity may assume that any Currencies transferred to it
          to be payments on debts due to em, unless the transferree
          clearly indicates otherwise when making the transfer.

      (f) An entity who is owed an overdue debt may issue an Order
          requiring the entity who owes that debt to make payment by
          requiring a transfer of any amount up to the amount of the
          debt due, but only if no other Order currently in force
          requires the same entity to make payment on that same debt
          or any part thereof.  Such an Order shall be stayed (by the
          Clerk of the Courts) if the debt in question is subsequently
          disputed, and vacated (by the Judge) if it is found that the
          debt upon which the Order is based is invalid.

      (g) An entity who is owed a debt may cancel all or part of that
          debt at any time.

      (h) A Judge may enjoin the assessment of late penalties,
          restrict the amount of late penalties, or require the
          reduction or cancellation of a debt, by Judicial Order, when
          the Rules specifically so allow.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1479 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever a Rule calls for an Officer to pay out some
          quantity of Currency to some entity, that Officer shall
          execute a Notice of Debt for the given amount with that
          entity as payee and the Bank as payor.

      (b) Whenever a Rule calls for an Officer to bill an entity for
          some quantity of Currency, that Officer shall execute a
          Notice of Debt for the given amount with that entity as
          payor and the Bank as payee.

      (c) A Notice of Debt is executed by announcing in the Public
          Forum that the payor is indebted to the payee for the amount
          indicated, so long as the announcement sets for the reason
          therefore.

      (d) The lawful execution of a Notice of Debt causes the payor
          noted therein to be indebted to the payee noted therein for
          the amount noted therein, but only if the executor of the
          Notice of Debt was authorized to execute it, and the reason
          set forth therein is correct.

      (e) The duties required of Officers by this Rule shall be
          performed as soon as possible after they arise.

      (f) For the purposes of this Rule, the Speaker shall be
          considered an Officer.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1817 be amended to read:

      (a) The Recordkeepor of a Currency is required to record every
          transfer for which e receives a transfer notice denominated
          in the Currency of which e is the recordkeepor, when:
        (1) the notice was sent by the transferring entity's Executor,
            or, for an entity which lacks an Executor, by any other
            person empowered by the Rules to execute transfers on the
            behalf of the transferring entity;
        (2) the notice clearly sets forth the quantity to be
            transferred in a form such that the Recordkeepor can
            easily and definitively determine the amount being
            transferred;
        (3) the entity to receive the transfer is specified with
            sufficient clarity that a reasonable person in the
            Recordkeepor's position would know to which entity the
            transferring entity refers; and
        (4) the transfer is for an amount not more than the current
            holdings of the transferring entity.

      (b) Transfers shall be noted on the Recordkeepor's records in
          the order in which they are received by the Recordkeepor.

      (c) When a Recordkeepor records a transfer, e shall promptly
          inform the recipient of the transfer that the transfer has
          been recorded, unless it appears to the Recordkeepor that
          the recipient is already aware of the transfer.

      (d) When a Recordkeepor elects not to record a transfer for the
          reason that the transfer is not in conformance with any part
          of subdivision (a) of this Rule, e shall promptly inform
          both the transferrer and the recipient that the transfer has
          not be recorded, and give the reason therefor.  (If the
          reason for failure to record is that the recipient was not
          clearly specified, there is no duty to inform the
          recipient.)

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1696 be amended to read:

      (a) Voting Tokens are hereby designated as a Currency.  The sole
          designated Mintor of Voting Tokens is the Bank.  The
          Recordkeepor of Voting Tokens is irrevocably designated to
          be the Accountor.  The smallest indivisible unit for this
          Currency is 0.01 Voting Token.

      (b) The Accountor constructively agrees to act as Recordkeepor
          for Voting Tokens by accepting the Office.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1701 be amended to read:

      (a) Proposal Notes are hereby designated as a Currency.  The
          sole designated Mintor of Proposal Notes is the Bank.  The
          Recordkeepor of Proposal Notes is irrevocably designated to
          be the Promotor.

      (b) The Promotor constructively agrees to act as Recordkeepor
          for Proposal Notes by accepting the Office.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1435 be amended to read:

      (a) Indulgences are hereby designated as a Currency.  The sole
          designated Mintor of Indulgences is the Bank.  The
          Recordkeepor of Indulgences is irrevocably designated to be
          the Herald.

      (b) The Herald constructively agrees to act as Recordkeepor for
          Indulgences by accepting the Office.

      (c) An entity which owes a debt (or debts) to the Bank for any
          number of Indulgences is said to have that number of Blots.
          A Player has Blots equal to the sum of all such debts. Debts
          which are in dispute are still considered when determining
          how many Blots a Player has.

      (d) When a Rule states that a Player is to gain some number of
          Blots, a Notice of Debt shall be executed for the same
          number of Indulgences, naming that Player as the payor and
          the Bank as payee; this order shall be executed by whomever
          the Rules require to report the change in Blots.

      (e) A Player who has no debt in Indulgences to the Bank is
          Immaculate.

      (f) It is a Win-Preventing condition for a Player to have one or
          more Blots.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1601 be amended to read:

      (a) An entity is dissolute if it:
        (1) possesses any number of units of Currency, and
        (2) does not have an Executor.

      (b) The Notary may perform any of the following with respect to
          a dissolute entity:
        (1) transfer Currencies owned by that entity to any entity to
            which the dissolute entity owes debts, for the purpose of
            making partial or complete payment on those debts;
        (2) cancel any debts owed to it; or
        (3) Without Objection, transfer Currencies owned by that
            entity to the Bank.

      (c) The Notary is authorized, all other Rules notwithstanding,
          to transfer Currency from any dissolute entity to any other
          entity as if e were the dissolute entity's Executor, when e
          is permitted to do so in accordance with subdivision (b) of
          this Rule.

      (d) A dissolute entity is considered to continue to have legal
          existence as long as it continues to possess units of
          Currency, even if it is dissolved, destroyed, or otherwise
          would cease to have legal existence prior to that time.  An
          entity which has legal existence solely as a result of this
          subdivision is called "terminal".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1853 be amended to read:

      (a) Taxes may be levied only when the Rules explicitly permit
          it, and then only by the Officer authorized by the Rule
          permitting the levy.

      (b) An Officer levies a tax by announcing it in a Public Forum.
          An announcement of levy must specify:
        (1) The Currency being taxed;
        (2) the amount of the levy, expressed as a percentage; and
        (3) the legal authorization for the levy.

      (c) Upon the announcement of a tax levy conforming with
          subdivision (b) of this Rule, each entity other than the
          Bank becomes liable to the Bank for a debt equal to the
          stated percentage of that entity's holdings of the Currency
          stated in the announcement.  The amount of each entity's tax
          debt shall be based on the amount of that Currency owned by
          that entity at the time the announcement was made.

      (d) The Recordkeepor of the Currency named in a tax levy shall,
          as soon as possible after the announcement, provide a report
          setting out the amount of the taxed Currency held by every
          entity which held any units of that Currency at the time the
          announcement was made.  The Recordkeepor is not required to
          compute the tax due; if e does so, eir computations do not
          have any legal force.

      (e) The amount of tax levied may not exceed 50% of an entity's
          holdings unless the Rule which authorizes the tax explicitly
          permits it.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) The Voting Bank shall exist.

      (b) The Assessor is the Executor of the Voting Bank.

      (c) The Assessor shall not (as its Executor) transfer Currencies
          out of the Voting Bank except when required to do so by the
          Rules.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1442 be amended to read:

      (a) Proposals have a voting cost, equal to the Voting Tariff at
          the time they were distributed. If there was no value set
          for the Voting Tariff at that time, then the voting cost is
          1 VT.

      (b) Each Voting Entity who votes on a Proposal is liable to a
          debt to the Voting Bank for a number of Voting Tokens equal
          to the votes cast by that entity on that proposal,
          multiplied by the voting cost of that Proposal.  This debt
          is realized when the results of the Voting on that Proposal
          are announced.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1824 be amended to read:

      (a) Any entity who, at the beginning of a given Nomic Week, is
          overdue on a debt due to the Voting Bank, commits the
          Infraction of Debt Voting.

      (b) The penalty for Debt Voting shall be a denial of Voting
          Privileges for a period of two weeks.

      (c) Debt Voting shall be reported by the Assessor.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1470 be amended to read:

      (a) The Bank shall exist.

      (b) The Chancellor shall be the Executor of the Bank.

      (c) The Chancellor shall not transfer Currencies from the Bank
          except for the purpose of making payment upon the debts of
          the Bank, or when otherwise explictly required by the Rules
          to do so.

      (d) If the Chancellor makes a transfer not permitted by
          subdivision (c) of this Rule, e commits the Class A Crime of
          Misappropriation, and upon conviction of this Crime shall be
          removed from Office.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 766 be amended by deleting the
paragraph which reads "Each Group has Mint Authority."

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1466 be amended by replacing the
term "Payment Order" with the term "Notice of Debt" wherever it may
appear.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1742 be amended by deleting the
sentence which reads "When restitution would involve the transfer of
Currencies, the Judge is authorized to execute whatever Payment Orders
are necessary to effect fair and appropriate restitution." and also by
replacing the phrase "nor shall restitution include the execution of
Payment Orders, the payor of which is any entity not party to the
agreement" with "nor shall restitution include the requirement for any
entity not party to the agreement to make any transfer of Currency".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 502 be amended to read:

      (a) The Clerk of the Courts shall, within one week of the time a
          Player earns a Judicial Salary, pay out that Judicial Salary
          to that Player.

      (b) If a decision (or dismissal) which resulted in a Player
          earning a Judicial Salary is subsequently appealed and
          overturned on appeal, the Clerk of the Court shall bill that
          Judge for the refund of the Judicial Salary paid to em.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1664 be amended by replacing the
sentence "The Registrar shall vacate all Blots of each Rebellious
Player." with "All debts in Indulgences owed to the Bank by any
Rebellious Player are cancelled."; by deleting the paragraph which
begins "The Registrar shall execute all Payment Orders"; and by
deleting the paragraph which begins "The Registrar is authorised to
vacate".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1712 be amended by replacing "issue
a Payment order from the Bank to that Player for one Indulgence" with
"pay out one Indulgence to that Player".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1714 be amended by replacing the
paragraph beginning "An Overdue Payment Order" with the following:

      A Lawless Player is any Player who has overdue debts to the Bank
      totalling more than 30 Indulgences.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1727 be amended by replacing the
paragraphs which read:

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that, not less than seven days prior to
      Agora's Birthday, the Chancellor shall, on behalf of the Bank,
      submit delayed Transfer Orders to be executed at 00:04:30 GMT
      +1200 on Agora's Birthday to each Player for the amount of 3 VTs
      each;

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Chancellor shall, on behalf of
      the Bank, submit Transfer Orders for one P-note each from the
      Bank to each Player who posts to the Public Forum during Agora's
      Birthday a message recognizing Agora's Birthday; these Transfer
      Orders to be executed as soon as possible after Agora's Birthday
      ends;

with paragraphs reading:

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that, as close to 00:04:30 GMT +1200 on
      Agora's Birthday as practical, the Bank shall transfer to each
      Player the amount of 3 VTs;

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Bank shall transfer one P-note
      from the Bank to each Player who posts to the Public Forum
      during Agora's Birthday a message recognizing Agora's Birthday;
      these transfers to be executed as soon as possible after Agora's
      Birthday ends;

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1799 be amended to read:

      Any Order may always be amended, stayed, or vacated by the
      Player (or, in the case of Appellate Orders, Board of Appeal)
      who executed it.  Certain classes of Orders may be amended,
      stayed, or vacated in other circumstances as well, when the
      Rules so allow.  In all cases, this is done by an Order to
      Amend, Stay, or Vacate, respectively, the original Order.

      Otherwise, an Order shall not be amended, stayed, vacated, or
      otherwise changed once executed.

Be it further resolved, that Rules 1599, 1722, 1730, 1732, 1734, 1576,
1577, 1578, 1579, 1819, 1820, 1821, 1822, 1823, 1759, 1818, 1713,
1735, 1738, 1601, 1739, 1757 and 1637 be repealed.

I hereby submit the following Proposal, and pay 1 P-Note to raise its
Priority to one.

Blob

---

Proposal: 
Let everyone have a turn

Create a rule, with title "Turns for all", with text:

     Whenever a Player is selected to judge a CFJ, e becomes ineligible
     to judge any future CFJs. If ever there are no Players eligible to
     Judge a CFJ, then all Players made ineligible by this rule become
     eligible again.

     Being made ineligible to judge a CFJ by this rule does not cause
     a Player to become ineligible to serve as a Justice on that CFJ.
     This rule takes precedence over any rule which claims otherwise.


Amend Rule 698 ("Always an Eligible Judge"), by replacing the text:

      If there would otherwise be no Players eligible to Judge a CFJ,
      then all Active Players, excluding the Caller and those Players
      Barred by the Caller, shall be eligible, any other Rule to the
      contrary notwithstanding.

with:

      If, after taking all other rules affecting eligibility into
      account, there are no Players eligible to Judge a CFJ, then
      all Active Players, excluding the Caller and those Players
      Barred by the Caller, shall be eligible, any other Rule to 
      the contrary notwithstanding.

[Comments: 

v1.0: Complementary to the recent R-O-M proposal, although not
      necessarily relying on it. We've had the same judge selection 
      mechanism for ages, and while it works well enough, it might be 
      interesting to try something new.

v1.1: Added the second paragraph, at Michael's recommendation

v1.2: Amended R698 to explicitly apply only after all other rules have
      had there say.
