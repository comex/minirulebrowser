I hereby submit the following (disinterested) proposal:

Proposal: Perpetual Offices

Create a new rule, entitled "Holding an Office in Perpetuity", with the
text:

   If a certain Office is held in the normal fashion by a Player,
   then the Registrar may declare Without Objection that the Office
   is held in perpetuity, until such time as the Player holding the
   Office changes. 

   The Term of Service of an Office held in perpetuity shall never
   expire.  

   This Rule takes precedence over other rules defining the expiry
   of an Office's Term of Service.

I vote against both INP 353 and 354.

I'm not sure about INP355 (PlayNomic) yet - what do others think about
this?

INP 353 Present.  I haven't been following this
                  closely enough.

INP 354 Against.  Should not have left out
                  Bluesmobile, too bad.

INP 355 Present.  Might be interesting, but
                  I certainly won't have time
                  for it.  8(

I vote as follows on the various current INP referenda:

>2.1. INP 353

Against.  If New Rishonnomic is a voting member of IN, it is a travesty
to remove it without serious cause for doing so.

>2.2. INP 354

Against, on the grounds that it may remove Bluesmobile Nomic as
a voting member.

>2.3. INP 355

Against.  Although I am not opposed to subgames of IN per se, I
do not think they should have the same rights as member nomics
in IN, voting or non-voting.  If this does pass, I would encourage
all organizations of Agora to register themselves with IN, to
demonstrate the absurdity of such a thing.
