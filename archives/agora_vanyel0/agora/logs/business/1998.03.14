Re: DIS: Delegation

Well, I already gave it back, but if you want to re-delegate, I consent to the
delegation for Promotor, again.

On second thoughts, I think I may have been a bit premature in that
announcement. It's probably better that I don't take back the Promotor-
ship just yet. My wrists are still not quite in as good a state as they
might be.

I didn't get any such message - where did you send it?

Anyhow, I hereby delegate the Office of Promotor to Crito, again.

This Week with ROM

Using the current Ruleset, which at this point includes the passage of the Veto
Scam, I count 308 Rules.  The following numbers were randomly generated:

152 = Rule 1564 Initiating Appeals
 46 = Rule 1556 Terms of Service for Offices
 28 = Rule 1677 Currency Awards for New Players
 53 = Rule 1665 Abuse of Responsibility
222 = Rule 1785 The Accountor

I don't like any of the choices this week, but I have to choose something, so
it will be Rule 1665.

So, acting as Exector and on behalf of the Repeal-O-Matic, I hereby submit the
following Proposal:

           PROPOSAL: Repeal Rule 1665 (Abuse of Responsibility)
                     This Proposal shall have an AI = 1
                     Rule 1665 is hereby Repealed.
