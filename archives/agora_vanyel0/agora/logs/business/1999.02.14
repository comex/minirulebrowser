I wonder if people would be happy to give more power to the senate?  The 
original idea was to give the Senate more power and so create 
stablility.  However, it looks like there might be a big punch up 
though.  Which would be fun, I think.

There are a couple of little changes, and organisational points.  The 
two main points added are that ANY Senator may make a proposal into a 
Senate proposal, and Senators can be removed from the Senate.  This 
could give the Senate a huge amount of power, but as long as there at 
least two "nice" Senators it should be fine.  Hopefully this might be a 
more useful idea than my last couple.  (I think they are getting better 
though).


Protoposal.         Power to the Senate.

Amend rule 1717 to read

The Senate

There exist Nomic entities know as Senators, there also exists a Nomic 
entity known as the Senate.  The Senate is the collective of all the 
Senators.  Only Senators are members of the Senate.

A Player may only become a Senator as defined by the rules.  A player 
may only cease to be a Senator as defined by the rules.  Any Senator 
that is not a player ceases to be a Senator.  If a Senator is removed 
from the Senate, e ceases to be a Senator.  

A Player who has been registered continuously for the immediately 
preceding two months becomes a Senator, if and only if e has not been a 
Senator at any point during those two months.

There are always at least three Senators.  If at any point there is less 
than three Senators, the registered player, who is not a Senator, and 
who has not been a Senator for the longest period of time amongst the 
registered players, becomes a Senator.




Create a new rule with the following text.

Senator Powers

A Senator may decide to suggest that a registered player becomes a 
Senator, by stating so in a public forum.  The player becomes a Senator 
one week after the suggestion, unless a Senator objects to the 
suggestion within the week.

A Senator may decide to suggest that a Senator is removed from the 
Senate, by stating so in a public forum.  The Senator is removed from 
the Senate one week after the suggestion, unless a Senator, excluding 
the Senator in question, objects to the suggestion within the week.

Any Senator may choose to remove themselves from the Senate.



Create a rule with the following text:

Senate Proposals

At any time during a Proposal's Voting Period, a Senator may make it a 
Senate Proposal, by stating so in the Public Forum.  If that does not 
happen, the Proposal is not a Senate Proposal.  

A Senator may object to the proposal becoming a Senate Proposal by 
stating so in the public forum during the Proposal’s Voting Period, in 
which case the proposal ceases to be a Senate Proposal, and returns to 
its previous state.

If a Senator objects to a proposal Senate Proposal, that Proposal may 
not become a Senate proposal again.

Entities other than Senators cannot Vote on Senate Proposals. If an 
Entity other than a Senator has already voted on a Proposal by the time 
it becomes a Senate Proposal, eir votes on that Proposal are cancelled, 
these votes remain canceled even if the Proposal reverts from being a 
Senate Proposal.



I think I might actually propose this. (as if it manages to get passed I 
get a pile of VTs)  So ideas and suggestions would be very welcome.

That's a real shame. I feel guilty because I have really been enjoying
the way the game has been going recently - a lot more interesting 
competition and politicking. But I don't want to do so at other players' 
expense.

In memory of Andre, I hereby set the Voting Tariff for next week to 0 VTs.

And I make the following proto:

Proto: A Momument to Democracy

Create a rule, entitled "Back to Basics", with text:

      The month of February shall be a celebration of Democracy in Agora.
      The Voting Tariff and Priority Bar both shall be set to zero for 
      all Proposals distributed during this month.

Well, I'm a little sad to see this experiment end so early, but this has
_not_ passed: the Voting Index must be _greater_ than the AI for the
Proposal to pass.

This is a COE.
