I Judge TRUE.  I have nothing to add to the Caller's Arguments, except
to note that higher Powered Rules are generally able to defer to lower
Powered Rules by avoiding conflict (e.g. by saying "unless another Rule
says otherwise").

I grant the Motion to Annotate, and Order the Rulekeepor to Annotate
Rule 1482 with a copy of the Statement of this CFJ.

Ok.  I think this clearly needs a closer look.  I agree that trying to draw a
distinction between a Rule saying "this rule defers to another rule" and
"unless another rule says something different" is silly.  I hereby call for the
appeal of CFJ1103.

>(Caller's) Arguments:

>      on Proposals, Elections or Referenda, may only be achieved by

>======================================================================
 
I Judge this statement to be TRUE.  As the caller points out, the wording in
R1859 is clear and unambiguous regarding the manner in which a vote may be
cast, and the first clause is clearly a claim of precedence (without, I should
note, using the explicit phrase "This rule takes precedence over...").
