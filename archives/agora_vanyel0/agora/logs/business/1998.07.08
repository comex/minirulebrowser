Various ideas that popped into my head this evening;

Proto: Vote Early, Vote Often

Create a rule, entitled "The Early Bird...", with text:

     At the end of the voting period of a Proposal, the Assesor
     shall pay out 1 VT to the first Player (other than the Assessor)
     to have voted on that Proposal, who did not subsequently change
     or retract eir vote.

[Comments: An incentive to vote - with a sting in the tail. As long
 as voting is secret, you can't be sure whether you really are 
 going to be the first one to vote.]

Proto: Skimming a bit off the top.

Amend rule 1449 ("The Assessor") to read:

      There shall exist the Office of Assessor.  The Assessor
      shall receive a weekly salary equal to 0.5 times the Basic
      Officer Salary.

      The Assessor shall also receive a Commission. At the end
      of the Voting Period for a Proposal, the Assessor shall
      pay out to emself an amount equal to 5% of the VTs spent
      on voting on that Proposal.

[Comment: Gives the Assessor good reason to encourage voting,
 although maybe it leaves em a bit too much at the mercy of the 
 Promotor, who controls the batch sizes. Things are better, if it
 is combined with the below.]

Proto: What does this lever do?

Crete a rule, entitled "The Voting Tariff", with text:

      The Voting Tariff is a number of VTs, a multiple of the
      MUQ, between 0.5 and 2.0 inclusive. Unless the Rules give
      it another value, the Voting Tariff is 1 VT.

      The Assessor may change the value of the Voting Tariff by
      announcing the new value in the Public Forum, provided that
      e announces a value within the range proscribed above, that
      e makes the announcement prior to midnight GMT Thursday, and 
      that e has not already made such an announcement earlier in 
      the Week. The new value of the Voting Tariff does not take
      effect until the beginning of the Nomic Week after the
      change has been announced.

Amend rule Rule 1442 ("The Cost of Voting") to read:

      Proposals have a voting cost, equal to the Voting Tariff
      at the time they were distributed. If there was no value
      set for the Voting Tariff at that time, then the voting
      cost is 1 VT.

      As soon as possible after the end of the Voting Period of a
      given Proposal, the Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity a
      number of Voting Tokens equal to the votes cast on that
      Proposal by that entity multiplied by the voting cost for
      that Proposal.

[Comment: Yet another parameter for the economy. Gives us a way 
 to handle voting slumps, like the present one, by making voting
 cheaper. If tied to the Assessor's income, as proto'ed above, it
 gives the Assessor an interesting dilemma - does e raise prices to
 increase eir commission, or would e be better off lowering them
 and attracting more voters?]
