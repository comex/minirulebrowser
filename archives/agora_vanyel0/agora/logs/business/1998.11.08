This message contains one or more Proposals.  Each Proposal begins
immediately after a line marked "**START PROPOSAL" and ends
immediately before the first following line marked "**END PROPOSAL".

The following Proposal is to be titled "Proposals may Order" and is to
have Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1794 be amended to read:

      (a) Each Order is of one of the following classes:
        (1) Judicial: A Judicial Order is an Order executed by a
            Player while acting as a Judge.
        (2) Appellate: An Appellate Order is an Order executed by a
            Board of Appeals. 
        (3) Administrative: An Administrative Order is an Order
            executed by an Officer in the course of performing the
            duties of that Office, except when those duties involve
            acting as a member of a Board of Appeals.
        (4) Legislative: A Legislative Order is an Order executed as
            part of the effect of the adoption of a Proposal.
        (5) Private: A Private Order is any Order not described above.

      (b) For the purpose of this Rule, the holder of any of the
          following positions shall be considered an Officer when
          performing a duty required by or a privilege permitted only
          by virtue of holding that position:
        (1) the Speaker;
        (2) the Recordkeepor of a Currency; or
        (3) the Trustee of an entity in Probate.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      (a) A Proposal may contain one or more Orders.  

      (b) The effect of adopting a Proposal which contains Orders is
          to execute those Orders.  Such Orders are known as
          Legislative Orders, are deemed to have been executed by that
          Proposal, and are deemed to have been executed as of the
          date of the proclamation of the Proposal's adoption.

      (c) Legislative Orders may not be stayed, vacated, or amended
          except:
        (1) by a subsequent Legislative Order;
        (2) by a Judicial Order issued only after a judicial finding
            that the Proposal containing the Legislative Order was not
            adopted, was barred from taking effect, or was invalid; or
        (3) by the Clerk of the Courts, but only for the purpose of
            staying such an Order during the pendency of a dispute
            which might reasonably lead to a judicial finding of the
            sort mentioned in subdivision (c)(2) of this Rule.

**END PROPOSAL

Due to recent workload, my life has been having some downtime lately. 
Nontheless, I'm now back to read a thousand nomic messages.

>I hereby cause Proglet to become Quiet. 
>Proglet? Are you there? Say something to us in the PF...

ok, I'm here now.

>BUS: Proglet Abandons the Game

whoops, looks like I was a little too quiet for a little too long...

As it is now November, and that was October, I believe that I am 
now eligible to reregister by requesting so to a public forum.

I hereby request reregistration.

(In the meantime, I'll keep on punching through that email!)

thanks,
proglet
