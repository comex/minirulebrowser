Proposal Chuck112
CounterScam the Veto Scam, Part I

I request that this Proposal have AI=1.
This Proposal is Sane.

A Rule shall be created with the following text:

      Upon creation of this Rule, the Voting Index of the Proposal
      entitled "CounterScam the Veto Scam, Part II" shall be set to 6.
      Immediately following that, the Proposal entitled "CounterScam
      the Veto Scam, Part II" shall take effect; that is, the
      provisions contained in the text of that Proposal shall be
      implemented to the maximal extent permitted by the Rules.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would prevent
      "CounterScam the Veto Scam, Part II" from having effect at
      the time required by this Rule, or from having effect at all.

      All references to "CounterScam the Veto Scam, Part II" in
      this Rule shall be taken to refer to the Proposal of that
      Title which was Proposed by the same Player as the Proposal
      which created this Rule.  If there is more than one such
      Proposal, then the first and second paragraphs of this
      Rule are without effect.

      This Rule shall repeal itself at 12:00 GMT on 15 April 1998.

[Comment: Although this has a certain similarity to the recent
situation regarding impeachments, it was conceived of before
the impeachment situation was brought to light.

Part II will be proposed once Part I has been distributed.]

------------------------------------------------------------

I transfer 2 P-Notes to the Bank in order to make this Proposal Sane.
I transfer 3 P-Notes to the Bank in order to raise the Priority of
this Proposal to 3.
