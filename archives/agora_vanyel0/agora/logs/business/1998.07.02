Actually, I think it would be better to make that the definition of
'in circulation'. 

H. Promotor Crito,

I hereby submit the following Proposal, paying 1 P-Note to the Bank
to raise its Priority to 1.

####
Proposal
Tweak the Taxation Rules

[Comment: two minor fixes to the taxation Rules. The first changes the
definition of 'in circulation' to exclude Currency already owed to the
Bank (this fixes the bug which would otherwise require the Accountor to
Levy Taxes, after e has just done so, but before any taxes have been paid).
The second lifts the requirement that the taxation POs actually be made
in the same message as the taxation announcement, and removes the silly
requirement that the Accountor tax the Bank. As a bonus, I include the
repeal of R1838 (Tabula Rasa), which should have been provided with an
auto-repeal mechanism, but wasn't due to an oversight on my part.]

Be it hereby resolved that R1852 (Circulation of Voting Tokens) be
amended by replacing in it the text which currently reads:

      An amount of Currency is in circulation if it exists and is not
      possessed by the Bank. 

with text which reads:

      The amount of a Currency in circulation is the amount of that
      Currency possessed by entities other than the Bank, minus the 
      total of the undisputed Payment Orders for that Currency naming
      entities other than Bank as payor, and the Bank as payee.

Be it further resolved that R1853 (Levying Taxes) be amended by replacing
in it the text which currently reads:

      Finally, the announcement must contain Payment Orders naming
      each entity in possession of the named Currency as payor, and
      with the Bank as payee, for an amount of the named Currency
      equal to the amount of the levy.

with text which reads:

      As soon as possible after making the announcement, the
      Accountor is required to execute Payment Orders naming each
      entity other than the Bank in possession of the named Currency
      as payor, and with the Bank as payee, for an amount of the
      named Currency equal to the amount of the levy. 

Be it further resolved that R1838 (Tabula Rasa) be repealed.

I've actually lost the message in which the Parcel was passed to Kolja.
Does anyone still have it? In any case, here is the contents of the
encrypted parcel information message:

This Week with R-O-M

I count 353 Rules in the current Rule set.  The candidates this week are:

 11 = Rule  478 The Public Forum
133 = Rule 1793 Orders
323 = Rule 1531 Administrators and Their Duties
183 = Rule 1564 Initiating Appeals
263 = Rule 1855 Plots

Another lousy week.  I'll select Rule 1855, but I don't have time to make it
comprehensive.  Unless someone gets cute, this one will just die for lack of
priority.

Acting as Executor and on behalf of the Repeal-O-Matic I perform the following
actions:

I transfer one P-Note from the R-O-M to the Bank for the purpose of increasing
the priority of "Repeal Rule 1543 (The Wizard)" by one.

I submit the following proposal:

PROPOSAL: Repeal Rule 1855 (Plots)
This Proposal shall have an AI = 1

Rule 1855 is hereby Repealed.
