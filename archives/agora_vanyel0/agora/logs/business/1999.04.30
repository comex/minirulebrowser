COTC: please note there are 5 distinct CFJs in this message.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

I call for Judgement on the following statement, barring Steve:

In posting a message to agora-business with the subject "Maximize
your website's traffic!", Steve committed the Crime of
Misrepresentation by listing "janet9981@yahoo.com" as the "From:"
address.

Arguments:
Steve is not janet9981@yahoo.com, nor did he believe himself to
be at that address at the time the message was posted.  While a
mailing list's moderator might be justified in posting a message
which had been rejected from a list to that list, this is not
the case here, as 1) by Steve's own admission, the spam which
makes up most of this message was sent to Geoff Wong, and not
to a-b, and 2) the message was altered by Steve by the inclusion
of additional text.  Thus, the message can only be construed as
being from Steve, and by listing an address which was not Steve's
in the "From:" line, he committed the Crime of Misrepresentation.

Evidence available upon request.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

I call for Judgement on the following statement, barring Steve:

In posting a message to agora-business with the subject "Maximize
your website's traffic!", Steve committed the Crime of
Misrepresentation by stating, on or around lines 12-13 of the
body of the message,

"If your website isn't located in the top-30 listings of these 
engines, chances are your site will never be seen."

Argument:
Steve is fully aware that being in the top-30 listings of
search engines is not the only way for a web site to be found.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

I call for Judgement on the following statement, barring Steve:

In posting a message to agora-business with the subject "Maximize
your website's traffic!", Steve committed the Crime of
Misrepresentation by stating, on or around lines 138-155 of the
body of the message,

"Here's a sampling of some results we've acheived for previous 
clients. (These examples are for competitive keywords--not just 
obscure words on which no one is conducting searches.)


<> 6 top-10 rankings on Infoseek for different relevant keywords

<> 18 top-10 rankings across the major search engines

<> 3 top-10 rankings on Alta Vista for one keyword

<> 16 total *number one* rankings

<> 40 top-30 rankings, spread across the different engines.

<> 1 to 2 hits per week increased to 500 per day

<> 45,000 hits per month grew to 108,000."

Argument:
Steve knows that neither he, nor any "we" which might reasonably
include Steve, has not achieved such results with web pages.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

I call for Judgement on the following statement, barring Steve:

In posting a message to agora-business with the subject "Maximize
your website's traffic!", Steve committed the Crime of
Misrepresentation by stating, on or around lines 188-189 of the
body of the message,

"<> Call us--we'll answer any questions you may have and provide
     a no-cost initial consultation.      (310) 859-4659 "

Argument:
Steve knows that neither he, nor any "we" which might reasonably
include Steve, has the phone number indicated.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

I call for Judgement on the following statement, barring Steve:

In posting a message to agora-business with the subject "Maximize
your website's traffic!", Steve committed the Crime of
Misrepresentation by stating, on or around lines 250-252 of the
body of the message,

"Search Engine Success Group  -  Call us at: 

                             (310) 859-4659    "

Argument:
Steve knows that neither he, nor any "us" which might reasonably
include Steve, has the phone number indicated.

You are right. Peekee should have received five points for 
getting a Proposal passed, none for you. I will post a
revised report shortly. And one point for you, for making
this COE!

As Peekee points out, P3854 has indeed passed by the narrowest of
margins. So I issue the follwing PO:

  Ass#  Payor          Payee      Amt  Currency 
------  -----          -----      ---  --------
avt162  Bank           Peekee      3   VTs      

Assessor Blob

PS: If anyone would care to repeal the Narrow Margins rule, or at least
amend it so that I only have to do it when someone points it out, then
I'd be much obliged. :)

This is an interesting idea, but I can't support it in its present form,
because it undoes some of the amendments to R206 that were adopted in A
Separation of Powers.

H. Assessor Blob,

I vote against P3561.

Well, time is running short, so it's time to call
the Court into session.  I hereby enter a judgement
of TRUE.

Reasoning:

Issue 1 - "clear indication"

First, I wish to express my thanks to all those who
participated in the recent (and enjoyable) debate,
for their assistance in helping me clarify my
thoughts on this subject.

Throughout the recent debate I had been focusing my
attention on the definition of "clear" wrt R1483, and
it seemed to me that it was a toss-up as to whether
"clear" must apply to the entire message or only to
the imbedded statement of intent to propose.  Ultimately,
however, I was persuaded that this judgement hinged more 
upon the meaning of "indication".

The message can be divided as follows:  A large amount of
"irrelevant" material; a statement of intent to propose;
the text of a potential proposal; a statement of intent
to adopt two proposals Without Objection.  But is that
extra material really irrelevant?  Since it was sent to
the PF, we must evaluate it for significance wrt to Agora.
And, indeed, it is significant for its intent to distract
Players from reading the other parts of the message.  So
it modifies all parts of the message, including the
statement of intent to propose.  IMO then, it becomes an 
integral part of the "indication" which it renders obtuse
and obscure.  As such it is not a "clear indication" as
required by R1483.

Issue 2 - Identity

One other thing I noticed when reviewing the post is that
nowhere in the message is any Player of Agora identified
as the sender of the message or as the author of the
portions relevant to Agora.  Even the archives still list
the unknown "janet"-whatever as the author.  We only have
Steve's word that it was e who sent it.  Now I don't doubt
Steve's honesty in this regard, but I tend to think that
this should not be sufficient to regard the message as legally
having been sent by em.  We have often required Players
in the past to present evidence (i.e. copies of messages
with headers) that they have actually done something they
claim to have done.  Currently in Agora, the messages and
their headers are the only "physical" evidence we have
available to us.  Consider the following scenarios:

1.  I give my office-mate some text describing actions
    significant to Agora and ask em to e-mail that text
    to agora-business, using eir own account.

2.  Blob comes by to visit me here in Boston, and while I
    step out for a couple of minutes to use the facilities,
    e sends a message to agora-business using my computer
    which I have carelessly left logged on.

Neither of the above leave any "physical" trace of who really
sent the message to a-b.  It either requires relying on
someone's word or establishing a consistent method of dealing
with the issue of a message's source.  I think the latter
serves the interest of the game better and so I will attempt
to use the Courts to establish such a principle here.

A message can be considered to have been sent by a given Player if
and only if the message clearly identifies that Player as the
author.  If the "sender" specified in the message header is one
officially published by the Registrar, then that establishes the
Player's identity definitively.

The "spam" post fails this test and, in the opinion of this court,
should be deemed not to have been sent by any Player, further
establishing a reason to find a judgement of TRUE, not to mention
having implications for the other actions attempted within
this message.

How did you calculate that? By my estimation, the total Priority of
these proposals was 1.2 (1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0) so 5% of that is 0.06.
Which, rounded down, gives a commission of zero.

If you want to receive a positive commission, you will probably have to
raise the priority bar.

I have decided I do like 3858, given that the Factor can be either 
greater or less than 1. I vote FOR it.

I think this is a serious mistake, for two reasons, either of which
alone would be sufficient to show that I legally sent the message:

1. I think there is evidence beyond reasonable doubt that I sent the
message in question. If necessary, I can call the friend who passed the
spam message on to me to give evidence regarding the plans I made to use
the spam message for the purposes of executing the scam. There are also
the headers of the message itself. The full headers should show that the
message passed through my account at <socrates@gecko>.

2. We have in the past accepted messages originating from other sources
than a Player's regular account as being from that Player, simply
accepting that Player's word that the messages were from him. I recall
that KoJen borrowed Michael's account for a period while he was in the
UK, and there have been numerous instances of messages posted from
unusual accounts when a Player has been unable to access eir regular
account for one reason or another.

I therefore call for the Appeal of this Judgement.

I also note that if Crito's Judgement is upheld, then I doubt that I can
be found guilty of Misrepresentation.
