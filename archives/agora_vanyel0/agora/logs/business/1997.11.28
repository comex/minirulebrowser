Proto:  Declaration of Absence (v2.0)

Amend Rule 1715 to read:

      A Player may declare that e is PRESENT or ABSENT on a Proposal,
      Election or Referendum, by sending a message to that effect to
      the Vote Collector of this Proposal, Election or Referendum.

      Players who declare themselves PRESENT on a Proposal, Election
      or Referendum during the Voting Period of that Proposal,
      Election or Referendum are, solely for the purpose of
      determining Quorum, considered to have voted, but a Player who
      both declares emself PRESENT and also Votes on the Proposal,
      Election or Referendum is counted only once toward Quorum.

      Players who declare themselves ABSENT on a Proposal, Election
      or Referendum are not considered to have voted, unless they
      also Vote or declare themselves PRESENT.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which determine
      Quorum or whether a Proposal, Election or Referendum has met
      Quorum.

[Clarified what a Declaration of Absence does.]

Amend Rule 452 by replacing the paragraph beginning "This Rule shall in
no way prohibit the Vote Collector" with this paragraph:

      This Rule shall in no way prohibit the Vote Collector from
      posting, at any time and to the Public Forum, a list of those
      Voting Entities which have already voted or declared Presence
      or Absence on a given Proposal, Election or Referendum.  If a
      Voting Entity has performed one of these actions in the Public
      Forum, then the Vote Collector is permitted to state that that
      Voting Entity has performed that action.  Otherwise, the Vote
      Collector is prohibited from specifying which of these actions
      a Voting Entity has performed.  The publication of a list as
      described in this Rule is not a Crime, unless specified as such
      by another Rule.

[Independent of Proposal 3610, but incorporating its idea and fixing
 its bug.]

Amend Rule 683 by replacing "FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN" with "FOR or
AGAINST".

Amend Rule 1717 by replacing this paragraph:

      Entities other than Senators cannot Vote on Senate Proposals.
      If any Entity other than a Senator has already Voted on a
      Proposal by the time it becomes a Senate Proposal, their Votes
      on that Proposal change to ABSTAIN, and cannot change
      thereafter, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, and at the
      end of the Voting Period, the cost of casting those Votes is
      transferred to them.

with this paragraph:

      Entities other than Senators cannot Vote on Senate Proposals.  If
      any Entity other than a Senator has already Voted on a Proposal
      by the time it becomes a Senate Proposal, then both their Votes on
      that Proposal and any delayed Transfer Orders generated by those
      Votes are cancelled.

[Is there an outstanding Proposal that, if adopted, would amend Rule 1717?]

Amend Rule 1434 by replacing "FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN" with "FOR or
AGAINST".

Amend Rule 1663 by replacing "FOR, AGAINST and ABSTAIN" with "FOR and
AGAINST".

Fair enough.  Let's try this:

ProtoProposal
Late Judgements

Amend Rule 408 to read:

      The Player assigned to Judge a Call for Judgement is required to
      either return a Judgement upon that CFJ or dismiss that CFJ
      within the assigned deliberation period, which ends seven days after
      e is assigned to Judge it.

      Failure to do so is the Infraction of Judging Late, detected
      and reported by the CotC. At the time of the report of infraction,
      if the CFJ has been Judged or dismissed then the penalty is 1 VT and
      the Judgement or dismissal is legal even though delivered late.
      Otherwise the penalty is 3 Blots, and the Judge becomes ineligible to
      Judge that CFJ, and a new Judge shall be assigned in the usual manner.

      A Judge who has neither judged nor dismissed a CFJ within seven days
      after the end of the assigned deliberation period becomes ineligible
      to Judge that CFJ, and any Judgement or Dismissal submitted after this
      time is not legal and shall not be accepted by the CotC.

      However, if the Player assigned to Judge a CFJ ceases to be
      eligible prior to the end of the permitted time, e is neither
      required nor permitted to either return a Judgement on, or
      dismiss, that CFJ, and ceases to be the Judge assigned to that
      CFJ at the moment e becomes ineligible.


Amend Rule 591 by deleting the sentence:

      A Judgement returned after the end of
      the permitted deliberation period, or by a Player ineligible to
      be Judge of that CFJ is not legal and shall not be accepted by
      the Clerk.

and changing the last sentence to read

      A Judge who delivers Judgement on a CFJ before the end of
      the assigned deliberation period shall receive a Judicial
      Salary of 1 VT.


Amend Rule 1565 by deleting the text ", and only when issued by the Judge
within the permitted deliberation period"

and changing the last sentence to read

      A Judge who dismisses a CFJ before the end of the assigned
      deliberation period shall receive a Judicial Salary of 1 VT.


Amend Rule 1447 by changing the last sentence to read

      Each Justice who submits eir determination to the CotC before
      the end of the assigned deliberation period shall receive a Judicial
      Salary of 1 VT each upon the publication of their determinations.




Rule 1447/10 (Power=1)
Final Judgement upon Appeal

      Once a Board of Appeals has been selected to decide a particular
      appeal, the Justices shall, collectively, consider the question.

      Each Justice has seven days, from the point e becomes Justice on
      a particular Board, in which to reach a determination that
      either sustains or overturns the matter being considered by that
      Board and submit it to the CotC.

      Failure to do so is the Infraction of Failing to Judge an
      Appeal, detected and reported by the CotC, bearing a penalty of
      3 Blots, which results in that Justice's dismissal as a Justice
      from that Board. In this case the CotC must randomly select an
      eligible Player to replace em.

      After all three Justices have submitted their determinations to
      the CotC, the CotC shall post these determinations in the Public
      Forum along with any arguments, evidence, or other material
      included with those determinations.

      If a majority of the Justices agree to sustain the matter being
      considered, it is sustained; otherwise, it is overturned.  The
      specific results of overturning a matter upon appeal are
      determined by the Rules permitting such appeals.

      All three Justices receive a Judicial Salary of 1 VT each
      upon the publication of their determinations.





Rule 408/7 (Power=1)
Accepting Judge-ship

      The Player assigned to Judge a Call for Judgement is required to
      either return a Judgement upon that CFJ or dismiss that CFJ
      within seven days of when e was assigned to Judge it.  If e
      fails to do so, e ceases to be eligible to Judge that CFJ,
      ceases to be assigned to Judge that CFJ, and commits the
      Infraction of Failing to Judge to be reported by the Clerk of
      the Courts and bearing a penalty of three Blots.

      However, if the Player assigned to Judge a CFJ ceases to be
      eligible prior to the end of the permitted time, e is neither
      required nor permitted to either return a Judgement on, or
      dismiss, that CFJ, and ceases to be the Judge assigned to that
      CFJ at the moment e becomes ineligible.


Rule 591/10 (Power=1)
Legal Judgements

      A Judge returns a Judgement by sending it to the Clerk of the
      Courts.  A Judgement must be either TRUE or FALSE, and must be
      delivered to the Clerk not later than the end of the permitted
      time for deliberation.  A Judgement returned after the end of
      the permitted deliberation period, or by a Player ineligible to
      be Judge of that CFJ is not legal and shall not be accepted by
      the Clerk.

      A CFJ has been Judged when a legal Judgement has been received
      by the Clerk.

      As soon as possible after the receipt of a legal Judgement, the
      Clerk shall distribute the Judgement to the Public Forum.

      A Judge who delivers Judgement on a CFJ shall receive a Judicial
      Salary of 1 VT.


Rule 1565/5 (Power=1)
Dismissal of a CFJ

      A Judge must dismiss a CFJ if one of the following is true of
      it:

        i) It contains no clearly-identifiable Statement.
       ii) Its Statement can not logically admit to either being TRUE
           or FALSE.
      iii) Its Statement does not relate to a matter relevant to the
           Rules.
       iv) Its Statement fails to comply with the Rules.
        v) It lacks standing, as defined elsewhere.
       vi) After a reasonable effort by the Judge to obtain all
           relevant information, no determination can be made of the
           truth or falsity of its Statement.

      The Judge does this by notifying the CotC of the CFJ's
      dismissal, and the reasons e is doing so.  Dismissals are only
      legal when made for the reasons listed in this Rule, and only
      when issued by the Judge within the permitted deliberation
      period.  Dismissal occurs when the CotC is notified of a legal
      dismissal.

      As soon as possible after being notified of a legal dismissal,
      the CotC must post to the Public Forum a notice of the dismissal
      and the Judge's reasons for doing so.

      If the dismissal, upon appeal, is subsequently set aside, then
      that CFJ is no longer dismissed. It shall be considered again
      and can not again be legally dismissed for the same reasons.

      A Judge who dismisses a CFJ shall receive a Judicial Salary of 1
      VT.




Rule 1447/10 (Power=1)
Final Judgement upon Appeal

      Once a Board of Appeals has been selected to decide a particular
      appeal, the Justices shall, collectively, consider the question.

      Each Justice has seven days, from the point e becomes Justice on
      a particular Board, in which to reach a determination that
      either sustains or overturns the matter being considered by that
      Board and submit it to the CotC.

      Failure to do so is the Infraction of Failing to Judge an
      Appeal, detected and reported by the CotC, bearing a penalty of
      3 Blots, which results in that Justice's dismissal as a Justice
      from that Board. In this case the CotC must randomly select an
      eligible Player to replace em.

      After all three Justices have submitted their determinations to
      the CotC, the CotC shall post these determinations in the Public
      Forum along with any arguments, evidence, or other material
      included with those determinations.

      If a majority of the Justices agree to sustain the matter being
      considered, it is sustained; otherwise, it is overturned.  The
      specific results of overturning a matter upon appeal are
      determined by the Rules permitting such appeals.

      All three Justices receive a Judicial Salary of 1 VT each
      upon the publication of their determinations.


{Comments:
1.) Late judgements are legal, provided they reach the CotC before e
reports the Judge for failure to judge.

2.) Mild penalty for judging late.  I expect that any CFJ later than a day
or so will be reported and reassigned first, and there shouldn't be  Blots
for a matter of a couple of hours.

3.) The CotC has discretion on when to guillotine the lateness period, but
at most one week.}

Unfortunately, the first proposal in my queue legally needs to be distributed
before Monday (actually I normally would have distributed it last week, but I
didn't actually read it until late on Monday and failed to notice the early
date on the header), so I will go ahead and distribute it now, since it won't
matter.  The rest in my queue, and any others I receive before then, I will
distribute on Tuesday.

OFF:  New Proposals: 3623

There is one new proposal distributed as of this report.

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 879 be amended, by replacing the
text "35% of all Players, or 50% of all the Players not On Hold" with
"one-third of Active Players, or one-fifth of all Players".

Harlequin requests:

>CFJs, if I am still on that list. Thank you.

General Chaos responded:

This is true, but Rule 1567 allows a Player to make emself ineligible for a
CFJ.  The Clerk received the following note at 10 Nov 1997 22:02:46 -0500:

[...]
>I hereby make myself ineligible to be assigned any CFJs.
[...]
>-- Harlequin the Very Very Busy

Previous Clerks have taken such an announcement as a standing request under
Rule 1567 to be made ineligible for each CFJ as it comes up for judgment,
and I interpret it similarly.

I take Harlequin's new request as discontinuing his earlier request. It is
so noted.  Barring further changes to eligibility, Harlequin will be
eligible for CFJ 1073 (should it be called).
