H. Distributor, H. Registrar,

Kindly change my preferred email address to 'laurent@netdive.com'. I
will henceforth be using this as my From: header and it seems that
the last couple messages I sent to the Agora lists, with this
address, didn't make it back - bounced, I assume.

Is it technically possible to have the mailing lists recognize both 
my email addresses (morendil@micronet.fr and laurent@netdive.com) as 
valid for sending mail to the list, without my being subscribed twice 
to the list and thus getting two copies of all mail ? If so, rather 
than record a change in my address I would prefer to have the second 
address added in that manner...

Thx,
