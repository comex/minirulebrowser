In preparation for terminating Zefram's Probate, would the relevant
Recordkeepors please inform me how many Voting Tokens, P-Notes, and
Indulgences Zefram currently possesses?

It is my belief that Zefram has no debts, credits, or Will, so that
terminating Probate will consist merely of transferring all eir
Currency to the Bank.

H. CotC elJefe!

I hereby submit the following CFJ, barring Chuck.

Statement:

      The Rule entitled 'A Public Voting Experiment' has not yet been
      given a Rule Number by the Rulekeepor.

Argument:

Proposal 3555, which enacted 'A Public Voting Experiment', passed on
Oct. 24, 1997. Rulekeepor Chuck subsequently assigned it, or at least
attempted to assign it, the number 1741. This attempt, however, could
not have been successful. The number 1741 was not, as it is required
to be by R1349, the "least integer greater than all other Numbers
previously given to a Rule", for that number had previously been
assigned to the Rule 'Restore Game balance II', enacted by Proposal
3538. It is true that at the time Chuck assigned the number 1741 to
'A Public Voting Experiment', he did not then believe that P3538 had
passed. However, there had been an earlier time during which he had
believed that P3538 had passed, and during that time, he did assign
the Number 1741 to 'Restore Game Balance II'. Although he later came
to believe that P3538 failed and that therefore his assignment of
the Number 1741 to 'Restore game Balance II' had been incorrect,
subsequent events have shown that this initial estimation was the
correct one: P3538 did pass after all, and so Chuck's assignment of
the Number 1741 to 'Restore Game Balance II' was the assignment of a
Rule Number to a Rule. That Number was therefore not available to be
assigned to 'A Public Voting Experiment'. That Rule, as the Statement
alleges, has not yet been given a Number by the Rulekeepor.

Note that this argument does not rely on interpreting the controversial
clause "...including numbers assigned to Rules later determined to
have been incorrectly enacted" in R1349 in any particular way. Given
that P3538 actually did pass after all, 'Restore Game Balance II' was
correctly enacted and so this provision was not triggered.
