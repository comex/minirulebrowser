I'm not sure what the problem is, but dfw.net seems to have lost
most of the mail sent to me in the last 36 hours or so.  If anyone
sent anything I need to see (especially proposal results), please
resend them to me.

Thanks,

This Week with R-O-M

Still 347 Rules in the current Rule set.  Here are the five random selections:

161 = Rule 1768 Evidentiary Status of Officer Reports
 47 = Rule 1551 Documents Subject to Ratification
 22 = Rule 1692 Power of Rules
164 = Rule  502 Salary for Judges
270 = Rule 1543 The Wizard

I'll select Rule 1692.  Maybe y'all don't want to limit the Power of Rules.

Acting as Executor and on behalf of the Repeal-O-Matic, I hereby submit the
following proposal:

PROPOSAL: Repeal Rule 1692 (Power of Rules)
This Proposal shall have an AI = 1

Rule 1692 is hereby Repealed.
