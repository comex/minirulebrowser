Some grepping on the mail folder in which I store Assessor's Reports
produced this, after some editing:

Thus it appears that in its two incarnations so far, the R-O-M has made
25 Proposals which actually got voted on, of which 12 were adopted.
Given the amount of work it generates for the Promotor, you're probably
right that it hasn't paid its way.

I therefore vote for Proposal 3824.

Indeed.  It does occur to me that there is a problem, in that several
offices stipulate that they bear a weekly salary while the general
salary rules stipulate that salaries be paid monthly.  Anyone want to
take a stab at resolving this apparent conflict?
<<

Well, this was obviously overlooked by the proposer of the monthly
salary (I wonder who that was... [looks around, trying to look like an
innocent bystander]).

I guess it boils down to precedence; some weekly salaries are in rules
with numbers higher than 1007 (the monthly salary rule), so these
should be paid monthly. For those with numbers lower than 1007, I
guess it is monthly payments.

Although one might try to argue that 1007 requires a monthly payment,
and the weekly salaries are paid in addition to this...

Anyway, while I did proto the original proposal without anyone
spotting the problem, I'll now propose a fix without protoing
first. H. Promotor, please note: I hereby submit the following
proposal and transfer 1 P-note from myself to the bank to raise its
priority by one:

>>
Fix monthly salaries

Amend R1670 by replacing the string "after the beginning of each Nomic
Week" with "after the beginning of each month". 

Amend rules 1607, 1449, 889, 910, 559, 1051 and 1377 by replacing
"weekly salary" with "salary" in each of them.
