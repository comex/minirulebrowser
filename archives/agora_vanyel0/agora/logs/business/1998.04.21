Heck, I'm in a generous mood today.

I transfer another Kudo from myself, because I'm leaving in May
                                     anyhow,
                        to Kolja A., for getting a B.A.  

Congratulations!

I transfer one Kudo from myself, for forgetting to vote on this
after publicly supporting it, to Steve, as the wronged party.
My apologies, Steve.
