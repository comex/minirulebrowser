Let the rules be changed by removing Rishonomic from the list of voting

IP343:

Create a rule titled "Internomic Duels" with the text:

If one Nomic believes another Nomic has insulted it or engaged in an offensive
act against it, it may (thorough its liason with Internomic) challenge the
offending Nomic to an Internomic Duel. The challenged Nomic may accept or
decline the invitation.

If the challenged Nomic accepts, the liasons of the dueling Nomics may choose
to accept certain stakes in the challenge (such as a gain or loss of points or
the ability of the victor to insert a specified rule into the loser's
ruleset).
They may also choose to accept changes to the default initial rules. Any
stakes
or changes to the rules must be accepted by both liasons, with the
exception of
starting without rule 5, which is accepted if either liason requests it.

An Internomic Duel is played by two teams of three players each, representing
the two Nomics involved. A neutral referee is also neccessary. The initial
rules are as follows, unless the participating Nomics agree to changes:

Rule 1.
Each team gets a turn in sequence. The team which gets the first turn is
determined randomly by the referee.

Rule 2.
On a team's turn, all three members of that team must agree to a change to the
rules. The referee must determine the change's legality. If the change is
legal, the referee must decide the number of points to be awarded for the
change, from 0 to 5. The change then takes place.

Rule 3.
A rule may be declared illegal by the judge for any reason. The referee need
not explain eir reasoning. Recommended reasons to declare a rule change
illegal
are:
  It would make future rule changes impossible.
  It would immediately make one team win.
  It is deliberately biased towards one team or the other.
  It removes some or all of the referee's power to determine the legality of
  rule changes or adjucate disputes.
  It detracts from the spirit of the game.
  The referee just doesn't like it.

Rule 4.
The referee is in charge of maintaining a correct record of the state of the
game. If a dispute arises during play, the referee's decision is final.

Rule 5.
The rules of an Internomic Duel are binding on all players of both Nomics
involved. The referee should declare illegal any rule change which puts an
unfair burden on the non-dueling players of either Nomic.

Rule 6.
The winner is the first team to reach 100 points.

Rule 7.
Either team may forfeit the game at any time.

Why is it that INP 343/344/345 was submitted three times ? More precisely,
was this due to a voluntary act on the part of the submitter, or to some
weird interpretation of the IN Rules ?

My votes on latest IN Proposals:

I ABSTAIN on INP 339.
I ABSTAIN on INP 340.
I ABSTAIN on INP 341.
I vote AGAINST INP 342.  (Looks like they are
                          starting to get their
                          act together.)
I vote FOR INP 343-345   (Hey, it *was* my idea
                          originally (maybe it
                          was Derek's idea too.))

Hi all,

After lurking for some weeks (no, I wasn't subscribed to the mailing
lists - I read the listserver archives that Vanyel is keeping) I would
like to try and have a go playing Agora.

I am a complete newbie to the whole idea of Nomics (and of pbem-games
in general, for that matter), so I hope you'll all bear with me when
I make the first stupid newbie mistakes.

I gather that according to Rule 869 asking to be registered as a 
player here in the public forum is all that is needed to start, so
I hereby request this registration. I will also mail the Registrar
with my email-address again, in accordance with Rule 514 (rule
number quotations courtesy of "The Categorized Rule Lists of Agora
Nomic" - thanks a lot to Chuck for providing this service!).

I've also written up some first "newbie ramblings" which I'll post to
the discussion list as soon as my registration is through.

Thanks for listening, 

Kolja A. (Klaus Herrmanns)

There are a few compelling reasons why I should become Mad Scientist:
Not only am I a genius and a moderately evil one, at that, I'm an
associate member of Evil Geniuses for a Better Tomorrow.  Never heard of
us?  Exactly. :)  What's more, have no doubt in your minds that I will
make the game highly Interesting, which as we all know is one of the
foulest curses of the Hunghungese...

I'm updating the bio page--it's rather out of date--so I'm requesting
anyone on the list (player or otherwise) to send me a list of
interesting facts about yourself... topics that are listed in the
typical bio include:

RL Name
Former aliases
Email
Snailmail (or just city/state/country)
Phone #
Homepage(s)
Current Agora Offices
Current Agora Group
Former Offices
Former Groups
Patent Titles (incl. "old" ones)
Status
Last Status Change
Other Nomics
Date of Birth
Education
RL activities
Interests
Personal info

Obviously, if you don't want to release some of this info, that's fine
too.  If you don't send me anything, then I'll just post the stuff
that's public Game info (i.e. found in the Registrar's Report)

To get a better idea of what I'm asking, you can look at 
http://www.cs.brown.edu/~dpb/agora/exbio.html, although be forewarned
that most of it is _grossly_ out of date.

Another thing: if you have a picture of yourself online, that's
relatively small, include an URL.  I won't host it, but I can link to
it. :)

And of course, if you have any other interesting categories, feel free
to include them...

This was in error. Chuck was awarded the Patent Title of Zeitgeist again,
for the unanimous passage of Proposal 3530.
