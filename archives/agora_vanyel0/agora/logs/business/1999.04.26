I'm afraid these were misnumbered.  They should have read:

You do not seem to have noticed my transfer of 0.6 P-Notes in order to
reduce its priority.  This is a COE.

Greetings,

All,

  For the record, I would like to say that I believe that Steve's
recent admissions, plus his resignation as CotC has served in my
mind to provide restitution for his actions and sufficient guarantee
of his future condict. I do not believe any other punishment beyond
that he has suffered (loss of offices) is warranted, although of
course the current CFJs will have to be resolved in a legal manner.
Therefore, I withdraw my proposal "Taking out the Trash" from the
Proposal Queue. I forgive Steve any wrong that he has done, and hold
no grudges. I will remain recused from any judgment on this issue. I
shall refrain from further comment on this matter.

Vlad
