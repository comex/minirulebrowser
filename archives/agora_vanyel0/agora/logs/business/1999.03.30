H. Promotor G. Chaos,

I hereby submit the following Proposal, paying 1.7 P-Notes to the Bank
to raise its Priority to 1.7.

####
Proto-Proposal
A Separation of Powers

This Proposal has an Adoption Index of 2.

[Comment: the basic framework is surprisingly easy to put in place,
because we already have the concepts of a Voting Entity and a Proposing
Entity defined. They seem, and probably were, made to prepare for this
kind of innovation.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rule entitled "Legislators and Voters" be
created with the following text:

      Every Player is either a Legislator or a Voter. By default, every
      Player is a Voter. Newly registered Players are Voters. 

      A Legislator has the right to submit Proposals, but may not cast
      votes on Proposals (i.e., e is a Proposing Entity but not a Voting
      Entity). A Voter has the right to cast votes on Proposals, but not
      to submit Proposals (i.e., e is a Voting Entity but not a
      Proposing Entity).

      A Voter may become a Legislator, or a Legislator a Voter, by
      announcing that e is doing so in the Public Forum, provided that
      e has not changed from being a Legislator to being a Voter, or
      vice versa, during the previous two months.

      The Registrar shall record whether each Player is a Legislator or
      a Voter, and the date and time at which e last became either a
      Legislator or a Voter, and include it in eir Registrar's Report.


Be it further resolved that R206 (Voting Entities and Votes) be amended
by deleting the text:

      Players and Groups are Voting Entities.


Be it further resolved that R766 (Groups) be amended by appending to it
a new paragraph which reads:

      Each Group is a Voting Entity.


Be it further resolved that R1605 (Proposing Entities) be amended by
replacing the text:

      Each Player is a Proposing Entity.  Other entities are Proposing
      Entities only if defined as such by the Rules.

with the text:

      A Player or other entity is a Proposing Entity only if defined to
      be so by the Rules.


Be it further resolved that R879 (Quorum) be amended by replacing the
phrase "Active Players" with the phrase "Active Voters".


Be it further resolved that R1873 (A Duty to Vote) be amended by
replacing the phrase "Active Player" with the phrase "Active Voter", and
by deleting the paragraph which reads: 

      Three months after this Rule is created, it repeals itself.
