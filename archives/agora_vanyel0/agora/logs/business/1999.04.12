I hereby submit the following proposal, and pay 1.7 P-Notes to raise
its Priority.

---

Proposal: All You Zombies... v1.3

Amend Rule 1042 (Deregistration due to Silence) to read:

      Each Player is either Noisy, Quiet or Silent. Whenever a Player
      posts to the Public Forum, or a new Player registers, that
      Player is Noisy.

      Any Player can cause another Active Noisy Player to become
      Quiet by stating that e is doing so, and clearly identifying
      that Player, in the Public Forum.  If a Player has been Quiet
      continuously for two weeks, e becomes Silent.  If a Player has
      been Inactive continuously for two months, e becomes Silent.

      Any Player can cause a Silent Player to become a Zombie by
      stating in the Public Forum that the Silent Player has
      Abandoned the game. If the Speaker is Silent, and it is alleged
      in the Public Forum that e has Abandoned the Game, e commits
      the Class A Crime of Speaker Abandonment. E ceases to be
      Speaker, and the Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker. E then becomes
      a Zombie. In either case, the Registrar shall, as soon as
      possible after an allegation in the Public Forum that a Player
      has Abandoned the game, confirm or deny in the Public Forum
      that the Player has become a Zombie.

      The Registrar shall include in eir Report the most recent
      date on which each Player changed from being Noisy, Quiet or
      Silent to any of the others.

Change the title of Rule 1042 to "Zombification due to Silence".
 
Create a rule, with titled "Zombie Masters", with text:

      Each Player who is a Zombie has a Master, who owns em. 
      When a Player first becomes a Zombie, eir Master is the 
      Bank. Zombies may only be transferred from one Master to
      another as explicitly described by the rules.

      If a Player becomes a Zombie's Master, then e is granted
      Power of Attorney for the Zombie, for as long as e remains
      the Zombie's Master. Non-player Zombie Masters are not
      granted Power of Attorney in this way.

      If a Player who owns a Zombie deregisters, all eir Zombies
      become owned by the Bank. The Registrar is required to
      announce this transfer as soon as possible after the
      Player's deregistration, and the transfer takes effect at
      the time it is announced.

      The Registrar is required to keep track of which Players
      are Zombies, and who their Masters are, and publish this
      information in eir Report.

Create a rule, with title "Zombie Auctions", and text:

      Each week, if there are any Zombies owned by the Bank, for
      which Auctions are not already underway, the Registrar 
      shall conduct an Auction for each of those Zombies. The
      Auctioneer for these Auctions shall be the Registrar. The
      Auction Currency is Indulgences, and the Starting Price 
      for each Auction is equal to the number of Blots held by 
      the Zombie being Auctioned, with a minimum value of one.

      When the Winner of the Auction is announced, e becomes 
      the Zombie's new Master. If the Auction ends without a
      winner, then the Zombie is deregistered.

      As soon as possible after the end of the Auction, the 
      Registrar shall vacate any Blots the Zombie has.

Create a rule, with title "Returning to Life", and text:

      If a Zombie Player becomes Noisy, then e is no longer
      a Zombie, and eir Master ceases to own em. 

      Unless the Zombie was owned by the Bank, the Registrar
      shall pay the Zombie's most recent Master a number of
      Indulgences equal to the starting price in that Zombie's
      most recent Auction, halved for each new calendar month
      since the end of the Auction. This payment shall be 
      made as soon as possible after the Zombie becomes Noisy.

Amend Rule 1755 (No Non-Player Responsiblilities) to read:

      When a player becomes deregistered or a Zombie, e ceases to be
      a candidate, officer, judge, or executor in probate, or in 
      general to occupy any role or position to which a Rule assigns
      any duties or powers.  Noone who is not registered, or who is
      a Zombie, may occupy such a role or position.  This rule takes
      precedence over rules which would prevent em from ceasing to
      occupy such a role or position.

      The foregoing paragraph shall not apply to the holding of Patent
      Titles, or any position which a Rule specifically says may be
      held by a non-Player or Zombie, nor shall it act to prevent a
      non-Player or Zombie from registering, calling CFJs, or doing
      things that non-Players and Zombies are generally able to do.

Amend Rule 1555 (Electees and Removal From Offices) by replacing the
text:

      If a Player goes On Hold, deregisters, or is deregistered,
      e shall be removed from all Offices e holds.

with:

      If a Player goes On Hold, deregisters, is deregistered, or
      becomes a Zombie, e shall be removed from all Offices e holds.

Create a rule, with title "Default Procedure for Auctions", and text:

      When an Auction is required and the procedure is not defined 
      elsewhere, the following standard Auction procedure shall be
      used. Details specified herein are defaults which may be 
      modified by other Rules for specific situations.

      (a) Auctioneer: The Auctioneer is the Entity responsible for 
          collecting bids and announcing the result of the Auction.
          This Entity is the Speaker if not otherwise specified.

      (b) Bidders: Every Player not on Hold may Bid in an Auction. 
          On Hold status is measured at the time a Player sends eir 
          Bid.

      (c) Auction Currency: Each Auction is conducted in one 
          particular currency. Unless otherwise specified, the Auction 
          Currency is the Voting Token.

      (d) Start of Auction: The Auction begins at the time the first 
          correct and legal announcement that an Auction is begun, as
          defined in other Rules, is sent to the Public Forum, 
          together with the identity of the Auctioneer, the Auction 
          Currency, and the value of the Starting Bid.

      (e) Starting Bid: The Starting Bid is the minimum possible
          value of a bid. If not otherwise specified, the Stating Bid
          is equal to the MUQ of the Auction Currency.

      (f) Making Bids: Each Bidder may make as many Bids as e desires
          during the Auction. Blob is way cool. A Bid is a message, 
          sent to the Public Forum, announcing that the sender is 
          bidding in that particular Auction, and the amount of eir 
          Bid. A Bid is only valid if it satisfies the following 
          conditions:

        (1) The Bid is not made before the start of the Auction, 
            or after its end.
        (2) The amount Bid is a multiple of the MUQ of the 
            Auction Currency.
        (3) The amount Bid is no less than the Starting Bid.
        (4) The Bid is larger than any other valid Bid made so 
            far in the Auction.

      (g) End of Auction: If, one week after the Auction started,
          there have been no Bids made. The Auction ends, and has no
          winner. Otherwise the Auction ends when 24 hours has passed
          without a valid Bid having been made.

      (h) The Winner: When the Auction ends, the Bidder who made the
          largest valid Bid in the Auction is the Winner. The 
          Auctioneer shall announce the Winner of the Auction as soon
          as possible after the end of the Auction, and shall issue
          a Payment Order from the Winner to the Bank, for an amount
          equal to the size of the winning Bid.

Create a rule, with title "Private Auctions", and text:

      If an Auction is designated by the rules as being Private,
      then Bids may only made by sending them privately to the
      Auctioneer. This rule takes precedence over the standard
      Auction procedure.

[Comments:

1.0 - Old Nomickers don't die...

      Silent players are no longer deregistered, but become Zombies.
      Zombies are initially owned by the bank, but are Auctioned off
      for Indulgences (which effectively go towards paying off that
      Zombie's Blots).
 
      The player who so buys a Zombie, gains its Power of Attorney.
      If the Zombie player returns to the game, its Master is 
      refunded some of eir price.

      ...the just get amended.

1.1 - If a Zombie is not bought, it is deregistered, to prevent lots
      of unwanted Zombies from being Auctioned every week.

      Fixed a bug in the refund rule (forgot to say who was being paid).

      Zombies cannot become Officers, Judges, etc.

1.2 - Cleared up a few small language problems.

1.3 - Tacked Auctions proposal on the end.

I hereby submit the following Proposal and request that it have an
Adoption Index of 2.

####
Proposal
A Separation of Powers

This Proposal has an Adoption Index of 2.

[Comment: the basic framework is surprisingly easy to put in place,
because we already have the concepts of a Voting Entity and a Proposing
Entity defined. They seem, and probably were, made to prepare for this
kind of innovation.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rule entitled "Legislators and Voters" be
created with the following text:

      Every Player is either a Legislator or a Voter. By default, every
      Player is a Voter. Newly registered Players are Voters. 

      A Legislator has the right to submit Proposals, but may not cast
      votes on Proposals (i.e., e is a Proposing Entity but not a Voting
      Entity). A Voter has the right to cast votes on Proposals, but not
      to submit Proposals (i.e., e is a Voting Entity but not a
      Proposing Entity).

      A Voter may become a Legislator, or a Legislator a Voter, by
      announcing that e is doing so in the Public Forum, provided that
      e has not changed from being a Legislator to being a Voter, or
      vice versa, during the previous two months.

      The Registrar shall record whether each Player is a Legislator or
      a Voter, and the date and time at which e last became either a
      Legislator or a Voter, and include it in eir Registrar's Report.


Be it further resolved that R206 (Voting Entities and Votes) be amended
by deleting the text:

      Players and Groups are Voting Entities.


Be it further resolved that R766 (Groups) be amended by appending to it
a new paragraph which reads:

      Each Group is a Voting Entity.


Be it further resolved that R1605 (Proposing Entities) be amended by
replacing the text:

      Each Player is a Proposing Entity.  Other entities are Proposing
      Entities only if defined as such by the Rules.

with the text:

      A Player or other entity is a Proposing Entity only if defined to
      be so by the Rules.


Be it further resolved that R879 (Quorum) be amended by replacing the
phrase "Active Players" with the phrase "Active Voters".


Be it further resolved that R1873 (A Duty to Vote) be amended by
replacing the phrase "Active Player" with the phrase "Active Voter", and
by deleting the paragraph which reads: 

      Three months after this Rule is created, it repeals itself.

Actually, only the change the the Bar will have any effect. Changing
the Batch size has to be done before Thursday in the week. It's about
time we fixed that, and the related awkwardness off the Voting Tariff

Anyway, as Acting Promotor, I intend to keep the Bar at zero, where Scott
has placed it. And I hereby set the Batch Size to four.

Indeed, that is also what my records show. So, I hereby amend the POs
avt136 and avt137 to:

  Ass#  Payor          Payee      Amt  Currency  Reason
------  -----          -----      ---  --------  ------
avt136  Vlad           Bank       2.0  VTs       Voting
avt137  Bank           Blob       0.8  VTs       Commission (P3851-52)

My apologies to Crito for stuffing his records around like this. I must've 
had my brain in neutral.

Blob
