I dispute this; the decisions were sent, apparently not received.
There may be a problem with your email, or mine; I sent mail twice
asking if you'd received my appeal decisions, without a reply.

Copies of the decisions, with copy-self headers, follow.

I am in agreement with fellow Justice Steve about the substance of
lee's Judgement, that is, to interpret "direct submission" as required
by Rule 1808 to exclude the Public Forum as a valid means of
submission.

I further agree that the fact that the Judgement would invalidate a
number of Private Orders, mostly Transfer Orders, previously thought
to have been valid should not be a primary factor in the Board's
decision. (I do not agree, however, that we might just take these
erroneous transfers to have taken place and agree to 'ignore the
errors' as has been suggested, as this would represent a radical and
unwarranted departure from Agoran tradition in taking judicial
findings into account; rather; I would hope to see most recent
Official reports Ratified so as to correct for all such errors).

I also agree that supposed conflicts with prior Judgements are not a
major issue. Not only does Steve offer some arguments to the effect
that these prior Judgements can be seen as not conflicting; I also
believe that the requirement to consider 'past Judgements' in Rule 217
must be interpreted according to the literal meaning of 'past', i.e.
'past Judgements' delivered in the recent past are by necessity of
more dubious value in guiding further Jugdgements that those delivered
several weeks, months, or years ago and which have demonstrated their
usefulness.

Where I differ with Justice Steve is in his assessment of Rule 1808 as
being, so to speak, unclear in such a way that the Judge was justified
in interpreting it as clearly having a different meaning than it was
previously thought to have. But in the discussion that has developed
since the original Judgement we have come to regard the meaning
of the Rules and its wording to have quite different meanings to 
different Players.

In this instance I believe this Board is justified in examining
lee's Judgement in the light of all factors mentioned in Rule 217,
and overturning it if overall the evidence and arguments against
overweigh the evidence and arguments for.

A crucial point offered by Judge lee in eir defense of the Judgement
(and not, as Steve note, in the Judgement proper) concerned the
wording of other Rules that might have been relevant to the
interpretation of Rule 1808, and in particular the uniqueness of Rule
1808 in including the phrase "directly to".

lee cited several Rules which require a given body of text to be
submitted to a particular Player and which have been in the past
interpreted as being satisfied by a post to the Public Forum. Judge
lee cited Calls for Appeal - not a particularly good example, as Rule
1564 explicitly require such submissions to be to the Public Forum.
Other Rules which require a given text to be "submitted to" a
particular Player are 1789, 1792, 1726, 991, 1826...

In contrast, Rule 1808 is unique in requiring a given submission to be
made "directly to" a given Player. But for this argument to be
complete, we should also turn to other Rules which are known to
require a submission to be made to a given Player, *and* prohibit such
submissions to the Public Forum. There is one instance, Rule 1859
(Secret Voting), which calls for messages to be sent to "the Vote
Collector of the Proposal, Election, or Referendum _only_." (My
italics.)

I contend that "directly to X" strongly differs in meaning from "to
X only". The former relates to the means of sending a message, while
the latter relates to the intended effects. I believe it would be
proper for a Judge to offer an interpretation of the "directly to X"
constrution, whether this interpretation is such as to include Public
Forum postings or not, but I am loath to sustain a Judgement the text
of which does not allude to an issue which later emerges as being
central to the decision.

I therefore see no option but to call for reassignment.

I hereby overturn Judge's Kolja's decision. I disagree with eir
statement that "a challenge of such custom in a CFJ is enough to
change it". If the origin of a particular custom has some basis in
interpretation of the Rules, then I contend that Rule 217 does not
allow a Judge to return a contradictory Jugement merely because of
personal preference.

I am of the opinion that "specific" and related terms, as used in the
Ruleset and with the meaning that previous Game Custom have imparted
to these terms, do not necessarily imply exact, individual
specification of an existing and narrowly identified entity.

Phrases such as "I hereby ABSTAIN on all Proposals up for Vote",
variously qualified by conditionals such as "if possible", "if I have
not already done so", or "I delegate the Assessorship to whoever is
willing to take it up for a week", have in the past been accepted as
legal. In that context of allowing 'loose' specification, which
sometimes reach absurd extremes, I fail to see why a particular Rule
should be singled out for a different interpretation.

I hereby SUSTAIN Judge Kolja A.'s ruling.  
I find eir reasoning sound and within the Rules.

I want to add to eir statement a note on logic.  If you make a
statement 'All foo are blue'  no foo need exist for this stamen to be
true.  Once you make a statement 'Some foo are blue' then for this to
be true, there must be at least one foo, and at least one foo must be
blue.
To say there are some CFJ's that are specific CFJ's where i am
ineligible to judge, the CFJ's  would have to exist in order for that
statement to be true.

be true.

anything saying i was no longer a justice.  Please explain.  When did I

I hereby SUSTAIN Judge Kolja A.'s ruling.  
I find eir reasoning sound and within the Rules.

I want to add to eir statement a note on logic.  If you make a
statement 'All foo are blue'  no foo need exist for this stamen to be
true.  Once you make a statement 'Some foo are blue' then for this to
be true, there must be at least one foo, and at least one foo must be
blue.
To say there are some CFJ's that are specific CFJ's where i am
ineligible to judge, the CFJ's  would have to exist in order for that
statement to be true.

be true.

>======================================================================

>Judgement: TRUE

>Reasons and arguments:

>The question is not new to me; the practice of making oneself
>ineligible to judge all CFJs called in a certain period of time has
>always struck me as against the letter of rule 1567. This never
>bothered me very much, as I think it is nice to have this
>possibility. I consider this an interesting example where game custom
>quietly accepted a practice that is against the letter of a rule; I
>think that a challenge of such custom in a CFJ is enough reason to
>change it and go back to the rules proper.

>I hope, however, that noone will advocate changes in past CFJ
>assignments that respected ineligibilities illegal under this
>CFJ. Anyone who thinks about doing so should have formally challenged
>the practice when it was begun.

>======================================================================

>(Caller's) Arguments:

>I begin with the general observation that being eligible to Judge a
>CFJ is a Nomic property of Players in the sense of R1011, and hence
>can only be changed by procedures specified in the Rules. Hence if the
>procedure described in R1567 for changing one's eligibility to Judge a
>CFJ does not permit Players to make themselves ineligible to Judge
>CFJs which have not yet been called (as I contend), then, since no
>other Rule specifies such a procedure, that action is simply not
>permitted by the Rules at all, and the Statement is TRUE.

>The first paragraph of R1567 itself states that:

>      A Player makes emself ineligible to be the Judge of a specific
>      CFJ by transmitting a notice to the Clerk of the Courts,
>      specifying the CFJ for which e wishes to be made ineligible.

>Attention should be drawn here to two points about this paragraph. The
>first is that it describes a procedure for making oneself ineligible
>to Judge 'a specific CFJ'. The second point is that the procedure
>described requires the the Player to specify 'the CFJ for which e
>wishes to be made ineligible'. I submit that a CFJ which has not yet
>been called and hence does not yet exist cannot meet the requirements
>of specificity in R1567. "All CFJs called in the next two weeks" does
>not name a specific CFJ, for example. Neither does "Any CFJ called by
>Chuck in the next month." Even "Any CFJ called by Chuck in the next
>three days concerning the interpretation of Rule 1567" does not, I
>claim, name a specific CFJ, even if Chuck actually makes a CFJ
>matching that description. 'A specific CFJ' can only refer to a CFJ
which already exists in the full particularity of its details: its
text, who called it, and when it was called.
