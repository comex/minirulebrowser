I deny this Claim of Error, as well as the closely-related COE
made in the message with the subject, "BUS: COE on Short Logical
Ruleset (#2)".

Rule 1322 requires that a Rule Change shall not take effect
unless the Power of the Instrument causing the Rule Change
has a Power at least as great as the Power of the Rule,
both before and after the Rule Change.

Rule 1688 specifies that the Power of any entity is zero, unless
otherwise set by the Rules.

Rule 594 sets the Power of an *adopted* Proposal equal to
its Adoption Index.  There is no Rule which sets the Power
of a Proposal which is not adopted, save 1688 itself; thus,
the Power of a non-adopted Proposal (whether a failed Proposal,
or simply one whose voting period has not yet ended) is zero.

By Rule 1322, an entity with Power=0 cannot create a Rule
with Power=1 (as Claimant suggests, for P3690), nor can it
repeal a Rule with Power=1 (as Claimant suggests, for P3691).

Rule 1322/3 (Power=3)
Effectiveness of Rule Changes

      A given Rule Change shall not take effect unless the Power of
      the instrument which specified it is at least as great as the
      greater of the current Power of the Rule to be Changed (if any)
      and the Power the Rule would have after the Change (if any).

Rule 1688/0 (Power=3)
Power

      There shall exist a property of entities known as Power.  The
      Power of an entity is an Index, as described elsewhere.

      An "instrument" is any entity with Power greater than zero.

      The Power of any given entity is zero until and unless it is set
      to another value in accordance with the Rules.

History:
Created by Proposal 3445 (General Chaos), Mar. 26 1997


Rule 594/3 (Power=1)
Proposals and Rule Changes

      When a Proposal is adopted, its Power becomes equal to its
      Adoption Index, and the provisions contained in the text of the
      Proposal are implemented to the maximal extent permitted by the
      Rules.  Provisions which are unclear, ambiguous, or inapplicable
      are ignored.  In a Proposal containing more than one provision,
      each provision is severable from the others, unless the Proposal
      states otherwise.

      For the purpose of the Rules, the application of an adopted
      Proposal is a legal procedure for changing Nomic Properties.

      The Adoption Index of a Proposal is the maximum of 1, the value
      requested by its Proposer (if any), and the value required for
      that Proposal by the Rules (if any).

[CFJ 778: It is legal for a Proposal to contain zero Rule Changes.]
