I'll just speak for myself and say again that I've been (I think) a good
CotC, and have done nothing to deserve removal from office so soon after
being democratically elected to it.

The notion that I am "suspicious" by virtue of having pursued a Scam is
frankly ridiculous.  Similar logic would bar Herald Crito, Registrar
Michael, Rulekeepor Chuck, and Justiciar Morendil from holding Office, all
of whom I consider highly honourable. (Forgive me if I've left anyone out.)

The notion that I am "greedy" by enriching myself with 1 win and 10 VTs is
a truly grotesque smear.  For comparison, Crito's wonderful scam a year ago
gave him 597 wins and 5970 Extra Votes.

Of course, some of the Impeachment forces are now saying it's a strategic
move with no justice in it.

They hope to gain Office by avoiding elections for Offices held by their
party, while forcing early elections for all other Offices.  I'm sure I've
heard someone transfer a Kudo or two for similar reasons recently.  I urge
all honourable players to reject such a reason for Impeachment, and vote
AGAINST.

I agree that this motive for Impeachment is at least slightly
dishonourable (I do at least get plenty of warning that the Elections
are coming though).  As it can not possibly affect the passage of
3710, I also urge people to vote AGAINST the Impeachments.  I'd also
like to urge Rebels to become Abiding.  (I suppose it's no surprise
that the Threat haven't managed to persuade their Loose Cannon to do
so; that's the problem with Loose Cannons :-)

Sherlock take note:

I vote AGAINST in all Impeachment Referenda in which I am eligible to
vote.

Michael.

Proposal

H. Promotor Blob,

I submit the following proposal, paying one P-Note to have its priority
increased by one.

Proposal
Limited Indulgence Distribution

Amend Rule 1712 by replacing the text:

      At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Herald shall randomly
      distribute a number of Indulgences equal to the number of Blots
      executed in the past Week, less the number of Blots vacated in
      the past Week, among all Players: for each such Indulgence, the
      Herald shall randomly select one Player and issue a Payment
      Order from the Bank to that Player for one Indulgence.  If this
      number is negative, no distribution occurs.

with the text:

      At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Herald shall randomly
      distribute a number of Indulgences equal to one less than the
      difference of the total number of Blots held by all Players minus
      the total number of Indulgences held by all Players:  for each such
      Indulgence, the Herald shall randomly select one Player and issue a
      Payment Order from the Bank to that Player for one Indulgence.  If this
      number is not greater than zero, no distribution occurs.

[Comment:  Restores the "hot potato" Blot by restricting the distribution to
one less than the total number of Blots and is automatically self-adjusting
whenever someone de-registers while holding either Blots or Indulgences.  Also,
it corrects the problem that some people might have with requiring a
distribution of zero Indulgences.]

I like this proposal, and seeing as there are already 5 props in the 
Queue with non-zero priority, I hereby spend 1 P-Note to have its
priority increased by one, to bring it to the head of the Queue.
