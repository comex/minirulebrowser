Well, I managed to get through at least most of the rules.

I hereby request Registration.

Maybe I should have waited until I was eligible for a grace period again,
but I decided that that was too long (2 months)

However, more important was the following loophole I found in the rules:
A Payment Order can be satisfied by submitting a Transfer Order - but it
does not matter whether or not this Transfer Order is effective! That is,
if there is a Payment Order ordering me to pay 1 VT to the Bank, I can
just submit a Transfer Order for that 1 VT, even if I do not have Voting
Tokens, and this will satisfy the PO.

Well, I got some more ideas while reading the ruleset, but you'll hear
of them (probably) later.

I've got a bunch of Proposals outstanding that would delete
substantial portions of the Rules.  Please feel free to support any or
all of them. :)
