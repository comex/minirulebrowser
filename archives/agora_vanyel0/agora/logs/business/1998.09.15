H. CotC,

I hereby call for judgement on the following statement, barring Lee
and Crito:

 A Recordkeepor is not required to abide by a valid Transfer Order
 under the condition that this transfer "would result in an entity
 possessing a negative quantity of Currency" (R1817). However, as soon
 as this condition ceases to be true, the Transfer Order in question
 must be obeyed.

Reasoning: While R1817 does not explicitly state when this condition
is to be checked, it also says nothing about any change in a TO's
status if this condition is true at some time or other.

Therefore, as soon as the payor of the TO has sufficient funds to pay
the TO, the situation is the same as in the standard case: there is a
valid TO around, and there is no reason why the recordkeepor shouldn't
be allowed and required to execute the TO.

As an aside, I wonder whether there is anything that would stop a
recordkeepor to make a transfer that leaves a player with a negative
amount of currency? R1817 only says that in this case the recordkeepor
is "not required to" make the transfer.

Kolja A.

I really am glad you brought this to Court.  I am quite willing to do
it that way if the Courts say that is the correct way.  Easier on me. 
It is against how i read the rules so i did not do it that way.

If you don't want to know the answer, don't ask the question.

I should note that Swann has lost the Patent Title of Miscreant as a result of
the successful Revolt and resultant Blot vacations.

Also, I should have included Proglet in the latest report.  E has 20 Kudos, 0
