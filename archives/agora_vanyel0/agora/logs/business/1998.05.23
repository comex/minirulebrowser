PROTO: Order Repair v1.2 (this proposal shall have AI=3)
------------------------------------------------------------------

Let the following rule be created with a Power=2;
(Title: Automatically Invalid Orders)

     An Order shall be invalidated upon its execution if any of the 
     following is true of it;

       i) It seeks to hinder the appeal of itself or some other Order
      ii) It seeks to hinder the stay, vacation or amendment of itself 
          or another Order.
     iii) The Order itself is in direct violation of one or more Rules.
      iv) It seeks to compel, or forbid, the performance of any duty
          required or permitted of a Player solely by the virtue of that
          Player being a Judge or Justice.
       v) It seeks to forbid any Player from submitting a CFJ, appealing
          a CFJ, or submitting a Motion.


Let the following Rule be created with a Power=2;
(Title: Precedence of Orders)

     Orders have precedence in relation to their class as follows;

       i) Administrative Orders have precedence over Private Orders.
      ii) Judicial Orders have precedence over Administrative Orders and 
          Private Orders.
     iii) Appellate Orders have precedence over all other Orders.

     An Order can only affect the operation of another Order when the 
     Order so affected does not take precedence over it.  An Order that
     attempts to do so is invalidated upon execution.

     No Order can forbid or hinder a Player from executing an Order
     of equal or higher precedence.  An Order that attempts to do so is 
     invalidated upon execution.


Rule 1796 is amended to read as follows;

      All Administrative, Judicial, and Appellate Orders executed in the
      manner prescribed by the Rules for their class and type are 
      presumed valid and enforceable until proven otherwise by CFJ.

      Any Private Order that is of a type not explicitly permitted by
      the Rules is presumed invalid until proven otherwise by CFJ.

      In order to be proven valid by CFJ, the Rules must;

        i) Permit the Player who executed the Order in question to 
           execute such an Order.

       ii) Require or permit the execution of the Order in the 
           circumstances which existed at the time it was executed.

      iii) Not explicitly render it invalid.


Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: Definition of Improper for Orders)

     An Order shall be improperly executed when it fails to conform to 
     the procedures defined in the Rules for the execution of an Order, 
     or if its content fails to conform to the strictures provided in 
     the Rules for the content of an Order.

     An Order shall be for an improper purpose if it does not conform to 
     the purpose of such an Order as broadly defined in the Rules.  The 
     following shall be the minimum considerations for determining the 
     proper purpose for each class of Order;

       i) Private Orders shall not be for a proper purpose unless they 
          are directly relevant to the personal business of the Player 
          issuing them, or to the business of entities over which that 
          player has legal control when the Order was issued.
      ii) Administrative Orders shall not be for a proper purpose unless 
          they are directly relevant to the performance of the official 
          duties of the Player issuing them.
     iii) Judicial Orders shall not be for a proper purpose unless they 
          are directly relevant to a CFJ being Judged by the Player 
          issuing them.
      iv) Appellate Orders shall not be for a proper purpose unless they 
          are directly relevant to an issue that Board is currently 
          adjudicating.

     Orders which are improperly executed, or for an improper purpose 
     are invalid.

     Orders that are improperly executed, for an improper purpose, or
     are otherwise invalid, are defined as improper Orders.

Rule 1800 is amended by appending the following paragraph;

     "If an Amendment to a valid Order would render it invalid, then the 
      Order to make that Amendment is itself invalid.

PROTO: Make Strategic Criminal Actions Truly Illegal

Let the following Rule be created with Power=3;
(Title: Pragmatizing Prohibitions)

     If the Rules forbid a Player from performing some action-- if the 
     Rules say the Player "can not," or "shall not," or "may not," 
     perform the action, or the Rules contain language to the same 
     effect-- and a Player performs such a forbidden act, then that act 
     shall not be deprived of any other legal consequences or effects 
     the Rules grant that action solely on the basis of it being 
     forbidden, unless a Rule explicitly denies the act from having such 
     effect in the circumstances in which it was made.  If an action is 
     defined in the Rules as a Crime, that action shall be forbidden by 
     the Rules.  In no case shall a prohibition in the Rules be implied 
     to claim the forbidden act to be impossible, but in all such cases 
     such acts are not legal and Players performing such acts are not 
     "abiding by the Rules."  Repeated and willful commission of illegal 
     acts is the Crime of Habitual Criminality, a Class A Crime, which 
     should only be prosecuted in the gravest of circumstances and in 
     accordance with the strictest possible standards of proof.

{Comment:  Attempts to deal with the dual problem of the pragmatic
           concern over allowing the Rules to make apparent claims that 
           some act is impossible while allowing Crimes to be true 
           prohibitions under the rules and not subject to "strategic" 
           abuses. This prevents the kind of game state flux caused by 
           past illegal acts "never happening" while still carrying the 
           strong claim of impermissiblity granted by 101, and not the 
           weaker impermissablility of the current "punishment" system.  
           This is  code that explicitly admits it can be broken-- we 
           all knew this, didn't we?-- but that stregnthens, rather than 
           weakens the criminal system.}

PROTO: Order Repair v1.3 (this proposal shall have AI=3)
------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1793 is amended to read as follows;

      An Order is a command, executed by a Player and directed to some
      entity.  It is a non-Rule entity given coercive power by other
      Rules.

      An Order may be directed to the holder of an Office or other
      official position in eir capacity as that Office or other
      official position, and in this case if the Office or position
      changes hands before the Order is satisfied, the duty to abide
      by the Order automatically attaches to the new holder of that
      Office or position.

      Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Order, the purpose of which is
      to affect the operation of a prior Order, is as valid as any
      other Order, and is said to be directed at the prior Order it
      affects.

{Comment: The language about either multiple prohibitions, or one single
          act, is needlessly constraining-- and raises some bizzare 
          problems when considering possible amendments.  It makes more 
          sense to treat them as unitary bodies of text with coercive 
          power, like a Rule, that can contain multiple provisions as 
          the situation dictates.  In the case of Orders defined by the 
          Rules, (TO’s PO’s &c.) there’s already reasonable restriction 
          on their content.}


Let the following rule be created with a Power=2;
(Title: Automatically Invalid Orders)

     An Order shall be invalidated upon its execution if any of the 
     following is true of it;

       i) It seeks to hinder the appeal of itself or some other Order
      ii) It seeks to hinder the stay, vacation or amendment of itself,
          either directly, or indirectly through hindering the stay,
          vacation or amendment of another Order.
     iii) The Order itself is in direct violation of one or more Rules.
      iv) It seeks to compel, or forbid, the performance of any duty
          required or permitted of a Player solely by the virtue of that
          Player being a Judge or Justice.
       v) It seeks to forbid any Player from submitting a CFJ, appealing
          a CFJ, or submitting a Motion.

{Comment: Fixed ii) to allow Orders to hinder the operation of other
          Orders, if that hindering still permits the stay, vacation &c. 
          of the Order in question.}

Let the following Rule be created with a Power=2;
(Title: Precedence and Authority of Orders)

     Orders are non-Rule entities with coersive power granted by this
     Rule.  If there is a conflict between Orders of different classes,
     the following precidence relations shall hold.

     Orders have precedence in relation to their class as follows;

       i) Administrative Orders have precedence over Private Orders.
      ii) Judicial Orders have precedence over Administrative Orders and 
          Private Orders.
     iii) Appellate Orders have precedence over all other Orders.

     An Order can only amend or vacate another Order when the 
     Order amended or vacated does not take precedence over it.
     An Order that attempts to do so is invalidated upon execution.

     No Order can forbid or hinder a Player from executing an Order
     of equal or higher precedence.  An Order that attempts to do so is 
     invalidated upon execution.

     An Order can stay another Order of higher precidence, but such a
     stay must be of a reasonably finite duration.

     Between Orders of the same class, the Order that was most recently 
     executed or amended shall take precidence.

     This Rule takes precidence over any Rule that would specify
     different methods of conflict resolution betwen Orders.

{Comment: Revised this to allow stays upon appeal, and to treat Orders
          as NREs, with a twist.  In order for vacation and such to be
          effective, I have reversed the “normal” precidence for NREs, 
          with later-executed Orders taking precidence.  I think this 
          makes sense given the nature of Orders, wich are more 
          transitory than Rules or SLCs.}


Rule 1796 is amended to read as follows;

      All Administrative, Judicial, and Appellate Orders executed in the
      manner prescribed by the Rules are presumed valid and enforceable 
      until proven otherwise by CFJ.

      Any Private Order that is of a type not explicitly permitted by
      the Rules, or is not pursuant to an agreement between the Player
      issuing it and the entity to which the Order is directed, or is
      not affecting such an Order, is presumptively invalid until proven 
      otherwise by CFJ.

      In order to be proven valid by CFJ, the Rules must;

        i) Permit the Player who executed the Order in question to 
           execute such an Order.

       ii) Require or permit the execution of the Order in the 
           circumstances which existed at the time it was executed.

      iii) Not explicitly render it invalid.

{Comment: Loosened the reigns on private Orders to allow for Player
          agreements, removed the “class and type” language.}

Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: Definition of Improper for Orders)

     An Order shall be improperly executed when it fails to conform to 
     the procedures defined in the Rules for the execution of an Order, 
     or if its content fails to conform to the strictures provided in 
     the Rules for the content of an Order.

     An Order shall be for an improper purpose if it does not conform to 
     the purpose of such an Order as broadly defined in the Rules.  The 
     following shall be the minimum considerations for determining the 
     proper purpose for each class of Order;

       i) Private Orders shall not be for a proper purpose unless they 
          are directly relevant to the personal business of the Player 
          issuing them, or to the business of entities over which that 
          player has legal control when the Order was issued.
      ii) Administrative Orders shall not be for a proper purpose unless 
          they are directly relevant to the performance of the official 
          duties of the Player issuing them.
     iii) Judicial Orders shall not be for a proper purpose unless they 
          are directly relevant to a CFJ being Judged by the Player 
          issuing them.
      iv) Appellate Orders shall not be for a proper purpose unless they 
          are directly relevant to an issue that Board is currently 
          adjudicating.

     Orders which are improperly executed, or for an improper purpose, 
     are invalid.

     Orders that are improperly executed, for an improper purpose, or
     are otherwise invalid, are defined as improper Orders.


Rule 1800 is amended by appending the following paragraph;

     "If an Amendment to a valid Order would render it invalid, then the 
      Order to make that Amendment is itself invalid.
