COE denied. One does not need to have been eligible when the CFJ was called,
but only when it was assigned. And while Calabresi was not a player (and thus
not eligible) when the CFJ was originally assigned on 5 August, I see no
reason why he would not have been eligible during the reassignment on 16
September.

You are possibly right, but for the wrong reasons. Rule 911 bars
from sitting on a Board of Appeals any Player who "was ineligible
to Judge the CFJ". But I think I was wrong in concurring with Steve's
assessment of 911's determination in the case of Calabresi.

I fail to find support in the Rules for the position you advocate;
Rule 698 does not speak of CFJ assignments but instead states that
for each CFJ, only Active Players who are not the Caller are eligible.
It is that Rule that determines eligibility. Its determination of
eligibility is valid at any time.

However, that Rule also says "Every Active Player is eligible to Judge 
a given CFJ unless specifically made ineligible by some Rule." As
Calabresi was never made ineligible to Judge 933 by any Rule, e is
eligible to sit on the Appeal.

Is there anything that results in the condition in 911/ii), by the way ?

      A Player is ineligible for selection if any of the following is
      true:
      ii) E has been dismissed as Justice from that Board.

This doesn't seem to be defined anywhere else...

Anyway, I hereby claim that Calabresi has Abandoned the game.

Yes - and I resent your perpetually switching the focus of the debate
from theoretical considerations to the practical when it suits you,
and you only. I offer these examples as thought experiments only, and
they are contrived because I've been asked to make them up on the spot.
But I usually do my best to keep them relevant to the situation at
hand, in that they model actual Rules or Proposals that I deem likely
to arise in actual play.

The above seems to be a standard line of defense with you, and I'm
getty pretty tired of it. It contributes nothing of value to the
discussion; if you consider entanglement of mechanistic and legalistic
provisions unlikely to happen in anything but artificial Rules, say
so, preferably stating reasons.
