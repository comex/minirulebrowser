I Judge that the Statement is TRUE. R1432 is relevant here: when an
ex-Player reregisters, e is the same Player. Since no Rule states that
a Player's Score is changed by the act of deregistration, I draw the
conclusion that a reregistering ex-Player resumes with same Score e had
when e deregistered, as the Caller alleges.

There having been no objection to the above:

I transfer 1 Indulgence from Andre to the Bank to satisfy POI697.
I transfer 7 P-Notes from Andre to the Bank.
I announce the completion of The Plan [tm]; hence Andre is no longer in
Probate.
