Whether this COE is correct or not, it certainly is not 'baseless'. I hereby
transfer 1 VT from General Chaos for baseless Kudo transferring, to Morendil,

Although I don't believe this vote will be valid (I don't really have
VTs, so the related VT TO will fail, I'm afraid) I hereby take a
cnhance and vote anyway: 

FOR 3552 (A Public Voting Experiment).

I would also like to urge the chancellor and the VT recordkeepor again
to mint some new VTs and track their circulation explicitly, so we
don't unnecessarily prolong the list of proposals that die due to a
lack of VTs.

>"All Voting Tokens were destroyed as a result of the Pragmatic

>
>======================================================================
Decision of the Justiciar: TRUE (sustaining the original Judgement)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Judge Elde/Morendil argues that during implementation of the Proposal, a
rule change caused the Mint to cease being a mintor when it was the mintor
of VTs, before another rule change made the Bank the mintor of VTs.

There are several different interpretations on how the provisions of a
Proposal are implemented, which may affect the argument.  (For example, if
the provisions are implemented simultaneously, then the Mint did not cease
to be a mintor _before_ the Bank was mintor.)

But no matter which interpretation is chosen, it remains that the Mint
_did_ cease to have Mint Authority.  CFJ 828 (Destruction of Group Coins)
teaches that this is enough to satisfy the precise wording of Rule 1579,
even if it could be shown that VTs had a mintor at every legally
significant time.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Original Judge's argument

Proposal 3533, the Pragmatic Currencies proposal, was implemented under
authority of Rule 594.  Judge Elde argues that at the time Rule 1470 was
amended (depriving the Mint of Mint Authority),  Rule 1696 still named the
Mint as the Mintor for VTs. The conclusion is that Rule 1579 acted at that
moment to destroy all Voting Tokens.


2. How the provisions of a Proposal are implemented

There are several interpretations of the Rules on how the provisions of a
Proposal are implemented.

The Sequential View:   Each provision is implemented in order, if allowed
                       by the Rules then in effect, and the Game State is
                       adjusted to include consequent effects of this before
                       turning to the next provision.

The Atomic View:       Each provision is implemented in order, if allowed
                       by the Rules in effect at the adoption of the Proposal,
                       but no consequent effects cause an adjustment to the
                       Game State until all provisions have been dealt with.

The Simultaneous View: All the provisions are considered to be implemented
                       simultaneously,  if allowed by the Rules in effect
                       at the adoption of the Proposal, except where
                       dependencies among the provisions require that some
                       are implemented in sequence with other ones.

All three of these are consistent with the Rules, and the choice between
them must therefore rest on "game custom, commonsense, past Judgements, and
the best interests of the game."

The present decision does not require us to choose among these, and thus we
refrain from expressing an opinion as to which is preferred.


3.  Destruction of Game Coins, CFJ 828

It's fair to compare the present situation to the one arising in CFJ 828.
In that case, Proposal 1760 had revamped the Group rules but had forgotten
to provide that each Group was the mintor of its own Group Coins, or in
fact that Groups were permitted to be the mintors of anything.  However, a
Rule (1467) provided that "The Mintor of a Currency is the Mint if it is
not otherwise defined."

But the clear meaning of Rule 1471, worded very much like the two most
recent forms of Rule 1579, is that when one entity ceases to have authority
to mint a currency and another begins to have that authority in its stead,
then that currency is indeed destroyed.

The judgement in CFJ 828 states:
>Rule 1474/0 clearly said that the Mintor for a Group's Coins was the
>Group. That language was amended away by Proposal 1760, and the Group
>issuing the Coins then ceased to have authority to be a Mintor, that
>authority now going to the Mint.
>
>Rule 1471/0 states that

[...]
>
>Even though a conclusion is inconvenient, the temptation of avoiding it
>by misinterpreting the Rules, or language, must be resisted.  The change

>one began having it.


Rule 1579/1 partly stated:
      If the designated Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist or ceases
      to possess Mint Authority, all units of that Currency are
      destroyed and the Currency ceases to exist.

Rule 1579/2 partly stated:
      If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist, or ceases to have
      the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that Currency
      are destroyed, and that Currency ceases to exist.


The inclusion of "designated" in Rule 1579/1 is not enough to change the
result.  The meaning of "mintor" and "designated mintor" have at all times
been the same, namely the mintor designated by the Rules.

Thus I rule that the statement was correctly judged TRUE.

However, only POs that cannot be fulfilled immediately survive. TOs
that do not find the needed currency at their source die immediately
(1598). So while salaries etc will just be paid late if you wait with
minting new currencies, votes and other things involving TOs will just
die. This is why I would really like to see some real VTs in
circulation before the currently running voting periods end.
