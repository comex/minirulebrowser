It's been quite interesting trying to cope with the various implications of
candidates being deregisted (and then getting elected), of Executors in
Probate who are not Players, etc.  But it could get quite tricky, and I
fear the game is actually close to degenerating into unjudgeable
controversy.

In the interest of clarity, I offer the following:

====================================================================
ProtoProposal
No nonplayer responsibilities

Create a rule reading:

When a player becomes deregistered, e ceases to be a candidate, officer,
judge, or executor in probate, or in general to occupy any role or position
to which a Rule assigns any duties.  Noone who is not registered may occupy
such a role or position.  This rule takes precedence over rules which would
prevent em from ceasing to occupy such a role or position.
====================================================================

Strange, the header I received showed it sent to agora-business.  But who
knows?  Just in case, I resubmit the COE message below, if it did not have
legal effect before.

Could the Notary please confirm that 
  i.  Kolja A. was not Elde's EiP on 12 November, and that
 ii.  Steve was not Blob's EiP on 13 November.

Kolja A. and Steve both tried to register their putative "wards" on
the dates given, but recent judicial activity suggests that they
weren't in a position to do so, further suggesting that Elde and Blob
are not currently registered after all.

Michael.

PS: the registration status of Players is one of the most painful
things to be uncertain about.  It makes the CotC's job a misery for
one thing.  If we are to move to a more pragmatic system in any
sphere, I'd welcome movement on this front first.

Attached therefore is a very alpha proto as to how this might be
achieved.  I welcome comments on how this might be improved.  I'm
tempted for example, to actually require that registration status only
change when the appropriate report is published, but this sort of
thing is potentially very dangerous and probably difficult to get
right.

  Three days after the Registrar publishes a report specifying the
  current status of registered players, that report becomes definitive
  for the time at which it was published with respect to Players'
  registration and Activity details, unless this report is subject to
  dispute through either the COE or CFJ mechanism.

Claims admitted. Before I act to end Swann's probate properly, I
hereby request of all Currency Recordkeepors details of Swann's
present holdings of Currencies, and any outstanding Payment Orders
naming Swann as Payor or Payee.

I believe you have forgotten Calabresi. This is a COE.

Greetings,

The time has come to reward (refund) the faithful as per my promise.  And
to brag about our victory, while slipping a bit of historical information
to our enemies for them to use against us at the next crossroad.

I hereby Transfer a Voting Token to each of Calabresi, Chuck, Michael,
Vanyel and elJefe, and, as a special bonus for great but unsuccessful
efforts, to Vir. 

Vlad's VT will be forthcoming when he reregisters. 

Also, for participation Andre and Scott should be noted, although they
both slyly adjusted their Votes when these were discovered to be
unnecessary.

Thanks to Morendil who made the Zombie Resistance's job a lot easier by
using his Speaker privileges.

Also thanks to Vanyel and Calabresi who chose to come back from their
exile to Vote. 

And Swann's declaration of Presence was welcome too..  there was a time
when I feared the Zombie Masters might be plotting to make 3581 fail
Quorum.

I just regret that there was not sufficient support for the Guillotine... 
although it might have been hard to pull off in any case.  It would have
been interesting with a scam that relied on Steve's Public Voting Rule...

Greetings,
Ørjan.
