Yes, but that was two weeks ago, and no Report, nor any sign of one, has
been forthcoming. lee simply ignored my queries about Scott's VT
holdings, even though they came from a Justice of a CFJ.

In fact, I hereby transfer a Kudo

FROM lee, for not even replying to my formal request for information,
even to say the he couldn't provide it,

TO Proglet, who, since he has returned to us, should get back the Kudo
that was taken from him just before he was deregistered.

PROTO: Let everyone have a turn v1.2

Create a rule, with title "Turns for all", with text:

     Whenever a Player is selected to judge a CFJ, e becomes ineligible
     to judge any future CFJs. If ever there are no Players eligible to
     Judge a CFJ, then all Players made ineligible by this rule become
     eligible again.

     Being made ineligible to judge a CFJ by this rule does not cause
     a Player to become ineligible to serve as a Justice on that CFJ.
     This rule takes precedence over any rule which claims otherwise.


Amend Rule 698 ("Always an Eligible Judge"), by replacing the text:

      If there would otherwise be no Players eligible to Judge a CFJ,
      then all Active Players, excluding the Caller and those Players
      Barred by the Caller, shall be eligible, any other Rule to the
      contrary notwithstanding.

with:

      If, after taking all other rules affecting eligibility into
      account, there are no Players eligible to Judge a CFJ, then
      all Active Players, excluding the Caller and those Players
      Barred by the Caller, shall be eligible, any other Rule to 
      the contrary notwithstanding.

[Comments: 

v1.0: Complementary to the recent R-O-M proposal, although not
      necessarily relying on it. We've had the same judge selection 
      mechanism for ages, and while it works well enough, it might be 
      interesting to try something new.

v1.1: Added the second paragraph, at Michael's recommendation

v1.2: Amended R698 to explicitly apply only after all other rules have
      had there say.
