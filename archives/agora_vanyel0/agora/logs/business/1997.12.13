Antimatter:  Assigned to Harlequin, who has AFAIK *still* done nothing
  about it.

Calabresi:  Just assigned to Oerjan.

ChrisM:  Assigned to Vir, who has AFAIK done nothing about it.

Vanyel:  Just assigned to Michael.

Vlad:  Assigned to you, and AFAIK you've done nothing about it.

Zefram:  Assigned to myself, and I've been waiting for the Transfer Order
  Rule to be Disinfected before attempting to do anything about it.

I hereby report that, in my opinion, the following adjustments were
made to VT holdings on July 24 as a consequence of RGB II:

Andre:		    set to 5 VTs
Antimatter:	    set to 5 VTs
Blob:		    set to 5 VTs
Chuck:		    set to 5 VTs
Crito:		    set to 5 VTs
Elde:		    set to 5 VTs
General Chaos:	    set to 5 VTs
Harlequin:	    set to 5 VTs
Kolja A.:	    set to 5 VTs
Michael:	    set to 5 VTs
Morendil:	    set to 5 VTs
Murphy:		    set to 5 VTs
Oerjan:		    set to 5 VTs
Steve:		    set to 5 VTs
Swann:		    set to 5 VTs
Vanyel:		    set to 5 VTs
Zefram:		    set to 5 VTs
elJefe:		    set to 5 VTs

(The Bank's balance is unchanged because the adjustments RGB II would
require attempt to attribute ownership of a negative number of units
of Currency to the Bank, which I deem to be illogical; those
adjustments are therefore ignored.)

Indulgence Cleanup

Next step, the 17 Indulgences created by the Chancellor were distributed by the
wrong method, therefore POI275 through POI292 were issued improperly and are
hereby vacated.  Since all of these POs were satisfied, the Rules require me to
issue the following POs to complete the vacation of the original POs:
