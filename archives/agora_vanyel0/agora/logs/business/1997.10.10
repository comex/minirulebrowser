Proto:  Plots (v1.3)


[Part One:  Rename Locations to Plots.  Discard Entities having
 Locations and Moving.]

Amend Rule 1706 to read:

     There is a class of Entities called Plots.  Each Plot has a unique
     name.  The Agoraverse is the set of all Plots.

     A Plot is Rule-Named if and only if it is referred to by name in
     the Rules.

     The Cartographor is authorized to change any non-Rule-Named Plot's
     name Without Objection.

Repeal Rule 1707.

Amend Rule 1708 to read:

     Two Plots may be Adjacent to each other.  No Plot is Adjacent to
     itself.

Repeal Rule 1709.

[Rule 1710 will be amended later.]

All Plots are destroyed.

One hundred Plots are created with the names "Area XY", where X and Y are
each digits ranging from 0 to 9.  "Area XY" is Adjacent to "Area MN" iff
one of the following conditions is true:
  X = M and Y-N = 1 (mod 10)
  X = M and N-Y = 1 (mod 10)
  X-M = 1 (mod 10) and Y = N
  M-X = 1 (mod 10) and Y = N


[Part Two:  Create land ownership.]

Create a Rule titled "Landowners" with this text:

     Each non-Rule-Named Plot has an Executor, known as its Owner; each
     such Plot's initial Owner is the Bank.

     Rule-Named Plots never have an Executor or Owner.

     A Plot's Owner may change that Plot's name Without Objection.

Create a Rule titled "Buying Land" with this text:

     When a Plot is sold, its Owner before the sale is known as the
     Seller, and its Owner after the sale is known as the Buyer.

     For a Plot to be sold, the Seller must inform the Cartographor of
     the identity of the Plot and the Buyer; and the Buyer must agree
     to the sale, unless the Buyer is the Bank.

     For a Plot owned by the Bank to be sold, the Buyer must pay 4 VTs to
     the Bank for the sole purpose of buying that Plot.

     When a Plot is sold to the Bank, the Cartographor shall pay out 2 VTs
     to the Seller.

Create a Rule entitled "Winning by Ownership" with this text:

     Owning at least half of all Plots is a Winning Condition known as
     a Win by Ownership.


[Part Three:  Create something to do with the Plots you own]

Create a Rule entitled "Mules" with this text:

     Mules are a Currency.  Their MUQ is 1.  Their Recordkeepor is the
     Cartographor.

     A Mule's Owner may transfer that Mule to any Plot e owns, or vice
     versa, by executing a Transfer Order accordingly.  However, no Plot
     may possess more than one Mule.

Create a Rule entitled "Energy" with this text:

     Energy is a currency.  Its MUQ is 1.  Its Recordkeepor is the
     Cartographor.

The Bank has 100 Mules and 10000 units of Energy.

Amend Rule 1677 to read:

     Upon the start of a Player's Grace Period, the Registrar shall
     pay out to that Player an award of 5 Voting Tokens, 5 P-Notes,
     5 Mules, and 20 units of Energy.

Amend Rule 1701 by removing this paragraph:

     Whenever there exists a Player who has never before possessed
     any P-Notes, the Promotor shall pay out 5 P-Notes to that Player.

Each current Player gains 5 Mules and 20 units of Energy.

Create a Rule entitled "Structures" with this text:

     Any Mule within a Plot may become a Structure (unless it is one
     already) when its Owner pays the price of that type of Structure
     to the Bank.  Unless otherwise specified, the price is 4 units of
     Energy.

     A type of Structure exists only if the Rules explicitly define it.

     The following types of Structures exist:

       * Farms
       * Houses
       * Mines
       * Churches

     A Structure ceases to be a Structure when its Owner informs the
     Cartographor that it does so, or when it is no longer within a
     Plot.  At that time, its Owner receives half the price of that
     type of Structure, rounded down.

Create a rule titled "Upkeep on Structures" with this text:

     Monthly upkeep on Structures is equal to 2 units of Energy for the
     first Structure of each type, plus 1 unit of Energy for each
     additional Structure, except as otherwise specified.

     If an Owner does not pay the upkeep on all of eir Structures
     within one week of the beginning of the month, all of eir
     Structures collapse and are destroyed.

Create a rule titled "Production from Structures" reading:

     At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall pay
     out each Structure's Production to its Owner (if its Production
     is greater than zero).  Unless otherwise specified, each Structure's
     Production is as follows:

       * Farms - 5 VT
       * Houses - 1 P-Note
       * Mines - 2 units of Energy

     Churches have no Production.  However, each Church is considered
     to be two players for the purposes of randomly allocating
     Indulgences, and any Indulgences which would be given to a Church
     are instead given to its Owner.

Create a new Rule titled "Proximity of Plots" and this text:

     A Farm's Production is increased by 0.5 VT for each House or
     Church to which it is Adjacent, and decreased by 1 VT for each
     Mine to which it is Adjacent.

     A House's Production is increased by 1 P-Note for every 2 Farms
     to which it is Adjacent.

     A Mine's Production is increased by 1 unit of Energy for every
     two Houses to which it is Adjacent, and decreased by 1 unit of
     Energy for every two Farms to which it is Adjacent.


[Part Four:  Amend the Rule defining the Cartographor and eir duties]

Amend Rule 1710 to read:

     There is an Office of Cartographor. The Cartographor recieves a 
     salary equal to 2 times the Basic Officer Salary.

     At least once each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall post a 
     Report to the Public Forum containing the following information:

       * all Plots, and which Plots are Adjacent to which others
       * the Ownership of all Plots
       * all changes in Plot Ownership since the last Report (if any)
       * the ownership and location of all Mules
       * the ownership of all units of Energy
       * all Transfer Orders and Payment Orders specifying Mules or
         units of Energy since the last Report (if any)
       * what type of Structure (if any) each Mule is
       * all cases of a Mule becoming or ceasing to be a Structure


[Part Five:  Authorship]

Harlequin, Blob, and Antimatter become Authors of each Rule created or
amended earlier in this Proposal.


[Part Six:  Clean up other references to Locations]

Amend Rule 869 by removing the following paragraph:

     When a Player registers, eir Location is the Welcoming Center.

Amend Rule 1016 to read:

     At any time, each Player shall either be On Hold or Off Hold.
     This status shall not be changed except as specified in the
     Rules.

     When a Player registers (or reregisters), e is Off Hold.

     An Off Hold Player becomes On Hold when e says so in the Public
     Forum.

     An On Hold Player becomes Off Hold when e says so in the Public
     Forum; however, any attempt to do so within 96 hours after e last
     went On Hold is ineffective.

Amend Rule 1664 by removing the text "whose Location is the Beer Hall".

Amend Rule 1367 by adding this paragraph:

     "Granting a Degree" and "awarding a Degree" are synonymous.  A
     Player who has been awarded a Degree possesses that Degree.

Repeal Rule 1711.

I wrote this before Oerjan made his Proposal.  Should that pass, I'll
obviously be modifying this.  But I'd like to see that people don't keep
terminal estates alive for long periods.

PROTOPROPOSAL
Dezombify Probate

Create a Rule, titled "Procrastination in Probate" with the following text:

When any player correctly posts to the PF that an entity has been in
Probate for 28 days or more, the Speaker becomes that entity's new Executor
in Probate (EiP), unless e was already the entity's EiP, in which case the
Clerk of the Courts becomes the new Executor in Probate); simultaneously
the old EiP ceases to be the entity's EiP.  This assignment is carried out
in place of the usual assignment by the Notary, and this Rule takes
precedence over any Rule that would have the Notary assign the position.

When this happens, the old Executor in Probate has committed the Infraction
of Procrastination in Probate, which bears a penalty of 1 Blot and reported
by the new EiP.

In addition, the new EiP is authorized to vacate any PO naming the entity
as payor.  Further, those PO's which e does not vacate shall be deemed to
be no longer disputed for the purposes of Probate, and e shall as soon as
possible execute the steps of the Probate Code and terminate the estate.
This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would prevent em from
vacating such PO's or excuse em from performing the steps of the Probate
code or terminating the estate.

      It is the responsibility of each Active Player to ensure that e
      is able to receive messages sent to every medium which the

      inability of a Player to receive a Public Forum does not deprive

I hereby transfer one Kudo from Andre for mailing his entire inbox to the
list, which took me at least fifteen seconds to download on my T3 and
thirty seconds to open on my Pentium Pro/200, to Orjan for being the life
of the party.
