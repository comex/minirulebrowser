I (as Registrar) did not issue any Payment Orders on 2 August 1998.  I
did issue some on the 1st, at 14:46 UTC. 

The following looks dodgy:

VT2686   02_Aug_98   06:29:08 PM   0.8   Blob   Bank   Blob

The time stamps for the Payment Orders you have me making on 14 August
are wrong.  Rather than being at 18:58:01, they were at 08:57:44.  Or
are you still using non-UTC times?  

Some of your times have AM/PM after them, others don't.  What
conclusion should be drawn from:

VT2599   25_Jul_98   03:11:05   2.0   Harlequin   Bank   Voting
?

PROTO SC-2
Spring Cleaning

[Corrections of various errors found during Read the Ruleset Week, and
a few found while preparing this Proto.

I have not included capitalization in this, although it is a mess.
That may be a separate Proto.

I also did not try to standardize between "a SLC" and "an SLC".
I _did_ include corrections of "he/his" to "e/eir".

I have divided the Proto into "Basic grammar and spelling", which
should be fairly uncontroversial changes, and "Various", which may or
may not be so.

I'll check what AI this needs at a later stage.

2: Many changes, mostly removing provisions that have become
unnecessary due to other Proposals.  For a while I kept track of newly
introduced errors as well, but I have mostly given up on this - I did
find one by chance during the latest check.  The Proto title is no
longer fitting, alas, but maybe I can get this proposed before it
becomes so again.]


Part 1: Basic grammar and spelling


Amend Rule 478 ("The Public Forum") by replacing "annoucing" with
"announcing", by replacing "the Rules calls" with "the Rules call",
and by adding a period after "specifies otherwise".

Part 2: Various


Amend Rule 1023 ('Definition of "As Soon As Possible"') by replacing

      (i)  if the action is one that a Player is required to
           perform in the course of carrying out Official
           duties, then the Player is required to perform the

           action performed in the course of carrying out Official
           duties.

indices helps.]

[2: Rule 1645 was disinfected.  Provision removed.]

[2: Rule 1659 was amended by the Electee reform.  Provision removed.]

Amend Rule 1626 ("Applications") by replacing the paragraph reading

      If a Player Executes an Application which contains Signatures
      added to it in a manner inconsistent with this Rule, e commits
      the Crime of Application Fraud, a Class D Crime.

with

      If a Player Executing an Application claims that the Application
      contains certain Signatures, but the purported Signatures have
      not been added to it in a manner consistent with this Rule, e

that an Application cannot contain illegal ones.]

Amend Rule 1756 ("Delinquent Judges") by replacing the paragraph
reading

      A Judge recused for delinquency commits the Infraction of
      Judicial Delinquency, which bears a penalty of 2 Blots to be

with

      A Judge recused for delinquency commits the Infraction of
      Judicial Delinquency, to be reported by the Clerk of the Courts
      and bearing a penalty of 2 Blots.

Infraction.]

If the last and second last paragraphs of Rule 1575 ("Standards of

[2: Rule 1682 was repealed.  Provision removed.]

Amend Rule 1714 ("Lawlessness") by removing the text ", or which would
allow em to reregister".

[The Pardoning system does not work due to this.  It doesn't help
having a precedence clause when the lowered-numbered Rule you are
trying to trump also has one...]

Amend Rule 1747 ("Pardoning Lawlessness") to read

      The Clerk of the Courts has the power to Pardon Lawless Players.
      The Clerk may not exercise this power more than once per Nomic
      month, and may not Pardon the same Player twice in a given term
      of office (although, if re-elected later, e may again Pardon
      that Player).  The Clerk of the Courts Pardons a Player by
      announcing e is doing so in the Public Forum. Then the following
      events shall occur:

        1) The Clerk of the Courts shall request the Herald to
           eliminate all Fugitive Blots owned by the Pardoned Player,
           and the Herald shall do so as soon as possible.

        2) The Clerk of the Courts may, if necessary, vacate any
           Payment Orders for Indulgences possessed by the Pardoned
           Player's estate in order to reduce the number of Blots
           possessed by the Player's estate to below the threshhold
           for Lawlessness. The CotC may not Vacate Payment Orders for
           X number of Indulgences if Vacating PO's for a lesser
           number of Indulgences would suffice to render the Player no
           longer Lawless.

        3) After the above two actions have been completed, the Player
           may reregister.

        4) The Pardoned Player shall then post a Formal Apology to the
           Public Forum for eir Lawlessness. The CotC may include a
           list of up to ten Prescribed Words in eir Pardon.

        5) A Pardoned Player is not subject to Persistent Indebtedness
           penalties for three months after being Pardoned, but during
           this period e must apply all Indulgences received (from
           any source) to eir debt and may not transfer them to
           another Entity.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule governing Lawlessness,
      Fugitive Blots, when a deregistered Player may reregister, or
      Persistent Indebtedness.

["He/his" and some bad timing requirements have been changed.
2: Steve had some comments on the substance of this Rule, however, I
believe that is beyond the scope of this Proposal, so no change due to
this.]

Amend Rule 1439 ("Blots Due to a CFJ") by replacing the text

      The Player who initially called for the CFJ has the Legal
      Responsibility to report Blots due to the CFJ to the Herald

      If such a Judgement is overturned upon appeal, then the
      Player who received Blots shall lose the same number of
      Blots as were given due to the initial Judgement of the
      CFJ.  The Player losing the Blots has responsibility for
      reporting that loss to the Herald.

with

      The Player who initially called for the CFJ shall make the
      Payment Orders necessary to apply the Blots.

      If such a Judgement is overturned upon appeal, then the Player
      who received Blots shall vacate the Blots that were given due to
      the initial Judgement of the CFJ. 

[Fixes a missing period and makes the Rule PC compliant.]

Amend Rule 1658 ("Tainting the Speaker") by replacing "permitted to
call such a Referendum" with "authorized to call such a Referendum".

[With all the Rule 116/1011 debates I don't feel that the word
"permitted" has enough weight for this purpose.]

[2: Rule 681 was amended.  Provision removed.]

Amend Rule 1590 ("Maintainer of SLCs") and Rule 1531 ("Administrators
and Their Duties") by replacing each instance of "Compact" with "SLC".

[Old terminology.]

[2: Rule 1651 was repealed.  Provision removed.]

I claim that this is an error. There are no Rebellious players, as R1664
says that all Rebellious Players become Abiding after a successful Revolt.
Also, the dates for the last CfR and the last successful Revolt need to 
be updated.
