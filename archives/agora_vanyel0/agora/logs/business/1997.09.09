Courtesy to the Chancellor

The P-Note Payment Orders recently executed by the Wizard have been assigned ID
numbers as follows:

ID#     Date of Execution        Amount   Payor        Payee        Executor
------  -----------------------  ------   ------------ ------------ ----------
POP004  09/09/97 10:13:04 +0100     1     Bank         Blob         Wizard

POP006  09/09/97 10:13:04 +0100     1     Bank         Steve        Wizard


Hope this makes the Chancellor's life easier.

Delegated Offices do _not_ return to the original holder when the Term
expires.

You were not the CotC, and so you cannot resign. This is a COE.


Although, it would be somewhat amusing to discover that I actually sent my
Appeal decision to the right person anyhow, and so I didn't need to do
this Indulgence trade...

Greetings,
Ørjan.

Misanthropist members, H. Notary -

I hereby resign as a member of the Misanthropists' Group, naming to
succeed me as Vizier, if that is legal, Chuck if e is willing, and
failing that Swann if e is willing.

I observe a respectful pause in homage to the neat ideas that the
Misanthropists' Group inspired while I was a member, and later its
Vizier, as well as to be sure that I am now no longer a member. ;)

(Note: in the following 'AEEOBO' is an abbreviation for 'As eir
Executor & on behalf of'.)

I hereby designate the following text, delimited by '---', as an
Application to create an Organization of class Group :

---
We the undersigned applicants hereby create an Organization of the
class Group, named 'The Voodoo Lounge', the initial members of which
shall be all of the undersigned, the initial Ordinancekeepor and
Vizier shall of which shall be Player Morendil, the following SLC
being its initial Ordinances :

Ordinances of The Voodoo Lounge

I. Vizierhood and Membership

The Group's Vizier, also known as Baron Samedi, shall be Player
Morendil. In the event of eir deregistration, any Member so willing
shall become the new Baron, at which time this Ordinance shall
amend itself, replacing the name of the previous Baron with the
name of the new Baron.

Members shall be divided into two classes, Zombies and Loa. Any
Member, the Executor of whom is another Member, shall be a Zombie;
all other Members shall be Loa. No Player may be a Member unless
eir Executor is also a Member; any Member not meeting this requirement
shall be immediately expelled from the Group.

Any Player may become a member of a Group at any time, with no
restrictions beyond that provided in the Rules.

II. Decision process

All Group activities occurring under these Ordinances, including,
but not limited to, amending the Ordinances, exercising the Group's
authority to Vote on Proposals, expelling Members or extending
invitations to prospective Members, drawing from the Group's
Treasury, and animal sacrifices, shall be subject to the following 
procedure.

Any Loa may at any time submit an Invocation by sending it to all
other Loa not On Hold, who may deliberate on the Invocation for a
period of up to seven days before signifying their approval, or
disapproval, to the Baron. An Invocation shall be effective, subject
to any other limitation in these Ordinances, if a majority of Loa
approve, and unless the Baron, within the period of deliberation,
should Veto an Invocation. If there is a tie the Baron shall cast
a deciding Vote.

An Invocation shall take effect when all Loa have signified their
opinion, or at the end of the period of deliberation, whichever is
sooner.

III. Special considerations

The Baron may at any time exercise the Groups' authority to Vote
on Proposals, and may at any time expel a Member, but shall otherwise
be subject to the above procedure and any other limitations herein.

Once an Invocation directing the Group to Vote on a particular
Proposal takes effect, no Member may submit an Invocation to
Vote on the same Proposal, nor shall pending Invocations to
Vote on the same Proposal take effect even if approved by a
majority of Loa, nor shall the Group Vote otherwise for any
reason.

The Baron shall be responsible for submitting the Group's Vote
to the appropriate Officer(s), as long as the Invocation directing
the Group to do so takes effect a reasonable time before the end
of the relevant Voting Period. This shall be done by notifying
the Assessor in the usual manner.

A Member may at any time transfer funds to the Group's Treasury
without the need for an Invocation to be reviewed.

A Member submitting an Invocation for an animal sacrifice shall
in all cases be responsible for implementing such.

---

I hereby add my Signature to this Application.
AEEOBO Elde : Elde adds eir Signature to this Application
AEEOBO Elde, Elde AEEOBO Blob : Blob adds eir Signature to this
Application.

I hereby Execute the above Application.

I also said _an_ Indulgence. I don't need to trade more at the moment. 
(After Michael's recent post, whether I actually need 1 remains to be
seen. But the deal with Vir stands in any case.)

I hereby transfer 1 Indulgence to Steve.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

     An Absentee Vote is a Vote cast by a Player whose location is not
     the Voting Booth.

     As soon as possible after an Assessor's Report is published, the
     Cartographor shall pay out 1 VT to each Player who cast at least
     one Vote, but no Absentee Votes, since the previous Assessor's Report.

Create a Rule entitled "Propose from the Soap Box" with this text:

     An Absentee Proposal is a Proposal made by a Player whose Location is
     not the Soap Box.

     As soon as possible after a Promotor's Report is published, the
     Cartographor shall pay out 1 P-Note to each Player who made at least
     one Proposal, but did not make any Absentee Proposals, since the
     previous Promotor's Report.

I hereby declare presence in the election of Notary..

There... now *THAT* should go to the Assessor :)

I think that rule should be fixed... why do I have to tell the Assessor
when I'm declaring presence?

I am willing.

As required by Rule 1531, I hereby inform the Notary of the
following changes with respect to the Misanthropists' Group:

I am now the Administrator, Executor, and Maintainer of the SLC.
The Jurisdiction of the SLC has changed, in that it no longer
