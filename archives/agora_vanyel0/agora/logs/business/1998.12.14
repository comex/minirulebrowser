I remind the Chancellor (whoever that may be) that the Bank has a 
large outstanding P-Note debt, and that e is liable to receive a Penalty
for Persistant Indebtedness if e does not pay it soon.

H. Assessor Blob,

I hereby vote as follows:

3816: 2xAGAINST; by all means rotate Judgeships - but don't let the CotC
simply select the Judge for each CFJ as e sees fit. Players must be able
to trust the results of the Judicial system.

3817: FOR
3818: 2xFOR
