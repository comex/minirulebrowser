I hereby allege that Morendil is Lawless and should be deregistered for
Lawlessness under Rule 1714.

I transfer one Kudo FROM Harlequin, for being annoying in changing my
address, TO Blob, for being Zombified.

I transfer all of my assets to the Order of the Evil Eye, for safekeeping
until my return.

I deregister (again).

"Safekeeping". Right.

Hmm.  Interesting interpretation.  I think this better be put to a CFJ for
clarity's sake.  H. CotC, I hereby make the following Call for Judgement.

Rule 1714 should be interpreted such that an allegation of Lawlessness sent to
the PF must contain an explicit declaration that a particular Player is
Lawless.

Relevant Rules: 1714

Arguments:  Unfortunately, I can't think of any better argument at the moment
other than "intention".  Clearly R1714 was intended to make the reporting of
Lawlessness optional (and slightly dangerous).  Scott's interpretation makes
the reporting of Lawlessness mandatory and opens the Herald up to being
prosecuted for a Class A crime if e makes a mistake in reporting someone's
Blots while having no intention of alleging Lawlessness.

Hmm, this gives me an idea for another argument.  To "allege" something
requires intent on the part of the alleger.  The fact that the commission of a
crime can be inferred from someone's statement of fact does not mean that
someone has alleged that a crime has been committed.  Simply reporting a number
of Blots does not clearly identify the Herald's intentions wrt Lawlessness and
therefore cannot be considered equivalent to an explicit declaration that a
Player is Lawless.

I read "the reasons" as meaning more than just "a reason".

The natural way to interpret it is "the legal reasons, as above".

The only alternative I see is to interpret it as "all reasons", something
which is going to be a monumental document.

So, with this becoming more and more of a dispute every minute, will
someone else join my Appeal, or should I make a separate CFJ on the
interpretation of Rule 1565?

This Misanthropists' Group Ords are severely out of date,

I hereby resign from the Misanthropists' Group, as per Rule

I note that the Jurisdiction of the Misanthropists' Group

This is not an Emergency Proposal, as it is not Disinterested. This is a
COE. I would suggest a Guillotine instead. 


Incidentally, it should not surprise anyone that I intend to delay, to the
maximal legal extent necessary, my Judgement of the two revenge CFJ's that
were assigned to me, to allow this Proposal to take effect first, if
possible.

The effect of this Proposal is peculiar. I don't think it removes already
committed PI Infractions; However, it removes their penalty, which I
suppose works just as well, although in that case they should be reported
sometime before December to get them out of the way while they are free.

Or perhaps it does succeed in removing the Infractions themselves, with
the help of Rule 1586.


A small can of worms to ponder: Does the presence of a paragraph like the
above succeed in making a Rule not define an entity/property? After all,
the definition is still part of the Rule's text. If not, then the above
Proposal might still be ineffective, witness e.g. the way paragraph 4 of
Rule 1503 is worded:

      There are no Crimes or Infractions outside those defined in the
      Rules.  If a Rule defines a Crime or Infraction without
      specifying an explicit penalty, or a class of penalty that is
      defined in the Rules, then that Crime or Infraction imposes no
      penalty.

However, paragraph 1 uses the opposite wording, assuming an active Rule:

      The Rules can penalize Players for performing, or failing to
      perform, some specific action.  Such penalized actions, or
      failures to act, are defined as either Crimes or Infractions.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

>======================================================================

We really need to figure out exactly what R108 prohibits. If this is
going to provide amnesty for PI debts incurred as the result of VT
destruction, it is going to have to be baldly retroactive in effect.
Given the current wording of R108 that may well be legal. I don't
think it's particularly desirable.

####
Proto-Proposal
Properly prohibit retroactivity

Be it hereby resolved that the text in R108 which currently reads:

      No Rule Change may take effect earlier than the moment of the
      adoption of the Proposal in which it is contained, if it is a
      proposed Rule Change, or the moment of the adoption of the
      current form of the Rule which requires the Rule Change, if it
      is a non-proposed Rule Change.

be replaced with text which reads:

      No Rule may have effects earlier than the moment it came to
      have its current text.

[Comment: Note that this leaves in the current provision "No Rule
Change may have retroactive application", which prevents Proposals
from enacting Rules in the past and so circumventing my new provision.]

I'd transfer a Kudo from Antimatter at this point, but, uh, that doesn't
seem to work, does it?

We're, uh, honored.

I take it that I can't reregister Antimatter again until November?

You meant that it *is* disinterested.  Claim admited.  Proposal 3568 is *not*
an Emergency Proposal.  Thanks for pointing that out, Oerjan.

The relevant portions of text should have read:

D  3568 G. Chaos 1 PI Amnesty
Proposal 3568 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
