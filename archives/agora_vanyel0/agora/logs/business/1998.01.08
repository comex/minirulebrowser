I hereby call for the Appeal of this Judgement, on the grounds that
it has not clearly be shown that the wording of Rule 1729 is such
that it is possible, but illegal, to cast Votes in a manner not
consistent with its strictures, whereas at the same time it seems to
be customary to treat Rules such as the late 1741 as making it 
impossible, rather than illegal, to cast Votes in a manner other than 
prescribed therein.

I hereby call for the Appeal of this Injunction, on the grounds that 
"I'm" and "tree!" are not single words. :-P

OFF: Blots due to CFJ 1078

Interesting.  I note that in this case, this seems to be a descriptive
statement rather than an actual PO.  R1439 does not require Steve to execute a
PO, it only requires em to report the amount of the penalty.  R1504 requires
the Judge to issue an Injunction requiring the CotC to execute the PO needed to
assess the penalty.  In the meantime, it is my opinion that Morendil's Blot
holdings have not been changed in any way by CFJ1078 and the above related
Player actions.  This stuff needs to be cleaned up.  (I haven't had a chance to
see if Scott's Omnibus Reform handles this.)

I also note that Blob did not issue the Injunction required by R1504, so I
guess it's necessary to appeal to append this Injunction, as per R1725.  I
hereby call for an appeal to append to CFJ 1078 the Injunction required by
R1504, requiring the CotC to issue a PO for one Indulgence from Morendil to the
Bank.

I'm not sure what effect this can have.  Although the appeal itself is well
defined, the ability to initiate this kind of appeal is not.  R1564 covers the
appeal of an existing Injunction, but not the appeal of a missing one.
