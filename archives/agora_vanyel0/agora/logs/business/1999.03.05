I hereby submit the following Proposal:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal Chuck0122
Down with Proposal Numbers!

[The title of this Proposal is somewhat facetious.  I don't mean to
suggest that the Promotor should cease to assign numbers to
Proposals--only that e no longer be required to do so, and that
Proposal numbers lose any legal significance.  CFJ numbers have
*never* been required nor had any legal significance, and they've
worked just fine.]

This Proposal shall have AI=2.

Be it resolved, that Rule 109 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 376 be amended, by replacing the
paragraph which currently reads

      If the message sent by the Assessor announcing the results of
      the voting on a Proposal also contains the results of voting
      upon other Proposals, all such Proposals shall take effect at
      the same time, but in order by increasing Proposal Number.

with a paragraph reading

      If the message sent by the Assessor announcing the results of
      the voting on a Proposal also contains the results of voting
      upon other Proposals, all such Proposals shall take effect at
      the same time, but in the order in which they were distributed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1036 be amended, by replacing the
sentence which currently reads

      This publication shall include the number, title, priority, and
      time of proposal, for each proposal in the Queue.

with a sentence reading

      This publication shall include the title, priority, and time of
      Proposal, for each Proposal in the Queue.

[Actually, this "number" is left over from when Proposals received
numbers as soon as they entered the Queue.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1430 be amended, by replacing the
text reading

      (that is, the Number of the Proposal and the Entity that
      proposed it, or Rule-- or other entity-- which mandated the
      Change)

with text reading

      (that is, a reference to the Proposal and the Entity that
      proposed it, or Rule or other entity which mandated the Change)

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1770 be amended, by replacing the
paragraph reading

      The Promotor shall distribute each proposal in the batch to the
      Public Forum, accompanied by its Number and the identity of its
      Proposing Entity.

with a paragraph reading

      The Promotor shall distribute each proposal in the batch to the
      Public Forum, accompanied by the identity of its Proposing
      Entity.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I transfer 1 P-Note to the Bank in order to raise the priority of
the above Proposal.

Chuck
