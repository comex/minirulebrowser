Re: BUS: FOIA request, to all Currency Recordkeepors

Indulgences:  Elde has -9 Indulgences.
              favor left the game with 3 Blots, which under the old rules
              would become -1 Indulgence if e were to reregister at this time.
              It's not clear to me if this has become a Fugitive Blot or not.
