I don't know how many of you read the Internomic mailing list, but 
recently there has been much talk thereon about internomic war. Some
people seem quite keen to give it a try. Naturally there has been
some talk about defence, and I explained a bit about how our Senate
works. But in the middle of the explanation I realised we had a 
somewhat critical weakness. Naturally, I didn't publicise the fact,
but it's not too hard to work out. And considering the current interest
in war, I thought it might be a good idea for us to fix the problem
before it is exploited by another Nomic.

The problem is this: While the Senate can stop an invasionary proposal
from passing, it relies on the Speaker to make it a Senate Proposal
first of all. If the Speaker is not co-operative, the defence is useless.

Now we know from experience that it is not terribly difficult to get
your own Speaker in place. Various groups have done it in the past. 
Just elect a sympathetic Speaker-Elect and then hold a Rebellion. 
Now, I don't really mind this, so long as it is done by powers inside 
the game, but I'd rather we could prevent invaders from taking advantage
of it.

Another problem is with the increased discretionary powers given to 
Officers. If an invading army captured certain key Offices, they could
make life very difficult for us, Senate Proposals or no.

What I propose is simply this - extend the Senate's powers to cover
Elections and Referenda, in the same way that they cover Proposal 
voting. That way we can prevent invaders from grabbing the important
Offices in the first place.

-----

Protoproposal:
Beef up our defences

Amend Rule 1717 (The Senate) to read:

      A Senator is any Player who has been registered continuously for
      the immediately preceding two months.

      At any time during the Voting Period of a Proposal, Election
      or Referendum, the Speaker may make it a Senate Vote, by stating
      so in the Public Forum. If that does not happen, it is not a 
      Senate Vote.

      Entities other than Senators cannot Vote on Senate Votes. If an 
      Entity other than a Senator has already voted on a Proposal, 
      Election or Referendum by the time it becomes a Senate Vote, 
      eir votes are cancelled.
     
[Comments: 

 v1.0: Generalised the Senate rule to cover Elections and Referenda 
       as well as Proposals. (We could really do with so general
       terminology to apply to all three of these things.)

In that case, I shall increase the Tariff again.

Actually, I'm not sure about the legitimacy of the last setting. I did 
it on Saturday, well after the midnight Thursday cut-off time, and I'm
not really sure if the rule allows changes made after Thursday, and
before the beginning of the next week.

Now how much should I set it to?

Lessee... with the current arrangement of Offices, we have 8 Officers
getting a total of 13 BOS, plus 7 unemployed getting 3.5 BOS, thus we
are paying out a total of 16.5 VTs/week. Plus the Distributor's wage,
is 17.5 VTs/week.

Let's say that we will continue to distribute only about 2 Proposals
a week. And half the Players vote on them. That's 15 * Voting Tariff
a week. 17.5 / 15 = 1.16666 - for the sake of a little bit of scarcity,
I'll round up to 1.2 VTs. I won't push for quite as much scarcity as I
would have before, as now our current holdings are a good deal smaller
relative to the BOS.

I hereby set the Voting Tariff to 1.2VTs. This will come into effect
on Proposals distributed from next week onwards.

Blob

PS: Something interesting to be noted here: the nett payout of salaries
depends on the distribution of Offices. The smaller the group of players
who control the Officers, the more unemployment benefits need to be paid,
so the greater the outflow.
