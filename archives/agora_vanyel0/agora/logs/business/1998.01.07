Steve says that P-Notes are not doing anything interesting, I agree.
His solution is to abolish them. I say that this is throwing the baby
out with the bathwater. The reason why P-Notes are boring is because
nobody is using them. And nobody will, as long as free Disinterested
Proposals are around. Here is a proto-proposal to fix that.

For all those who are working on the Plot's proto: If you ever want 
to see your ideas go anywhere, you should vote for this proposal,
and against Steve's. No matter how complex a system you invent, an
economy will never develop if people can get all the things they 
need for free. There need to be at least two different commodities
of value in order for trading to happen. The obvious two are VTs and
P-Notes. Without P-Notes, I think plots are likely to be a non-event.

Steve argues that only a small group of players actually propose.
Good! This means that there will be an imbalance in demand for P-Notes
and there is potential for interesting trading to take place. 

We have been taking slow steps towards a working economy around here.
Let's not shrink away from it when it is so near.

Proto-proposal: No Free Proposals

Repeal Rule 1623 ("Disinterested Proposals")

Amend Rule 1036 ("Making and Distributing Proposals") by replacing the
paragraph:

      As Soon As Possible after the receipt of the Proposal, the
      Promotor shall distribute it to the Public Forum, accompanied by
      its Number, the identity of its Proposing Entity, and a clear
      indication of whether the Proposal is Disinterested.

with:
      As Soon As Possible after the receipt of the Proposal and the
      payment of its Petition Fee, the Promotor shall distribute it
      to the Public Forum, accompanied by its Number, the identity of
      its Proposing Entity.

[Comment: The Petition Fee must be paid before the proposal is distributed]

[Comment: The amendments below simply remove all references to 
 (Dis-)Interested proposals in the ruleset.]

Amend Rule 1723 ("Sanity") by replacing the paragraph:

      A Proposal is Sane if the text of the message wherein it is
      submitted explicitly states that it is a Sane Proposal, and it
      is not Disinterested.

with:

      A Proposal is Sane if the text of the message wherein it is
      submitted explicitly states that it is a Sane Proposal.
 
Amend Rule 1724 ("Emergency Proposals") by replacing the paragraph:

      A Proposal is Emergency if the text of the message wherein it is
      submitted explicitly states that it is an Emergency Proposal,
      and it is not Disinterested.

with:

      A Proposal is Emergency if the text of the message wherein it is
      submitted explicitly states that it is an Emergency Proposal.

Amend Rule 1729 ("Insanity") by replacing the paragraph:

      An Interested Proposal is Insane, if it contains no minuscule
         letter.
      (That is the opposite of CAPITAL, for those who know not
         better.)

with:

      An Proposal is Insane, if it contains no minuscule
         letter.
      (That is the opposite of CAPITAL, for those who know not
         better.)

Amend Rule 1678 ("Encourage Proposals by New Players") by replacing
the paragraph:

      If an Interested Proposal passes, and that Proposal was
      submitted by a Player within that Player's Grace Period, then
      the Assessor shall pay out to that Player an award of 3 Voting
      Tokens, over and above any other award that Player might also
      receive for that Proposal.  This Rule takes precedence over
      Rules that would prevent this award.

with:

      If a Proposal passes, and that Proposal was submitted by a 
      Player within that Player's Grace Period, then the Assessor
      shall pay out to that Player an award of 3 Voting Tokens, 
      over and above any other award that Player might also receive 
      for that Proposal.  This Rule takes precedence over Rules 
      that would prevent this award.

[Anyone know why this precedence claim is here?]

Amend Rule 1047 ("Patent Title of Zeitgeist") by replacing the paragraph:

      When an Interested Proposal Proposed by some Player is adopted
      with no votes cast AGAINST it, that Player is awarded the Patent
      Title of Zeitgeist.  All current holders of the Title of
      Zeitgeist lose the Title whenever it is newly awarded.  The
      Assessor is responsible for detecting and reporting the awarding
      of this Patent Title.

=====================================================================

                               CFJ 1078

     "Morendil violated Rule 1729 by voting on Proposal 3640 in the
      Public Forum."

======================================================================

I concur with the Steve's argument in calling this judgement. Morendil
has clearly violated rule 1729. I have little to add to the points 
Steve has already made.

I will say that if, when a player retracts eir vote, e really has not
voted at all, then this makes for a very complicated interpretation of
such rules as 452. How is the Vote Collector to know in advance which
voting messages are actually votes, and which are not? A much more
sensible interpretation, and, I believe, the one shown by strong game
custom, is that all such messages are indeed "votes", at least for a 
time.

With regard to Morendil's intention at the time of voting, I notice that
Rule 1575 only pardons those who were ignorant of the Crimes they were
committing. [Aside: why is that paragraph in there twice?] As this case
is a plain rule violation, and not a Crime, this consideration does not
apply.

As I think it is beyond reasonable doubt that Morendil violated rule
1729, I hereby judge this statement to be TRUE.

------

By the power invested in me, by Rule 908, I hereby issue an Injunction
that Morendil submit a Formal Apology using the following Proscribed Words:

Insanity, inanity, profanity, calamity, Yosemite, perimetry, gee, I'm, a, tree!

------

I also remind Steve, that by rule 1439 he is legally responsible to
report Morendil's 1 Blot penalty to the Herald.
