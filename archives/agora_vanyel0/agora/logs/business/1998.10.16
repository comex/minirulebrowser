Oops, I nearly sent this to Blob personally. But voting has become
public again, so I hereby cast one vote for P3795.

Although in principle I would support a radical move like Scott's
"Restore Sanity", I would have preferred this proposal to allow groups
to vote, and some how I still hope we can get the current system to
work, even though the accountor has a hard time at the moment. 

So for the moment I'd prefer to search for less radical ways to ease
the accountor's job (which P3795, at the moment, doesn't do, becasue
of the 0 VT PO bug !). For example, would it help to issue voting POs
only once a month? Probably not too much, I guess. What about monthly
salaries?

I hereby submit the following Proposal and pay 2 P-Notes to raise it's
Priority by 2.

####
Proposal
A Duty to Propose

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "A Duty to Propose", be
created with the following text:

      Every Player has a Public Service Status which takes exactly one
      of the values: Served, or Required to Serve. Initially, every
      Player's Status is Served. The Promotor shall maintain a list of
      all Players, including for each Player eir Public Service Status,
      and the date at which eir Status last changed to Served, or the
      date at which e last submitted a Proposal, whichever is later. The
      list shall be sorted on this date, from earliest to latest, with
      ties being broken alphabetically. The Promotor shall include this
      list in eir Promotor's Report.

      As soon as possible after the beginning of each Week, the Promotor
      shall select the two Active Players not in their Grace Periods
      highest on the list (at the time of selection) who are not already
      Required to Serve, and change their Statuses from Served to
      Required to Serve, by announcing this change in the Public Forum.

      Any Player who is Required to Serve continuously for 14 days has
      their Status changed to Served and commits the Infraction of
      Failure to Propose, incurring a penalty of 1 Blot and 1 P-Note, to
      be detected and reported by the Promotor.

      Whenever any Player submits a Proposal, eir Public Service Status
      changes to (or remains as) Served.

This message contains one or more Proposals.  Each Proposal begins
immediately after a line marked "**START PROPOSAL" and ends
immediately before the first following line marked "**END PROPOSAL".

The following Proposal is to be titled "Oh, what a tangled web...."
and is to have Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 478 be amended to read:

      (a) A Public Forum is any medium of communication so designated as
          such by the Registrar.

      (b) The Registrar may designate any medium as a Public Forum, or
          revoke such designation from a medium already so designated,
          Without Objection.  However, The message which is to
          effectuate the change intended must be sent via a medium
          which is a Public Forum both before and after the
          designation or revocation, in order to have legal effect.

      (c) Every Active Player shall ensure that e is able to receive
          messages sent to every medium which the Registrar has
          designated as a Public Forum.  However, the temporary
          inability of a Player to receive a Public Forum does not
          deprive that medium of its status as a Public Forum.

      (d) Any message conveyed by one or more Public Fora is deemed to
          have been sent to the Public Forum.

      (e) The above notwithstanding, any message sent, by any medium or
          combination of media, to every Active Player so that each
          Active Player is reasonably certain to receive it, is deemed
          to have been sent to the Public Forum, but only if it bears
          a clear indication that it is intended to be a Public Forum
          message.

      (f) Whenever the Rules require a Player to "announce", "post", or
          "distribute" some communication or notification, that Player
          shall do so by sending it to the Public Forum, unless the
          Rules specify otherwise in that instance.


**END PROPOSAL
