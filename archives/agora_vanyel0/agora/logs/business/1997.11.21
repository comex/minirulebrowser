I was under the impression that EST was five hours behind GMT, therefore
my Judgement was delivered at 03:17:34 +0000 right?  That would be over

I was under the impression that Steve's actions to vacate these POs as Swann's
EiP were successful.  Was this not true?

I believe this means that when Michael is now Speaker; he was elected
Speaker-Elect on Wednesday (19 Nov 1997 17:30:21 +1100), and thereupon
became Speaker, and the Speaker-Elect office is once again held temporarily.

H. Promotor Crito:

I hereby propose the following:

==========================================
Proposal
No nonplayer responsibilities

Create a rule reading:

When a player becomes deregistered, e ceases to be a candidate, officer,
judge, or executor in probate, or in general to occupy any role or position
to which a Rule assigns any duties or powers.  Noone who is not registered
may occupy such a role or position.  This rule takes precedence over rules
which would prevent em from ceasing to occupy such a role or position.

The foregoing paragraph shall not apply to the holding of Patent Titles, or
any position which a Rule specifically says may be held by a non-Player,
nor shall it act to prevent a nonPlayer from registering, calling CFJs, or
doing things that nonPlayers generally are able to do.

==========================================

{ Comment:
(1) We had a nonPlayer Candidate, Speaker-Elect, and Executors in Probate,
and now a nonPlayer Justice.  This Rule would clarify those cases so that
they could be replaced by Players.

(2) The additional paragraph is to incorporate the suggestion of allowing a
Rule to explicitly say that a nonPlayer could hold some position.  It also
avoids the unintended interpretations of applying the rule to Patent
Titles, or to nonPlayers generally who are in the "position" of having the
power to register or call CFJs (for example). }
