>Sorry ;)

Actually, I checked and the recent tax levy did *not* include a PO for
Sherlock's estate, although it should have.  I'm afraid my first pass at a tax
computation caused Sherlock's tax to be less than the MUQ and I forgot to add
em back into the computation on my next pass.  So, technically, Sherlock's
Probate *is* complete.

Checking the Rules, I see the tax POs *must* be included in the tax levy
announcement (a restriction that I think should be lifted).  This means my
original announcement was incomplete and I have not yet satisfied the
requirements of R1853.  I think, however, that the POs issued for that tax are
valid.  I will now reissue a corrected version of the tax levy announcement,
including the original POs, with the disclaimer that they are informational, as
opposed to new POs, and include the missing PO.  I hope this will satisfy even
the "nit-pickers", the only other option is to vacate all of the original POs
and then reissue them.

This will have the effect of putting Sherlock back into Probate.  Notary
Murphy, please appoint me as Trustee again.  After all, it was my own screw up.

Corrected tax announcement

I hereby levy a tax on VTs of 33%.  The following payment orders
were issued for this tax:

Antimatter - 2.9 VTs to the Bank.
Blob - 1.9 VTs to the Bank.
Chuck - 3.9 VTs to the Bank.
Crito - 8.1 VTs to the Bank.
elJefe - 1.9 VTs to the Bank.
G.Chaos - 2.9 VTs to the Bank.
Harlequin - 2.5 VTs to the Bank.
Kolja A. - 7.4 VTs to the Bank.
macross - 2.2 VTs to the Bank.
Michael - 9.8 VTs to the Bank.
Morendil - 2.9 VTs to the Bank.
Murphy - 1.9 VTs to the Bank. 
Oerjan - 2.4 VTs to the Bank.
Steve - 3.7 VTs to the Bank.
Swann - 5.2 VTs to the Bank.
The Order of the Evil Eye - 3.8 VTs to the Bank.
Threat - 0.3 VTs to the Bank.
X Group - 1.7 VTs to the Bank.

The Bank - 25.2 VTs to the Bank.  ***Chancellor Michael, note this***

The following payment order is now issued for this tax:

Sherlock is hereby ordered to pay .1 VTs to the Bank.

H. Ambassador Kolja,

In accordance with R1635, I hereby submit the following Statement
for Judgement in InterNomic:

Statement:

      The phrase "unless otherwise specified", as it appears in Rule
      214, means "unless otherwise specified by the InterNomic Rules".

Argument:

My argument is essentially the one propounded by Henry Towsner. It is
difficult, if not impossible, to completely eliminate all ambiguity
from natural language. Therefore context and a shared set of values,
customs and interpretative norms must be used to disambiguate, and
they are usually sufficient to do so. In this case, the context makes
it sufficiently clear that the Statement is true.

Evidence:

Rule 214:

      All business to be conducted with a member nomic shall be
      conducted with the liaison to that nomic unless otherwise
      specified.  No entity may be liaison to more than one member
      nomic.
