Proto: Standing Down (v1)

Create a rule with title "Standing Down" and text:

     During the Voting Period of an Election, any Candidate for that
     Election may stand down, by posting a message to the Public 
     Forum to that effect. The player is then no longer to be 
     considered a Candidate for that Election. Any further votes
     cast in eir favour are invalid, and e cannot win the Election.

     When a player stands down, e has the option of transferring all
     votes so far cast for em to another Candidate in the Election,
     if one exists. To do so, e must explicitly state which Candidate
     e is transferring eir votes to, in the same message as the 
     announcement that e is standing down. Any votes transferred in
     this fashion will be considered to be cast for the receiving
     Candidate.

     This rule takes precedence over other rules for determining the
     Winner of an Election.
