          not less than zero.

      (b) When a Player registers, eir Honour is set:
        (1) to twenty Kudos, if, for the three months immediately
            prior to eir most recent registration, that Player was not
            at any time registered as a Player; otherwise,
        (2) to whatever eir Honour was at the time e was last
            deregistered.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) The Office of the Herald is hereby established.

      (b) The Herald shall receive a salary equal to twice the Basic
          Officer Salary.

      (c) The Herald's Report includes the following:
        (1) the Honour of every Entity that has been a Player at any
            time within the last three months, and the changes thereof
            since the last posting of the Herald's Report, including
            the reason for such change provided by the Player which
            initiated it, if any.
        (2) The Currency Records for Indulgences.
        (3) A list of all Fugitives from Justice, and the number of
            Fugitive Blots attributed to each such Fugitive.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Any Player may, twice in each week, transfer a Kudo from one
          Player to another (thereby reducing the Honour of the first
          by one, and increasing the Honour of the second by one), by
          Public Forum Announcement, provided the following conditions
          hold:
        (1) the Player whose Honour is to be increased is not the
            Player causing the changes;
        (2) the Player whose Honour is to be decreased has at least
            one Kudo;
        (3) the Player causing the transfer has neither transferred a
            Kudo away from the Player whose Honour is to be reduced,
            nor transferred a Kudo to the Player whose Honour is to be
            increased, at any prior time during that Nomic Week; and
        (4) the announcement sets forth a reason for the transfer.

      (b) The Herald may, once in each month, increase the Honour of
          any Player by one, by Public Forum Announcement, provided
          the following conditions are met:
        (1) the Player whose Honour is to be increased is not the
            Herald; and
        (2) the announcement sets forth a reason for the award.

      (c) This Rule does not in any way prohibit other Rules from
          defining other means by which a Player's Honour may be
          changed.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) A Samurai is a Player whose Honor is more than thirty Kudos.

      (b) Whenever a Player is a Samurai, that Player has at least as
          much Honor as every other Player, and that Player does not
          already hold the Patent Title of Shogun, that Player is
          automatically awarded the Patent Title of Shogun.

      (c) The Patent Title of Shogun is revoked automatically from any
          Player who holds it if e ceases to be a Samurai.

      (d) Thie Patent Title of Shogun shall not be awarded or revoked
          except as specified in this Rule; this Rule takes precedence
          over any Rule which would permit otherwise.

      (e) The Herald shall announce in the Public Forum whenever a
          Player receives or loses the Patent Title of Shogun, as soon
          as possible after such award or revocation occurs.
