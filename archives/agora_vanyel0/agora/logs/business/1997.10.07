Clerk of the Courts take note: 
  there is an Injunction attached to this Judgement that requires 
  you to act.

Statement: 

  "General Chaos committed the Crime of Wrongful COE denial."

Judgement: TRUE

Reasons and arguments:

This Judge finds that, in stating that Harlequin's message "I transfer
4 VTs to the Bank, to satisfy VT POs 1040 and 1041" failed to satisfy
payment orders VT1040 and VT1041, and then denying a COE asserting the
opposite, General Chaos committed the Crime of Wrongful COE denial.

As the caller of the CFJ claims, it is legitimate to interpret
statements such as Harlequin's generously, to wit that the transfer
made be considered two separate Transfer Orders, one for each of the
two Payment Orders he was required to satisfy. 

This is in line with recent judicial (and appelate) decisions which
allow Transfer and Payment Orders to be made implicitly, and
represents a welcome shift towards a less pedantic style of play.

Injunction: 

By R1504/5 I am required to enjoin the Clerk of the Courts to execute
whatever Payment Orders are necessary to penalise General Chaos for
the Crime he has committed.  (R1431 states that Wrongful COE denial is
a Class 1 Crime, and R1505 states that such crimes bear a 1 Blot
penalty.)

Michael.

Results of CFJ 933

Based on Steve's recent post, it appears I do not need to wait for the official
announcement of results on CFJ 933.

Therefore, since there were no Indulgences in the Bank at any time since the
passage of PC, and since the update to the Rules which changed the method of
Indulgence distribution actually failed due to lack of VTs, *all* posts to the
PF issuing Payment Orders for Indulgences issued by the Herald's Office with
the Bank as Payor misrepresented the actual game state.  This is a COE.  Lack
of Indulgences also caused all transfers based on these POs to fail.

I hereby admit this COE and do hereby vacate all Payment Orders for Indulgences
issued by the Herald with the Bank as Payor.

Whether or not this works, here's a proto anyway to fix it.

Proto-Proposal:  Clarify Movement

Amend Rule 1707 by replacing "where it Moves to" with "which Location
it Moves to".

Nothing causes Elde to stop being Blob's Executor in Probate,
  thus Elde is still Blob's Executor in Probate.
R1478 (Executors must be Players) trumps R1738 (EiP == Executor),
  thus Elde is no longer Blob's Executor.
R1478 (Players are eir own Executors, except as otherwise stated) is no
longer trumped by R1738 (EiP == Executor),
  thus Blob is eir own Executor.  Would someone like to inform em?

Unlike Zefram, I claim that R1478 (Executors must be Players) continuously
trumps R1738 (EiP == Executor).

And Morendil is still Elde's EiP and Executor.  Too bad; I would've liked to
declare that Elde's new Executor in Probate is Blob...

My decision on the Appeal of CFJ 933 is to SUSTAIN the original
Judgement, TRUE.

R&A:

First, I agree with Justice Vir that VTs were destroyed even
if the "atomic" paradigm (wherein a Proposal represents only
a single game state change, although the effects of that change
are as if the provisions were applied sequentially) were
the correct one; as well as with his basis for that decision.

As for the question of whether the "atomic" or "sequential"
paradigm is correct, I cannot decide--based on any of the
four preferred standards of Rule 217 (Game Custom, common sense,
past judgements, the best interests of the Game)--and since
I do not need to decide in order to judge this Appeal, I choose
not to.  However, I will make some lengthy comments on my
inability to decide. :)

I began writing these R&A with the intent of coming down
in favor of the sequential model.  Along those lines,
I had written:

>However, I agree with Steve that the annotations and Amendment
>Number of Rule 1551 establish a Game Custom that the "sequential"
>paradigm--wherein each provision of a Proposal is applied
>individually, and the Rules may act on the intermediate

>two "amendments" from a single proposal as two distinct
>amendments.)
>

>to mean "a change to the text of a Rule."  Given this
>definition, if the atomic paradigm held, two alleged

>only one amendment.  

However, I realized there is a flaw in this reasoning.
I will bring it up below, but there is another issue
I wish to address first.

>Second, the possibility has been raised that the Rulekeepor

>(This is also supported, I believe, by Rule 1575, "Standards
>of Proof".)

As I obliquely allude to above, not all Game Customs are
of equal strength.  Rule 217 provides four preferred
standards for judgement but does not (IMO) provide
any sort of order in which those standards should be
applied--a Judge is free to give precedence to whichever
standards e thinks best.  However, one thing a conscientious
Judge ought to consider, in deciding how to apply the
standards, is that some Game Customs are stronger than
other Game Customs.  A Judge might decide, for example,
that a strong Game Custom is to be preferred over common
sense, but common sense is to be preferred over a weak
Game Custom.  (This is a bit of an oversimplification--not
all common sense is equally strong, either.)

I will not go into a detailed dicussion of what constitutes
"strong" versus "weak" Game Custom, but there are two
issues which I believe are relevant.  First, how many
times has the Game Custom been applied?  A Game Custom
applied dozens of times is stronger than one applied only
once or twice.  Second, how carefully has the Game Custom
been scrutinized in the past?  A Game Custom which led to
a win, for example, or a player deregistration, is likely
to have been very carefully scrutinized, and thus is stronger
than a Game Custom with no major effects, which may not
have been closely scrutinized.

Returning to the issue at hand, we find that we have
only a very weak Game Custom supporting the sequential
view--there is only one example (Rule 1551), and amendment
numbers and Rule annotations are not likely to be closely
scrutinized.  However, even a weak Game Custom can
be decisive, if none of the other standards of Rule 217
apply.  There are no (to my knowledge) past judgements
on this issue, and common sense does not seem to prefer
either view over the other.  I personally hold the
"best interests of the game" standard in low regard,
and choose to place even a weak Game Custom above this
standard, but even if I did not, I do not see that
either one of TRUE or FALSE would be better for the
game than the other.

And so I was about to argue that the sequential view was
the correct one, as noted in my first quoted argument,
until I realized the flaw.  (Note that the second
argument, concerning the possibility of Rulekeepor
error, hinges on the first: if the atomic view can
support counting two alleged amendments in a single
proposal as two actual amendments, the second argument
is irrelevant.)

I wrote that since "Amendment" was not clearly defined
in the Rules, it had to be given its normal definition
of "a change to the text of a Rule."  However, this
does not fit with another Game Custom--the custom
that a Null-Amendment is a valid, legal Amendment.
This, IMO, is a moderately strong Game Custom--although
it also resides in the poorly-scrutinized area of
Amendment Numbers and Rule Annotations, it has been applied
many times.  Given this, we cannot define "Amendment"
simply as "a change to the text of a Rule."  A likely
definition is "Any alleged amendment to the text of a
Rule by a Rule or adopted Proposal, not prohibited by
the Rules."  Given this definition, two alleged amendments by a 
single Proposal may be two actual amendments, even under
the atomic view.

Thus, I find no reason to prefer the sequential model to
the atomic, or vice versa, under any of the preferred standards
of Rule 217.  If this CFJ hinged on that issue, I would have
to make a decision based on any other standards I cared to
apply, but since it does not (VTs are destroyed in both
models), I leave the issue to future CFJs (or, perhaps
preferably, legislation).

Rule 217/3 (Power=1)
Judgements Must Accord with the Rules

      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however,
      if the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the
      Statement to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider game
      custom, commonsense, past Judgements, and the best interests of
      the game before applying other standards.

Rule 1551/4 (Power=1)
Documents Subject to Ratification

      The ratification of an Official Document conforms the Game State
      to what it would be if the valid Official Document thus ratified
      was completely true and accurate at the time of the Document's
      publication in the Public Forum.  In other words, the State of
      the Game, upon such ratification, becomes that specified within
      the Document, plus all subsequent legal changes between the time
      of its publication and its ratification.

      All Game State changes due to the ratification of an Official
      Document occur at the time of such ratification; no retroactive
      effect is expressed or implied.

      A Document, once ratified, is for all legal purposes a true and
      accurate report.  The Game State it references may not be
      retroactively modified prior to the time it was published in the
      Public Forum, even to reflect a prior mistake, retracted or
      illegal move, or an Injunction.  This Rule takes precedence over
      any Rule that would allow such retroactive alterations or
      corrections to the Game State.

      In no way does the ratification of a Document invalidate,
      reverse, alter or cancel any prior moves or transfers, even
      unrecorded or overlooked ones.  Nor does the ratification of a
      Document change the legality or illegality of any prior move.
      Ratification only adjusts the actual Game State to conform to
      that perceived by the Players and Officers in Official
      Documentation.

      After a Document has been ratified, the Player in charge of
      maintaining that Document shall annotate all subsequent
      publications of that Document with the date of publication of
      the last such publication that was ratified..
