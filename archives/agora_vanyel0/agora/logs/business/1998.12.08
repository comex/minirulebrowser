Since I need some resolution to this soon ('cause I have to publish a
report). I hereby Call For Judgement on the statement:

     The Voting Period for Proposals 3810-3812 ended between
     07:18:33 (GMT) on December 4 and 07:59:20 (GMT) on December 7.

Caller: Blob

Argument:
---------

When P3809 took effect, it set the Voting Period to seven days. Proposals
3810-3812 were distributed on Mon, 30 Nov 1998 at 07:29:29 (GMT).

Now there are, as far as I can see, three possible hypotheses as to
when the Voting Period on these proposals ends:

     i) Seven days after they were Proposed,
        at 07:29:29 (GMT) on Monday, December 7.

    ii) Ten days after they were Proposed,
        at 07:29:29 (GMT) on Thursday, December 10.

   iii) At the time P3809 took effect,
        at 07:55:39 (GMT) on Monday, December 7.

Now I don't have any particular opinion as to which of these is
true, but I note that it doesn't make much practical difference whether
it is (i) or (iii), as no votes were cast during this period. The
times mentioned in the Statement are the times of the last recorded
vote before (i) and the first recorded vote after (iii).
