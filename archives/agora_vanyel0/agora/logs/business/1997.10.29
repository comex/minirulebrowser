"The time has come", a Sad Walrus tells me, "to talk of many things.
Of Rules and rights and Rebellion, and Officers and Wins."

Since I first registered in Agora, I have seen the Ruleset almost
double in length.  The number of Rules, not quite keeping pace, has
increased from 184 to 285.  That is, over a two year period we have
almost doubled the number of concepts that make up Agora, and codified
them in increasingly long and complex Rules.  One unfamiliar with Agora
might suppose that in such a large system, growing so fast, there would
be many Rules that do not function properly, and that we'd spend all
our time trying to fix what we have.  Yet amazingly we do not preoccupy
ourselves with bugfixing, and find time to add yet more complexity.

I now understand how we manage this remarkable feat.  It is not by
writing good Rules, nor by limiting changes to those regarded as `safe'.
Nor is it by fixing bugs quickly and accurately.  We have a much simpler
solution: we ignore the problem.  This is completely effective, letting us
get on with the game, without having to worry about anything so mundane
as making the Rules make sense.

But that's not what I play nomic for.  I see quite enough of this attitude
in real life, and abhor it.  I play nomic to escape from reality, to take
delight in communally constructing a formal system that makes conceptual
sense, and works, in addition to being interesting.  I'm surprised to find
that not even one other Player shares -- or even supports -- this goal.

Agorans, as far as I can tell, delight in complexity, and wouldn't dream
of writing a Rule so simple that it actually *works*.  Here, by `works',
I don't mean `performs its intended function', though that is part of it.
I'm referring to making a system so clear, so simple, that it has no
choice *but* to work.  This style of drafting seems to have gone out of
fashion after "Name is Agora".

Agorans love white elephants.  No matter how many Walruses may exist,
the number of white elephants in the Ruleset will always seen greater.
Wins, Rebellion, the three part Speaker Transition, Locations, Style.
These are all meaningless except to themselves.  But an Agoran couldn't
possibly condone abolishing any of them.  They're traditional, apparently
(and I thought this was a nomic).

We have more than enough of that in real life.  Daylight Saving Time, the
British monarchy, the Church of England.  MS-DOS.  Maybe it's because I'm
British -- we have a thousand years of elephant building to cope with --
but I'd much rather get away from all that when playing a game.

What conclusions can I draw from the above?  One, that, despite
all predictions to the contrary, Agora can go on growing like this
indefinitely, with no risk of collapsing under its own weight -- it will
only attract more Players to prop it up.  And two, that I am not suited
to Agora.

So why have I been playing it for more than two years?  In part, because
I thought my aims of refinement to be compatible with most Players'
aims of inventing more interesting widgets.  It has become clear, over a
number of occasions, that it is not, and in fact the Agoran electorate
will not tolerate any attempt at legislation outside the confines of
the latest fad or a new toy.  To date, the only proto of mine that has
been received with anything approaching enthusiasm has been the Fork,
a blatant (though particularly interesting) white elephant.

But I can accept all that, because I also play Agora for the interaction.
Perhaps because I'm so bad at it in real life, I take pleasure in the
processes of discussion and negotiation that go on around the game.
Although a totally informal system, the posting and commenting
on proto-proposals always seemed a particularly good system, and
interestingly one that never caught on in the zsh development group
(which in many respects I find to be like a nomic, one in which my aims
are widely shared).

However, recently we have witnessed a complete breakdown of the system.
Not merely a deadlock in negotiation, but a failure at a higher level --
a refusal of one party to even enter negotiations.  The active promotion
of, and widespread support for, Proposal 3578 makes it clear that other
Agorans consider whatever I might suggest in the matter of Rule 1042 to
be of no value whatsoever.  Not even any potential to have value.

I have been accused of paranoia on this point, so I wish to explain my
reasoning.  Let us suppose, hypothetically, that, in the eyes of other
Agorans, my contributions to the matter of R1042 are worthwhile.  This is
consistent with statements made concerning my first proto.  However,
if this were the case, then Steve, on discovering that negotiations had
not yet concluded, would have disowned eir premature Proposal.  At the
very least, e would not have Voted FOR it, or urged others to do so.
This theory, therefore, is inconsistent with the facts, and therefore
false.  Second theory: suppose that Agorans have come to a reasonable
conclusion that they can never agree with me on any aspect of R1042.
This would explain the behaviour over the Proposal, but does not explain
why my proto was praised and partially adopted.  So this, too, is false.
The only viable theory that remains is that some Agorans bear a personal
grudge against me; I can see no other explanation for the recent events.

I note that this theory, if applied to my previous Proposals, would also
explain a lot, rather more consistently than the conclusions I drew above
concerning Agoran tastes.  When I have tried to Propose large changes,
they have always been opposed on the grounds that they are too extensive,
or don't go far enough, or both.  Yet when Scott Proposes changes on a
similar scale, the thresholds magically part, and the Proposal is adopted.
(You'll never convince me that Power to the People was any less complex
than my (conceptually very similar) Intertia proposal.)

Either I was right about Agorans disliking the very things I seek to
put into the Ruleset -- order and simplicity -- or I am right about
there being a personal grudge.  Either way, Agora and I don't get on.
Either way, I should never have believed all those blatantly inconsistent
excuses.

At this point, a diversion, for the attention of our esteemed Assessor.
I hereby transfer 0.9 VT to each of the following:
    * Rule 113
    * the Vototron
    * the Kudo that favor once identified to be buzzing
    * Plato
    * Vladimir Ashkenazy
    * Benjohn Barnes (<benbar@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>)
    * the fyshbowl (room CS017a at the University of Warwick, U.K.;
        contact address <csuwr@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>)
    * Larry Wall
    * Screaming Lord Sutch
I hereby transfer an amount of 1.3 VTs to itself.  I hereby transfer
all my remaining units of Currency, except for 2 VTs, to Peter Suber.
I hereby transfer one VT to my other VT.  I hereby transfer my final
remaining VT to the VT that it now owns.

And for the attention of the Herald: I hereby transfer one Kudo from
Steve, for refusing at repeated opportunities to even consider discussing
points of disagreement, to Vanyel, for consistent service as Archivist.
I also hereby transfer one Kudo from General Chaos, for authoring the
Proposals that I rank as the five most ill-conceived pieces of Agoran
legislation ever to be adopted, including one to which I object on
metagame grounds, to Andre, for persistent honourability not adequately
reflected by eir Honour.

113 beckons, but I shall not heed its call just yet.  I shall linger a
moment longer.  One glorious infinitesemal moment to savour the beauty
of non-standard analysis.

And now the time has come.  I must proceed back to the Limbo from whence
I came.  In my opinion, to be a Player under the present conditions is a
penalty worse than deregistration.  I therefore hereby deregister rather
than continue to play.  I hope I've offended everyone I intended to.

I hereby transfer two VTs from myself to the bank to satisfy the above
payment order.

I must admit that I'm a bit annoyed about this penalty, though. While
it is formally correct, I did not even know I had been elected
Ambassador until the Registrar's report appeared - there might have
been nominations sent to the registrar in private emails. I would have
preferred the registrar not to report this infraction - it was e who
posted the election result too late for me to react and publish a
report last week. 

I also consider this a weakness of the rules, though: one, the timing
of the officer transition is tied to the end of the election, not the
publication of the election results - this makes such problems
possible in the first place. Two, the obligation to report should be
modified for weeks in which an officer transition occured. Partly to
avoid unintentional infractions like mine, but also because I think
that as it stands, 1686 requires every player who holds an office even
for part of a nomic week to publish a report - so my predecessor as
Ambassador, Steve, could also have commited the FtR infraction if e
didn't publish a report (which I won't check...).

Kolja A.

P.S. Having read zefram's deregistering note I understand why the
Registrar's report didn't come earlier, and am glad it came at all, in
fact. The penalty is still annoying, but playing out such weaknesses of
the rules is part of the fun, isn't it?

This is a Claim of Error.  The Herald's Offfice did produce a report for the

The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of

AFAIK, no Herald's Report has ever been successfully ratified.

<<

I hereby transfer two VTs from myself to the bank to satisfy the above
payment order.

I must admit that I'm a bit annoyed about this penalty, though. While
it is formally correct, I did not even know I had been elected
Ambassador until the Registrar's report appeared - there might have
been nominations sent to the registrar in private emails. I would have
preferred the registrar not to report this infraction - it was e who
posted the election result too late for me to react and publish a
report last week. 

I also consider this a weakness of the rules, though: one, the timing
of the officer transition is tied to the end of the election, not the
publication of the election results - this makes such problems
possible in the first place. Two, the obligation to report should be
modified for weeks in which an officer transition occured. Partly to
avoid unintentional infractions like mine, but also because I think
that as it stands, 1686 requires every player who holds an office even
for part of a nomic week to publish a report - so my predecessor as
Ambassador, Steve, could also have commited the FtR infraction if e
didn't publish a report (which I won't check...).

Kolja A.

P.S. Having read zefram's deregistering note I understand why the
Registrar's report didn't come earlier, and am glad it came at all, in
fact. The penalty is still annoying, but playing out such weaknesses of
the rules is part of the fun, isn't it?

Hm. I guess as Speaker, I'm Registrar pro-tem, so the responsibility is mine.
I admit the Claim, since you provide the headers, and I remember seeing the
Report.

The above Payment Orders are hereby vacated.

You are right, of course. Thank you for pointing that out. 

I was going to simply make a COE on this, and I don't doubt it would

intricate timing question involved: The amendment of 1445 was
effective with the publication of the voting results, in a message by
Scott with headers

I would say that the rule change took effect at something like Fri, 24
Oct 21:45 GMT. (I'm not completely sure about the time zone
adaptations, though.)

The nominating period for ambassador ended 1997-10-24T09:37:26Z (Fri)
according to the Registrars report - I'm afraid this is before Scott's
amendment of 1445 took effect, so I still became ambassador last week
under the old 1445. Of course, the Agoran way to deal with this might
have been not to report my infraction, but in forcing the issue zefram
somehow made a point which is consistent with the general attitides e
expressed in eir deregistrating message. (And I must admit that in
principle I am in favour of such a more rigorous style of reporting
and applying penalties - unfair penalties and useless infractions
should be abolished, not ignored, just as Scott did it in P3564).

Ah, the fun (and irony) of playing a rulemaking game! If my analysis
of the timing is correct, I guess I'll just live with the penalty - at
least this won't happen again under the new 1445.

I formally dispute this interpretation. Rule 1585 was specifically 
designed to deal with that situation.

Rule 1585/1 (Power=2)
Official Duties upon Officer Change

      Whenever the holder of an Office changes, any duties which the
      Rules had imposed upon the prior holder of that Office as a
      consequence of holding that Office which have not been fulfilled
      must instead be fulfilled by the new holder of that Office, as
      soon as possible after the change of Officer occurs and in the
      same order in which the prior holder of that Office had been
      required to fulfill them.

      The former holder of the Office is absolved of performing all
      such duties, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

I hereby Call for Judgement on the following Statement :

  Rule 1585 should be interpreted such that a Player who is newly 
installed into an Office does not commit the Infraction of Failure to 
Report (insofar as that Office is subject to such duties) if e posts 
the required Report within a week of eir being installed into Office.

Relevant Rules : 1585, 1686

R&A :

Rule 1686 designates the Infraction of Failure to Report as the
"failure to post the Official Report", an action that the same Rule
requires the Officer to perform "at least once every Nomic Week". 
Thus, at the beginning of a Nomic Week, the current holder of an 
Office immediately incurs this obligation, which is only lifted when 
the report is published.

When a new Officer is installed in that same Office (assuming that 
the Officer is a different Player), that duty becomes attached to the 
new Officer; further, Rule 1585 dictates that the timing requirements 
under which that duty must be fulfilled become those of ASAP. Rule 
1585 at Power 2 takes precedence over 1686, which conflicts with it 
in attempting to impose a different timing requirement ("at least 
once a week").

It is the *holder* of an Office that is the target of the Infraction, 
not the "Office as a whole" as Kolja quaintly puts it. I would argue 
that if the obligation pertains to the Office rather than the Player, 
the Infraction should be incurred by the Office too. ;)

I ask that the Judge issue an Injunction to Annotate Rule 1585 with 
the attached Statement and list of Relevant Rules.

I haven't heard anything from that person, so here goes.

As Proposal 3561 failed due to the power of the evil forces not being
fully comprehended, I hereby Propose the same text as a new Proposal.

>>>>
PROPOSAL
Exorcise Probate

Amend Rule 1738 by replacing the text

      The Executor in Probate of an entity is the Executor of that
      entity, and empowered only to submit Transfers Orders for that
      entity.  An Executor in Probate also has the power to execute
      and vacate certain Payment Orders, as specified by the Probate
      Code.  This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which
      would specify a different Executor for an entity in Probate.

with

      The Executor in Probate of an entity is not its Executor, but
      is empowered to submit for that entity any Transfers Orders
      required by the Probate Code, with the same effect as if e
      were its Executor.  This Rule takes precedence over any other
      Rule which would prohibit Transfer Orders, if submitted in
      accordance with the Probate Code, from being effective.

      An Executor in Probate also has the power to execute and
      vacate certain Payment Orders, as specified by the Probate
      Code.

Amend Rule 1713 (Debt) by replacing both instances of "Executor" with
"Executor if any".

[#2: By Kolja A's request, clarified that entities in Probate do not
commit Persistent Indebtedness.]

I hereby register as a Player of Agora Nomic.
I hereby declare my Presence on any Proposal/Referendum and/or Election
currently up for vote.
I hereby beg anyone for VT's and an Indulgence.
I move to the Beer Hall and Rebel.
I hereby submit the following two proposals;
========================

PROPOSAL: The Repeal-O-Matic
{Title: Repeal-O-Matic}

     This Rule shall be known as the Repeal-O-Matic Rule and may be 
     referred to unambiguously in that manner.  The Repeal-O-Matic Rule 
     is a Proposing Entity, and its Executor is the Promotor.

     The Repeal-O-Matic Rule shall make from one to three proposals 
     every week.  The contents of these Proposals are determined as 
     follows.  The Promotor shall select five different Rules, at 
     random, from the current Ruleset.  E shall then pick a number of 
     these selected Rules (at least one, and not more than three, and 
     no Rule picked more than once) to be used for the Repeal-O-Matic
     Rule's Proposals.

     The Promotor shall make these selections as soon as possible after 
     the beginning of the Nomic Week.

     For each Rule picked by the Promotor, the Repeal-O-Matic Rule shall 
     submit a Proposal that consists of the following quoted text, with 
     substitutions mandated by this Rule:

          "PROPOSAL: Repeal Rule [Number]
                     This Proposal shall have an AI = [Power]
                     Rule [Number] is hereby Repealed."

     Where [Number] in the quoted text is replaced by the Rule Number of 
     the Rule picked by the Promotor, and [Power] is replaced by the 
     Power of that same Rule.

     For the purpose of the Rules governing Proposals, it shall be 
     deemed that The Repeal-O-Matic Rule has submitted its Proposal 
     concerning a given Rule immediately after the Promotor makes the
     selection of that Rule.

{Comment: A permanent floating Chromatic Repeal, granting a few extra
          perks to the Promotor.  (Note that if these Proposals become 
          Interested, a distinct possibility, the ROMR can earn stuff 
          that the Promotor, as its Executor, can disperse as e sees 
          fit.)}
========================================================
PROPOSAL: Get Rid of that Rule!
{Title: Repeals Without Objection}

     All Players are Empowered to Repeal any Rule over which this Rule 
     takes precedence, Without Objection.

     This Rule takes precedence over all other Rules.

{Comment: Yes it's dangerous, that's what's neat about it.}

PROPOSAL: Free-for-All
------------------------------------------------------------
Let the following rule be created (Title: Duty-Free Days):

     Any Speaker shall have the Right to declare Duty-Free Days if e has 
     not yet done so since e assumed the Speakership.  This Right is 
     exercised by the Speaker making an announcement in the Public Forum 
     that includes the following information:

       i) A declaration that Duty-Free Days are about to begin.
      ii) The time that these Duty-Free Days shall be initiated.
     iii) The duration that the Duty-Free Days shall be in force.

     To be a valid declaration, the time of initiation must occur 
     between 72 hours and one week after the Speaker's announcement.  In 
     addition, the duration of the Duty-Free Days shall be no less than 
     48 hours, and no more than one week.

     While Duty-Free Days are in force, all fees and/or payments that 
     the Rules require of the Players shall be suspended.  The Players 
     may only be assessed fines due to Crimes and Infractions, any other 
     activity for which the Rules require a payment may be performed by 
     the Players at no charge.  This rule takes precedence over all 
     Rules that require payments by the Players.

{Comment: This is another toy for the Speaker.  It serves two purpouses.
          1) A blatant source for political power.
          2) An emergency recovery mechanisim in case of economic
             collapse.}

Lately I have seen a number of Proposals that in my view should have been
Proto-Proposed but weren't.

I therefore state, until further notice, the following policy, for all
Proposals submitted hereafter:


For any Proposal which 
1) was not Proto-Proposed
2) does not benefit from secrecy until it is Proposed (i.e. certain
Scams, or humor)
and 3) does not _have_ to be Proposed at great speed;

if I find that it contains any error, no matter how minor, I will endeavor
either to Vote AGAINST or not to contribute to Quorum, regardless of my
support or not of the general concept of the Proposal.


In other words, if you don't want to Proto-Propose, you'ld better do a
perfect job yourself.


This differs from my policy for Protoed Proposals, for which I may ignore
minor errors that may be corrected later.

A clarification of (3): almost all of the recent Crisis fixes have not
been Protoed, presumably because they were felt to be emergencies. 
However, the Crisis had gone on for some time and there was no real need
to work at such a speed. In fact these more or less flawed un-Protoed
fixes comprise one of the main reasons why I am stating this policy.


Greetings,
rjan.
