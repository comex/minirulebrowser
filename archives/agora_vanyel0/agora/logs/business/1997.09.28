I hereby make the following CFJ, barring Andre:

Statement:

Calabresi is ineligible to serve as a Justice in the Appeal of CFJ 933.

Argument:

Rule 911 states in part:

      A Player is ineligible for selection if any of the following is
      true:

       iv) E was ineligible to Judge the CFJ that resulted in the
           matter under consideration, and this restriction does not
           prevent three eligible Players from being selected by the
           CotC for the Board.

CFJ 933 was called on Aug 4, a week before Calabresi registered to
play. Calabresi was, therefore, ineligible to Judge the CFJ, and so
satisfies the criterion of R911(iv) for being ineligible to serve
as Justice.

Andre has argued that Calabresi was later eligible to serve as a
Judge when the CFJ was re-assigned after the initial Judge defaulted.
This is true, but it no way changes the fact that Calabresi was, at
one time, ineligible to serve as Judge, and so is ineligible to serve
as Justice. R911 does not say that a Player who was never eligible
to serve as Judge is ineligible to serve as Justice.

This strikes me as extremely ridiculous - insofar as the above can
reasonably be interpreted as two TOs of 2 VTs each, satisfying one
of the named POs each, in the spirit of the Appeals Court's decision
on CFJ 940, I fail to see why there should be any difficulty in
accepting that these TOs satisfy the named POs.

I quote from the Speaker's decision in that matter :

   All that need be required is that the message be clearly identifiable
   as conveying a Payment Order, and that all of the elements of the
   Payment Order thus conveyed be determinable with reasonable
   certainty, either from being explicitly stated within that message,
   or reasonably deducible from the context in which that message was
   sent.

I see no reason why any of the above should not apply equally well to 
Transfer Orders. Please note that this is a COE.

You would prefer that I ignore the obvious and direct meaning as being
a Transfer Order for 4 VTs in favor of the less obvious, indirect
meaning as being 2 Transfer Orders for 2 VTs each?  Please.

COE denied.  Further, I transfer one Kudo from Morendil for making
such a baseless COE, to Harlequin, for being the unfortunate victim of

For one thing, that is precisely what I expect you to do - the Courts
have been working overtime to establish that implicit specifications
in the wording of Orders were to be given due consideration, and
Harlequin's request for a transfer is worded so that it was well
within your authority, given this judicial basis, to interpret it as
two successful distinct TOs. Note that Harlequin's request did not
purport to be one TO for 4 VTs, but merely requested that you note a
Transfer or Transfers for a total of 4 VTs; given that the POs this
aimed to satisfy were explicitly listed, your contention that the
'obvious and direct' intent was as a TO for an amount of 4 VTs
simply makes no sense.

For another thing, "unfortunate victim of circumstance", together
with your statement that "The Bank gratefully appreciates your
donation", strikes me as very cynical.

I'll let the Agoran community take appropriate steps, if they so
wish, to compensate for the injurious Kudo transfer above; however,
your behaviour as an Officer should be subject to formal scrutiny
and I therefore submit the following CFJ :

General Chaos committed the Crime of Wrongful COE denial.
