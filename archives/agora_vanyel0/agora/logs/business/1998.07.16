Well, I'm definitely here, and active. I just don't vote proposals 
that I don't see as being worth a whole VT (which is quite a large 
amount of currency to me, currently), which has been all the recent 
proposals. Proposals I _will_ vote for include proposals that will 
make my meager supply of VTs more useful, proposals for which I have 
been offered bribes, and proposals which contain large numbers of 
small to medium fixes. I will _not_ vote for simple bugfix proposals, 
not because I don't approve, but because it's too expensive.
