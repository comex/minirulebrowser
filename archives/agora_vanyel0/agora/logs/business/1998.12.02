It occurs to me that if a small group of players are going to be proposing
stuff regularly, (as has been the case, with Gen Chaos, Kolja and I) then
the Duty to Vote rule is going to cycle through the list of Players much
faster than was originally expected. 

In fact, it's a bit of a bug that the frequency that a player is Required
to Serve is not just a function of the number of players, but also of the
activity of the other players. The more active the other players are, the
more often an inactive player will have to propose. 

I suggest a modification: There are three statuses, for the time being I'll
call them -1, 0 and +1. -1 corresponds to being Required to Serve, 0 
corresponds to not required to serve, +1 means that you have a credit.
We continue with the rotating list, so that each week two (or maybe just
one) Players at the top of the list have their status decreased by one 
(-1 stays where it is), and are moved to the end of the list. When a 
player makes a proposal, eir status is increased by one (max +1) but e
does not move in the list.

Players whose Status is negative for two weeks continuously are guilty
of Failure to Propose, and their status is set to zero.

That way, active players who propose often will still have their turn
at the top of the list, but they won't have to do anything, because they
already have a "proposal credit".

I'll see if I can formalise this as a proto soon.

Once again, now to the Public Forum:

I hereby vote thus:
3810: FOR
 I don't know the peculiarities of the crisis, but I guess it's a
 good idea.
3811: AGAINST
 Why abolish the Office of Ambassador? I think it's still a useful
 function. Without IN a reduced salary would be in place, but
 slamming the door this loud does not seem like a good idea.
3812: 2 AGAINST
 Unnecessary addition of complexity.

I think we should always go ahead and use a-d.  In that vein, I'd like
to announce that I had my viva (oral examination) for my PhD on
Friday, and my examiners are recommending that it be accepted without
change.  I'll be graduating in May.  

I don't think it's truly sunk in yet.  

May agora-discussion be filled with much chat. 

Michael.  
PS: I'm about to go on Hold.  If anyone would like to be Registrar,
Chancellor and/or Justiciar until elections are held, please get in
touch and/or post consent in advance to the PF.  Morendil will get
them by default if no-one expresses an interest.

I would like to point out that Crito's proposal is kludgy, may have
precedence problems, may tend to reintroduce uncertainty regarding
whether Transfer Orders have been lawfully executed (especially in
sofar as there may be dispute as to whether a given Player is in fact
an Officer), creates a swiss-cheese network of exceptions to the rule
that only the Executor of an entity can execute a Transfer Order for
that entity, and does not solve the flaw in Payment Orders recently
pointed out by Andre.  My Currencies Proposal has none of these
defects.

I hereby transfer two P-Notes to the Bank for the purpose of raising
the Priority of the Proposal entited 'Currencies' by two.

I've noticed that in the last two batches I've cast the same number of votes 
FOR as AGAINST.  I wonder what kind of strategies would result if players 
were required to do so?  Or even mildly encouraged?  Something like the
following might be interesting, once voting costs something again... 

Protoproposal
'Balanced' voting

Amend the second paragraph of Rule 1442 to read:

      As soon as possible after the end of the Voting Period of a
      given batch of Proposals, the Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity a
      number of Voting Tokens equal to the voting cost for
      that batch multiplied by the absolute value of the
      difference between the number of votes FOR cast by that entity 
      on Proposals in that batch and the number of votes AGAINST cast 
      by that entity on Proposals in that batch.

Regards,
