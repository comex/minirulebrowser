Hsm... looking at the latest Herald's Report, some of the other 
Rebels ought to be uneasy. Time Agent and Sherlock don't have a
lot of Indulgences to lose. And Harlequin could be asking for 
favours...

Let's move a little closer to the edge, shall we?

H Registrar & Cartographor, please note:

If I am not there already, I move to the Beer Hall.

I Rebel.

I hereby submit the following Proposal and pay 1 P-Note to increase
its place in the queue:

Proposal - Sherlock #1.3
------------------------

Let a rule be created with the title "The Miscreant" and with the
following text:

      Let there exist the Patent Title of "Miscreant".

      If any Player has more than ten Blots, the Player with the most 
      Blots earns the Title of Miscreant.  If no Player has the most
      number of Blots, there is no Miscrean t.  The Miscreant loses
      eir Title of Miscreant if eir number of Blots drops below ten,
      if another Player gains as many Blots as em, or if another Player
      gains more Blots than em. 
 
      A Player with the Title Miscreant counts as two Players towards
      the tally needed for Rebellion.  If a Rebellion occurs in which 
      the Miscreant was a Rebel, the Title of Miscreant is revoked
      from the Miscreant.

What about rewarding trustees for their work? For example,

 amend Rule 1757 (Implementation of Probate Plans) by appending to the
 last paragraph the sentence 

As soon as possible after an entity in Probate ceases to be in Probate
the Notary shall pay out three VTs to the last trustee of that entity.

I hereby report that the following players have committed the
Infraction of Tardiness defined in R1023 because they did not
formulate and announce in the Public Forum Probate Plans for the
entities in probate for which they are (or have been) assigned as
trustees within the ASAP time frame required by R1738:

Morendil, Sherlock, Blob, Time Agent, Murphy.

This Infraction carries penalties as a Class D Crime, and I am
therefore obliged to issue the following payment orders: 

PO nr.       Payor           Payee         Amount
-------------------------------------------------
tardy1       Morendil         Bank          2 indulgences
tardy2       Sherlock         Bank          2 indulgences
tardy3       Blob             Bank          2 indulgences
tardy4       Time Agent       Bank          2 indulgences
tardy5       Murphy           Bank          2 indulgences
tardy6       Morendil         Bank          2 VTs
tardy7       Sherlock         Bank          2 VTs
tardy8       Blob             Bank          2 VTs
tardy9       Time Agent       Bank          2 VTs
tardy10      Murphy           Bank          2 VTs

I hope I'm not offending these players too much, but I simply think it
is quite silly to create rules and obligations and then quietly ignore
them. 

BTW, it seems to me that now that these infractions have been reported
the trustees have all the time in the world to finish their
duties... Maybe my upcoming trustee reward proposal will be a more
pleasant incentive to do this paperwork.
