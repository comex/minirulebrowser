I apologize that my arguments were poor.  I did not accuse him of
cheating, i only stated it was possible for him to do so.  I apologize
for accusing him of lying, that was not my intention. 

I think the method is a poor one.  I think a good  method would be
reusable for the next revolt.  If we know that is what is to be used as
random, a rebel could time the revolt on a day where the Dow is
favorable.  I also would not discount that the Dow is affected by a
strange attractor or some such that shows when filtered through 17 by
giving  you a none-random pattern.  And could someone tell me about
degrees of freedom in a result that has had all of its numbers chosen
before it was made?  I also would not discount that Michael knew
subconsciously the Dow would be such to fail the rebellion.  He could
have divined the number somehow and calculated it subconsciously;
anyone who can be Registrar, and CotC etc. might have more talents than
e is aware of.

I have cfj'd once more.  I think that the modulo should have been 16. 
Miscreants count in rebellion calculations not revolt calculations.
