In my opinion, this is a huge and unjustified leap. From the fact
that VTs are 'abstract', whatever that means, it simply doesn't follow
that the condition for possessing VTs is that the Rulekeepor is required
to record the fact that VTs are possessed by that entity. In fact, I
find it puzzling how anyone could think *that* could be a criterion for
possessing VTs. I would have thought precisely the reverse was true,
namely, that it's a condition on the Rulekeepor's being required to
record the fact that an entity possesses VTs that the entity be capable
of possessing VTs in the first place.

Both Vlad and Michael in recent Judgements have elucidated principles
of commonsense which enable us to distinguish, among entities, those
which are and those which are not, capable of possessing 'abstract'
entities like Blots, Kudos and VTs. This Judgement is inconsistent
with those prior, and in my view, excellent, Judgements.

I therefore call for the Appeal of CFJ 1062.

	Proposal
Probate and Registration

Amend Rule 1601 (Probate) by changing the paragraph that currently reads      

      An entity leaves Probate when eir Executor in Probate announces
      that Probate is completed.

into

      An entity leaves Probate when eir Executor in Probate announces
      that Probate is completed, or when that entity becomes a Player.

Amend Rule 1738 (Executors in Probate) by appending the following
text at the end of the Rule:

      A Player ends being an entity's Executor in Probate if one of 
      the following happens:

      - That entity is not anymore in Probate
      - The Player deregisters or is deregistered
      - A CFJ, alleging that the Player was that entity's Executor
        in Probate for a period of at least one month in which there
        were no disputed Payment Orders having that entity either as
        their payor as their payee, has been found true.

Furthermore, all persons that are not Players cease to be the Executor 
in Probate of any and all entities of which they are the Executor in
Probate.

[ comment: This causes the following:
  1. Non-Players can not be Executors in Probate
  2. Players can not be in Probate
  3. the 'timely manner' in which a Probate must be solved has been
     specified - one month, but only if there are no disputed Payment
     Orders naming the entity in Probate.]

CFJ 1053's Judgement of TRUE having been sustained upon Appeal, I believe
that Blob has never had an EiP other than Elde.

I argue that, similarly, Elde has never had an EiP other than Morendil.  In
my not-Notary's non-Report of October 14, I wrote (as one effect of Morendil's
deregistration):

  Morendil ceases to be Elde's Executor, and (depending on the
    interpretation of Rule 1738) may also cease to be Elde's
    Executor in Probate.

Steve later claimed (in eir Notary's Report of November 5) that Morendil did,
in fact, cease to be Elde's Executor in Probate.  I believe that CFJ 1053
contradicts this claim.

     THE AGORAN WEEKLY JOURNAL
     VOLUME 42, ISSUE 7
     Sunday edition
     November 16, 1997


Once again the formatting is changed up somewhat.  Any recommendations on
that topic?  (Old Journals are available for comparison, if you like.)


PROPOSALS
---------

11/09  Oerjan and General Chaos suggest a Declaration of Absence,
         identical to a Declaration of Presence except the declarer
         doesn't count toward Quorum.  This would distinguish between
         those who haven't reacted at all to a Proposal, and those
         whose reaction is to detract from Quorum but not bother to
         spend a VT to Vote AGAINST.

       General Chaos protoes the following:
         * No Crime is committed if the Player believed e was innocent
             at the time of action, or was unaware of action being
             required at the time of inaction.
         * Election results must be challenged within seven days.
         * Rule 1599's requirement to re-execute Payment Orders that
             have been executed-and-then-vacated should not apply to
             Payment Orders vacated by requirement of a Rule.
         * Nonrequired Currency transfers to Bank are transferred back
             unless labelled a donation.
         * Split Rule 721 (Vizier/Group Voting) into conceptual halves.
         * A Currency Recordkeepor may only report Infraction of
             Persistent Indebtedness regarding the Currency of which
             e is Recordkeepor.
         * Allow Groups to have SLCs other than Ordinances associated
             with them (to prevent such SLCs from inadvertently
             replacing Ordinances).
         * Transfer Orders may satisfy at most one Payment Order.

11/10  Proposal 3597 [Andre] Blot Amnesty Extension
         All Fugitive Blots are destroyed.

       Proposal 3598 [Morendil] Finish Amnesty
         All Fugitive Blots are destroyed; Herald vacates all due
         Rule 1473-mandated Payment Orders for Indulgences.

       Proposal 3599 [elJefe] Clarify Probate for Groups
         Prevent Group Wills from inadvertently replacing Ordinances.

       Proposal 3600 [Swann] More Interesting Proposal Mechanisms
         Non-Proposing Entities may submit Proposals via their
         Executor.

       Kolja A. protoes explicitly allowing the Ambassador to accept or
         reject a Player's second and subsequent Internomic Proposals
         in a given week.

OFFICES
-------

11/11  Elections close.

       These Offices had no Nominees, and are still held temporarily,
       and new Elections begin:

       Archivist             Vanyel (temporarily; no Nominees)
       Cartographor          Morendil (temporarily; no Nominees)

       These Offices had one Nominee each, and are filled by
       Acclamation:

       Ambassador            Kolja A.
       Assessor              General Chaos
       Chancellor            General Chaos
       Clerk of the Courts   elJefe
       Commander-in-Chief    Vlad
       Herald                Crito
       Notary                Murphy
       Registrar             Michael
       Rulekeepor            Chuck
       Wizard                General Chaos

       These Offices were contested, and Voting begins:

       Justiciar             Swann, General Chaos, Crito
       Mad Scientist         Swann, Oerjan
       Promotor              Crito, Swann
       Speaker-Elect         Steve, General Chaos, Michael, Morendil

       Morendil Nominates for Archivist and Cartographor.

       elJefe resigns as Justiciar, appointing Steve in eir place.

       General Chaos attempts to withdraw from the Speaker-Elect
         Election.

11/13  Vlad appoints Swann as Clerk of the Courts (this is presumably
         implicit resignation), donates all eir possessions to
         Morendil, and deregisters.


OTHER NEWS
----------

11/10  Harlequin comes Off Hold.
       Harlequin (on behalf of Morendil) attempts to register Morendil
         as a Player.  This is unsuccessful, either because Morendil
         is already registered (see CFJ 1070) or because Morendil's
         deregistration for Lawlessness prevents eir registration.
       Harlequin goes On Hold.

11/11  Vlad becomes a Boor for Proposal 3589.
       Morendil becomes a Boor for Proposal 3598.

       Champion's Rewards end for Steve, Andre, and Morendil.

       ChrisM deregisters due to lack of time.

       Rule 908 (Formal Apologies) is Infected by the Virus.

11/12  Kolja A. attempts to (on behalf of Elde) register Elde.  This is
         successful only if Kolja A. is Elde's Executor in Probate;
         this reviewer believes that, in fact, Elde's EiP is Morendil.

       Vir attempts to wheedle a couple of VTs out of a possible
         loophole in Rule 1717 - incorrectly referring to Proposal
         3591 in the process, but correcting the error the next day
         (as well as unsuccessfully attempting to come Off Hold).

11/15  Steve unsuccessfully attempts to terminate Probate for Swann.

       Oerjan pays a VT to each of Calabresi, Chuck, Michael, Vanyel,
         and elJefe for Voting FOR Proposal 3581 twice.  (Also one to
         Vir for trying hard; and one is promised to Vlad if e
         re-registers.)

11/16  Andre goes On Hold.

PROPOSAL: The Repeal-O-Matic II

Create a rule with the following text;
{Title: Repeal-O-Matic}

     This Rule shall be known as the Repeal-O-Matic Rule and may be 
     referred to unambiguously in that manner.  The Repeal-O-Matic Rule 
     is a Proposing Entity, and its Executor is the Promotor.

     The Repeal-O-Matic Rule shall make from one to three proposals 
     every week.  The contents of these Proposals are determined as 
     follows.  The Promotor shall select five different Rules, at 
     random, from the current Ruleset.  E shall then pick a number of 
     these selected Rules (at least one, and not more than three, and 
     no Rule picked more than once) to be used for the Repeal-O-Matic
     Rule's Proposals.

     The Promotor shall make these selections as soon as possible after 
     the beginning of the Nomic Week.

     For each Rule picked by the Promotor, the Repeal-O-Matic Rule shall 
     submit a Proposal that consists of the following quoted text, with 
     substitutions mandated by this Rule:

          "PROPOSAL: Repeal Rule [Number]
                     This Proposal shall have an AI = [Power]
                     Rule [Number] is hereby Repealed."

     Where [Number] in the quoted text is replaced by the Rule Number of 
     the Rule picked by the Promotor, and [Power] is replaced by the 
     Power of that same Rule.

     For the purpose of the Rules governing Proposals, it shall be 
     deemed that The Repeal-O-Matic Rule has submitted its Proposal 
     concerning a given Rule immediately after the Promotor makes the
     selection of that Rule.

{Comment: A permanent floating Chromatic Repeal, granting a few extra
          perks to the Promotor.  (Note that if these Proposals become 
          Interested, a distinct possibility, the ROMR can earn stuff 
          that the Promotor, as its Executor, can disperse as e sees 
          fit.)}

=====================
PROPOSAL: Power of Attorney

Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Granting Power of Attorney}

     Any Player who has been continuously registered for two or more 
     months is empowered to give another willing Player eir Power of 
     Attorney for a specified period of time.  The giving Player shall 
     be known, for this Rule, as the Grantor.  The receiving Player 
     shall be known, for this Rule, as the Holder.

     Power of Attorney is given by the Grantor posting in the Public 
     Forum, naming the Holder e is giving the Power of Attorney to, and 
     the time period for which the Power of Attorney shall given.  To be 
     effective, this post must name a time that begins within the week 
     following the posting. The Power of Attorney shall not be granted 
     unless the Holder is an active Player and consents in the Public 
     Forum before the beginning of the specified period of time.

     If the grant is effective, the Holder shall then have the Power of 
     Attorney beginning at the specified time.  This grant shall end 
     when one of the following occurs;

       i) The period specified expires.
      ii) The Grantor posts in the Public Forum that e is withdrawing 
          eir Power of Attorney.
     iii) The Grantor is deregistered, or goes On Hold.
      iv) The Holder is deregistered, or goes On Hold
       v) It has been over three months since the Grantor gave eir Power 
          of Attorney to the Holder.


Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Power of Attorney}

     In certain specified circumstances the Rules may grant one Player, 
     hereafter called the Holder, Power of Attorney for another Player, 
     hereafter called the Grantor.  Such a grant shall only occur when 
     specified by the Rules, and shall last only as long as the Rules 
     permit.

     When the Holder is granted Power of Attorney for the Grantor, that
