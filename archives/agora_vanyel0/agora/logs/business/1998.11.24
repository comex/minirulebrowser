H. Promotor Blob,

I hereby submit the following Proposal, paying 2 P-Notes to raise its
Priority to 2.

####
Proposal
Actions Without N Objections

Be it hereby resolved that R1728 be retitled "Actions Without N
Objections", and amended to read:

      Certain changes to Nomic Properties may be made Without N
      Objections, where N is an integer between one and five inclusive,
      specifying how many objections are necessary to prevent the change
      from taking place. Only those changes explicitly allowed by other
      Rules may be so made, and in order for such a change to take
      effect, the Rule allowing the change must explicitly state which
      Player or Players are authorized to make the change. If such a
      Rule does not specify a value for N between one and five, the
      value of N is one.

      In order to make a change Without N Objections, a Player
      authorized to make a given change Without N Objections must first
      post to the Public Forum eir intent to make such a change,
      unambiguously describing the change to be made. The change then
      takes place when a Player authorized to make that change Without N
      Objections (who need not be the same player who posted eir intent
      to make the change) posts to the Public Forum that that change is
      made, and the following conditions are fulfilled:

      (a) the post announcing the change is made no fewer than four days
	  after, nor more than fourteen days after, the post announcing
	  the intent to make the change;

      (b) between the two posts, fewer than N Players posted to the
	  Public Forum objecting to the change.

      This Rule defers to Rules which place further restrictions
      on the effectiveness of changes made Without Objection.

####

Ah, so.  I had misremembered that part of the Rule.

In that case, I hereby transfer one P-Note to the Bank for the purpose
of raising the priority of the Proposal 'Ten Days is Too Long' by
one.

I pay 1 P-Note to the Bank to raise the Priority of "The Treasuror" by
one.

For the sake of keeping some of Gen Chaos' older proposals in the Queue
I use my Promotor's Privilege to raise the Priority of "Evidentiary Status
of Officer Reports" by one.

Given that the number of "active" proposals in the Queue has dramatically
increased this week. I will relent to requests:

I hereby change the Batch Size for next week to 3.
