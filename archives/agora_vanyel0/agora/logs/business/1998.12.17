Comment on P3816: I vote against P3816 not because I am against the
principle of it (which I am more or less neutral on), but because
it seems to be against the spirit of the R-O-M.  Also I don't
like to give out R947 awards for something which ought to be an
amendment rather than a repeal/creation.

Based on Steve's record of P3533 (thanks, Steve), I conclude that
the amendment number recorded for R1662 in several previously
published rulesets was in error--the AN listed was 3, when in fact
it is 2.  This is corrected in the Ruleset to be distributed shortly.
