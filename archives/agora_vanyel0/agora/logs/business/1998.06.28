I am going to assume that according to the following paragraph of
R1539, there is nothing preventing me from accepting those players
who attempted to join PtP before it was actually created, are still
legitimate Contestants.

      A Player becomes a Contestant by notifying the Contestmaster and
      paying the prescribed Entry Fee to the Contest Fund.  A
      Contestant may quit a Contest at any time by so notifying the
      Contestmaster.  A Contestmaster may resign at any time by
      posting a message to that effect to the Public Forum, at which
      time e ceases to be Contestmaster.

So the Music has begun, and the Seating List is as follows:

Crito
Murphy
Kolja
Harlequin
Steve

That having been said, I hereby pass the parcel to Crito. And I 
drop the hint that the first Pause is very soon, so get passing!

The first pause in the Music was scheduled for 5:45am (GMT +1200)
which was about 15 minutes ago. Since Crito has not passed on the
parcel, the contents of the first layer (0.5 VTs) goes to me. But
as it was rather unfair of me to start the game so close to the 
first pause, I promise that I will give the 0.5 VT to the player
who holds the Parcel when the Music stops.

Stupid me. I got confused by the timezones. The Music does not begin
until tomorrow. Damn damn damn.

I'm really not doing a good job of this, am I? <sigh>
