Minor Crisis

In preparing the R-O-M selection this week, I finally noticed this was
published by Assessor Steve on May 08, 1998:

>Create a Rule with this text:

>      Upon the creation of this Rule:
>        * All Voting Tokens and P-Notes are destroyed.
>        * All obligations to transfer Currency due to Rule 1754
>            ("Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank") are cancelled.
>        * For each Player, 5 VTs, 1 P-Note, and 30 Ergs are created in
>            that Player's possession.

>      One second after this Rule is created, it repeals itself.

Interestingly, nobody else seems to have noticed this either, when looking at
the latest Accountor and P-Note reports, since nobody made a COE on them. 
Needless to say, there were severe consequences as a result of this Rule being
created.  I am about to publish a corrected Accountor and P-Note report, plus
an amended Proposal Queue (only one priority change was affected).  This
constitutes a COE on the latest of those three reports.

Please note the failed Transfer Orders that may affect you.  Unfortunately
Chancellor Michael is going to have to mint some VTs and re-issue quite a few
TOs because of my inattention.  For this I apologize profusely and hereby
transfer a Kudo FROM myself for failing to take proper cognizance of the
effects of proposal passages TO Michael as compensation for the extra work I've
caused em.  Steve, you should also note that your promised rewards for the
P-Notes paid by other Players for your "Levers" proposal were wiped out.

I hereby transfer a Kudo from Steve, for not RTFM on elementary majordomo
list management before starting experimenting, to Crito, whose messages
got mangled as a result of Steve not knowing how to approve bounced
majordomo messages properly.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

To whom it may concern,
  I can't seem to unsubscribe from the four Agora mailing lists.
Could someone do this manually?  Thanks!
