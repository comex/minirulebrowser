Oerjan is quite right.  My apologies.  I too appeal the Judgement of CFJ
1068;  in that case, f I had noticed the entire wording of Rule 1601, I
would have judged TRUE.

First, Harlequin was still Active at the time the CFJ was called, so his
current On Hold status would not save him.  Second, as I found, Antimatter
deregistered with no currencies, debtors, creditors, will or heirs. Thus
Harlequin's only duty was to announce that Antimatter's estate was out of
Probate. In the 8 weeks since being appointed Harlequin should have found
time to do so, and this is clearly a failure to act in a "timely" manner.

Harlequin did not need to pause to wait for the resolution of disputed POs.
Indeed the only dispute POs of any note during the period in question were
Morendil's indulgence POs for Illegal Injunction, and these lasted only a
week or so.

I would therefore have decided that the CFJ was TRUE, and I urge the
appeals board to do so.


The appeals decision of overturn and judge FALSE is also correct, though
for different reasons than I have given.

Regards,
-- elJefe

      Entities other than Senators cannot Vote on Senate Proposals.
      If any Entity other than a Senator has already Voted on a
      Proposal by the time it becomes a Senate Proposal, their Votes
      on that Proposal change to ABSTAIN, and cannot change
      thereafter, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, and at the
      end of the Voting Period, the cost of casting those Votes is
      transferred to them.

with this text:

      Non-Senators cannot Vote on Senate Proposals.  If a non-Senator has
      Voted on a Proposal prior to its becoming a Senate Proposal, then
      eir Votes on that Proposal are changed to ABSTAIN and cannot be
      changed thereafter, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding; and
      any delayed Transfer Orders submitted but not yet executed by eir
      Voting on that Proposal are cancelled.

[Parts Three and Four should be reviewed if Swann's Objects proto is adopted.]


Proto:  Plots (v1.4)


[Part One:  Rename Locations to Plots.  Discard Entities having
 Locations and Moving.]

Amend Rule 1706 to read:

     There is a class of Entities called Plots.  Each Plot has a unique
     name.  The Agoraverse is the set of all Plots.

     A Plot is Rule-Named if and only if it is referred to by name in
     the Rules.

     The Cartographor is authorized to change any non-Rule-Named Plot's
     name Without Objection.

Repeal Rule 1707.

Amend Rule 1708 to read:

     Two Plots may be Adjacent to each other.  No Plot is Adjacent to
     itself.

Repeal Rule 1709.

[Rule 1710 will be amended later.]

All Plots are destroyed.

One hundred Plots are created with the names "Area XY", where X and Y are
each digits ranging from 0 to 9.  "Area XY" is Adjacent to "Area MN" iff
one of the following conditions is true:
  X = M and Y-N = 1 (mod 10)
  X = M and N-Y = 1 (mod 10)
  X-M = 1 (mod 10) and Y = N
  M-X = 1 (mod 10) and Y = N
The Cartographor is unofficially encouraged to use this text (possibly
noting exceptions) as shorthand to represent these Adjacencies.


[Part Two:  Create land ownership.]

Create a Rule titled "Landowners" with this text:

     Each non-Rule-Named Plot has an Executor, known as its Owner; each
     such Plot's initial Owner is the Bank.

     Rule-Named Plots never have an Executor or Owner.

     A Plot's Owner may change that Plot's name Without Objection.

Create a Rule titled "Buying Land" with this text:

     When a Plot is sold, its Owner before the sale is known as the
     Seller, and its Owner after the sale is known as the Buyer.

     For a Plot to be sold, the Seller must inform the Cartographor of
     the identity of the Plot and the Buyer; and the Buyer must agree
     to the sale, unless the Buyer is the Bank.

     For a Plot owned by the Bank to be sold, the Buyer must pay 4 VTs to
     the Bank for the sole purpose of buying that Plot.

     When a Plot is sold to the Bank, the Cartographor shall pay out 2 VTs
     to the Seller.

Create a Rule entitled "Winning by Ownership" with this text:

     Owning at least half of all Plots is a Winning Condition known as
     a Win by Ownership.


[Part Three:  Create something to do with the Plots you own]

Create a Rule entitled "Mules" with this text:

     Mules are a Currency.  Their MUQ is 1.  Their Recordkeepor is the
     Cartographor.

     A Mule's Owner may transfer that Mule to any Plot e owns, or vice
     versa, by executing a Transfer Order accordingly.  However, no Plot
     may possess more than one Mule.

Create a Rule entitled "Energy" with this text:

     Energy is a currency.  Its MUQ is 1.  Its Recordkeepor is the
     Cartographor.

The Bank has 100 Mules and 10000 units of Energy.

Amend Rule 1677 to read:

     Upon the start of a Player's Grace Period, the Registrar shall
     pay out to that Player an award of 5 Voting Tokens, 5 P-Notes,
     5 Mules, and 20 units of Energy.

Amend Rule 1701 by removing this paragraph:

     Whenever there exists a Player who has never before possessed
     any P-Notes, the Promotor shall pay out 5 P-Notes to that Player.

Each current Player gains 5 Mules and 20 units of Energy.

Create a Rule entitled "Structures" with this text:

     Any Mule within a Plot may become a Structure (unless it is one
     already) when its Owner pays the price of that type of Structure
     to the Bank.  Unless otherwise specified, the price is 4 units of
     Energy.

     A type of Structure exists only if the Rules explicitly define it.

     The following types of Structures exist:

       * Farms
       * Houses
       * Mines
       * Churches

     A Structure ceases to be a Structure when its Owner informs the
     Cartographor that it does so, or when it is no longer within a
     Plot.  At that time, its Owner receives half the price of that
     type of Structure, rounded down.

Create a rule titled "Upkeep on Structures" with this text:

     Monthly upkeep on Structures is equal to 2 units of Energy for the
     first Structure of each type, plus 1 unit of Energy for each
     additional Structure, except as otherwise specified.

     If an Owner does not pay the upkeep on all of eir Structures
     within one week of the beginning of the month, all of eir
     Structures collapse and are destroyed.

Create a rule titled "Production from Structures" reading:

     At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall pay
     out each Structure's Production to its Owner (if its Production
     is greater than zero).  Unless otherwise specified, each Structure's
     Production is as follows:

       * Farms - 5 VT
       * Houses - 1 P-Note
       * Mines - 2 units of Energy

     Churches have no Production.  However, each Church is considered
     to be two players for the purposes of randomly allocating
     Indulgences, and any Indulgences which would be given to a Church
     are instead given to its Owner.

Create a new Rule titled "Proximity of Plots" and this text:

     A Farm's Production is increased by 0.5 VT for each House or
     Church to which it is Adjacent, and decreased by 1 VT for each
     Mine to which it is Adjacent.

     A House's Production is increased by 1 P-Note for every 2 Farms
     to which it is Adjacent.

     A Mine's Production is increased by 1 unit of Energy for every
     two Houses to which it is Adjacent, and decreased by 1 unit of
     Energy for every two Farms to which it is Adjacent.


[Part Four:  Amend the Rule defining the Cartographor and eir duties]

Amend Rule 1710 to read:

     There is an Office of Cartographor. The Cartographor recieves a 
     salary equal to 2 times the Basic Officer Salary.

     At least once each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall post a 
     Report to the Public Forum containing the following information:

       * all Plots, and which Plots are Adjacent to which others
       * the Ownership of all Plots
       * all changes in Plot Ownership since the last Report (if any)
       * the ownership and location of all Mules
       * the ownership of all units of Energy
       * all Transfer Orders and Payment Orders specifying Mules or
         units of Energy since the last Report (if any)
       * what type of Structure (if any) each Mule is
       * all cases of a Mule becoming or ceasing to be a Structure


[Part Five:  Authorship]

Harlequin, Blob, and Antimatter become Authors of each Rule created or
amended earlier in this Proposal.


[Part Six:  Clean up other references to Locations]

Amend Rule 869 by removing the following paragraph:

     When a Player registers, eir Location is the Welcoming Center.

Amend Rule 1016 to read:

     At any time, each Player shall either be On Hold or Off Hold.
     This status shall not be changed except as specified in the
     Rules.

     When a Player registers (or reregisters), e is Off Hold.

     An Off Hold Player becomes On Hold when e says so in the Public
     Forum.

     An On Hold Player becomes Off Hold when e says so in the Public
     Forum; however, any attempt to do so within 96 hours after e last
     went On Hold is ineffective.

Amend Rule 1664 by removing the text "whose Location is the Beer Hall".

Amend Rule 1367 by adding this paragraph:

     "Granting a Degree" and "awarding a Degree" are synonymous.  A
     Player who has been awarded a Degree possesses that Degree.

Repeal Rule 1711.
