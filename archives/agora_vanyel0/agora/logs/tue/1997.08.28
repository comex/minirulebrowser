======================================================================

Judgement: FALSE

Reaons and arguments:

Morendil's argument is in two parts: first he argues that the Herald
is not required to keep track of changes in Blots resulting from the
commission of Infractions; then he argues that no other Player is
required to keep track of such changes in Blots.

Let us take the second - and by far the trickier - of these arguments
first, and consider a specific example, that of the Infraction of
Failure to Report, defined in R1686. Morendil argues that the
Registrar is not required to report changes in Blots resulting from
the commission of this Infraction. There is a sense, not discussed by
Morendil, in which this is trivially true: no Rule actually requires
the Registrar to report the commission of the Infraction at all!
Strictly speaking, the Registrar has discretionary power not to report
the commission of this Infraction even if e is aware that the
Infraction has been committed. E is merely authorized to do so.

We should be wary, however, of drawing general conclusions from a
specific case such as this, for the Rules are not consistently
formulated in this respect.  So, while Tardiness (R1023) and
Dereliction of Duty (R1644) are treated like Failure to Report in that
a Player or group of Players are authorized but not required to report
the commission of the Infraction when it occurs, it could be argued
that in the case of Delayed COE Response (R1431), the Player who
posted the original Claim of Error *is* required to report the
incursion of a Blot penalty (the Rule says that the penalty is "to be
reported", which plausibly can be read as imposing a requirement to
report), and similar remarks apply to the Infraction of Excess
Proposing (R1065), and to other Infractions defined in the Rules.

Morendil's statement is, however, very general, claiming that "No
Player is currently required to report a change in Blots resulting
from the commission of an Infraction." The strategy we need then is
either to concentrate on Infractions like Delayed COE Response, or
just to assume in the case of Infractions like Failure to Report that
the Registrar does in fact report the commission of the Infraction,
and see what follows.

Well, what does follow? Regarding Delayed COE Response, we have this
statement from R1431:

      A Player who fails to post a Response within the alloted time
      commits the Infraction of Delayed COE Response, carrying a
      penalty of 1 Blot, to be reported by the Player who posted the
      Claim.

Rule 1435 states:

      A Payment Order for 1 Indulgence, the payee of which is the
      Bank, is called a Blot. When a Rule states that a Player is to
      gain some number of Blots, a Payment Order shall be executed
      with that Player as the payor, the Bank as the payee, and for a
      number of Indulgences equal to the number of Blots that Player
      is to receive. This order is to be executed by whomever is
      required to report the change in Blots.

while Rule 1504 states:

      Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their
      legal report, and the Player making the report of the Infraction
      shall execute whatever Payment Order(s) are required to apply
      the penalty specified for that Infraction.

Question: what happens if I legally report the commission of the
Infraction of Delayed COE Response by posting to the PF: "Jill has
committed the Infraction of Delayed COE Response, and gains 1 Blot."?
In particular, does this message constitute the execution of a Payment
Order for 1 Indulgence from Jill to the Bank? Given the identification
of Blots with Payment Orders for Indulgences in R1435, I think the
answer is 'yes'.

It is crucial to note that the question here is *not* whether the
simple reporting of the commission of the Infraction (without
mentioning the Blot penalty) constitutes the execution of a PO for
Indulgences. On that question, I agree with Morendil that these are
not identical. But that observation is of no use to us here, because
here we are concerned with changes in Blots. If I post the PF merely
that "Jill has committed the Infraction of Delayed COE Response.",
then I have not yet done all that R1431 requires me to do, since I am
also required to report that Jill has earned a 1 Blot penalty. This is
important because Morendil's argument relies at this point on the
claim that, in general, all that a Player who is required to report
the commission of an Infraction is required to do is report the
commission of the Infraction, and no more. But in at least one case -
Delayed COE Response - we find a counterexample to that claim. Merely
reporting the Infraction is not enough; I have to report the Blot
penalty also. In fact, even in a case like Failure to Report, where
the relevant Rule (1686) makes no specific mention of a Blot penalty,
the reference to a penalty "the same as...for a Class D crime" is
enough to ensure, via R1504, that if the Registrar does report the
commission of the Infraction, then e is required to execute a PO for
Indulgences, and hence report a change in Blots. So, after extensive
argumentation, we can see that the second part of Morendil's argument
fails.

[It's worth commenting at this point on an ambiguity in R1504: it's
not clear whether the report of the Infraction and the report of the
gain in Blots have to be made in the same message, or whether the
report of gain in Blots can follow the report of the Infraction by up
to seven days. The first sentence of R1504 states that "Penalties for
Infractions are applied immediately upon their legal report". But the
legal report of what: the penalties or the infractions? If infractions
is meant, R1504 is somewhat in tension with itself, since it
immediately goes on to imply (along with other Rules, eg R1599) that
the application of the penalty can be later than the report of the
Infraction. So I read R1504 as saying that penalties for Infractions
are applied at the time the penalty is reported, which can be later
than the time the Infraction is reported.]

Turning now to the first part of Morendil's argument, we can see much
more straightforwardly that it too fails. Morendil argues that the
Herald is not required to report changes in Blots.

The responsibilities of Recordkeepors with respect to their Currencies
are set out in Rules 1578 and 1596:

1578: The Recordkeepor of a Currency is required to maintain a record
      of the amounts of that Currency held by the various entities
      which possess units of that Currency.

1596: Each Recordkeepor shall maintain a record of all Payment Orders
      executed which specify the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor; this record shall also indicate, for each Order,
      whether that Order has been satisfied, is disputed, or has been
      vacated.

Regarding the relationship between Indulgences and Blots, the Rules
are reasonably clear. "A Payment Order for 1 Indulgence," says R1435,
"the payee of which is the Bank, is called a Blot." This seems pretty
straightforward.  Blots are outstanding Payment Orders for
Indulgences, including (not excluding, pace Morendil) disputed Payment
Orders.  Vacated Payment Orders don't count as outstanding Payment
Orders, which seems to me to be the purpose of the clarificatory
language (which is what I take it to be) in the second paragraph of
R1435.

A 'change in Blots', then, is simply a change in the number of
non-vacated outstanding Payment Orders for Indulgences which have been
assessed against a Player. Now we come to Morendil's first point: he
argues that no Rule specifically requires the Herald to keep track of
changes in the number of non-vacated outstanding Payment Orders for
Indulgences which have been assessed against a Player. (Or rather,
this is the argument he offers after one has corrected the mistake he
makes about whether disputed Payment Orders for Indulgences count as
Blots.) This claim is, strictly speaking, correct. No Rules
specifically makes such a requirement. But that is because no Rule
needs specifically to make such a requirement. Such a requirement is
already implicit in the more general requirement set out in R1596 that
the Herald maintain records of all Payment Orders for Indulgences and
their statuses, be they satisfied, disputed or vacated. In fulfilling
this requirement, the Herald will, ipso facto, be keeping track of any
change in the number of non-vacated Payment Orders for Indulgences,
and hence, in the number of Blots.

This is enough to show that the Statement is FALSE, for the argument
given above shows that Herald is required to keep track of, and hence
ultimately to Report (via R1377), changes in Blots resulting from the
commission of Infractions.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

A Recordkeepor is a Player who is required to maintain a record of
past and present Payment Orders naming a particular Currency. To
fulfill these obligations, it is necessary, and sufficient, that a
Player should be able, if called upon to do so under Rule 1064 (FOIA),
to provide upon request a list of all Payment Orders naming that
particular Currency that have been executed in the last four Weeks,
and their status.

No additional obligation is imposed upon a Recordkeepor with respect
to Payment Orders, or to any given set of Payment Orders. In
particular, a Currency Recordkeepor is not required to keep track of
"changes in the total amount of Payment Orders executed, but not
disputed or vacated", which is the long-winded expansion of the legal
shorthand "a change in Blots". A Recordkeepor is a fortiori not
required to *report* such changes, which makes Rule 1435's designation
of "whomever is required to report the change in Blots" vacuuous.

To sum up : if I were the Recordkeepor for Indulgences, no Rule could
currently _require_ me to post a message to the Public Forum whenever
a Player's Blots changed.

Are some other Players required to post reports of such changes ? This
responsibility could conceivably fall to Players required to post
Reports of Infractions. The reasoning would be : "A report of an
Infraction committed by a particular Player leads to a Blot penalty
assessed against that Player, and thus constitutes a report of a
change in Blots".

This inference, however, misses one crucial step. A "change in Blots"
is the result of a Payment Order in Indulgences being executed. But
the report of an Infraction is not, in and of itself, a Payment Order,
and thus the requirement to report an Infraction cannot simultaneously
constitute a requirement to report a change in Blots.

A solution to this problem would be to enact Implicit Payment Orders,
the mirror image of Implicit Transfer Orders, which - employed with
the same caution which was reserved to ITOs - would restore reports of
Crimes and Infractions to their full effectiveness.

I transfer one Kudo 

   from Morendil, because of the cynical way in which he has created
     extra work for the judicial system by submitting an appeal that
     doesn't really have the backing of three individuals

   to Andre, because of the contribution he has made the game in 
     making a mailing list available.

Appeals decisions

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Justice elJefe's decision: SUSTAIN

>                               CFJ 930

> "No Payment Orders have thus far been successfully executed, for the
>  reason that none exist."

Judge Chuck relied on the reasoning of CFJ 929:

> However, at the time of the CFJ, only one Transfer Order could have
> been submitted, namely the Chancellor's transfer of 9 Indulgences
> from the Bank to Elde. At that time the Mint (which was Mintor of
> Indulgences) no longer had Mint Authority due to the effects of
> Proposal 3533. Thus Indulgences ceased to exist as a Currency by
> Rule 1579, and so the Chancellor's posting, not referring to any
> Currency, was not a Transfer Order.

The only point in dispute is whether Indulgences continued to exist as
a currency after the adoption of Proposal 3533.  If they did then the
reasoning in the quoted paragraph of CFJ 929 is correct and the
judgement of TRUE stands.  If not then the judgement in both CFJs
should be FALSE, since the Misanthropists' currencies failed to
confuse itself with Payment Orders or Transfer Orders defined in the
Rules.

Quoting from Rule 1579: "If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist,
or ceases to have the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that
Currency are destroyed, and that Currency ceases to exist."  There is
unchallenged evidence that the old Mintor for Indulgences ceased to
exist, and that no new Mintor was designated.  Therefore unless this
conflicts with some higher-power Rule, it must be applied.

Rule 1435 begins "Indulgences are a Currency."  One possible
interpretation is that Indulgences were destroyed and ceased to exist
at a given instant; but then immediately after that R1435
re-established Indulgences as a Currency without a Mintor, which then
is immune to R1579 since it has no Mintor which can either cease
existing or lose Mint authority. (*)

This has several things wrong with it.  Rule 1435 is silent as to
whether Indulgences have a Mintor or not, so there is no conflict on
this point with R1579.  Thus any "re-establishment" of the currency
must follow the first sentence of R1579, which insists that each
Currency has a Mintor.

Further, the whole notion does not give sufficient respect to the
natural meaning of "cease to exist".  A rule mandating that something
ceases to exist does not mean for the thing to have its existence
interrupted temporarily and then re-appear.  If R1579 is strong enough
to destroy Indulgences (or P-notes) as a currency, then it is strong
enough to keep them destroyed.

This brings us to the central question: _is_ R1579 strong enough to do
what it says?  Well, does it conflict with R1435?  No.  R1435 simply
says that Indulgences are a Currency; R1579 says that they are in fact
a destroyed Currency. (**) This is similar to the repeal of a Rule;
longstanding Game Custom holds that a Rule or Proposal which repeals
another Rule is not for that sole reason in conflict with it. (***)
Thus 1579 did cause Indulgences to cease to exist, and they still
cease to exist to the present time.

NOTES:

(*) This possibility was raised during the discussion of the issues
surrounding a similar situation with regards to P-notes, so it is as
well to dispose of it here.

(**) My fellow learned Justice Michael objected that an earlier
version involves a "secret" insertion of "defunct" into the rule.
This wording is what I meant.

(***) My fellow learned Justice Michael also objected here, pointing
out that Rules and Rule changes occupy separate worlds.  But I feel
this misses the point of my analogy: a Rule Change (proposed or
unproposed) is effective only by virtue of Rules that allow it to take
effect.  Do those Rules (which affect the content of the Ruleset)
actually _conflict_ with the Rule being repealed?

This would be like having an implicit clause in each Rule that stated
"This rule may not be repealed"; game custom says it does not.
Similarly, Rule 1479 does not contain an implied "this currency may
not be destroyed" as part of its defining sentence.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Justice Michael's decision: OVERTURN/reverse

If Indulgences exist, then a Payment Order was executed by the
Chancellor when he attempted to transfer 9 Indulgences from the Bank
to Elde.

If Indulgences exist, then the Indulgence Currency's Recordkeepor is
authorised to record and execute Payment Orders (R1596).

Thus, if Indulgences exist, the correct judgement for this CFJ is
FALSE.

The argument that Indulgences do not exist is based on R1579, which
states that all Currencies have a Mintor and if a Currency should lose
its Mintor, then it is destroyed.  It is accepted that an entity known
as the Mint was the Mintor for Indulgences before the Pragmatic
Currencies reform occurred.

By virtue of R1586, we must also accept that the Mint no longer
exists, so it would appear that the antecedent of the conditional
sentence of the second paragraph in R1597 holds.  So, what might
prevent Indulgences from being destroyed, as required by R1579?

The answer is the precedence taking R1435.  This states that
"Indulgences are a Currency".  This statement must remain true,
whatever R1579 says to the contrary.  My Fellow Justice elJefe claims
that this is possible if one reads "Indulgences are a Currency" as
"Indulgences are a destroyed Currency".

This is a senseless contortion.  We do not need to put the rules
through such hoops.  We have rules taking precedence over each other
all the time.  When we read "Indulgences are a Currency", we know that
this is equivalent to stating that there exists a Currency whose name
is "Indulgences".  But now the opposing argument wants us to
simultaneously read this as admitting the precise opposite, that this
Currency doesn't exist at all.

I refuse to make the Rules play such tricks.  If a high precedence
rule says that Indulgences exist, then the lower precedence R1579 can
yammer on about Mintors and the lack thereof all it likes.

Indulgences exist.

Do Players with children tend to be Pragmatists, and single Players tend

This conclusion requires a perspective on the game that is nowhere
mandated by the Rules. Rule 101 is the only "meta-rule" that we
must obey, and it says only that we must obey the Rules, not that
out actions are limited to those things explicitly allowed by the
Rules. Even the idea that a Rule could potentially prevent us
from eating or breathing is laughable, as I tried to show some
time back when I proposed the suicide Proposal, which, unfortunately,
failed by a small margin.

Ahh, I hear echos of my former self here.  I lost this argument a while back. 
R101 forces us to be subject to the Rules at all times, based on the fact that
a Player is the person.  So anything the Rules say a Player must or must not do
is something the person must or must not do, and this applies continuously for
as long as that person is registered.

Of course the Rules cannot *prevent* us from eating or breathing.  However,
under the current interpretation, it is possible for the Rules to make it
*illegal* for us to do so.  Enforcement of such a rule is another issue.

The converse perspective is also not mandated by the Rules.

116 permits us, within the context of the Rules, to eat and
breathe.  Without it (and without a Game Custom to the same
effect), there would be no reason which could be derived
from the Rules alone to favor "everything not prohibited
is permitted" over "everything not permitted is prohibited"
or vice versa.  Eating and breathing would fall into a
nebulous equally-legal-and-illegal state.

In Agora, I believe Game Custom is sufficiently strong to establish
"everything not prohibited is permitted" even without 116.
The first sentence of 116, like 101, serves merely to clarify
a point which would be true even without it--perhaps for
the benefit of new players who, not having the knowledge of
Game Custom, would otherwise be uncertain of that point.

Of course. 101 forces us to obey the Rules. But nothing forces us to
obey 101. Of course, not to do so would be rather pointless, unless
larger issues were at stake.

True. However, my point was that if such a Rule existed, 116 would
provide absolutely no protection at all.
