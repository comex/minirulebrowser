I thought we *did* agree that Locations could indeed be created by proposal.

Lying is a crime in PF postings, not in a-d postings.

My experience has been that Mao is only fun when you are the dealer. :) 

(I don't know about the varieties anyone else has played, but the "Five-Card Mao" I was taught 
included a penalty of one card for saying anything other than a phrase required by the rules. 
Inevitably, every time I saw someone run it, one player would talk, get penalized, and begin 
frantically squaking at the dealer about it, getting more and more cards while everyone else 
collapsed into laughter.)
