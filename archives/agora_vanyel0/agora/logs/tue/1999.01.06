None at the moment, apparently - you did receive the one you were reacting
to, didn't you? There was some problem with the adresses - your domain name
often differs from one message to the next. I have solved the problem by
adding a bogus address gardner@cc.monash.edu.au. The mail on that address is
not received by you (or anyone else but me), but it does allow you to send
mail from gardner@xxx.cc.monash.edu.au for any value of xxx, not just the
silas-2 under which you are subscribed.

Apparently that one message did not arrive, I have unfortunately not saved
the error message, so I can't tell you what exactly went wrong, but whatever
it was, it clearly was temporary.
