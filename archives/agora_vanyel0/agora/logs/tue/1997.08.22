Is yoyo down now too?  The last message I sent has
never come back and I have not received any other
mail from yoyo since yesterday either.  Anybody
here?

I'm here. Steve was putting up some new lists, but I accidentily
deleted the post in which he announced them. Does anybody have
the new address, and does anybody know if they're up already?

Last thing I heard from Steve, they had the
Majordomo software installed and the lists
created, but didn't have things quite working yet.
Unless I missed something, e said not to subscribe
yet.  I didn't save the addresses either, since I
figured Steve would send them out again when
things were ready.

I haven't seen anything on yoyo for some time; figured it was just
quiet.
