I recently sent Judgements in these cases to nomic-business, which seems to
be having a problem.  I wanted to make it publicly because Antimatter (for
one) may wish to take action based on the arguments.  Thus I'm offering a
digest of the key point of the Judgements to the backup list.

Basically I am ruling FALSE to both, based on the conclusion that Blob and
Antimatter are not in Probate and do not have Executors in Probate.

At their deregistrations neither of these players possessed any currencies.
(due to the Pragmatic Currencies destruction).  Thus Rule 1601 did not
place them into Probate, and the Notary's attempt to assign an Executor in
Probate was ineffective.

To conclude otherwise we would have to argue that the Notary can place
someone into Probate regardless of Rule 1601, or that the Notary can assign
an EiP to someone, whether or not they're in Probate.  I don't see either
of these as consistent with the Rules.

When a Player is deregistered, e is placed in Probate regardless of
whether e has Currencies or not.  Rule 1601 is quite clear on this.
How do you maintain that these Players were not placed in Probate upon
their deregistration, then?
