It seems I'm missing more mail. Where did Morendil claim this?  And
can someone please send me Morendil's critique of my Judgement of CFJ

They shouldn't. That's why I feel the "allows us to breathe"
justification of 116 is flawed.

But, as has been pointd out, it is a useless counter-argument. The
action may be allowed, but the Player is assumed not to have the power
to exercise the action, unless the action is a real-world one that
the Player can patently perform. I would rather strengthen the
Rule to make such actions performable in some manner, but that
doesn't seem to be popular.

I am just pointing out that by making all unregulated game actions
permissible but implicitly impossible is rather confusing to new
Players. The operative system, at any rate, can be easily derived
from the rest of the Rules (specifically 101).

I think it would be infinitely more useful in a FTF game, as Suber
originally envisioned, or in a more liberal game philosophy.

Fine, they're illegal. Good luck filing a CFJ, since you have to
name a specific Rule that is being violated. There is no
penalty for doing something "illegal", whatever definition
one takes.

The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of
a VOC directive was the report published in the PF on 1996/08/13
(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

As far as I know, no Herald's Report has ever been subject to
the adoption of a VOC directive.

Then either request the Rulekeepor attach an informal annotation, make

Rule 116 takes on a different character in an environment where Player
interaction is, by nature of the media of communication, restricted
and highly regimented.  In a FTF game, there is far more opportunity
for multiple modes of Player interaction.

OFF:  New Proposal

There is one new proposal distributed as of this report.

======================================================================
D = Disinterested
d = Disowned
S = Silly
 
D  3549 G. Chaos	1 (untitled)

======================================================================

Proposal 3549 (G. Chaos) AI = 1 (Disinterested)

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1696 be amended by appending the
following paragraph:

      Whenever there exists a Player who has never before possessed
      any Voting Tokens, the Assessor shall pay out 5 Voting Tokens to
      that Player.

(There's presently no provision for getting any VTs to new Players,
and forcing them to trade a P-Note for some VTs is a bit mean.)

Of course, I missed Rule 1677/3 when I proposed that.  Oh well.

Steve, I think you're past due on reporting Calabresi's Grace Period
award of 5 VTs, per Rule 1677.

I respectfully disagree; counterexamples abound. The Mousetrap Scam was
based on creating an Organization of an unspecified class, which was not
explicitly allowed but certainly possible, thus permitted by 116. More
recently my own continuing scam of the Executor in Probate rules hinges
on a Rule's attempting to disallow some legal actions, but failing
due to a higher-precedence Rule.

Hey, congratulations !

Possibly because they were working more or less correctly. ;)

You'll have to admit that this latest reform is a smashing success
as far as making the game interesting is concerned.

Perhaps I didn't make myself clear--I don't disagree with what
the law *is*.  My analogy pertained to what the law should be,
and also to the Honorability of your legal actions.

Andre and Murphy,

As a result of the weekly Indulgence Lottery, each
of you had one delayed Transfer successfully kick
off to transfer your Indulgences back to the Bank.

Unfortunately, due to the timing specified in the
Rules for Indulgence distribution and Persistent
Indebtedness Infractions, you both were still
liable for Persistent Indebtedness on the original
POs before these transfers could occur.

Hell, I'm not depriving Elde or Blob of anything significant then,
they're currently not playing the game. We Agorans are usually less
concerned with what the law should be than with what it is. As to
'Honorability' as you so charmingly put it, I have no qualms whatsoever
in exploiting whatever loopholes I find in the Rules for the purposes
of interesting and amusing Scams. Go figure why, I even thought that
was one of the unstated goals of the game...

If you don't like the law as it *is*, though, all you have to do is
submit Proposals to make whatever changes you think are necessary.

These are forms that are in the new Information on Graduate Requirements for the
CS Dept.  You need to keep a record of what you are doing. Fill out the
forms and keep them until you are asked to hand them in.  

If you have any further questions, pl. let me know.

I put a bunch of them on the shelf near the mailboxes, pl. take one, if you 
don't already have one.

Thanks,

Mary

I was the one who raised the doubts in the first place, and my own
final position settled on this: despite my disquiet about it, I
could think of no reason why, since we unproblematically allow
Proposals to create VTs, we shouldn't also allow Proposals to create
Locations. So I'm satisfied as to the legal existence of Locations,
although I still question the wisdom of using a Proposal rather
than some other mechanism (announcement Without Objection by the
Cartographor, for instance), to create them.

I maintain, however, that the infection of R1708 destroyed Adjacencies,
and that these have not yet been reestablished, despite the disinfection
of R1708. On the other hand, I don't think that Harlequin actually
reported any Adjacencies in his Report, did he?

Oh, I don't know. I'm actually quite sympathetic to the general idea
that perhaps we should, in the name of encouraging creative play,
allow some of the actions which we currently label permissible but
impossible to be performed via posts to the Public Forum, although I
think it may be quite tricky to legislate.  What have been unpopular,
I grant you, have been your proto-proposals revising R116, which I
guess proves my point about the trickiness of legislating on the
subject. I wish I could be of more concrete help in this endeavour.

At the risk of brining this up again, let me throw out a few scenarios and
let me know what happens...

I am under the jurisdiction of rules A, B, C, and D.  People have told me
what A, B, and C say (paraphrased, nobody's quoted the rules to me).  Rules
A and B were made available to me.  I read rule A, but when the e-mail
arrived containing rule B, I deleted it, unread.  I don't know if C is
available... I've looked for it, and haven't been able to find it (I've
never actually asked anyone for it).  I have never seen D, and in fact,
don't even know it exists.  The rules do not explicitly make D available to
me, so nobody's given it to me.  Of course, I don't know this.

I simultaneously make four unrelated moves.  All of them are legal by every
rule except rule A, B, C, and D.  Rule A explicitly makes move 1 illegal.
Rule B explicity makes move 2 illegal.  Rule C explicitly makes move 3
illegal.  Rule D explicity makes move 4 illegal.

Which moves are actually legal?

I think it's quite obvious (by the rules) that move 1 is quite illegal (by
rule A) and move 4 is quite legal (by rule 1513/1), but what about 2 & 3?

Rule 2 hasn't been "read", and Rule 3 hasn't been "made available" to me.
I think, by 1513/1, that move 2 is illegal and move 3 is legal, 'cause
1513/1 specifically uses the phrase "made available" and "provided to".

At the risk of brining this up again, let me throw out a few scenarios and
let me know what happens...

I am under the jurisdiction of rules A, B, C, and D.  People have told me
what A, B, and C say (paraphrased, nobody's quoted the rules to me).  Rules
A and B were made available to me.  I read rule A, but when the e-mail
arrived containing rule B, I deleted it, unread.  I don't know if C is
available... I've looked for it, and haven't been able to find it (I've
never actually asked anyone for it).  I have never seen D, and in fact,
don't even know it exists.  The rules do not explicitly make D available to
me, so nobody's given it to me.  Of course, I don't know this.

I simultaneously make four unrelated moves.  All of them are legal by every
rule except rule A, B, C, and D.  Rule A explicitly makes move 1 illegal.
Rule B explicity makes move 2 illegal.  Rule C explicitly makes move 3
illegal.  Rule D explicity makes move 4 illegal.

Which moves are actually legal?

I think it's quite obvious (by the rules) that move 1 is quite illegal (by
rule A) and move 4 is quite legal (by rule 1513/1), but what about 2 & 3?

Rule 2 hasn't been "read", and Rule 3 hasn't been "made available" to me.
I think, by 1513/1, that move 2 is illegal and move 3 is legal, 'cause
1513/1 specifically uses the phrase "made available" and "provided to".

I agree with you concerning moves 1 and 4. By your own stipulation
Rule B was made available to you and so you certainly violated it by
performing move 2, so I agree with you there, too. The case concerning
Rule C is underdescribed. You only told us that you don't know if C is
available, that you've looked for and haven't been able to find it.
Although this might make it seem unlikely that C has been made available
to you, it is not inconsistent with that possibility. It depends on
how hard you've been looking, and where. Of course, you could fill in
these details in the story and we still might not know if Rule C had been
made available to you, because the Rules might be silent on the matter.
In that case, we'd need a determination from the Courts about that 
particular case, and we could expect that case to set some kind of
precedent for judging future cases.

Here's an example of the kind of hard case I have in mind: a Player
(let's call her Jill) might register to play without having ever seen
our Ruleset. However, Jill has played other Nomics similar to ours
(say Ackanomic or Thring), enough to have a general idea of our
procedures without having read our Rules. In a flight of whimsy,
Jill's first move is to submit 10 CFJs to the CotC on whatever
subjects. Ordinarily, this would means that she commits the Infraction
of Excess CFJing, defined in R1562/3. But it is now claimed that the
text of this Rule has not been made available to her, since Jill happened
to join in the middle of the week, and so hasn't yet received the
Rulekeepor's distribution of the SLR. But, it is objected, the text of
the Rule is available on the Web via Chuck's CRL. Is that enough to
satisfy R1513? The Courts have never ruled on that question. Certainly
one thing that the answer to that question will depend on is whether
Jill has access to the Web. If she has no Web access, Chuck's CRL is
pretty clearly not available to her. But what if she has Web access,
but only some of the time, say only on the weekends? Or only if she's
prepared to drive across town to the University to use the computers
in the PC-labs there? Would *that* count as being made available to her?
And so on and so forth.
