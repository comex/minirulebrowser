I have been formally notified that Swann possesses 2 P-Notes, 3 Indulgences,
no Irises, and no credits or debts in any of those Currencies.

According to the latest VT Report, Swann possesses 5.8 VTs, owes 4.6 VTs to
the
Bank, and is owed six Payment Orders of 0.2 VTs each by the Bank.  But the
latest VT Report cuts off at 9/13, and Swann wasn't deregistered till 9/15.

Accountor Lee, can you please confirm whether or not Swann's VT status has
changed in any way since 9/13?
