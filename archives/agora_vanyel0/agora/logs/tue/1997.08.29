Hardly. If you define illegal as "against one or more Rules",
then it is clearly not illegal. As long as we take no illegal
action, we abide by 101, which is the Rules that matters.

So 116 actually does nothing. In fact, as against your comments,
I'd have to argue that it tends to confuse new Players, who
are likely to interpret it as explicitly allowing (and implicitly
empowering) actions (such as putting another Player on hold, stealing
Currencies) that are not prohibited by the Rules (of course, the
above examples are against the Rules, but bear with me). I say
that because that is how 116 has been interpreted in the past.
But if 116 has absolutely no power on game play, as opposed to
real world activities (I realize the disctinction does not in
fact exist, but most new Players probably feel it does, and
in practice it more or less does exist), then the phrasing is
poor. How about the following revision:

Revised 116: 
   Unless prohibited by the Rules, all Players are free to perform
any real-world activities of which they are capable, without
legal sanction.

There are two general rules principles of construction which can be
used when interpreting law: the permissive model, and the proscriptive
model.  The permissive model is predominant in Western thought: that
which is not prohibited is permitted.  The proscriptive model is
exactly the opposite: that which is not permitted is prohibited.  In
American jurisprudence, the proscriptive model is used in interpreting
the Constitution as it relates to the federal government: the federal
government is constrained by the Constitution from doing anything not
specifically permitted to it by the Constitution.

Rule 116 serves to establish that Agora follows the permissive model.
I view this as Rule 116's main function.  Without Rule 116, the status
of actions not specifically permitted or prohibited by the Rules is
ambiguous.

I don't see how it's all that laughable.  A Rule could seek to
prohibit us from eating or breathing.  After all, the State of
Missouri enacted a law a few years ago which made sex illegal.  Yet, I
doubt that many Missourians gave up sex as a consequence.

It is, of course, laughable that the Rules could, by force of inherent
power, prevent us from eating or breathing.  Clearly the Rules lack
the real power to effectuate such a prohibition directly.  And I doubt
many people would voluntarily accede to such a stricture solely for
the sake of obeying the Rules.

I possibly do not disprove the pattern. With a 13-month-old son, I have found
myself leaning away from previous Platonist tendencies in recent times.
However I think I will in due time find myself aligned more on the Jurist axis
than the Pragmatist. 

But then, I don't much see what having children has to do with one's Agoran 
philosophy. ;)

Also, possibly unlike Scott, being constantly tired is a personal habit that 
predates the birth of my son.

I think it'll take some getting used to, though. And I do think the issue you
raised, of Agora's legislation not covering the notion of consequential
damages, will become a pressing one as we get used to PC - if I understand
correctly what that means. One of my reasons for thinking so is the newly
arisen possibility for the Chancellor to adversely affect the fortunes of
Players subject to nearly-Overdue Payment Orders, especially in Indulgences, by
delaying the fulfilling of the Bank's Transfer Orders. I definitely want to see 
Judicial recourse for that sort of thing.

An interesting point - does 1586's Continuity refer to exactly one amendment,
or can it cover several simultaneous amendments as well ? 

      When the Rules defining a given Nomic Entity are repealed or
      amended such that they no longer define that entity, that entity
      ceases to exist, along with any properties it may have
      possessed.

I think that it could cover several simultaneous amendments, in that it refers
to 'the Rules defining...', in the context of a higher-Power Rule stipulating
that only one Rule can be changed at a time.

However, the problem is that 1586 does not govern here, IMHO. Not, as Oerjan
states, because of its precedence, but because it states "If the Mintor of a
Currency ceases to exist", rather than, say, "If at a given time a Currency
has no Mintor". IOW, it makes the destruction of Currencies dependent on the
punctual, instantaneous event of the Mintor's destruction (its "ceasing to
exist") rather than on the ongoing existence of a Mintor.

As far as that goes, I think Blob and Elde are, in a legal sense, subscribed to 
all Public Fora, since I am. Hmmm, that's certainly *not* to say that they 
shouldn't be notified of Agora's change of venue, though.

Has someone sent them word of this yet ? If not, I could do this - I suppose in 
some way that would be fitting. ;)

> Then what is the purpose of Rule 116?

IMHO, to encourage Scams. It provides Players who wish to attempt one with a
ready counter-argument to "You can't do that, it's not allowed !" which I
suppose is a common outcry when a Scam-like action is attempted in more
conventional Games.

It also makes a definite matter of which one of two mutually incompatible
principles of law prevails (Permissibility of the Unprohibited vs. Prohibition
of the Unpermitted, as Steve succintly put it) whereas that would otherwise be
undetermined, as someone has already remarked.

I personally think the above two reasons fully explain the existence of 116,
which was present in Suber's Initial Set, as the Full Logical Ruleset
indicates- it is one of the very few Unaltered Rules remaining in the Ruleset.

Please don't mess with it. ;)

The point about 'made available' having been made, I'd like you to consider one
analysis of Rule 1513. In what I believe is a plausible construction, a Payment
Order, a Transfer Order, a Voting message are among the Nomic Entities to which
the Rules 'grant the power to require Players to perform (or not to perform)
actions'. IOW, they are legal instruments (though not Instruments).

In this construction (with which you are entitled to disagree), reading

      No Nomic Entity is permitted to require a Player to perform or
      not perform an action unless the information of which actions
      can be required of em by that Entity has been previously
      provided to that Player. Especially, no body of text is
      permitted to require Players to perform or not perform any
      actions unless said body of text has previously been made
      available to that Player.

to mean that the above must be _delivered_ to the relevant Player is very much 
dissonant with previous Game Custom that Voting messages, and in general 
instruments of which the Rules state that they have effect when 'sent' to some 
Player, have the effect of placing various obligations on the Players concerned 
as soon as they are sent, even if they are received late, or never.

Of course, even if my analysis is valid (and for the moment it is merely a
hypothesis) the Courts would be entitled, I think, to discard the construction
favored by Game Custom in favor of one more consonant with a reading of 'make
available' insisting on physical delivery. Personally, I'd rather keep the
aforementioned Custom.

> I disagree.  But I wouldn't admit a Player into a Group without first
> transmitting a copy of the Group's Ordinances to that Player. :)

Currently, as Misanthropist's Vizier, I don't have a say in who joins. Nor do
other Members for that matter.

Ordinance 4 reads :

4) At any time that the Group has fewer than four (4) members,
   any Player of Agora Nomic may become a Member of the Group by
   informing the Vizier and the Agora Registrar of eir desire so to become. No
   membership fee is required.

'Cynical' is certainly uncalled for. As I believe my lengthy rebuttal of
Steve's arguments in eir Judgement of CFJ 937 shows, I have strong reasons for
sincerely believing that this case should go to an Appeals Court. 

Also, my reasons for wanting the Judiciary to deliver a strongly reasoned,
utterly clear decision as to the standing of Indulgence POs is not unrelated
to the unusual situation that allowed me to call for an Appeal on the behalf
of three Players at one go.

On that note, I also think that you are mistaken - this Appeal _does_ have the
backing of three individuals, all of whom I, singly, legally represent. For
instance, you would not think it odd for the legal guardian of a child to sign
various papers on behalf of that person. The situation is analogous insofar as
the Rules of Agora are analogous to real-world law in that respect.

Raising the issue of a conflict of interest, or abuse of my authority as
Executor, would have been more accurate, but after all this is merely the 
continuation of a fun Scam, and I don't recall that in Scam-related crisis 
situation the CotC usually complains of overwork.

But since that's your objection, I think you will owe it to me to compensate
for that Kudo with one from yourself if Steve's Judgement is overturned, since
that would show that the 'work' I 'created' was not unnecessary.

Your rebuttal could stretch to hundreds of pages and it wouldn't make
any difference in my eyes (except that as one of the Justices I'd have
to read it I suppose :-).  You may well sincerely believe that this
case should go to Appeal, but there's no evidence that anyone else
does, and it is this that I dislike.  

The Agoran legal system is pretty well-designed, inasmuch as one
person can't usually tie things up inordinately, because they need the
support of at least two others to call for Appeal.

I don't see that the putatively undecided state of Indulgence POs has
anything to do with Executors in Probate, except that the same
proposal brought them about.

Yes, yes.  I am aware of the legal niceties; the appeal has been
distributed after all.  I used the Kudo transfer to express a
meta-game disapproval of the action; not a claim that it was illegal.

In my opinion, you are unnecessarily prolonging the question of
Indulgence POs. [1] There have been numerous CFJs on this question
now, and none of them have been supportive of your case.  Yet still
you persist.  I will do what the rules require of me, but I believe
myself entitled to grumble a little.

I don't see it.  Whatever the end result, the means by which you
achieved it were not honourable in my opinion.  

Michael.
 
[1] Of course, you could do this by simply making new CFJs each week,
    thereby never letting POs become undisputed.  This is a flaw in
    the system, but it has nothing to do with the status of Indulgence
    Payment Orders.

I knew it was pending but I guess I got it muddled up in my mind with
the fact that the rule for Judges is ineffective thanks to the Virus.
However, Justices are subject to a different rule, so the above has to
happen.

1. RECENT EVENTS
=======================================================================

New Proposals -- Date: Mon, 18 Aug 1997 10:24:40 -0400
------------------------------------------------------

> D  3544 Morendil        1 (untitled)
Style: -1

The language is completely opaque, and this Proposal makes no attempt
to change that.

*** Morendil is awarded the Patent Title of Boor

> D  3545 Morendil        1 (untitled)
Style: -1

If you have to say it twice for it to be understood, you should have
said it a different way in the first place.  I.e., if you need to add
a clarification, you should throw away the original text and use the
clarification instead.

> D  3546 Morendil        1 (untitled)
Style: -2

Appears to contradict the purpose of Pragmatic Currencies -- by making
certain actions affect Currencies without an excplicit statement --
and it's worded really messily.

> D  3547 Murphy          1 Clarify R880
Style: no change

Trivial.

New Proposals -- Date: Tue, 26 Aug 1997 22:10:05 -0400
------------------------------------------------------

> S  3548 Steve   2 A WIN BY INSANITY
Style: no change

I'm reserving judgment on this Proposal, as I don't know what Steve has
planned for this.  I note the curious use of a first person pronoun in
the Proposal; to whom does this refer?  It would naturally appear to be
the Proposal itself, but we have no precedent that I am aware of.

Michael, might you select me to take over judicial duties, could you then
please send me an overview of all CFJs at that moment in the judicial process
with their status etcetera?

I claim that the latest Registrar's Report is in error.  It does not list
Macross as a Boor, but AFAIK the Title has not been revoked from em.

The Registrar may also wish to wave a spellchecker over the Report.

"Rule 1513 should be interpreted such that, if a body of text has been
 read by a Player, then it shall not lack the power to require that
 Player to perform or not perform an action solely because the Rules
 fail to require that it be made available to that Player."

(Caller's) Arguments:

Rule 1513 ends with this text:

     Especially, no body of text is permitted to require Players to
     perform or not perform any actions unless said body of text has
     previously been made available to that Player.

This says "Text T can bind Player P only if P has read T"; it does not
say "Text T can bind Player P only if the Rules require that P can
receive a copy of T".

Again, I will accept this (and other statements of its kind) as an implicitly
delayed Transfer Order meant to satisfy the PO referred to in the message.

Murphy,

I would like to point out, in case you haven't noticed, that you actually have
another PO, issued earlier for 2 Indulgences, as the result of a Failure to

Hi all,

I'm sorry for my long and unexplained absence - I've been away on a
physics summer school. Unfortunately this business of declaring
players away on holidays as absent had me so scared (no, not really, I
just wanted to take the "risk" into account playfully) that I sent my
message with the move to the stasis chamber privately to harlequin
just when e was having problems with eir mailer, so I guess it never
reached em.

Just a few catching-up-remarks:

- thanks to Steve for registering me with the new mailing lists, it
was good not to miss too much. I've also subscribed to the backup
now. 

- concerning Andre's proto on a viral antidote: what is the point of
having a virus if it never does anything really relevant and is
limited only to attacking more or less marginal rules? I'd say that it
would only be a lot of paperwork. I found the infections of the last
few weeks quite entertaining, especially when more "essential" rules
were concerned. So I guess I'd vote aginst such a proposal.

- isn't this EiP stuff fun? Well, if it wasn't my CFJ that happened to
be judged by my "opponent" in the matter, I'd have been kinda ROTFL
when it effectively was assigned to Morendil. BTW, not that I really
want to, but could I still appeal that judgement? I did not find a
time limit for appeals in a quick look through the relevant rules.

- another thing that happened some time ago, but still the relevant
post was by far the most unpleasant I've read here so far:

Scott wrote:
>>
Secondly, I believe it is improper, even if not illegal, to prosecute
or convict someone for a crime when e acted on informed belief of the
correctness of eir actions.  Thus, any prosecution will be met with
appropriate Kudo transfers.  
<<

What is going on here? Critos remarks were factually correct, and I
cannot see what was improper or illegal about them. However, the
threat of Kudo transfers in case of a (legal) prosecution had a very
bullying kind of a sound for me. If the holder of an office doesn't
like the risks connected with holding that office, e should resign, or
propose rule changes that remove these risks. Just sweeping them under
the rug by ignoring their consequences (and demanding that others do
the same) is not very elegant, IMHO.

And saying that no replacement can be found to hold that office may be
true, but I would rather interpret that as a hint that the office is
not constructed well (too much work (*), or too risky), and should be
improved upon. I think it is a rather strong use (or abuse) of a
powerful position to demand formally illegal privileges to go along
with it.

[(*) An obvious exception to this are offices like the archivist
connected with loads of technical difficulties in the transition from
one officer to another; but I would also strongly resent Vanyel
demanding special privileges based on a threat to step back, only.]

So (not all that humbly, but wondering what will result from barking
at one of the "big guys" :) - H. Herald take note -

 I hereby transfer 1 Kudo from Scott, for the reasons mentioned above,
 to Michael, who made the EiP-convolutions even more convoluted by eir
 choice of Elde as Blob's executor.

 I also transfer 1 Kudo from myself to Crito for noticing and bringing
 the point up in the first place, in an act of courageous defiance
 against them that wield great power in this game.

(I was thinking to make the latter transfer FROM Antimatter, because I
didn't like eir nullification of a previous, and IMNSHO quite
jusitified Kudo transfer from Scott, but as Antimatter did not
victimize someone else, well, it just didn't look like good playing
style, either).

'Nuff for now - Kolja A.

P.S. Sorry for sending this to the backup list - an agora-business
list doesn't seem to exist yet (at least I got an error message when I
tried to subscribe), and this is neither "official" nor purely
"discussion", because of the Kudo transfers.

That's a pretty big if.  If I define legal as "permitted by one or more
Rules", then such actions are illegal.

Bleah.  That takes away any possiblity of discouraging
certain actions without making them illegal.

I would think it odd if a person claimed e should get 5 votes
in (Real-World) elections because e was the parent of 4
minor children.  I think this is a better analogy.

Before I go on, i should let everyone know I'm here :)

Hi.  I'm here.

I'm going to slowly work my way in to the discussion, and then when I feel
I have at least a small grasp on what's going on, I'll register :)  I will
go by the player name of Vir when I register.

If I'm out of line in any way, please slap me around a bit.

This seems to be interpreted quite clearly to me to mean "Text T can bind
Player P only if T is available to P." or "Text T can bind Player P only if
the Rules allow P access to T."

Or that a trustee in bankruptcy should be able to vote on behalf of
