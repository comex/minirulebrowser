======================================================================

Judgement; to dismiss the CFJ

Reasons and arguments:

First of all, I should point out that I stand to gain 5 P-Notes if
this CFJ is judged true. Although I am not sure what use they may be,
this may be construed as a reason for me to judge TRUE. I will note
that Rule 1701 seems to require the Promotor to pay me 5 P-Notes
regardless of whether or not they exist. If this judgment is
overturned on appeal, as I expect it to be, I would suggest he contact
me privately to ask my price not to call him on that :-).

   Anyhow, as I was reading the relevant Rules I was all prepared to
judge FALSE for the reasons Michael gave, namely that 1579 quite
clearly seems to require the destruction of all P-Notes, as well as
the Currency itself, in the absence of a Mintor specifically mentioned
by the Rules (no nameless Mintors, sorry). That is, until I went
looking for other relevant Rules.

   What does it mean for a Currency to be destroyed? I was quite
prepared to accept a commonsense definition until I noticed Rule 1467
gives Rule-mandated procedures precedence. The procedure for the
destruction of P-Notes as a Currency is given in Rule 1722:

--------------------------------------------------------------
        A Currency is destroyed when the Mintor of that Currency posts
      in the Public Forum stating that e is doing so, unless this
      destruction would be prohibited by the Rules.

      The Mintor of a Currency may not destroy that Currency if that
      Currency exists by virtue of being required to exist by the
      Rules.
---------------------------------------------------------------


  This definition is interesting. It clearly refers to the context at
hand, but note that it requires the participation of the Mintor to
destroy any Currency. The Currency termed P-Notes will only be
destroyed when their Mintor announces they are. Since there is no
Mintor, we will be waiting a while. Until then, by default they
continue to exist.

   What about individual instances of P-Notes? The procedure for
destroying them is given in Rule 1471:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
        Units of Currency are destroyed when any entity which
      possesses units of that Currency transmits to the Recordkeepor
      of that Currency a notice that e is destroying units of that
      Currency, specifying the number of units that e is destroying.
      An entity cannot destroy more units of a Currency than e
      possesses, however.  The units destroyed are removed from the
      possession of the entity performing the destruction.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

   Although Rule 1579 clearly requires the destruction of all extant
P-Notes, none are actually destroyed until the owners inform their
Recordkeeper. (Who is he, by the way?) Until then, I assume that they
exist normally, may be traded, etc. It is not completely clear to me
whether or not the owners are guilty of breaking the Rules, but I
would guess so. I note that this gives the Wizard the power to
penalize his enemies by giving them Style Points (see Rule 1705).

  What, then, is the correct judgment? Unfortunately, there is not a
single statement, but an amalgam of clauses. According to my analysis,
the first two are FALSE, the last TRUE, and I am unable to determine
to which I should give priority. I must conclude that at least one of
the criteria (i, ii, or vi) listed in Rule 1565 for dismissing a CFJ
applies, and I therefore do so. It also takes the heat off me, and
puts it on somebody else.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

As I have noted in a previous post, the wording of R1579 indicates
that it applies to the single instant at which a Mintor or Mint
authority ceases to exist.  Since R1701 continues in effect after that
instant in time, it re-establishes a Currency called P-Notes that does
not have a Mintor and is then not subject to R1579 since it defines a
new Currency (albeit with the same name as an old one) for which a
Mintor has never ceased to exist.

As a relative neophyte in Agora, I'm not sure how such a judgement should be
regarded wrt game custom.  If we take Vlad's reasoning as correct, then P-Notes
and Indulgences (by the same reasoning) individually and collectively continued
to exist as Currencies even after the PC proposal.  However, since eir
judgement was for dismissal of the CFJ, does this settle the status of P-Notes
and Indulgences (assuming the decision stands), or do we need to re-issue
another CFJ (or multiple ones) that can be ruled TRUE or FALSE?  If this
decision is not appealed, should I interpret that as a consensus that P-Note
and Indulgence holdings should be restored to their pre-PC status (plus
whatever legal transactions have occurred since)?

On the contrary: you need to spell it out very carefully. For now
consider the action of "stealing 5 VTs from Morendil". You have 
seemed close to claiming that because VTs are abstract, one should
expect to be able to steal them by posting that you are doing so
to the PF. I say that we have no more reason to expect that you
can do this than to expect that you can climb Mt. Everest by posting
to the PF. 

What we can do in the case of stealing VTs, which we cannot do in
the case of climbing Mt. Everest, is write Rules which do make it
possible to steal 5 VTs from Morendil by posting to the PF. But
perhaps a better way to describe this is to say that we can write
Rules which make certain acts of posting to the PF symbolic of
stealing VTs, and with the effects we would exoect this symbolic
action to have (ie, the transfer of VTs from Morendil to yourself).

You, Vlad, *are* Scott de Brestian, by another name. Cf R869:
"A Player is any person who is registered as a Player". Vlad
cannot do anything that Scott De Brestian cannot.

FWIW, in the U.S. at least, modern legal practice nearly always requires
some sort of culpable state of mind*. I believe that many scholars even
take it to be the defining element of a criminal offense, ie criminal
penalties *require* a state of mind, while civil penalties may include a
state of mind.

OTOH, it doesn't look to me like Agora has a very robust notion of a civil
offense, so the distinction doesn't look very promising.

*AFAIK the non-state-of-mind criminal offenses all date from the New Deal
Era when the Federal Gov't when on a legislative spree, and the Supreme
Court hasn't yet gotten around to overturning itself on some of the more
obscure and rarely prosecuted crimes.

Kudo transfers are not threats.  Scott, however, is a Threat (or part of one).

Such a view is inconsistent with game custom concerning the proper
interpretation of R869 and R1432. Vlad is not a make-believe entity.
Vlad is you, the person also known as Scott de Brestian. Thus, Vlad
does not have wings, or three eyes (unless Scott de Brestian does :).

The view you describe above, that Players are Nomic Entities with no
inherent properties apart from what the Rules describe, was debated
at length a few months ago at which time it was called the 'avatar
theory'. It was rejected by a large majority of Players in favor of
the currently accepted view, that being a Player is a Nomic Property
of persons.

Yes, and I strongly suspect that I had the doctrine of mens rea in
mind when I wrote the rule against misappropriation.

Not really.  You could apprehend Infractions as similar to civil
offenses, but they're really much closer to administrative
forfeitures.

See, for example, CATLETT v. UNITED STATES. 471 U.S. 1074 (1985).  The
Supreme Court denied certiorari on a case involving a group of hunters
convicted under a strict liability statute (the Migratory Bird Act),
allowing a conviction for hunting doves in a baited field to stand
even though the defendants claim to have not been aware the field was
baited.  The record gives Justice White's dissent to the denial of
certiorari.

I should note that, as the Payment Order in question appears in your
report (admittedly, as disputed, but it's there none the less), it is
in fact the case that the Bank executed the transfers _for the
purpose_ of satisfying a Payment Order.  Even if it turns out, through
Agora's bizarre metaphysics, that there was no Payment Order, the
purpose of the transfer was still to satisfy a Payment Order.

By the way, on what basis do you list those two Payment Orders as
disputed?

One, I tend to give your opinions rather low weight.  My opinion of
your opinions took a severe beating when you were advocating for the
avatar theory.  Two, I don't have time to keep track of all the niggly
little legal theories that are running around.

David> How can you claim you made them on the *informed* belief that

My records showed that you executed a Payment Order naming the Bank
for P-Notes, and that my first attempt to execute it was adjudged,
again by you, as having failed.  With the adoption of Proposal 3543,
and my exercise of the Executor's power to create units of Currency,
it seemed clear to me that the final interfering factor had been
cleared.  I was not aware of any further substantial dispute.

Hmmm, I would suggest using the "roll 18-sided die, Morendil wins on 18,
original selection keeps it on >18" method that Michael detailed a while
ago in a similar situation (but that's just me).

Which CFJ are you referring to? If you are referring to the CFJ
that determined that if a person reregisters, then he is the 
same Player, I know that well--since I judged it! I can assure you
that I intended no such blanket equation of the two. True, Players
are attached to persons in the same way signifiers are attached to
things signified, and the existence of the former is contingent on
the existence of the latter. But I see no reason why, say, Vlad might
not be female, or even, as Blob, asexual.

I heartily disagree. I challenge you to name a single quality we both
share. It is my puppet, and although I am necessary for his existence, 
we are not identical. If that were the case, how would you explain
corporative Players, as we have had in the past?

Well, it's already been done.  Now I have a whole bunch of Payment
Orders to record, vacate, and frobnicate.

If I were to promulgate a machine-readable standard for posting
Payment Orders, would people use it?  How about if I paid them for
using it? :)

Okay, fine. I still claim Vlad might climb Mt. Everest even if I can,
but I won't press that point further. It does seem strange,
however, that you describe a hypothetical action of mine, which
has the effect of actually stealing VT's, as only symbolically
stealing VT's. If I am not stealing VT's, then who is, and why do
we presume he/she/it has the power when I don't?

Fair enough.

On the basis that their legal status is subject to the outcome of a pending CFJ
(R1733).

I guess I'm still getting used to the PC system, but I thought I was the only
one who had to worry about recording these particular POs.  I have already
vacated them.

Both statutory and case law are quite clear that there is no
distinction of identity between a Player and that Player's
presentation in Agora.  The situation you describe above is a conceit
on your part and has no grounding in fact or law.

Players who cannot be identified with a single person are strictly
illegal under present law.

Hm, I guess you're right.  As Chancellor I have to watch Payment
Orders generally pretty closely since, in practice, most of them

I don't know if there are any CFJ's that actually define this position, but it
is certainly the predominate view of the current participants.  I recently
advocated a much weaker version of of the so-called avatar, claiming that
"David Albertz playing as Crito" was an abstraction that came into existence
automatically when I registered, even though the Rules make no official
recognition of this.  This was not well received and apparently I now suffer
from the disadvantage of having Scott consider me an intellectual inferior
whose opinions are not to be taken seriously (I hope I won't loose too much

to have any physical properties or to be capable of having any physical
properties actually assigned to it.  It *would* be possible for the Rules to be
written in a way that makes use of it in assiging to it *symbolic* properties
such as you describe.

There was apparently a CFJ, which Scott keeps citing, which established
quite clearly that there is no distinction between a person acting as a
player and that person not acting as a player. I think.

Unfortunately, that is not the way Agora works. You are welcome to argue
that it _should_ work that way, and draft proposals to change it, but as
it stands, assigning properties to a player is the same as assigning them
to the person 'behind' the player.

Originally it was CFJ 930, but that did not really clarify the status of
P-Notes, so I issued another CFJ, 935 I think, which tried to establish their
status.  Unfortunately Vlad just returned a dismissal on that CFJ today, so I
am still unclear about the status of P-Notes and the legality of those POs
issued before Harlequin's fix.

True.  That's why I tried to vacate them as quickly as possible.  If you had
already satisfied them, I would have used the alternate method of
redistribution.

So, therefore, it would be correct to state that those Payment Orders

I'm not aware of any such CFJ.  But there are many things I'm not
aware of.  In any case, the strongest argument against the "avatar"
theory is Rule 869: a Player _is_ any person who is registered as a
Player.  Players are persons.  Not puppets, or avatars, or anything
else.

Now, "person" itself is undefined in the statute.  The case law holds
that "person" in R.869 means "natural person", but that was expressed
in dictum as part of an opinion in a case regarding an attempt to
register an entity named "person".  This opinion should not, IMO, be
taken as wholly barring the registration of fictitious persons.  In my
opinion, the question of the registrability of fictitious persons
deserves to be adjudicated without regard to this precedent, should it
ever arise again.

I don't argue that Agora *should* work one way or the other.  I agree that the
Rules, as written, define the term "Player" to be directly equivalent to the
person, not to the player abstraction.  So any reference in the Rules to Player
is a reference to the physical person.  However, IMO, this does not mean that
the player abstraction does not exist, it just means the Rules make no use of

As of this moment they are technically not in dispute (although they may not
exist).  However, if the CFJ dismissal is appealed, then I would consider them
in dispute again.  Note that at the time of the report, they *were* in dispute.

It's arguable that the abstraction in which players are fleas on the
back of a giant turtle exists.  So what?

To the extent which the rules define what does and does not exist in
Agora, the player abstraction does not exist in Agora. To the extent that
they _don't_ define what exists in Agora, it's arguable but irrelevant.

I must say, I am really sick of the condescending tone of your arguments,
however I'm not going to bother with another Kudo transfer.

The abstraction in which players are fleas has no basis in reality.  The player
abstraction I am talking about *does* have a basis in reality because I *am*
playing the game as Crito.  What we do with that abstraction is a matter of
taste.  The "So what?" is its relevance to the discussion that Vlad has
embarked upon.

I'm not sure we *can* explain them. The legal foundations of Xanadu's
registration were always pretty shaky. I expect that the avatar view
and the person view of Players are contradictory; I think we've adopted
elements of both in the past, which means our past practices have been
somewhat inconsistent (which should come as no surprise to anyone).
We seem to have settled, at least for now, on the person view of Players.

Looks like we need to re-register, then.  :-)

(Much as we'd like to, we're all too busy with other things at the moment
to spend any time on Agora.  Unfortunate, but true)

Xanadu
