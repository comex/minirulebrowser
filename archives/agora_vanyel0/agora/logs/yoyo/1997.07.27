I didn't say a Nomic Entity. I said an Entity with Nomic Properties. I'm 
actually paying attention to all this silly stuff, see ? :)

Would you kindly point out to me which Rule states that when a Player is
deregistered as a consequence of being Abandoning e ceses to be a Player ? I
see none. Rule 1043 specifies that a Player ceases to be a Player upon sending
a deregistration message to the PF, that I'll grant - but such is not the
situation.

Elde did definitely not send such a message, and 1042 says nothing about an
Abandoning Player ceasing to be a Player. I therefore stand by the contention
that Elde is still a Player, albeit a deregistered, Abandoning one.

Piffle. A number of people - weren't you among them - championed the notion
that "destruction" of an Entity that is not a Nomic Entity actually means the
stripping from it of all its Nomic Properties.

Rule 1478, in part:

      Except when the Rules stipulate otherwise, a Player is eir own
      Executor.  Any other entity has an Executor only when the Rules
      specify either a Player or a means to designate a Player to be
      the Executor of that entity.

If Elde reregisters, e becomes a Player and (if e is still in Probate) ceases
to be a non-Player.  This seems ambiguous.

>So : do I get to Vote for Elde ? Or do other such fun things ? Hey, just to

I say no.  Rule 1738, in part:

      The Executor in Probate of an entity is the Executor of that
      entity, and empowered only to submit Transfers Orders for that
      entity.  An Executor in Probate also has the power to execute
      and vacate certain Payment Orders, as specified by the Probate
      Code.  This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which
      would specify a different Executor for an entity in Probate.

Sure, but the Probate Code has myself as Elde's Executor even if e does become 
a Player again, which should be enough to satisfy Rule's 1478 conflict-avoiding 
provision.

Yeah, but if that conflicts with 1478 - and this time there _is_ a conflict, 
since 1478 says that the Executor is allowed to act as e wishes on behalf of 
the party of which e is the Executor, and 1738 attempts to restrict that - then 
1738 loses.

Ouch. What do we do now - pass the hat around, find a volunteer to host the
lists... I am currently in a position where I could have mailing lists hosted
at best.com, but this may not be ideal for the Nomic lists since I can offer
no guarantee as to how long the account I have access to there will remain
around.

Oh, right, well spotted - I hadn't seen that one. Hmm, my first guess was that
1478 does specify a different Executor, but then again maybe it doesn't - it
avoids conflicts on that score by qualifying its provision that a Player is
its own Executor with "unless the Rules specify another one", which I guess
1738 does.
