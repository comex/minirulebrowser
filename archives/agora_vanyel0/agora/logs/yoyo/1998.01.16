Hi all,

tha last 24 hours :( :( - if you have sent any votes I am to collect
please remail copies of them to me personally.

  Hello all!
   I'm sending this message as an "official" request for membership on
Agora Nomic.  I haven't played Nomic in several years, but I'm eager
to try playing again.  I'd like to be known as "Sherlock".  Thanks for
your time!
