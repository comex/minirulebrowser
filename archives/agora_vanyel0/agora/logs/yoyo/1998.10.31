CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1108 [Kolja A.]
         10/21  Assigned to Morendil, who Judges TRUE
         "The requirement to 'execute a Payment Order for 0 VTs' can be
          fulfilled by doing nothing."


OFFICES
-------

10/17  Notary Election:  Nominees are Murphy and Kolja A.  Voting begins.

       Speaker-Elect Election:  No Nominees.  New Election begins.

10/18  Registrar Election:  Murphy announces the result of the Election e
         initiated while Speaker, namely that Michael won it.  Whether
         effective or not, this announcement is probably moot, since Speaker
         Morendil has already initiated a new Election.


PROBATE
-------

10/22  Murphy submits a plan for Swann.
