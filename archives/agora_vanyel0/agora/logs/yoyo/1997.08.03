OFF: Propotor's Report

It seems I owe a report about P-Note holdings this week.  Even though I have
not yet received the information Package from the previous Promotor, it seems
clear that no one, including the Bank, has any P-Notes and that this situation
has not changed since the PC proposal took effect.

We certainly haven't moved yet. The potential site looks a promising
avenue, but Geoff and I will have to track down a copy of the Majordomo
source and install it on the machine, which I don't think will be 
happening much before Tuesday at the earliest. Messages have been
fairly scarce the last few days, I think. Unless yoyo is saving up
another 50 messages for me before dumping them on me in a huge glomp
on Monday morning, again.

On the mystery of the 2-month-old messages, Geoff hypothesizes that
some machine intermediate on the path between the origin of the messages
and yoyo suffered some kind of crash and failed to clean up after itself
properly, and this might have resulted in my receiving them. Why they
came only to me remains a mystery though.

I am forced to deny this transfer on the grounds that I cannot find
any evidence for the existence of "the Frankenstein Monster".  (As
Chancellor, I have previously reported that I believe that there are
no Frankenstein Monsters, a claim that has not been challenged.)  As
such, this Transfer Order fails to clearly specify exactly one
destination entity, and is thus unexecutable.

COE: I believe this should be the Bank, not the Mint.

BTW, with regard to Voting Tokens, has anyone considered the effect of the
(infinitesimal) period of time when they did not have a Mintor

(Between the repeal of the Mint and Treasuries, and the Amendment to make
the Bank the Mintor of VTs.)

Greetings,
Ørjan.

I should note that Rule 1741's self-repeal condition has been met,
however.

Why VTs?

I sent out a FLR and SLR several hours ago which I haven't seen
yet.  Does yoyo have some size limitation?  (Maybe it's
just as well, as I forgot that 1741 had repealed itself.)
I know yoyo isn't exactly the best at handling mail, but
most of my other posts today have shown up pretty quickly.
