I suggest a more moderate reaction might be fruitful. Certainly it
is true that, *in general*, it's silly to think that one can perform
any action at all merely by posting that one is performing it. The
kinds of actions I'm thinking of here are things like flying, or
climbing Mt. Everest. It certainly would be inane and silly to think
that one could perform actions such as those by posting to the PF.

But let's consider some other kinds of actions, for example, placing
another Player On Hold. Is it inane and silly to even consider the
idea that you could place another Player On Hold by posting to the
PF? I don't think so. There are certainly good reasons of game design
to prevent it, and that's what we've done, but it's not idiotic to
wonder what a game that allowed it would be like. The possibility makes
conceptual sense in a way that wondering what a game would be like
that claimed to allow its players to fly (I mean really fly, not
merely take actions symbolic of flying) by posting to the PF does not.

This is perhaps where the concept of a Nomic Property can be useful:
we might be able to use it to distinguish the properties it makes
conceptual sense to think of as being changeable by posting to the PF,
from those for which such musings make no sense.

I disagree that we are dealing with abstract entities not subject
to natural law, and I disagree that any games allow actions that
in real life would be impossibilities. What occurs in such games
as you are presumably thinking of here is that certain ordinary
actions such as saying words, making physical movements, rearranging
game tokens on a board, etc, are taken to be symbolic of actions
which in real life are impossible, such as travelling through
hyperspace or casting spells.

I'm all for encouraging creativity and experimentation. But I
don't think you need to be metaphysically confused to do it.

I would favor the position that, in the absence of regulation, you can
post that you are putting someone else on hold, and the Registrar (as
the mandatory recorder of who is and is not on hold) is free to choose
whether your post has any effect.  I will admit that I am undecided on
this issue.  Perhaps I would like to see a statement that Players have
general agency over themselves, and over those entities of which they
are Executors; but no Player has agency over any other Player except
as specified in the Rules.  This principle would allow a Player to
place emself on hold without specific authorization, without allowing
anyone else to do except when the Rules permit.

(I also note that I am swerving to a stance where placing oneself on
hold is properly interpreted as a request to the Registrar to note
that one is on hold; this is a request the Registrar is bound to
obey.)

Still not good enough: neither flying nor climbing Mt. Everest are
paradoxical or contrary to natural law. Yet neither can sensibly be
thought of as being achievable by posting to the Public Forum.

Blob is past due on a Payment Order for VTs.  The P/O in question
appears in the Assessor's Report of Voting Token holdings.

I have no idea if Blob is subject to penalties for Indulgence Debt;
that is not my province.

This seems a very odd assertion to me.  The fundimental property of a
nomic in my view is the changing of its own ruleset.  I see no inherent
contradiction in allowing role-playing aspects into the mix. [Picture
Grog the Fighter making a skill roll to change the Rule defining the
damage of his two-handed sword before the Red Dragon eats him.]  The
"real world" conciet is a fictional devining line, since any nomic is
"embedded in the real world" as long as there are real players following
some sort of rules.  The intrusion of any layer of fantasy between the
Players and the game is no more incompatable with the spirit of nomic than
legal deeming.

[Any new player is legally equivelant to a First Level Hobbit with 10 Hit
 Points.]

A classification I disputed, although I think Vanyel meant it admiringly.
I did ask you specifically if you intended to go On Hold and I did
warn you that if you didn't, it might be alleged that you had Abandoned.
So I took your going away without going On Hold more or less as an
invitation to make the allegation.

As for that, Derek is not around to care about his Honour, nor will
he be returning, I think.

I will read this as being 4, not 2 Payment Orders, as otherwise they
would not be according to the Rules.
I hereby submit a Transfer Order of 2VTs from myself to the Bank in

I hereby submit a Delayed Transfer Order of 2 Indulgences from myself

That's what I meant. My statement should be interpreted to read
"Many games allow actions that are representative of impossible
actions in the real world" I didn't think I needed to spell that out.

So if I type 'I become a zombie', 'I fly to Denmark' or 'I kill Vlad' on

Yes indeed.  I too much prefer the notion of these posts to the PF
being requests to the Registrar.  It is then up to the Registrar to
obey the request, and record the change.  However, if we are to
simultaneously avoid the notion of all truth being recorded in
documents, then the change must itself happen when the post to the PF
is made. 

This seems slightly odd (though perhaps there is plenty of real world
precedent): 
  in general, actions occur when posts are made to the PF, but only if
  the rules require (permit?) those messages to be the cause of
  changes to the official documents. 

Yes?  (The documencentric approach would say that the change happens
only when the document is changed, and is simpler but has error
problems, as previously discussed.)

Michael.

Actually, I have no particular desire to see you convicted of a crime nor
removed from office, but it does raise the question - are we following the
rules if we fail to prosecute actions that are clearly defined as criminal?

I see nothing in the Rules that require Players to take "state of mind" into
account for any Crimes or Infractions other than TIA.  It is certainly not
illegal to prosecute someone for illegal actions, even if e was not aware that
the action was illegal.  Certainly the Rules create no compulsion to prosecute
and create no penalties for failure to prosecute.  Maybe it's improper, by game
custom, to so prosecute.  Maybe it's improper, by R101, to fail to so
prosecute.  I would like to hear what other Players think about this.

BTW, no threats of Kudo transfers on your part will ever deter me from taking
an action that I think is right and appropriate.  This is the second time you
have threatened me with Kudo transfers and I am annoyed.

I hereby transfer 1 Kudo from Scott, for intimidation by persistent threats of
Kudo transfers, to Vanyel, who did not deserve to lose a Kudo for eir
imaginative use of Elde as a Kudo victim.

>Furthermore, both of those Payment Orders were issued by you, Crito,

Yes, but TIA is the one case where state of mind is explicitly required to be
taken into account.  My recent P-Note CFJ and the arguments I have made on the
subject are pretty clear evidence that at the time I issued those purported
POs, I believed P-Notes were a Currency and my POs were legitimate.  I don't
remember receiving any support from you for my position on this.  I don't see
how you could not have been aware of the tenuous status of P-Notes and the real
possibility that those POs would be made invalid by the impending Court
decision when you made those transfers.  How can you claim you made them on the
*informed* belief that they were correct?

D  3545 Morendil	1 (untitled)
D  3546 Morendil	1 (untitled)
D  3547 Murphy	     1 Clarify R880

======================================================================

Proposal 3544 (Morendil) (Disinterested) AI = 1

Amend Rule 1713 by replacing text which reads :

      The Executor of an entity for which, at the beginning of a given
      Nomic week, there is at least one Overdue Payment Order naming
      it as Payor commits the Infraction of Persistent Indebtedness at
      the beginning of that Week.  If an entity has more than one
      Overdue Payment Order naming it as payor, its Executor commits
      as many such Infractions are there are different Currencies
      named in all these Overdue Payment Orders.

with text reading :

      The Executor of an entity for which, at the beginning of a given
      Nomic week, there is at least one Overdue Payment Order naming
      it as Payor commits the Infraction of Persistent Indebtedness at
      the beginning of that Week, unless that Entity is currently in Probate.

      If such an entity has more than one Overdue Payment Order naming it as
      payor, its Executor commits as many such Infractions are there are
      different Currencies named in all such Overdue Payment Orders.

========================================================================

Proposal 3545 (Morendil) (Disinterested) AI = 1

Amend Rule 1437 by replacing text which reads :

      When an Player is deregistered from the game while not
      Immaculate, e becomes a Fugitive from Justice, and e receives
      Fugitive Blots equal to the number of Blots e then had.  The
      Herald shall keep a record of the number of Fugitive Blots
      attributed to each Fugitive from Justice.

with text reading :

      When an Player is deregistered from the game while not
      Immaculate, e becomes a Fugitive from Justice, and e receives
      Fugitive Blots equal to the number of Blots e then had.  The
      Herald shall keep a record of the number of Fugitive Blots
      attributed to each Fugitive from Justice. All Blots held by that
      Player previous to eir deregistration shall be erased, i.e., all Payment 
      Orders for Indulgences naming that Player as Payor shall at that time be 
      vacated.

========================================================================

Proposal 3546 (Morendil) (Disinterested) AI = 1

Enact a Rule (titled "Implicit Payment Orders") reading :

   The Rules, and only the Rules, may specify that certain actions, such as
   reporting Infractions, are also implicitly the execution of one or more
   Payment Orders, as long as the action which is implicitly the execution of a
   Payment Order is the sending of a message to the Executor of the source
   entity of the Payment Order or to the Public Forum.

[Comment : the substance of 1731; there are no Delayed Payment Orders, and it 
is not necessary to deal with cancellation as the COE Rule already permits an 
illegally submitted PO to be vacated if needed.]

Enact a Rule reading :

   The act of reporting an Infraction, and the act of submitting a Judgement 
   which finds a Player guilty of a Crime, constitute as many Implicit Payment
   Orders of the appropriate amounts of Currencies as are necessary to carry 
   out the penalties specified in the Rules.

[Comment : authorizes Players required to report Infractions to
simultaneously, and implicitly, execute POs.]

Amend rule 1435 by replacing text which reads:

      A Payment Order for 1 Indulgence, the payee of which is the
      Bank, is called a Blot.  When a Rule states that a Player is to
      gain some number of Blots, a Payment Order shall be executed
      with that Player as the payor, the Bank as the payee, and for a
      number of Indulgences equal to the number of Blots that Player
      is to receive.  This order is to be executed by whomever is
      required to report the change in Blots.

by text reading :

   When a Rule describes a penalty as an amount of Blots, this shall be
   equivalent to requiring the execution of a Payment Order for the same amount
   of Indulgences, naming the Player who is subject to that penalty as Payor 
   and the Bank as Payee.

[Comment: brings 1435 in line with the new protocol for assigning Blots.]

========================================================================

Proposal 3547 (Murphy) (Disinterested) AI = 1:  Clarify R880

Amend Rule 880 by replacing this text:

      An Officer is always permitted to resign from any Office e
      holds, provided e specifies another Player to succeed
      em, who then becomes the temporary holder of that Office.  For
      this appointment to be valid, this Player must either explicitly
      and publically consent to becoming the new holder of that Office
      within seven days of such appointment, or be the Speaker.

with this text:

      An Officer is always permitted to resign from any Office e
      holds, provided e specifies another Player to succeed
      em, who then becomes the temporary holder of that Office.  For
      this appointment to be valid, this Player must either explicitly
      and publically consent to becoming the new holder of that Office
      within seven days before or after such appointment, or be the Speaker.

    H. Herald, please note my transfer of one Kudo FROM Steve, for lack of

The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of
a VOC directive was the report published in the PF on 1996/08/13
(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

As far as I know, no Herald's Report has ever been subject to
the adoption of a VOC directive.

Perhaps impossible for me, Scott de Brestian. But why is it impossible

Why not? The second is irrelevant to the game, the last can be
defeated by the first :-). Since Vlad is an entirely make-believe
entity with no inherent properties whatever (except that of also being
a person, whatever that means). I consider game entities as being
formed by a sort of mutual definition. Its as if we were defining
a mythical animal by mutual description -- you decide it's black, I decide
it has wings, Steve decides it has three eyes, etc.

BUS: Re: OFF: Herald's Report as of 18 August 1997

There were several errors in the Herald's report.  Debt Infractions should have
been assessed against the Executors of the Players, not the Players themselves.
Also, I showed the Indulgences as already being distributed, but that must wait
for the Chancellor.  This is a Claim of Error, which I admit.  A corrected
report follows.  Hmm, and for the sake of strictly adhereing to the Rules, the
PO issued in the original report, commanding Blob to transfer one Indulgence to
the bank, is hereby vacated.

The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of

(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

As far as I know, no Herald's Report has ever been subject to
the adoption of a VOC directive.

Well, it's done regularly around here, so yes, it is following the rules.

Yes, the game custom thing.

"It's not a threat, it's a promise". Anyone who is annoyed enough to
threaten someone with a Kudo transfer is probably justified in making that
Kudo transfer (or will be deKudoed emself).

// I hereby transfer 1 Kudo from Scott, for intimidation by persistent threats of
// Kudo transfers, to Vanyel, who did not deserve to lose a Kudo for eir

I hereby transfer 1 Kudo FROM myself, for lack of a better victim (since
Crito doesn't really deserve deKudoing for this), TO Scott, to make up for
Crito's deKudoing of em.

// >Furthermore, both of those Payment Orders were issued by you, Crito,

Blech. I'll let Scott handle this one.
