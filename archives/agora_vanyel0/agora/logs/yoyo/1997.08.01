Steve,
	I'm still nominally root on yoyo, but haven't done a lot for some
time now. As far as the mail side of things go, I've been relatively
careful to stay clear of black magic :)

Next Wednesday sounds good for lunch. I'll mail you prior to organise some details.

Have fun !

Andy

The fact that R1369 defines a Thesis as a Nomic Entity which is an
essay is an unpleasant aberration that should be corrected in any
reform of the Nomic Entity concept.

'Among others' or 'among other things'.

Cf 'et al.' which is an abbreviation for 'et alia' - 'and others'.
Tongues were clucked here in the Philosophy Department recently
when a paper under discussion during a seminar was discovered to
contain a reference to a paper by Smith and Jones (or whomever)
as '(Smith et alius'), ie '(Smith and another)'. Apparently this
is Not The Done Thing.

What exciting lives philosophers lead! :-)

Couldn't resist.  I'm sure compsci's deserve as much for their own
peculiar ways...

Umm. Yes you are right.  "Nomic Property" is narrowly defined by R1011, as you

My understanding is that the Crustimony Proceedcake is to use
"First author et al." only when there are four or more authors,
and to list all the authors if there are three or fewer.

TIA. You can report things that are not Nomic Properties (for example,
players' real names, or date of joining the game), but you have to report
them truthfully.

Of course, if you _are_ an Agoraphobe, then you can report that :-)

Rule 1579 says in part "If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist, or
ceases to have the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that
Currency are destroyed, and that Currency ceases to exist."  Is Crito
saying that we can simply ignore the last part of this sentence?  Even if
someone contends that there is a precedence conflict, Rule 1579 wins over
Rule 1701.

No, I'm not saying we can simply ignore the last part of that sentence.  I'm
saying it depends on how we interpret that sentence.

1)  "If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist" refers to a specifc, single
instant of time - the moment at which the Currency ceased to have a Mintor.

2)  "If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist" refers to a continuous,
ongoing state of affairs.

If 1, then P-Notes were destroyed and ceased to exist as a Currency at the
moment the PC proposal took effect.  However, immediately after that R1701
attempts to re-establish P-Notes as a Currency but at this time without a
Mintor.  Now there is no conflict and no invocation of R1579 because the new
version of P-Notes never had a Mintor, so it never had a Mintor that ceased to
exist.

I tend to think that 1 is the correct interpretation because the sentence is of
the form "If X happens then Y happens" and X happens at a specific instant in
time.  It is *not* of the form "While X then Y".
