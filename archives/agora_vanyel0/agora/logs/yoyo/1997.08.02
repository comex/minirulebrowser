Actually, I only have to believe it - it doesn't have to be true.
But that only turns the question back onto Cartographor Harlequin:
what does he believe about Adjacencies?

Steve> Well, let's hear it anyway, Scott. 

As a Jurist, I hold that the Rules have no power to create entities.
The only way that I recognize by which an entity can be created (or
destroyed) is for some Player to be commanded to perform that creation
or destruction.  And, as we've previously noted, a Proposal has no
power to command Player action.

On the other hand, it may have been _legal_ for the Cartographer to
create those locations.

I need to mull over more the power of Proposals to change Nomic
properties.

And also the general question of what Rules can and cannot do.

"Among other things."  I see it _all the time_ in Supreme Court
opinions: "The city of Boston, its mayor, and several of its elected
officials, have applied to me for a stay of the judgment of the
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court entered October 4, 1978,
enjoining them, inter alia, from expending city funds in support of a
referendum proposal on the ballot of the November 1978 general
election."  CITY OF BOSTON v. ANDERSON, 439 U.S. 1389 (1978),
J. BRENNAN as Circuit Justice.
