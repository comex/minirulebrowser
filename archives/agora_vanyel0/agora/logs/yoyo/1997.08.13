It seems to me (says he, blithely, and not paying much attention to
what has already been said), that the whole issue would be most simply
resolved by taking the hard-line document-centred approach; and saying
that there are no Nomic Entities or Properties, but that there are
pieces of text which have Official Status.   Pieces of text can be
manipulated to our hearts' content of course, but what would become
illegal is the presentation of something that is Official when it is
not. 

Let's take the completely formalist approach, and pretend that there
is no extra-document significance to what happens to those documents
and manipulate them only according to the rules.  Let's completely
ignore the semantics of the game, stop talking about Entities and
Properties, and instead concentrate on getting everything expressed in
terms of syntax.  Once this is done, we can add abbreviations that
seem semantically helpful, but which aren't really independently
significant.

Of course, the only problem with this is that errors in the ruleset
may lead us to a situation where we it appears that we have no rules
telling us how to fix the errors.  (I say "appears" because even in
this hard-core Pragmatic world, we still retain a Platonic conception
of what the situation should be wrt those Official Documents that have
been misrepresented.)  In this situation, we might have to resort to
meta-game resolution and allow someone to Judge that the ruleset is
wrong, determine its correct state etc., and do all this in the
context of a ruleset that kind of doesn't really exist.   But hey, I'm
not so bothered by this.

Michael.

I'm afraid these Judgements are late (the appeal started at Tue 5 Aug,
~12:30 +0100), and Scott sent this at Tue 12 Aug, 9:15 -0500.  I will
be appointing a new Justice for both CFJ Appeals presently.

This is really interesting. Elde is registered and not On Hold or

Morendil who is acting as Elde's Executor, is barred. Does this mean
that Morendil cannot return Judgement? I think he can, since R1478
empowers Morendil to act "as if e were" Elde.

Morendil will be licking his chops when he gets back from his holiday.
That is, unless I have him deregistered for Abandoning first :)

I don't have the relevant dates handy, but some interesting timing
questions may appear here: Elde is at the moment very close to being

one for failing to judge, e.g., would push em over the edge. Will
Morendil be back in time to prevent this? Even zombies don't live

Appeals decisions

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Justice elJefe's decision: SUSTAIN

>                               CFJ 930

> "No Payment Orders have thus far been successfully executed, for the
>  reason that none exist."

Judge Chuck relied on the reasoning of CFJ 929:

> However, at the time of the CFJ, only one Transfer Order could have
> been submitted, namely the Chancellor's transfer of 9 Indulgences
> from the Bank to Elde. At that time the Mint (which was Mintor of
> Indulgences) no longer had Mint Authority due to the effects of
> Proposal 3533. Thus Indulgences ceased to exist as a Currency by
> Rule 1579, and so the Chancellor's posting, not referring to any
> Currency, was not a Transfer Order.

The only point in dispute is whether Indulgences continued to exist as
a currency after the adoption of Proposal 3533.  If they did then the
reasoning in the quoted paragraph of CFJ 929 is correct and the
judgement of TRUE stands.  If not then the judgement in both CFJs
should be FALSE, since the Misanthropists' currencies failed to
confuse itself with Payment Orders or Transfer Orders defined in the
Rules.

Quoting from Rule 1579: "If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist,
or ceases to have the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that
Currency are destroyed, and that Currency ceases to exist."  There is
unchallenged evidence that the old Mintor for Indulgences ceased to
exist, and that no new Mintor was designated.  Therefore unless this
conflicts with some higher-power Rule, it must be applied.

Rule 1435 begins "Indulgences are a Currency."  One possible
interpretation is that Indulgences were destroyed and ceased to exist
at a given instant; but then immediately after that R1435
re-established Indulgences as a Currency without a Mintor, which then
is immune to R1579 since it has no Mintor which can either cease
existing or lose Mint authority. (*)

This has several things wrong with it.  Rule 1435 is silent as to
whether Indulgences have a Mintor or not, so there is no conflict on
this point with R1579.  Thus any "re-establishment" of the currency
must follow the first sentence of R1579, which insists that each
Currency has a Mintor.

Further, the whole notion does not give sufficient respect to the
natural meaning of "cease to exist".  A rule mandating that something
ceases to exist does not mean for the thing to have its existence
interrupted temporarily and then re-appear.  If R1579 is strong enough
to destroy Indulgences (or P-notes) as a currency, then it is strong
enough to keep them destroyed.

This brings us to the central question: _is_ R1579 strong enough to do
what it says?  Well, does it conflict with R1435?  No.  R1435 simply
says that Indulgences are a Currency; R1579 says that they are in fact
a destroyed Currency. (**) This is similar to the repeal of a Rule;
longstanding Game Custom holds that a Rule or Proposal which repeals
another Rule is not for that sole reason in conflict with it. (***)
Thus 1579 did cause Indulgences to cease to exist, and they still
cease to exist to the present time.

NOTES:

(*) This possibility was raised during the discussion of the issues
surrounding a similar situation with regards to P-notes, so it is as
well to dispose of it here.

(**) My fellow learned Justice Michael objected that an earlier
version involves a "secret" insertion of "defunct" into the rule.
This wording is what I meant.

(***) My fellow learned Justice Michael also objected here, pointing
out that Rules and Rule changes occupy separate worlds.  But I feel
this misses the point of my analogy: a Rule Change (proposed or
unproposed) is effective only by virtue of Rules that allow it to take
effect.  Do those Rules (which affect the content of the Ruleset)
actually _conflict_ with the Rule being repealed?

This would be like having an implicit clause in each Rule that stated
"This rule may not be repealed"; game custom says it does not.
Similarly, Rule 1479 does not contain an implied "this currency may
not be destroyed" as part of its defining sentence.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Justice Michael's decision: OVERTURN/reverse

If Indulgences exist, then a Payment Order was executed by the
Chancellor when he attempted to transfer 9 Indulgences from the Bank
to Elde.

If Indulgences exist, then the Indulgence Currency's Recordkeepor is
authorised to record and execute Payment Orders (R1596).

Thus, if Indulgences exist, the correct judgement for this CFJ is
FALSE.

The argument that Indulgences do not exist is based on R1579, which
states that all Currencies have a Mintor and if a Currency should lose
its Mintor, then it is destroyed.  It is accepted that an entity known
as the Mint was the Mintor for Indulgences before the Pragmatic
Currencies reform occurred.

By virtue of R1586, we must also accept that the Mint no longer
exists, so it would appear that the antecedent of the conditional
sentence of the second paragraph in R1597 holds.  So, what might
prevent Indulgences from being destroyed, as required by R1579?

The answer is the precedence taking R1435.  This states that
"Indulgences are a Currency".  This statement must remain true,
whatever R1579 says to the contrary.  My Fellow Justice elJefe claims
that this is possible if one reads "Indulgences are a Currency" as
"Indulgences are a destroyed Currency".

This is a senseless contortion.  We do not need to put the rules
through such hoops.  We have rules taking precedence over each other
all the time.  When we read "Indulgences are a Currency", we know that
this is equivalent to stating that there exists a Currency whose name
is "Indulgences".  But now the opposing argument wants us to
simultaneously read this as admitting the precise opposite, that this
Currency doesn't exist at all.

I refuse to make the Rules play such tricks.  If a high precedence
rule says that Indulgences exist, then the lower precedence R1579 can
yammer on about Mintors and the lack thereof all it likes.

Indulgences exist.

Appeal decisions

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Justice Murphy's decision: to OVERTURN and reverse decision

I agree with Judge elJefe that the Caller's argument is incorrect.

Rule 1435 ("Indulgences exist") takes precedence over Rule 1579 ("all
Currencies must have a Mintor; any Currency ceasing to have one is
destroyed").  Even accepting CFJ 929's claim that Indulgences were
destroyed (which seems to be a conflict between those rules),
Indulgences are then resurrected with no Mintor.

I therefore consider the Statement false for lack of evidence.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Justice Michael's decision: to OVERTURN and reverse decision

Reasons and arguments:

If Indulgences exist, then a Payment Order was executed by the
Chancellor when he attempted to transfer 9 Indulgences from the Bank
to Elde.

If Indulgences exist, then the Indulgence Currency's Recordkeepor is
authorised to record and execute Payment Orders (R1596).

Thus, if Indulgences exist, the correct judgement for this CFJ is
FALSE.

The argument that Indulgences do not exist is based on R1579, which
states that all Currencies have a Mintor and if a Currency should lose
its Mintor, then it is destroyed.  It is accepted that an entity known
as the Mint was the Mintor for Indulgences before the Pragmatic
Currencies reform occurred.

By virtue of R1586, we must also accept that the Mint no longer
exists, so it would appear that the antecedent of the conditional
sentence of the second paragraph in R1597 holds.  So, what might
prevent Indulgences from being destroyed, as required by R1579?

The answer is the precedence taking R1435.  This states that
"Indulgences are a Currency".  This statement must remain true,
whatever R1579 says to the contrary.  My Fellow Justice elJefe claims
that this is possible if one reads "Indulgences are a Currency" as
"Indulgences are a destroyed Currency".

This is a senseless contortion.  We do not need to put the rules
through such hoops.  We have rules taking precedence over each other
all the time.  When we read "Indulgences are a Currency", we know that
this is equivalent to stating that there exists a Currency whose name
is "Indulgences".  But now the opposing argument wants us to
simultaneously read this as admitting the precise opposite, that this
Currency doesn't exist at all.

I refuse to make the Rules play such tricks.  If a high precedence
rule says that Indulgences exist, then the lower precedence R1579 can
yammer on about Mintors and the lack thereof all it likes.

Indulgences exist.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Original Judgement: TRUE

Reasons and arguments:

The caller's argument appears to be incorrect:

> Therefore, the specification "the Player who is required to report
> the change in Blots" points to no particular Player, since the Rules
> charge no Player with the responsibility of keeping a record of any
> particular Payment Orders.

This is formally contradicted by Rule 1596, which state, in part "Each
Recordkeepor shall maintain a record of all Payment Orders executed
which specify the Currency of which e is the Recordkeepor..."

However, as I have argued in CFJ 929, Indulgences having ceased to be
a Currency, no POs can issue in terms of them, and so no player is
authorized to execute such POs pursuant to anything.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Rule 1435 goes : to gain or receive Blots is to be subject to a PO for
the same number of Indulgences, and a Player's Blots is the total
amount of such Transfers e has been ordered to effect (that are not
disputed or vacated). Thus a "change in Blots" is precisely the
executing, disputing or vacating (but unfortunately not the
satisfaction) of such a Payment Order.

Therefore, the specification "the Player who is required to report the
change in Blots" points to no particular Player, since the Rules
charge no Player with the responsibility of keeping a record of any
particular Payment Orders.

The Rule defining Adjacency got Virus-Infected.  It was agreed that all
existing Adjacencies were permanently destroyed by this (as they were
no longer defined by an effective Rule), and that arbitrary Movement was
possible for the Infection period (as no Rule prohibited it).  [The latter
implies that arbitrary Movement was possible before, and will be possible
after Disinfection, which I believe has happened now.]

Much too wide definition of Nomic Properties. For example, this would
make it a Nomic Property of a body of text to which Players it has been
made available (see Rule 1513), making posting something (anything!) to
the discussion list, the Public Forum or another Player disallowed unless
specifically authorized by the rules...

Among the other things which would not be allowed to change if the definition 
of Nomic Property were changed in the way you propose are:

- the time in GMT (Rule 458)
- the meaning of a word (Rule 754)
- a Player's belief as to the truth of certain information (Rule 1497)

And that's just what I found after a short scan of the ruleset.

Um, those Blots should be going to Morendil, as Elde's executor.  Look

True for the Indulgence debt, but it looks to me like blots for other
Infractions go directly to the Player.

OTOH, if you try to define NE in a way that matches "intuition",
you have a problem, as what is intuitively a NE to one person
may not be to another.

I'm interested to hear what use you would make of the distinction
you propose?  I'm not quite sure how your definition
would fit into the limits we've been attempting to impose
via 1011 et al.

You mean in case someone does object?  My intention was if
the relevant Officer (or other Player) thought it a reasonable
change, but it was objected to, e should then just try to
accomplish the change by Proposal.

Thus, VTs are not NEs, since they have the property of being

I agree about changing to "agora", but I'd rather stick with
the full "discussion", "business", and "official".  Makes
it a little easier for new/prospective players, I think.
And I doubt it's a matter of repeatedly typing the addresses
out (everyone does have aliases for these, right? :)

Actually, with the definition of NE that I have suggested, there would be no
way to make use of the distinction, because everything accessible to Agora is
by definition a Nomic Entity.  I guess a better way of putting it is that with
*my* intuitive notion of what is a Nomic entity, there are no distinctions
between entities within a Nomic that can be drawn from this concept.

I must admit that it now seems equally intuitive to me to define the concept of
Nomic Entity as being the conceptual entities established within a Nomic (as
opposed to the physical entities).  Seems like finding a good legal definition
of this may be difficult though.  I still would like to know how Nomic entities
would be treated differently than non-Nomic entities.

Then why make the formal distinction at all?  Perhaps what I'm
trying to say is that I realize that in my draft, what is or
is not a NE may be counterintuitive, but (IMO) what we
lose in intuitiveness we more than make up for in utility.

I think this is necessarily an inherent part of judicial exercise.
When the actual content of the law is under dispute, it becomes an
evidentiary matter, and the judge has to make an evidentiary finding
as to what the law says before he can apply it to make a determination
of the proper application of that law.  I don't see how you can
prohibit judges from being empowered to find that the reported law is
incorrect, and consequently basing a ruling on what the judge believes
to be the correct form of the law.

In part, this reminds me of Marbury v. Madison, and Justice Marshall's
discussion of the legality of adopting unconstitutional laws.

Exactly.  From this point of view there is no point in having a formal

I accept this.  What I'm trying to find out, unsuccessfully so far, is exactly
what utility we get out of having a Nomic/non-Nomic Entity distinction that we
don't get out of having a Nomic/non-Nomic Property distinction.

I'm assuming that the format of Antimatter's
appeal judgement is correct and that this
establishes the existence of Indulgence POs. 
Unless someone can convince me otherwise, I will
regard this moment as the time when all currently
disputed POs for Indulgences have been removed
from dispute and put back to normal.

I think we need to get a similar finding on
P-Notes, but I can find no CFJ that clearly
establishes an answer for them, so:

CotC take note:

I hereby submit the following Call for Judgement.

Although all individual P-Note entities were
destroyed by the PC proposal, the Currency class
of P-Notes was re-established by R1701 immediately
after their destruction by R1579, making it
possible to legally issue POs for P-Notes since
the PC proposal took effect.

Argument:  As I have noted in a previous post, the
wording of R1579 indicates that it applies to the
single instant at which a Mintor or Mint authority
ceases to exist.  Since R1701 continues in effect
after that instant in time, it re-establishes a
Currency called P-Notes that does not have a
Mintor and is then not subject to R1579 since it
defines a new Currency (albeit with the same name
as an old one) for which a Mintor has never ceased
to exist.

Destruction and creation, I guess. It is nice to be able to say that a
destroyed Currency is not a Currency at all any more, for example.

However, that could be achieved simply by having some kind of special
catch-all class which everything (including naturally extra-Nomic
Entities, physical or not) belongs to by default, and just move destroyed
things to there.

Greetings,

To paraphrase, at least in the case of my draft, you are saying,
"A NE is simply something which does (or can) have NPs assigned
to it; to assign a NP to something, you must first declare it
to be a NE.  Why bother with the declaration at all?"  (Feel
free to correct if this is not a fair assessment of your
statement.)

Yep.  conversely, for abstract entities, it seems rather
awkward to define them to have NPs without defining them
to exist, first.  Although they don't have to be defined
to be NEs to be defined to exist, I suppose.  Still, I
think it's easier to regulate creation and destruction
if you have some general term to refer to those things
created and destroyed.

I am thinking that we should stop using the terms "creation" and
"destruction" because we are finding ourselves forced to interpret
them in "creative" ways far too often.  In general, it's more sensible
to withdraw things from the purview of the Rules than to state that
they are "destroyed".

In one of the early drafts of the Pragmatic Currencies reform, there
was no procedure for creating or destroying Currencies; rather, there
was a set of rules for determining if a thing is a currency, and a
procedure for bringing a currency under the regulation of the Rules,
and another procedure for terminating such regulation.  (There was
also a clause that no currency minted, coined, or regulated by a
member of the United Nations could be also be regulated by Agora.)  If
a currency's characteristics changed such that it no longer met the
mandatory criteria for regulation, it ceased to be regulated, but
continued to exist, and could even theoretically become regulated
again.

I ran into difficulties with this paradigm, and discarded it, but I
think now in retrospect it might be a far better one than anything
else we've concocted.

Yes, that's a good paraphrase of what I was trying to say.

(You don't need to destroy something in order to be able to say it's not a
Currency anymore.  You remove the property of being a Currency from it and then
you can say it's not a Currency.  I'm not sure how this relates to the need for
a concept of Nomic Entity.)

Hmm.  I would think "entity" is enough of a general term, or "abstract entity"
if you want to restrict the regulation of creation and destruction to those. 
Although I suppose it's reasonable to formalize the notion of abstract entities
that have been created by procedures or rules within Agora by the term "Nomic
Entity".

I'm inclined to agree with Scott.  I don't see too much of a problem with
talking about "creating" an abstract entity, although "defining" seems more
eaccurate to me.  But talking about "destroying" them is more problematic.  A
concept doesn't get detroyed, although it may be forgotten.

I tend to prefer an evidentiary approach.  Officer's reports would be
deemed to be prima facie evidence of the truth of the facts contained
therein, but a judge could rule, if presented with sufficient evidence
to the contrary, that the report is, in part or in whole, not factual
and (a) enjoin the Officer in question to repair the error and (b)
utilize the facts e determines to be correct in any further
determination of fact or of the application of law to fact that e is
required to perform, as part of judicial process.  I would also allow
Officers to amend their reports sua sponte, to avoid unnecessary calls
for judgement or other judicial process.

Of course, what constitutes "sufficient evidence" will have to be
discovered over time.  We have no evidentiary code at present; one
will probably evolve over time were we to adopt the model described
above.  Further, I think this model fits more closely with the way we
tend to think about such things anyway.

This system does not state that Officer's reports are absolutely and
unassailably correct, unlike the commonly discussed "strict official
document" model.  Thus it does not suffer from the "error" problem:
there is a conceptualization of error in this model.  Nor does it
suffer from the undetectable events problem of the strict Platonic
model: facts are only judicially cognizable if there is evidence to
support them.  An undetectable event is not cognizable, because there
will be no evidence of its occurence.  (Again, what is and is not
evidence will need to be settled.)

I would also, of course, make it a serious crime to knowingly present
a falsified Official Report, but that's separate from the method of
challenging the correctness of such a report by presenting evidence of
its errors.
