The argument is based on my view of precedence/deference claims as
second order provisions in Rules, which are used to resolve conflicts
between first order provisions. If there is no conflict between first
order provisions, then there will be no need to invoke any second order
provisions. On my view, second order provisions cannot be used to avoid
conflict between first order provisions - that would be to treat the
second order provisions as first order provisions themselves, which in
my view is confused.

According to my view, R1030 says: when Rules of equal Power contain
first order provisions which are in conflict, and a consistent set of
second order provisions for resolving the conflict, use the second order
provisions. If the second order provisions are themselves in conflict,
then use the procedures outlined herein to resolve the conflict.

And R1482 says: when Rules of unequal Power contain first order
provisions which are in conflict, then ignore any second order
provisions those Rules may contain, and give precedence to the higher
Powered Rule.

Aha!  Now I understand your viewpoint.  Thanks for the clarification.  However,
I see nothing in the Rules that grant a "primary" or "secondary" status to any
provisions in a Rule.  Is this some kind of meta-game principle upon which you
are drawing?
