Hi! PCGAME.COM will soon be announcing an exciting new Yahoo-style directory of game sites (expected to launch around November 15th), and we'd like you to be a part of it.

PCGAME.COM is currently the largest game-specific search-engine on the web, with over 20,000 URLs and around 400,000 users/month. We are the game-search experts (specializing in this since 1996), and we're going to do everything we can to ensure that our directory is simply the best. 

To that end, we'd like to make sure that the best game-related sites are represented. That's why I'm contacting you with this invitation. A handy Add-URL form is included below, which you may use to make sure we have the right description of your site(s) for our directory. Please take a few minutes to fill it out and return it to this e-mail address (addurl@pcgame.com). You may duplicate the form as many times as necessary if you are involved with more than one site.

What's in it for you? New exposure and more traffic, of course.

If you're already familiar with PCGAME.COM (http://www.pcgame.com/), you know that our current search-engine focuses on links to game publishers and magazines. Our new directory will focus more on the best sites (and will cover all game platforms - so don't worry if your site is not about "PC" games).

I know you're very busy, and I appreciate your time. Please return this form as soon as you can so that we can process it before we are swamped (each form will be read and processed by an actual person). Thanks in advance for your support!

Sincerely,
Mike Pooler
