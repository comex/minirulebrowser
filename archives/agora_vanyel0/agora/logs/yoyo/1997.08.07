Yes, but it tends to hurt one's head. :)

Rule 1710 does not create a legal presumption of the validity of the
Cartographor's Report, although one could argue that one is
established by Rule 1497.

Of course, the idea of presumptions is meaningless so long as Agora
lacks any concept of a code of evidence.

>This is a plug for PerlNomic

Interesting that this idea should pop up.  IMO, a Perl nomic would not
be a true nomic -- there would be at least some part of the Perl program
that cannot be modified.  A while ago, however, I came up with a way to
implement a fully modifiable nomic in Lisp.

The usual type of implementation of the eval function in Lisp (when it is
implemeted as Lisp code) naturally stores the code it is to execute as
a list.  The variable values in the subordinate Lisp environment are,
similarly, lists.  With a slight modification, the Lisp code being
interpreted could be made visible to itself, as a variable, such that
it could modify itself while it is executing.

If one accepts such a modified eval function running on a normal Lisp
interpreter to be a valid language interpreter -- the language being a
variant of Lisp in which the program can self-modify -- and thus outside
the Game, one could construct the most pedantic nomic possible.  Question:
would this be the ultimate in Platonism or the ultimate in Pragmatism?
It is Platonic in that there is no way for Players to misinterpret the
Rules, or to make mistakes in recordkeeping.  But it is also Pragmatic,
in that what determines the game state is what happens during the
execution of this nomic on whatever actual machine it happens to run on.
This may be affected by such real world considerations as power cuts,
other tasks running on the machine, and bugs in the Lisp interpreter.

And another philosophical question arises: could such a nomic ever impose
obligations on Players?  As the Rules are actually a computer program,
it might appear that they can only determine what the host computer does.
Would meta-game agreements be required in order to ensure maintenance
of the host system?

No.  Mail delivery programs get messages one at a time, and need no
delimiter.  It is up to the MDA to ensure correct delimiting of messages
that they add to the user's mailbox.  The usual Unix convention is that
the MDA adds a "From " line to the top of the message, and changes any
occurrence of "From " in the body of the message to ">From ".

A less common convention -- used on some SysV systems -- is to add a "From
" line to the top of the message and add an accurate Content-Length:
header in the message.  This is a very bad protocol, for a number of
reasons.  A mailbox using this convention looks exactly like one using the
BSD convention, but can have a different interpretation.  It relies on it
being possible to add a certain header to the message without affecting
its meaning.  The length is specified in bytes, so that anything modifying
the message has to modify the header, and the mailbox is instantly broken
if it is transferred to a system with a different end-of-line convention.

A better convention is to put mail messages one per file, with the
mailbox being a directory.  This is the only really satisfactory solution,
but unfortunately most mail readers aren't equipped to handle this.

filter is not only much simpler, but is also known to eat mailboxes from

Of course, this begs the question: useful for what? I admit I don't
have a really well worked out answer, but here's a hint: we might
want to institute different rules of evidence for determining the
status of Nomic Entities, since the state of Nomic Entities is tied
much more closely to the reporting of them in Official Documents.<<

I think I've said that before, but I think it would be good to focus
on the game related question of protecting entities from unwanted
manipulation. Thta's really why protective rules like 1011 and 1586
were introduced in the first place, right? And on the other hand
manipulating entities in, well, at least unforeseen or surprizing ways
is part of the fun of a Nomic (see MMM, or Ackanomic's win in
InterNomic), and explicitly encouraged by 116.

So: what properties of which entities do we want to protect from
unwanted tampering? Maybe this could be connected with responsible
players rather than abstract protective rules: Changes of Nomic
Properties (or anything concerning Protected Entities - I liked that
phrase when I saw it, sorry that I don't remember who brought it up)
only become valid when the responsible officer enters them into the
record e maintains; other players or rules can only demand that an
officer make such changes. Just as the PC orders work for currencies -
this would work for names of entities and all other kinds of
properties, too. 

The game state (concerning entities and their properties) would then
be fixed by what the relevant reports say. This would also guarantee,
e.g., the existence of locations, as listed in the cartographor's
report.

Steve:

>>But I don't think so: even without R1011, I cannot see why we should
think that my making such a post has the effect of placing Harlequin
On Hold, any more than we should think that my announcing to the
gathered Monopoly players, "I hereby steal $100 from the Bank"
actually has the effect of moving a $100 bill from the Bank to me.<<

No, maybe not. But this kind of theft by announcement is not the
important thing. The more realistic kind of theft in an ftf board game
would be just to take money out of the bank quietly, without anybody
noticing. And if the amount is so small that for the rest of the game
nobody notices that someone got rich quick, the theft will have been
successful. Same goes for the player who is responsible for the bank
mixing up eir own money and the bank's.

_This_ kind of theft is impossible in an email based game, with the
exception of hacking the relevant files and of mistakes or cheating by
relevant officers. But it is only physically impossible. It still may
be fun, nevertheless, in a game where cheating or, more generally,
unexpected game moves are part of the game concept. So the way to make
it possible in an email game would be to explicitly allow "cheating"
and, of course, require it to be made publically. The key to success
is then not secrecy as in ftf, but sticking to "meta" rules like R116. 

Steve, of course, argued the same point in eir example of "off hold"
badges. 

Steve:
>>But we're not playing an ftf game, and so we don't use coloured badges
or money, or other physical tokens which are easy to steal. We use
data stored in files for everything. This makes it enormously 
difficult to manipulate the physical representations if you don't
own the files.<<

I think the crucial difference between cheating in an ftf game and in
an email game (where this "cheating" is part of the game concept, at
least) is not in the physical or not physical manipulation of
tokens. The requirements for success differ: Secrecy and going
unnoticed long enough are needed in an ftf game; an email game needs
more elaborate (meta) rules, that in principle make some kinds of
"cheating" formally legal again. I guess that's what 116 is for. Of
course then it's not really cheating anymore, just playing cratively
and doing unexpected things, like MMM. And this should be encouraged,
IMHO.

I mentioned it mainly to point out that it is futile to spend a great
deal of effort coming up with complex methods to describe how
Proposals take effect, because all of them are bound to hit the
Paradox regardless.  You cannot avoid the paradox, so instead you
should embrace it and move on.

Crito:

>>Seems to me the solution is not to prevent proposals from creating
entities, but to restrict it in such a way that information about such
entities is adequately preserved for the life of the entity after the
proposal has been enacted.<<

I see two ways to do that:

- Connect every entity with a player responsible for it (e.g. mintors
for eir currencies, Cartographor for all locations etc.); make em
report regularly (or on demand only, maybe) on the existence and
properties of entities ey control.

- Create a Zoo of Entities, a place where all existing entities and
eir properties are listed. This might be a rule (which has to be
amended everytime an entity is created or destroyed - this would put
these acts under the same restrictions as amending rules in general),
or another entity, or a newly invented Zookeepor's report, or
whatever.

I'd prefer the first variant.

Yes, but you couldn't join a Contest that had one; transferring a negative
Entry Fee is illegal.

Good point.  I'll submit a revised proto shortly.

That's not so. Scott, as Assessor, can transfer 5 VTs from himself to
you without telling anyone at all, even you. Such a transfer is
effective immediately.  Similarly, Scott can vote without telling
anyone, also effective immediately.

Amend Rule 1539 by replacing the text

      A Player becomes a Contestant by notifying the Contestmaster and
      paying the prescribed Entry Fee to the Contest Fund.

with

      A Player becomes a Contestant by notifying the Contestmaster and,
      if the Contest has a nonzero Entry Fee, paying that Entry Fee to
      the Contest Fund.

[Comment:  Allows Players to join zero- or no-Fee Contests as common sense
 would dictate.  I considered allowing more complex Entry Fees, e.g. "3 VTs,
 or 3 P-Notes, or 1 VT + 1 P-Note", but those can simply be implemented as

 v1.1:  Per Steve, clarified that Contests with zero or nonexistent Entry
 Fees may be joined without having to attempt to pay any Entry Fee.]

Well, it could be directly dependent on the date plus the status of other
elements of the game state at the beginning of that day.  But in either case, I
think your viewpoint is consistent with the second one I described (the Rule
doesn't change the game state, it just provides a formula that must be used
when determining the actual effects of other actions that *do* change the game
state).  I hadn't thought of using the argument that the Symbol of the Day is
*not* an element of the game state.  That seems counterintuitive to me, but I
would be interested in knowing exactly how you would define what is an element
of the game state.  I'm not sure it's necessary to deny its status as part of
the game state.  Rather, one could still argue that the Rule does not change
it, only the act of observing it changes it, i.e. the Symbol of the Day is in
an indeterminate state until some Player actually calculates what it should be
for the day - and that calculation is what actually changes it.  Or you could
say that it only becomes part of the game state when you actually use it in
determining the effects of other actions.

While I am certain that if the only record of VTs was destroyed, we
would be "up the creek without a paddle", I don't see how this follows
from any claim of Platonicity.  The claim is equally true in the
paradigm I espouse.  However, under the evidentiary model I espouse,
it is possible to reconstruct a "best approximation" without breaking

tolerate this.

I would not that it is absurd.  I would hold that it is unfortunate.

While I feel the phrasing of such a proposal is less than desirable (I

that to be a ratification of the recorded game state as legally
correct, any actual errors notwithstanding.

I truly believe that the belief in any sort of ephemeral VTs separate

useless confusion without creating any useful functionality that I can
see.

The recent debates over what are Nomic Entities, Nomic Properties,
and what Proposals may achieve prompted me to draft this outline
for a major revision of the Rules, in order to more clearly resolve
such problems.  A general definition of Nomic Entities and Properties
is avoided; rather, whatever the Rules state are Nomic Entities
are.  It should be noted that this method would include as
Nomic Entities many things that are natural Entities, and,
as such, are not currently Nomic Entities under any interpretation
of Rule 1011.  For example, all persons, living or dead, would be
Nomic Entities.

The Game State is uniquely and completely defined by all Nomic
Entities, the Class to which each belongs (if any) and the
Property/Value pairs of each entity; thus, the definition of
what constitutes a Game State Change and what Proposals and
other Instruments may achieve is greatly simplified.

The following represents a mere framework for such a system;
I have not split the various provisions into what would be
actual Rules, nor determined what the Powers of the Rules
would have to be; but clearly, many of these would have to
be high-Power Rules.  (Also, I think many of these would
be candidates for the much-neglected Power=2. :)

If we did try to do something like this, I imagine it might
require such a large-scale rewrite of the Rules that 
Pragmatic Currencies would look like a mere cosmetic
change in comparison.  Even if we don't do this, I'll
probably submit this as a Thesis.

Chuck

============================================================

DEFINITIONS

A Nomic Entity (NE) is anything defined by the Rules to be
a Nomic Entity.  This may either be done directly, by a
Rule defining the existence of a specific Nomic Entity,
or indirectly, by a Rule defining a Class of Nomic Entities.
In addition, if the NE is not explicitly defined by the Rules,
the Rules must require a Player to record the existence of
that NE, or else explicitly state that no Player is required
to record the existence of that NE.  If a NE does not meet
this requirement, it is destroyed.

The only Classes of NEs which exist are those explicitly
specified by the Rules.  A NE may not belong to more than
one Class of NEs.  A Class of NEs is not itself a NE.
The Class to which a NE belongs (if there is one)
is set when the NE is created, by the Instrument which
creates the Entity.  

[My objection to defining classes of NEs distinct
from, and not being, NEs themselves is rooted in
the current version of 1011.  As this system would drop
that, having defined classes becomes more desirable.]

[There will be no overlapping classes, meta-classes,
or subclasses.  Where it might seem reasonable
to do such a thing, I believe the desired effects can
be achieved by mere terminology.  For example, persons
will be a class of NEs.  Players will not be.  Rather,
"Player" would simply be shorthand for "A person for
whom the value of the Property Registration is True."]

A Nomic Entity which is created comes into existence,
for the purposes of this Nomic; a Nomic Entity which
is destroyed ceases to exist, for the purposes of this
Nomic.

A Nomic Property (NP) is anything defined by the Rules to
be a Nomic Property.  In addition, to be a NP, the Rules
must state the possible values of that Nomic Property.

NPs are assigned to NEs by the Rules.  Each NP assigned
to a NE has a value for that NE, which must be one of
the possible values for that NP, or else the NP is
undefined for that NE.  To avoid confusion, no NP
may have the value of the string "undefined" or strings
which differ from it only in capitalization, punctuation,
and/or whitespace.  However, this shall not be taken to
mean that an undefined NP has the value of the string
"undefined".  An undefined NP has no value.

[Undefined NPs are to be avoided; however, I am
not disallowing them on the grounds that accidentally
forgetting to set the value of a NP should not be
a fatal error.  And in some cases it will be useful
to have undefined NPs for short periods.]

For a NE to be assigned a NP, the Rules must specify
a Player to record the value of that NP, or else
explicitly state that no Player is required to record
the value of that NP.  If the value of a NP for a given
NE ceases to be a possible value of that NP, the
value of that NP associated with that NE becomes
undefined; unless the possible values of the NP
are defined as sets, in which case the NP is changed
by removing those members of the set necessary to
make the value of the NP equal to a possible value.

[It might seem reasonble, and it would certainly be possible,
to make the Class of a NE also a NP; however, I think Class
is sufficiently different from NPs that it is preferable
to treat it separately.]

Nomic Entities only have those Nomic Properties specified
by the Rules.  Thus, if a Rule assigning a Nomic Property
to a NE is repealed (and no other Rule assigns that NP
to that NE), that Nomic Property is removed from that
Nomic Entity.

NEs may not be NPs, nor are NPs assigned to NPs.
The value of a NP, however, may be a NE or set of
NEs.

When a NE is destroyed, all NPs are removed from it.

THE GAME STATE

Thus, a listing of all Nomic Entities, the Class to
which each belongs (if any), and the Property/
Value pairs associated with each would consitute a
complete record of the current Game State.

The only possible Game State Changes (GSCs) are thus of
the following types:
  * Creation of a Nomic Entity
  * Destruction of a Nomic Entity
  * Assigning a NP to a NE
  * Removing a NP from a NE
  * Changing the value of a NP assigned to a NE
  * Changing the Class (or lack of such a Class)
    to which a Nomic Entity belongs.

[Changes of this last type would be exceedingly rare, but
not unheard of; recall that we recently made the Wizard an
Office.]

[Creating a new Class of NEs (but not any NEs belonging
to that Class), or creating a new NP (but not assigning that
NP to any NE), or changing the possible values of a NP are not
directly GSCs; rather, they are achieved by changing
the defining Rules, and the Body of a Rule is a
NP of that Rule.]

TERMINOLOGY

When a set of NEs has a small, specifically limited
set of possible values for one of their NPs, reference
may be made to NEs with a specific value for that NP
by appropriately citing that value.  If another NE has
that same value as a NP which has a large set of
possible values, that NE does not necessarily fall
into that set.

[Exapmles: Proposals have the NP P-Status, which has as
its possible values Submitted, Distributed, Completed,
and Reported.  "Reported Proposal" thus refers to
those Proposals which have "Reported" as their P-Status;
and not necessarily a Proposal which has "Reported"
as the value of its Title (also a NP).  Organizations have the
NP O-Type, which has as its possible values Group and
Contest.  "Contest" thus refers to any Organization
with the value of O-Type equal to Contest, and not
to a Currency whose Name has the value "Contest"]

SOME COMMON POSSIBLE VALUES FOR NOMIC PROPERTIES

A NP which is defined to be a Boolean Nomic Property
has the possible values of True or False.

A NP which is defined to be an Index has as its possible values
all nonnegative numbers, and Unanimity.  In comparing Indices,
Unanimity is greater than all numerical values.

A NP which is defined to be a Body of Text has as its possible
values all strings of text.  Two Bodies of Text which differ in
their value only in whitespace are considered to be identical.

A NP which is defined to be a Line of Text has as its possible
values all strings of text with length no greater than 60 characters,
and containing no whitespace other than spaces.

["Line of Text" is perhaps a bit inaccurate, as it does not
end with a carriage return or line feed.  This will become
important when some NPs are defined as sets of lines of text:
in reporting those, the "Lines" need not appear on separate
physical lines.]

CONTINUITY OF ENTITIES

[Incidentally, it should be noted that the intent under
this system is that each Currency will be a NE, but
units of the Currency will not.  Rather, for each Currency,
each NE which is an Owner (Players, Organizations, the Bank,
and Estates) will have the NP of Currency-Holdings, a
non-negative integral multiple of that Currency's MUQ.]

A NE which does not belong to any Class exists only as
long as a defining Rule exists; if there ceases to be any
defining Rule, the NE is destroyed.  

A NE which belongs to a Class exists as long as the Class of
NEs to which it belongs is defined by the Rules, unless an
Instrument causes it to be destroyed.  If the Class to
which a NE belongs ceases to be defined by the Rules,
the NE is destroyed.

POWER

Every NE has the NP of Power, an Index.  If the Power
of a NE would be undefined, it instead is set to zero.
No Player is required to record the Power of NEs whose
Power is zero, except as may be required by other Rules.

[It should be noted that Power serves three different purposes.
First, as a measure of an Entity's resistance to change.
Second, as a measure of an Entity's ability to change other
Entities.  Third, as a determining factor in conflicts
between NEs.  It would be possible to separate these into
separate Indices: Resistance, Ability, and Precedence; however,
this would be an unnecessary complication at this time.  It
is important to note, however, that all three of these functions
will not apply to all NEs.]

INSTRUMENTS

[It has long been observed that the Rules have two basic
functions: to define the game state, and to place obligations
on players.  There are also other entities which perform each
of these functions: proposals, applications, and persons can
all effect game state changes (among others), and Injunctions
and SLCs can place obligations on players.  I call anything
which can set or change the game state "Instruments", and
anything which can impose obligations, "Charges".  Rules
are both Instruments and Charges.  It is theoretically possible
to separate the Rules into two distinct types of entities,
one which only sets the game state, and one which only imposes
obligations ("Principles" and "Laws", perhaps), but that would
represent an unnecessary complication at this time.

Note that my usage of "Instrument" is somewhat different than
its present usage, defined to be any entity with Power>0.
In this system, an Instrument is any entity which may effect
GSCs, and may have Power=0; conversely, entities with Power>0
are not necessarily Instruments (although I cannot off-hand
think of any reason why we would want a non-Instrument NE
to have Power>0.)]

Any Nomic Entity belonging to one of the following Classes (and
no other entity) is an Instrument:
  * Rules
  * Proposals
  * Referenda
  * Applications
  * Organizations
  * Persons

["Instruments" is neither a NE, nor a class of NE, nor a NP.
"Instrument" is simply shorthand for "A Rule, Proposal, Referendum,
Application, Organization, or Person."]

[I would plan to expand the definition and method of Application
to include anything else which might cause a GSC and not easily
fit into one of the other Classes.  Actually, it would be possible
to combine Proposals, Referenda, and Applications into a single
Class, but that represents an unnecessary complication at this time.]

Only Instruments may cause Game State Changes.  Instruments with
Power greater than or equal to one may cause any Game State Changes
not prohibited by the Rules.  Instruments with Power less than
one may only cause Game State Changes as permitted by other Rules.

[1011, 594, and some of 116 all rolled into one concise
paragraph. :)]

The following Game State Changes are permitted to the Rules only,
and may not be made by any non-Rule Instruments:
  * The creation of a Nomic Entity not belonging to any Class.
  * The destruction of a Nomic Entity explicitly defined by the Rules.
  * Changing the Class (or lack thereof) of a Nomic Entity explicitly
    defined by the Rules.
  * Assigning a Nomic Property to a Nomic Entity.
  * Removing a Nomic Property from a Nomic Entity.

When a Nomic Entity is created, the values of its Properties
may be set by the Instrument which created it, if not set
by the Rules.  If the initial value of a Property is not set either
by the Rules or by the Instrument which created it, that
NP is undefined.

All NPs of a Rule are either Substantive or Non-Substantive.
All NPs of a Rule are Substantive unless a Rule with Power
equal to or greater than that of the first declares that
the NP is Non-Substantive.

[Again, Substantive and Non-Substantive are terminology--
not NEs, Classes, or NPs.]

No Instrument may make any changes to a NE (including creation
or destruction) unless the Power of the Instrument is equal
to or greater than that of the NE being changed; nor may
any Instrument change the Power of a NE to be greater than
that of the Instrument; with the following exceptions:
  * The value of a Non-Substantive NP of a Rule may be
    changed by any Instrument with Power greater than
    or equal to one; or by any Instrument, as permitted
    by other Rules.
  * The Power of an Adopted Proposal, upon becoming
    Reported, may be changed by any Rule with Power of
    at least one to any value not exceeding the Voting
    Index of that Proposal.

TIMING AND MANNER OF GAME STATE CHANGES

Any Game State Changes effected by a Proposal or Referendum
take place at the moment the Instrument becomes Reported.
Any Game State Changes effected by an Application take
place at the moment the Application becomes Executed.
If any of these Instruments claims to make a GSC at
a different time, the GSC does not take place.

[Execution of Applications would also be changed--whereas
currently, any Application can be executed, but may
only be effective if it has enough Signatures, I would
change it so that the Application must have sufficent
Signatures before it is executed.]

Any Game State Changes effected by an Organization or
Person take place in the manner and time specified in
other Rules.  If no other Rule specifies the manner
in which a GSC permitted to an Organization or Person
may be achieved, it may be achieved by means of a post
to the Public Forum.  If no other Rule specifies the
time at which such a GSC takes place, it takes place
at the time of the action which directly causes the
GSC.

If the Class to which a NE belongs, or the value of a
NP assigned to a NE, is explicitly specified by the
Rules, then that Class or value may not be changed
by a non-Rule Instrument.

CHARGES

[Anyone have a better name for this?  "Charge" used in
this way ("something which imposes an obligation")
seems slightly archaic.  But "Injunction" is already
taken, and "Obligations" "Duties" and "Tasks" all
seem to refer more to the obligation itself, rather
than to the entity which imposes the obligation.]

[This section doesn't really have that much to do with
the rest of this draft, but since I'm enumerating things
which can cause GSCs, I might as well enumerate things
which can impose obligations as well.]

Any Nomic Entity belonging to one of the following Classes (and
no other entity) is a Charge:
  * Rules
  * Injunctions
  * Organizations

[I forsee that the scope of Injunctions would be greatly increased,
so that, for example, a Proposal could create an Injunction.  
Although it might be better to create a new Class for such
things--I'm not quite sure which option is better yet.  It
may seem a bit odd that I say "Organizations" and not "SLCs" here,
but SLCs will be Properties and not Entities.  It's not that odd,
anyway, considering that something similar applies to Rules,
where their Body is one of their NPs.]

Only Charges may place obligations on Players.  No Nomic
Entity may place an obligation on a non-Player person.

Rules and Injunctions may place obligations on any Player, as
stated in their Bodies.  Organizations may place obligations
only on Players within their Jurisdiction, as stated in
their SLCs.

[There is no effective difference between an obligation imposed
by a Rule, and one imposed by an Injunction created by
Proposal, except that the former takes precedence in a
conflict.  In practice, Rules should be used for ongoing
obligations, while Injunctions created by Proposal should be
used for one-time obligations.]

If two Charges of different Classes impose conflicting obligations,
then Rules take precedence over Injunctions and Organizations,
and Injunctions take precedence over Organizations.

If two Injunctions impose conflicting obligations, the more
recently created one takes precdence.

If two Organizations impose conflicting obligations on a
Player (and neither is superceded by a conflicting Rule
or Injunction), there is no precedence; the Player is still bound
by both.

[i.e., the Player will have to leave one organization in
order not to violate the Rules.]

[Precedence between conflicting Rules is already defined.]

NAMES

There exists the Nomic Property of Name, a line of text.

No two NEs may have the same Name.  Any Instrument, other
than Rules or Proposals, which attempts to change the Name
of a NE to be the same as the Name of another NE fails.

If the Rules define two NEs to have the same Name, the
Name which is defined by the Rule of lower precedence
is instead undefined.

If a Rule or Proposal gives to a NE a Name which is
already the Name of another NE, whose Name is not
explicitly defined by the Rules, the Name of the latter
NE becomes undefined.

If a Proposal attempts to change the Name of a NE to
be identical to that of an NE whose Name is explicitly
defined by the Rules, the attempt fails.

Any undefined Name may be changed by any Player.

[Note this section does not itself assign the NP of
Name to any NE.  Also note that Name is not the same
as Title.

Why not simply allow different NEs to have the same
name?  Mainly for Currencies, the creation of which
will cause the creation of a related NP assigned
to each Owner.]

EXAMPLES

[This section deals only with how this system would work
in an ongoing state, not the thorny problem of how to
bootstrap it.  Also, these are quite limited examples,
and in most cases do not include all NPs which would
be assigned to given NEs.]

There is a Class of Nomic Entities known as Persons.
All real persons, living or dead, are members of
this class.

Persons have the Nomic Property of Registration, a
Boolean Nomic Property.  Persons for whom Registration
is True are called Players.  "Registering" is
synonymous with changing a Person's Registration
from False to True, and vice versa for "deregistering".
The Registrar shall record the existence and Registration
of all Players.  No Player is required to record the
existence and Registration of non-Player Persons.

[It might end up being more convenient to have more
than two possible values for Registration, in order
to denote ex-players.  Never, Current, Recent, and
Past, for example.  I haven't looked at the Rules
regarding ex-Players to determine if this would be
desirable.]

Players have the Nomic Property of Activity, a
Boolean Nomic Property.  Players for whom Activity
is True are called "Active" or "Off Hold"; Players
for whom Activity is False are called "Inactive"
or "On Hold".  The Registrar shall record the Activity
of all Players.

Players have the Nomic Property of Name.  A Player
may change eir own Name.  The Registrar shall record
the Name of all Players.

------

There is a class of Nomic Entities known as Rules.
The Rulekeepor shall record the existence and all
Nomic Properties of Rules.

Rules have the following Nomic Properties (in addition
to others which may be defined elsewhere):
  * Number (a positive integer)
  * Amendment Number (a non-negative integer; this is a
    non-Substantive Property)
  * Title (a line of text; this is a non-Substantive
    Property)
  * Body (a body of text)
  * Annotations (a set of bodies of text; this is a non-Substantive
    Property)
  * Originator (a line of text; this is a non-Substantive
    Property)
  * Authors (a set of lines of text; this is a non-Substantive
    Property)
  * History (a body of text; this is a non-Substantive
    Property)
  * Categorization (a Rule Category; this is a non-Substantive
    Property)

Repealing a Rule is synonymous with destroying it.

When a Rule is created, its Properties are assigned values
as follows:

Its Power is set to that stated by the Instrument which
created it; if it does not so state, it is set to 1.

Its Number is set to the smallest integer larger than any
other previously assigned to a Rule.

Its Amendment Number is set to zero.

Its Annotations is set to the null set.

If the Rule was created by a Rule, its Originator is set to
"Rule " followed by the number of the Rule which created it;
if created by a Proposal, to the Name of the Instrument which
created the Proposal, at the time it was created.

Its Authors is set to a set of a single line of text, identical
to its Originator.

Its History is set to the null string.

[Other Rules will define how the Rulekeepor goes about
changing a Rule's History.]

The Rulekeepor may change any undefined non-Substantive
Properties of a Rule.

[Title and Categorization are not defined by this Rule;
thus, if not defined by the Instrument creating the
Rule, they are initially undefined.]

When the Body of a Rule is changed, its Amendment Number
shall be increased by one.

------

Entities belonging to the following classes are Owners:
  * Players
  * Organizations
  * Estates

In addition, there is a Nomic Entity known as the Bank,
and it is an Owner.  No other NE is an Owner.

[Again, Owner is just shorthand.]

Every Owner has the Nomic Property of Executor, a Player.
A Player is eir own Executor.  The Chancellor is the
Bank's Executor.  The Notary shall record the Executors
of Organizations and Estates; no Player is required
to record the Executors of Players and the Bank.

[which will not change the fact that the Registrar
will be required to record who holds the Office of
Chancellor, from which the identity of the Bank's
Executor can be easily deduced.]

[Morendil's latest actions show, I think, that we
need to make a distinction between a Player authorized
to expend currencies on behalf of an Entity, and
a Player authorized to act more generally on behalf
of an Entity.  For the sake of this example, I use
"Executor" to refer to the former.]

There exists a Class of Nomic Entities known as
Currencies.  Currencies have the Nomic Properties
of Name, Creator (an Instrument), Recordkeepor (a Player),
and MUQ (a positive number).  The Creator of a Currency
is the Instrument which created it.  If a Currency has
undefined Name, Creator, Recordkeepor, or MUQ, it is
destroyed.  The Chancellor is required to
record the existence and all Properties of Currencies.

For each Currency which exists, there exists the Nomic
Property of <Currency>-Holdings, where <Currency> is
replaced by the Name of the Currency.  The possible
values of these Properties are non-negative integral
multiples of the MUQ of the associated Currency.  If
the value of such a Property assigned to an Entity
would be undefined, due to the MUQ of a Currency changing,
it is instead set to be the greatest possible value which
is less than its value before the MUQ changed.

All such <Currency>-Holdings NPs are assigned to all
Owners.  When such a NP is first assigned, its value is
zero.  The Recordkeepor of a Currency shall record the
<Currency>-Holdings of that Currency for all Owners.

The Creator of a Currency is the Instrument which created
it.

Players and Organizations may create Currencies.  A Currency
which has a Player as its Creator has that same Player
as its Recordkeepor.  A Currency which has an Organization
as its Creator has that Organization's Actor as its Recordkeepor.

["Actor" meaning the Player more generally authorized to act
on behalf of an Organization.  Not a particularly good term,
but this is just for the sake of example.]

------

There exists a Class of Nomic Entities known as
Offices.  Offices have the Nomic Properties of
Name, Incumbent (a Player), and Manner (which has
as its possible values: held in the normal fashion,
held temporarily, and delegated).

[I've always thought that it would be simpler to
have delegated as a third manner of holding office,
rather than a special case of the normal fashion.]

Offices which are held in the normal fashion or
delegated also have the property of Expiration
(a date).  The Registrar shall record the existence
and all Properties of Offices.

"There exists the Office of X" is synonymous with
"There exists an Office with Name X".  In contexts
where a Player is required, the Incumbent of an
Office may be referred to by the Name of that Office.

If the Incumbent of an Office would be undefined, it
is instead set to be the Speaker.

------

There exists a Class of NEs known as Nomics.  All
nomics are members of this class.  Nomics have
the NP of Friendliness, which has as its possible
values Friendly, Neutral, and Hostile.  The Ambassador
shall record the existence and Friendliness of Friendly and
Hostile Nomics.  No Player is required to record the
existence or Friendliness of Neutral Nomics.

This Nomic has the NP of Name.  Its Name is Agora.
Every Player is required to record the Name of this
Nomic. :)

No problem that I know of.  How strange.  Note that I _did_ get this one,
and the e-mail header seems to indicate the right address.  I did send my

unrelated reasons).

I don't consider things which are determinatively calculatable solely
from other elements of the game state to be themselves part of the
game state.

Hypothetically, let's discuss the age of a given Proposal; that is,
number of days since a Proposal was proposed.  I would deny that this
is part of the game state, because it is determinatively calculatable
from the present time and the date and time at which the Proposal was
proposed.  The date and time at which the Proposal was proposed is,
however, a part of the game state.

I do not believe it is useful to assign membership to the game state
of properties which are wholly derivative of other properties.  Such
properties often change frequently, if not continuously, and in
practice they are computed every time they are used.  It does not make
sense to me to treat such derived properties, which cannot be directly
set to anything by any conceivable action, to be on a par with
intrinsic properties, which are subject to direct manipulation.
Obviously, therefore, only intrinsic properties need to be protected
from untoward manipulation; derived properties are, by their very
nature, not subject to manipulation.

This sounds like something out of quantum theory.  I think you can
avoid all confusion here by distinguishing intrinsic and derived
properties, recognizing that the Symbol of the Day is a derived
property, and affording it appropriate consideration in light of that
status.

Examples of intrinsic properties: 
	the AI of a Proposal
	a Player's Vote
	the name of a Currency
	the condition of being the member of a Group

Examples of derived properties:
	the VI of a Proposal
	the list of members of a Group
	the total number of units of a Currency in existence

There are some properties that I'm not sure whether they are intrinsic
or derived, such as the Power of a Rule.  I have to think about this
some more.

Is it just me, or is the idea of "legalized cheating" somewhat
antinomic?  Cheating is defined as playing outside the Rules.  If you
bring cheating within the rules, it's no longer cheating.  I don't
consider loophole surfing to be cheating; it's just "creative play".

By the way, cheating is not impossible in Agora.  It is quite possible
for the Assessor to "cheat" with respect to Rule 452, for example.  Or
for a Player to make a random selection nonrandomly and to
subsequently lie about having done so.  The Assessor could also cast
eir votes after the end of the Voting Period without anyone knowing.
These are acts that are properly described as cheating.  Such acts
are, of course, illegal; that's what makes them cheating, as opposed
to simply creative play.  Basically, any time a game action is
predicated on an act performed by a Player in a manner which is not
subject to verification, there is the opportunity for cheating.  There
are not very many such opportunities in Agora, thankfully, and most of
the opportunities that do exist do not present great advantage for
doing so.  (Players may wish to consider the possible consequences of
a Clerk of the Courts who consistently cheats on random selections,
however.)

An excellent distinction, although, as your next sentence makes clear, it
doesn't look like it would avoid *all* confusion 8).  I guess I tend to think
of both intrinsic and derived properties as part of the game state, but I can
see that it is not necessary to consider derived properties as such.

I suppose you could say that it is a derived property, since it is derived from
the text of the proposal that set the Power of the Rule.

Yes, thank you. That is what I wanted to say, put very clearly. Now
the question is: why is it impossible to change things just by posting
to the public forum, like in my MMM-currency renaming attempt? Because
it is cheating of a different sort? I think that game moves of that
class would be easier to organize ftf, but I wouldn't mind seeing them
as a possibility in an email based Nomic - as an example of "creative
play".

>>Impractical, since there are an infinitude of possible entities.  Who
shall have the obligation to be responsible for keeping track of feral
cats in Australia, for example?  "Entity" is a terribly broad term.<<

No, no, that's just the point: such a Zoo would not contain a list of
all entities you can think of. Rather, it would only contain those
entities and properties which are a) related to Agora and b) are
supposed to be protected from arbitrary manipulations.

Such a list would not serve as a "description" of anything, and of
course not a complete description, either. But being on this list
would be equivalent to being a Nomic Entity or Property in the current
framework; "equivalent" not in the sense of metaphysics, but in terms
of game design: there are entities/properties which we want to protect
from arbitrary manipulation. 

At the moment we try to protect them by defining the abstract concept
of Nomic Entity/Property (E/P) and say that such E/Ps are
protected. And then we run into lots of problems decicing whether a
particular E/P is a Nomic N/P under the existing, abstract definition,
etc. etc. 

We could also protect things by putting them on a list (in the Zoo)
and say: "Everything in here is protected, do not feed - erm, change,
I mean, the animals without express permission by some rule." So this
list would contain only a limited number of entries.

An example for a small Zoo of this kind is InterNomic Rule 323:

>>It is forbidden to alter the essentials of the game state except as is
explicitly or implicitly permitted by a rule or a set of rules. The
essentials of the game state consist of the rules themselves, the
scores of the member nomics, the proposals, the vote cast on
proposals, the statements for judgement and verdicts returned upon
them, and anything else so designated by some rule. No other things
are included in the essentials of the game state.<<

Short, but I think it follows the general idea: define the protected
E/Ps by enumeration, not via an abstract definition.

That's not so. Scott, as Assessor, can transfer 5 VTs from himself to
you without telling anyone at all, even you. Such a transfer is
effective immediately.  Similarly, Scott can vote without telling
anyone, also effective immediately.
<<

There is another type of influence an officer can have without
directly communicating with someone or not. E is not always told
exactly how and when to do things, and can use this freedom: The
promotor can delay publishing proposals (within the ASAP, but
nevertheless), thus determining the voting period and possibly
influencing the outcome; the Herald just started publishing the
contents of various wills, which e had not done before - things like
these are not illegal, they do not even change the game state
directly, but they still influence the game.

By the way, if I understand R1552 correctly, the
ratification provisions of P3543 will be without
effect, since both Reports in question were
superceeded by other versions prior to the
distribution of the Proposal.  Also, since the
contents of these reports depends on the outcome
of some of the CFJs currently in appeal, it is
arguably the case that these reports were subject
to pending CFJs or appeals at the time of
distribution.

The other provisions of this proposal are much
needed (well the birthday thing is not *much*
needed 8), so I think it's a good idea to get this
one in place anyway.  It will take a bit more work
to get Indulgence and P-Note holdings into a
desirable state.

Is it? We keep on debating this for years, but I don't think anyone has
made a clear CFJ yet... I am not sure how to write one, myself.

The intuitive answer is that there is no reason why we should attach any
particular significance to a piece of text, when the Rules don't say it
has any.

In the opposite direction one might argue that the PF message is merely
the _reporting_ of the change, and that Players have a right by 116 to
change things at will... but this creates its own problems about
non-reporting.

Greetings,
rjan.

The technical aspects of this are probably a little beyond my grasp,
since it's now 6 years since I had to do any programming in Lisp, 
or indeed any programming at all. But I don't understand why the
choice of language as between Perl and Lisp should make such a
difference to the question of full modifiability.

What are the Players suppposed to do in such a Nomic? Submit Proposals
the effect of which is to modify the effect of the program?

That usually means that either (a) your system has inadequate locking
or (b) your procmail was incorrectly compiled.
