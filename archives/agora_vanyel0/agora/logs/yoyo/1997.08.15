And what interesting comments they are, too! I'm really looking forward
to having a law student playing the game. As a philosopher, my interest
in the game has also been jurisprudential, and so I'm naturally interested
in what kinds of arguments get made, and which accepted, and why.

It's true that, other things being equal, any Active Player can Judge.
But the composition of the Appellate Court is not so arbitrary, as you
doubtless will have observed, being composed of Players who are likely
to be experienced in the game. (Although the current situation with 
respect to CFJs 930 and 932 is interesting: there seems at least the
prospect of inconsistent Appellate Judgements on the two cases, because
the Boards are differently composed.) The current judicial system
developed in part because of experience obtained playing Nomic World,
a MUD-based Nomic which was in a way a prior incarnation of Agora. In
that game we found that allowing just anybody to serve as an Appeals
Judge led to inconsistent Judgements, which led to more CFJs to resolve
the inconsistencies, which like as not would be Appealed and again
Judged inconsistently, and so on. Respect for the judicial process ebbed.
Players were less willing to abide by its determinations and generally
sought to keep cases open by making more CFJs, hoping to get a favourable
Judge. There's really no point in making multiple CFJs in the current
system, since the same Board is likely to end up hearing the case if
it goes to Appeal - although interesting use might be made of the barring
mechanism in this respect.

Seems right to me.

Well, we young'uns don't know about his Olden Days of Playerhood.  He has
certainly done more since he deregistered than when he was most recently
a player, though.

Rule 1478, in part:

      The Executor of an entity is a Player who is empowered by the
      Rules to act on behalf of that entity, as if e was that entity.

      Except when the Rules stipulate otherwise, a Player is eir own
      Executor.  Any other entity has an Executor only when the Rules
      specify either a Player or a means to designate a Player to be
      the Executor of that entity.

I believe that, if Derek returned, e would fail to be eir own Executor,
thanks to the "Except when" clause.  (I believe an older version of R1478
had no such clause, and would thus conflict with the Probate Rules, and
win said conflict.  Which is presumably why the clause was added.)

Reregistering one's charge is certainly an interesting way of getting out
of being an Executor in Probate...

This statement may be too broad. It's certainly true if one replaces
'Nomic' in line one by 'Agora'. But some Rishonim might well disagree on 
this point, for example. There the Rules mean what the Players think they 
mean (at least such has been argued there), while in Agora the Rules mean 
(as litteraly as possible) what they say, no matter how, why or when they 
got their text.

Am I right in assuming that this means that there aren't any time limits
left for judging a CFJ (as long as the infection stays here)?

I think I'll make a viral antidote proposal, upmutating some rules which
would cause too much trouble if infected (I think about Rules on the making
of and voting on Proposals and the basics of the judicial system) to, say
MI=1.5. I had thought about that before, but other things got in the way
and I forgot about it.

Appeal decisions

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Justice Murphy's decision: to OVERTURN and reverse decision

I agree with Judge elJefe that the Caller's argument is incorrect.

Rule 1435 ("Indulgences exist") takes precedence over Rule 1579 ("all
Currencies must have a Mintor; any Currency ceasing to have one is
destroyed").  Even accepting CFJ 929's claim that Indulgences were
destroyed (which seems to be a conflict between those rules),
Indulgences are then resurrected with no Mintor.

I therefore consider the Statement false for lack of evidence.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Justice Michael's decision: to OVERTURN and reverse decision

Reasons and arguments:

If Indulgences exist, then a Payment Order was executed by the
Chancellor when he attempted to transfer 9 Indulgences from the Bank
to Elde.

If Indulgences exist, then the Indulgence Currency's Recordkeepor is
authorised to record and execute Payment Orders (R1596).

Thus, if Indulgences exist, the correct judgement for this CFJ is
FALSE.

The argument that Indulgences do not exist is based on R1579, which
states that all Currencies have a Mintor and if a Currency should lose
its Mintor, then it is destroyed.  It is accepted that an entity known
as the Mint was the Mintor for Indulgences before the Pragmatic
Currencies reform occurred.

By virtue of R1586, we must also accept that the Mint no longer
exists, so it would appear that the antecedent of the conditional
sentence of the second paragraph in R1597 holds.  So, what might
prevent Indulgences from being destroyed, as required by R1579?

The answer is the precedence taking R1435.  This states that
"Indulgences are a Currency".  This statement must remain true,
whatever R1579 says to the contrary.  My Fellow Justice elJefe claims
that this is possible if one reads "Indulgences are a Currency" as
"Indulgences are a destroyed Currency".

This is a senseless contortion.  We do not need to put the rules
through such hoops.  We have rules taking precedence over each other
all the time.  When we read "Indulgences are a Currency", we know that
this is equivalent to stating that there exists a Currency whose name
is "Indulgences".  But now the opposing argument wants us to
simultaneously read this as admitting the precise opposite, that this
Currency doesn't exist at all.

I refuse to make the Rules play such tricks.  If a high precedence
rule says that Indulgences exist, then the lower precedence R1579 can
yammer on about Mintors and the lack thereof all it likes.

Indulgences exist.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Justice Antimatter's decision: to OVERTURN/reverse the decision

I vote to OVERTURN this appeal, with the comment that ordinarily I would
decline judgement, but since my fellow Justices are agreed, I might as
well go along (since I can't change things anyways).

======================================================================
Original Judgement: TRUE

Reasons and arguments:

The caller's argument appears to be incorrect:

> Therefore, the specification "the Player who is required to report
> the change in Blots" points to no particular Player, since the Rules
> charge no Player with the responsibility of keeping a record of any
> particular Payment Orders.

This is formally contradicted by Rule 1596, which state, in part "Each
Recordkeepor shall maintain a record of all Payment Orders executed
which specify the Currency of which e is the Recordkeepor..."

However, as I have argued in CFJ 929, Indulgences having ceased to be
a Currency, no POs can issue in terms of them, and so no player is
authorized to execute such POs pursuant to anything.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Rule 1435 goes : to gain or receive Blots is to be subject to a PO for
the same number of Indulgences, and a Player's Blots is the total
amount of such Transfers e has been ordered to effect (that are not
disputed or vacated). Thus a "change in Blots" is precisely the
executing, disputing or vacating (but unfortunately not the
satisfaction) of such a Payment Order.

Therefore, the specification "the Player who is required to report the
change in Blots" points to no particular Player, since the Rules
charge no Player with the responsibility of keeping a record of any
particular Payment Orders.

(Caller's) Arguments:

As I have noted in a previous post, the wording of R1579 indicates
that it applies to the single instant at which a Mintor or Mint
authority ceases to exist.  Since R1701 continues in effect after that
instant in time, it re-establishes a Currency called P-Notes that does
not have a Mintor and is then not subject to R1579 since it defines a
new Currency (albeit with the same name as an old one) for which a
Mintor has never ceased to exist.

I believe the statement is FALSE.  It is clear that R1701 doesn't take
precedence over the rule requiring that Currencies have a Mintor (and
that they should be destroyed if they don't).  If a purported Currency
doesn't have a Mintor, then I believe that R1701 tells us that it is
not a Currency.  Given that in this case, this provision is not
overridden, P-notes aren't a Currency, whatever else they might be. 

Michael.

Because of the recent infection of rule 408, this CFJ is in Limbo.
In particular, there is no rule specifying that Swann is no longer
eligible to Judge the CFJ in question, so the provisions of R951 do
not apply, and we just have to sit and wait for Swann to either return
judgement or for the rule to return to effectiveness.

(In case you were wondering.)

I don't follow this.  What wording in R1701 tells us that P-Notes are not a
currency if they don't have a Mintor?  Maybe you meant R1579, the rule that
calls for the destruction of Currencies when their Mintor ceases to exist.

But R1579 does *not* say any entity without a Mintor is not a Currency, it says
if a Currency ceases to have a Mintor than *that* Currency is destroyed. It
makes no statement about the class of Currencies in general, only about how
individual instances of that class are to be treated.  It says nothing about
what should be done to a Currency that never had a Mintor.  If we passed a
proposal that established a brand new Currency, Zlotys, without specifying a
Mintor for it, your interpretation would mean that Zlotys were not a Currency. 
I would disagree with that interpretation, since it is clear here that Zlotys
never had a Mintor that ceased to exist.

P-Notes seem ambigous here because the name refers to a Currency that was
destroyed.  My contention, however, is that the destruction caused by R1579 was
total, as seems clear from its wording, and since R1701 was not repealed nor
had its Power reduced by that action, it is still effective in declaring a
Currency called P-Notes, which is as much a brand new Currency (post
destruction) as Zlotys would be, except they have the same name as the old
Currency that was destroyed.

I'm going to a mathematics conference in Nordfjordeid, a pretty remote
little place whose only claim to fame is being the birthplace of
mathematician Sophus Lie (although he left as soon as he could :-), and if
things haven't changed greatly since the last time I was there I probably
will not have Internet access for a week. So just to be sure, I hereby
move to the Stasis Chamber. 

Distributor Steve: If it should happen that we move to the new lists while
I am away, could you please s-bscribe me? That includes also the
discussion list.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

I hope for his sake Derek never takes a look at any other e-mail Nomics --
Agora is still the most anal-retentive and uptight Nomic out there. :) I
sure don't have a problem with the silliness, to a degree (look at what
Group I formed...) Besides, there was some silliness going on before, too.

R1579 says "Each Currency shall have associated with it a Mintor,
which must be an entity to which the Rules grant Mint Authority.  An
entity has Mint Authority if and only if granted it by the Rules."

This is a requirement on Currencies that P-notes don't satisfy.
Therefore P-notes are not a Currency.

I have nothing to add other than that we should have a Currency called
Zlotys. With a MUQ of 1,000. :)

Chaos Harlequin
Thinking of the counterfeiter who spent 800,000 Zlotys on a printer that
only let him print up 40,000 Zlotys before he was caught...

Hmm.  The problem I have is with that word "shall" as opposed to "must".  I've
never thought of the two words as synonymous, but that may be the only way to
interpret this.  It seems to me to be putting an obligation on something to
associate a Mintor with each Currency, but fails to specify what or who that
something is and fails to specify the time frame in which the association shall
take place.  But I guess the only way to interpret this then is, as you say, to
consider this a condition which an entity must fulfill in order to be
considered a Currency.

OK, let's put this to the Courts... I haven't reviewed the arguments pro or 
contra on the issue of the FM's existence myself, but the debate should be 
interesting.

H. CotC, I hereby Call for Judgement on the following Statement :

---
At the time of Player's Morendil posting eir message attempting to transfer one 
VT to the Frankenstein Monster, no Entity authorized to possess Currencies 
existed which could be unambiguously referred to as "the Frankenstein Monster".

Pah ! Just do what I do... Lie. :)

Actually, I got back sooner than I anticipated... A good thing too, it seems.

H. Herald, please note my transfer of one Kudo FROM Steve, for lack of
imagination (there were after all *lots* of more interesting ways to deal with
that issue), TO Elde, to compensate for what I deem to be a very unfair 
deKudoing on Vanyel's part, and...

One Kudo FROM Vanyel, for the abovementioned reasons, TO Vlad, glad to have em
back.

I also hereby announce as Elde's Executor, on Elde's behalf, that Elde is
actively participating in Agora. ;)

Oh boy. How far can this go ? I hereby Announce as Elde's Executor, on Elde's
behalf, that Elde, acting as Blob's Executor, on Blob's behalf, requests the
registration of Blob.

Yeah, I know that this is a dangerous business, what with the problem of 
Cascading Indebtedness and all, but I'll ride that wave. Or at least try to, 
and hope that I don't wash out. :)

Meanwhile, I think it's not a good idea in general that Executors in Probate
should be subject to Infractions of Persistent Indebtedness committed by
Entities other than themselves, since that would very likely lead to EiPs
desisting time and again from their duties when assigned the estate of a
Player with Debts.

Therefore, I hereby submit the following Disinterested Proposal :

(Proposal 1)
---
Amend Rule 1713 by replacing text which reads :

      The Executor of an entity for which, at the beginning of a given
      Nomic week, there is at least one Overdue Payment Order naming
      it as Payor commits the Infraction of Persistent Indebtedness at
      the beginning of that Week.  If an entity has more than one
      Overdue Payment Order naming it as payor, its Executor commits
      as many such Infractions are there are different Currencies
      named in all these Overdue Payment Orders.

with text reading :

      The Executor of an entity for which, at the beginning of a given
      Nomic week, there is at least one Overdue Payment Order naming
      it as Payor commits the Infraction of Persistent Indebtedness at
      the beginning of that Week, unless that Entity is currently in Probate.

      If such an entity has more than one Overdue Payment Order naming it as
      payor, its Executor commits as many such Infractions are there are
      different Currencies named in all such Overdue Payment Orders.
---

It also seems strange to me that Fugitive Blots should be separate, rather
than converted from, regular Blots; I therefore also submit the following
Disinterested Proposal:

(Proposal 2)
---
Amend Rule 1437 by replacing text which reads :

      When an Player is deregistered from the game while not
      Immaculate, e becomes a Fugitive from Justice, and e receives
      Fugitive Blots equal to the number of Blots e then had.  The
      Herald shall keep a record of the number of Fugitive Blots
      attributed to each Fugitive from Justice.

with text reading :

      When an Player is deregistered from the game while not
      Immaculate, e becomes a Fugitive from Justice, and e receives
      Fugitive Blots equal to the number of Blots e then had.  The
      Herald shall keep a record of the number of Fugitive Blots
      attributed to each Fugitive from Justice. All Blots held by that
      Player previous to eir deregistration shall be erased, i.e., all Payment 
      Orders for Indulgences naming that Player as Payor shall at that time be 
      vacated.
---

(A further Proposal is at the end this message.)

Lastly, I have a problem with the Appellate Judgement in CFJ 932. The esteemed
Judge elJefe prefaced eir Judgement with an argument that led em to believe
that the Statement would have been FALSE, if not for the status of
Indulgences, which e deemed not to be a Currency.

In Judging its Appeal, the Justices essentially put forth arguments that
Indulgences do exist, and I have no contention with that decision or their
arguments supporting it. However, the argument which was rejected by Judge
elJefe was not considered by the Justices, or at the least the arguments 
attached to their Judgements did not at any time touch upon the issue.

I therefore feel within my rights to submit the following Statement, which I 
hope the Courts will address as such rather than rule on peripheral issues. 
Please note that I am well aware that within our current Judicial system, the 
decision of an Appellate Court is final, and it is not usually proper to 
challenge an Appellate decision by issuing an essentially similar Statement; in 
this instance, however, it is my sincere belief that the Statement in 932 has 
not been properly adressed which motivates this admittedly inelegant 
insistence.

I have appended the Statement of 932, part of Judge elJefe's decision, and some 
additional commentary on the Statement and attached arguments.

I hereby Call for Judgement on the following Statement :

---

   No Player is currently required to report a change in Blots resulting from 
   the commission of an Infraction.

---

Arguments :

   A Recordkeepor is a Player who is required to maintain a record of
   past and present Payment Orders naming a particular Currency. To
   fulfill these obligations, it is necessary, and sufficient, that a Player 
   should be able, if called upon to do so under Rule 1064 (FOIA), to provide 
   upon request a list of all Payment Orders naming that particular Currency 
   that have been executed in the last four Weeks, and their status.

   No additional obligation is imposed upon a Recordkeepor with respect to 
   Payment Orders, or to any given set of Payment Orders. In particular, a 
   Currency Recordkeepor is not required to keep track of "changes in the total 
   amount of Payment Orders executed, but not disputed or vacated", which is 
   the long-winded expansion of the legal shorthand "a change in Blots". A 
   Recordkeepor is a fortiori not required to *report* such changes, which 
   makes Rule 1435's designation of "whomever is required to report the change 
   in Blots" vacuuous.

   To sum up : if I were the Recordkeepor for Indulgences, no Rule could 
   currently _require_ me to post a message to the Public Forum whenever a 
   Player's Blots changed.

   Are some other Players required to post reports of such changes ? This 
   responsibility could conceivably fall to Players required to post Reports of 
   Infractions. The reasoning would be : "A report of an Infraction committed 
   by a particular Player leads to a Blot penalty assessed against that Player, 
   and thus constitutes a report of a change in Blots".

   This inference, however, misses one crucial step. A "change in Blots" is the 
   result of a Payment Order in Indulgences being executed. But the report of 
   an Infraction is not, in and of itself, a Payment Order, and thus the 
   requirement to report an Infraction cannot simultaneously constitute a 
   requirement to report a change in Blots.

   A solution to this problem would be to enact Implicit Payment Orders, the 
   mirror image of Implicit Transfer Orders, which - employed with the same 
   caution which was reserved to ITOs - would restore reports of Crimes and
   Infractions to their full effectiveness.

Statement of CFJ 932:
======================================================================
                               CFJ 932

"No Player is currently authorized to execute Payment Orders for
 Indulgences pursuant to penalties expressed in terms of Blots."

======================================================================

Excerpt from Judge elJefe's reasoning :

---
The caller's argument appears to be incorrect:

> Therefore, the specification "the Player who is required to report
> the change in Blots" points to no particular Player, since the Rules
> charge no Player with the responsibility of keeping a record of any
> particular Payment Orders.

This is formally contradicted by Rule 1596, which state, in part "Each
Recordkeepor shall maintain a record of all Payment Orders executed
which specify the Currency of which e is the Recordkeepor..."
---

I now realize that my initial arguments were misleading. It is indeed false
that "the Rules charge no Player with the responsibility of keeping a record
of any particular Payment Orders". My meaning was that "the Rules charge no
Player with the responsibility of keeping a record of the _changes_ in the
status of any particular subset of Payment Orders", and I should have focused 
on the word "report" in 1435 in particular. I apologize for the confusion.

To correct the situation I outline above, I also submit the following 
Disinterested Proposal :

(Proposal 3)
---
Enact a Rule (titled "Implicit Payment Orders") reading :

   The Rules, and only the Rules, may specify that certain actions, such as
   reporting Infractions, are also implicitly the execution of one or more
   Payment Orders, as long as the action which is implicitly the execution of a
   Payment Order is the sending of a message to the Executor of the source entity
   of the Payment Order or to the Public Forum.

[Comment : the substance of 1731; there are no Delayed Payment Orders, and it 
is not necessary to deal with cancellation as the COE Rule already permits an 
illegally submitted PO to be vacated if needed.]

Enact a Rule reading :

   The act of reporting an Infraction, and the act of submitting a Judgement 
   which finds a Player guilty of a Crime, constitute as many Implicit Payment
   Orders of the appropriate amounts of Currencies as are necessary to carry 
   out the penalties specified in the Rules.

[Comment : authorizes Players required to report Infractions to
simultaneously, and implicitly, execute POs.]

Amend rule 1435 by replacing text which reads:

      A Payment Order for 1 Indulgence, the payee of which is the
      Bank, is called a Blot.  When a Rule states that a Player is to
      gain some number of Blots, a Payment Order shall be executed
      with that Player as the payor, the Bank as the payee, and for a
      number of Indulgences equal to the number of Blots that Player
      is to receive.  This order is to be executed by whomever is
      required to report the change in Blots.

by text reading :

   When a Rule describes a penalty as an amount of Blots, this shall be
   equivalent to requiring the execution of a Payment Order for the same amount
   of Indulgences, naming the Player who is subject to that penalty as Payor 
   and the Bank as Payee.

[Comment: brings 1435 in line with the new protocol for assigning Blots.]

I wonder. Rule 1478 does not make me identical to Elde; I am still, in addition
to being Elde's Executor, subject to any obligations or restrictions applicable
to 'Player Morendil'. For instance, if a Rule prevented me from posting any
messages at all to the PF, I guess I would be unable to post messages even on
Elde's behalf, since even if the actions contained therein would be legally
attributed to Elde, I would still be the Player posting those messages.

I would think just the opposite.  Being subject to Infractions caused by the
debt of the estate should make the EiP want to wrap things up quickly to get
all those debts vacated before any penalties befall em.

This is the idea I originally had for implementing currencies, which
in retrospect I should have used.  Comments?

(This is not a Proposal.)

======================================================================

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1467 be amended to read:

      A "currency" is any class of objects with attributed value
      utilized (or utilizable) as a medium of exchange.

      Instances of a currency are called "units" of that currency.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be created, with the title
"Regulation of Currencies" and the following text:

      Certain currencies may be designated as "regulated."  The
      designation of a currency as regulated is a Nomic Property of
      that currency.  

      The above notwithstanding, no currency shall be designated as
      regulated when such designation is in conflict with any other
      Rule, and a regulated currency shall cease to be regulated if
      its continuing regulation would offend the Rules.

      The Chancellor shall retain a schedule listing all regulated
      currencies, and shall publish this schedule as soon as possible
      after it changes for any reason.

      The possession or trading of instances of a regulated currency
      contrary to the Rules shall be subject to penalties under the
      Rules.

      All Rules pertaining to the possession and trading of regulated
      currencies shall be construed proscriptively.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be created, with the title
"Prohibition on Regulation" and the following text:

      Under no circumstances shall any currency minted, issued, or
      regulated by any member of the United Nations be designated as a
      regulated currency by or under the authority of the Rules.  

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be created, with the title
"Requirements for Regulation" and the following text:

      Every currency to be regulated by the Rules shall meet with the
      following requirements:

      * It shall have a name unique from all other currencies
        regulated by the Rules.

      * It shall have a Recordkeepor charged to maintain an accurate
        and complete record of the number of units of that currency
        attributed to be possessed by the various entities who might
        possess it, and of all transactions involving that currency
        which may take place between those entities.

      * It shall have at a Mintor, which is the only entity who may
        create new instances of that Currency.

      In addition, in order for a currency to be regulated, its
      Recordkeepor must be a Player, and its Mintor must be an entity
      with an Executor.

This will not always be possible, if only because of the provision whereby an
EiP is required to refrain from Executing any Transfer Orders arising from
disputed Payment Orders naming the estate under eir responsibility. When POs
are disputed, they can remain that way for a long time - initial CFJ, selection
of a Judge, returning Judgement, publication of a Judgement, can take up to a
month even in cases where no Judge defaults. We've had CFJs hanging around for
much longer, what with defaults and Appeals.

In general it will be _much_ easier for an EiP to resign from such duties than
to fulfill them, especially if the Notary's selection of an EiP is as whimsical
in the future as it has been to date. Path of least resistance and all that.
