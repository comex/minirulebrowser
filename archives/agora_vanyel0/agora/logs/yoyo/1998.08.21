I don't follow this argument.  R1030 specifies that deference clauses can be
used to resolve conflicts, but I don't see how it prevents a deference clause
from being effective even when there is not a conflict.  R1030 says, in effect
and in part, "if there is a conflict, use a precedence or deference clause to
resolve it".  I don't think this necessarily prevents precedence or deference
clauses from being used in other circumstances.  IOW, in the absence of a R1030
conflict, a deference clause just has its natural meaning and intended effect.
