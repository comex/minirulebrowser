+ My very first report as Official CinC of Agoran Military Operations!
Woo-hoo! I even get to post this to the Public Forum! :) As such, this
report *is* now subject to COEs and ratification, although what you could
possibly want to COE or ratify is beyond me.

New information marked "+"

 Players confirmed for the Effort against Rishonomic
 ---------------------------------------------------

The following players have explicitly stated their desire to participate in
the effort against Rishonomic, either on n-d, the PF, or in e-mail to
myself. If you wish to participate, and are not on this list, please e-mail
me, n-d, or the PF, stating this desire, so you can be officially counted.

Players marked with a "*" are those I know to already be registered in
Rishonomic.

Andre 
Antimatter *
Blob 
Chuck
Crito
Elde 
General Chaos *
Harlequin *
Murphy *
Oerjan 
Steve 
Vanyel 
Zefram 

 Current Information
 -------------------

+ Two proposals are up for vote regarding Player registration: one does it
by proposal, one automatically with a request. Until then, no new players
will be registered.

+ The most recent updated list of Rishonomic Players is as follows:

   Uri Bruck bruck@actcom.co.il Niccolo Flychuck 
   Alex Frenkel frenkel@actcom.co.il Apollo   
   Phil Ackely snowgod@alaska.net snowgod 
   Matt Miller millerw@slack.net IdiotBoy 
   Amitai Goldblit goldy@actcom.co.il Varuna  
   Wally Holland mr_mole@popd.ix.netcom.com You can call me Al 
   Joshua Nave JoshuaN@earthlink.net Narf 
   Joshua Hall-Bachner harlequin@tmbg.org Major Major Major Major 
   Ross Morgan-Linial rmorganl@fred.fhcrc.org Anti-Matter 
     sharsmvk@localnet.com Attila the Pun 
   Ed Murphy ford@bayside.net Physical Ed 
   Voting Gnome voting_gnome@hotmail.com   
   42     
   Scott Goehring scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us General Chaos

Since Murphy is presumably Gnome Buddy at the moment, the Voting Gnome will
be on our side when we put the Proposal up for vote. If all 13 of our
interested players participate, that'll be 14 to 8, which is enough to make
the 3/5 required to pass a Proposal.

Speaker Uri is going away in a week, so someone else will have to be 
Speaker for that time. I have volunteered.

There is no way in hell Uri will let me be Speaker. 


 Schedule
 --------

Currently, the tentative schedule of the invasion is as follows:

* Present-June 1: Continued infiltration of Rishonomic, until all
participating players have joined.  
* June 1: Propose a Speedy Proposal containing the neccesary elements.
* June 2: Call in mercenaries, if neccesary.
* June 3: Exult in victory.


 Other
 -----

No other information at this time.
