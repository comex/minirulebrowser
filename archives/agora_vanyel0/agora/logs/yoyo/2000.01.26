A friendly Hello to all Agorans, and a brief note of possible interest: 
in today's weblog (http://www.davidchess.com/words/log.20000121.html#20000126),
I propose a simple Initial Ruleset for a game of Nomic that might be played
on the weblog.  The Initial Ruleset is of the "at the whim on the Scribe"
style, but of course if a Game actually starts up, anything at all could
happen.  *8)  Any interested Agorans are of course invited to stop by
and comment or take part of whatever...

favor (currently an ex-Player)

Hi favor,

Always nice to hear from you. Any chance of tempting you to become an
ex-ex-Player?

Steve
