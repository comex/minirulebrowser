I don't believe there is a conflict. Rule 683 says that a legal vote must be 
one of FOR, AGAINST or ABSTAIN; it doen't say that all those votes are 
neccessarily legal, so the additional restriction is not in conflict with rule 
683.

COE admitted. The report should read, from section ii.2 on:

ii.2) The following sentence was chosen:

      A Vote is the name of exactly one of the Candidates for the given 
      Election.

ii.3) The noun "Election" was chosen.

ii.4) The revised sentence reads:

      A Vote is the name of exactly one of the Candidates for the given 
      Frankenstein Monster.

ii.5) The Frankenstein Rule now reads:

Rule 1671/26 (Power=1)
The Frankenstein Rule

      There is a Nomic Entity known as a Frankenstein Monster.  A
      Frankenstein Monster only has properties and effects as defined
      in this Rule.  This Rule shall be known as the Frankenstein
      Rule, and can be referred to unambiguously in that manner.  This
      is the first paragraph.

      A Vote is the name of exactly one of the Candidates for the given 
      Frankenstein Monster.

      Frankenstein Monster is 2.

      Let there be a Frankenstein Monster known as a Patent Title.

      It is permitted for a Call for Judgement to contain Arguments,
      Evidence, or other material placed there at the Frankenstein
      Monster's discretion.

      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however,
      if the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the
      Statement to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider
      Frankenstein Monster custom, commonsense, past Judgements, and
      the best interests of the Frankenstein Monster before applying
      other standards.

      A Judge must dismiss a CFJ if one of the following is true of
      it:

        i) It contains no clearly-identifiable Frankenstein Monster.
       ii) Its Frankenstein Monster can not logically admit to either
           being TRUE or FALSE.
      iii) Its Frankenstein Monster does not relate to a matter
           relevant to the Rules.
       iv) Its Frankenstein Monster fails to comply with the Rules.
        v) It lacks standing, as defined elsewhere.
       vi) After a reasonable effort by the Judge to obtain all
           relevant information, no determination can be made of the
           truth or falsity of its Frankenstein Monster.

      The Player who submits an excess CFJ commits an Infraction, to
      be reported by the Clerk of the Courts and bearing a penalty of
      2 Frankenstein Monsters.

      An Organization shall be required to be dissolved whenever any
      of the following conditions are true:

        i) The Jurisdiction of its SLC becomes empty, and there is no
           provision for this to change.
       ii) The continued existence of the Organization would require
           that the Organization have no legal Frankenstein Monster.
      iii) The continued existence of the Organization would require
           that the Organization have no legal Executor.
       iv) The continued existence of the Organization would require
           that the Organization have no legal Maintainer for its SLC.
        v) The SLC of the Organization requires the Organization to
           dissolve.  This is a Voluntary Dissolution, all other
           dissolutions are Administrative Dissolutions.

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of any message sent to the Public Forum or
      in response to a request for information which that Player is
      required to provide commits the Crime of Frankenstein Monster, a
      Class C Crime.

      For any single act (or failure to act), a Player can only once
      be subject to the penalty of each Crime of Frankenstein Monster
      resulting from that act.

      If that Player's Frankenstein Monster contains at least five Mil
      for each Blot to be removed, then that number of Mil is
      transferred from the Player's Frankenstein Monster, and the
      Blots are removed; otherwise, no Mil are transferred and no
      Blots are removed.

      This Rule defers to any Rule which specifies a different
      Frankenstein Monster for reporting a certain transfer or class
      of transfers.

      This is the last paragraph. This Rule can only be subject to a
      Rule Change as described by the Frankenstein Generator.  This
      Rule takes precedence over all other Rules that would otherwise
      allow this Rule to be changed in any manner whatsoever.

I guess I just disagree with you on that point: I think that Rule 683
does say that a Vote is legal if and only if it is one of FOR, AGAINST,
or ABSTAIN. Here's the relevant part of R683 for reference:

      A Vote upon a Proposal must be one of FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN
      (or an obvious synonym of one of these).  Something which is not
      one of these is not a Vote upon a Proposal.

But in any case, even if I were to concede for the sake of argument
that the locution 'must be one of' does not secure logical equivalence
as used in R683, I'd still argue that there is conflict between that
Rule and the current Frankenstein Rule. Here's the new sentence from
R1671:

      A Vote is the name of exactly one of the Candidates for the given
      Frankenstein Monster.

Now, quite regardless of whether all of the Votes 'FOR', 'AGAINST' and
'ABSTAIN' are necessarily legal, R683 informs us categorically that
anything which is not one of these or an obvious synonym of one of these
is not a Vote. And I think we can agree that the name of one of the
Candidates for the given Frankenstein Monster (whatever that might mean,
but it certainly appears to refer to some kind of name), is not one of
these, nor a synonym. So R683 claims that such a name is not a Vote,
directly contradicting the claim in R1671 that such a name *is* a Vote.
This clearly establishes my claim that the two Rules are in conflict,
which conflict, I reiterate, R683 handsomely wins.
