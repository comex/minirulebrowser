Probably record it.  Unlike the FM case, it's pretty clear that "the

A code of evidence is a codified set of principles used when
evaluating evidence pertinent to a dispute.  The reason for such codes
is that no fact can ever be established to be true beyond all doubt;
codes of evidence establish was constitutes sufficient (or
insufficient) evidence to establish a claim as factual.

TIA implies an evidentiary presumption of the _believed_ truth
anything posted to the Public Forum, of anything provided in response
to an Officer's request, or anything provided as evidence in a COE or
CFJ, but the truth of the matter does not necessarily follow from
belief, no matter how fervent.
