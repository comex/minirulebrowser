Well, if it'll help you sleep better, *I* still have a healthy respect
for your opinions. I've been on the losing side of arguments - and
even won arguments with people whom I knew were not stupid - often
enough to have concluded that being wrong is not the same as being
stupid.

To the extent which the rules define what does and does not exist in
Agora, there are a multitude of things which do not exist in Agora but do exist
in fact.  Such things may be irrelevant to Agora but still relevant to the
discussion at hand, especially if they might help other players in
understanding each other's positions.

Agreed.  I believe that Xanadu's registration was illegal, but I'm not
going to make an issue of it at this late date, simply because there
really is no point.  As a so-called Jurist, it doesn't bother me in
the least to know that the game has been in Platonically forbidden
states.  Platonists, on the other hand, get ill merely contemplating
the idea. :)

I rejected the avatar theory because there are serious conceptual
problems with the avatar-player interface, because it adds a layer of
complexity that is not needed, and because it creates ambiguity.  With
the player-avatar distinction, the Rules become, at times, unclear as
to whether they are referring to players or to avatars.
Significantly, it becomes unclear (to me, at least) whether Rule 101
pertains only to players, only to avatars, or to both.

Brother Ockham demands that I reject the avatar theory.  And thus, I
do.

Morendil puts forward the argument that no-one is required to
report the change in Blots due to an Infraction. 

I disagree and point to the general rules for Crimes and Infractions.

In particular, R1504 says:

      Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their
      legal report, and the Player making the report of the Infraction
      shall execute whatever Payment Order(s) are required to apply
      the penalty specified for that Infraction.  If a CFJ later finds
      that the Infraction did not occur, the Judge of that CFJ is
      required to issue an Injunction requiring the Clerk of the
      Courts to vacate the Payment Order(s) originally executed to
      apply the penalty.

Executing a Payment Order (in Indulgences) seems pretty much
synonymous with reporting a change in Blots to me.  Certainly, the
information conveyed to the general public is the same in both cases. 

Michael.

The point is, you aren't playing the game *as* Crito, you're playing the
game *with the nickname of* Crito. Unlike RPGs (like D&D) and other games,
you aren't playing a 'character' in Agora, you're playing yourself. In
other words, in Agora, Crito is not a Player, Crito is another name for
David Albertz, who is a Player. (which makes "Crito is a Player" a true
statement, but these things are hard to talk about without this kind of
confusion :-)

What's your view of Xanadu's registration? It was accepted at the
time, perhaps because we had not yet clarified our views on the
subject. Personally, I think Vlad is right to point to Xanadu as
problem for the person view of Players, even if the problem has
a solution (which I tend to doubt, but I'm open to suggestions),
and also right to suggest that Xanadu's registration provides some
support for the avatar view (not enough, I think, but some). I think
the best thing we can say about it is that we wouldn't now allow it
if it were to happen again. I do wonder, though, if I could or would
be making this argument if Xanadu were still registered.

At any rate, your description of Vlad's view as a deluded conceit
is unwarranted. It may be false, but it's not crazy. In fact, I
generally find that once I drop the assumption that my opponents
in an argument are obstinately wrongheaded, deluded and insane,
that the arguments I have are much more productive. YMMV.

No additional obligation is imposed upon a Recordkeepor with respect
to Payment Orders, or to any given set of Payment Orders. In
particular, a Currency Recordkeepor is not required to keep track of
"changes in the total amount of Payment Orders executed, but not
disputed or vacated", which is the long-winded expansion of the legal
shorthand "a change in Blots". A Recordkeepor is a fortiori not
required to *report* such changes, which makes Rule 1435's designation
of "whomever is required to report the change in Blots" vacuuous.

To sum up : if I were the Recordkeepor for Indulgences, no Rule could
currently _require_ me to post a message to the Public Forum whenever
a Player's Blots changed.

Are some other Players required to post reports of such changes ? This
responsibility could conceivably fall to Players required to post
Reports of Infractions. The reasoning would be : "A report of an
Infraction committed by a particular Player leads to a Blot penalty
assessed against that Player, and thus constitutes a report of a
change in Blots".

This inference, however, misses one crucial step. A "change in Blots"
is the result of a Payment Order in Indulgences being executed. But
the report of an Infraction is not, in and of itself, a Payment Order,
and thus the requirement to report an Infraction cannot simultaneously
constitute a requirement to report a change in Blots.

A solution to this problem would be to enact Implicit Payment Orders,
the mirror image of Implicit Transfer Orders, which - employed with
the same caution which was reserved to ITOs - would restore reports of
Crimes and Infractions to their full effectiveness.

  Published, as of this message

======================================================================

Judgement: FALSE

Reasons and arguments:

Argument is the old saw, "Just because it's permitted doesn't mean
it's possible", specifically in this case the fact that there is a
well-defined procedure in the Rules for granting initial Names to
Currencies created under the aegis of Rule 1722, but no procedure
exists to change these inital Names.

I further reject the arguments that Currencies legally minted under
the provisions of Rule 1722 are not Nomic Properties under the
definition of Rule 1011, in that the property of being named "Payment
Order" and so on is granted to the Entities thus created by Rule 1576,
which requires that all Currencies must have a Name, as the Caller
justly notes, and by Rule 1722, which I interpret as, by implication,
requiring that the name of such a Currency be that which is specified
in the message which purports to create it.

To reason otherwise would lead to a pitfall. If we interpret Rule 1722
as *not* requiring that the specific values of properties attached to
a Currency be those specified in the creating message, but merely
attaching particular conditions to the message which effects the
minting a Currency, which conditions would then be irrelevant to the
actual values of the corresponding properties in the newly created
Currency, then we are left with a Currency which either does not have
any of those properties (and thus cannot legally exist) or for which
the value of those properties is indeterminate, which I find
abhorrent, especially as the same fate must befall *all* Currencies so
created.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Evidence and arguments: See my message of 30.07.97 to the public
forum (attached).

Relevant rules: 116, 1011, 1576. (And, in principle, the other rules
pertaining to the creation of currencies, their properties and the
mintor's and recordkeepor's duties and abilities.)

----Att. 1: Message of 12.07.97 to the public forum (from Morendil)

[header snipped to avoid confusing mail readers]

H. Chancellor,

I hereby announce and effect, on behalf of the Misanthropist's Group,
the creation of three Currencies, with the following characteristics,
as per the provisions of Rule 1722 :

Name: Orders
Mintor: The Misanthropist's Group
Recordkeepor: Morendil
MUQ: 1

Name: Payment Orders
Mintor: The Misanthropist's Group
Recordkeepor: Morendil
MUQ: 1

Name: Transfer Orders
Mintor: The Misanthropist's Group
Recordkeepor: Morendil
MUQ: 1


----Att. 2: Message of 30.07.97 to the public forum (from Kolja A.)

[header snipped to avoid confusing mail readers]

I hereby rename the currencies created by Morendil on behalf of the
Misanthropist's Group in a message of 12.07.97 to the public forum as
follows:

Old name                         New name
---------------------------------------------------------
Orders                           MMM-pounds
Payment Orders                   MMM-shillings
Transfer Orders                  MMM-pence


---
Remark

"Wait, you can't do that! These names are a Nomic Property (NP) of
these currencies and protected by 1011!"

No, they are not. What _is_ an NP is the fact that they do have a
name, i.e. are not nameless. This is explicitly required in 1576, and
not changed by changing the names.

But the particular names were given in a message to the public forum
(unlike the names of rule-defined currencies like VTs, which are given
in the relevant rules). So they are not Nomic Properties, after all,
and not protected by 1011.

Most importantly CFJ 833, but also CFJ 869. I have no WWW-access at the
moment (have to login through a telnet connection), so I don't have the
complete texts, but this is what I wrote in my Stare Decisis-list (which,
as usual, is long overdue in being updated, by the way):

Andre, 833:
The Player and the person being the Player are identical.
The act of registration does not create the Player, it merely causes em to
become a Nomic Entity of the type 'Player'.
elJefe, 869:
If a person who is not a Player performs a legal action (eg by sending a
message to the PF), and later becomes a Player, then that action is an action
by that Player.

Yes, it's a hard thing to swallow. By the way, the registration of
Xanadu was legal I think. There were just some actions which were
purported to be actions by Xanadu, and which were encapsulated in the
(pragmatic) gamestate as such, which (from a platonic point of view)
were just failed attempts of doing an action by a non-player.

I at the time regarded it as a 'public secret'. Most of us would
regard it as officially disallowed, at least I did, but we didn't
want to act on that. Looking back this sounds much too un-platonic
to be accepted by Agora. By the way, I think that under Avatar-like
theories this might have been illegal (meaning 'ineffective', Xanadu
was completely legally subscribed, from a theoretic point of view
there were simply some postings which claimed to come from Xanadu
while they were not) as well.

I agree. Vlad's view is a perfectly reasonable one. It just is the
case that I, probably the majority of Agorans, and certainly some
things in the Agoran past disagree with em. But if it appears that
at the moment the Avatar theory has a majority, and I don't succeed
in making them believe otherwise, I will happily play on in that
worldview. It's not like it is completely inconsistent with the
rules, it does fit with the rules, the fit is only not as good, IMO.

You are missing my point.  'David Albertz playing the game of Agora' is the
abstraction I am talking about.  It has nothing to do with the nickname,
playing a 'character', or being in an RPG.  It simply has to do with the fact
that I am playing a game.  All of us do things *as* Players, it just turns out
that the way the rules are currently written and interpreted, *everything* we
do is being done as a Player in Agora.

DIS: Executor in Probate

Morendil,

In looking at the Probate code, I notice there is no restriction on which debts
can be vacated for an estate in probate.  Looks to me like you may be missing
an opportunity here to have some more fun with Elde and Blob.  As EiP I think
you can vacate *all* of their Indulgence debt by carrying out sections 1
through 5 of the probate code.  Nothing requires you to complete the process
once it's started.  What do you think?

Regards,

BUS: Proto for EiP fix

Amend Rule 1738 by replacing the text which reads:

      The Executor in Probate of an entity is the Executor of that
      entity, and empowered only to submit Transfers Orders for that
      entity.  An Executor in Probate also has the power to execute
      and vacate certain Payment Orders, as specified by the Probate
      Code.  This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which
      would specify a different Executor for an entity in Probate.

      The Executor in Probate of an entity shall, upon eir nomination,
      arrange for the disposal of that entity's assets and debts,
      according to the procedures specified in the Probate Code, and
      shall do so in a timely manner.

      The Executor in Probate of an entity ceases to be its Executor
      in Probate when e announces, in accordance with the Probate
      Code, that the entity is no longer in Probate, or when e
      announces that e resigns as that entity's Executor in Probate.

With text reading:

      The Executor in Probate of an entity is empowered to submit
      Transfers Orders for that entity and to execute and vacate certain
      Payment Orders, as specified by the Probate Code.

      The Executor in Probate of an entity shall, upon eir nomination,
      arrange for the disposal of that entity's assets and debts,
      according to the procedures specified in the Probate Code.

      Once all of the estate's disputed Payment Orders have been
      resolved and all FIA requests concerning the estate's Will and
      Currency holdings have been satisfied, the Executor in Probate has
      one week in which to announce completion of the Probate procedures
      described in the Rules.  An Executor in Probate who fails to
      complete Probate of the estate in the time specified commits the
      Infraction of Obstruction of Probate, which carries the same
      penalty as a Class D Crime.  The Notary is authorized to detect
      and report this Infraction.

      The Executor in Probate of an entity ceases to be its Executor
      in Probate when e announces, in accordance with the Probate
      Code, that the entity is no longer in Probate, or when e
      announces that e resigns as that entity's Executor in Probate, or
      when e is correctly reported as having committed Obstruction of
      Probate.

[Make EiP distinct from an Executor so e only has the power to do what is
required for Probate.  Remove "timely manner" specification in favor
of more explicit time requirements with penalties, which include the
removal of the offending Player as EiP.]

My personal feelings would be to determine whether the local law
applicable to Xanadu's locale (which, if I recall correctly, was New
Zealand) would have allowed the two persons comprising Xanadu to be
treated in law as a fictitious person; if so, I would have considered
Xanadu to be the fictitious person recognized by New Zealand law.  I
consider this to be the most applicable standard available, and the
Rules are considerably silent on the issue.  (I believe the
adjudication that "person" in Rule 869 means "natural person" was
judicially overreaching.)

Oh, to be sure - but that wouldn't be entirely ethical either, I suppose; my
stated reason for not doing anything wrt to the disposition of the estate of
Elde was the perfectly legal one that the Probate Code requires an EiP to wait 
until no Payment Orders naming a terminal estate are disputed any longer.

At the time all this started (and, again, currently) Indulgence POs were
disputed. When CFJ 937 is Judged I will most probably carry out the steps
outlined in the Probate code in full - this has lasted long enough and I see
no reason, apart from wreaking havoc and sowing confusion, to stop before step
9. (Then again, those are *GOOD* reasons ! So if I can think of something to 
further complicate the situation I will do that, rest assured.)

Well, to be honest I had missed that particular provision. It happens to be
much more straightforward than the equivalent provision in 1435; for instance,
of some penalty for an Infraction is specified in VTs, I would concede that
Rule 1504 pretty much means that when a Player authorized to report such an
Infraction does so, e is required (and thus authorized) to submit POs in VTs.

However (you knew that was coming) there is still a problem when we consider
Blots. Penalties expressed in Blots are also regulated by Rule 1435. What are
we to make of these two similar provisions that, in the case of Blots, are
almost identical ? Rule 1504 assigns the authority to execute POs to the
Player making a report of the Infraction. Rule 1435 assigns the same
responsibility to "whomever is required to report the change in Blots".

If these two provision conflict (and to conflict it is sufficient that they
should result in different Players being required to execute the POs) then
Rule 1435 wins by virtue of lower number, and thus I argue that my argument
specific to Rule 1435 applies even in the presence of 1504.

No, you are arguing that the report of the infraction, the execution of a 
Payment Order in Indulgences, and the report of a change in Blots are 
simultaneous, simultaneously required, and equivalent.

In particular, a Player required to report an Infraction becomes, at that time, 
required to submit a PO, *but* 1599 states :

Rule 1599/2 (Power=1)
Failure to Execute Payment Orders

      Whenever a Rule requires a Player execute a Payment Order, e is
      required to do so within seven days.

Thus, whenever an Infraction is reported, the Player who reports it is not
required to simultaneously execute a Payment Order. There is no change in
Blots *until* that is done, and therefore the reporting of an Infraction is not 
synonymous with the reporting of a change in Blots.

Steve> What's your view of Xanadu's registration? It was accepted at

I have expounded at some length on this issue already.  My position
may not be particularily pleasing to other Players, and could prove
most difficult for Judges (who might theoretically have to do research
in multinational law in order to determine the personhood of an
entity), not to mention that an entity's personhood might vary if that
person were to relocate elsewhere in the world (!), but I think it's
most consistent with the way "person" is use elsewhere.  (AFAIK,
informal partnerships such as that enjoyed by Andrew Bishop and Donna
Maron are not fictitious persons in most Western nations, and thus the
registration of Xanadu was most likely improper.)

My point is that the apparent conflict can be resolved by granting
fictitious personhood to Xanadu, an act which is wholly consistent
with legal principles extant in many nations, including all of those
from which Agoran Players arise.  The avatar concept also creates such
a "fictitious person" (calling it an avatar), but also creates many
other fictitious persons who are not needed to resolve any apparent
conflict or for any other purpose, and further does not truly answer
how the Xanadu "avatar" can be reasonably subject to the agency of
more than one natural person.  So I feel that the avatar explanation
is a less favorable approach even if we try to accomodate the Xanadu
experience.

Steve> At any rate, your description of Vlad's view as a deluded
Steve> conceit is unwarranted. 

Well, I tend to think of the claim that Blob is an asexual being as a
"deluded conceit" that I allow Blob out of a spirit of whimsy.
I sincerely doubt that Malcolm is an asexual being, but I grant him
the conceit because it serves no purpose to challenge it.

I have serious problems, beyond the obvious statutory argument with
the plain language in Rule 869, with the avatar theory, the largest of
which is the ambiguity it introduces into the Rules.  The avatar
theory makes the term "Player" equivocal; at times it seems to refer
to the avatar, but at others to the person behind it.  Most
specifically, there are a number of Rules (aside from R.869) that
would be meaningless, absurd, or pointless when interpreted as
regulations on avatar behavior.  Take, for example, Rule 452.  If it
bears solely to Vote Collectors as avatars, then all a Player need do
to evade Rule 452 is take action as himself (and not as his avatar)
and no penalty can befall him because his action as himself was not
regulated.  If you argue that every action taken by a player-person is
also an action by his affiliated avatar, then you have so
substantially identified the the player and the avatar that in my
opinion the theory reduces to one in which there is no distinction.

In short, the avatar theory deeply compromises the ability of the
Rules to regulate player behavior, which is the entire purpose of the
Rules.  I therefore believe that the avatar theory is deeply
incompatible with Nomic, at least with the Nomic practiced in Agora
for the past three-plus years, or with Nomic as elucidated by Peter
Suber.  I do not doubt that avatars could be constructed, but one
would end up with a "dual" code: one set of codes that pertain to
player behavior and one that pertains to avatar behavior.  You cannot
escape the need to regulate real behavior.

I believe that the dual code is is exactly what we see at Shattered
World, which, as I recall, has an encapsulated Nomic which, amongst
other things, was responsible for enacting and enforcing laws
pertaining to behavior within the MUD.  You might ask Geoff about
this; my memory is incredibly vague, and Mike McGaughey and I never
did get along very well.  Vanyel's Platonic/Pragmatic division of the
Rules would also be an example of such a dual code.

One Week ? You must be kidding. Remember, in some instances the Probate Code
forbids an EiP from executing eir duties. Also I think it would be safer to
adopt a name that does not include 'Executor', so as to make the distinction
clear. Further, you will now have to put precedence clauses in there, since I
don't think it's generally possible to submit TOs for an Entity of which one
is not the Executor - check the relevant Rules.

Aack, he said it again!   Good thing I'm not a Player...

I could have *sworn* that last round of that Great Debate I actually
got Scott to agree that regulation of player behavior was *not* in
fact the only thing that the Rules (as they actually exist) do (or
try to do, or have as their purpose, or so on).

The Rules have subsidiary functions, but those functions only exist to
the extent that they further their main function of regulating player
behavior.

I'd even go so far as to state that any Rule which serves in no way to
regulate player behavior is not a rule.

Take that, you eka-platonic weenie! :)

Hrrmm...?

The player/person distinction, according to this Player and this person,
does not exist, in fact, in Agora. It may exist, in fact, in other games.
However, the fact that it exists in other games is not relevant to the
discussion at hand, which is concerned with Agora. It does not exist in
Agora because the rules, which define what exists and does not exist in
Agora (the game, the society, and the mathematical abstraction) to a large
extent, say that a player _is_ a person, not a representation of a person.
Antimatter and Ross Morgan-Linial are one, inseperable being, with two
different names (in Agora). I trust that my point is sufficiently clear.

Ah. But you aren't a Player only when you do things related to Agora,
you're a player *all the time*. Thus, it makes perfect sense that
everything you do is done as a Player, just like everything you do is done
as a human being (I hope). Even if most of what you do has no relevance
whatsoever to Agora.

IOW, 'David Albertz playing the game of Agora' is not an abstraction, it's
another way of saying 'David Albertz (who is a Player of Agora)'. Well,
you *can* consider it an abstraction, if you consider all other statements
of the same form (for example, 'David Albertz eating dinner'). Regardless
of it whether it is an abstraction or not, though, Crito is still a name
for David Albertz, not for 'David Albertz playing the game of Agora'
(which I *think* you agree with, but I'm not sure).

This is actually fascinating, because I was thinking about the use of
Rule 101 again, and have been playing around with the idea that it
helps define what a Rules is (i.e. something that must be obeyed
by all Players), which is close to Scott's conception. Unfortunately,
when you look at the Initial set (all Rules, also by 101), there are
many for which this makes no sense.

  For the record, I am not an adherent of the "avatar theory".
In fact, I am not an adherent of any theory. My point was
to overcome certain theoretical objections. Having failed in
my first attempt, I try again.
  Steve posted a hypothetical stuation in which my posting
"I steal 10 VT's from Morendil" would trigger a Rule that
transferred 10 VT's from Morendil to me.
  Now, many of you have said that I could not do so in the
absence of a specific Rule. Why can I do so in my scenario.
Presumably, because of the Rule. Now, here is my question.

What limitations (if any) are there to the power of the Rules?

It is my opinion that the Rules are constrained to (a) creating
obligations on players to perform or not perform actions and (b)
defining (fictitious) legal structures which are then used to aid in
establishing what the obligations created in (a) are.

I specifically deny that the Rules can grant existence, even in the
abstract, to entities of any sort.  This power inheres in Players.

I am not an "Entitist"; I don't care to think about mathematical
objects dancing around like angels on the head of a pin.  Too
formalistic and divorced from reality for my likes.

The Rules collectively serve to regulate Player behavior.  It would be
a fallacy of composition to assert that, therefore, each individual
Rule must also serve to regulate Player behavior.  Many individual
Rules will not serve any _direct_ purpose of regulating Player
behavior, but will instead lay down limits, conditions, and practices
regarding the interpretation or application of other Rules, as well as
myriad other functions, all of which contribute to the primary
function of regulating player behavior.

You recall incorrectly.  Xanadu, and we who comprise em, live in
Australia.

(Actually, Xanadu hasn't always lived in Australia, even though eir
constituent humans have.  But that's another story.)

On this interpretation, you later write, "...not to mention that an
entity's personhood might vary if that person were to relocate elsewhere
in the world (!), but I think it's most consistent with the way "person"
is use elsewhere."  Now, maybe it's just me, but I fail to see how this is
the "most consistent" interpretation.  But then, I don't believe that the
laws of any nation have _any_ relevence to Agora (why should they?).

And if your view is accepted, and it turns out that Australian law does
not treat Xanadu as a person, what's to stop us (or anyone else) from
claiming that Xanadu resides in X (where X is a country that does treat
Xanadu as a person).  I can carry out business in Y (where Y is (almost)
any country) while I live in Australia, and the business I carry out is
subject to Y's laws.

Okay. So would you be fundamentally (as opposed to practically)
opposed to a system that allowed a Recordkeeper to create/destroy/
redistibute a particular entity at his/her whim, but who was subject
to replacement by vote of the other Players (e.g. if he/she chose not
to follow certain guidelines of fairness, etc.)? Would you say that
such a system was contrary to the principles of Nomic? What about the
Patent Titles Rule?

What, in your opinion, happens when there exists a Rule-like entity
that attempts to exceed the powers mentioned above?

I agree. And since enforcement of the Rules is left solely to the
Players, would you accept the proposition that, in practice at least,
the Rules cannot impel any action the Players cannot?

Let me see if I can make this clearer.  The abstraction I am talking about,
"David playing some game", is the set of all of David's actions that pertain to
the game, as opposed to those actions which do not pertain to the game (but
still may occur *while* the game is being played).  For instance, suppose I am
eating a ham sandwich while I am also playing a game of chess.  The action of
moving one of my chess pieces is a part of the abstraction "David playing a
game of chess".  The action of masticating bits of bread and ham is not a part
of that abstraction.  In Agora, the majority of players take a strictly literal
interpretation of the phrases "a Player is a person..." and "Players must obey
the Rules at all times..." to make *every* action of all players pertain to the
game of Agora.  There is no causal relation between most of your actions and
being a Player in Agora.  You don't breathe *because* you are a player, but the
Rules are interpreted such that you are allowed to breathe without breaking the
Rules only because of R116, which means, as I put it, each breath you take, you
take *as* a player.  What I mean by "taking an action as a player" is "taking
an action that is subject to the rules of the game".
