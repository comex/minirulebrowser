It worries me, however, that in addition to trying to make Proposals to
change Agora into something more "real", you seem to constantly argue that
Agora already is that way. 

In other words, you deny even the possible existence of these abstractions
just because you don't like them.

Incidentally, I like them a lot, and I would probably find Agora too
boring to play without them.

I thought all VTs were wiped out by the Pragmatic Currencies proposal? How
could I possibly have got any?

I did in fact not vote FOR Proposal 3543 because of this.

I don't think the common sense meaning of "person" is anything but
"natural person". Common sense takes precedence over juridical and
commercial custom in Agoran matters. It should be possible for anyone to
play this game without special field knowledge. Except that higher
mathematics is to be encouraged, of course. ;-)

Other than that, I share your disagreement with the avatar theory.

Apparently, someone (Harlequin, I think) put forward an argument that this was
not the case for VTs.  I missed the post somehow, so I never saw what the
argument was - I only saw someone else's referece to it.  However, the recent
court decisions have rendered the point moot anyway, since the judicial
reasoning has concluded that none of the Currencies were ever destroyed.

The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of
a VOC directive was the report published in the PF on 1996/08/13
(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

As far as I know, no Herald's Report has ever been subject to
the adoption of a VOC directive.
