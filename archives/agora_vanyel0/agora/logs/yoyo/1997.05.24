This looks awfully similar to an ASCII map I included with some version or
other of the Agoraverse Proposal.

I certainly didn't copy it, if that's what you're implying. I made this
because I read Steve's report and figured it would be a lot easier to use if
it had a more visual method of presenting the info. I would *not* take
someone else's work and present it as my own.

And, it's rather difficult to make an ASCII map look much different from any
other ASCII map without losing functionality. I mean, what, other than use
line characters, would you suggest I use?

True.  Both our maps happened to have the Origin near the top, but that's
probably just because the Origin is Important.

Also, the Origin is the first on the list of Locations in Steve's report. :)
