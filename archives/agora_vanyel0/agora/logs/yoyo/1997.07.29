I'd say at present that what we have is a bunch of Locations, and that's
it. The relations between them are problematic, but I'd say that Movement
between them in an arbitrary fashion is possible, thanks to R1708. Now,
if R1708 stated that Movement along Paths is possible by sending a message
to the Cartographor, and not possible otherwise, then I'd argue that
the infection of R1707 had made Movement impossible by killing the
definition of Adjacency, and hence the definition of a Path, which
relies on it.

Steve asks:

I'd say it might be the same as it had been before the infection, by virtue
of the last paragraph of Rule 1586:

      When the Rules defining a given Nomic Entity are amended such
      that they still define the Entity but in a different way or with
      different properties, that entity and its properties continue to
      exist to whatever extent is possible under the new definition.

For the time being at least, all mail will dump into the yoyo logs; if
yoyo becomes a relatively permanent solution, I may sort on subject,
although that isn't especially reliable (since people forget sometimes).

So true...  unfortunately, such a thing could not possibly have happened
at a worse time for me, since I'm between jobs, my next paycheck isn't
until September, and I have to scrounge up a rent check within a month.  :(

On the other hand, if we still don't have anything set up by the end of
August, I can see what I can do about setting up lists at brown.edu--the
auxlang and conlang lists operate from there, and they are relatively
high-volume, so once school is back in session I might be able to
convince someone.

Pff.  We'd still be called Agora, we'd just run off the yoyo server.

Making the rules might be fun, acually sending money around the world
might not, I'm afraid. The banks of the global village still are
unbelievably slow and expensive when it comes to sending small amounts
of money to foreign countries. And I don't have a credit card, and
won't get one just to be able to pay Agora fees, either. Well, we
might just snail mail dollar notes, but still I think it would be
better to find a free listserver, even if it's slightly slower.

I agree: arbitrary Movement was possible before the infection, is
possible now, and will still be possible after the disinfection of
R1708. The reason is that R1707 specifies an unrestricted procedure
for Movement ("An Entity Moves when its Executor tells the
Cartographor where it Moves to, given that the Movement is otherwise
permitted by the Rules.") which says nothing about restricting
Movement to available Paths or to Locations less than a certain
Distance away. So, if I tell the Cartographor that I Move to a
certain Location, then I Move there, presumably without occupying
any of the Locations between my current Location and my destination.

The matter of 'fixes' is more subtle. One could add to R1708 a
requirement that Movement must be along Paths, which would at
least require that I occupy each Location along the Path between
my current Location and my destination, but that isn't much of
a restriction: in the current topography of Locations, every
Location is accessible from every other Location in a finite
number of Moves, so it's not as if I won't be able, after the
amendment, to reach any destination that arbitrary Movement would
have allowed me to reach. I'd just have to explicitly Move to
each Location on the Path to my destination. Most Players seem
to be doing that anyway, even though it's not necessary. That's
not meant to be an argument against such an amendment; I guess
it makes me wonder whether arbitrary Movement is such a problem
that it needs to be fixed. The difference this amendment *would*
make, as I pointed out in another post, is that if R1707 were
infected again, then I think Movement would no longer be possible,
since without R1707, we have no concept of Adjacency, and hence
no concept of a Path.

A stronger restriction on Movement would be to limit the Distance
any Entity could travel in a Nomic Week - but that would be a
significant change to the current framework. Some Players might
not be able to reach the Stasis Chamber in time for them to go
On Hold as they would wish, which would be unfortunate, IMO.

Herald's Report as of 28 July, 1997

I'm sending this to the backup list.  How do I get mail from there?

Note:  As far as I can tell from my reading of the Rules, Elde still does not
have an Executor in Probate, and as of eir deregistration on 25 July, Elde has
no Executor.  All of eir Payment Orders are still outstanding.

Note:  The dates recorded for the Payment Orders of Blob and elJefe which
resulted from their Failures to Judge are based on the time the Infraction was
reported, not on the time Michael issued an explicit PO.

The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of
a VOC directive was the report published in the PF on 1996/08/13
(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

As far as I know, no Herald's Report has ever been subject to
the adoption of a VOC directive.

You've lost me here. What would the property "being the same Player
as I was previously" mean, in practical terms ? I am a person, and
I am at all times the same person - when I become a Player, that is,
when the NP 'Player' is granted to me by the Rules, I will become
the same "person with the 'Player' Property affixed to em" as I
was at any other time that I had the property of being a Player.
Rule 1432 is entirely useless under the new paradigm.

Oh, that was different - the Titles themselves had ceased to exist,
no question of that - it's only that the Rules required (still require,
last time I looked) the Registrar to keep track of _historical_, not
just _current_, events. Same if the Chancellor was required to keep
track of past Currencies - e'd have to list Points although they
definitely no longer exist.

The general case is what is of interest here, though. If we are to
preserve the notion that "A Player is a registered person" and "Players
are Voting Entities" together mean that when you deregister you are
no longer allowed to Vote, which I agree is desirable, _and_ fit that
into an interpretative framework where Entities are irrelevant and
Properties are all-important (even prior to enacting legislation to
clarify this interpretation) then we need to know how to consistently
interpret "An X is an Y" in the various contexts in which it appears.
All occurences of "is" or "are" won't have the same meaning but we
at least need guidelines to determine if it means "an entity has the 
property of X-ness if and only if it is an Y" or something weaker.

I await your comments on Executors in Probate, terminal estates and
all that stuff with eager anticipation.

(P.S. could you add the DIS: BUS: and OFF: tags manually to your
Subject: headers ? I makes life so much easier for my mail sorting
function...)

In eir judgement of CFJ 929 elJefe states that "Indulgences ceased to
exist as a Currency by Rule 1579" - yet they are listed in the latest
Herald's report. Something (or someone) is wrong here. Because of this
I would like to state that the Herald's report is in error, listing
players to own currency that doesn't even exist.

Since the statement of CFJ 929 had nothing to do with Indulgences, elJefe's
comments about Indulgences do not have any force, until a CFJ dealing
directly with the existence or non-existence of Indulgences or P-Notes is
judged.

True. My comments do not trigger the non-existence of Indulgences. That
happened (if it did) well before I took legal notice of it.  Naturally I
hope the Herald in deciding the COE will be convinced by the arguments
listed.  A CFJ may be necessary, or it may not.

They do not have any *direct* legal force--but they seem valid, and
you have not demonstrated any reason why they are wrong.
In other words, his reasons have as much legal force as they have
logic, inasmuch as logic is a meta-game principle.

I was not arguing against elJefe's position (I think he's probably right,
in fact). I was merely stating that elJefe's judgement of CFJ 929 does not
set in stone that Indulgences do not exist in the same way that a TRUE
verdict on a CFJ with the statement "There is no Currency called
Indulgences" would.

The Locations still exist - well, at least the Origin still exists.
As far as I can tell, and I've searched the Rules pretty carefully,
no other Locations actually exist, nor have they for some time. 
Perhaps they never existed, I don't know. But that's a different
issue. Let's say there were a bunch of Locations, whose Positions
with respect to each other were defined in terms of Adjacency. Then,
the Adjacency Rule catches the Virus and goes out of action for 2
weeks. What happens?

I say: we're left with a bunch of Locations, none of which are any
longer connected by Paths of Adjacency. What other sense can we
make of the Viral sentence's declaration that "this Rule [the
Adjacency Rule]...shall be completely without effect."? I arrive
at this conclusion precisely by applying R1586. Locations are still
defined, but with different properties - specifically, they have lost
the property of being Adjacent to each other. They cannot continue
to have that property, since that would conflict with the Adjacency
Rule as amended by the Virus.

Rehi all,

Forgive my e-mail illiteracy, but I seem to have missed some significant
communications since the list crash and prior to my getting subscribed to the
backup list.  I'll try to find things from the archives, but it might be safer
if the authors of messages pertaining to the Herald (or apparently the
Promotor) could forward a copy of those messages to me.

Thanks,

I'm still not sure exactly what a terminal estate is. Perhaps Scott
can enlighten us. At any rate, I'm going to try to defer discussion
of that awkward matter again, because I think I've found another
possible objection to your attempted registration of Elde. I say
'possible' because, although I feel I've identified an important
question, I don't know how to answer it.

I concede, but only for the sake of argument, that you are Elde's Executor
in Probate. R1738 states:

      The Executor in Probate of an entity is the Executor of that
      entity, and empowered only to submit Transfers Orders for that
      entity.  An Executor in Probate also has the power to execute
      and vacate certain Payment Orders, as specified by the Probate
      Code.  This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which
      would specify a different Executor for an entity in Probate.

According to R1738, then, your powers as Elde's Executor are strictly
limited to the submission of Transfer Orders, and the execution and
vacation of Payment Orders. They certainly do not extend to
registration. Now, doubtless you will claim that your registration
of Elde is performed under the auspices of R1478:

      The Executor of an entity is a Player who is empowered by the
      Rules to act on behalf of that entity, as if e was that entity.

Question: are Rules 1478 and 1738 in conflict concerning your
authority to register on behalf of Elde? It depends on what reading
one gives of R1478. On one reading, doubtless the one you defend, R1478 
grants you the power to do whatever Derek Lyons could do, as if you
were him. On that reading, R1478 says that you can, while R1738 says
that you cannot, register as Elde on Derek's behalf. The two Rules
would therefore conflict, a conflict which R1478 would win in virtue
of its lower Number. (The precedence clause in R1738 does not apply;
R1478 does not specify a different Executor for Derek Lyons.)

But the reading on which the two Rules conflict is not forced. There
is another reading, according to which the two Rules actually
cooperate. On this reading, R1478 states that, as Derek's Executor,
you are empowered to act on his behalf as if you were him, but
remains silent on the extent of this power. R1738 establishes that as
Derek's Executor in Probate, you are his Executor, and places limits
on your authority to act as if you were him.

This, then, is the crucial question, on which I think the Courts will
have to rule: does R1478 explicitly grant you *unlimited* power to
act on behalf of Derek Lyons while you are his Executor, or does
it grant you that power while remaining silent as to its extent? If
the former view is taken, Rules 1478 and 1738 are in conflict, as
R1738 clearly seeks to limit your power as Executor. If the latter
view is taken, there is no conflict, as R1738 merely speaks where
R1478 is silent.
