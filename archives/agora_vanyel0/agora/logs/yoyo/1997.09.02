You are perfectly entitled to this point of view, and as far as I am concerned
it is supported by the language in 1693. However, your reading of 'correct' as
'reached consistently with the Rules' is overrestrictive. Agora's Board of
Appeal is its highest jurisdiction and has been repeatedly called upon by
Players to resolve matters in which the Rules were "silent, inconsistent, or
unclear".

In all such cases the doctrine which you are promoting should have led the
higher Court to uphold any Judgement that was not inconsistent with the Rules. 
Take a look at, for instance, the final case-sheet of 921 to see that this is 
plainly not the custom in Agora.

In the current instance, there are points of interpretations where Steve's
Judgement leaves several issues unresolved, and consequently where it is
unclear that this Judgement is correct; I pointed these out, you failed to
adress them.

Rule 1435 takes precedence over 1504 in the case of a conflict, which there is
if the specifications of the two Rules point to different Players for the same
duty.

Try audiotool, and check out the "Record..." option in the "Volume" menu.

Also, you might try /usr/demo/SOUND/bin/soundtool

I'll look into the windex problems for /usr/openwin/man.

But you seem to be arguing that Rule 1435 fails to specify anyone, so
there is no conflict.

Is someone on hold liable for this?  If so it is extremely unfair, since
I am on hold because I don't have time to keep track of this kind of
little crap.  (I'm getting married)  I thought I wasn't under any obligations.
Something seems broken.

I am indeed arguing that - and I argue that a conflict results with
1504. One might say that Rule 1020 fails to specify a Player who is
to execute Indulgence POs, and I would agree that there is therefore
no conflict between 1020 and 1504.

However, Rule 1435 presents a speficic procedure for determining which
Player is authorized to execute Indulgence POs. For the reasons I
explained in my arguments in 937, I believe that this procedure does
not identify a Player at all. However, this failure to result in a
valid specification would not, IMHO, result in 1435's being silent
on the issue. Insofar as applying the procedures set out in 1504
and 1435 results in different conclusions, there is a conflict,
which 1435 wins.

I'm going to take what may be a somewhat controversial
position here--and this may have already been brought up,
because this is the first time I'm reading email in
a few days, and I haven't read all the messages yet.

I would submit that IN Rule 101 is meaningless, as nomics
do not have free will.  Their players have free will
(or I assume they do for the sake of this argument),
which translates into a nomic having virtually unlimited
capability to change itself, but the actions of a nomic
are deterministic, given its Rules and the free actions
of its players.  IN R101, however, attempts to require
actions of the nomics themselves, and not of their players.
To require obedience of something that does not have free will
is ineffective, at best, and more likely entirely meaningless.

This is a perfectly valid reductionist viewpoint.  However, I don't
like it all that much. :)

There is another, more holistic, viewpoint.  In politics it is common
to speak of "the will of the people" or "the will of Congress" or "the
will of the Legislature".  Under the interpretation Chuck sets forth
above, it is meaningless to speak of these things.  But, nonetheless,
we do.  I submit that corporate entities such as a nation, or a Nomic
_do_ have a will.  A will constrained by those of the people who make
it up, to be certain, but a will nonetheless.  It is, for example, the
will of the people of the United States that Timothy McVey be put to
death for his crimes, just as it is the will of the Players of Agora
that Peter Suber be declared a Hero.  Perhaps this is merely a
convenient abstraction, but I tend to think there is more to it than
that.

As to the ability to place obligations placed on corporatist entities,
I believe such obligations "pass through" to the entities comprising
the corporate entity.  If, say, an American Airlines airplane crashes
on my house, and I get an order from a court ordering American
Airlines to repair my house, that obligation, placed nominally upon
the corporate American Airlines is transmitted through the corporate
structure to individuals within American Airlines, who must then, in
order to fulfill that obligation, perform the repairs to my house (or,
more likely, further pass that obligation on to others outside the
corporate structure by executing contracts).

In short, I think that the above-mentioned passthrough of obligations
is a necessary part of the Game Contract underlying the Rules.
