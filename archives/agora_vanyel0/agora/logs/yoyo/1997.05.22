Yes, they're in conflict. The Frankenstein Rule defines what a Vote is - the 
name of a Candidate for the given Frankenstein Monster. R683 steps in and 
overrules that, saying that none of those are really votes, since they are not 
FOR, AGAINST, ABSTAIN, or an obvious synonym of one of those. Thus, the set of 
legal Votes, defined by the Frankenstein Rule, is reduced to an empty set. 
Poof, no voting. The precedence conflict is there - not over whether FOR, 
AGAINST, ABSTAIN are votes (R683 doesn't say they are, the Frankenstein Rule 
says they aren't), but over whether the things defined as Votes by the 
Frankenstein Rule are votes (The Frankenstein Rule says they are, R683 says 
they aren't, so they aren't). So, while yes, R683 takes precedence, there are 
still no legal Votes (unless someone finds a hole in my argument (I can't see 
one, but still... (am I using too many nested parenthasis? (yes)))).

You have the power of negation.

If the upshot of this amendment to the Frankenstein Rule is to make it
impossible to cast a Vote, then 114 steps in and prevents the amendment.
We can, therefore, still Vote, though we might need a CFJ to determine
whether the Frankenstein Rule was amended or not.
