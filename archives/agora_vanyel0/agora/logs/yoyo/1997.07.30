Well, CFJ 930 has now been Judged. But I don't know if the dispute
has been resolved. Given Eljefe's reasoning (and Chuck's support
of it), are you now prepared to accept that PC-POs are distinct from
MMM-POs?

Er, excuse me, but...can anyone show me that such Locations as the
Beer Hall and the Welcoming Center actually exist?

Take the Welcoming Center. The only reference to it in the Rules
is in Rule 869, where it is stated that Players are Located
there upon their registration. Nowhere in the Rules does it
say that "there is a Location named the Welcoming Center". (cf
R1706: "There is a Location named the Origin.") Nor can I find
anywhere in the Rules provisions which would grant the Cartographor
or any other Player, the power to bring Locations into existence,
for instance by announcing their existence in the Public Forum.
The Cartographor has the power to rename Locations "not specifically
mentioned by name in the Rules" (R1706), but as far as I can tell,
there are no such Locations. The only Location which actually exists
as far as I can tell is the Origin. The Welcoming Center, the Beer
Hall and the University are all mentioned by name, but none are
said to exist. As to all the other so-called Locations, such as the
Archivist's Office, where did they come from? Have we lost an
important Rule somewhere along the line?

I hereby rename the currencies created by Morendil on behalf of the

follows:

Old name                         New name

Remark

"Wait, you can't do that! These names are a Nomic Property (NP) of
these currencies and protected by 1011!"

No, they are not. What _is_ an NP is the fact that they do have a
name, i.e. are not nameless. This is explicitly required in 1576, and
not changed by changing the names.

But the particular names were given in a message to the public forum
(unlike the names of rule-defined currencies like VTs, which are given
in the relevant rules). So they are not Nomic Properties, after all,
and not protected by 1011.

I'm sure these POs will remain disputed for some time - pending COEs
and future CFJs regarding Indulgences will probably see to that. As
to that last question - I'm not sure yet, but probably.

Oh, neat argument. :)

I won't attempt to set forth an answer yet; for the moment I'll just
submit some observations.

The first is that your suggestion amounts to reading the relevant
provision of 1478 as "The Executor of an entity is a Player who
is empowered by the Rules to act on behalf of that entity, as
if e was that entity, unless otherwise restricted by the Rules."
At least I think you'll agree that if 1478 did have this qualifying
clause we would have precisely the situation you describe, that is,
1478 and 1738 could not come into conflict but would rather be
cooperating to define the extent of an EiP's authority to act on
the behalf of the Entity e represents.

Another, unrelated observation is that 1478 states "as if e was that
entity". Taken literally, this clause does seem to establish a legal
equivalence between an Executor and the Entity e represents; and
if it was the case that an Executor could _not_ perform any action
that that Entity can perform, then that identity would not hold -
e would _not_ in fact be "empowered [...] to act [...] as if e was
that entity". IOW, I would interpret this "as if" to define the
extent to which an Executor can act on behalf of another Entity,
and conclude that 1478 is not silent on this matter.

Lastly, if Rule 1478 is in fact silent on the extent of that
authority, we might ponder how it is that an Executor of an Entity
is indeed empowered to perform various acts on behalf of that
Entity. An Executor's authority to do so would have to be a Nomic
Property of the Executor - and it seems to me that in that case
1011 would prevent Rule 1478 from giving Executors any effective
authority, unless 1478 is not silent on the extent of that
authority.

Sadly, I'll be away on vacations for two weeks starting Friday, so
I'll probably miss a lot of interesting debate. :(

One issue coming up about the Probate code will need to be fixed - the
penalties for Persistent Indebtedness are assessed against the Executor
of the Entity which is in Debt. This means that if an Executor in Probate
is designated for a Player who was in Debt before deregistering, then
_that_ Player - rather than the actual debitor - will be subject to those 
penalties. Making an enemy of the Notary is definitely not a good idea. :)

Myself, I'm not overly concerned - Elde only had Indulgence Debts, so
if Indulgences don't exist I'm not at risk. Even if they are, there's a chance
I'll be back before the dust has settled and the relevant POs are no longer
disputed.

      Each Recordkeepor shall maintain a record of all Payment Orders

  Published, as of this message

======================================================================

Judgement: FALSE

Reasons and arguments:

1586 defines a Nomic Entity (NE) as

      A "Nomic Entity" is any entity which has no discernible
      existence without the Rules, only existing by virtue of the
      Rules defining it to exist.

It does not matter whether the _creation_ of an entity depends on
other factors than rules only (the creation of the currency "Payment
Orders" depended on a message to the public forum by Morendil, in
addition to the relevant rules).

It does matter, however, whether the possible _destruction_ of an
entity depends only on rules. The currency "Payment Orders" can be
destroyed at any time at its mintor's whim (1722), and it will be
automatically destroyed when the mintor ceases to exist or ceases to
have mint authority (1579). So it is not true that the currency
"Payment Orders" _only_ exists by virtue of the rules defining it to
exist as required in the definition of an NE.

To back up this interpretation of the NE definition I would like to
point out that the rules call four entities "NEs" explicitly in the
rule defining the entity: The Virus (1454), Theses (1369), the Bank
(1470) and the Frankenstein Monster (1671). No rule contains explicit
provisions for the destruction of these entities by any means. So the
only way they can be destroyed is via repeal (or other sufficient
changes of) the rules defining these NEs. This is what "only existing
by virtue of the Rules defining it to exist" means.

--
Footnote, concerning an argument raised by the caller of this CFJ.

This may seem to create a contradictory situation: "Currencies in
general only exist because of rules defining them, thus they are
NEs. Particular currencies not created by the rules, but by other
entities with mint authority, are not NEs according to this
judgement."

I agree that there is a contradiction. In terms of entity classes this
means that the overall class of "currencies" is an NE, while some
members of this class (non-rule defined particular currencies) are not
NEs and others (rule-defined currencies) are.

However, I think this contradiction does not ivalidate my arguments;
rather it shows another weakness of the current NE system that
deserves attention in any future NE reform.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

I've given my arguments all over n-d, so I won't repeat any of them
here.  The relevant Rules are: 1467, 1591, 1586.

I see from the archives that I have become
promotor.

H. Assessor, it is my intention to distribute
proposals weekly (when there are any) on a
consistent day of the week, except for emergency
proposals.  Since this would force you to complete
the assessment on a particular day of the week, I
thought I would let you pick the day that is most
convenient for you.  If you have no preference, I
will begin distributing proposals regularly on
Monday, the beginning of the Nomic Week.

Also, AFAICT, there is only one outstanding
proposal that is waiting to be distributed.  The
one from Swann that I found in the archives.  H.
Former Promotor, please forward to me any other
undistributed proposals that I may be missing.

Also I seem to be missing a whole slew of
proposals that have already been distributed
(noted from Morendil's reference to 3541).  Could
you please let me know the last proposal number
used.

Thanks and Regards,
Promotor Crito

OFF: Herald's Report as of 28 July, 1997

It seems that I am forced into the position of Judge without actually having a
CFJ assigned to me.  8)

First, regarding Kolja's Claim of Error - I admit this claim, but not in the
way expected.  I agree that the Indulgences which were in existence prior to
PC were destroyed by the lack of a Mintor and that the Chancellor did not have
the authority to create new Indulgences which could then be transferred to
Elde.  Therefore I agree with elJefe's judgement on CFJ 929,  since there were
no Indulgences in the bank to be distributed at that time, making the PO and
TO associated with that transaction invalid.

However, I disagree that the currency Indulgences cease to exist.  R1435
clearly states, "Indulgences are a Currency".  Even though R1579 claims that
any Currency that does not have a Mintor ceases to exist, it looses out on
that claim because of precedence.  IMO, it was not in conflict with R1435 in
declaring the destruction of specific instances of Indulgences, however it is
in conflict with R1435 in declaring that the currency itself does not exist. 
Therefore, Indulgences *are* still a currency as stated by R1435 and hence
there can be POs issued for them.  Of course, there are currently no
Indulgences in existence and no way to mint them, so there is no way to
execute any TOs for Indulgences.

*** Note:  Based on this, I hereby call for the appeal of CFJ 930. ***

I hereby vacate the PO issued on Mon, 21 July 1997 10:37:00 (EDT) for 1
Indulgence from the Bank to Vanyel.  (IMO, I do not have to wait for
resolution of a disputed PO before I can vacate it.)

Chancellor and Vanyel take note, the TO for the above mentioned PO, of course
was also invalid and was not successfully executed.

Also, since CFJs have called Indulgence POs into dispute, there can be no
Persistent Indebtedness based on them (lucky for Morendil, elJefe, and Blob).

The corrected Herald's Report (until the next COE/CFJ) follows:

Anyone know anyone at teleport?

I suppose one of us could possibly get an account at teleport,
if enough people are willing to pay.  A basic account is $12/month,
slightly less if you pay for 3 months or more at a time.  It's
limited to 30 hours/month, but that should be plenty just for
maintaining the lists.  I'd be willing to pay for some of it,
say $3-4 per month.

Any other options?  Did anyone else have the capability to set up
lists?  (dfw.net doesn't have majordomo or anything similar running.)
I know Steve said he could, but I tend to agree that we need a
backup list on a different machine (and, preferably, maintained by
a different person) than the main lists.

Hi all! Good to see that you have managed to keep this Game in a stable
state of Crisis without my help.

Well, my vacation is over, so I'll attempt to get out of this cold
Chamber. What do you mean, we are in quarantine? A Virus attack?

Fortunately, I have this Acme (TM) Teleport and Time Travel Loophole. I
hereby crawl through it into the Beer Hall.

Too bad it has this side effect of retroactively disconnecting Agora from
other Teleports. I hope we didn't have any lying around... Uh oh. It seems
like we did.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

In any case, yoyo's ongoing bizarre behaviour (messages regularly
delayed for long periods and appearing out of order) in my opinion
makes it unsuitable as a long term location for the lists.

Is anyone else getting multiple copies of messages? I seem to be getting
most messages at least twice, maybe 3 or 4 or even more times. I've just
logged to find copies of every message that has been sent to the backup
list since July 26 sitting in my mailbox. There's nothing in the headers
to indicate that I'm getting these messages because I'm the list admin.

Does anyone else share my discomfort at this method of creating
Locations?  In the first place, it's not clear to me that the creation
of ongoing entities can work in this fashion. Still, we have the
precedent of Patent Titles, so maybe my worries on that score are
unfounded. I'd be happier, though, if matters were arranged so that
the Cartographor could create Locations Without Objection. But
there's more to come: it seems to me that the Locations thus defined
are not Nomic Entities, which arguably they ought to be, nor do they
have any Nomic Properties, which certainly they ought to have.
