I think that quite clearly means that all member nomics must abide by IN's
rules.  The rule proposal in question was to add a rule to AckaNomic's
ruleset.  I would think that AckaNomic now has to add the rule to eir
ruleset, or else must decide to leave IN.  If ey don't decide to leave IN,
then the rule is caused to be added to eir ruleset by the IN.

I think the question in this case should be: what needs to happen to leave
the IN?  Is it a vote of all the members of the member nomic?

This, is, to put it bluntly, a denial of justice. In my statement announcing 
the appeal of this Judgement, I pointed out at least two specific issues of 
interpretation of the Rules, both of which potentially crippling to Steve's 
arguments, one of which I specifically stated required the attention of 
Appellate Judges.

I am entirely disgusted at this summary dismissal of specific arguments, which 
I would find irresponsible even of a Judge, far more of a Justice in an Appeal.

And _this_ adds insult to injury - by further muddying the waters with what
is clearly circular reasoning. To be sure, executing a PO in Indulgences both
causes *and* reports a change in Blots - but then, the crux of the whole
debate is precisely that sentence in 1435 that identifies "whomever is
required to report the change in Blots" as the Player authorized to submit
such POs. Unless another, valid designation also authorizes some Player to
submit such PCs the above argument sheds no more light on the Statement at
hand, which is precisely a specific claim that there is no Player so
authorized.

The reason why I failed to disturb Steve's Judgement is that I felt
that it was properly made.  In my opinion, there are several possibly
correct Judgements in this case.  Your arguments may well have
supported some alternative Judgement.  However, as an appellate
Justice it is not my duty to determine what the most correct Judgement
is, but to determine if the trial Judgement is correct.  Since I feel
that Steve's Judgement was reached consistently with the Rules, it
would have been an abuse of appellate discretion on my part to disturb
his Judgement.

As to your second argument, I believe there is already language (in
Rule 1504/5) which specifies who is to report Indulgence P/Os related
to Infractions ("the Player making the report of the Infraction shall
execute whatever Payment Order(s) are required to apply the penalty
specified for that Infraction").  Hence your counterargument is
mooted, by your own admission.

My Judgement stands.
