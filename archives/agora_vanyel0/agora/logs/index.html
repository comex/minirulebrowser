<h1>Listservers</h1>
Since Agora is a Play-By-Email game, everything we do has to go by
email.  Because there is so much Agora-related traffic, we have three
main listservers to use, and one backup.  The "Public Forum", which all
Players are required to receive, consists of agora-official,
agora-business, and yoyo and tue (the backup servers).  Subscription to
agora-discussion is optional but recommended.
<p>
As Archivist, I have more-or-less complete logs of all the servers
dating back to the game's inception.  The most recent week or two is
kept available through these pages; older than that, you'll have to
email me.
