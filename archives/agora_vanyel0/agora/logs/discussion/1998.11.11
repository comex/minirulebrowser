What about debts owed by or to such entities?

Yes:  let the Notary do anything e likes with the assets of the
entities in Probate, as long as the entity ends up with no assets.

No.  Send me another copy of the latest proto and I'll look.

What about them? Require the Notary (or the relevant Recordkeepor) to
vacate any Payment Order that names the entity as payor or payee. That's
essentially what happens now anyway. We can keep Fugitive Blots. But,
please, get rid of Wills and the Probate Code and Probate Plans and the
whole Executor in Probate mess - the complications introduced by them
just aren't worth whatever minimal extra functionality they provide.

Well, exactly. In some ways, I prefer this suggestion to my own, of
requiring the Notary to return assets to the Bank - because it makes
being the Notary a little more attractive, which the Office has rarely
been. (There was a brief moment during the Zombie crisis when being the
Notary was important.) But either way, I reckon that Rules 1601, 1637,
1738, 1739 and 1757, which total about 200 lines in the SLR, could all
quite happily go with no-one the worse for it.

Unfortunately, your plan, while blatantly obvious, is not very cunning.
There are 100 Plots in existence. Rule 1844 (Winning by Ownership),
states that:

      If at least one-third of all Plots are not owned by the Bank,
         ---------------------------------------------------------
      and all Plots not owned by the Bank are owned by a single
      entity, then that entity's Executor satisfies a Win Condition
      known as a Win by Monopoly. [emphasis added]

This means that no-one may Win by Monopoly until 34 Plots are not owned
by the Bank.

What does "without prejudice" mean? I notice that the term is already
used by R1562, but is not defined anywhere in the Rules. Does adding
this sentence at end of paragraph (d) actually add anything extra to the
Rule? As far as I can tell, the Rule will work just as well without it.

I think you're quite right to point this out, and I agree with you that
Michael's transfer is invalid for the reasons you give. Pretty clearly,
the purpose of R1478 is to require Michael to say something like "As
Executor of the X Group, I hereby transfer 1 Indulgence from the X Group
the Bank to satisfy POI058." This is not just nitpickiness. The purpose
is relieve the Recordkeepor of the responsibility of checking to see
whether the person making the transfer is authorized to do so.

So you really aren't interested in having a viable private economy.
Righto.  Let's just repeal the entire currency system, then.

I like it, except that as the rules currently stand, people ineligible
to judge a CFJ can't be Justice on an appeal of that CFJ either (see
R911).  I'd recommend that you insert some language exempting the
usual Board from this restriction as far as selection for Appeals
goes.

Protoproposal Chaos56 [rev. 11]

Currencies

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1721 be amended to read:

      There shall exist the Office of Chancellor.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1467 be amended to read:

      (a) A Currency is any medium of exchange which has designated as
          a Currency in accordance with the Rules.

      (b) The designation of a medium of exchange as a Currency, and
          the cancellation of such designation, may be accomplished
          only by:
        (1) the operation of an Instrument with Power 1 or greater;
        (2) the Chancellor, Without Objection; or
        (3) Judicial Order, whenever the Rules so permit.

      (c) For the purposes of the Rules, units of a Currency are
          fungible and indivisible.

      (d) A Currency may be denominated such that a fraction of its
          primary denomination is its smallest indivisible unit, so
          long as there is a smallest indivisible unit. When no other
          specification exists, the smallest indivisible unit of a
          Currency shall be one unit of its smallest denomination.
          Amounts less than this smallest indivisible unit may be used
          in intermediate calculations; all such calculations shall be
          rounded off at the point that they are reduced to transfers,
          orders to transfer, or other finalized results of legal
          import.

      (e) The Chancellor shall retain and published at least monthly a
          schedule, listing every medium of exchange designated as a
          Currency under this Rule. This schedule shall include
          whatever information the Chancellor deems necessary, but at
          least the following information:
        (1) For each Currency, the designated denomination or
            denominations of that Currency (and if more than one, the
            relationship between them) and the fraction of the
            smallest such denomination which is the smallest
            indivisible unit; and
        (2) For each intangible Currency, the Recordkeepor and, if
            any, the Mintor or Mintors of that Currency.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) A Currency, the units of which have no tangible existence,
          is known as an "intangible Currency". The "Recordkeeper" of
          an intangible Currency refers to the entity who has agreed
          to maintain a record of the ownership of the units of that
          Currency. The Recordkeepor of an intangible Currency is
          subject to the jurisdiction of these Rules. Specifically, e
          shall:
        (1) maintain the abovementioned records in a manner consistent
            with these Rules, including the timely recordation of
            transfers of ownership made consistent with the Rules;
        (2) comply in a timely manner to all requests to produce those
            records as required by the Rules; and
        (3) perform all other duties which the Rules impose upon the
            Recordkeepor of an intangible Currency.

      (b) An intangible Currency may have any number of designated
          Mintors. A Mintor may be designated for a Currency, or such
          designated cancelled, by:
        (1) the operation of an Instrument with Power 1 or greater; or
        (2) the Chancellor, Without Objection.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1598 be amended to read:

      Units of an intangible Currency are transferred only when the
      Recordkeepor of that Currency receives a notice from the owner
      of one or more units of that Currency, specifying the units to
      be transferred and the entity who is to owner the units thus
      transferred. The entity receiving the units thus transferred
      becomes their owner, and the Recordkeepor shall so note this on
      eir records.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1471 be amended to read:

      (a) Any entity who, without authorization, creates units of a
          tangible Currency commits the Class B Crime of
          Counterfeiting.

      (b) Units of an intangible Currency are created only when the
          Recordkeepor of that Currency receives a notice from a
          designated Mintor of that Currency, specifying the number of
          units to be created and the entity who is to own the units
          so created. The specified entity owns the units so created,
          and the Recordkeepor shall so note this on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Any entity who, without authorization, destroys units of
          Currency which e does not own is indebted to the owner of
          those units of Currency for the amount thus destroyed.

      (b) Units of an intangible Currency are destroyed only when the
          Recordkeepor of that Currency receives a notice from the
          owner of one or more units of that Currency, specifying the
          units to be destroyed. The Recordkeepor shall note this
          destruction on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1596 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever an entity becomes indebted to another for some
          amount of Currency, that entity indebted is required to
          transfer that amount of Currency to the entity indebted to
          within seven days.

      (b) A debt not paid within seven days is overdue. Any entity to
          whom an overdue debt is due may assess a late penalty of not
          more than 25% of the overdue debt, and may do so repeatedly,
          not more than once every seven days after the debt becomes
          overdue. Late penalties are added to the overdue debt. An
          entity may elect to charge smaller late penalties, charge
          them less frequently, or forego late penalties altogether,
          at that entity's sole discretion.

      (c) If the validity of a debt, or any part thereof, is disputed
          by a Call for Judgement, that debt (or portion thereof) is
          not considered overdue, and does not accrue late penalties,
          while the dispute remains unsettled.

      (d) When an entity transfers units of Currency to another entity
          for the purpose of making a payment on debt, the receiving
          entity shall apply that payment to the nondisputed debts
          owed to em by the transferring entity, in order from oldest
          to newest. A debt is paid when a transfer has been applied
          to it in this manner. Any surplus will be retained by the
          receiving entity, to be applied to future debts or returned
          upon demand.

      (e) An entity may assume that any Currencies transferred to it
          to be payments on debts due to em, unless the transferree
          clearly indicates otherwise when making the transfer.

      (f) An entity who is owed an overdue debt may issue an Order
          requiring the entity who owes that debt to make payment by
          requiring a transfer of any amount up to the amount of the
          debt due, but only if no other Order currently in force
          requires the same entity to make payment on that same debt
          or any part thereof. Such an Order shall be stayed (by the
          Clerk of the Courts) if the debt in question is subsequently
          disputed, and vacated (by the Judge) if it is found that the
          debt upon which the Order is based is invalid.

      (g) An entity who is owed a debt may cancel all or part of that
          debt at any time.

      (h) A Judge may enjoin the assessment of late penalties,
          restrict the amount of late penalties, or require the
          reduction or cancellation of a debt, by Judicial Order, when
          the Rules specifically so allow.

          execute a Notice of Debt for the given amount with that
          entity as payee and the Bank as payor.

      (b) Whenever a Rule calls for an Officer to bill an entity for
          some quantity of Currency, that Officer shall execute a
          Notice of Debt for the given amount with that entity as
          payor and the Bank as payee.

      (c) A Notice of Debt is executed by announcing in the Public
          Forum that the payor is indebted to the payee for the amount
          indicated, so long as the announcement sets for the reason
          therefore.

      (d) The lawful execution of a Notice of Debt causes the payor
          noted therein to be indebted to the payee noted therein for
          the amount noted therein, but only if the executor of the
          Notice of Debt was authorized to execute it, and the reason

            person empowered by the Rules to execute transfers on the
            behalf of the transferring entity;
        (2) the notice clearly sets forth the quantity to be
            transferred in a form such that the Recordkeepor can
            easily and definitively determine the amount being
            transferred;
        (3) the entity to receive the transfer is specified with
            sufficient clarity that a reasonable person in the
            Recordkeepor's position would know to which entity the
            transferring entity refers; and
        (4) the transfer is for an amount not more than the current
            holdings of the transferring entity.

      (b) Transfers shall be noted on the Recordkeepor's records in
          the order in which they are received by the Recordkeepor.

      (c) When a Recordkeepor records a transfer, e shall promptly

          been recorded, unless it appears to the Recordkeepor that
          the recipient is already aware of the transfer.

      (d) When a Recordkeepor elects not to record a transfer for the
          reason that the transfer is not in conformance with any part
          of subdivision (a) of this Rule, e shall promptly inform
          both the transferrer and the recipient that the transfer has
          not be recorded, and give the reason therefor. (If the
          reason for failure to record is that the recipient was not
          clearly specified, there is no duty to inform the
          recipient.)

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1696 be amended to read:

      (a) Voting Tokens are hereby designated as an intangible
|         Currency.  The sole designated Mintor of Voting Tokens is
|         the Bank.  The Recordkeepor of Voting Tokens is irrevocably
          designated to be the Accountor. The smallest indivisible

          the Herald.

      (b) The Herald constructively agrees to act as Recordkeepor for
          Indulgences by accepting the Office.

      (c) An entity which owes a debt (or debts) to the Bank for any
          number of Indulgences is said to have that number of Blots.
          A Player has Blots equal to the sum of all such debts. Debts
          which are in dispute are still considered when determining
          how many Blots a Player has.

      (d) When a Rule states that a Player is to gain some number of
          Blots, a Notice of Debt shall be executed for the same
          number of Indulgences, naming that Player as the payor and
          the Bank as payee; this order shall be executed by whomever
          the Rules require to report the change in Blots.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1738 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever there is an entity in Probate which does not have a
          Trustee, the Notary shall nominate a Player to be that
          entity's Trustee. E shall announce this appointment in the
          Public Forum.

      (b) As soon as possible after the Notary announces the
          appointment of a Trustee for an entity in Probate, the
          following records shall be provided to the Trustee:
        (1) by the Recordkeepor of each Currency, an accounting of the
            number of units of that Currency held by the entity in
            Probate; and
        (2) by the Notary, any Will of the entity in Probate which has
            been filed with the Notary.

      (c) In the event that the Trustee does not receive any part of
          the foregoing records within seven days, e may proceed as if
          the records would have indicated that the entity in Probate
          possessed no units of the appropriate Currency or did not
          have a Will, as appropriate to the type of records not
          received.

      (d) During the seven days immediately following the Trustee's
          appointment, e shall make a diligent effort to determine all
          debts due to the entity in Probate.

      (e) Any entity who is owed a debt by the entity in Probate must
          inform the Trustee of that debt within seven days of the
          Trustee's appointment; any debt not reported to the Trustee
          within that time is deemed cancelled.

      (f) If any of the debts of or due to the entity in Probate is
          disputed, the Trustee shall not develop a Plan for the
          disposition of the estate of the entity in Probate until
          after all such dispute are settled, and in no case shall e
          do so until the expiration of the time allowed by
          subdivision (e) of this Rule.

      (g) As soon as possible after the time permitted to proceed by
          subdivision (e) of this Rule, the Trustee shall formulate
          and announce in the Public Forum a Plan for the disposition
          of the estate of the entity in Probate according to the
          provisions of the Probate Code.

      (h) If no objection to a Plan formulated pursuant to subdivision
          (g) of this Rule is posted in the Public Forum during a
          waiting period of seven days following its announcement, the
          Trustee shall, as soon as possible after the expiration of
          this waiting period, perform whatever steps are necessary to
          implement the Plan for disposition.

      (i) If an objection (other than an objection previously
          adjudicated to lack foundation) is made, the Trustee shall,
          as soon as possible after the objection was made, either:
        (1) discard the current Plan, and formulate and announce a new
            Plan; or
        (2) make a Call for Judgment alleging that the objection lacks
            foundation.

      (j) If a CFJ is made alleging that an objection to a Trustee's
          Plan lacks foundation, then the Trustee shall neither
          formulate a new Plan nor implement the existing Plan until
          the CFJ is resolved. If a CFJ finds that an objection lacks
          foundation, then the Trustee may proceed as if that
          objection had never been made, and any attempt to announce
          that same objection again shall be disregarded.

      (k) An objection to a Plan for disposition has foundation if it
          correctly alleges that:
        (1) the Plan constructed is not in accord with the provisions
            of the Probate Code;
        (2) the Plan disregards the Will (if any) of the entity in
            Probate;
        (3) the implementation of the Plan as constructed would be
            substantially unfair to a creditor or heir of the entity
            in Probate; or
        (4) the Plan would not fully dispose of the estate of the
            entity in Probate.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1601 be amended to read:

      (a) An entity is dissolute if it:
        (1) possesses any number of Units of Currency, or owes or is
            owed a debt; and
        (2) does not have an Executor.

      (b) The Notary shall place in Probate any dissolute entity which
          is not already in Probate, as soon as possible as e becomes
          aware of the dissolute entity.

      (c) A dissolute entity is considered to continue to have legal
          existence for as long as is necessary to complete its
          Probate (and thereby cease to be dissolute), even if it is
          dissolved, destroyed, or otherwise would cease to have legal
          existence prior to that time. An entity which has legal
          existence solely to this subdivision is called "terminal".

      (d) The following definitions apply with respect to entities in
          Probate:
        (1) Assets: all units of Currency held by the entity in
            Probate, along with all debts owed to the entity in
            Probate.
        (2) Liabilities: all debts owed by the entity in Probate.
        (3) Creditor: any entity which is the payee of a debt owed by
            the entity in Probate.
        (4) Debtor: any entity which is the payor of a debt owed to
            the entity in Probate.
        (5) Heir: an entity named in the Will (if any) of the entity
            in Probate.
        (6) Estate: the combined assets and liabilities of the entity
            in Probate.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1739 be amended to read:

      (a) The Plan for the disposition of the estate of an entity in
          Probate shall be constructed as detailed below.
        (1) The Plan shall divide the assets of the estate amongst its
            creditors, assigned to each creditor assets equal to the
            amount due that creditor, if it is possible to do so for
            all creditors, or a pro-rata portion otherwise.
        (2) If the entity is terminal, and has a Will, the assets
            remaining after all creditors have been assigned their
            shares shall be divided as specified in the Will of the
            entity in Probate. Any surplus remaining after the
            explicit provisions of the Will are applied shall be
            divided amongst the heirs in a manner consistent with the
            Will.
        (3) Any units of Currency remaining in the estate at this
            point shall be assigned to the Bank.

      (b) Methods of assignment:
        (1) Units of Currency are assigned to an entity by requiring
            that those units of Currency be transferred from the
            entity in Probate to that entity.
        (2) A debt owed by the entity in Probate is assigned by
            requiring the execution of a Notice of Debt setting forth
            a debt identical to the debt to be assigned except that it
            shall be due to the entity to whom the debt is being
            assigned.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1757 be amended to read:

      (a) The Trustee of an entity in Probate is authorized, all other
          Rules notwithstanding, to transfer Currency from the entity
          in Probate to any other entity as if e were that entity's
          Executor, when the Plan for the disposition of the estate of
          that entity requires it.

      (b) The Trustee may execute Notices of Debt when the Plan for
          the disposition of the estate of the entity requires it.

      (c) The Trustee of an entity in Probate ceases to be Trustee
          when:
        (1) e announces in the Public Forum that e resigns as Trustee;
        (2) e ceases to be a Player;
        (3) the entity of which e is Trustee ceases to be in Probate;
            or
        (4) the Notary announces that the Trustee has been removed.

      (d) An entity in Probate ceases to be in Probate when its
          Trustee announces the completion the implementation of a
          Plan for the disposition of the Estate of that entity.

          disposition of the Estate of an entity, all debts owed to or
          by that entity are deemed to be satisfied.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1637 be amended to read:

      (a) A Will is a document created by an entity which specifies
          how that entity prefers that its assets be disposed of in
          the event that it becomes dissolute.

      (b) The Trustee of an entity in Probate shall, in constructing
          the Plan for the disposal of the estate of that entity, be
          bound by and shall follow the provisions of that entity's
          Will to the extent that those provisions are applicable and
          not inconsistent with the Rules.

      (c) An entity may file its Will with the Notary. The Notary
          shall retain a copy of each Will filed with em until such
          time as that entity files a new Will or files a notice with
          the Notary cancelling the prior Will.

      (d) Neither the Notary nor the Trustee of an entity in Proabte
          is under any obligation to discover Wills not filed with the
          Notary, but a Trustee may determine, through examination of
          any relevant evidence found by or presented to em, that the
          entity of which e is Trustee had an unfiled Will superseding
          the Will filed with the Notary, and applying that Will

        (2) the amount of the levy, expressed as a percentage; and
        (3) the legal authorization for the levy.

      (c) Upon the announcement of a tax levy conforming with
          subdivision (b) of this Rule, each entity other than the
          Bank becomes liable to the Bank for a debt equal to the
          stated percentage of that entity's holdings of the Currency
          stated in the announcement. The amount of each entity's tax
          debt shall be based on the amount of that Currency owned by
          that entity at the time the announcement was made.

      (d) If the Currency taxed is intangible, the Recordkeepor of the
          Currency named in a tax levy shall, as soon as possible
          after the announcement, provide a report setting out the
          amount of the taxed Currency held by every entity which held
          any units of that Currency at the time the announcement was
          made. The Recordkeepor is not required to compute the tax

          debt to the Voting Bank for a number of Voting Tokens equal
          to the votes cast by that entity on that proposal,
|         multiplied by the voting cost of that Proposal.  This debt

      (d) If the Chancellor makes a transfer not permitted by

Protoproposal Chaos56 [rev. 12]

Currencies

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1721 be amended to read:

      There shall exist the Office of Chancellor.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1467 be amended to read:

      (a) A Currency is any medium of exchange which has designated as
          a Currency in accordance with the Rules.

      (b) The designation of a medium of exchange as a Currency, and
          the cancellation of such designation, may be accomplished
          only by:
        (1) the operation of an Instrument with Power 1 or greater;
        (2) the Chancellor, Without Objection; or
        (3) Judicial Order, whenever the Rules so permit.

      (c) For the purposes of the Rules, units of a Currency are
          fungible and indivisible.

|     (d) No tangible medium of exchange shall be designated as a
|         Currency.
| 
|     (e) A Currency may be denominated such that a fraction of its
          primary denomination is its smallest indivisible unit, so
          long as there is a smallest indivisible unit.  When no other
          specification exists, the smallest indivisible unit of a
          Currency shall be one unit of its smallest denomination. 
          Amounts less than this smallest indivisible unit may be used
          in intermediate calculations; all such calculations shall be
          rounded off at the point that they are reduced to transfers,
          orders to transfer, or other finalized results of legal
          import.

|     (f) The Chancellor shall retain and published at least monthly a
          schedule, listing every medium of exchange designated as a
          Currency under this Rule.  This schedule shall include
          whatever information the Chancellor deems necessary, but at
|         least the following information for each Currency:
|       (1) the designated denomination or denominations of that
|           Currency (and if more than one, the relationship between
|           them);
|       (2) the fraction of the smallest denomination of that Currency
|           which is its smallest indivisible unit;
|       (3) that Currency's Recordkeepor; and,
|       (4) the Mintor or Mintors of that Currency, if any.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

|     (a) The "Recordkeeper" of a Currency refers to the entity who
|         has agreed to maintain a record of the ownership of the
|         units of that Currency.  The Recordkeepor of an Currency is
          subject to the jurisdiction of these Rules.  Specifically, e
          shall:
        (1) maintain the abovementioned records in a manner consistent
            with these Rules, including the timely recordation of
            transfers of ownership made consistent with the Rules;
        (2) comply in a timely manner to all requests to produce those
            records as required by the Rules; and
        (3) perform all other duties which the Rules impose upon the
|           Recordkeepor of a Currency.

|     (b) A Currency may have any number of designated Mintors.  A
|         Mintor may be designated for a Currency, or such designated
|         cancelled, by:
        (1) the operation of an Instrument with Power 1 or greater; or
        (2) the Chancellor, Without Objection.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1598 be amended to read:

|     Units of a Currency are transferred only when the Recordkeepor
|     of that Currency receives a notice from the owner of one or more
|     units of that Currency, specifying the units to be transferred
|     and the entity who is to owner the units thus transferred.  The
|     entity receiving the units thus transferred becomes their owner,
|     and the Recordkeepor shall so note this on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1471 be amended to read:

|     Units of a Currency are created only when the Recordkeepor of
|     that Currency receives a notice from a designated Mintor of that
|     Currency, specifying the number of units to be created and the
|     entity who is to own the units so created.  The specified entity
|     owns the units so created, and the Recordkeepor shall so note
|     this on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

|     Units of a Currency are destroyed only when the Recordkeepor of
|     that Currency receives a notice from the owner of one or more
|     units of that Currency, specifying the units to be destroyed. 
|     The Recordkeepor shall note this destruction on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1596 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever an entity becomes indebted to another for some
          amount of Currency, that entity indebted is required to
          transfer that amount of Currency to the entity indebted to
          within seven days.

      (b) A debt not paid within seven days is overdue.  Any entity to
          whom an overdue debt is due may assess a late penalty of not
          more than 25% of the overdue debt, and may do so repeatedly,
          not more than once every seven days after the debt becomes
          overdue.  Late penalties are added to the overdue debt.  An
          entity may elect to charge smaller late penalties, charge
          them less frequently, or forego late penalties altogether,
          at that entity's sole discretion.

      (c) If the validity of a debt, or any part thereof, is disputed
          by a Call for Judgement, that debt (or portion thereof) is
          not considered overdue, and does not accrue late penalties,
          while the dispute remains unsettled.

      (d) When an entity transfers units of Currency to another entity
          for the purpose of making a payment on debt, the receiving
          entity shall apply that payment to the nondisputed debts
          owed to em by the transferring entity, in order from oldest
          to newest.  A debt is paid when a transfer has been applied
          to it in this manner.  Any surplus will be retained by the
          receiving entity, to be applied to future debts or returned
          upon demand.

      (e) An entity may assume that any Currencies transferred to it
          to be payments on debts due to em, unless the transferree
          clearly indicates otherwise when making the transfer.

      (f) An entity who is owed an overdue debt may issue an Order
          requiring the entity who owes that debt to make payment by
          requiring a transfer of any amount up to the amount of the
          debt due, but only if no other Order currently in force
          requires the same entity to make payment on that same debt
          or any part thereof.  Such an Order shall be stayed (by the
          Clerk of the Courts) if the debt in question is subsequently
          disputed, and vacated (by the Judge) if it is found that the
          debt upon which the Order is based is invalid.

      (g) An entity who is owed a debt may cancel all or part of that
          debt at any time.

      (h) A Judge may enjoin the assessment of late penalties,
          restrict the amount of late penalties, or require the
          reduction or cancellation of a debt, by Judicial Order, when
          the Rules specifically so allow.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1479 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever a Rule calls for an Officer to pay out some
          quantity of Currency to some entity, that Officer shall
          execute a Notice of Debt for the given amount with that
          entity as payee and the Bank as payor.

      (b) Whenever a Rule calls for an Officer to bill an entity for
          some quantity of Currency, that Officer shall execute a
          Notice of Debt for the given amount with that entity as
          payor and the Bank as payee.

      (c) A Notice of Debt is executed by announcing in the Public
          Forum that the payor is indebted to the payee for the amount
          indicated, so long as the announcement sets for the reason
          therefore.

      (d) The lawful execution of a Notice of Debt causes the payor
          noted therein to be indebted to the payee noted therein for
          the amount noted therein, but only if the executor of the
          Notice of Debt was authorized to execute it, and the reason
          set forth therein is correct.

      (e) The duties required of Officers by this Rule shall be
          performed as soon as possible after they arise.

      (f) For the purposes of this Rule, the Speaker shall be
          considered an Officer.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1817 be amended to read:

|     (a) The Recordkeepor of a Currency is required to record every
|         transfer for which e receives a transfer notice denominated
|         in the Currency of which e is the recordkeepor, when:
        (1) the notice was sent by the transferring entity's Executor,
            or, for an entity which lacks an Executor, by any other
            person empowered by the Rules to execute transfers on the
            behalf of the transferring entity;
        (2) the notice clearly sets forth the quantity to be
            transferred in a form such that the Recordkeepor can
            easily and definitively determine the amount being
            transferred;
        (3) the entity to receive the transfer is specified with
            sufficient clarity that a reasonable person in the
            Recordkeepor's position would know to which entity the
            transferring entity refers; and
        (4) the transfer is for an amount not more than the current
            holdings of the transferring entity.

      (b) Transfers shall be noted on the Recordkeepor's records in
          the order in which they are received by the Recordkeepor.

      (c) When a Recordkeepor records a transfer, e shall promptly
          inform the recipient of the transfer that the transfer has
          been recorded, unless it appears to the Recordkeepor that
          the recipient is already aware of the transfer.

      (d) When a Recordkeepor elects not to record a transfer for the
          reason that the transfer is not in conformance with any part
          of subdivision (a) of this Rule, e shall promptly inform
          both the transferrer and the recipient that the transfer has
          not be recorded, and give the reason therefor.  (If the
          reason for failure to record is that the recipient was not
          clearly specified, there is no duty to inform the
          recipient.)

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1696 be amended to read:

|     (a) Voting Tokens are hereby designated as a Currency.  The sole
|         designated Mintor of Voting Tokens is the Bank.  The
|         Recordkeepor of Voting Tokens is irrevocably designated to
|         be the Accountor.  The smallest indivisible unit for this
|         Currency is 0.01 Voting Token.

      (b) The Accountor constructively agrees to act as Recordkeepor
          for Voting Tokens by accepting the Office.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1701 be amended to read:

|     (a) Proposal Notes are hereby designated as a Currency.  The
|         sole designated Mintor of Proposal Notes is the Bank.  The
|         Recordkeepor of Proposal Notes is irrevocably designated to
|         be the Promotor.

      (b) The Promotor constructively agrees to act as Recordkeepor
          for Proposal Notes by accepting the Office.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1435 be amended to read:

|     (a) Indulgences are hereby designated as a Currency.  The sole
|         designated Mintor of Indulgences is the Bank.  The
          Recordkeepor of Indulgences is irrevocably designated to be
          the Herald.

      (b) The Herald constructively agrees to act as Recordkeepor for
          Indulgences by accepting the Office.

      (c) An entity which owes a debt (or debts) to the Bank for any
          number of Indulgences is said to have that number of Blots.
          A Player has Blots equal to the sum of all such debts. Debts
          which are in dispute are still considered when determining
          how many Blots a Player has.

      (d) When a Rule states that a Player is to gain some number of
          Blots, a Notice of Debt shall be executed for the same
          number of Indulgences, naming that Player as the payor and
          the Bank as payee; this order shall be executed by whomever
          the Rules require to report the change in Blots.

      (e) A Player who has no debt in Indulgences to the Bank is
          Immaculate.

      (f) It is a Win-Preventing condition for a Player to have one or
          more Blots.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1846 be amended to read:

|     (a) Ergs are hereby designated as a Currency.  The sole
|         designated Mintor of Ergs is the Bank.  The Recordkeepor of
|         Ergs is irrevocably designated to be the Cartographor.

      (b) The Cartographor constructively agrees to act as
          Recordkeepor for Ergs by accepting the Office.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1738 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever there is an entity in Probate which does not have a
          Trustee, the Notary shall nominate a Player to be that
          entity's Trustee.  E shall announce this appointment in the
          Public Forum.

      (b) As soon as possible after the Notary announces the
          appointment of a Trustee for an entity in Probate, the
          following records shall be provided to the Trustee:
        (1) by the Recordkeepor of each Currency, an accounting of the
            number of units of that Currency held by the entity in
            Probate; and
        (2) by the Notary, any Will of the entity in Probate which has
            been filed with the Notary.

      (c) In the event that the Trustee does not receive any part of
          the foregoing records within seven days, e may proceed as if
          the records would have indicated that the entity in Probate
          possessed no units of the appropriate Currency or did not
          have a Will, as appropriate to the type of records not
          received.

      (d) During the seven days immediately following the Trustee's
          appointment, e shall make a diligent effort to determine all
          debts due to the entity in Probate.

      (e) Any entity who is owed a debt by the entity in Probate must
          inform the Trustee of that debt within seven days of the
          Trustee's appointment; any debt not reported to the Trustee
          within that time is deemed cancelled.

      (f) If any of the debts of or due to the entity in Probate is
          disputed, the Trustee shall not develop a Plan for the
          disposition of the estate of the entity in Probate until
          after all such dispute are settled, and in no case shall e
          do so until the expiration of the time allowed by
          subdivision (e) of this Rule.

      (g) As soon as possible after the time permitted to proceed by
          subdivision (e) of this Rule, the Trustee shall formulate
          and announce in the Public Forum a Plan for the disposition
          of the estate of the entity in Probate according to the
          provisions of the Probate Code.

      (h) If no objection to a Plan formulated pursuant to subdivision
          (g) of this Rule is posted in the Public Forum during a
          waiting period of seven days following its announcement, the
          Trustee shall, as soon as possible after the expiration of
          this waiting period, perform whatever steps are necessary to
          implement the Plan for disposition.

      (i) If an objection (other than an objection previously
          adjudicated to lack foundation) is made, the Trustee shall,
          as soon as possible after the objection was made, either:
        (1) discard the current Plan, and formulate and announce a new
            Plan; or
        (2) make a Call for Judgment alleging that the objection lacks
            foundation.

      (j) If a CFJ is made alleging that an objection to a Trustee's
          Plan lacks foundation, then the Trustee shall neither
          formulate a new Plan nor implement the existing Plan until
          the CFJ is resolved.  If a CFJ finds that an objection lacks
          foundation, then the Trustee may proceed as if that
          objection had never been made, and any attempt to announce
          that same objection again shall be disregarded.

      (k) An objection to a Plan for disposition has foundation if it
          correctly alleges that:
        (1) the Plan constructed is not in accord with the provisions
            of the Probate Code;
        (2) the Plan disregards the Will (if any) of the entity in
            Probate;
        (3) the implementation of the Plan as constructed would be
            substantially unfair to a creditor or heir of the entity
            in Probate; or
        (4) the Plan would not fully dispose of the estate of the
            entity in Probate.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1601 be amended to read:

      (a) An entity is dissolute if it:
        (1) possesses any number of Units of Currency, or owes or is
            owed a debt; and
        (2) does not have an Executor.

      (b) The Notary shall place in Probate any dissolute entity which
          is not already in Probate, as soon as possible as e becomes
          aware of the dissolute entity.

      (c) A dissolute entity is considered to continue to have legal
          existence for as long as is necessary to complete its
          Probate (and thereby cease to be dissolute), even if it is
          dissolved, destroyed, or otherwise would cease to have legal
          existence prior to that time.  An entity which has legal
          existence solely to this subdivision is called "terminal".

      (d) The following definitions apply with respect to entities in
          Probate:
        (1) Assets: all units of Currency held by the entity in
            Probate, along with all debts owed to the entity in
            Probate.
        (2) Liabilities: all debts owed by the entity in Probate.
        (3) Creditor: any entity which is the payee of a debt owed by
            the entity in Probate.
        (4) Debtor: any entity which is the payor of a debt owed to
            the entity in Probate.
        (5) Heir: an entity named in the Will (if any) of the entity
            in Probate.
        (6) Estate: the combined assets and liabilities of the entity
            in Probate.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1739 be amended to read:

      (a) The Plan for the disposition of the estate of an entity in
          Probate shall be constructed as detailed below.
        (1) The Plan shall divide the assets of the estate amongst its
            creditors, assigned to each creditor assets equal to the
            amount due that creditor, if it is possible to do so for
            all creditors, or a pro-rata portion otherwise.
        (2) If the entity is terminal, and has a Will, the assets
            remaining after all creditors have been assigned their
            shares shall be divided as specified in the Will of the
            entity in Probate.  Any surplus remaining after the
            explicit provisions of the Will are applied shall be
            divided amongst the heirs in a manner consistent with the
            Will.
        (3) Any units of Currency remaining in the estate at this
            point shall be assigned to the Bank.

      (b) Methods of assignment:
        (1) Units of Currency are assigned to an entity by requiring
            that those units of Currency be transferred from the
            entity in Probate to that entity.
        (2) A debt owed by the entity in Probate is assigned by
            requiring the execution of a Notice of Debt setting forth
            a debt identical to the debt to be assigned except that it
            shall be due to the entity to whom the debt is being
            assigned.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1757 be amended to read:

      (a) The Trustee of an entity in Probate is authorized, all other
          Rules notwithstanding, to transfer Currency from the entity
          in Probate to any other entity as if e were that entity's
          Executor, when the Plan for the disposition of the estate of
          that entity requires it.

      (b) The Trustee may execute Notices of Debt when the Plan for
          the disposition of the estate of the entity requires it.

      (c) The Trustee of an entity in Probate ceases to be Trustee
          when:
        (1) e announces in the Public Forum that e resigns as Trustee;
        (2) e ceases to be a Player;

Protoproposal Chaos67 [rev. 1]

Eliminate ASAP I

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 208 be amended to read:

      (a) The Assessor shall publish all the Votes cast upon a
          Proposal within seven days of the end of that Proposal's
          Voting Period.

      (b) The Assessor shall not publish the Votes cast on a Proposal
          prior to the time e publishes the Votes cast on:

        (2) all Proposals whose Voting Periods ended at the same time
            as the Proposal in question and which have a lower number.

      (c) The failure of the Assessor to publish the Votes cast upon a
          Proposal within the time limits established by this Rule in
          no way abates the Assessor's duty to publish the Votes cast
          on that Proposal.

You have a lot of work in front of you showing that a viable private
economy is only possible with Probate, Probate Plans, Wills, Trustees
and Executors in Probate. These parts of the Ruleset are hardly ever
used. What's the connection?

This is good as far as it goes, but paragraph (c) looks like an
instance of what Blob calls a "persistent obligation", the general case
of which should probably be defined elsewhere, so that it can invoked in
cases just like this, of which there should be plenty.

I think you could quickly finish wrirting the rest of it just by
deleting that last sentence. It doesn't do anything.

They're hardly ever used precisely because we don't have a viable
private economy.

The entire point of Probate is to ensure that creditors are not
completely stiffed when an indebted entity ceases to exist.
Without this, all you'd have to do to screw people out of their money
is create a holding entity (i.e. a contest) and use it as a shield
against personally incurring private debts.  When the holding entity's
debts become problematic, you just dissolve the entity.  Without
Probate, the holding entity's creditors are left holding the bag.

I don't see this complementary to the ROM Proposal. I've no objection to
this Proposal in principle, but I do object to giving the CotC the power
to select Judges as e pleases, which is what the ROM Proposal does (the
single word which has been deleted is "randomly"). Even if we're going to
adopt "Turns for all", we should definitely keep R951 as it is, with
random Judge selection.

Ah, I suspected as much: we have quite different ideas of what
constitutes a viable private economy. What your observation amounts to
is that we don't have system in which loans, credit, interest, venture
capital and so on play a central role. That is true. And it's also true
that if we did have system with a lot of lending and credit, we would
need some mechanism to prevent the kinds of abuse you outline above.
But, while it might be interesting to have such concepts, it has not
been an aim of mine to move in that direction. I'm not convinced they're
really appropriate here. Venture capitalism only makes sense when there
are ventures which need capital to be realised (and a pool of investors
with capital to invest).

But how do you get the Debts to go to the Contest? Aren't almost all debts
"private debts"? In which case, isn't the only way to stiff people in 
this way, to deregister when you had large debts? And won't you lose 
all your holdings in any case, if you do this?

And aren't almost all debts expressed as payments to the Bank? So what if
a player "stiffs" the Bank in this way? 

I just don't see how this is scammable at all. Can you please, give us a 
more concrete example?

Well, it's complementary in the sense that if I was going to adopt the
change to 951, I would also adopt this change, as a kind of check to
the abuse of privilege by the CotC. The CotC would have to be a little 
more stategic about selecting a Judge if e knew that e could not select
the same judge again for some time.

I was going to proposal these two things together, but then I realised
that they were orthogonal changes, and some people, like you, might 
support one without the other.

Just so that no-one should underestimate the amount of work that getting
rid of "asap" would involve,

grep -n "possible" rules.oct20 | wc

gives 81 occurrences of the word "possible" in the Oct 20 Ruleset. A
further grep reveals that only 9 of these are uses of the word
"possible" outside the phrase "as soon as possible", leaving 72
occurrences of "as soon as possible" in the Ruleset.

I'm not against the change, for Blob's reconceptualization is quite
elegant. But I don't envy whoever is going to write the Proposal to do
it.

It is intended to do something, but what it is intended to do relates
to something I haven't written yet.

So far.  Nobody seems to have made any use of Rule 1759 to date.

Protoproposal Chaos56 [rev. 13]

Currencies

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1721 be amended to read:

      There shall exist the Office of Chancellor.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1467 be amended to read:

      (a) A Currency is any medium of exchange which has designated as
          a Currency in accordance with the Rules.

      (b) The designation of a medium of exchange as a Currency, and
          the cancellation of such designation, may be accomplished
          only by:
        (1) the operation of an Instrument with Power 1 or greater;
        (2) the Chancellor, Without Objection; or
        (3) Judicial Order, whenever the Rules so permit.

      (c) For the purposes of the Rules, units of a Currency are
          fungible and indivisible.

      (d) No tangible medium of exchange shall be designated as a
          Currency.

      (e) A Currency may be denominated such that a fraction of its
          primary denomination is its smallest indivisible unit, so
          long as there is a smallest indivisible unit.  When no other
          specification exists, the smallest indivisible unit of a
          Currency shall be one unit of its smallest denomination. 
          Amounts less than this smallest indivisible unit may be used
          in intermediate calculations; all such calculations shall be
          rounded off at the point that they are reduced to transfers,
          orders to transfer, or other finalized results of legal
          import.

|     (f) The Chancellor shall retain and publish at least monthly a
          schedule, listing every medium of exchange designated as a
          Currency under this Rule.  This schedule shall include
          whatever information the Chancellor deems necessary, but at
          least the following information for each Currency:
        (1) the designated denomination or denominations of that
            Currency (and if more than one, the relationship between
            them);
        (2) the fraction of the smallest denomination of that Currency
            which is its smallest indivisible unit;
        (3) that Currency's Recordkeepor; and,
        (4) the Mintor or Mintors of that Currency, if any.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) The "Recordkeeper" of a Currency refers to the entity who
          has agreed to maintain a record of the ownership of the
          units of that Currency.  The Recordkeepor of an Currency is
          subject to the jurisdiction of these Rules.  Specifically, e
          shall:
        (1) maintain the abovementioned records in a manner consistent
            with these Rules, including the timely recordation of
            transfers of ownership made consistent with the Rules;
        (2) comply in a timely manner to all requests to produce those
            records as required by the Rules; and
        (3) perform all other duties which the Rules impose upon the
            Recordkeepor of a Currency.

      (b) A Currency may have any number of designated Mintors.  A
          Mintor may be designated for a Currency, or such designated
          cancelled, by:
        (1) the operation of an Instrument with Power 1 or greater; or
        (2) the Chancellor, Without Objection.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1598 be amended to read:

      Units of a Currency are transferred only when the Recordkeepor
      of that Currency receives a notice from the owner of one or more
      units of that Currency, specifying the units to be transferred
      and the entity who is to owner the units thus transferred.  The
      entity receiving the units thus transferred becomes their owner,
      and the Recordkeepor shall so note this on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1471 be amended to read:

      Units of a Currency are created only when the Recordkeepor of
      that Currency receives a notice from a designated Mintor of that
      Currency, specifying the number of units to be created and the
      entity who is to own the units so created.  The specified entity
      owns the units so created, and the Recordkeepor shall so note
      this on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      Units of a Currency are destroyed only when the Recordkeepor of
      that Currency receives a notice from the owner of one or more
      units of that Currency, specifying the units to be destroyed. 
      The Recordkeepor shall note this destruction on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1596 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever an entity becomes indebted to another for some
          amount of Currency, that entity indebted is required to
          transfer that amount of Currency to the entity indebted to
          within seven days.

      (b) A debt not paid within seven days is overdue.  Any entity to
          whom an overdue debt is due may assess a late penalty of not
          more than 25% of the overdue debt, and may do so repeatedly,
          not more than once every seven days after the debt becomes
          overdue.  Late penalties are added to the overdue debt.  An
          entity may elect to charge smaller late penalties, charge
          them less frequently, or forego late penalties altogether,
          at that entity's sole discretion.

      (c) If the validity of a debt, or any part thereof, is disputed
          by a Call for Judgement, that debt (or portion thereof) is
          not considered overdue, and does not accrue late penalties,
          while the dispute remains unsettled.

      (d) When an entity transfers units of Currency to another entity
          for the purpose of making a payment on debt, the receiving
          entity shall apply that payment to the nondisputed debts
          owed to em by the transferring entity, in order from oldest
          to newest.  A debt is paid when a transfer has been applied
          to it in this manner.  Any surplus will be retained by the
          receiving entity, to be applied to future debts or returned
          upon demand.

      (e) An entity may assume that any Currencies transferred to it
          to be payments on debts due to em, unless the transferree
          clearly indicates otherwise when making the transfer.

      (f) An entity who is owed an overdue debt may issue an Order
          requiring the entity who owes that debt to make payment by
          requiring a transfer of any amount up to the amount of the
          debt due, but only if no other Order currently in force
          requires the same entity to make payment on that same debt
          or any part thereof.  Such an Order shall be stayed (by the
          Clerk of the Courts) if the debt in question is subsequently
          disputed, and vacated (by the Judge) if it is found that the
          debt upon which the Order is based is invalid.

      (g) An entity who is owed a debt may cancel all or part of that
          debt at any time.

      (h) A Judge may enjoin the assessment of late penalties,
          restrict the amount of late penalties, or require the
          reduction or cancellation of a debt, by Judicial Order, when
          the Rules specifically so allow.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1479 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever a Rule calls for an Officer to pay out some
          quantity of Currency to some entity, that Officer shall
          execute a Notice of Debt for the given amount with that
          entity as payee and the Bank as payor.

      (b) Whenever a Rule calls for an Officer to bill an entity for
          some quantity of Currency, that Officer shall execute a
          Notice of Debt for the given amount with that entity as
          payor and the Bank as payee.

      (c) A Notice of Debt is executed by announcing in the Public
          Forum that the payor is indebted to the payee for the amount
          indicated, so long as the announcement sets for the reason
          therefore.

      (d) The lawful execution of a Notice of Debt causes the payor
          noted therein to be indebted to the payee noted therein for
          the amount noted therein, but only if the executor of the
          Notice of Debt was authorized to execute it, and the reason
          set forth therein is correct.

      (e) The duties required of Officers by this Rule shall be
          performed as soon as possible after they arise.

      (f) For the purposes of this Rule, the Speaker shall be
          considered an Officer.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1817 be amended to read:

      (a) The Recordkeepor of a Currency is required to record every
          transfer for which e receives a transfer notice denominated
          in the Currency of which e is the recordkeepor, when:
        (1) the notice was sent by the transferring entity's Executor,
            or, for an entity which lacks an Executor, by any other
            person empowered by the Rules to execute transfers on the
            behalf of the transferring entity;
        (2) the notice clearly sets forth the quantity to be
            transferred in a form such that the Recordkeepor can
            easily and definitively determine the amount being
            transferred;
        (3) the entity to receive the transfer is specified with
            sufficient clarity that a reasonable person in the
            Recordkeepor's position would know to which entity the
            transferring entity refers; and
        (4) the transfer is for an amount not more than the current
            holdings of the transferring entity.

      (b) Transfers shall be noted on the Recordkeepor's records in
          the order in which they are received by the Recordkeepor.

      (c) When a Recordkeepor records a transfer, e shall promptly
          inform the recipient of the transfer that the transfer has
          been recorded, unless it appears to the Recordkeepor that
          the recipient is already aware of the transfer.

      (d) When a Recordkeepor elects not to record a transfer for the
          reason that the transfer is not in conformance with any part
          of subdivision (a) of this Rule, e shall promptly inform
          both the transferrer and the recipient that the transfer has
          not be recorded, and give the reason therefor.  (If the
          reason for failure to record is that the recipient was not
          clearly specified, there is no duty to inform the
          recipient.)

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1696 be amended to read:

      (a) Voting Tokens are hereby designated as a Currency.  The sole
          designated Mintor of Voting Tokens is the Bank.  The
          Recordkeepor of Voting Tokens is irrevocably designated to
          be the Accountor.  The smallest indivisible unit for this
          Currency is 0.01 Voting Token.

      (b) The Accountor constructively agrees to act as Recordkeepor
          for Voting Tokens by accepting the Office.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1701 be amended to read:

      (a) Proposal Notes are hereby designated as a Currency.  The
          sole designated Mintor of Proposal Notes is the Bank.  The
          Recordkeepor of Proposal Notes is irrevocably designated to
          be the Promotor.

      (b) The Promotor constructively agrees to act as Recordkeepor
          for Proposal Notes by accepting the Office.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1435 be amended to read:

      (a) Indulgences are hereby designated as a Currency.  The sole
          designated Mintor of Indulgences is the Bank.  The
          Recordkeepor of Indulgences is irrevocably designated to be
          the Herald.

      (b) The Herald constructively agrees to act as Recordkeepor for
          Indulgences by accepting the Office.

      (c) An entity which owes a debt (or debts) to the Bank for any
          number of Indulgences is said to have that number of Blots.
          A Player has Blots equal to the sum of all such debts. Debts
          which are in dispute are still considered when determining
          how many Blots a Player has.

      (d) When a Rule states that a Player is to gain some number of
          Blots, a Notice of Debt shall be executed for the same
          number of Indulgences, naming that Player as the payor and
          the Bank as payee; this order shall be executed by whomever
          the Rules require to report the change in Blots.

      (e) A Player who has no debt in Indulgences to the Bank is
          Immaculate.

      (f) It is a Win-Preventing condition for a Player to have one or
          more Blots.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1846 be amended to read:

      (a) Ergs are hereby designated as a Currency.  The sole
          designated Mintor of Ergs is the Bank.  The Recordkeepor of
          Ergs is irrevocably designated to be the Cartographor.

      (b) The Cartographor constructively agrees to act as
          Recordkeepor for Ergs by accepting the Office.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1738 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever there is an entity in Probate which does not have a
          Trustee, the Notary shall nominate a Player to be that
          entity's Trustee.  E shall announce this appointment in the
          Public Forum.

      (b) As soon as possible after the Notary announces the
          appointment of a Trustee for an entity in Probate, the
          following records shall be provided to the Trustee:
        (1) by the Recordkeepor of each Currency, an accounting of the
            number of units of that Currency held by the entity in
            Probate; and
        (2) by the Notary, any Will of the entity in Probate which has
            been filed with the Notary.

      (c) In the event that the Trustee does not receive any part of
          the foregoing records within seven days, e may proceed as if
          the records would have indicated that the entity in Probate
          possessed no units of the appropriate Currency or did not
          have a Will, as appropriate to the type of records not
          received.

      (d) During the seven days immediately following the Trustee's
          appointment, e shall make a diligent effort to determine all
          debts due to the entity in Probate.

      (e) Any entity who is owed a debt by the entity in Probate must
          inform the Trustee of that debt within seven days of the
          Trustee's appointment; any debt not reported to the Trustee
          within that time is deemed cancelled.

      (f) If any of the debts of or due to the entity in Probate is
          disputed, the Trustee shall not develop a Plan for the
          disposition of the estate of the entity in Probate until
          after all such dispute are settled, and in no case shall e
          do so until the expiration of the time allowed by
          subdivision (e) of this Rule.

      (g) As soon as possible after the time permitted to proceed by
          subdivision (e) of this Rule, the Trustee shall formulate
          and announce in the Public Forum a Plan for the disposition
          of the estate of the entity in Probate according to the
          provisions of the Probate Code.

      (h) If no objection to a Plan formulated pursuant to subdivision
          (g) of this Rule is posted in the Public Forum during a
          waiting period of seven days following its announcement, the
          Trustee shall, as soon as possible after the expiration of
          this waiting period, perform whatever steps are necessary to
          implement the Plan for disposition.

      (i) If an objection (other than an objection previously
          adjudicated to lack foundation) is made, the Trustee shall,
          as soon as possible after the objection was made, either:
        (1) discard the current Plan, and formulate and announce a new
            Plan; or
        (2) make a Call for Judgment alleging that the objection lacks
            foundation.

      (j) If a CFJ is made alleging that an objection to a Trustee's
          Plan lacks foundation, then the Trustee shall neither
          formulate a new Plan nor implement the existing Plan until
          the CFJ is resolved.  If a CFJ finds that an objection lacks
          foundation, then the Trustee may proceed as if that
          objection had never been made, and any attempt to announce
          that same objection again shall be disregarded.

      (k) An objection to a Plan for disposition has foundation if it
          correctly alleges that:
        (1) the Plan constructed is not in accord with the provisions
            of the Probate Code;
        (2) the Plan disregards the Will (if any) of the entity in
            Probate;
        (3) the implementation of the Plan as constructed would be
            substantially unfair to a creditor or heir of the entity
            in Probate; or
        (4) the Plan would not fully dispose of the estate of the
            entity in Probate.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1601 be amended to read:

      (a) An entity is dissolute if it:
        (1) possesses any number of Units of Currency, or owes or is
            owed a debt; and
        (2) does not have an Executor.

      (b) The Notary shall place in Probate any dissolute entity which
          is not already in Probate, as soon as possible as e becomes
          aware of the dissolute entity.

      (c) A dissolute entity is considered to continue to have legal
          existence for as long as is necessary to complete its
          Probate (and thereby cease to be dissolute), even if it is
          dissolved, destroyed, or otherwise would cease to have legal
          existence prior to that time.  An entity which has legal
          existence solely to this subdivision is called "terminal".

      (d) The following definitions apply with respect to entities in
          Probate:
        (1) Assets: all units of Currency held by the entity in
            Probate, along with all debts owed to the entity in
            Probate.
        (2) Liabilities: all debts owed by the entity in Probate.
        (3) Creditor: any entity which is the payee of a debt owed by
            the entity in Probate.
        (4) Debtor: any entity which is the payor of a debt owed to
            the entity in Probate.
        (5) Heir: an entity named in the Will (if any) of the entity
            in Probate.
        (6) Estate: the combined assets and liabilities of the entity
            in Probate.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1739 be amended to read:

      (a) The Plan for the disposition of the estate of an entity in
          Probate shall be constructed as detailed below.
        (1) The Plan shall divide the assets of the estate amongst its
            creditors, assigned to each creditor assets equal to the
            amount due that creditor, if it is possible to do so for
            all creditors, or a pro-rata portion otherwise.
        (2) If the entity is terminal, and has a Will, the assets
            remaining after all creditors have been assigned their
            shares shall be divided as specified in the Will of the
            entity in Probate.  Any surplus remaining after the
            explicit provisions of the Will are applied shall be
            divided amongst the heirs in a manner consistent with the
            Will.
        (3) Any units of Currency remaining in the estate at this
            point shall be assigned to the Bank.

      (b) Methods of assignment:
        (1) Units of Currency are assigned to an entity by requiring
            that those units of Currency be transferred from the
            entity in Probate to that entity.
        (2) A debt owed by the entity in Probate is assigned by
            requiring the execution of a Notice of Debt setting forth
            a debt identical to the debt to be assigned except that it
            shall be due to the entity to whom the debt is being
            assigned.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1757 be amended to read:

      (a) The Trustee of an entity in Probate is authorized, all other
          Rules notwithstanding, to transfer Currency from the entity
          in Probate to any other entity as if e were that entity's
          Executor, when the Plan for the disposition of the estate of
          that entity requires it.

      (b) The Trustee may execute Notices of Debt when the Plan for
          the disposition of the estate of the entity requires it.

      (c) The Trustee of an entity in Probate ceases to be Trustee
          when:
        (1) e announces in the Public Forum that e resigns as Trustee;
        (2) e ceases to be a Player;
        (3) the entity of which e is Trustee ceases to be in Probate;
            or
        (4) the Notary announces that the Trustee has been removed.

      (d) An entity in Probate ceases to be in Probate when its
          Trustee announces the completion the implementation of a
          Plan for the disposition of the Estate of that entity.

      (e) Upon the completion of the implementation of a Plan for the
          disposition of the Estate of an entity, all debts owed to or
          by that entity are deemed to be satisfied.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1637 be amended to read:

      (a) A Will is a document created by an entity which specifies
          how that entity prefers that its assets be disposed of in
          the event that it becomes dissolute.

      (b) The Trustee of an entity in Probate shall, in constructing
          the Plan for the disposal of the estate of that entity, be
          bound by and shall follow the provisions of that entity's
          Will to the extent that those provisions are applicable and
          not inconsistent with the Rules.

      (c) An entity may file its Will with the Notary.  The Notary
          shall retain a copy of each Will filed with em until such
          time as that entity files a new Will or files a notice with
          the Notary cancelling the prior Will.

      (d) Neither the Notary nor the Trustee of an entity in Proabte
          is under any obligation to discover Wills not filed with the
          Notary, but a Trustee may determine, through examination of
          any relevant evidence found by or presented to em, that the
          entity of which e is Trustee had an unfiled Will superseding
          the Will filed with the Notary, and applying that Will
          instead.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1853 be amended to read:

      (a) Taxes may be levied only when the Rules explicitly permit
          it, and then only by the Officer authorized by the Rule

          An announcement of levy must specify:
        (1) The Currency being taxed;
        (2) the amount of the levy, expressed as a percentage; and
        (3) the legal authorization for the levy.

      (c) Upon the announcement of a tax levy conforming with
          subdivision (b) of this Rule, each entity other than the
          Bank becomes liable to the Bank for a debt equal to the
          stated percentage of that entity's holdings of the Currency
          stated in the announcement.  The amount of each entity's tax
          debt shall be based on the amount of that Currency owned by
          that entity at the time the announcement was made.

      (d) The Recordkeepor of the Currency named in a tax levy shall,
          as soon as possible after the announcement, provide a report
          setting out the amount of the taxed Currency held by every
          entity which held any units of that Currency at the time the
          announcement was made.  The Recordkeepor is not required to
          compute the tax due; if e does so, eir computations do not
          have any legal force.

      (b) Each Voting Entity who votes on a Proposal is liable to a
          debt to the Voting Bank for a number of Voting Tokens equal
          to the votes cast by that entity on that proposal,
          multiplied by the voting cost of that Proposal.  This debt
          is realized when the results of the Voting on that Proposal
          are announced.

These uses of 'shall', particularly the last two, strike me as odd. (I
know that such uses already occur in the Ruleset (cf R1688), and I think
they're odd there aswell.) Why not say "The Bank exists." and "The
Chancellor is the Executor of the Bank."?

It would be good if you could provide a summary of what this Proposal
will do if adopted. I can see that it represents (yet another) pretty
significant change in the way we do things.

I'm not sure there'd be any point in my doing so; my interpretation
will be biased by virtue of being its author.

Why not repeal 1759 too then? Honestly, I see no need for it. Transactions
between players can be done on a basis of trust, at least for the time
being. If we ever find that we need enforceable debts between players,
then we can add it later. The only reason why we have enforceable debts
to the Bank, is that the Bank cannot pick and choose who it deals with.
Players can. If they get burnt, it's their problem. In a community of
our size, there are many more ways to deal with a betrayal of trust
than legislated enforcement.
