In updating the Ruleset, I just realized that there is a very good
reason why Morendil minted his currencies as Misanthropists'
Group Currencies, rather than under his authority as a Player--
PC removed Mint Authority from Players.  (A Proposal will
follow shortly.)

Oops, yes, I can see how that happened: I wrote the bulk of Pragmatic
Currencies before writing Extend the Mint, and I obviously forgot to
update Pragmatic Currencies for that particular change.

BTW, Chuck, your rule change report listed the title of Rule 1736 as
"Injucntions on Payment Orders".  The Proposal read "Injunctions".  I
won't bother with a COE on this, but please check the Ruleset to make
sure it's correctly recorded.

I note that this is error; Proposal 3533 specified the Title
"Injunctions on Vacating Payment Orders" for this Rule.

This is not a COE; I don't want to force Chuck to post another
complete copy of the Ruleset merely to correct a single transposition
of no consequence.

Yes, he would.  The new Rules for COEs require that a _corrected
version_ of the document be posted when a claim is admitted.  It is no
longer sufficient to post a correction.
