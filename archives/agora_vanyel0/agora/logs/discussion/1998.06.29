It occurs to me that Agora is a far more ominous game than I thought... 
look at the combined size of the Full and Short Logical Rulesets.

First I quote from the Rules:

Rule 1596/3 (Power=1)
Payment Orders

      A Payment Order is an Order requiring an entity (the payor) to
      submit a Transfer Order transferring units of a Currency from
      itself to some other entity (the payee).  A Payment Order
      specifies exactly one source entity, exactly one destination
      entity, exactly one Currency, and a number of units of that
      Currency which is a positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ.
                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

IMO, this means that the attempt to issue a PO for .5 Indulgences failed,
unless one is going to argue that "a positive multiple" does not mean an
integer.  I interpret this as an integral multiple and therefore will consider
that this PO has not been issued.  Please submit a CFJ if you disagree.

In any case, macross's Indulgence transfer fails, either because the PO does
not exist, or because it is impossible to satisfy the PO for .5 Indulgences
with a transfer of 1 Indulgence, and therefore, per R1598, the transfer is
invalid.

for the Agoran Anthem.

>>>>
I love you Agora, by Vlad 1994(?).

Agora, the game without peer,
Chess and go, they aren't even near.
The strength of our game is the Rules,
The Players are nobody's fools,
Agora you're the only one for me!

[Chorus:]
Agora, the Nomic game
No two days are quite the same
All other pastimes put to shame
I love you, Agora!

Changing the Rules, that gives us our fun.
And in this respect, we're second to none.
Though CFJ's give us the aches,
We're Stoics and those are the breaks.
Agora you're the only one for me!

[Chorus]

When Chaos arrives, at the end of each May,
We beat it aside, in our own Nomic way.
When paradox looms so vast,
Remember our golden past,
Agora you're the only one for me!

[Chorus]

Every few days, we see a new Scam.
We take it in stride, and get out of the jam.
Though sometimes we get a big scare,
With Suber we haven't a care,
Agora you're the only one for me!
>>>>

Happy birthday Agora!

Ørjan.

I would rather state that the PO has been issued, but is invalid.

Fair enough.  A PO has been issued, but is invalid and therefore has no legal
significance wrt to compliance or reporting, i.e. the Herald will treat this PO
as if it had not been issued.

Happy birthday, Agora!

I feel that we need a flag to wave as we sing our glorious anthem.
Any suggestions for its design?

Sigh. I knew it would go like this. It's now nine o'clock in the
evening, and I still haven't got the parcel. Now I'll have to leave
(going to watch the football match with a few friends, including some
Dutch...) and I won't be back in time to pass the parcel on (unless
Murphy defaults, then I might just make it).

This is just to let you know that my inactivity won't be due to
disrespect for Agora's birthday.

Happy Birthday, Agora, anyway!

I think it should be white rectangle, with a lemniscate cut out of it. :)

Michael, I seem to recall that either Macross or Swann made a final
CFJ concerning the legality of Swann's Coup d'Etat and suibsequent events.
Was action ever taken on that CFJ?

I hope I will not have to do so. R1600:

Rule 1600/1 (Power=1)
Standard Mathematics

      Except where the Rules explicitly state otherwise, any
      mathematical term in the Rules shall be construed to have the
      definition usually given to it in standard mathematics.  In
      particular,  "number" shall mean  "real number."

Hence, "a number of units of that Currency" means "a real number
of units of that Currency".

Now, are you really going to force me to make a CFJ on this?

Good. But why aren't the POs which you issued included in the calculations
of the net POs of Players, or in the lists of outstanding POs, which both
follow this announcement?

I think a Judgement of FALSE is indicated. Macross can satisfy the PO
for 0.5 Indulgences naming him as Payor, by executing a Transfer
Order for 0.5 Indulgences from himself to the Bank. This will satisfy
the requirements of R1732. The key here is that R1732 does not require
that a transfer of 0.5 Indulgences actually be made, only that a Transfer
Order for that amount be successfully executed. R1577 (Minimum Unit
Quantities) will then act, in my view, to round the amount of the
transfer up to 1 Indulgence, for the reasons I have already stated
elsewhere, but this does not affect that successful execution of the
Transfer Order.

(Similarly, I believe that a TO for pi VTs could be satisfied by a
PO for pi VTs, which, when executed, would result in the transfer
of 3.1 VTs via the action of R1577.)

Well, I have the entry of POs, TOs and reports automated, so I created the Accountor report and then figured out
the tax.  I wanted to get it out, but was too busy to enter the POs and rerun the report before sending it.  If I have to
do a tax again, I'll try to include it in the body of the report next time.

I'll concent. But will Murphy? All he has to do is sit and wait
and he'll score 5 VTs.

Looks like one day *was* too short.  I'm easy.  I'll agree to whatever
changes you think appropriate.

The third pause in the Music was scheduled for 2pm, which was an
hour ago.
Murphy gets the contents of the third Layer too, which was 1.0 VT. But I
am tempted to call this game off, due to lack of participation. :(

If I can get the agreement of the other Contestants I'll change th
Regulations appropriately. What do other people think?
