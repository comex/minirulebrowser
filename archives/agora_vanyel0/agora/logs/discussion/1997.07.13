I think this, in part, goes to the idea that a low-Power Rule cannot
change the meaning of a high-Power Rule by redefining terms.  In this
case, however, we have a non-Rule (Morendil's message) redefining the
meaning of a term in a Power 1 Rule.

"The Rules may allow the creation of entities and the assignment of
properties to entities through procedures specified in the Rules.
However, if any entity thus created or property thus assigned
conflicts in any way with the Rules, including by giving an entity
defined directly by the Rules properties it would not otherwise have,
then the entity created by the Rules, and the properties assigned by
the Rules take precedence."

This sounds... rather inelegant. To be more precise, I certainly wouldn't be
able to read this without recalling exactly why it was enacted. :)

Why not just formalize the notion that we have now, but in nascent form, that
non-Rule instruments can under limited conditions have the same effects as
Rules - this goes for Currency-minting posts, but also, recalling a recent
discussion, for Proposals - and set up a framework which defines both what
kinds of instruments are allowed to do what kind of things, and the various
levels of precedence among these instruments ?

It seems to me that we'll have, sooner or later, to move away from the point
of view that we're most of us clinging to that all changes to the Game State
have to derive their authority, at the root, from the Rules... There's nothing
that inherently requires a monolithic Ruleset as the sole authority behind the
Game.

It is my opinion, and this may be similar to your own, that a Will is
a body of text, and as such is _not_ a Nomic Entity.  However, the
property of being a Will is a property held by that body of text, and
as such is a Nomic Property.

SLCs (including Wills) cannot be changed except in accordance with the
Rules because of Rule 1589, not because they are Nomic Entities.  The
Rules do not speak at all in the manner in which SLCs are created,
which tends to suggest that they are not Nomic Entities.

Proposals are odd because of the way Rule 1483 defines a Proposal;
Proposal are created by the Rules and are therefore Nomic Entities.
A body of text goes into making a Proposal, but that body of text is
not the Proposal (the Rule states that it becomes the Proposal).

Applications are not Nomic Entities, as they are not created by the
Rules.  In fact, for something to be an Application it must have been
created by a Player (Rule 1626).  Rule 1626 prohibits any change to an
Appliation after its creation, however.  (This should probably be
changed to "designation".)

Given these examples, I tend to believe that Transfer Orders and
Payment Orders, as Pragmatic Currencies would define them, are not
Nomic Entities.

And here. As I said, the Rules give Properties to Wills &c., but don't
actually create or define them.

Bzzzt yourself. As I said, if an Entity that is a body of text is not a Nomic
Entity, then the contents of that body of text are not a Nomic Property. So
Rule 1589 makes it _illegal_ to change an SLC, but it does not make it
_impossible_ - thus changing and SLC would a non-retractable illegal move,
like Electioneering. (There being no penalty for it, though, that would matter
little.)

That would work in much the same way that "A Player is a person", then - 
basically interpreting that to mean that a given person is granted the property 
of being a Player. But then, one of the consequences we drew from that 
interpretation was that Rule 116 allowed, and Rule 1011 did not deny, the 
possibility of any person's 'properties' not solely defined by the Rules to be 
changed as that person wishes.

But in that case, my argument stands - the contents of a body of text is not a
Nomic Property of that entity, and a Rule which attempts to make it illegal to
change a property that is not a Nomic property nevertheless cannot make it
impossible - thus the situation with respect to changing the text of a
Proposal, SLC or Application would be analogous to Electioneering.

Neither do the Rules state how an Office is created - is an Office not a Nomic
Entity ? Are not Indices ?

You haven't yet explained the fact that Applications, though they are not
"created" by the Rules, are nevertheless "destroyed" by the Rules. 

But, all in all, let's assume for a moment that you are right in believing that
the Entities that P/C would have created would _not_ have been Nomic Entities.
Currently, there _do_ however exist classes of Nomic Entities known as Orders,
Payment Orders, and Transfer Orders.

Given your reasoning above, it does not seem so far-fetched to assume that all
the new Rules will do is grant to those Entities, in addition to their other
Nomic Properties, the property of being associated with a given body of text.
If it is valid to interpret "An Application is a body of text" as meaning that
a given body of text can be granted the Nomic Property of being an Application,
then it must be valid to interpret "A Payment Order is a message such that XXX" 
as meaning only that Payment Orders must be associated with such texts.

And, anyway, the authorizing Rules for POs and TOs do _not_ designate them as
"messages" or "bodies of text". They state that "A Payment Order is an order
requiring etc." and "A Transfer Order is an order requiring etc.". The class
of Nomic Entities known as "Orders" currently has a definition different than
just "a message sent to a recordkeepor".

I do not make light of your argument that identity of names does not imply
identity of Entities; nor am I arguing for some form of name-magic in Agora,
whereby naming something with the same name as another gives it some voodoo
power over that other thing. All I'm saying is that as long as the Rules
created by P/C make sense if referring to the Currencies known as Orders,
Payment Orders and Transfer Orders, even if that was not the _intended_
implementation, then we have no choice but to play by those Rules.

Note too that there is ample precedent for units of Currencies that have
various properties in addition to just being units of a Currency; I refer,
specifically, to the Powers of old, where a given Power of Influence could be
created as a 3-Vote, a 4-Vote or a 5-Vote card. So there would be no problem
in, say, minting a new Payment Order for a given Currency with Player X as the
Payor and Player Y as the Payee.

CFJ 803

Caller: Zefram

Statement: The second clause of the second sentence of rule 1488/0 is
without legal effect.

Judge: Michael

============================================================

History:
  Called by Zefram Mon, 7 Aug 1995 11:51:20 BST
  Assigned to Michael Tue, 08 Aug 1995 19:59:53 -0500
  Judged FALSE by Michael Tue, 15 Aug 1995 11:17:50 BST

Effects of this CFJ (Scorekeepor, take note!):
  Michael gains 3 Points for timely Judgement.

============================================================

Arguments of Caller (Zefram):

The first sentence of rule 1488/0 states "Let there be an Entity known
as the Nomic Potato".  Note that there was already, prior to the
creation of this rule, an Entity known as "the Nomic Potato"; it is a
Contest, created on 1995-08-02, and its Contestmaster is Zefram.  Much
of rule 1488/0 is concerned with who shall possess the Nomic Potato,
and this does not conflict with any other rule, as no other rule states
anything about the possession of a Contest.

The second sentence of rule 1488/0 states "There is only one Potato
which cannot be destroyed".  This obviously refers to the Nomic Potato,
already referred to in the first sentence.  Rule 1011/0 requires that
there is only one Nomic Potato, because if there were more than one
then they would have the same name, violating that rule.  Rule 1488/0
therefore, despite the lack of a clarifying comma in that sentence,
states that the one Nomic Potato cannot be destroyed.

Rule 1446/3 states that a Contest can be dissolved under certain
circumstances, including "when there is no Contestmaster and no
provision for replacing em".  Regulation 2 of the Nomic Potato states
"The Contestmaster shall be Zefram, and may not be replaced.  The
Contestmaster may resign at any time by indicating eir intent to do so
to the Public Forum".  Thus rule 1446/3, applied to the Nomic Potato,
clearly indicates that it can be destroyed.

Rule 1446/3 states that the Nomic Potato can be destroyed, and rule
1488/0 states that it cannot.  They are in conflict, and 1446/3 takes
precedence by virtue of a lower number.  Hence, the Nomic Potato can be
destroyed, and the part of rule 1488/0 that says otherwise has no legal
power.

============================================================

Arguments of Judge (Michael):

Judgement:  FALSE

Argument:  This statement is one that attempts to use the prior
           existence of a Contest called the Nomic Potato to
invalidate the claim in 1488/0 that the Entity defined there can not
be destroyed.  This argument rests on the assumption that the Entity
defined in 1488/0 has the same name as the Contest, and so to avoid
conflict with 1011/0 must be the same Entity.  (Contests can be
dissolved so, if one accepts the reasoning thus far, the clause of
1488/0 in question is invalidated by reason of it conflicting with
1466/3 "Contests".)

I attack this claim by showing that the assumption about names is
false.  In particular, rule 1488/0 nowhere claims that the Entity in
question has 'Nomic Potato' as its name.  It merely states that it is
known as the 'Nomic Potato'.  There is a world of difference between
being known as something and actually being named something.

Now, one might claim that the Nomic Potato Contest is an Entity known
as the Nomic Potato.  This is true, but it does not necessarily follow
therefore that the 1488/0 Entity is the same one.  The use of "let" in
Agora is used in a creative role; it creates a fresh instance of some
type.  Note that if 1488/0 had tried to name its Entity, then it would
have failed because of 1011/0.  It would not have suddenly merged two
distinct Entities, simply because two rules (of lesser precedence than
1011/0, which has MI = 2) asserted that they had the same name.

This argument may seem pedantic and slightly unworthy, but I believe
it is cast at the appropriate level given the circumstances in which
this CFJ was called.

============================================================

Evidence provided by Caller (Zefram):

1. Rule 1011/0: Game Entities May Not Be Arbitrarily Changed
2. Rule 1446/3: Contests
3. Rule 1488/0: The Nomic Potato
4. Message creating the Nomic Potato

----------------------------------------

Rule 1011/0 (Semimutable, MI=2)
Game Entities May Not Be Arbitrarily Changed

      Any Entity which is created by the Nomic Rules, and which exists
      only within the context of Agora Nomic (such as Points, Votes,
      Currencies and any Official Records) may *not* be changed by any
      action other than those specified by the Rules.

      No two Nomic Entities (including Players) shall have the same
      name or nickname.
      (*Was: 450*)

History:
Created by Proposal 450, Sep. 10 1993
Amended by Proposal 1011, Sep. 5 1994
Mutated from MI=1 to MI=2 by Proposal 1593, Jun. 2 1995

----------------------------------------

Rule 1446/3 (Mutable, MI=1)
Contests

      A contest is a subgame of Agora Nomic, having its own Name,
      Entry Fee, Regulations, Contestmaster, and Contest Fund.

      It is created when a Player posts to the Public Forum an
      announcement of the contest, including the Name and Regulations.
      Participants in the subgame are called Contestants of that
      contest.  The player making the post becomes the Contestmaster.

      The Contestmaster for a given Contest is a Player who has
      responsibility for administering the subgame.  He reports all
      currency transfers taking place under the Regulations, is the
      Executor of the Contest Fund, and maintains the Regulations.

      The Contest Fund is a Treasury, as provided for in other Rules.
      The owner of this Treasury is the Contest, and the Executor of
      this Treasury is, at all times, the Contestmaster of the
      Contest.

      The Regulations specify the operation of the Contest.  All
      Contestants, and the Contestmaster, are bound by the Regulations
      except where these conflict with the Rules.  They may also
      specify:
        1. how a Contestmaster is replaced. However, no person may
           become Contestmaster without eir consent;
        2. how the Currencies in the Contest Fund shall be spent, so
           long as this does not conflict with the Rules;
        3. the amount of the Entry Fee for the Contest, in the form of
           units of one or more Currency;
        4. additional restrictions on Players to become Contestants, 
           and conditions under which Contestants cease to be
           Contestants;
        5. how the Regulations may be changed.  If they do not so 
           specify, the Regulations may not be changed. Whenever the 
           Regulations are changed, the Contestmaster must post the 
           new Regulations to the Public Forum, and no such change is
           effective until it is so posted;
        and
        6. how the Contest may be dissolved.

      A Player becomes a Contestant by notifying the Contestmaster and
      paying the prescribed Entry Fee to the Contest Fund.  A
      Contestant may quit a Contest at any time by so notifying the
      Contestmaster, or by so posting to the Public Forum.  A
      Contestmaster may resign at any time by posting a message to
      that effect to the Public Forum, at which time e ceases to be
      Contestmaster.

      A contest is dissolved when there is no Contestmaster and no
      provision for replacing em, or upon unanimous agreement of the
      Contestmaster and all Contestants, or as otherwise provided in
      the rules, or in the Regulations.  When this happens the Contest
      Fund is distributed as provided in the Regulations; if no
      provision is made the Fund is divided equally between the
      Contestants. 

      If the Contest Regulations require a transfer to be made, but
      the Contest Fund has insufficient currencies to permit that
      transfer to be made, sufficient currencies to cover the transfer
      shall be involuntarily transferred from the Contestmaster's
      Treasury to the Contest Fund.  The Contestmaster shall report
      this transfer to the appropriate Recordkeepors.

      No Blots shall be assigned by this Rule.

----------------------------------------

Rule 1488/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
The Nomic Potato

      Let there be an Entity known as the Nomic Potato.  There is only one
      Potato which cannot be destroyed.  The Potato can be possessed by
      any Agora Player who owns Extra Votes (EVs).  A Player with no EVs
      cannot possess the Potato, and if the Player possessing the Potato
      ever ceases to own EVs, e also loses possession of the Potato.

      If the Potato's possessor ceases to possess the Potato though
      ceasing to own EVs, or ceasing to be a Player, or in any other way
      not otherwise described by the Rules pertaining to the Nomic Potato,
      the possession of the Potato immediately passes to the Player who
      owns the greatest number of EVs.

      If more than one Player is tied for the greatest number of EVs, the
      Potato is transferred to the tied Player who:
	
	i) Has not previously possessed the Potato; providing all other
	   tied Players have previously possessed the Potato.

       ii) Has not possessed the Potato for the longest consecutive period
	   of time immediately prior to the Potato's transfer; providing
	   all other tied Players have previously possessed the Potato.

      iii) The tied Player randomly determined by the Assessor, provided
	   neither i) or ii) apply.

      As long as at least one Player owns EVs, the Potato is always in
      some Player's possession. The only time that the Potato is not
      possessed by a Player is when no Player owns EVs.

      The Assessor keeps track of who possesses the Potato.

Nope, that's not necessary.  Just as long as it's understood that
the action represents the desire of Morendil only, and not
necessarily any other Misanthropists.  (I missed the end of the

Except, perhaps, the social contract (which has been much discussed
on the Rishon mailing list of late).  When I joined the game, I
implicitly agreed to obey the Rules, in addition realizing the
Rules would change and agreeing to obey those changed Rules.
I did *not* agree to obey the First Declaration of Rights
and Obligations.  The Rules may require me to obey the FDRO,
in which case I must obey the FDRO in order to also obey
the Rules, but I fail to see how the FDRO can grant itself
de novo authority, without a similar implicit agreement of
all Players.

Well, yes. Same here, in fact. But given the slippery nature of "the Rules", 
it should certainly be possible to split them into multiple bodies of law. This 
could be achieved, for instance, by having a Power-4 Rule explicitly state that 
it constituted itself a separate body of law; that might go something like:

  Enact a Rule, with Power 4, reading thus :

      At the time this Rule is enacted, this paragraph shall become the initial 
      Article of the Agoran Constitution, which shall be a body of law separate 
      from the Rules. This paragraph shall be the Article numbered 0; any 
      further paragraphs in this Rule shall become a separate Article of the 
      Agoran Constitution, numbered I, II, III, IV, and continuing. Thereafter
      this Article shall be Repealed.

      The Articles of the Agoran Constitution shall at all times take 
      precedence over the Rules of Agora; Agora shall make no Rule that 
      attempts to restrict any of the rights, nor relax any of the 
      obligations, that are stated in the Agoran Constitution.

      Amendments to the Agoran Constitution may be adopted by an unanimous Vote 
      of the Players of Agora, and in no other manner.

      There shall be at all times one Player responsible for maintaining a 
      record of the text of the Constitution; if the Rules of Agora do not 
      impose this requirement on a particular Player, then whomever has been 
      Playing for the longest time shall be responsible for this task.

      <etc.>

Now, as long as such a Rule was Voted upon and adopted, it would certainly 
represent something that the Players had agreed upon, and thus, I believe, be 
effective in creating a body of law with the stated precedence over the Rules, 
and separate from them. That's the kind of thing I meant.

With the Constitution in place, there would be a way to fragment the Rules in 
as many distinct bodies of law as would be deemed useful, as well as granting 
other instruments the power to affect the Game State.

Let's call this Rule C.  Now while Rule C exists, the Constitution does take
precedence over the Rules, because Rule C says so.  (Assuming that Rule C
takes precedence over all other Rules, which is reasonable.)

Upon Rule C's repeal, I'm not certain that the precedence remains.

OTOH, consider Rule C':

     Upon the creation of this Rule, the following things occur, in this
     order:

     * The New Ruleset is created.
     * For each Rule in the Ruleset, an identical New Rule in the New
       Ruleset is created, except for <...>.
     * All Rules in the Ruleset are repealed, except for <...>.
     * The Ruleset's name is changed to "The Agoran Constitution".
     * The New Ruleset's name is changed to "The Ruleset".
     * This Rule is amended by deleting this paragraph.

     The Agoran Constitution shall at all times take precedence over the
     Ruleset; Agora shall make no Rule that attempts to restrict any of
     the rights, nor relax any of the obligations, that are stated in the
     Agoran Constitution.  Except for this restriction, the Ruleset has
     complete power over all aspects of the Gamestate.

But I never agreed to obey a Constitution.  I agreed to obey the
Rules.

Well, yes, it has *stated* precedence over the Rules inasmuch as it
itself states its precedence over the Rules, but that doesn't make it
so.  I can claim that my Decrees have precedence over the Rules,
but that doesn't mean that they do.

Well - not all of the Players here agreed to abide by the Initial Ruleset,
either. But anyway - what problem would there be in also agreeing to recognize
the Consitution as binding ? Not to mention that we'd be sealing this agreement 
via a (more or less) democratic Vote, which presumably is a stronger form of 
agreement than that which adopted the Initial Ruleset.

What if the Proposal was adopted unanimously, then ?

It's a Power-4 Rule, it can state anything it want and be effective. As long as 
you grant that a Power-4 Rule, by virtue of taking precedence over every other 
Rule, including Rule 101, can have whatever effect is stated therein upon the 
Game, why not creating a new body of law having authority over the Rules ?

Morendil did not say that the Notary can change a Player's Will. He said
that R1011 does not prevent the Notary from doing so. He may be correct
about that (I don't have an opinion yet) even if R1589 prevents the
Notary from changing a Player's Will.
