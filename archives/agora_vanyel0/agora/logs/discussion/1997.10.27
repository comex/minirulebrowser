Just don't like me, or do you have a reason for this?  And why twice --
I never advocated active opposition.

This sort of change is a bad idea.  The original purpose of Disinterested
Proposals was that the Proposer gains no benefit from the outcome of the
voting, to avoid people voting AGAINST Proposals merely to avoid the
Proposer receiving these benefits.  Translating "Interested Proposal"
to "Proposal" will reintroduce such influences, making Disinterested
Proposals necessary again.  You'll just have to repeal all the rewards
for Interested Proposals.

No.  It's an Infraction, not a Crime, and Blots for such a minor offence
would be excessive.

Might I suggest that the Proposal represents a fine solution to the
various problems with the current R1042, and is eminently derserving
of support from the electorate, even if it is not precisely to
Zefram's taste.

Proto-Proposal
Electioneering and the Public Voting Experiment

[Comment: it occurs to me that during the Public Voting Experiment,
we might as well allow the Assessor to publish summaries of everyone's
votes, since votes are being sent to the PF anyway. Am I right in
thinking that votes which have been sent to the PF have already been
disclosed in the sense of R1625, and that the Assessor cannot violate
that Rule by republishing them?]

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 452 be amended by replacing in it
the text which currently reads:

      This Rule shall in no way prohibit the Vote Collector from
      posting, at any time and to the Public Forum, a list of those
      Voting Entities which have already voted or declared that they
      are Present on a given Proposal, Election or Referendum, as
      long as e does not indicate specifically whether the Voting
      Entity has voted or declared Presence. Doing so is not a Crime,
      unless specified as such by another Rule.

with text which reads:

      This Rule shall in no way prohibit the Vote Collector from
      posting, at any time and to the Public Forum, a list of those
      Voting Entities which have already voted or declared that they
      are Present on a given Proposal, Election or Referendum. If a
      vote or declaration of Presence has already appeared in the
      Public Forum prior to the publication of such a list, then the
      Vote Collector is permitted to indicate how the Voting Entity
      has voted, or whether it has declared itself Present. Otherwise,
      the Vote Collector is prohibited from specifically indicating
      whether the Voting Entity has voted, or declared Presence. The
      publication of a list as described in this Rule is not a Crime,
      unless specified as such by another Rule.

I'm trying to think of a clearer way to express this. Suggestions
appreciated.

Why the paranoia, Zefram? The reasons for voting for P3578 are obvious:
it's a good Proposal.

>And why twice -- I never advocated active opposition.

Well, you didn't advocate voting against the Proposal, but it's
clear that you wish it to fail one way or another. If it looks like
Quorum is going to be met, you have given us good reason to believe
that an AGAINST vote might be organized. Which gives supporters of
the Proposal a good reason to make an early and emphatic statement
in support of it.
