The only reason I have not yet called for an Appeal of this CFJ is
that the Judgement has not yet been published.

I must have done something right (or, rather, wrong), as the above

Hm. R1564:

      In each case, the insistence of any three Players, posted in the
      Public Forum, shall initiate a particular appeal.

Doesn't saying anything about timing.

I'm reposting this first draft.

####
Proto-Proposal
Liberalize Annotations

WHEREAS it is desirable that Judicial decisions which set precedent
as to how Rules are to be interpreted in the future be incorporated
into the Ruleset as Annotations, so that they may be kept ever fresh
before us, even if these decisions did not result from a CFJ on Rule
Interpretation being Judged TRUE, be it hereby resolved that the
Title of Rule 789 be changed to "Annotating the Ruleset" and that the
Rule be amended to read:

      If a Judge of a CFJ is of the opinion that eir Judgement of
      that CFJ sets a precedent as to how a Rule is to be interpreted, 
      then e is permitted to issue an Injunction requiring the
      Rulekeepor to annotate the Rule. Such an Injunction is called
      an Injunction to Annotate. Once such an Injunction has taken
      effect and the Rule has been annotated, the annotation, while
      it exists, shall guide the application of that Rule.
  
      Similarly, if a Board of Appeals is unanimously of the opinion
      that its Judgement of an Appeal sets a precedent as to how a
      Rule is to be interpreted (that is, it is unanimous in its
      opinion as to what that precedent is), the Board is permitted
      to issue an Injunction to Annotate.

      To be legally binding upon the Rulekeepor, an Injunction to
      Annotate must include a copy of the Statement of the CFJ and
      indicate what the Judgement of the CFJ was.

      In addition, an Injunction to Annotate may include further 
      material explaining precisely how the Rule is to be interpreted
      and the Judge's reasons for favouring this interpretation.
      However, this further material is not to exceed 20 lines at 70
      characters per line. If it does, then the Injunction to
      Annotate is not binding upon the Rulekeepor, although the
      Rulekeepor is permitted to obey the Injunction should e choose
      to do so.
      
      If a Player believes that the circumstances leading to the
      Judgement no longer prevail, rendering the annotation
      inapplicable, e may submit a CFJ to that effect. If it is Judged
      TRUE, the annotation is removed. Furthermore, the Rulekeepor
      is permitted to remove annotations Without Objection.

####

In writing the above, certain questions have occurred to me:

1. How, precisely, does a Board of Appeals issue an Injunction? This
is not a problem I am creating, since Boards are already empowered
to make Injunctions by R663 and by other Rules. But the Rules are silent
concerning the mechanism for this. A natural idea is that Board use the
apparatus of Applications and Signatures, but this raises a new question,
namely:

2. Would it be desirable to undertake a more sweeping reform of the
Injunctive process, one which would see Injunctions become a special
case of Applications? R1628 gives quite general powers to Applications, 
so it appears they could be used for the purpose.

3. Do we need to worry about Injunctions to Annotate which are Appealed
more than 3 days after they are published by the CotC in the PF? (see
R1571) It seems these Injunctions have by then already taken effect
and guide the application of the Rule they annotate. What I'm concerned
to avoid is a situation in which an Appeal of an Injunction is denied
on the grounds that the very annotation whose status is in question
indicates that the Appeal should be denied. That's a denial of natural
justice in my view,

I've tightened things up a little. 'particular' in the second
paragraph has become 'another' so as to avoid a peculiar little
paradox that if a Player posts to the PF alleging that they 
themselves are Quiet, it follows that they both are and are not
Quiet. (This paradox also lurks in the current form of R1042.)

Also, I've removed any reference to 'Abandoning' as a state a Player
is in, preferring to talk directly about the deregistration of Absent
Players. This shortens the Rule.

####
Proto-Proposal
Straighten out Absence

[Comment: the terminology in R1042 has somehow gotten all twisted
up. I think this straightens it out.]

Be it hereby resolved that R1042 be amended to read:

      Each Player is exactly one of Active, Quiet or Absent. 
      Whenever a Player posts to the Public Forum, or a new Player
      registers, e becomes Active.

      If a Player posts to the Public Forum clearly identifying a
      another Active Player, and alleging that that Player is
      Quiet, then that Player becomes Quiet. If a Player has been
      Quiet continuously for two weeks, e becomes Absent.  If a
      Player has been On Hold continuously for sixty days, e becomes
      Absent.

      Any Player can cause an Absent Player to be deregistered by
      stating in the Public Forum that the Absent Player has
      Abandoned the game. The Registrar shall confirm or deny the
      legality of the deregistration in the Public Forum as soon
      as possible.

      If the Speaker Abandons the game, e commits the Class A
      Crime of Speaker Abandonment. E ceases to be Speaker, and the
      Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker.

I think it would be more correct to write "no majority of the Justices
agrees on what action to take," than to write "a majority of the Justices
does not agree on what action to take".

Please use a word other than 'Active', as 'Active' is already used in
the Ruleset in the meaning of 'Not on Hold'.

True. Although the actual definition of 'Active' as meaning 'not
On Hold' has gone missing from R1016, and should be replaced therein.
I'll adjust my proto to take care of of both matters.

Proto-Proposal
Straighten out Absence

This Proposal has an Adoption Index of 2.

[Comment: the terminology in R1042 has somehow gotten all twisted
up. I think this straightens it out. I've added a reporting requirement
for the Registrar. (Zefram?) I have also put the definition of Active
back in R1016 where it belongs.]

Be it hereby resolved that R1042 be amended to read:

      Each Player is either Here, Quiet or Absent. Whenever a
      Player posts to the Public Forum, or a new Player registers,
      that Player is Here.

      If a Player posts to the Public Forum clearly identifying a
      another Player who is Here, and alleging that that Player is
      Quiet, then that Player becomes Quiet. If a Player has been
      Quiet continuously for two weeks, e becomes Absent.  If a
      Player has been On Hold continuously for sixty days, e becomes
      Absent.

      Any Player can cause an Absent Player to be deregistered by
      stating in the Public Forum that the Absent Player has
      Abandoned the game. The Registrar shall confirm or deny the
      legality of the deregistration in the Public Forum as soon
      as possible.

      If the Speaker Abandons the game, e commits the Class A
      Crime of Speaker Abandonment. E ceases to be Speaker, and the
      Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker.

      The Registrar shall include in eir Report the most recent
      date on which each Player changed from being Here, Quiet or
      Absent to any of the others.

Be it further resolved that Rule 1016 be amended to read:

      At any time, each Player shall either be On Hold or Off Hold.
      This status shall not be changed except as specified in the
      Rules. For the purposes of the Rules, 'Active', 'not On Hold'
      and 'Off Hold' are all synonyms.  

      When a Player registers (or reregisters), e is Off Hold.

      An Active Player goes On Hold when e Moves to the Stasis
      Chamber.

      An On Hold Player becomes Active when e Moves from the Stasis
      Chamber.  E may not do so until at least 96 hours after e last
      went On Hold.

I think Rule 451 (Determination of Judgement - Timing) saves us here.

Um, an Absent Player can be Active - there is no connection between the
concepts. The term used in the Rule for what you are thinking of is "Not
Absent".

Greetings,

I think this should be reworded. "The Registrar shall confirm or deny
the legality of the deregistration..." sounds as if the deregistration
always take place, although sometimes illegally.

You're not really clear enough on the meaning of 'Abandoning the Game'.
Is it equivalent to being Absent? Or to being legally stated as being
Abandoned? Or to being deregistered as a consequence of the latter?

I disagree. The Rules do not define 'Active' at the moment, but
historically it has been taken to mean 'not On Hold'. One could argue
that it does not have that meaning anymore, but in that case there is no
clear other meaning it should have.

That state was there specifically to handle Speaker Abandonment, because
the Speaker can't be deregistered.

No.  Active is a synonym for Off Hold.

You left out Abandoning.  `Quiet' is a good term, but the use of `Active'
conflicts with its long-established synonymity with `Off Hold'.

No way.  You're giving the statement "X is Quiet" two meanings.

I have my own fix planned, watch for a proto...

Not only have I got a fix for 1042 planned, but also a revision of 1016
that would legislate the Active/Inactive terminology.  Please, therefore,
don't Propose your changes until you've seen my protos (probably to be

Actually it's not a paradox.  At the moment they would become Maybe

Hmm, interesting; even the provision specifying the default holder
of an Office to be the Speaker seems to lose the conflict with 790
in the case of a non-Player. Almost makes me wish I have definitely
been deregistered - I get to be the first non-Player Officer in
Agoran history ?

Further, as I read Rule 103, if a Speaker-Elect to Speaker transition 
were to take place, e.g. by Rebellion, I would become a Player again 
by virtue of becoming the Speaker. Veeery interesting. ;)

Anyone want to Rebel to provide a test of that ?

Am I the only one who has noticed that Morendil has occasionally used the
plural form "Injunctions" in situations where he clearly intended the
singular form "Injunction".  Since he issued these Injunctions, I have
noticed him  match up the plural form with singular verbs and with singular
pronouns.  While this could be an attempt by him to muddle the issue, I'm of
the opinion that this pattern of using the two interchangably should be
taken into account.  If it can be shown that this pattern existed prior to
the issuing of these Injunctions, then it could probably be argued that the
two forms are in fact synonymous when employed by Morendil.  I don't
necessarily agree with this conclusion, I'm just playing devil's advocate.

Quite frankly, I don't see how you can possibly read this as more than one
Injunction.  As I see it, the sentence is of the form: I hereby issue
Injunctions, applying to the Registrar, requiring em to X.  I cannot see how
the fact that X would require em to take an action for each Player can imply
more than one Injunction. The sentence does imply, ignoring for the moment
arguments such as the one I gave above, that there will be more than one
Injunction forthcoming, but I fail to see where it is.  Unless you mean that
this is more than one Injunction requiring em to do X?  In that case,
without anything that would indicate how many such Injuctions it is, I would
think that it would have to be assumed to be one.

Actually, it's not even relevant.  We have a known Officer, so the
default isn't required.

Almost certainly.  Actually, I think this is very similar to a scam you
attempted a while ago -- you noticed the same loophole, and attempted
to be Elected while On Hold.  The difference here is that you are
deregistered, and actually won an Election.

I was thinking about this yesterday, when I realised what had happened.
It's rather similar to our current EiP/Executor debate.  "the Speaker
is a Player" is different from "only a Player can be Speaker".
Without checking the Rules, I thought they made the latter statement,
preventing you from becoming Speaker, which would make Speaker Transition
rather tricky.  But on checking 103, I agree with you -- it in fact
makes the former statement, having the effect of reregistering you.
But wouldn't you immediately be hit with your 68 Blots again, and be
deregistered pretty quickly?

There's another aspect of this, which doesn't show up with Speaker-Elect
but could be a problem with other Offices.  Suppose you were Elected to
the Office of Assessor while deregistered.  The Rules would then require
you to make certain reports and so on, despite not being a Player.
Interpretation of Rule 113 becomes critical: its wording makes the (now
false) assumption that the Rules don't attempt to impose obligations on
non-Players.  Does that assumption become the meaning of 113, absolving
non-Players of any obligations the Rules might seek to impose?  On a
more mundane issue, a non-Player Officer would be immune to committing
Crimes and Infractions.

I did ? That's news to me... Do you have an example ?

That's basically my argument - and possibly, though it be expressed
in a form unacceptable to the Players who Appealed eir Judgement,
Vir's. Insofar as Rule 663 defines an Injunction such that some 
parsing of my post counts 4 Injunctions, I see no reason to count 45 
or however many the Justices counted, in much the same way that if a 
transfer or 4 VTs can count as satsifying two POs there is no reason 
to deny it that effect.

Even worse is the case of the Speaker going on Hold.  According to the
Rules, the "Player who is Speaker-Elect" becomes Speaker.  There is no
such Player.  (I suppose this means that the Speaker cannot presently
go on Hold.)

The same holds for replacing an Impossible Speaker.

In addition, a non-Player Speaker-Elect cannot become Speaker at the
change of quarter, for the same reason.

Ah, but the glory of having been the first non-Player to become

Yes, that ought to be fixed rapidly.

I think the consensus is that the Rule do not, because they cannot,
impose obligations on non-Players, because of the current
formulation of 101. On the other hand, were the Rules to impose an
obligation on a non-Player, there is no reason why that person could
not incur penalties etc., the only problem being that only penalties
applying to non-Players may be assessed against them. Ever since
Fugitive Blots (which by the way effectively doubles the number of
Blots I was putatively deregistered with when I register again,
making Lawlessness a particularly troublesome situation), we have
had non-Player penalties.

Quite. Maybe we should get rid of the Player/non-Player distinction.

This might be a job for the "person as Player" abstraction that I so lonesomely
defended in the past.  Let it be called an Estate not an Avatar.  8) (It really
wasn't an avatar when I was talking about it before either, although it could
be used as one).  Then when a person deregisters, eir assets do not need to be
transfered anywhere, the Estate is just legislated to remain a part of the game
until the Probate is completed.

This wouldn't be the case if the EiP's would get off their duffs and vacate the
POs the way they are supposed to before the person reregisters.  8)

That's not relevant - Fugitive Blots are assessed against Players 
when they deregister, the estate's financial situation does not 
impact these.

I was definitely not joking. Half tongue-in-cheek, maybe, but that 
distinction is already beginning to fade. I was thinking of a system 
in which anyone who posts anything to the PF is a Player, this being 
an irrevocable status, and deregistering makes you a Departed Player, 
which curtails most of your rights thereunder.

We've already blurred it somewhat in practice.  No one batted an eyelid
when Morendil issued a bunch of CFJs after being deregistered.

It's relevant in the sense that, if the PO's are vacated in a timely manner by
the EiP the way they are supposed to be, when a Lawless Player re-registers
after a month has gone by, e will re-enter the game with half the number of
Blots e had when e left, not double (or to be precise, one and a half) what e
had.

I would object to any Rule trying to impose any obligations on 
non-Players, in the same way I would object to a Rule stating that the 
cube root of 27 was 34.

Thus making Playership something akin to American citizenship (which
is irrevocable with very few exceptions, thanks to the Fourteenth
Amendment).

Fair enough, but what if all persons are Players?  (I'm not seriously
suggesting this -- this kind of extra-territoriality of laws is something
to which I strenuously object in real life, and I like R113.)  In any
case, there's nothing wrong with the Rules legally recognising non-Players
to a greater extent than they currently do.  We could rewrite most Rules
to refer to all people rather than just Players, and then just limit
things like Voting and holding Office to Players.

I believe Judge Vir erred in judging TRUE.  The use of the plural form
"Injuctions" or "Injunctions" presumes the existence of more than one; i.e.
we should it interpret it as referring to more than one unless contradicted
by evidence that only one action is specified.

Judge Vir apparently wants the presumption to go the other way, even more
strongly.  This is simply not what the words mean.

An argument has been made about the intent of the Judge in writing
"Injuctions."  The injunctions do not depend on the intent of the Judge,
but on what e wrote.

Regards,

I think the Rules have "access" to non-Players in a "read-only" sense. A 
Rule could use the status or action of a non-Player as the basis for a 
conditional decision, but it could not, for example, require President 
Clinton to declare Agora's birthday a national holiday. It is not merely 
that Clinton would be in violation of that Rule; in fact, the Rule (or 
that provision of the Rule) would have no effect at all. As much as we 
would like to think that all rules in Nomic are potentially mutable, we 
still have some unwritten metarules which "take precedence," so to speak. 
Steve discussed some of these in his essay on breaking the rules; I think 
this is another one.

(and many others expressed similar opinions).

I am surprized to see you all put so much emphasis on this plural. It
is perfectly clear that Morendil was not quite aware of what e was
doing when e issued these injunctions (otherwise e wouldn't have done
so, I assume). So everyone who discussed this so far claims to have
understood the status of thes wannabe injunctions better than Morendil
did at the time when e wrote them. So if Morendil was wrong about the
legal status of the injunctions, why should he not also have been
wrong about their number? 

Saying that each of Morendil's paragraphs contains several injunctions
just because Morendil used the plural would be equivalent to saying
that any injunctions are legal if they begin with the words "I hereby
issue the following, perfectly legal, injunctions".

I, for one, fully agree with Vir's reasoning and judgement.

I think this is actually a written metarule, in that it is a possible

Well, yes, but even if it weren't, or even if a rule *specifically* 
stated otherwise, I still think this "unwritten metarule" would take 
precedence.

Almost.  We claim to have a better interpretation than that which e
intended.  Game custom is that the intended meaning of any text is of
no consequence when interpreting it -- it must be evaluated as it stands.

No.  It is roughly analagous to saying that the paragraph's meaning
includes the Injunctions being legal if they begin with those words,
but in that case the sentence would be false.

The power of non-Players to issue CFJs has been established for a

I don't see the parallelism.  The latter is absurd, the former merely
objectionable.

I also think that it's not unreasonable for the Rules to place some
minimal obligations upon non-Players who choose to involve themselves
in the Game to a lesser extent than Playership.  It is untrue that the
Rules cannot place obligations on non-Players; what is true is that
the Rules lack the (legal) force to compel non-Players to abide by
those obligations, to the extent that it can Players.

Morendil's statement is ambiguous or conflicted.  It is generally
accepted that when construing ambiguous or conflicted statements,
especially when those statements have binding force, one should choose
the interpretation which preserves as much of the original statement
as possible.  Morendil used the plural in his statement of the
Injunctions.  In my opinion, interpreting them as singular, the use of
the plural notwithstanding, does not hew as close to the actual
wording as would any of the suggested plural findings.  Since it is
possible, and even plausible, to find a consistent interpretation in
which the plurality of statement is preserved without more worsely
abusing some other aspect of the statement, it is improper to ignore
the use of the plural.

Your analogy is inappropriate; in your analogy, there is no way to

The point is that he broke down the injunction into its required parts.  If
I started a sentence with "I hereby issue injunctions applying to all
players requiring that..." That is one injunction in my book.  Sure, I used
the word "injunctions", but I didn't specify how many.  I read that
sentence as meaning "I hereby issue injunctions, each applying to all
players requiring that..." and that the amount of injunctions wasn't
specified, so it is assumed to be one since only one is described.

It's a long time, but it's not a full year. CFJ 888 ("Non-Players may
make Calls for Judgement") was called 18 November 1996, and Judged 27

I'm curious about your repeated referrals to my attempted dismissal as a
Judgement.  It has always been my reading of the Rules that
a dismissal is not a Judgement.  Do you disagree, or is this just an
oversimplification on your part?

No, no.  I put emphasis on the plural because that is the meaning of the
word.  As I said, this meaning asks us to _PRESUME_ that there is more than
one Injunction, unless there is evidence to the contrary. (I am not
claiming that a legal presumption is an irrefutable legal proof. Your
example is not appropriate.)

As evidence of the number of Injunctions, I also note that Morendil claimed
authority to issue the Injunctions under Rule 1736, which begins:

Rule 1736/0 (Power=1)
Injunctions on Payment Orders

      The Rules may require, in certain cases, that a Judge issue an
      Injunction ordering the execution of a Payment Order.


The sorts of Injunctions described in Rule 1736 are all for a single
Payment Order.  There could not possibly be a single Injunction, "of the
sort described in Rule 1736" (legal or otherwise) that ordered the
execution of all the Payment Orders that he specifies.

Judge Morendil's statements "I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort
described in Rule 1736..." ought to be interpreted as one Injunction for
each Payment Order specified.

Regards,

Do I exist?  Well...  as a person, I definitely still exist.  As a
Player, that's another question.  Now that I'm in grad school, I find
myself devoid of time... I do still keep logs, and because I may or
may not still be Archivist I won't deregister out of hand.  But if I'm
called for Absence (surely I've been quiet long enough), I won't
object to being deregistered--that's why this is going to a-d, not
a-b.  I'll continue lurking and logging, mostly because there's no
reason not to. :)

I probably needn't say this, but you should probably cc any responses
to this mail directly to me...

I've continued to think about this. It seems to me that the Rules define 
a certain status of "playerhood," and even if someone does not qualify as 
a Player, their behaviour can still be regulated by the rules. But, 
*only* if they are "playing Nomic."

I'm making a distinction there between being a Player, as defined by the 
Rules, and being someone who IS playing Nomic. I still think the Rules 
have no power to place obligations on people who are not playing Nomic; 
and I think there is a sense in which Morendil *is* "playing Nomic."

Thus, none of the Injunctions could force more than one Player to issue
a Payment Order. This makes it certain that the first and third sets
of Injunctions contain at least 3 members - making the minimum number of
Injunctions 8.

The sorts of Injunctions described in Rule 1736 are all for a single
Payment Order.  There could not possibly be a single Injunction, "of the
sort described in Rule 1736" (legal or otherwise) that ordered the
execution of all the Payment Orders that he specifies.

Judge Morendil's statements "I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort
described in Rule 1736..." ought to be interpreted as one Injunction for
each Payment Order specified.
<<

Now _that's_ an argument I find easy to accept - I had not checked
1736 carefully, so I missed this point. But I think the validity of
this argument has nothing whatsoever to do with Morendil's use of the
plural "injunctions".

I don't know much about listserver software--is there some way
it can be set not to trap any messages to the lists (by s-bscribed
people) but to pass them all on?  These lists aren't like some, that
have people trying to s-bscribe and uns-bscribe every day,
and since the volume is alredy pretty high, I don't think
people would be bothered by the rare message set to
the wrong address.

Now, if you could find a way to bounce messages that should
be sent to the PF, but are sent to a-d by mistake, *that*
would be something. :)

I agree that Rules cannot impose obilgations on non-Players (although
even that depends quite critically on how you define "impose
obligations"), but I believe that as a gnereal meta-game
principle--I don't think 101 has anything to do with it.  R101
is silent on the issue of whether non-Players must obey the Rules.

Since the only effect of the Judgement will be to decide Morendil's
penalty, and since both interpretations are supportable, I think
the main consideration would be what penalty is appropriate for his
deeds. The use of the plural is hardly, by itself, diagnostic. One
could just as well say that Morendil was referring to all four
Injunctions, and repeating himself several times.

I note that virtually every Player has disagreed on exactly how many
Injunctions there are. Presumably this ought to be decided as some
point, in an official fashion?
