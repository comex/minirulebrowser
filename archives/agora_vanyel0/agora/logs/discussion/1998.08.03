I yearn for the return of Presence because it gives me a cheaper way to
support Proposals.  I dislike Secret Voting (especially without Presence)
because it increases the likelihood that I will waste a VT (already made
more valuable by scarceness) on a Proposal that fails due to Quorum.

I would rather save my VTs until there is a Proposal about which I have a
strong opinion.  By conserving my VTs I will be better able to turn the tide
on such a Proposal, both by Voting myself and by buying the Votes of others.

Not to the PF.  However, three people have already called for the
appeal of this CFJ (though not Oerjan) so it will go ahead anyway.

I think this ignores the data that are already in. The Proposals 'No
Presence' and 'A Secret Voting Experiment' were Proposals 3756 and 3757.
So results have been announced for 20 Proposals (3758-3777) since the
experiment with Secret Voting and no Presence began. I've compiled the
results for these 20 Proposals, and the 20 Proposals (3738-3757) which
preceded them, all of which were conducted in an environment of Public
Voting with Presence, and with 3 votes required to adopt a Proposal
(that change was introduced by P3721). The results are interesting:

Total VT expenditure 3758-3777: 68 VTs     9 PASS, 0 FAIL, 11 F/Q

The figures show firstly that the during the period of the experiment
with Secret Voting and no Presence there has actually been a small
contraction in VT expenditure. 75 VTs were spent on the last 20
Proposals with Public Voting and Presence, and then 68 VTs were spent on
the first 20 Proposals with Secret Voting and no Presence. Some of the
contraction in VT expenditure may be due to the incursions of scarcity:
when P3738 was adopted on May 3, there were 176 VTs in circulation; now
there are only about 110.

What the figures also show is that the experiment has had a marked
effect on the distribution of votes among Proposals. The effect of
raising Quorum from 3 to 5 has not been to encourage Players to spend
more to get Proposals passed, as I'd hoped it would be, but rather to
concentrate Players' VT expenditures on those Proposals with a chance of
passing. Thus we observe a near tripling in the number of Proposals
failing Quorum. As a result, many good and worthy Proposals have failed.
A number of people said that this was they thought would happen if
Proposals 3756 and 3757 were adopted, and they may now say 'I told you
so.' if they feel the need. At least we now have hard evidence to
support their skepticism in this regard.

Of course, we haven't tried the combination you suggest of Secret Voting
with Presence, but on the basis of these figures, I feel pretty
confident in predicting that it would not result in a significant
increase in VT expenditure. Rather, we could expect a return more or
less to the pattern of voting on Proposals 3738-3757, with about 3/4 of
Proposals passing with 3 or 4 votes for them and declarations of
Presence making up Quorum, and other 1/4 of Proposals failing Quorum.

I think a 2 month trial of obligatory voting is warranted. If it had the
effect of pushing VT expenditure up, to say, 90 VTs on the first 20
Proposals on which it's tried, I think it we could call it a success.

Thanks very much for this compilation, Steve! I must admit I am
surprized that the number of VTs spent without Presence is not
significantly lower than with Presence, although I would argue that
some of the VTs spent on the early no-presence proposals would not be
spent anymore now that people realized how difficult it is to see
low-profile uncontroversial proposals reach quorum.

But actually, the current situation, while different from what we're
used to, is even more interesting in many respects - it encourages
preparing and actively advertising proposals and makes even the
outcome of rather uncontroversial proposals an interesting issue.

Of course, there are more situations to explore, like the combination
of presence and secret voting (my guess is that this will be the most
interesting one), or different proposal batch sizes and their effect
on VT expenditure. 

Steve:
>> 
Thus we observe a near tripling in the number of Proposals failing
Quorum. As a result, many good and worthy Proposals have failed.  A
number of people said that this was they thought would happen if
Proposals 3756 and 3757 were adopted, and they may now say 'I told you
so.' if they feel the need.
<<

But even if they do say so, the effect itself is not necessarily a bad
thing... Frustrating to the proposer, yes, but still good nomicking
IMO.


>>
Of course, we haven't tried the combination you suggest of Secret Voting
with Presence, but on the basis of these figures, I feel pretty
confident in predicting that it would not result in a significant
increase in VT expenditure.
<<

Why not? The uncertainty about other players' votes would certainly
have some effect: on one hand, it encourages people to vote instead of
just declare presence to make sure the necessary three FOR-votes are
reached, on the other hand they'll be afraid to waste VTs on proposals
that may fail quorum (as now). Both effects would tend to encourage
people to publically debate their votes, publish eir own votes, ask
others about their plans etc, just as we saw recently.

At the moment I think obligatory voting would be a too heavy-handed
approach. Why not try the combination of Secret Voting with Presence
for some time?

There is also a less brutal way to require more FOR-votes, without so
many failed quorum cases, if we amend 955 to require at least four, or
five, FOR-votes instead of three. Note that, say, five FOR votes
required would not require five different voters - some players could
cast two or three FOR-votes, and group votes (which don't influence
quorum, and are consequently useless on uncontroversial low-interest
proposals at the moment) could make a real difference (this is
something I'd really love to see - some real effect of groups on the
essential gaming activities). I think that would be more enjoyable.

BUS: RE: Accountors Report for 01 August 1998

Because you specified that the TO should satisfy a PO that it could not
satisfy, the Rules prevent the TO from being effective.  Don't worry.

Oops, typo.  I transfer 1 VT to the Bank to satisfy VT2600, if it has not
already been satisfied.  Now is there a way to get those 2 VTs back?

I saw these as orders ready for execution, that once sent directly were
executed.  They are valid in content and form, but not yet in
effect--like a letter in transit, or a summons not yet served.

I agree that the current situation is quite interesting in its own
right. The difficulty of getting minor Proposals passed is inevitably
putting pressure on Proposers to change their practices, and we're
starting to see the first combined Proposals containing several
unrelated amendments. But it's taken quite a long time for these
pressures to build, and the experiment is nearly over, with little
prospect of the ban on Presence being extended. Secret Voting may
get an extension though (see below).

Well, OK, I'll give it a go if you will. At present, three Players,
myself included, have voted FOR P3780. I'll offer a VT to the next
Player to vote FOR it (Blob?), and you can buyback Quorum on it if
necessary.

Is it correct that presence will be reintroduced just one day before

Hard to say. It's been a while since I was very active on LambdaMOO.
I think "Petitions" can basically cover any aspect of the MOO, but they
are generally limited to a subset of issues regarding arbitration 
between MOOers, building quotas, etc. Also, I think the wizards have
veto power over anything that is impractical.

I've been considering running for Election.  Which Offices are easiest for
someone new to the task?  I notice that there hasn't exactly been a stampede
of Players nominating for Scorekeepor.  Would it be a good "entry level"
Office?

DIS: Which Offices are easiest?

I haven't been Scorekeepor, but it looks like an uncomplicated but possibly
time consuming task.  You've got to keep an eye out for all those score change
messages.  But at least it doesn't require having the added burden of tracking
TOs and POs.  Of course, Steve can give you the best idea about it. 8)

Yes. This means that if the Proposal passes, the ban on Presence will
be reinstated for a fresh 2 month period after a lapse of 1 day.

Blob, voting maybe free on InterNomic Proposals, but it is still Secret.
Therefore, you just committed Public Voting, which Kolja will have to

That's basically how Shattered World works as well, if I understand
Geoff correctly. It's an interesting problem, one which contributed to
the collapse of Nomic World: if all aspects of ther game can be
legislated, then what do you do when the legislators pass laws which
make work, maybe a lot of work, for the coders? On SW, the answer is
that game custom dictates that requirements to code are simply ignored
by the wizards, who put forward an analogy that says that the game
environment is like Nature. Passing a law which says "Gnomes shall be
plentiful, rich and easy to kill." doesn't make it so, anynore than
passing a law which says "The value of pi shall be 3." makes that so.

I think so. It's not quite as easy as Wizard, but it's still not
terribly complicated, like Accountor or Registrar.

Something about 1859 just hit me... Its first paragraph says,
essentially, that only messages that are sent privately to a Vote
Collector are Votes. Doesn't that mean that a message to the
PF can therefore not "contain Votes", and thus make its author
guilty of Public Voting ?

That's an interesting way of reading the Rule. Of course, one could
respond by saying that the context of the Rule means that the second
paragraph should be interpreted as referring to messages which
purport to contain votes - but notice that this still departs from our
current practice of counting public votes as votes.

Perhaps a CFJ is in order.

That's what i thought when I first read the rules after public voting
was mentioned after i became a player. It still seems to be what the
rules say, Anyone care to explain why i'm wrong here? I'd appreciate it.

I won't call it - I haven't been guilty of that particular offence. ;)
I'll leave that to Players who've been hit with it as a potential way

Read what he said.  "... I'll Vote FOR P3780".  I will Vote FOR
P3780.  Will.  Future tense.  Statement of intent.  I think you err in
interpreting this as a Vote.

Interesting.  In my rush to send my Vote earlier, I accidentally send it to
the PF, but, also in my rush, I choose a wording which could be construed to
not be an actual Vote.  Interesting.

While pondering how to get out of this I realized that "the casting of any
votes... may only be achieved by sending a message to the Vote Collector of
the Proposal, Election, or Referendum only."  Thus, I might be able to argue
that it isn't a vote.  But as you point out, the wording prevents it from
being a Vote at all.

Interestly, I came to the same conclusion myself after stating my intention
to Vote in the PF (thanks to the General for noticing that!).  The proof of
this idea is that a 'vote' in the PF is not counted because it was not sent
"to the Vote Collector of the Proposal, Election, or Referendum only."
