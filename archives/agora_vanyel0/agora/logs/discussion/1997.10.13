My initial reaction was different: the infection of R1458 does not
deprive R1601 of its effect of placing deregistered Players in Probate.
When R1458 is disinfected, the Speaker will be the Notary pro-tem,
and R1738's provision that entities in Probate without an EiP shall
be assigned one by the Notary will then come into play.

One *could* say that, if one were sufficiently perverse, but there is
no *need* to say, any more than we need to say adding zero once is
the same as adding it infinitely many times. Sure, the result is the
same, but think about it from the point of view, say, of the number
of machine code instructions it would take to perform the additions.

Having thought about it for a while, I have to admit that you
have an excellent point there.

Hey, I just noticed than in addition to Winning by Proposal when the
VP of P3548 concluded, I also Won by Insanity.

Darn, except that I didn't :( An Insane Proposal must be Interested,
and there have been no Interested Proposals (because there have been
no P-notes) since P3533 was adopted. Oh, well.

Paraphrasing Murphy slightly, R1738 can be read two ways:

(1) If you are the EiP of an Entity, then you are its Executor.
(2) If you are the Executor of an Entity, then you are its EiP.

Reactions: firstly, you seem to assume that one must be committed to
precisely one of these readings. I don't see that. My own view at 
present is that both readings are possible, at different times and
in different circumstances. Secondly, I don't see how the second
reading implies that EiPs are not a subset of Executors; it implies
they are not a *strict* subset, I grant you, but leaves open the
possibility that the sets are identical - far from being separate
things.

In fact, taking both readongs at once implies that the sets are
identical, and that therefore, everyone is indeed their own EiP.
This conclusion is not worrying, however, since most of us are
not in Probate.

Too complicated.  There are better ways to do this: perhaps establish

The Rules define the method of declaring Presence to be informing
the Assessor.  You're not required to act on such declarations, but as
Vote Collector I'd appreciate it if you'd inform me if you receive a
declaration that was not sent to the PF.

Yes.  When the Office starts to exist again, it will have no holder,

Please, no.  I do not wish for "Nomic Time" to become disassociated
from real time; this creates enormous complications for
Recordkeepors. 

I also doubt that your suggestion is, in practice, any less
complicated than either mine or Morendil's.

Because that Board wasn't asked to consider what criteria should be
considered when considering the appropriateness of an Injunction
with respect to R1695. Thus, the decision of any Judge asked to
consider them, and of any Board of Appeals reviewing that Judge's
decision, will carry more weight than the initial decision returned 
by this particular Board of Appeals.

In ordinary situations, Appeals of Injunctions, as well as Appeals of
Dismissals, should be routine, procedural decisions taking advantage
of well-established principles of determination and interpretation;
the reason for that being, in the first case, that it is easy for a
Judge to return a perfectly noncontroversial Judgement and a
controversial Injunction; and in the second case, that a Judge
dismissing a Judgement, and a Board of Appeal's overturning that
decision, are decisions unlikely to be strongly related to the
subject matter of the relevant Statement.

Thus, in both the above cases, the usual dialectic of Judgements and
Appeals of Judgements is not observed; there is no opportunity for 
one person to make a case and, if that person's arguments are found 
wanting by the Agoran community, having them reviewed by a wider 
panel.

I've already submitted the same argument concerning Vlad's dismissal
of CFJ whichever-it-was, in which e essentially argued that 'the
Rules have no agency'. I never saw any reason to regard Vlad's
decision as establishing a stronger precedent than already existed
to the contrary; but on the other hand it would have been pointless
to call for the Appeal of Vlad's dismissal, as the matter being
considered in a dismissal is, broadly, whether the Statement made any
sense in the context of Agora, and the Rules' agency or lack thereof
has strictly nothing to do with that.

> As for Rule 663, it was the Board's view that this Rule has minimal
> if any implications at all for the appropriateness of Injunctions

Actually, I agree with that - when I referred to 'the criteria
implied by 663' I think I meant 1695.

> legally, according to the Rules in a technical sense (ie in

Just as a matter of curiosity, you are of the opinion then that these 
Injunctions were in accordance with 1695 as far as these 'procedural' 
requirements were concerned ?

Not the way I envision it.  I think you are confusing the concept of
time with its representation.

All we need to do is define that, from the point of view of Nomic Time,
all times during a Holiday are equal, and that Nomic Time changes at the
same rate as real time at all other times.  We would in fact represent
times using the Gregorian Calendar etc., merely having to cope with the
idea that (for example) 1997-10-14T00:00:00Z == 1997-10-15T00:00:00Z,
and 1997-10-13T23:59:59Z/1997-10-15T00:00:01Z lasts 2 seconds instead
of 86402.

>I also doubt that your suggestion is, in practice, any less

I think Morendil's scheme is in practice very similar to what I suggest.
The only problem it has (which your scheme has to a greater degree) is
that it does admit that the time during a Holiday legally existed, and
was normal time, thus leaving open the possibility that the Rules might
refer to time in ways other than those anticipated by the Holiday Rule,
and thus make some things legally happen during the Holiday.  In a sense,
I am advocating a single case of global deeming (redefining time, which
is really the effect we want) rather than multiple smaller global deems
(extending time periods, etc.).

I don't like that either.  We lose the ability to order events which
take place during a Holiday.  This goes far further than what I
propose.  I don't want Holidays to be "black holes"; I want them to
be, well, holidays.

Not if we word it right.  The "simultaneous but ordered" paradigm would
work well here; alternatively, we say that the real time of the holiday
is compressed into an infinitesemal amount of Nomic Time, preserving
temporal separation.  It could even be done finitely, if infinitesemals
are undesirable -- compressing an eight-day period into one day of Nomic
time would work out pretty well, given a couple of auxilliary definitions.

OK, we've got different ideas of what a Holiday should be.  I still
maintain that completely dropping the segment of time is the simplest
way to make the Holiday have every required effect, even if it does more
than you want.

I specifically want it to be possible for a Rule to mandate that
certain things be done during Holidays.  (The Birthday Rule comes to
mind.)  Also, certain high-priority things should disregard Holidays.

Since I always process Offices in alphabetical order, Ambassador Morendil
will be first against the wall.  All in all, you're just another brick

Actually, Speaker Steve is the first one against the wall, as I read

Here's my attempt at one:

It would be natural for R1738 to make both Statement 1 and Statement 2, if
R1738 were defining what EiP is.  But it isn't; EiP is already defined in
other Rules.  The natural and intended reading of R1738, AFAIK, is to make
Statement 1 alone:  "X's EiP becomes X's Executor", not vice versa.

Shouldn't that be "midnight GMT of the first day of the Holiday until
midnight GMT of the day immediately following the last day of the Holiday"?

What if the period of time would begin during the Holiday?  Or begin
during it and end after it?

The Speaker is not supposed to be CotC anyway.  I suppose you could
punt to the Justiciar, but if we're at the point that the Speaker is
the CotC and is further failing to perform eir various duties, that
Speaker is probably Psychotic, and we have more serious problems than
merely finishing Probate in a timely manner.

Dropping the time segment completely makes it difficult, even impossible,
to know what to say about events which do happen during the Holiday.
Or are you going to make all such events take effect when the Holiday is
over? No, I don't like it.

I don't think Kolja's Rebellion actually has triggerred a Revolt.
The last Registrar's Report has 20 Registered Players and 5 Rebels,
with 7 required for a Revolt.

Why don't you just say that all mail sent to the PF takes effect during
the holiday, but any requirements that need to be fulfilled by a time which
falls during a holiday instead needs to be fulfilled within 24 hours of the
end of the holiday... that seems to me to be the easiest way to put it, and
if I'm correct, the way it was in the original proto, no?

Right.  I don't want time mutated during Holidays; I just want
obligations held in abeyance or delayed for the duration of the
Holiday.

My analysis: Antimatter is registered, and Harlequin is eir Executor.
I take R1478's statement that "Except when the Rules stipulate
otherwise, a Player is eir own Executor." to mean that when the Rules
*do* stipulate otherwise, as in this case, a Player is *not* eir own
Executor. I think it's but a small step from there to the conclusion
that Harlequin, and he alone, is the entity empowered to act on behalf
of Antimatter, as if e were Antimatter. I conclude that the Registrar
should note Antimatter's change of address, Antimatter's protests to the
contrary notwithstanding.

I tend to agree, but it probably makes sense to upmutate R1467 to
Power = 2.

There is a further problem.  It is painfully obvious that Antimatter's
address is not harlequin@tmbg.org.  I am seriously suspicious that
Harlequin committed a TIA offense by requesting the Registrar change
Antimatter's address to an address that is clearly not correct.

Please don't.  Rule 1467 needs rewriting, and upmutating it will just
make that harder.

This is an absurdly narrow conception of what a Judge or Board of
Appeal is permitted to consider. According to this conception, a
Judge who is asked to consider whether a Player broke a Rule
oversteps eir authority if e dares to go so far as to consider the
meaning of the Rule allegedly broken! Even if the utter absurdity
of such a claim were not immediately evident, it would suffice to
point out that it is totally contrary to game custom.

Consider the recent CFJ concerning whether G. Chaos committed the
Infraction of Wrongful COE Denial. A judge attempting to determine
to trieth of this Statement has to look firstly at the definition
of this Infraction in R1431. There, it is stated that:

      A Player who incorrectly issues a denial of a Claim
      commits the Crime of Wrongful COE Denial, a Class 1 Crime...

Judge Michael determined that G. Chaos had incorrectly issued such
a denial, and so Judged the CFJ TRUE. (As it turns out, this
Judgement was overturned on Appeal for reasons that are irrelevant
here.) If G. Chaos were to argue as you are arguing now, he would
be saying that Judge Michael overstepped his authority as Judge
in attempting to determine whether G. Chaos incorrectly issued a
denial of a Claim, since he was asked only to Judge whether G.
Chaos had committed the Infraction of Wrongful Denial, and not to
rule on the meaning of R1431. Do you think it would be reasonable
for G. Chaos to insist on an additional CFJ ruling on the meaning of
R1431? Without a good reason to think the Judge Michael simply got
it wrong about the meaning of R1431, what can possibly be the point
of such an additional ruling? Judge Michael's ruling just *is* a
ruling on the meaning of R1431, and if there are no objections to the
substantial correctness of the ruling, there can be no point in
questioning whether Judge Michael had the authority to make such a
ruling.

Returning to the present case, my point is this: if you think that
Board simply misinterpreted R1695, then by all means you are welcome
to pursue that through the Courts. I'm confident that future Judges
and Appeal Boards will support our decision as correct in law,
especially as you have advanced no arguments of any kind that our
interpretation of R1695 was mistaken. You seem instead to be arguing,
not that the Board misinterpreted R1695, but that the Board had no
authority to interpret R1695 in any way at all. That's simply
ridiculous, and it would be an irritating waste of everybody's time
for you to pursue that through the Courts, in the absence of any
reason to think that our interpretation was mistaken. If you can
produce plausible reasons to doubt the correctness of our
interpretation, then, please, let's see them. If not, the it's time
to accept the umpire's decision and move on.

>Just as a matter of curiosity, you are of the opinion then that these 
>Injunctions were in accordance with 1695 as far as these 'procedural'

I haven't reached a firm conclusion about that. My initial feeling 
is that they are legal, but I'd need to study closely Jeff's argument
to the contrary before coming to a definite conclusion.
