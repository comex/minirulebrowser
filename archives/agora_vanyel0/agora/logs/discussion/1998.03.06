Please note that the scam Proposal very carefully and strictly
limits what Power 4 instruments the Threat Vizier can create.
Essentially, all we'll be able to do is leave the Monument in
the Ruleset, and that's it. Finito. I hope this allays your
suspicions. I mean, really, if this were a naked grab for power,
don't you think we would have used the instrument loophole to
install ourselves as the absolute authority in the game, which
we could have done? Does it mean nothing to you at all that we
chose not to do this?

Secondly, it meaks a big difference to *me* whether I'm retired 
from Office as part of general Revolt, or summarily removed
from it in disgrace as a result of being impeached. Impeachment
is a very serious matter.

Finally, if impeaching me would impede the scam in some way then
I would accept it, the above concerns notwithstanding. But it will
have no effect on the scam whatsoever. The Referenda will not
conclude until more than 2 days after the Voting Period on P3710
has concluded. Attempts to defeat the scam are welcome and I
encourage them. But punishment for having executed a scam is, I
think, another matter altogether.

I appreciate your forbearance, and your willingness to hear arguments.
Some of the other Players appear to have adopted a 'shoot first and
answer questions later' approach.

I think that once the amendments to the Queue have passed, Proposals
will not be Numbered until they are distributed. In that case, I
believe it would make sense to list them in the Queue in order of
Priority.

Thanks.  You will note that I do not consider P3710 in itself
sufficient cause to vote FOR these Referenda--any attempts
to get me to vote FOR will have to provide reasons beyond that.

But that assumes that the Players divide politically into the
Officers and the non-Officers. In general that is not the case.
Rather, one tends to find shifting alliances of Officer and non-
Officers working against other shifting alliances of other Officers
and non-Officers.

The fact that the Rule changes are short does not mean that they are
not profound. Witness public voting.

I would be making exactly the same arguments if I held not a single
Office. Indeed, I will continue to make these same arguments through
the coming Revolt, even though I do not expect retain any Office that
I hold as a result of it.

I would support some kind of attempt to make P-Notes scarce, although
the matter is not as urgent as it was for VTs. There are less P-Notes
in circulation, very few entering, and substantial numbers leaving.
So even if no steps in that direction are taken, scarcity should assert
itself soon enough. I should, though, check the last few P-Note Reports
to get a better idea of how matters lie.

But it's interesting to note, isn't it, that as soon as Offices
reached their current levels of reward, we suddenly saw a whole set
of really tough Elections. This makes me think that Offices have just
now for the first time reached something like their appropriate level
of reward. I think it would be a mistake to step back from that, at
least so soon.

No, but at least apologising for the work caused would have been
nice.  I didn't necessarily want to be inducted into the mysteries of
the scam.

At the time, the Assessor was paid twice as much for their job as the
Registrar.  An Election also combines aspects of the Promotor's and
Assessor's job inasmuch as you have to deal with nominations (the
whole process lasts a minimum of two weeks).  In any case, the issue
is not so much one of absolute work-load as one of relative work-load.

I don't remember the occasion in question, but did the situation
change from one of having two Rebellious players to having six, all at
once?  Was the situation an obvious setup for a scam?  Was a little
clique of Players simultaneously attempting to avoid the election
process altogether?

I actually wrote: 
  I make this transfer from Steve because he and his cohorts' little
  loophole exploitation is going to cause me a lot of work for little
  point.  Sure Steve gets to be Speaker and they hold onto their
  offices, but most Elections tend to be won by incumbents who bother
  to stand anyway.  Unless my interpretation of the rules is wrong,
  they have also fouled up in their attempt to hold on to the CotC
  job, and I encourage someone not of the Threat to stand in the
  election for this post.

I'm pleased that I checked my mail archive, because I wouldn't like to
think that I wrote "little cohorts" nor "grubby".  There doesn't seem
anything particularly derisive in that initial Kudo transfer.  I was
wrong to say that there was 'little point' to it, but I only know that
in retrospect.

My second transfer, in response to your transfer away from me, was
accompanied by the following:

I stand behind what I wrote.  You were Rebelling to achieve exactly
what I said you were doing.  

> Can you understand why I find that characterization of my motives
> upsetting?

I still maintain that dumping unusual/unexpected work-loads on
Officers for the purpose of scams is unethical.  It seems to me that
you had such a wonderful scam (and you have executed it extremely
well), that other people's reactions were always going to be a
secondary concern.  

You've handled the proposal making stage of things very well.  Putting
a special commemmorative rule into the ruleset is perhaps a bit naff,
but I agree that Impeachment and cries of "power-grabbing" from others
have been an over-reaction.

Michael.

That would have the peculiar effect of making 1 month after January 31

Listening to elJefe's attack on the proposed Impeachments, I was
reminded faintly of Cicero, whom I've been studying of late.  I will
now attempt a counter-attack, which will retain none of the vipid
language or unfounded attacks (show me, for example, where I called
him or anyone "suspicious").

Consider, first, what will happen if the Impeachments do not pass.  On
the one hand, a Rebellion might occur, removing from Office several
people (such as Ambassador Kolja A.) who were only elected to Office
in the last week or two, having in addition been removed from Office
two weeks before that in the last Rebellion.  On the other hand, if
the Rebellion does not occur, nearly all of the Offices will be held
by the few members of the Threat, adding further imbalance to the VT
distribution and such.

If, however, you and a few others vote for the Impeachments, we will
be able to avoid the complete deposition of all non-Threat Players in
Office.  We will be able to hold less Elections and keep people like
yourself and Kolja A. in office.

It is thus in this spirit that I ask you to vote FOR all Impeachments,
except in the unfortunate case of Michael.

Peace!

Personally, I think you need a better reason for impeachment than the
membership in the Threat.  I will not claim that my conduct as
Chancellor or Assessor has been wholly without error, but I believe
you demean the contribution that I and my fellows have made to the
Game through the largely thankless devotion to duty of Office over the
past months and years.

I might also point out that I was elected Assessor by acclamation, and
in fact have been thus elected in every Assessor election to date.
(The Assessorship has never been contested.)  In the one Assessor
election in the past several months in which I did not Nominate, no
one Nominated, and the Election had to be re-held.  (My Nomination was
withheld in protest.)  The Electorate appears to be historically quite
satisfied with my service as Assessor, and I don't think that recent
events present sufficient (or even plausible) grounds to justify my
impeachment from that Office.

As far as the Office of Chancellor goes, I do not believe my conduct
in that Office is subject to any great deal of challenge either.  It
is true that I am the only Player to serve as Chancellor (except for a
brief period of delegation some weeks back).  However, I have not in
any way abused the powers of that Office in any manner which would
justify impeachment.

In fact, my history of an Officer of Agora is remarkably free of
incidents of misconduct.

As a final point, should you manage to unseat the Threat through
Impeachment, the Threat is almost certainly able to produce a
Rebellion should we desire it.  After all, it only takes 6 Players to
foment a Rebellion, so we would only need to find two other rebellious
miscreants in order to accomplish such a nefarious task.  I therefore
submit that Impeaching us to save a Rebellion is a foolish and futile
effort.

Finally, I point out that should we all be Impeached, all of our
Offices would devolve immediately onto Speaker Steve, who is himself a
Threat.

I don't recall whether I have done so (and if not I realize that this is a

What you're trying to do is to hold your chosen clique in Office while
forcing elections for everyone else.  I see no honour in this, and it will
not work anyway.

I don't want to enter into any discussion of whether Impeachment is
an acceptable move under the circumstances or not, mostly because
I'm still working out an opinion in the matter; but the fact is that
the Referendum has been called, and a more fun and interesting 
things might come out of it.

Take the impeachment of the Speaker-Elect. Rule 1647 says the
Speaker cannot be S-E. Rule 1555 says e can. The latter wins the
conflict. Just a dull conflict situation which the precedence Rules
handle quite well so far. But then, there is a chance that a Revolt
might occur shortly afterwards; Rule 1664 then triggers a Speaker
Transition. Rule 402 goes into a lovely dance with Speaker Steve
ceasing to be the Speaker while Speaker-Elect Steve becomes the
Speaker, after having performed a ceremonial handshake even more
useless than usual with emself -  surviving the Revolt but becoming
Tainted in the process, triggering one more Election.

Now who wouldn't want to see such a thing, for the sheer silliness of 
it ? I for one woud love to, which is why I chose to vote FOR in this 
Referendum - the only one in which at this time I care to do so - and 
invite everyone who likes Silly Walks to do so as well.

One wonders if the anti-Threats intend to apologize for all the extra
work they are about to create; the Registrar will be holding any
number of new Elections in the weeks to come.

I'm not sure I know who you are referring to; and I'm not sure you do
yourself. One Player called for a number of Impeachment Referenda;
some appear to support this, totally or (as in my case) partially.
Others (me among them) have Rebelled, but I don't think the reasons
for doing so were in any way related. Lastly, some have called for
uniting against the Threat (I am, coincidentally, also in that
number) but that is perfectly understandable, in Game terms, as a
compliment to your admittedly brilliant moves.

In short, I think that in lumping a very diverse set of Players into
a supposed 'anti-Threat' faction and laying some blame at their
collective door, you're lapsing into the same content-free rethoric 
that you so deplore in others.

Hm, I don't recall saying anything about what I do or do not
deplore.  And I believe my response is along the lines of "turning the
argument back upon its maker", which is a generally accepted method.

Well - my own overgeneralization; 'you' in the collective rather than 
in the individual sense. I will readily grant that the above was 
possibly the first non-factual comment you yourself submitted.

Doesn't apply here, IMHO. There's some of difference between
conspiring to bring about chaos, and reacting to chaos by creating
more of it. The problem with Scams is that they are enjoyable, but
also inherently disruptive of 'normal' game play. Thus the tradition
that Michael mentions, of perpetrators giving Officers a chance to
get ready. But I would agree that in some cases you can't make an
omelette without breaking eggs...

On the other hand, whenever a Scam is in progress, people on the
outside will naturally overreact. There's a feeling of urgency - in
the present instance, a justified one, given the Proposal's shortened
VP - that incites Players to try just about anything they can think 
of - usually making things worse. ;) And of course some of that may 
be tactical - adding to the confusion increases the chance that the 
perpetrators will fail to see a potential counter move.

Some of the arguments that inevitably ensue are also, in their own
way, a lot of fun - up to a point. I'd rate the current temperature 
of the debate at about 2 on a scale of 1 to 5. ;)

I've been sitting back, watching the discussion on this, and I've
noted that there seems to be an odd dissonance in the moral
color people are casting on the recent calls for impeachment.

Consider the following; we have three mechanisms for forcing
officer elections.  The Speaker can call elections by fiat once
in eir term and I have never heard anyone disparage the use of this
power, or call it dishonorable.  It is obviously a tool for the
Speaker's political power, and I doubt anyone feels put out if the
Speaker uses it for such, in an attempt to put eir "party" in power, or
to keep the opposition from gaining too much control (as Morendil did
this past revolt)

The next method is the all-or-nothing Revolt.  This too is a mechanism
of political power, or anti-power ;)  Again, there seems to be little
objection to the process itself.  I haven't seen anyone imply that
revolts are nasty or dishonorable, only that they may be too easy.

Then we come to Impeachment, which mechanically is little different than
a Speaker's call for elections-- except there has to be two elections,
one a majority vote to see if the Office will indeed be up for
election.  On the level of political weight, this has to be the least of
the three since it requires a successful referendum to have any effect
at all.  Why should this inspire such loathing, while the prior two are
considered in such a different light?

I think I have an answer, and a possible fix.

The reason people take Impeachment personally is because, of the three,
it _is_ personal.  The call for elections and revolts both refer to
Offices.  Impeachment refers to the Player holding the Office.  Even the
name of the process has the connotation of wrongdoing, or at least
ill-will toward the Officer, in what should be able to be simply a
tactical move.

So here's a suggested fix; replace Impeachment with a Public Call for
election, where a Player can call for a referendum to declare that a
given Office be declared to be held temporarily.

While we're at it, maybe we should replace the term "Tainted Speaker"
with something more neutral, like "Transitional Speaker."

my 2 cents
