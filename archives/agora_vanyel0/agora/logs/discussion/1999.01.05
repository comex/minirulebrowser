Now that judge selection has been deregulated, I put the question to
Steve, in his role as Clerk of the Courts: How do you plan to select
judges for upcoming CFJs?

I note that this report was both issued unofficially (Crito was no
longer my Executor when he issued it) and contains errors. Crito 
forgot to do the monthly adjustment of Priorities. I will issue a

I'll repeat the comment I made when Steve protoed Actions Without
N Objections, that these could both be incorporated into a
generalization of Applications.  (I'll write it up myself,

Well, I originally intended for the two changes to go together, the
second one to act as some kind of check on the first, to stop the CotC
from always choosing the same subset of judges. But I realised that 
they could happily sit as two separate Proposals, and that some people
might support one and not the other, so I made them separately.

I advocate P3822 to act as a check on gross abuse of the CotC's 
ability to select judges. There is still room for strategic selection
on eir part - selecting the appropriate Judge for the appropriate CFJ.
In fact, if I were CotC, I would enjoy the challenge of selecting the
right judge, knowing that I can't use em again later, and that something
more critical might come along later.

While checking the list of subscribers to each of the gecko lists in an
attempt to sort out some of my ongoing mail delivery problems (I am
intermittently failing to receive messages from all three lists), I
noticed that only the agora-official list had the findmail archives
listed as a subscriber. I realized that this must be why the discussion
and business lists have not been being archived. The problem is now
fixed, and all three lists are being archived at findmail.com (actually,
eGroups.com).

Now, if I could just sort out my own problems...

In my Budget, each player gets an amount proportional to the combined
salaries for the offices e has been holding for the last month.

Now that the findmail archives are all working for the gecko lists, it
occurs to me that the backup lists ought similarly to be archived.
eGroups.com provide some nice facilities, like sorting posts by name or
by Subject.

There are two ways we could do this. Consistent with the idea that the
backup lists are also Public Fora, we could simply direct traffic on the
backup lists to the agora-business archive, by subscribing the address
<listsaver-of-agora-business@findmail.com> to the backup lists at win
and yoyo. (Actually, would that work? I'm not completely certain...) Or
we could create separate archive facilities at eGroups.com for the
backup lists. 

What do people think?

This is somewhat interesting, but I think it needs more thought. There
appears to be no way for a Zombie ever to be deregistered, which means
that over time the operation of this Rule will result in a plethora of
Zombies in the game. This may have the unpleasant effect of raising
Quorum. More seriously, no provision has been made for Zombification of
Officers. I wouldn't want to see Offices held by Zombies, since during
periods when they were owned by the Bank, services would be disrupted.
Even if a Zombie Officer was owned by a Player, it's not clear that the
owner would be required to do any of the things the Zombie is required
to do.

A Zombie can be deregistered in the smae way that any other player 
can be deregistered. E can go of eir own free will, or e can be 
forced out by becoming Lawless. I think I'll also add a clause that
says if there is no winner in a Zombie Auction, the Zombie is 
deregistered, rather than having them hang around in the bank for
all eternity.

As long as they are in the hands of players, who can use them to Vote,
I don't see this as such a problem. Admittedly, a lot of unwanted
Zombies in the Bank would be a problem, but that can be fixed, as above.

Good point. We certainly would want to forbid Zombies from holding
Office, and remove them from any they hold. I'll make appropriate 
changes in the next release.
