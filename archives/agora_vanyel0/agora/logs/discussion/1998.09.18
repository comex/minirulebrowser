But the TO continues to exist, doesn't it? So, if at a later date it
would no longer result in a negative result, isn't the RK required to
abide by it?

Re: DIS: Re: OFF: CFJ 1107 (assigned to Blob)

The point is that "except for those transfers which would result in an
entity possessing a negative quantity of Currency." has the implied and natural
meaning of "except for those...*at the time of the transfer*".  Since the time
of the transfer is constrained by R1819 to be at a particular time, it doesn't
matter what happens to a Player's currency holdings in the future.  There is no
time in the future at which the TO in question would *not* result in a negative
holding at the time of the transfer.  Therefore the Recordkeepor is *never*
required to abide by such a TO.  Like Steve, I don't really see this as a
conflict, but as a set of constraints that taken together allow a Recordkeepor
to indefinitely ignore certain kinds of TOs.
