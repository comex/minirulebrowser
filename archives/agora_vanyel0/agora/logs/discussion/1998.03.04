Did the message submitting this proposal explicitly state that it was
to be an Urgent Proposal?  The Proposal Queue report Blob posted
didn't say so...

The requirement is that the message submitting the Proposal state so,
not the Proposal itself, or any posting of the Proposal Queue.

I realise this.  It is this that means we do not have any documentary
evidence as to whether or not the proposal submission message had the
correct annotation, and this makes it difficult for anyone but the
Promotor to confirm that there hasn't been a mistake made.  So, not
being able to do so myself, I am asking the Promotor to check their
records.

Of course,I was wondering mainly because of elJefe's post, which seemed to
suggest that the Scam proposal be made Urgent after its submission,
which is impossible, but which might have been overlooked.

Michael.

All right, time to explain myself.  I was hoping that by impeaching
the Threat Officers we might be able to avoid the Rebellion on the
13th.  Thus the non-Threat Officers would not be kicked out of Office
only two weeks after their entry.  Does that make any sense?

On a different note, the Rules really have to define the word
"impeach"?  They don't define "the", but we all accept its uage in
every Proposal.  I guess there might be some distinction, but
still....

I was going to comment on an error in the Journal, but since you have
posted it in such a way that I cannot quote it at all, you'll just have to
find the error yourself.

(Yes, it is a bug in pine that ignores Content-disposition when a filename
is provided.  I am _still_ annoyed.)

Greetings,

Actually, the Content-disposition for the Journal was "attachment", so
it was not pine's fault this time.

My post was based on misinformation. I didn't realize that Swann had
already paid the Urgency fee in a message to the Promotor.  It was
definitely submitted stating that it was an Urgent Proposal.

Threat will get another vote FOR through having the Speaker's vote.
They will also get to vote twice as a Group, though this will also be
true of Morendil's group and the OOEE assuming the former gets the
required membership.  Of course, Harlequin's gone on hold, and we do
only have five days.

Don't take this personally, but I think using the extra votes
entrusted to you as an Officer to give yourself a Win and unlimited
power is greedy, at the very least, if not downright slimy.

Nonsense.  This is in the tradition of the Grand Old Scams of yesteryear.
The scammers exploiting a loophole:

     1.) award themselves a win;
     2.) close the loophole cleanly.

It does _not_ give us unlimited power, or even _any_ extra power in the
long term.  It does not even give us any VTs.

Unless you mean that scams are dishonourable per se, it's hard to think of
a lesser reward that scammers ought to be satisfied with.  "Greedy" is
hardly the word.

             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You seem to be forgetting the Champion's reward. 8)

However, I agree with elJefe that this is a perfectly honorable scam in the
grand Agora tradition and doesn't deserve the characterization of "greedy".

It takes two things, working together, for a Proposal to be Urgent.
One is the declaration, which must be made at the time it was
proposed.  The other is the payment of the fee, which must be made
prior to _distribution_.  I assume elJefe is referring to the latter.

Not in the least.  It's called "loophole surfing" and is wholly in
keeping with the grandest traditions of Nomic.

That's fine; I would do the same in your position.  What I was trying
to point out is that I have a right to expect those representing me in
the Office not to abouse their power; if I think you're doing so it's
my right to try to remove you from Office.  As I said, "don't take
this personally", as I was referring to all Threat Officers whom I
perceive as not representing me.  (And before anyone says it, I know I
didn't vote for these people).

What Sherlock seems to be implying is that Officers should give up their
right to Win the Game, as winning would be looking out after their
interests over yours, and that this constitutes an "abuse" of power and is
"greedy", or "slimy".  I hope this is not an idea shared by many in the
Game.

Does he at least retract the suggestion that the proposal somehow seeks to
award us absolute power?

I'm assuming you hadn't received my apology when you wrote this.  But
I do think you misrepresented what I said.  Of course I don't object
to your right to Win--that is, after all, the "goal" of Nomic--but I
don't see where I'm supposed to sit by passively, either.  Do you see
my point that the Voters who install an Officer into Office have the
right to represent them, and if said Officers don't represent them, to
try to remove them?  

Again, I'm not trying to start a flame war here, just to justify my
call for Impeachment.  If you want apologies, I've already given two.

Don't be too fast.  There's a serious flaw in 3710, which we
may or may not be able to take advantage of.  I'll have to
look more carefully into the Rules, but if it can be done,
I'll work up a counterscam, and if it seems feasible I'd
recommend that we let 3710 pass.

Of course, it's probably best to go ahead and vote against
anyway, especially with the shortened voting period.  The
votes can be cancelled later if we decide it's better
to let it pass.

Oh, I almost forgot--I urge calm.

Um, who said that Officers were representing you?  You represent
yourself in Agora.  Officers in Agora are administrative, and there is
no reason to expect Officers to act in a representative capacity as
they might in a representative demoracy.

     Why what?  Why I voted against it?  I can't say exactly, but I

my presence might cause.

Except, of course, on those Referenda to Impeach your good self,
on which, according to R1486, you may not vote.

I don't think we've ever seen a Referendum to Impeach before.
What an interesting development.

I probably agree that 10 VTs is too much for winning, but I think some
VT reward is appropriate. Maybe I'll propose to halve it to 5 VTs.

But in your post you also made a wholly false allegation, which you
have not retracted, that we are using the loophole to give ourselves
unlimited power. We are most emphatically *not* doing this. We *could*
have done it: the loophole in the instrument Rules is big enough to
drive an International Harvester truck through. We could have used it
to create a Power 4 Rule stating that no Proposal can take effect without
the consent of the Threat, that all CFJs must be Judged by members of
the Threat, and so on. But of course such measures would have been
totally destructive of the game, and so we eschewed them. We even 
eschewed lesser measures which would not have been destructive of the
game, but which might have granted us a little extra permanent power.

I don't expect or wish you to sit passively by. By all means, do
everything in your power to defeat the scam. But you should realize
that Impeaching us will have no effect on the scam whatsoever.
(Actually, Impeaching us may have no effect, period, since the effects
of Impeachment seem mysteriously to have disappeared from the Ruleset,
but that's a separate issue.) Even if Impeaching us had the effect
of removing us from Office, the only purpose this could serve would
be to punish us for having conspired to win the game, something to
which you say you do not object.

You seem to be thinking of Officers as elected representatives to
a Parliament or Congress. That's confused. This is a directly
participatory democracy: we don't have 'representatives'. Everyone
gets to vote; you don't have to elect somebody to vote for you.
It's a mistake to think that Officers have a representative function:
what could that be? You represent yourself. Officers perform the
various duties which keep the game going. They should be judged on
how well they perform those duties.

It's an interesting phenomenon that every time we reduce VT supply,
VT expenditure drops further towards its theoretical minimum, which
it surely must be close to reaching on the above results, with only
5 votes cast as against 37 declarations of Presence.

As a suggestion for encouraging VT expenditure, how would people react
to the idea of making it a condition of passage for a Proposal that it
receive at least 3 votes FOR?

Actually, I did retract that, when I apologized for misinterpreting
the intent of the Instrument amendment.  Again, I am sorry.

I hope Michael will now concede that there was a point to the Revolt
of Feb 13 beyond "keeping a particular clique of Players in Office
while installing a new Speaker." Control of the Speakership was
absolutely crucial to the Officer's veto scam currently being attempted,
because of the Speaker's Right to Call Elections, and this was in fact
the motivation for the Revolt. I do apologize to Michael that we were
unable either to include him in the scam or to warn him of the extra
work involved, but I think subsequent events have shown that this
course was completely justified. At any rate, while Michael's two
Kudo transfers away from me were understandable at the time, I hope
it's clear that they were based on false assumptions which mistakenly
impugned my character and my motivations.

Again, I think you may have missed a message of mine.  I stated in one
that my main purpose for calling for Impeachment was so that we might
be able to avoid penalizing recently elected non-Threat officers by
removing the necessity for a Rebellion.  The issue of representation,
is also there, as I expand on below.

I partially agree.  But Officers also get some privileges, according
to their position.  In this case, the power in question is the right
to cast extra votes on Proposals related to the positions.  If I feel
that that right is being abused, it is then my duty to try to remove
said Officer from service.  Does that seem so insane?

Of course, we've got something like 25 votes already cast for and

combined. :)

Given the nature of the game, in which exploitation of loopholes is
a respected part of game play, a more realistic conclusion to draw
would be that as long as the right exists, it will be abused no 
matter who holds which Offices. That is why P3710 actually closes
the loophole by removing the right of Officers to vote FOR Proposals
which concern their duties. It was a mistake ever to have introduced
such a right into the game in the first place. So, if your real
concern is to see such abuses stop, you should support our actions,
and the scam Proposal. After all, if the scam Proposal fails, the
loophole will remain open. On the other hand if the scam Proposal
passes, as it probably will, the loophole will be closed and removing
us from Office will be pointless.

It's so reasonable, seen in that light. ;)

You forget that defeating a good Scam is as much fun as perpetrating
one, even if not as brilliant; and it would be no fun at all, esp.
for a Proposal Scam, to pass unopposed. "A vaincre sans peril, on
triomphe sans gloire." (And 1 Indulgence to the first Player to

Actually, I think it's interesting so see how the META-Game perception
of the role of Officers might change, now that they are receiving more
clout.  I think it might be a natural response to see a political
backlash against an Officer the "public" sees as "abusing" eir power,
since the standards of abuse are effectively a META concept (like the
idea behind Kudos)  I don't think that Officers should necessarily be
judged only on performance, after all, in RL politics those elected are
judged on whatever criteria the electorate judge to be appropriate--
while a candidate might say an issue is irrelevant to the job, it is the
electorate that decides relevancy, and a shrewd candidate will address
the electorate's concerns, however "irrelevant"...

Interesting remarks, Swann. It's certainly true that in RL politics,
elected officials are judged on criteria other than their performance. 
Whether this is as it should be is debatable. I think that Officers
*should* be judged on their performance. Nevertheless it is also
true, as you say, that a shrewd official will address whatever
concerns those who elect em may have.

That said, I still think the best reply to someone who, in Agora,
says "I elected you to represent me", is to say "No, you didn't.
You elected me to perform Official duties. In Agora, you represent
yourself."

It's true, of course, that the Rules give Officers power. In the case
of R1766 they give Officers way too much power. And I completely
agree that it's fair to judge an Officer by how e uses the power e is
given - that's judging em by eir performance. But if you think of
what we could have done with that power, but refrained from doing, I
think you'd have to conclude that in acting as we did we used our
power pretty responsibly. Anyone who claims that we should have done
even less than what we did is basically saying that they want a game
without scams. Does anyone really want that?

Oh, I completely agree with you. In some circumstances, defeating
the scam might be even more brilliant than perpetrating it. If
you manage to defeat the scam, I'll be the first to congratulate
you on your fine play. Give it your best shot.

But of course, Impeaching us, or otherwise kicking us out of Office,
will do nothing toward defeating the scam. All the reasons which
have so far been offerred for doing so run along the lines of:
"Oh, look at this terribly irresponsible abuse of Official power." I
just don't understand that reaction. It amounts to saying: "Hey,
these guys have executed a scam. They deserve to be kicked out of
Office for it."

I'll hazard a guess: Napoleon Bonaparte.

Please. I don't have a problem with the scam in itself, but pretending that
the Revolt and subsequent elections were about something other than getting
the Threat into power and riches is silly. I doubt any of you expect to
step down from your offices when the Scam is over.

That's not what Steve was disputing. Steve was arguing that it was not
"just" for the sake of grabbing offices. In fact, I don't think we 
actually realised beforehand how many Offices we could obtain this way.
The rebellion was solely to secure the Speakerhood, and to force other
players temporarily out of office, while we executed the scam, so as to
reduce the possibility of other players using the same loophole.

When it eventuated that we were not going to be able to rely on the 
rebellion to do this, we had to grab as many offices as possible, for the
same reason.

I cannot speaker for the rest of the Threat, but personally I will be 
voting quite differently in the next set of Elections. In the long term
I would prefer the Offices to be spread around a little more. I've had
my fun.

But you're right that I won't be stepping down as Promotor. I like the
Office and want to keep it. But that is beside the point. I doubt any of
the other non-Threat Offices will voluntarily give up their Offices 
either, so why should we be blamed if we try to keep ours?

We may not have any choice.  I should also note that some of us have
already lost Offices as a result of the past Elections.  The Threat by
no means has a stranglehold on Officerdom.

Why should I pretend anything? Do you want documentary evidence? The
subsequent Elections were not originally intended as part of the
scam. If the Revolt had triggerred an immediate Speaker Transition as
we had expected it to do (on the basis of how past Revolts had been
handled), then Speaker Morendil would not have had an opportunity to
use his Right to Call Elections to tip General Chaos and myself out
of the Offices of Archivist, Justiciar, Assessor and Chancellor. The
entire point of the attempt to exploit the Revolt/Delegation bug was
to engineer a situation in which a Threat member was the Speaker, and
three out of four Threat members were holding Offices in the normal
fashion. Because of our misapprehension concerning the operation of
the Speaker Transition rules after a Revolt, our first attempt to
engineer that state of affairs was a failure (and in any case,
elJefe's Delegation to Blob misfired when Blob unluckily ran into
mail trouble at a crucial moment). It took us a further 19 days of
sustained effort to make our second attempt succeed so that we
could at least attempt to execute the scam. That's why we tried
so hard to win the Elections.

It's a moot point. We're 8 days from another Revolt.
