Since we're handing out stuff, how about 1 free Indulgence too?
Second, of all, you need to be careful. As written, I believe
the Rule would give every current Player that ever had a Grace
Period 5 VTs and 1 P-note.

A good point, as well as being an Active Player.  Something to keep
in mind when writing a definition.  I would like to see something
like this defined, though, as it would probably have application
beyond just this particular instance.

There are already several instances already in the Rules where a
more general concept is being used.  See Rule 1793; Rule 1794; Rule
1795; Rule 1509; Rule 1502.  The language used varies somewhat, and is 
occasionally a bit too fuzzy for my like.

Why an indulgence? Isn't that just encouraging new players to receive
blots? It could be a dangerous precedent.

I've never known the reception of an indulgence to correlate with a
crime wave. I think it's a good idea because 1) New Players are more
likely to stray into mishap than more experienced ones, and 2)
Indulgences are extremely hard to come by these days.

There are about 2 per player at the moment. The VTs and the P-Notes
awards make sense, since they are used often and can be easily replaced,
but indulgences aren't exactly plentiful.

What's the point of regulating the format of the Registrar's report?

Protoproposal: Color-Blind

Amend rule 1502 to read as follows:

The Registrar's Report shall at least contain the following:

1. A list of all Registered Players, with their Nomic nickname,
preferred email address, current On/Off Hold status, and the date the
Player last Registered or went On or Off Hold.

2. A list of all Offices and other official positions within Agora (such
as Speaker), with the Nomic nickname of the holder of each position, and
(in the case of Offices) when the last Election for that Office was and
whether the Office is held temporarily.


Amend rule 1676 to read as follows:

Whenever a person registers as a Player in Agora, and that person has
not been registered as a Player in Agora at any time within the 12
months prior to this registration, e is subject to a Grace Period that
begins at the time of eir registration and ends two months afterwards.

A Player is only subject to the Grace Period resulting from eir own
registration.

The Registrar shall maintain a list of all Grace Periods that are in
progress.  For each such Grace Period this list shall include the Player
subject to the Grace Period, the time at which it started, and the time
at which it will end.  This list is part of the Registrar's Report.


Amend rule 649 to read as follows:

There is a class of entities known as Patent Titles.  Patent Titles can
be possessed only by persons.

The Registrar shall maintain a list of all Patent Titles that have been
awarded, and to whom they have been awarded, with the exception of any
such events of which the Rules state that they have no Historical
Significance.  This list is part of the Registrar's Report.


Amend rule 1465 to read as follows:

At the start of the first Nomic Week after the legal and correct
announcement that a Player has won a Game, that Player shall receive a
Champion's Reward.  The Champion's Reward shall last for four Nomic
weeks from that time, and is then withdrawn from
that Player.  As soon as possible after the legal and correct
announcement that a Player has won a Game, the Registrar shall pay out
four Voting Tokens to that Player.

Any Player who has been awarded a Champion's Reward that has not yet
been withdrawn, has the right to cast three votes on any Proposal.

The Registrar shall maintain a list of all Champion's Rewards which have
been granted and have not yet been withdrawn, including to whom they
have been granted, and their times of commencement and conclusion.  This
list is part of the Registrar's Report.

Well, I kind of regarded it as a harmless but cute bit of Agoran culture.
It's not hurting anyone is it? Why remove it?
