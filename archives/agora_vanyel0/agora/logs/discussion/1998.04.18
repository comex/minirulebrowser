I have previously stated that I am a bit of a stickler for the letter of
the law. The Proposal posted for voting was not the same as the Proposal
originally submitted. Therefore, I feel bound to uphold the judgement.

It's good to have something to do :o)

Most peculiar.

By Rule 1775, only Players can have a Score, and all Players do.
By Rule 1782, the Score of a Player cannot change except by the proper
procedure.

The former has precedence.

As long as any player can make the proposal Interested, why not just 
make Disinterested proposals just pass automatically, instead of this 
waving the minimum thing?

I recall that Ackanomic's Spelling Bee works/worked on such a Without
Objection principle.

I still think the idea of allowing absolutely anything to be done Without
Objection is nifty.  Given appropriate safeguards against burying
declarations in large messages, of course.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

Because it might be a Good Thing to have Disinterested proposals still play a
role in the competition for votes among proposals in a batch.

The concept of making Rule changes Without Objection is an interesting one
(which is what the automatic pass would amount to), but I see it as an
alternative to Disinterest.  You might want to make a separate proposal and see
which one Players prefer.
