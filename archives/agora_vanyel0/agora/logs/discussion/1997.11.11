No Double Penalties for Officers

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1007 be amended by deleting the
paragraph which begins "If the Rules pertaining...".

[It's truly unfair to Officers to both take away their Salaries _and_
whap them with an Infraction for the same thing.  Especially for the
Assessor, whose primary duty, tabulating Votes, does not yield a
document which must be published once each week.]

Protoproposal Chaos11 [rev. 1]

Fix Indulgence Distribution

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1712 be amended to read:

      At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Herald shall randomly
      distribute a number of Indulgences equal to the number of Blots
      executed in the past Week, less the number of Blots vacated in
      the past Week, among all Players: for each such Indulgence, the
      Herald shall randomly select one Player and issue a Payment
      Order from the Bank to that Player for one Indulgence.  If this
      number is negative, no distribution occurs.

[This was "adopted" during the VT-Free Era.]

I don't think it's unfair. And the Assessor only loses eir Salary if
e fails to produce a VT report.

I think under R1527, I was still Registrar when these Elections commenced,
and so I remain responsible for conducting these Elections. Damn, I should
have put that announcement after my announcement of Michael's being
Elected Registrar. Then these Elections would be his babies.

Yes.  The new R108 says nothing about retroactive effects in general;
it only prohibits effects retroactive to a time earlier than the Rule
gained its current form.  While there is some merit in such a limitation,
it is misleading to refer to it as a prohibition of retroactivity.

FWIW, the way I read the relevant Rules, consent being given is a
condition for success of the resignation, not a part of the process.

Exactly.  When producing a VT report is only one aspect of the

It is the old version of the Virus sentence. When we were infecting it
for a while, we found that we wanted the Virus to be more violent, and
changed it to the current situation.

By the way, both of these points are already tackled in Proposal 3593.

It doesn't matter what Steve does in this respect, now you've made
your CFJ (451). One _might_ argue that "issue" in 451 refers to the
time the CotC publishes eir assignment of a judge, but I'd prefer to
read it as referring to the time the CFJ was made/sent to the CotC.

Ah, but if Steve consents, then at the time of the CFJ, he was the
Justiciar because at that time, it was the case that he was going to
consent, and so the "knowledge of the future" clause can fire.

Justiciar because at that time, it was the case that he was going to
consent, and so the "knowledge of the future" clause can fire.
<<

This point only occured to me after I sent my mail. However, I am not
perfectly sure which aspects of the situation "at the time the CFJ was
issued" are 'frozen' by 451 as the basis for a judicial decision: one
might argue that if the availability or lack of information plays a
role for the CFJ (as in the present case) then the judgement should
only depend on the information available at the time when the CFJ was
made. That isn't the wording of 451, though.

If I were to judge this I would be tempted to take the logical paradox
involved so seriously that the CFJ must be dismissed under 1565 ii)
(Its Statement can not logically admit to either being TRUE or FALSE.)
However, this is only true as long as Steve doesn't post eir decision,
so such a dismissal would have to come before Steve's announcement.

Yes, I know.  Strictly speaking this is probably what should happen,
and we'd be stuck.  However, as I hinted at in my original CFJ, I'd be
happier to see the Judge attempt to create a precedent in rule
interpretation (one way or another).  If they don't, I'll probably
just give up on it, but I'd quite like to see Judges (CFJs) used in
this way.

That last should be conditional on the effectiveness of Rule

Rule 1741/0 (Power=1)
A Public Voting Experiment

      Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
      any votes by Voting Entities on Proposals, Elections or
      Referenda, may only be achieved by sending a message to the
      Public Forum.

      This Rule shall repeal itself 60 days after it is created.

I'd be interested in hearing the Justiciar candidates' views
on the relative importance of the four "preferred standards"
for judgement in R217.  I realize that for the most part
you can't make blanket statements such as "game custom
is always more important than common sense," but I would
be interested in hearing general thoughts on these.

Past Judgements carry a lot of weight for me, and I will defer to them
whenever it seems reasonable.  As for the others, Game Custom and
commonsense are of roughly equal weight; however, as I have a better
idea of what commonsense is than what Game Custom is, I expect I would
be somewhat more inspired by the former.  (I am dubious of Game Custom
that is inconsistent with commonsense, in any case.)  The best
interests of the game are often too nebulous to grasp to make any
great use of them in judging, and I doubt I would give this criterion
much weight except perhaps to break a closely balanced impasse between
the others.

I feel I should point out that both of my Proposals were sent to the
Promotor before you declared your policy, and thus rightfully do not
fall under its purview.

I think it's too late to withdraw officially. You can, of course,
withdraw unofficially.

Sorry, I didn't see this post before consenting. Nevertheless, I think
the purpose of the CFJ will still be served, since R451 will require
the Judge to consider its truth at the time it was made.
