I have been looking into that more carefully. What I find is this 
language in R206 :

      Each Voting Entity has two votes on a Proposal, unless another
      Rule says otherwise. However, no such Entity shall have more
      than five votes on any Proposal, regardless of what any other
      Rule may say to the contrary.

It seems to me that this is strictly equivalent to :

   Each Voting Entity may cast a maximum of two votes on a Proposal,
   unless another Rule states otherwise.
   Each Voting Entity may cast a maximum of five votes on a Proposal,
   even if another Rule states otherwise.

I am translating both "has N Votes" and "has no more than N Votes" 
into "may cast a maximum of N Votes" because that's what both mean;
obviously the first sentence in the paragraph from 206 does not state 
that a Player shall always cast two Votes on a Proposal, but rather 
that e may choose to cast up to two Votes.

If this is correct, then we have been interpreting Rule 206 such 
that, absent other Rules altering its dictates, a Player may cast up 
to two Votes, because that is the lesser of two and five, i.e., the 
limit that results from taking into account both limits specified by 
206.

We have also had straightforward cases of Rules specifying a 
different limit, such as 1465. We have interpreted this to give a 
Champion up to three Votes; in other words, the relevant set of 
restrictions was

   A Champion may cast a maximum of three votes on a Proposal [1465].

   Each Voting Entity may cast a maximum of five votes on a Proposal,
   even if another Rule states otherwise. [206]

The limit being the lower of the two, i.e. three.

>From Game Custom, it would appear that Rule 1660 has been similarly
interpreted, but it contains an extra twist in the form of that
redundant clause :

   A Speaker may cast a maximum of three votes on a Proposal [1660].

   Each Voting Entity may cast a maximum of <five> Votes on a 
   Proposal. [1660]

   Each Voting Entity may cast a maximum of five votes on a Proposal,
   even if another Rule states otherwise. [206]

Where we get <five> in 1465 from interpreting "the maximum allowable
Votes that can be cast by a Voting Entity". The limit is the maximum 
of three, five and five.

The contentious Rule is 1766, where we have :

   The relevant Officers may cast <M+2> votes on a Proposal affecting
   the Office. [1766]

   These Officers may cast a maximum of <N> Votes on a Proposal. [1766]

   Each Voting Entity may cast a maximum of five votes on a Proposal,
   even if another Rule states otherwise. [206]

Where the limit is the lesser of <M+2>, <N>, and five, with <N>
being "the maximum number of Votes that are permitted to be cast by
that Player", and <M> being "what e is otherwise entitled to cast".

The term "otherwise" should be IMHO be interpreted to mean "absent
this Rule", which would give for <M> values of 2 for an ordinary
Player and 3 for one who is either the Speaker, a Champion, or both.
I am of course open to other interpretations should someone offer
any.

Now, it seems to me that both Steve and Antimatter have offered
alternative interpretations of how to find out <N>; Antimatter
essentially proposes that we read it as  "the maximum number that
are otherwise permitted to be cast by that Player", which makes it in 
effect equal to <M>, and Steve proposes that we read it as "the 
maximum number of Votes that are generally permitted to be cast by 
Voting Entities", which makes it five.

Would anyone say my own reasoning so far is fallacious ? I'll take
it from there if it looks sane.

Also, so far I've only had feedback from Antimatter and Steve on
that issue; given that the outcome of this Judgement might have
largish consequences on our perception of the Game State, I would
very much appreciate other opinions and flavors of reasoning. I'm 
actually surprised that so few Players have commented given the 
eventual consequences.

As it is, I am slightly tempted to Judge by flipping a coin and kick
it up to the higher Court by calling for its Appeal myself, both
because I stated that I did not want to formulate an opinion on this
until and unless I was presented with it as Justiciar (and of course,
I had to be selected as Judge !) and because I suspect that it will
probably be Appealed anyway. Doing that would at least save time,
because otherwise I'm going to ponder this, as the Judge, for as long 
as I'm allowed to.

It seems to me that your reasoning is pretty good up to this point,
and that if, as seems possible, you do have to set some sort of
precedent, then the Appelate Court is going to have a hard time
reversing your judgement.  Recall the custom that it's there only to
correct errors, not to question precedent-setting judgements.

If it really does come down to a coin-toss, write the case for it as
carefully as possible so that there can be no doubt that what you are
doing is sound, and then toss the coin (perhaps only figuratively :-)

Michael.

Would you say that this Rule should have Power=2 or Power=3?

I have two worries about this course, which is not to say that I'm
not prepared to go along with it. My first worry may be minor, but
it's this: your translation of the five vote limit in R206 cannot be
correct, for it has the consequence that all Voting Entities have
the right to cast 5 votes on every Proposal, something which R206
does not itself imply. Or at any rate, it would have the consequence
that, say, all Champions have the right to cast 5 votes on Proposals,
since your versions say that they can, even if another Rule, eg R1465,
say otherwise, namely that they can only cast 3. But that can be fixed
by changing the second 'otherwise' to read 'that e can cast more than 5'.

My second worry is more substantial, and is one that I've already tried
to articulate to Antimatter. I'm uncomfortable that the word 'maximum'
should be used in connection with the two vote limit, since we have
so many Rules which increase this so-called 'maximum' under various
circumstances. But perhaps this comes down only to this: that as you
employ the word 'maximum' it is relativized to the highly specific 
circumstances of the individual Player, so that one can say that
Crito can currently cast a maximum of two votes on a some particular
Proposal (because, of course, we can't speak now of Proposals generally,
since on a Proposal to amend the duties of the Herald, Crito would be
able to cast up to 4 votes), whereas I want to reserve the word 'maximum'
to refer to the very general circumstance that no Player can cast more
than 5 votes, period. 

The choice of which usage is to be preferred seems to me partly to
come down to this: on your usage, R1766 is drastically self-
contradictory, since it grants extra votes with one provision and
immediately takes them back in the very next provision. On my usage,
however, R1766 is clear and unequivocal, not self-contradictory and
works in a straightforward way. It seems to me commonsense to prefer
such an interpretation, since it is so clearly available, particularly
when the other interpretation is so strained. I would almost go so
far as to say that the context of R1766 virtually forces the
interpretation that 'maximum' in that Rule at the very least, refers
to the five vote limit, and not to the other-things-being-equal two
vote limit. How can it make sense to read 'maximum' there as referring
to the other-thing-being-equal two vote limit, when the whole point
of R1766 is to specify one of the circumstances in which other things are
*not* equal?

In a nutshell, then , here's my claim: Antimatter's and my conflicting
claims about how to interpret the word 'maximum' in R1766 (and perhaps
in other Rules), are not equally plausible. Flipping a coin would not
be a good way to break the 'tie' between them. The context of R1766
virtually forces my interpretation of R1766 at the expense of 
Antimatter's.

Back up a second--the way I was interpreting the situation is that the
Calls for Impeachment passed, but they did not succeed, as one of the
requirements for Impeachment listed by R1486 is that the Player
specified by the Call for the Impeachment must hold that Office for it
to take effect.

To appease you, however, I'll issue a second, clearer report.

Zefram, please do tell me, was there any way at all in which that
remark was a useful contribution to the current debates? I take it
you're not seriously suggesting that the instrument loophole is
the result of a deliberate ploy by Scott. What, then? That it was
dishonourable of Scott to participate in any way in a scam involving
a Rule or Rules he authored? Well, what I said about Swann goes
equally for Scott, too: Scott may have written the instrument Rules
(although he had input from other Players), but we all adopted them.
In the case of P3445 (More Power to the People), the vote to adopt
was an overwhelming 21-1, with yours the only vote against. That was
nearly a year ago, now: March 26 marks the first anniversary of the
passage of P3445. Why are you still bitter about it? In any case,
I would have thought that a loophole that's been in the Rules for
a whole year is fair game for whomever comes upon it, even if that
person happens to be the author of the Rule containing the loophole.
Not that that's even true in this case: the loophole was discovered by
Jeff, with Scott for the most part in the role of supportive but fairly
passive observer.

I quite agree with all these points; but: just as we usually don't
accept assumptions about the intentions of a rule's author (although
there may be quite clear evidence what this intention was) I think we
also should not assume too easily that a rule's author doesn't want
the rule to be self-contradictory - or assume that just because e
doesn't _want_ it to be selfcontradictory, it isn't.

We've had other cases before where other players came up with
interpretations of a rule that had not occurred to its author, or a
rule's author even had to admit that the rule simply was broken and
didn't do what e had intended it to do.

Tee hee! But I think you got Blob and I reversed. I'm Ernie, and
e's Miss Piggy. Or, at least, Miss Blobby. Although, given his
irascible nature, and deadly (verbal) karate chop, perhaps the
good General is really Miss Piggy. Which might well make me Kermit.
So maybe it's me and the General you have reversed. :) :)

Reread my post: I said nothing about the author's intention, nor does
my argument rely on it. Indeed, I would be making the same argument if
the author of the Proposal were busily insisting in the Public Forum
that his intention was that the Rule be self-contradictory. What I
argued was basically that the Rule makes no sense on its own terms
interpreted one way, and that it makes very good sense interpreted the
other way, and that this is sufficient reason to prefer the sensible
interpretation. The author's intention is, as you say, neither here
nor there.

Dear Morendil,

thanks for this detailed exposition of the situation. I found it quite
helpful.

One point of detail:

>>
The contentious Rule is 1766, where we have :

   The relevant Officers may cast <M+2> votes on a Proposal affecting
   the Office. [1766]

   These Officers may cast a maximum of <N> Votes on a Proposal. [1766]

   Each Voting Entity may cast a maximum of five votes on a Proposal,
   even if another Rule states otherwise. [206]

Where the limit is the lesser of <M+2>, <N>, and five, with <N>
being "the maximum number of Votes that are permitted to be cast by
that Player", and <M> being "what e is otherwise entitled to cast".
<<

You could also argue that the phrase that contains <N> is a truism:
just insert your definition of <N> into the sentence that contains
<N>, and you get 

"These Officers may cast a maximum of (the maximum number of Votes
that are permitted to be cast by that Player) Votes on a Proposal"

I.e. they can cast just as many votes as they can cast.

Let me add another, more political remark (made on the metagaming
level, though ;). Of course, this CFJ is not an abstract one, but one
which can influence the success or failure of the recent scam. So your
decision is not only a purely formal one, but also a highly political
one. As I see it, such a political role of judges is something that is
not excluded in Nomic, and while I would strongly protest against such
"political" judgements in real life, I don't think there is anything
dishonorable about including political aspects into a decision as an
Agora judge.

In fact, I find it quite amusing to see you all debating the details
of the arguments around this CFJ, all the time beating around the bush
and never mentioning what the CFJ is really about...

Of course, this political aspect only enters because a non-Threat has
been chosen as judge for this CFJ. A Threat judge, or a Threat
dominated Appeals court, would probably find it easy to simply follow
Steve's reasoning and judge the CFJ accordingly.

Anyway, just my 2 cents...

Kolja A.

Uhh, have you seen Sesame Street?  That's not Miss Piggy, it's Oscar!
Also, I don't think that's Kermit, I think it's one of the undefined
Red or Blue Creatures.  Also, Blob isn't Ernie, he's Bert!

Heh.  It's too early in the morning for this. :)

Hm, it's a bit of grey area exactly what 'tallying' means, but I
would have thought that at the very least it would include the
total numbers of votes for and against the Referenda, if not a
list of hiow individual players voted.

'Dishonourable' I won't enter into. But 'not good for the long term
health of the game' is not a difficult case to make. Among the direct
causes of the death of Nomic World was a collapse in trust in the
judicial system to deliver Judgements based on principle and not the
political needs of the moment. If Players conclude that the judicial
system will deliver only Judgements in the interests of the Judges,
then the primary function of the Judicial system of resolving disputes
is undermined.

Now, were those remarks made on the metagaming level, or the roleplaying
level? And what about *these* remarks? *This very remark*? :)

*You* say it's on the metagaming level. But how do I know that? :)

Touch'e - good point! Of course, it's hard to separate the two, and
clearly you cannot be sure. In fact, it is a mixture, I guess. But my
main reason for bringing this point up really was quite simply that
noone else had mentioned it, and I found this "beating around the
bush" quite amusing. I also think that Morendil is quite aware of this
aspect, so I don't really need to tell him about it.

In addition, I'm a bit unsure how I should play in the future - the
meta level can be a bit drier and more boring occasionally, but it
includes less risk of annoying or hurting people...

>>
'Dishonourable' I won't enter into. But 'not good for the long term
health of the game' is not a difficult case to make. Among the direct
causes of the death of Nomic World was a collapse in trust in the
judicial system to deliver Judgements based on principle and not the
political needs of the moment.
<<

Good point. But there aren't just the two extremes, of a Nomic
World situation, and an "ideal" nomic where all judgements are
completely unpolitical, right?

In fact, one of the general observations I'm coming back to again and
again recently when I think about real life society and politics is
that in real systems extremes like these will never work (at least not
for long): if things are too bad (the judges too short term
politically oriented) the system will collapse, if they are close to
ideal, there is no reason why one shouldn't tweak the system and
deviate from the ideal situation occasionally; therefore people will
always do it (and hope they don't push the system so far from its
ideal state that it becomes unstable and crashes). The state of a
society then has a lot to do with how far people allow the system to
go away from the ideal state, and whether it remains on the stable
side or is drawn into collapse (the latter also depends on mentality
and the readiness of people to duffer from nonideal decisions and
injustice).

I don't see the point. If it is honourable, and in fact considered a
major success and something that characterizes a good nomic player, to
pull off great scams, why shouldn't it be an even greater display of
nomicking skill to introduce loopholes and then use them?  (Yes, I'm
aware that Scott didn't do this in the present case). The
responsibility for rules lies with those who adopt them, not with
those who author them.

I'm getting more and more disoriented and confused about what kind of
"honour" we are talking about here.

Maybe, maybe not.  I'm undecided.  But the discussion of this issue
w.r.t. Swann makes it seem rather odd that no one commented that the
General was profiting from a loophole e introduced.

Quite so.  All credit to Scott for getting PttP adopted with a loophole
that was even pointed out at the time.

Heh, I was just having fun with the "broken" Referenda rules -- for
example, has anyone noticed that a Referenda only takes effect when 
the Results are announced, but that no mechanism requires them to be
announced?  Likewise, I was playing around with the fact that I just
had to announce the "results" of the Impeachment Referenda -- which I
with pictures mostly.  However, for convenience sake, I will post a
more "serious" report later today, when I have time to write one up.

I made a similar proto recently.  But go ahead and submit this one if you want

A discovery (or re-discovery) made by Jeff and myself independently;
I thought some people might like to see what I almost proposed--
the reason the Threat co-opted me.  Because the mechanism of passage
was quite different in this scam (I didnt use the Officers Veto)
parts of this unproposal have been censored so I can adapt those parts
for a future endeavor.

(I, in fact, may propose this if the late CFJ finds against the
 Officers Veto Scam. ;)

Never-Made UnProposal: [censored]

Formatting Note:  The Rules created by this proposal are delimited by
"===" to help distinguish them.  The non-proposed Rule creations are
delimited by "***."  Instruments created by Rules are between quotes.


Let the following Rule be created (text delimited by "===")
{Title: The Trumpet};

===

     There is a type of instrument known as a Trumpet.  The only
     Trumpets that may exist are those created by the Rules created by 
     the Proposal that created this Rule.  All Trumpets have a Power of 
     4.  Trumpets are bodies of text defined by the Rules.  Trumpets 
     have an initialization clause and a resolution clause.  Rule 
     Changes defined in the initialization Clause of a Trumpet 
     take effect immediately after the Rule Creating the Trumpet is 
     created.  Rule Changes defined in the resolution clause of a 
     Trumpet take effect at the time defined in the text of the Trumpet, 
     or immediately after the initialization clause takes effect if such 
     a time is unspecified.  A Rule defining a Trumpet shall be repealed 
     by this Rule as soon as all provisions in the Trumpet it defines
     have taken effect.

     This Rule shall repeal itself at 00:00:00 GMT on April 1st 1998.

===

{Comment: Guess what?  Read the Ruleset Week paid off with a major
          loophole.  There is nothing to prevent a Power=1 Rule from 
          defining an instrument of arbitrary Power.  Proposals are 
          fairly well delimited, and Rules can't directly change Rules
          of higher power, but through this back door a Rule can define
          an instrument to alter any other Rule at its whim.  Ain't 
          this neat?  [censored] }


===

[censored]

===


Let the following Rule be created (text delimited by "===")
{Title: [censored]}

===

     This Rule creates a Trumpet with the following quoted text;

     "Initialization Clause;
           The following rule is created with an Power=3
           (text delimited by "***")
           {Title: What I get out of this.};

                ***

                It is hereby resolved that, upon the adoption of this
                Rule, all win preventing conditions are removed from 
                Player Swann, and Player Swann wins the game immediately
                thereafter.

                This Rule shall repeal itself at 00:00:00 GMT on April 
                1st 1998.

                ***

      Resolution Clause (to take effect immediately before 00:00:00 GMT
      on April 1st 1998) ;
      
          Let the following rule be created with an Power=3
          (text delimited by "***")
          {Title: Limits on the Power of Instruments};

               ***

               No instrument can create another instrument with a Power 
               greater than its own Power.  This Rule takes precedence 
               over any Rule that specifies the Power of the created
               instrument.  Proposals are explicitly exempt from this
               provision.

               In the specific case of Proposals, a Proposal shall have
               a Power equal to its Adoption Index.  In no case shall a
               Proposal take effect unless its Voting Index exceeds its
               Adoption Index, (or equals it in the case both equal
               Unanimity) and the Rules otherwise permit it to take
               effect.  A Proposal cannot create an instrument with a
               Power that exceeds the Proposal's Power.

               If an instrument creates another instrument, and fails to
               specify a legal Power for the created instrument, the 
               Power of the new instrument is 1.


               ***"


===

{Comment: It's traditional to scam a win with Proposals like this, and I 
          tried to make that my only gain upon this proposal.  It's also 
          traditional to close the loopholes in such a scam, which I 
          think this does.}

Hmm, that's not quite the case. The translated provisions are a
manner of expressing the *effect* of these particular Rules; the
specification for <N> is how the Rules in general define some
quantity, and the two are different. It's a meta thing... Guess I 
need to rephrase things a bit so that one doesn't get the impression
you got.

That is quite understood. But, while I completely agree with the
above, I find myself having to approach this CFJ not only as a
Judge, where I would probably just return a decision of TRUE on any
old grounds and sit back to enjoy the ensuing chaos, but as a 
potential Justice - where I need to consider the Statement with the 
utmost care and respect of the Rules. Since it would be absurd to
be prepared to return two different Judgements on the same Statement,
I have to do the Justice's job, as it were, even as an ordinary 
Judge.

Well, I think the two other Justices, being Threat members, were 
Barred anyway, so that's not going to happen; which will make the 
Appeal, if there is one, all the more interesting, but also makes it 
all the more important to have a careful Judgement to work from.

Of Votes and Baby Bottles

I think Morendil provided an excellent description of the problem. 
Unfortunately I do not think the "preferred" interpretation of maximum is as
clear cut as Steve seems to think.  The maximum number of votes that a
particular Player is permitted to cast on a particular proposal is *not* five. 
It is a number that depends on the particular circumstances of that Player and
that Proposal at the time the votes are cast.

      If a particular Proposal amends the duties or description of a
      particular Office, and a Player holds that Office in normal
      fashion, and that Player is not the same Player who Proposed the
      Proposal, then that Player may cast two additional votes on that
      Proposal beyond what e is otherwise entitled to cast.  This
      shall not increase the maximum number of votes that are
      permitted to be cast by that Player.

The wording of the last sentence ("that Player") forces the interpretation that
this sentence applies to a particular Player (the Player described in the first
part of the Rule).  However, it is ambiguous as to whether or not the last
sentence applies to a particular proposal.  IMO, the first part of the Rule, in
its continuous reference to a particular Proposal, lends some weight to
Antimatter's interpretation, although by no means definitively.  I'm afraid
it's still something of a coin toss, but I see the coin weighted a bit
differently than Steve.

It is unfortunate that this must be decided in the current "political" climate,
as Kolja reminded us, because it makes it hard to express views that won't be
interpreted as being politically motivated.  I really have tried to look at
this in a way that is independent of how it affects the recent scam.  And I'm
inclined to believe that other's who have expressed views on this have done the
same.

Rule 217/3 (Power=1)
Judgements Must Accord with the Rules

      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however,
      if the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the
      Statement to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider game
      custom, commonsense, past Judgements, and the best interests of
      the game before applying other standards.

Greetings,
rjan.

It is quite clear that the latter is required by the Rules.

I have never deliberately written a loophole into a Proposal of my
own.  I have, however, deliberately voted for a Proposal, knowing that
the Proposal contains a loophole, with the plan of exploiting it after
its adoption.

I'm sorry about that.  If you'd like, I'll issue a corrected version.

I've done this (albeit I miswrote Crito's vote.)

I thought that only applied when money was involved (I could be wrong,
however, as I admit I don't know much about copyright law).  And,
unless you're a representative of CTW or Jim Henson himself, I'm not
going to be too concerned about this. :)

No problem.  Don't bother with a correction, I just wanted to set the record

No penalty is necessary.  You are obligated to obey the Rules.

Nevertheless, there is also Rule 1439.

That does not mean that you are not obliged by the Rules to announce them,
it merely means that there is no penalty for failing to do so. Actually,
there could be a penalty, since a CFJ might be made alleging that you
violated R1434 by failing to fulfil the obligations it imposed on you.
If Judged TRUE, you would incur a penalty of 1 Blot, and have to submit
a Formal Apology.

Why does there need to be an explicit penalty for not performing an
obligation for an obligation to exist?  Should I send you off to go
read H. L. A. Hart's thesis on the nature of law?  John Austin's a bit
discredited these days. :)

You are obligated to publish the results, regardless of the lack of an
explict penalty.  If nothing else, you can be found to have violated a
Rule and ordered to produce a Formal Apology.

It becomes criminal infringement if money is involved.  I do know

Still, if you have the power to make it so a group of Officers either
are Impeached or are not, 1 Blot is a small penalty compared to the
bribes you could solicit.  Just an idea.

Being a Roman and Byzantine historian, I know very little of
democratic law, and I haven't read either of the authors you name.
Nevertheless, I'll offer some uneducated opinions on the topic, as I
find it interesting.

Think of speeding, copying music, littering or any other number of 
"minor" offenses.  There's no way you'd perform any of the above
actions if you thought you'd be caught.  Yet they are against the law.
Few people seriously keep up to the standard of the "Crito" in this
respect; you get away with what you can.

Should it be any different here?  For one, it's a whole lot easier to
get caught, given the comparatively small number of actions. Secondly,
as almost all action occurs in the public eye, it is hard to get away 
with any offenses.  But does that mean that if given the opportunity
cheating is unethical?  It seems like real life--you accept there's a
chance you'll get caught, and you weigh that against possible benefits.

I don't know.

I'm not the type of person to cheat, but I think I could handle it
from other Players if an appropriate means of Punishment existed if
they were caught.

A Formal Apology vs. someone getting Impeached?  That doesn't seem like
a fair trade-off.

Again, not trying to be argumentative or mean-spirited; I'm just
thinking out loud. :)

The atmosphere has heated up, but only a little. This has been one of
the most civilized responses to a scam in my experience. After the
Mousetrap scam, comparisons were made between myself and Adolf Hitler!
It's interesting to think about why these two scams generated such
different levels of heat in response. (If you haven't read Swann's
history of the Mousetrap scam - although I bet you have - I recommend
that you do so. It's a document as fine in its way as your own, and
there are many points of contact between them.) Firstly, the nature
of the loophole that the Mousetrap scam attempted to exploit made it
politically a 'dirtier', more controversial kind of scam, since it
attempted to force Players into the Jurisdiction of a Organizational
Compact without their consent, something that was bound to cause a
lot of antagonism. By contrast, the Officer's Veto scam is a
relatively 'clean' scam. Secondly, the legality of the loophole was
much more seriously - indeed, successfully - questioned, in a way
that the legality of the Officer's Veto loophole or the instrument
loophole has not really been (although Antimatter's CFJ is now getting
a fair bit of attention). This explains why so-called 'side issues'
are getting more attention.

Interesting. These 'one or two steps back' signal to me that you are
entering metagaming mode, in which Players' motivations, intentions,
etc are freely discussed, as you describe in II.2 below. Your remarks
in sections IV and V are also pretty clearly in metagaming mode. Yet
one of the purposes of the article appears to be the defence of the
roleplaying approach. It seems to me significant that this defence
of the roleplaying approach comes in the metagaming style. This suggests
to me that the two approaches are not really in conflict with each
other, as you occasionally seem tempted to suggest, but are rather
complementary.

That is a very interesting question, and I'd like to make a
contribution of my own. As an example, consider Sherlock's calls for
Impeachment, and my reaction to it. In your article, you put
forward a kind of theory about these events in terms of the
metagaming vs roleplaying distinction you introduce. The theory goes
that Sherlock's actions were more properly interpreted as roleplaying
or in character actions, and that my indignant response to it arose
from having misinterpreted those actions as personal attacks on the
metagame or out of character level. But the truth may be more
complicated than that, and may result in the blurring of the
distinction between roleplaying and metagaming. For consider this
alternative theory: although perfectly well aware that Sherlock's
actions were not intended as personal attacks on the metagaming
level, in my judgement the most politically effective way to reply
to them was to respond to them as if they were. Now, putting it
that way makes it sound as if my responses to the situation were
entirely cynical and manipulative, and that is not true. I genuinely
was upset at the prospect of being Impeached. Nevertheless, I also
did think that allowing other Players to see that I was upset, instead
of hiding my upsetness beneath a mask of urbanity, was probably a
better course to take. All of which is to say: I can be roleplaying
even when I'm metagaming; it doesn't have to be one or the other.

I think this shows in my general play. On the one hand, you might
count me as one of the most active political roleplayers: I make
shady deals in smoky, if virtual, backrooms, I form alliances
with Players based on mutual interest and convenience rather than
on principle, and in general involve myself in all the kinds of
activities which you rightly characterize as typical of the
political roleplayer. I've also joined you in trying to get Rules
adopted which encourage this 'sharp' style of political play.
Hence my campaigns to abolish free voting, introduce VT scarcity,
and so on.

On the other hand, I'm also one of the most active metagamers. I love
the kind of analysis you engage in in your article, or that we see in
Swann's history of the Mousetrap scam, and I've written quite
theoretical essays about Nomic myself: on the concept of breaking the
Rules, on the relationship between Power and precedence, on the
concept of a 'Rule Change' in the Initial Set. I have a
theoretician's interest in voting systems and how they interact with
human psychology. I've studied game theory, and I'm particularly
interested in mathematical approaches to situations of negotiation.

It seems to me that in my own personal case, I've developed a
role for myself as metagamer, which I play with great enthusiasm.
I'm not denying the utility of your distinctions, but they do have
their limits.

Has anyone else here read David Foster Wallace's _Infinite Jest_?
I'm thinking in particular of the extraordinary passage concerning
the Enfield Tennis Academy game of Eschaton, which illustrates this
point.

At the time, my rationale for acting as I did was that I'd invested
considerable time and political capital in bringing about a situation
in which I might get to make those decisions, and so it seemed a waste
not to follow through and make decisions favouring my political allies,
even if it meant taking some heat for it.

But I've since had a change of heart, to the extent that I'd like to
make the following announcement. If two more of the 4 currently 
Rebellious Players (Harlequin, Sherlock, Morendil and Time Agent)
will agree to become Abiding, so pushing the prospect of another
Revolt further into the distance, then I will use my Speaker's
Right to Call Elections to free up some of the Offices held by
the Threat, namely, Scorekeepor, Commander-in-Chief and Archivist.
Bearing in mind that Crito will soon be Elected Accountor (General
Chaos is not really contesting the Election), this will reduce
the number of Offices held by the Threat from 10 to 6, basically
restoring the political balance.

I view this issue about 'that Player' vs 'a Player' as a bit of a
distraction. The real force of my argument lies in the following
observation: if we interpret the provision "This shall not increase
the maximum number of votes that are permitted to be cast by that
Player." as meaning that the Player referred to may not cast more
than two votes, then what the Rule says (simplifying a little) is:
The Player may cast four votes. No, wait a minute, e can't, e can
only cast two. That's absurd and self-contradictory. On the other
hand if we read that same provision as meaning that the extra 2 votes
granted by the previous provision shall not have the effect of granting
the Player more than 5 votes on a Proposal, then, although the provision
is strictly speaking redundant in light of R206 (and so what? Redundancy
is not such a bad thing), the Rule as a whole makes perfect sense. So
what we have here are competing interpretations, one of which is self-
contradictory and makes a nonsense of the Rule, and one of which is
sensible. In that situation, it's seems clear to me that the sensible
interpretation is always to be preferred.

I also know quite a bit about copyright, and I'm not sure I
agree with Scott.  (Although Scott is right in noting that
money doesn't have to be involved for it to be a violation
of copyright law.)  It seems to me that an artist's rendition
of a character is no more in violation of copyright than
me rephrahsing a copyrighted work in my own words--also
permitted by copyright.  In fact, I'm not sure characters
can be copyrighted at all.

Now, the rendition may be a *trademark* violation, but I don't
know so much about that.

Also, use of the ASCII art may be a copyright violation of
the person who created the ASCII art.

Do the above constitute a single provision, or two severable
provisions?  A single Amendment, or two?

>Proto-Proposal:  Plots (v3.5)

This new version looks pretty good. Could I ask you to add one more
provision, to repeal Rule 1788 (VT Unemployment Benefits)? If Plots
passes, the rationale for R1788 will have been removed.

Can you offer a numerical analysis of the likely effect of v3.5, 
without Adjacency bonuses, on inputs to the economy, particularly
of VTs?

Why so many Ergs? 50 seems like a lot. What is the motivation for this
figure?

Are you aware that the provision which cancels all obligations to
transfer Currency means that voting on the entire batch of Proposals
in which Plots is contained, as well as some of the voting on the
previous batch, will be free? Perhaps you regard this as compensation
for destroying most of everybody's VTs, but somehow it doesn't seem
right to me. Depending on timing, the provision might also have the
effect of cancelling a week's Salaries, which also doesn't seem right.
This provision is there, I know, to close the loophole in R1754.
Perhaps what you should do is this: change the provision in the
Proposal to cancel only those obligations which the Bank has to
transfer Currencies Players under the authority of R1754, and then
adjust the other provision so that everyone gets 7 VTs rather than 5,
the idea being that they'd use the extra 2 VTs to pay for their votes
on the previous batch(es). What do you think?

Aye, there's the rub.  I don't see it as a distraction but as the central issue
to the problem.  Either the distinction between "a Player" and "that Player" is
inconsequential, in which case everything else you said here holds true, or it
introduces a bad mistake into the Rule which has the unintended consequence of
depriving the rest of the Rule of its effect.  Like the difference between
"Adoption Index" and "Adoption Ratio".

I'm not sure. Game custom would probably have it as one Amendment,
inasmuch as we've generally held that Proposals which tinker with a
Rule in various ways only increment the Amendment Number by one.
Although against that there's the precedent of the Frankenstein
Generator, which, we decided, amended the Frankenstein Rule twice
each week. Then again, that was a Rule and this is a Proposal, and
perhaps that makes some difference, although I can't immediately
see why it would...it's all very confusing, really :)

Tsk, tsk, never assume that something that applies to literary works
applies to visual works.  The scope of copyright protection varies a
lot between work classes, and as it happens, most artistic renditions
of a work (i.e. a translation of a work into another visual medium) is
legally a derived work under the terms of the Copyright Act.
Characters for which there is a visual depiction can and are routinely
copyrighted as visual works.

Rephrasing of literary works is also tricky: translations are
considered derived works; rephrasing may or may not constitute
derivation depending on the degree of originality involved.
Rephrasing in the context of brief quotation is not infringing not
because of any originality, but because Section 107 specifically
excludes "fair use" copying from the scope of copyright protection.
(What exactly constitutes "fair use" is probably the most complex area
of copyright law.)

I think that misrepresents the logical structure of my argument. You
make it sound as if I'm arguing from the inconsequentiality of the
distinction to the interpretative conclusion I defend. If that were true,
I would then be in need of independent supportive argumentation for 
the premise that the distinction is inconsequential. But that's not 
how I'm proceeding at all. My premises are actually the ones described
above, that one possible interpretation makes nonsense of the Rule,
while the other interpretation makes sense of it. I conclude from this
that the sensible interpretation is to be preferred, and from *this*
it follows that the distinction is inconsequential. It's easy to see
why. If "the maximum number of votes that are permitted to be cast by
that Player" refers to the five vote limit, as the above argument suggests
it must, then it would make no difference if "that Player" were replaced
by "a Player". The effect of the Rule would be the same.

If you want to rebut my argument, you'll have to attack either its
validity, by arguing that a nonsensical interpretation of R1766 is
to be preferred to a sensible one, or the truth of its premises, by
arguing that the situation with respect to the available interpretations,
sensible and nonsensical, is not as I have described it.

H. Wizard-Delegate Scott,

I forgot to award you 2 Points for earning a +3 Style Change. You

I tend to agree; I have generally held that multiple
changes (small c) to a Rule, listed together in a Proposal,
are a single Rule Change, unless the language indicates
otherwise.  (For example, if P3710 said, "The Rule is amended
by replacing <number>...  The Rule is amended by replacing
<time> with...." I would probably consider that 2 Rule Changes.)

However, I'm also concerned about whether that sentence constitutes
two "severable provisions" as mentioned in R594.  Is it possible
for a single Rule Change to contain two severable provisions?
If so, is this such a case?

That's not quite right. The Caller of a CFJ may bar at most three
Players - and there are four Threats. Antimatter chose to bar Blob,
elJefe and General Chaos, an interesting decision given that he knew
at the time that I was Speaker and would therefore serve as Justice
on any Appeal of the CFJ. Assuming that this wasn't simply a mistake,
the best sense I can make of this is that Antimatter is curious to
see what I will do if called to serve on a Board of Appeals on this
CFJ. The answer to which is: I don't know what I will do.

My initial position, which I'm prepared to be argued out of, is that
we should view a single Rule Change as occurring as the result of
just one provision, and that therefore the sentence at issue in P3710
should count as one provision, and one Rule Change.
