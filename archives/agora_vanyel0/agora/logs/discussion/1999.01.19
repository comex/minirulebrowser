What exactly does it mean to be the "creator" of a document?  Surely
there's a better way to phrase this.

Some slight changes to my draft annotation for R693, mainly
so as not to confuse an attempted vote with an actual vote.
If there's no complaints, this will be in the next FLR.

[CFJ 1110 (Judged Dec. 11 1998; Appeal completed Dec. 22 1998) &
 CFJ 1111 (Judged Dec. 22 1998): When the voting period of a proposal
 whose voting period is in progress is changed via amendment of this
 Rule, an attempted vote is effective if (in addition to other
 requirements which may be imposed by the Rules) it was made after the
 start of the voting period and prior to its end, those times being
 determined by the text of this Rule at the time the vote is
 attempted.]

Not entirely.  The creditor may "force the issue" on an overdue debt
by issuing an Order requiring the debt be paid.  Failure to comply
with this Order is Contempt by Inaction, a Class C Crime defined in
Rule 1810.  Hm, might be an idea to make this an Infraction instead of
a Crime.

See above on how Blots can accrue to a Player who does not pay debts
in a timely manner.

The creditor already has the power to compel; I see no point in
vesting that power in a Judge as well.

Can you be more specific?  I'm open to making changes to clarify

Go read the United States Bankruptcy Code and tell me if you still

Do you prefer author?  I suppose I've spent too much time in the

"Fungible" is a pretty obscure word. I think it means that individual
units of Currency are qualitatively identical, ie, no one of them is
different to any other, but this might be worth being explicit about in
the Rules.

The use of "indivisible" here seems to clash with that in (e) below,
unless we identify "unit" with "smallest indivisible unit", a usage
which seems to me to clash with commonsense.

"Tangible" does not appear anywhere else in the proto, nor in the Rules.
What is a "tangible medium of exchange"?

Sorry, I should have been more specific--I don't think "author"
would be any better.  The case I'm concerned about is this:
suppose Steve writes up a proto, then decides it isn't worthwhile
after all.  I think it is, so I attempt to propose it.  Is it a
proposal?  Am I its creator, or is Steve?  If Steve is, we
have a problem, since Steve never labelled it as a Proposal.

Why not "the person" instead of "the entity"? Is there any real prospect
of an entity other than a person ever being a Recordkeepor? Who but a
person could enter into the kinds of agreements outlined in this Rule?

I think the problem may be that you *have* read the United States
Bankruptcy Code, and much other US law besides, and its formalisms and
language are clearly a great influence on your Proposal writing. What on
earth is the word "recused" doing in the Ruleset? We've also got
motions, and stays of motions, and vacations of stays of motions.
Playing the game more and more resembles pursuing an action through the
US legal system.

I realise that I was being unspecific, but it's difficult to do better
than that. It's not so much that there are particular areas that are 
really difficult, it's more that the whole thing seems to be written in
a dialect I am not very familiar with. The words are familiar, but the
meanings are lost on me.

The discussion above illustrates that fact: You clearly believe that
the answers to my questions are already in the Proposal. I could not
find them. I am still not certain where in the Proposal it says the
things you tell me it says.

Am I the only one with this problem? Can anyone else offer some more
helpful criticism?

With respect to the mechanisms you describe, your replacement for 
Persistent Indebtness is kind of one step further removed than it was.
Maybe that's not such a bad thing, but it makes me wonder how often 
such Orders to pay are going to be issued. I imagine that so long as
making such Orders is optional, Players are unlikely to try to compel
payment from players who simply cannot pay. So, unlike the current
system, "bankrupt" players are not likely to be so harshly punished.
Maybe that's a good thing.

But doesn't this also give certain Officers the ability to ignore
their own debts in the currency they control? If they do not issue 
orders to compel themselves to pay, then who will?

Also, on the subject of compelling players to pay their debts, should
we just be punishing players who can pay up but don't, or should we 
actually give creditors the power to seize their assets? Without this
power, you may have to wait until the debtor becomes Lawless, is
deregistered, and the Notary pays off eir debts.

BTW: I like the fact that the Notary can, Without Objection, just return
all currencies to the Bank. It's a nice tradeoff between the need for
Probate and the nuisance thereof in cases where it doesn't matter.

I resubbed to the list because I wanted to publish some info I had
accumulated while I was a Player, and wanted to keep up on any
relevant info (you'll get the results anon). I decided I wouldn't
reregister until the game changed sufficiently (pace G. Chaos, but I
am too pragmatic to enjoy rules lawyering). If you were serious

I guess I should eventually get round to registering sometime.  Maybe in
the next couple of weeks.  I want to think of some good ideas for proposals
first.  Oh and if anyone wants to raise the new players P-note allowance
that would be real nice.

Actually, it's all outstanding POs, not just outstanding VT POs.  The Rule 
reads "At the time the Budget is thus implemented, all outstanding Payment 
Orders are vacated, and all Players' VT holdings are set to the values 
shown in the Budget."  (I thought this was a deliberate set-up for a scam 
when I read the proposal -- was it actually a mistake?)

Actually, all of those except possibly the last (I'm not sure about the 
timestamp on Crito's message) were vacated when the Treasuror implemented 
eir budget on 14Jan99.  Again I quote Rule 1867: "At the time the Budget is 
thus implemented, all outstanding Payment Orders are vacated, and all 
Players' VT holdings are set to the values shown in the Budget."

Good heavens, another Blot amnesty, and another Indulgence flood. How
careless of us!

This reminds me of an idea I once had to make Office(r)s into entities
separate from the Player holding them, with em being the Executor.  I
thought this might clarify issues of what happens with an Officer's
responsibilities when the holder changes (although we now have a specific
Rule for that.)

I intended to react to a completely different article with that remark,
namely the one in which (I think it was General Chaos) talked about giving
the Distributor more responsibilities.

I have no idea what went wrong, and apologize for any ensuing confusion.

It's just I was looking over a report dated 28th december, and it didn't 
mention them.  Also I havn't seen anything written in the forums that 
would suggest that I was about to get them.  I guess I'll get them and 
see them in the next Heralds report though.

Just making sure

Peekee.

The queue orderm surely is the order of priority for the the proposals, 
and so the proposals at the top are the pproposals which most people 
want to see and so their text should be placed first in the reort.

Protoproposal Chaos63 [rev. 5]

Let the Promotor Exercise Judgment

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1483 be amended to read:

|     (a) A Proposal is any document clearly marked as such.

      (b) A Proposal is Proposed when it is posted by a Proposing
          Entity to the Public Forum with the clear indication that it
          is being posted for the purpose of Proposing it.

      (c) A Proposal is not Proposed if, in the Promotor's judgment,
          it is substantially identical to another Proposal Proposed
          within the past three weeks, unless
|       (1) the Proposing Entity posting the Proposal clearly
            indicates at the time of submission that the Proposal is
            intended to become a duplicate of the prior Proposal, or
        (2) the prior Proposal has been discarded or withdrawn, or has
            been distributed and the results of voting upon that
            Proposal have been announced by the Assessor.

      (d) The Promotor's determination that a Proposal has or has not
          been Proposed (including a determination made under
          subdivision (c) of this Rule) is subject to judicial review
          only for abuse of discretion.

      (e) Under no circumstance shall the Promotor's distribution of
          previously undistributed Proposals constitute the submission
          of a new Proposal.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Any CFJ which alleges that an Officer made an error
          regarding a determination of fact where the Rules state that
          such determinations shall be subject to judicial review only
          for abuse of discretion lacks standing and shall be
          dismissed.  (Such CFJs, to have standing, must allege that
          the Officer in question abused discretion in making the
          disputed determination.)

      (b) This Rule takes precedence over all other Rules pertaining
          to when a CFJ has standing, and over all other Rules which
          specify when a CFJ shall be dismissed.

A problem might be that either the proposal group is very inactive, 
causing little change or very radical, in which case they could try to 
force all sorts of changes.  Of course people would try to vote in a 
proposal group which would cause a happy medium between change and 
stability. 

I still think all people should have at least the potential to be able 
to vote, even if they have to "work" to get that right.  As such I don't 
think a voting group as such would be a good idea.

Unlike real life where some people need to be guided, or protected by 
government like agencies.  The people in Agora choose to be here and I 
think are all independent, and capable of choosing how the shape of the 
future should be made.  As such I don't see why all people shouldn't be 
able to vote on, and propose ideas.

I can not see a situation (such as internomic war) where the stability 
of the sort of proposed system would be needed.  This does not mean that 
this is always the case, if there was the possibility of an 
internomicwar I still believe other systems would be able to protect 
Agora, and as such I am not totally opposed to the idea.

Most likely an oversight.  New players are a rare enough occurence
that the various Officers often forget to do everything they're
supposed to when it happens.

This can be safeguarded against by making Proposers subject to

Agora isn't "needed."  We do things here not because they are

Hm, it would appear that you are correct.  I still have a few
questions to check on (namely, whether those vacations could legally
take place) before I take official action, however.

There are a number of ways to do it that prevent stagnation. The
simplest is to allow Players to change their status freely, but
not more than once a month. That way, a balance can be found
naturally, and players can decide for themselves which power they
wish to exercise the most. For obvious reasons, the more Voters,
the more desirable Proposing becomes (since one gets closer to a
monopoly), and vice versa. It'd be interesting to see where the
equilibrium lies.

Likewise, I agree. If people clearly state that they want, not to be 
able to make proposals then that is fine. However, I was stating my own 
opinion, and I think people might think twice before joining a rule 
changing game where they can not propose the rules.

I don't see as the situation of not being able to vote, or not being 
able to propose, at an individual level would be interesting.  Although 
I admit a more strutured "governing" type of group would interesting on 
the whole.

The interest would lie in the need to bargain to get what one
wants, and the strategic choices of when to be a proposer, and when to
be a voter. I think in terms of overall game power, one wouldn't
be giving up much, if anything, since scarcity makes any power more
valuable.

Upon review it appears that the precedence clause in the Treasuror
Rule is sufficiently strong to overcome any procedural irregularity in
the vacations it mandates.

I should think there is enough room in our Ruleset for both.  I would
love to see a substantive body of law arise out of this gleaming tower
of procedural rules.  I, however, am not the person to invent it
(although I'd be more than glad to assist in the process of encoding
it).  My talents appear to lie in giving form to substance, rather
than in creating the substance itself.

I'm at school right now, limited to the use of a 24 line dumb
terminal; when I get home and can use the full glories of X, I'll try
to be more specific in my answer, explaining where I believe the
answers to your questions can be found.  It's too hard for me to have
three documents open at once on this little screen.

Since, I imagine, the primary creditor in the game will be the Bank,
it will be at the Chancellor's discretion to issue such Orders.  We
could, of course, take away the Chancellor's discretion and force the
Chancellor to follow a specific policy with respect to the debts owed
to the Bank.

The other situation, when the Chancellor is deficient in paying off
debts owed by the Bank, will, I imagine, be met with a flurry of
Orders from Players who want their Currencies.  If a Player doesn't
want eir Currencies, e can do nothing.  We could also create a
specific remedy for nonpayment of a Bank debt.

Malcolm> Maybe that's a good thing.

We seem to think that the discretionary application of the "death
penalty" for lawlessness is a good thing, too.  One argument in favor
of discretionary exercise of private (i.e. non-Official) powers is
that it leaves open their use as bargaining chips ("I won't enforce
that debt you owe me if you vote for my Proposal").  When enforcement
is mandatory, that's not available.  

Also note that presently, reporting Perpetual Indebtedness is
discretionary for the _Recordkeepor_, who generally has no interest at
all in the transaction anyway.  The system I propose makes it
discretionary for the creditor, who does.

Malcolm> But doesn't this also give certain Officers the ability to
Malcolm> ignore their own debts in the currency they control? 

The power to enforce a debt would reside with the _creditor_, not the
Currency Recordkeepor.  The Currency Recordkeepor has nothing _at all_
to do with either tracking or enforcing debt in the system I propose;
e only tracks transfers (and creations and destructions).

I suppose it might become possible for someone to have a third-party
interest in a debt; if and when that happens, a remedy can be
constructed, either legislatively or judicially.

Malcolm> Also, on the subject of compelling players to pay their

Note that this same situation exists presently; there is no power of
seizure under the present system either.  When I originally wrote the
Probate Code, I anticipated eventually writing a "bankruptcy" law that
would allow entities to be put in Probate while still empowered with
an Executor, but that never happened.  (Not coincidently, I originally
entertained this notion about the time I myself filed for bankruptcy.)
In any case, if we want to create a seizure power, we can do so by
further legislation; this Proposal does not seek to address that
concern, and to do so would only complicate it further.

Malcolm> BTW: I like the fact that the Notary can, Without Objection,

I may sever this provision and propose it separately, while continuing
to work on developing the main proposal to a form that meets with
general approval.  I think it is generally conceded that the current
Probate system is, um, overweight.

Hmmm... That makes me guilty of one of the three worst Crimes in our Judicial
system, on par only with Speaker Abandonment, and maybe Prosecution. Well, 
let's just hope that the 'reasonable belief'-clause in Rule 1575 applies...

I'm not sure whether it actually purports to satisfy a PO.

Protoproposal Chaos63 [rev. 6]

Let the Promotor Exercise Judgment

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1483 be amended to read:

      (a) A Proposal is any document clearly marked as such.

      (b) A Proposal is Proposed when it is posted by a Proposing
          Entity to the Public Forum with the clear indication that it
          is being posted for the purpose of Proposing it.

      (c) A Proposal is not Proposed if, in the Promotor's judgment,
          it is substantially identical to another Proposal Proposed
          within the past three weeks, unless
        (1) the Proposing Entity posting the Proposal clearly
|           indicates at the time of posting that the Proposal is
            intended to become a duplicate of the prior Proposal, or
        (2) the prior Proposal has been discarded or withdrawn, or has
            been distributed and the results of voting upon that
            Proposal have been announced by the Assessor.

      (d) The Promotor's determination that a Proposal has or has not
          been Proposed (including a determination made under
          subdivision (c) of this Rule) is subject to judicial review
          only for abuse of discretion.

      (e) Under no circumstance shall the Promotor's distribution of
          previously undistributed Proposals constitute the submission
          of a new Proposal.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Any CFJ which alleges that an Officer made an error
          regarding a determination of fact where the Rules state that
          such determinations shall be subject to judicial review only
          for abuse of discretion lacks standing and shall be
          dismissed.  (Such CFJs, to have standing, must allege that
          the Officer in question abused discretion in making the
          disputed determination.)

      (b) This Rule takes precedence over all other Rules pertaining
          to when a CFJ has standing, and over all other Rules which
          specify when a CFJ shall be dismissed.

I'm sorry, Scott, but I think the answer above embodies an approach
I don't particularly care for. From my point of view, pragmatically
speaking, the rules of any game should be as transparent as possible,
to discourage rules lawyering. <rant mode on> I happen to feel that
in your zeal to create rules that would survive in a RW judicial system
you make them needlessly complicated. Take the Currency trading rules
(POs and TOs). I'm not saying they don't make sense. But what at the
core you are trying to simulate is a simple RW process: I have so much
Monopoly money, and I need to give some to you, so I hand you some. A
simulation should not be more convoluted than the process it is trying
to simulate. It's been cleaned up a bit, but it still sometimes seems
as if you'd be better off actually mailing around play money.
Originally, Agora's currency rules were embodied in a few lines, and
they worked. Perhaps they weren't metaphysically rigorous, but in most
cases the common sense of the Players ensured the system functioned at
least as smoothly as your system seems to be doing at present. <rant mode
off> Now, I realize you enjoy writing those kind of rules, and that's
fine. It's just not my cup of tea.

No, it has not, because Salaries are "paid" by issuing Payment
Orders.  Andre has not yet fulfilled his Registrarial duty to issue
the appropriate Payment Order.

I also note that if the transfer actually took place, Andre has
committed Misappropriation, a Class A Crime.

Not if (as Andre has already pointed out) he believed he was not

Actually, I try to write rules that survive in Agora's scam-happy
environment.  The sort of rules you want will be scammed left, right,
up, down, forwards and backwards by the inveterate rule lawyers that
have always inhabited Agora.  Don't blame me for that; it had that
character when I joined.

Really?  I seem to recall that they were scammed several times.  My
entire goal is to write unscammable rules, which is no mean feat in an 
environment filled with scam artists.  I'd be more than happy to play
in a game where we could live with plain language rules, and let
common sense dictate how the ambiguities that are inherent in plain
language rules will be interpreted.  Agora is not, and as far as I can 
tell, never has been, such a game.

For what it's worth, I'd be interested in a game with an emphasis on
plain language rules.  Such an environment is rife for opportunities
for the judicial creation of law, something which we see precious
little of in Agora.  (There are far too few CFJs in Agora for my
taste.)

Possibly.  (Actually the Bankruptcy Code isn't that bad.  The Internal
Revenue Code, on the other hand, is insane.)  I am, after all, a law
student.  It should be noted that there is little consistency in style
amongst American lawmakers, though, and that you are probably
crediting too much of my style to the influence of the United States
Code.

Oh, hell, I wrote most of that before I was particularily familiar
with American civil procedure.  Case in point: the use and meaning of
the word "standing" in Agora with respect to CFJs is completely
different than that in American civil procedure.  Except from the
material I have presented in the past six months to a year, I would
say that my efforts have been more informed by "The People's Court,"
"LA Law," and "Law and Order" than the actuality of American law.

I had an idea for a thesis on the nature of property in Agora; maybe I 
should write it up sometime.  (I'm taking Property this semester,
which is what impelled me to consider the notion.)

Protoproposal Chaos72 [rev. 1]

Simplify Probate

Be it therefore resolved, that Rules 1637, 1738, 1739 and 1757 be
repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1601 be amended to read:

      (a) An entity is inanimate if it:
        (1) possesses any number of units of Currency, and
        (2) does not have an Executor.

      (b) The Notary may perform any of the following with respect to
          a inanimate entity:
        (1) transfer Currencies owned by the inanimate entity for the
            purpose of satisfying a Payment Order naming the inanimate
            entity as payor;
          (A) Without Objection, vacate any Payment Order naming the
              inanimate entity as payor or payee; or
          (B) Without Objection, transfer Currencies owned by that
              entity to the Bank.
        (2) The Notary is authorized, all other Rules notwithstanding,
            to transfer Currency from any inanimate entity to any
            other entity as if e were the inanimate entity's Executor,
            when e is permitted to do so in accordance with
            subdivision (b) of this Rule.
        (3) A inanimate entity is considered to continue to have legal
            existence as long as it continues to possess units of
            Currency, even if it is dissolved, destroyed, or otherwise
            would cease to have legal existence prior to that time. 
            An entity which has legal existence solely as a result of
            this subdivision is called "terminal".

It's not too late, but that '2824' still needs to be changed to '3824'.

The first three month trial of A Duty to Vote (from Oct. 16 to Jan. 16),
almost exactly coincided with the period during which no Accountor's
Reports were issued (making it very difficult to determine who had
effective control of what assets), the Voting Token part of the economy
was shut down, and voting was made free. So the concept has not really
had a proper trial. Hence, I'm reproposing this. There's one small
change: the penalties for Failure to Vote are slightly stiffer in this
version.

####
Proto-Proposal
A Duty to Vote

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule entitled "A Duty to Vote" be created
with the following text:

      An Active Player with effective control of more than three Voting
      Tokens at the time a batch of Proposals is distributed, who is not
      denied Voting Privileges at that time, who is Active at the end of
      the Voting Period of the Proposal in the batch whose Voting Period
      finishes latest, and who fails to cast a vote on any Proposal in
      the batch, commits the Infraction of Failure to Vote, to be
      detected and reported by the Assessor. The penalty for commission
      of this Infraction is one Indulgence, and a number of Voting
      Tokens equal to the Voting Tariff for the batch, or one, whichever
      is greater.

      Effective control of an asset (e.g., a unit of Currency) is the
      ability to dispose of that asset as one wishes. The Assessor is
      empowered to make determinations as to whether a Player has
      effective control over a particular asset at a particular time.
      Such determinations may be overturned by the Courts.

      Three months after this Rule is created, it repeals itself.

Well, I wasn't thinking of making people commit permanently to one group
or the other. The simplest system would be to let people move relatively
freely back and forth (I was thinking once every two months).

Restricting the number of Legislators would make it a bit harder to get
into that group (which is the point, obviously), but would make things
interesting for those Players who wanted to be in it.

I'm tending at the moment to the view that Legislator positions should
be sold at Auction. We have enough Elections around here already.

Not being able to vote for your own Proposals means working harder on
the lobbying side of things to get your Proposals passed. And if you
want to make Proposals, but you're not a Legislator, then you're either
going to have to think about becoming a Legislator yourself, or
convincing an existing Legislator to make it for you.

Do we? Satre would argue otherwise. Maybe we are "doomed to be free". :)

Indeed. I'm surprised at this argument coming from Peekee, who just 
defended eir Commodities system on the basis that it might be fun, even
if it wasn't "useful".

There are now 45 Indulgences in circulation, and only 6 Blots. Didn't
Crito get a Rule passed to deal with this situation the last time it
happened?

I like the idea (especially since it makes my Auction proposal more useful)
but may I suggest that we also allow the Speaker to act as a Legislator,
so that there is always one "popularly elected" Legislator - kind of a
public representative, for those who are too poor to buy their own position.

Not quite! The test in R1575 is "*reasonable* belief", not merely
belief. Did Andre have a reasonable belief that transferring funds from
the Bank without a Payment Order to justify them was not a Crime? That's
not nearly so clear.

I don't want to persecute Andre for what was clearly an innocent
mistake. But I'm interested to see where this leads...

I doubt that is going to happen - there are enough P-Notes is the system
as it is. Few players seem very interested in using them - perhaps you 
could buy or borrow some cheaply.

I'll repeat my offer to risk-share on any Proposal. I'll pay 1 P-Note to
raise the Priority of any proposal I think is a reasonable risk, in return
for 2 P-Notes if the Proposal passes, and nothing if it fails.

Actually, if we reduced the MUQ of P-Notes to 0.1, I'd be happy to make
this offer on any portion of a P-Note. Say, I pay 0.5 P-Notes to raise
Priority, then you can pay me back double - 1 P-Note - when it passes.
That way we do actually share the risk. You risk 0.5 P-Notes, and so do
I. If it suceeds, you get 1 P-Note, and so do I.

I think I'll proto such a change to the MUQ.

At first I thought you meant that we should make the Speaker a
Legislator. That troubled me because I want to make the Speaker as
attractive a position as possible, and removing eir choice as to whether
to be a Legislator or a Voter seemed to work against that.

On second reading, it occurs to me that you probably meant that we
should give the Speaker the special privilege of being both a Legislator
and a Voter at the same time. I think that's certainly worth
considering.

I also like the idea of having a mixture of Elected and Auctioned
Legislator positions.

Question: assuming that we're going to restrict the number of
Legislators, how many Legislators should there be? My original thought
was four, but if we want the positions to be highly sought after, then
perhaps three would be a better number, perhaps one Elected and two
Auctioned. (In this scenario, I'd probably drop the Speaker/Legislator
idea.)

I haven't checked the records, but I suspect that Lee is guilty of
the Infraction of Inciting to Riot (R1840). I leave it up to the Registrar
to decide whether to report this. 

Considering the timing information needed to execute this rule, it would
probably be worthwhile for the Registrar to keep track of the date a
player last Rebelled, as part of the Red Pages, and the number of times
e has changed status since the last Revolt.

I believe that Crito has been the Treasuror since the Election results
were announced. Not that it matters much; R1867 must be close to
repealing itself, if it hasn't already.

I'm toying with a number of different ideas, not all of which are
consistent with each other. I haven't settled on a final model yet.

The 'free choice' model is simpler, but less interesting to my way of
thinking. Nevertheless, considering the complexity involved in this
idea, it might be best to install the free choice model first and play
with that for a while, and get any bugs out of it. Then we could
consider some of the more complicated ideas I've been throwing around
with Blob later on. It would also give us the chance to see where the
natural equilibrium is, which would be useful information.

I agree that this might be a good idea.

I think I like the idea of three Auctioned Legislators, plus the
Speaker as both Legislator and Voter.  Alternatively, two Auctioned,
two Elected, and the Speaker doing double duty.  The problem, as I see
it, is that only three Players have made more than 2 Proposals in the
last three months.

Four is about right for 15 or 16 players, I feel - but if we are going to
have a limit, it will need to vary as players come and go. At a guess, I
choose 1/4 the number of Players, rounding up.

I still don't like this clause. I would prefer to keep it as a 1 VT (and
possbly, 1 Blot) penalty.

One suggestion: allow a Player to change whenever e wishes; but a
Player cannot Vote on a Proposal unless e was a Voter _at the time it
was distributed_, and a Player cannot make a Proposal unless e was a
Legislator at the start of the Nomic Week in which e seeks to make it.
(This may be abusable by the Promotor.  Have to think about it.)

This is why I tend to think that three Legislators might be a better
number than four. In Blob's terms, perhaps 1/5 of the number of Players,
rounded down (not up). 

But in line with my remarks to Vlad, i think I'm going to worry about
this further down the track.

Proto-Proposal
Clearing the ground

[Comment: I very much want to employ a distinction between Legislators
and Voters in my forthcoming Separation of Powers proto. But there's a
snag: the term "Voters" is already used in Rules 103, 112 and 1043, with
the meaning "Players other than the Speaker" - an archaism left over
from the long distant days when the Speaker was not allowed to vote.
So, to clear away the terminological ground for A Separation of Powers,
I make the following Proposal.]

This Proposal shall have an Adoption Index of 3.

Be it hereby resolved that R103 have its Title changed to "Exactly One
Speaker", and that it be amended to read:

      At any time, there is exactly one Speaker.

[Do we really need this? The other provisions certainly are superfluous.
Can we repeal R103 altogether?]

Be it further resolved that R112 be amended by deleting from it the
paragraph which reads:

      If no other Rule defining a way to Win exists, then a Player
      Wins upon each Winter and Summer Solstice, and upon each Vernal
      and Autumnal Equinox, with the Winner being chosen randomly by
      the Speaker from among all Voters not on Hold who are not
      ineligible to Win because of an applicable Win-preventing Rule.

[This provision was inserted over 3 years ago, when winning still
triggerred a Speaker transition. With regular quarterly Speaker
Transitions now in place, we can get rid of it.]

Be it further resolved that R1043 (Deregistration) be amended to read:

      A Player other than the Speaker may deregister from Agora by
      sending a message to the Public Forum announcing eir
      deregistration. A Player who deregisters in this fashion ceases to
      be a Player effective at the time date-stamped on that message,
      and any attempts by em to reregister before thirty days have
      passed are without effect. This Rule takes precedence over Rules
      which would cause em to be reregistered before thirty days have
      passed after eir deregistration.

[I've made another slight change here: "before thirty days have passed"
has replaced "before the beginning of the next month". I cannot see why
a player who deregisters voluntarily near the end of a month should be
treated any differently from one who does so near the beginning.]

Actually, I think that was Kolja.  And I'll have to double-check, but I think
that only applies to Revolutions.

I'm not sure I understand...I thought you said Players could change
their status freely every so often. I like the idea of letting the
ratio find its own level through the decisions of players.

We had this discussion before. Certainly I think the Blot penalty is
justified. Failure to Propose carries a P-Note + Blot penalty, and I
think Failure to Vote should be similar. As for the the VT penalty, I'm
still convinced by the argument that if the penalty is fixed at 1 VT,
then when the Voting Tariff is greater than 1 VT, as it is now, then the
Duty to Vote actually becomes an inducement not to vote at all! To my
mind that's just silly.

I think setting a limit on the frequency of changes increases
the strategic value of the position. Perhaps limit the amount of
time that can be spent at one position. One could also replace
a duty to vote and a duty to propose with appropriate requirements
for legislators and voters.
