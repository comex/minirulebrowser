Our definitions appear to differ. I say it's an example of 
modification: it modifies the effect to the exact opposite. The thing 
which indicates to me that it's a modification, clarification, or
limitation of the rest of the rule is that the subject of the 
sentence is "this rule". In the rule "X is three. X is four.", there 
are two provisions which modify X to different values, generating a 
contradiction. In the rule "X is three. This rule makes X four.", 
there is no contradiction, because the first provision modifies X, 
while the second provision modifies the first provision to modify X 
differently.

So: If a rule says "X is Y.", it modifies X to be Y. If it says "This 
rule makes X Y.", it modifies itself to modify X to be Y, 
"overwriting" any provision which would make X something other than 
Y. If it says "This rule makes this rule make X Y.", it modifies 
itself to modify itself to modify X to Y, "overwriting" any provision 
which would make it modify itself to make X something other than Y, 
and also overwriting any provision which would make X something other 
than Y.

Is my system clear now?

ProtoProposal Chuck 115.1
Removing Rule Annotations Without Objection

I request that this Proposal have AI=1.

Rule 789 is amended by changing the text which currently reads:

      The Rulekeepor may remove such an annotation only if that Rule
      is repealed, or when required to do so by a valid Order.

to read:

      The Rulekeepor may remove such an annotation only if that
      Rule is repealed; when required to do so by a valid Order;
      the original Order to Annotate is amended, stayed, or
      vacated; or Without Objection.

Rule 1500 is amended by changing the text which currently reads:

      The Maintainer of that SLC may remove such an annotation only
      when the SLC ceases to exist, or when required to do so by a
      valid Order.

to read:

      The Maintainer of that SLC may remove such an annotation only
      when the SLC ceases to exist; when required to do so by a valid
      Order; when the original Order to Annotate is amended, stayed,
      or vacated; or Without Objection.

[Comments: The OR amendment got rid of the list of Relevant Rules,
which means that if an interpretation is critically dependent on
a Rule other than the one being annotated, it may persist after
that Rule is amended, even if it should not.  Allowing the
annotation to be removed Without Objection will allow such
annotations to be removed without a court order.

Also clarifies that if an order to annotation is amended, stayed,
or vacated, the Rulekeepor/Maintainer need not continue to
supply the original annotation.

I usually provide the title of Rules to be changed in my
Proposals, but I'm attempting to change the titles of these
WO, so I haven't included them here.]

------------------------------------------------------------

ProtoProposal Chuck116.1
Correcting the "Impossible Speaker"

I request that this Proposal have AI=1.

Rule 1829 ("Refusal of Duty by the Speaker") is amended to read:

      If the Speaker is convicted of the Crime of Contempt by
      Action, or of the Crime of Contempt by Inaction, relating
      to a validly issued Order to Compel which was directed at
      the position of Speaker, the Speaker becomes Tainted.

[Comments: Despite what R1829 currently says, an Impossible
Speaker is *not* defined elsewhere.  This corrects that.  Also,
it limits the relevant orders to compel to those incurred *as
Speaker*--the current version of 1829 would allow penalties
against the Speaker for orders to compel which applied to
the Speaker, but were not directed to the position of Speaker.

Should there be some provision for a delay in the case of
an appeal of the conviction?

*Can* a person be convicted of Contempt by Action relating to
an Order to Compel?  It seems, judging from R1509, that
Orders to Compel can only compel action, not inaction, but
I'm not sure about that.]

------------------------------------------------------------

ProtoProposal Chuck117.1
Limitations on Time Requirements of Orders

I request that this Proposal have AI=1.

Rule 1795 ("Timing Requirements of Orders") is amended by
changing the text which currently reads:

      An Order which commands the performance of an action may specify
      when that action is to be performed; if no specification is
      given, or if the specification given would require the
      performance of the action at a time when the Order is without
      effect, the Order shall be taken to require the performance of
      the action as soon as possible after the Order takes effect.

to read:

      An Order which commands the performance of an action may specify
      when that action is to be performed; if no specification is
      given, or the the specification given would require the
      performance of the action at a time when the Order is without
      effect, or if the specification given would allow less than
      72 hours from the time when the Order takes effect to perform
      the action, then the Order shall be taken to require the
      performance of the action as soon as possible after the Order
      takes effect.

      If an Order which commands the performance of an action is
      directed to an Office or other position of authority; and the
      holder of that position of authority changes after the Order
      takes effect, but before the Order is satisfied; and the
      specification would require the performance of the action at a
      time before the current holder of the position came to hold
      that position, or would allow less than 72 hours from the time
      the current holder of the position came to hold that position;
      then the Order shall be taken to require the performance of the
      action as soon as possible after the current holder of the
      position came to hold that position.  However, this shall
      not be taken to absolve the previous holder of the position
      of any penalties e might otherwise incur.

[Comments: Sets a minimum of 3 days to perform any action required
by Order.  Also allows a reasonble time for new Office-holders
to satisfy requirements of Orders.

The wording is ugly, especially in the second paragraph.  Any
suggestions for improvement would be welcome.]

------------------------------------------------------------

ProtoProposal Chuck118.1
Precedence Clause for Rule 1814

I request that this Proposal have AI=1.

Rule 1814 ("Timing of Penalties for Crimes and Infractions")
is amended by appending a sentence which reads:

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which specifies
      a different penalty for a Crime or Infraction.

[Comments: Rule 1814 tries to specify that the penalty for
a Crime or Infraction is the one that applied at the time
the Crime or Infraction was committed, but lacks the necessary
precedence clause to make it work as intended.]

------------------------------------------------------------

And a question, also relating somewhat to precedence clauses:
Rule 1798 reads

Rule 1798/0 (Power=1)
I Was Only Obeying Orders

      A Player who performs as required by an Order which is later
      found to be invalid is not liable for eir actions; but other
      Rules may establish procedures for correcting or remedying
      such circumstances when they occur.

What exactly does it mean that a Player is "not liable for eir
actions"?  If it means that that Player shall not be penallized,
isn't a precedence clause necessary?

These reports are convenient, but they do not fulfill the conditions 
of the second paragraph of 1738 that must be met before the ASAP 
obligation on a Trustee is imposed, as they have not been sent by the 
Players who are required (under ASAP requirements, btw) to send them.

>From R1738 :

      As soon as possible after the Notary announces the appointment
      of a Trustee for an entity in Probate, each Recordkeepor, with
      respect to the Currency of which e is the Recordkeepor, shall
      provide to that Trustee an accounting of the number of units of
      that Currency held by the entity in Probate, and a list of all
      Payment Orders naming the entity in Probate as either Payor or
      Payee.

      As soon as possible after the Trustee has received all of the
      reports required by the previous paragraph, e shall formulate
      and announce in the Public Forum a Plan for the disposition of
      the estate of the entity in Probate according to the provisions
      of the Probate Code.

Specifically, in the case of Andre's Probate, this has been done for
VTs, Indulgences, and P-Notes as part of the required weekly
Currency Reports, but not for Irises; and Harlequin definitely did
not send me a listing of the amounts of that Currency held by Andre
since e was placed in my Trust. I suspect that 1738 also requires
Jester to fulfill this obligation before its third paragraph can
have effect, although I'm not quite sure; but that is not yet
relevant.

If you must cite someone for Tardiness, then, let it be Harlequin -
and I must also ask you to vacate that improperly executed PO for
Indulgences.

Actually, I think I'm wrong - the Recordkeepor for Irises seems to be
yourself, not Harlequin. If that is the case, your latest report
about the Iris holdings of Players in Probate was on January 12,
about 11 days before Andre deregistered, and I'm not aware that
there have been any such reports since.

For the reasons I just outlined, these Infraction Reports are also
improper with respect to Sherlock, Blob and Time Agent - the Trustee
assignment in each case was effected on Jan. 22, 1998, and since
that time there has been no report issued by Kolja A., Recordkeepor
for Irises, on the holdings of the Players who the aforementioned
where assigned as Trustees for. I also note that Kolja A. is
consequently guilty of four separate counts of Tardiness in not 
issuing these reports.

Murphy's assignment as Zefram's Trustee seems to predate the Jan. 22
date, but I haven't yet ascertained whether it predates Kolja A.'s 
Jan. 12 report on Irises holdings, so I'm not sure whether the above 
report of Infraction is improper with respect to Murphy or not.

Fair enough.  I've changed this (your entry has picked up an asterisk
so that I don't forget your time-zone).  The problem is that your
posts of the ruleset still don't have a proper time-stamp, though your
other posts are all OK.

I'm quite aware of that. I just seemed to remember that all

the notary got the information listed in eir report in the first
place.

Specifically, in the case of Andre's Probate, this has been done for

Ok, if that is the case, the trustees have not done anything wrong. I
guess the same applies to the other cases of probate. 

I hereby vacate POs tardy1, tardy3, tardy4, tardy5, tardy6, tardy8,
tardy9 and tardy10, because the infraction of tardiness was not reylla
committed by the trustees penalized by these POs.

BTW, IIRC the recordkeepor for Irises is the Order's High Priest;
while it is true that I was High Priest for some time, and did publish
Iris information for the entities in probate at the beginning of the
year, that position is now held by Harlequin again.

OK, time to ask the mail gurus here (Oerjan?)  Most of my
mail goes out through elm, and the time-stamp is fine.
The Rulesets are sent by perl scripts which call /usr/lib/sendmail,
and these lack the numeric time zone indication.  Is there some
way to get sendmail to include a numeric timezone indication?
If not directly, can I have my perl script insert a date header
and have it override the sendmail-inserted date header?

I think you can roll your own date line, but I'm not sure.  However,
CST is a "standard time zone designator" and is legal as it stands.

Never mind, I tried it myself and discovered that a timestamp
written to sendmail will override the one supplied by sendmail
itself, so I'll modify my scripts to insert a Date: header.

DIS: On Null-Amendments

I would agree with this interpretation.  Ignoring a provision is not a null
amendment, it is no amendment at all.

-- Crito


>>> "Charles E. Carroll" <ccarroll@dfw.net> 03/24/98 10:36pm >>>
It has long been a game custom that if an adopted Proposal
specifies that in a given Rule, text A is to be replaced
with text B, and text A does not exist in the Rule, a null-amendment
is applied to that Rule.

However, I was looking at Rule 594 recently, and I believe that
that practice has been in error, at least since R594 took
it current form:

      When a Proposal is adopted, its Power becomes equal to its
      Adoption Index, and the provisions contained in the text of the
      Proposal are implemented to the maximal extent permitted by the
      Rules.  Provisions which are unclear, ambiguous, or inapplicable
      are ignored.  In a Proposal containing more than one provision,
      each provision is severable from the others, unless the Proposal
      states otherwise.

It seems to me that replacing A with B, when A does not exist,
constitutes an inapplicable provision, and thus it is
ignored, meaning that no amendment, not even a null one, occurs.

Comments?

You appear to believe that in a conflict, the second Rule has precedence
over the Rule "Threat Trombones".  This has never been true.  If 3710 has
passed, Threat Trombones got the lower Rule number.

Whoops, you're right, although if 3710 has passed, the Rules therein
have not yet been assigned numbers.

Because they are horribly ambiguous...

One of the Pine developers used the example of BST, which can mean British
Standard Time or Bering Standard Time.

Actually, it was only British Standard Time for a couple of years in
the 1960s, when there was an experiment with keeping the UK on UTC+0100
all year round.  More commonly BST refers to British Summer Time (also
UTC+0100), the UK daylight saving timezone.

Which raises an interesting question: what is the precedence between
two Rules, one of which does not have a number?

Since when ? If the changeover occurred at any time after Jan. 30 or 
so, you should cite yourself for Tardiness as a consequence of not 
having published the information required ASAP by Rule 1738. If it 
occurred before that, then you should cite Harlequin. You are of 
course not required to do so, but I am considering deKudoing you for 
excessive zeal in policing us hapless Trustees when you should have 
first made sure your own (or the Order's) obligations were properly
carried out. ;)

(The smiley's to convey that I'm good-humoured over the loss of 2
Points and not taking all this too seriously, but I mean it about the 
Kudo.)

I think you're missing a word in the above? "..._when_ [or perhaps 'if']
the original Order..."

I really think you've been a little remiss in taking it on yourself
not to assign Numbers to the Rules created by P3710. I think there is
a reasonable legal presumption, not yet overturned by the Courts,
that the Proposal passed. If the Courts do eventually find this
presumption to be mistaken, then so be it, but in the meantime your
refusal to assign the Rules Numbers is only making things
unnecessarily complicated.
