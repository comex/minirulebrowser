...has 29 Proposals in it. Time to increase the Batch Size, perhaps?

Yes, the Proposal queue has many Proposals in it, but few of them have
non-zero priority. If I increase the batch size then next week I will only
be distributing half a batch.

This is incomplete: it doesn't specify what the holdings of non-Player
entities, including the Bank, are to be after the Budget is implemented.

Thanks Steve, I forgot about that. Will issue a revision soon.

Those bugs aside, what do you think about the genereal idea of the
Proposal?

I would also appreciate your (or anyone else's) insight into the 
precedence issues with my other proto "Let everyone have a turn".
Specifically, what should be the relationship between that rule and
R698?

I think it's an interesting idea. Obviously I wish it were not
necessary, but just as obviously, we cannot continue indefinitely
without an Accountor's Report. So, if we are to have a reset, I think
this is an amusing way of conducting it. I wonder what Scott, who hates
resets, thinks?

A conflict will arise when everyone has had their turn and no Players
are eligible to be selected as Judge: your proposed new Rule will say in
that case that (only) Players made ineligible to Judge by that Rule
should then be made eligible to be selected, while R698 will insist on
the contrary that all Active Players should be made eligible. Since R698
already claims precedence over your Rule, and has a lower Number, R698
will have to be amended in some way. One way would be to amend (ie
weaken) the precedence clause in R698. That may, however, be
complicated. My suggestion would be to look at amending R698 so that it
does not conflict with your proposed Rule; the question of precedence
would then be moot. This could be done by having R698 explicitly provide
that it operates (ie it tests for the truth of the conditions in its
provisions) only after all other Rules affecting the eligibility of
Judges have had their effects regarding Player eligibility in particular
cases.

I only have one P-Note to spend.  The only real way to get P-Notes is
to make Proposals, which requires P-Notes.  My extreme paucity of
P-Notes (note that a new player gets five) makes it infeasible to
support my own Proposals; the best I can do is launch them and hope
someone is generous enough (or interested enough) to fund them.

You could, of course, exercise Promotor's Privilege to increase the
number of non-zero-priority Proposals.

The obvious solution to me is for us to get an Accountor who can and
will produce an Accountor's Report; once we have that, we can proceed.
(I also dispute that we obviously cannot continue indefinitely without
an Accountor's Report; we seem to be doing quite well without one at
the present.)  I see no need for a reset, especially if my Proposal
regarding the evidentiary status of Officer's Reports gets adopted.

Well, I really wasn't trying to blame you for doing what you do. There
is nothing to criticise about your "strategy", IMHO, no matter why you
chose it.

What is your choice is how actively you try to convince other
players to support (i.e. invest P-notes in) your proposals. I haven't
seen any activity of yours in that direction. Again, that is perfectly
acceptable and fine - my only point is that I wonder how many of your
proposals will make it to distribution. But I'm wondering about this
just out of curiosity.

What kinds of facts did I presume? I hope I didn't say anything you
understood as an attack on yourself or your game actions. I just note
that so far you seem to be investing a considerable amount of effort
into producing, protoing and improving your proposals, and then just
leave them to themselves when they reach the proposal queue. Which is
fine with me, but also an object of my attention, because I am curious
what will become out of all your hard work.

Just sending a message to tell you I have started reading Agora
again. The last few months I was subscribed to a-b and a-o, but
redirected them to another folder I never read. Now they go straight
to my mailbox again, and I have subscribed to a-d as well.

I intend to rejoin the game after I have gone through the
ruleset.

I will pay to advance my own Proposals as I get P-Notes to do so
with.  However, I will not spend my last P-Note without good cause.
So I will be advancing some of these Proposals to Votes slowly, over
the next several months.  Of course, I would be more than happy to see
others advance them as well. :)

I may be in error here but as someone who may soon be a new player, I
checked the rules and it seems that a new player starts with only 1 P-Note
and 5 VTs.

You're right.  I should read the Rules more often. :)

Well... we have essentially disabled the entire VT economy. You may be
happy to continue that way indefinitely, but I am not very happy with
it.

Well, you could try spending the one P-Note you have raising the
Priority of that Proposal which you think most likely to pass
unanimously. That's what I'd do.

After that, there's always trade. I have P-Notes. Make me an offer.

I don't think we're doing "quite well": we've had to set the Voting
Tariff and the BOS to zero to reduce the number of POs. Essentially,
we've put the entire VT part of the economy on hold while we wait for
lee to catch up - and there's no guarantee that he is going to catch up.
We also don't know what state his records are in. One suspects they are
in a very bad way. In any case, it is certain to be very difficult, and
it may be impossible, for a new Accountor to produce a Report.

You seem to have left some changebars in the final version.

Poppycock.  It is trivially easy for a new Accountor to produce a
Report.  It will almost certainly contain errors, but I, at least,
will be satisfied if the Report represents a good faith effort.

Actually, they get inserted automatically; in this case they arose
because I fixed a bug in the prettyprinter.  I suppose I could just
repropose it to get rid of them, or let the Rulekeepor decide how to
deal with them if/when it gets adopted.

Maybe, maybe not. If you don't ask, you'll never know. Why don't you try
offering me something you *would* be willing to trade and see how I
respond? The worst that can happen is that I won't be interested.

One obvious approach would be to ask for a loan. If, as seems likely,
most of your current proposals pass, then you should be in the posession
of a considerable number of P-Notes thereafter. You could take a loan
now and pay it back later. If Steve isn't willing to do this, I'd be 
happy to arrange terms with you.
