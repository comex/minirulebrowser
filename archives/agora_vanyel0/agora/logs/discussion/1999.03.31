Well, we could add a three-month self-repealing clause that said Steve
wasn't allowed to Object.  :-)

Fellow Agorans,

I'll pay 0.5 VTs or 1 P-note to the first person who has not already
voted or declared Presence on P3850 to declare Presence on that
Proposal.

Steve

Only 1.2 of those P-Notes were need to get the Proposal over the
Bar. I did keep my promise to raise its Priority by 0.5. Oh, well.

What changes, specifically, are you talking about? Scott's huge raft of
Proposals in the queue are mostly just formatting changes. I don't hear
a huge outcry demanding that these Proposals be adopted. I know I can
live without them.

Perhaps you have other things in mind, though. So, I'll make this
counter-offer. Assuming the existence of a large number of individually
worthy but trivial changes that need to be made (eg spelling corrections
and such like), if you are prepared to put them all into a single
Proposal as I have suggested, I'll not only raise its Priority to see
that it gets distributed, but I'll vote for it, too. If the changes
still are not adopted, then I'll reconsider my opposition to Summary
Adoption - but not before. I think the onus is fairly upon you to show
that the current ways and means are insufficient to the purpose.

But first things first: what changes do you have in mind?

By the way, Scott, if you're going to indulge in making slurs of this
kind (actual arguments evidently not being to hand), the very least you
could do is to get your facts straight. At the time you wrote this,
three Players - Crito, Macross and Vlad - had more VTs than I do.
(Macross has since deregistered.)

Doh! I voted already.  However, I'm only going to vote on your proposals

I quite specifically said that I was talking about Players who Object
*not because of the content of the Proposal, but because they object to
the mechanism*. Your Objection to "Simplify Probate" clearly does not
fall under that description. My Objection to "Zero Payment Orders",
however, does - and what has been the response to it? Well, it's only
been a few days, but already Scott has commenced a campaign of spreading
lies and slander about me, accusing me of hypocrisy, questioning my
motivations and insulting me. Probably there's more of that to come. I'm
reasonably thick-skinned (Swann once compared me to Hitler, and I'm
still here), but even so, I can't say that it gives me much pleasure to
be the object of such tactics. If they were to be employed at greater
length and with greater intensity - who knows? Perhaps I'd start to
think about deregistering.

I'd appreciate comments on this idea.  When I first made the attached
proto it didn't prompt any reactions whatsoever.  However, I think it
would be quite a nice way of encouraging 'economic' activity by making
P-Notes a use-it-or-lose-it currency, without having to resort to the
blunt weapon of taxation.  Moreover, it might be interesting to see
trade in P-Notes of varying expiry dates (what sort of premium would
an Immortal P-Note command?)

One thing not addressed in the proto as it stands is how current
holdings should be converted.  My current feeling is that all extant
P-Notes should be turned into ones that will expire at the end of the
month following the passage of the proposal.

Michael.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Create a rule with the title "Expiring Currencies" and the following
text (up to the line of ten hyphens):

The rules may specify that certain currencies are "expiring".  Each
unit of such a currency (i.e., an amount of that currency equal to its
MUQ) is functionally indistinguishable from all others, except that
any given unit may have an expiry date associated with it.  This
expiry date may only be changed by methods explicitly allowed in the
rules.  Further an expiry date is always the last day of a month, so
allowing terminology which associates units with particular months
(the month at the end of which they will expire).

A unit of an expiring currency that does not have an expiry date is
known as Immortal.  Units of an expiring currency with the same
expiries (whether a given month, or Immortal) are indistinguishable.
Units of an Expiring Currency of any expiry date may be minted without
restriction by the Chancellor.

At the end of each month, all units of an expiring currency with an
expiry date of that month become useless, and the Recordkeepor for the
Currency in question need no longer record them as being in any
Entity's possession.  They have effectively disappeared.

The Recordkeepor for an Expiring Currency must keep track of how many
units all Entities own, subdivided by unit expiry times.

Payment Orders required by the rules for an expiring currency may not
specify that a unit of a particular expiry be paid.  However, when a
transfer is made, the transferring Entity may specify which units are
transferred.

----------

Create a rule with the title "Extending an Expiring Unit's Lifetime"
and the following text (up to the line of ten hyphens):

An Entity in control of a unit of an Expiring Currency with an expiry
date may extend that date by a month by transferring either an
Indulgence or another unit of the same Currency with the same expiry
date to the Bank, simultaneously notifying the Currency Recordkeepor
that e is doing so, and as long as the transfer is not satisfying any
Payment Order.

----------

Amend the rule "Proposal Notes" (R1701/5) by replacing the sentence
"Proposal Notes (P-Notes) are a Currency." with the sentence "Proposal
Notes (P-Notes) are an Expiring Currency."

----------

Amend "Currency Awards for New Players" (R1677/5) by replacing the
current text with "As soon as possible after the start of a Player's
Grace Period, the Registrar shall pay out to that Player 5 Voting
Tokens, and 1 P-Note with an expiry date of the second month after the
month of the Player's registration."

----------

Create a rule with the title "New P-Notes randomly distributed" and
the following text (up to the line of ten hyphens):

As soon as possible after the beginning of the month, the Promotor
shall pay out a number of P-Notes to the Players at large.  The number
to be paid out shall be the number of proposals distributed in the
previous month.  The expiry date on each P-Note so distributed will be
the month following the month just begun.

The recipients of the P-Notes to be distributed will be determined
randomly as follows:
  1) Every unemployed Player will have one chance
  2) Every Officer will have a number of chances equal to the sum of
     the Basic Officer Salary numbers for the Offices that they hold
     divided by 0.5.
  3) Then, for each P-Note to be distributed, the Promotor will
     randomly pick a Player such that their chance of being the
     recipient is equivalent to the chance of their name being pulled
     from a hat with all the Players' names in it, where there are as
     many copies of a Player's name as that Players has the chances
     defined in clauses 1) and 2) above.
  4) Further, when a Player is determined to be the recipient of one
     of the P-Notes, one copy of their name is removed from the
     conceptual hat specified above for all subsequent determinations
     of recipients.  Thus, an Officer filling just one post with a BOS
     of 1.0, can receive at most 2 P-Notes from this distribution.

Having determined the number and recipients of the new P-Notes, the
Promotor shall then order the Bank to pay out these P-Notes to the
specified recipients.

----------

Amend "Reward for getting a proposal passed" (R833/12) by replacing
the phrase "two Proposal Notes" with "one Proposal Note with an expiry
date of the sixth month after the end of this month".

----------

Amend "Bonus for Repeal" (R947/12) by replacing the phrase "1 P-Note"
with "1 VT".

----------

Amend "The Right of Patronage" (R1661/5) by inserting the following
two sentences after the sentence which ends "one Currency Minted by
the Bank": "If the Speaker specifies a unit of an Expiring Currency
then, this unit will usually have an expiry date of the month after
the current month.  However, once a month, the Speaker may specify an
Immortal unit of an Expiring Currency."

Protoproposal Chaos66 [rev. 5]

Cleanup of R.1006

Be it resolved, that Rule 1006 be amended to read:

      (a) An Office is any position established by the Rules as such.

      (b) At any time, a given Office is held by exactly one Player. 
          If an Office would otherwise not be held by any Player, it
          shall be held by the Speaker.

      (c) An Officer is any Player who holds an Office.

      (d) A given Office has whatever duties, responsibilities, and
          privileges that the Rules assign to it.

[Most of the rest of the current R.1006 is superfluous baggage.]

Protoproposal Chaos52 [rev. 7]

Evidentiary Status of Officer Reports

Be it resolved, that Rule 1768 be amended to read:

|     (a) The published Report of an Officer is presumed to be correct
|         with respect to those matters reported therein which that
|         Officer is required by law to report.

|     (b) This presumption shall be set aside only by clear and
|         convincing evidence that the Report is in error, and such
|         evidence shall only be considered if:
|       (1) a formal claim alleging the error is made within 21 days
|           of the publication of the Report in question, or
|       (2) credible evidence is presented that the Official published
|           the Report in bad faith, or in doing so relied in good
|           faith on information presented to em in bad faith.

      (c) For the purpose of this Rule, the Speaker shall be
          considered an Officer.
| 
|     (d) This Rule in no way prohibits an Officer from acknowledging
|         or correcting an error in a Report published by that
|         Officer.

I thought "Votes" might be easier for the Assessor to spot.  (If Blob
deals with mail similarly to me, he would pass over mail messages
pertaining to his job while he read new batches of mail, and then come
back to them later.  It's not the best method for dealing with
official mail, but it seems to work OK for me.

There wasn't a cunning plan to do you out of some VTs, honest :-)

Because then you could amend it to something entirely different

Ah, what a wonderful idea!  Let's have a hundred "trivial" changes
in a single proposal, so that I have a limited time to verify that they
really are trivial, rather than doing them one at a time at the more
leisurely pace of 5-10 per week.

This seems a far cry from the Steve I knew in Nomic World. There, a
Rule was adopted requiring very specific formatting for Proposals.
This was similar to the later Declarations we had here in Agora.
Writing a Rule was akin to writing a computer program. As a result,
of the forst ten or so proposals attempted under this Rule, eight
or so were thrown out for being improperly formatted.
  Now the result of this rule was to relate the influence of Players
to the time they committed since it took time to understand the
system and to painstakingly check one's proposals for proper
formatting. But Steve and I both agreed that the Rule was ludicrous,
since it made proposal-making a tedious chore rather than an
enjoyable activity. The predictable result was a decline in Proposals.
So we worked together to repeal the Rule.
  A similar situation obtains today. Getting a Proposal Adopted is a
major chore. That is inherent in the system. As it is, I am hesitant
to put the effort into Proposals that are controversial beause I
don't want to waste my effort. The effect is to make Proposals duller,
(although not too dull or no one will bother), and Voting less
valuable (since no one will care enough to vote against, you only need
a few people to get someting passed). For the life of me, I can't
see why those are desirable effects. If you want increased economic
activity, and increased politicking, you want to encourage proposals
that are controversial and might fail. Can you imagine a proposal
like Waggie's Walrus Scam in today's climate? The best way to
encourage such proposals is to make proposing less of a commitment
(supply-side economics: in this case, lowering prices encourages
people to spend more, not less). Now we could fiddle with all out
little variables, lowering the priority bar, lowering the voting
cost, tweaking the BOS, the VTCL, etc., etc. But wouldn't it be
more efficient to simply railroad those dull, uninteresting proposals
through the system? Wouldn't it be better to have three controversial
proposals among which you had to spread your two votes, rather
than three controversial and five dull proposals among which you
spent six votes? Then everyone would vote on the controversial
proposals, eliminating the hard choices you want players to make,
and the dull proposals would pass anyway, since few votes are
needed and Presence is free. Isn't this the simpler than the
alternative? I find it ironic that you trumpet against the erosion
of our traditions when you are currently proposing the most radical
revision of those traditions Agora has ever seen.

Protoproposal Chaos232 [rev. 2]

Eliminate Transfer Orders

Be it resolved, that Rule 1799 be amended to read:

      Any Order may always be amended, stayed, or vacated by the
      Player (or, in the case of Appellate Orders, Board of Appeal)
      who executed it.  Certain classes of Orders may be amended,
      stayed, or vacated in other circumstances as well, when the
|     Rules so allow. In all cases, this is done by an Order to Amend,
|     Stay, or Vacate, respectively, the original Order.

      Otherwise, an Order shall not be amended, stayed, vacated, or
      otherwise changed once executed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1637 be amended to read:

      A Will is an SLC.  The Jurisdiction of a Will is always empty.
|     Each Will belongs to exactly one entity. The Notary shall be the
|     Maintainer of all Wills.

      A Will shall specify the heirs of the entity to which it
      belongs, and how the currencies possessed by that entity and its
      other assets will be divided amongst those heirs when that
      entity is placed in Probate.  When an entity's Will is executed,
      the Executor in Probate of that entity will first execute all
      the transfers required by the Will (excepting those which e
      cannot execute or cannot execute successfully, for whatever
      reason), and will then divide the remaining residual assets as
      provided by the Will.

      A Will is created or amended by the Execution of an Application
      to Create a Will.  Such an Application must clearly identify the
      entity to which the Will is to belong, requires the Signature of
      the Executor of the entity to which the Will is to belong, and
      is Executed by submitting it to the Notary.  The effect of
      Executing such an Application is to create a Will belonging to
      that entity.  Any prior Will belonging to that entity is
      destroyed at the same time.

      A Will belonging to an Organization is not an SLC associated to
      that Organization, as defined elsewhere.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1727 be amended, by replacing the
paragraph reading:

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that, not less than seven days prior to
      Agora's Birthday, the Chancellor shall, on behalf of the Bank,
      submit delayed Transfer Orders to be executed at 00:04:30 GMT
      +1200 on Agora's Birthday to each Player for the amount of 3 VTs
      each;

with a paragraph reading

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that, as close to Agora's Birthday as
      possible, the Chancellor shall, on behalf of the Bank, execute
      transfers of 3 VTs to each Player;

and by replacing the paragraph reading:

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Chancellor shall, on behalf of
      the Bank, submit Transfer Orders for one P-note each from the
      Bank to each Player who posts to the Public Forum during Agora's
      Birthday a message recognizing Agora's Birthday; these Transfer
      Orders to be executed as soon as possible after Agora's Birthday
      ends;

with a paragraph reading

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Chancellor shall, on behalf of
      the Bank, execute transfers for one P-note each from the Bank to
      each Player who posts to the Public Forum during Agora's
      Birthday a message recognizing Agora's Birthday; these transfers
      to be executed as soon as possible after Agora's Birthday ends;

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1730 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1732 be amended to read:

      A Payment Order is only satisfied when a transfer to the payee
      of that Payment Order for the currency and amount named in that
      Payment Order is successfully executed, provided that, when that
      transfer was executed, its executor clearly indicated that that
      transfer was being executed for the purpose of satisfying the
      Payment Order in question.

      A given Payment Order can be satisfied at most once.  A vacated
      Payment Order cannot be satisfied.

      A given transfer may be used for the purpose of satisfying at
      most one Payment Order.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1735 be amended to read:

      The Chancellor is the Executor of the Bank.  As soon as possible
      after a Payment Order is executed for which the Bank is the
      payor, the Chancellor shall either (as the Bank's Executor)
      satisfy the Payment Order, or dispute it by making a COE or CFJ.
      However, the Chancellor need not do so if another Player makes
      such a COE or CFJ first.

      If the Chancellor executes a transfer from the Bank for any
      reason other than to satisfy a Payment Order (except when
      specifically required by the Rules to execute a transfer), e
      commits the Class A Crime of Misappropriation, and upon
      conviction of this Crime shall be removed from Office.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1817 be amended to read:

      A Recordkeepor is required to record all valid transfers
      executed by the Executor of the owner of the units of Currency
      to be transferred (or, with respect to any entity which lacks an
      Executor, by any other person empowered by the Rules to execute
      transfers on the behalf of such entities), except for those
      transfers which would result in an entity possessing a negative
      quantity of Currency. Transfers shall be noted on the
      Recordkeepor's records in the order in which they are received
      by the Recordkeepor.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1818 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1739 be amended, by replacing the
paragraph reading

      Units of Currency are assigned to an entity by requiring a
      Transfer Order for those Units of Currency from the entity in
      Probate to that Entity.

with one reading

      Units of Currency are assigned to an entity by requiring the
      execution of a transfer of those Units of Currency from the
      entity in Probate to that Entity.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1820 be amended to read:

      Each Recordkeepor shall maintain a record of all transfers
      executed which specify the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor, for at least four weeks after their execution.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1823 be amended to read:

      If a Player is required to execute two or more Payment Orders,
      all of which name the same Payor, Payee, and Currency, that
      Player may elect to instead execute one Payment Order naming
      that Payor, Payee and Currency, and for an amount equal to the
      sum of all such Payment Orders required.  Doing so satisfies by
      substitution the requirement to execute all such Payment Orders.

      This Rule may not be applied with respect to any Payment Order
      required consequent to the vacation or stay of another Payment
      Order.

      Payment Orders to be executed for the purpose of paying for
      Voting upon Proposals may not be combined by this Rule with
      Payment Orders executed for any other purpose.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1757 be amended to read:

      (a) The Trustee of an entity in Probate is empowered to execute
          on behalf of that entity whatever transfers are necessary to
          implement eir Plan for the disposition of that entity's
|         Estate, as if e were that entity's Executor. The Trustee may
|         also execute and vacate Payment Orders when necessary to
          implement the Plan for the disposition of the Estate.

      (b) The Trustee may exercise the above powers only when
          implementing a Plan for the disposition of the Estate of the
          entity in Probate of which e is the Trustee.

      (c) The Trustee of an entity in Probate ceases to be Trustee
          when:
        (1) e announces in the Public Forum that e resigns as Trustee;
        (2) e ceases to be a Player;
        (3) the entity of which e is Trustee ceases to be in Probate;
            or
        (4) the Notary announces that e has been removed as Trustee.

      (d) An entity in Probate ceases to be in Probate when its
          Trustee announces the completion of the implementation of a
          Plan for the disposition of the Estate of that entity.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1596 be amended to read:

      A Payment Order is an Order requiring an entity (the payor) to
      execute a transfer transferring units of a Currency from itself
      to some other entity (the payee).  A Payment Order specifies
      exactly one source entity, exactly one destination entity,
      exactly one Currency, and a number of units of that Currency
      which is a positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1598 be amended to read:

      (a) A transfer is valid if:
        (1) the entity executing it is the Executor of the entity from
            which the transfer is to be made, or if that entity has no
            Executor, such other Player as is authorized to execute
            transfers on behalf of that entity;
        (2) the transfer is denominated in exactly one Currency;
        (3) the amount transferred is a positive multiple of that
            Currency's MUQ;
        (4) the entity from which the transfer is to be made, prior to
            that transfer, possesses at least that many units of that
            Currency; and
        (5) if the transfer purports to be executed to satisfy a
            particular Payment, that Payment Order exists and is
            capable of being satisfied by that transfer.

|     (c) A transfer is executed by submitting a Transfer Notice to
          the Recordkeepor of the Currency in which it is denominated;
          this Notice shall set forth:
        (1) the entity from which the transfer is being made;
        (2) the entity to which the transfer is being made;
        (3) the Currency involved;
        (4) the number of units of Currency being transferred; and
        (5) the purpose of the transfer, if specification of the
            purpose of the transfer is necessary to meet with the
            requirements of another Rule.

I find this proto interesting, and if you remind me when the time comes,
I'll spend some P-Notes on it. However, the currencies we currently [ha!]
have should expire no less than 2 months from the passage. Let's not
completely destroy one's holdings, after all, how fast can you spend
currencies?

Divided by 0.5? Is that a typo? Either multiplied by 2 or divided by 2
(depending on your intention).

Down with Playerism!

Be it resolved, that Rule 833 be amended to read:

      As soon as possible after the beginning of the Nomic Week, the

      submitted an Interested Proposal which was adopted during the
      previous Week.

Okay, you've caught me out. I can't actually name much (although I do
think you are misrepresenting Scott's proposals), but then that sort of
repair has never been my concern. One example I can name however is the
problem with being able to satisfy payment orders by issuing appropriate
TOs, even if you don't have sufficient funds. That bug has been around
for ages, but nobody has ever got around to fixing it.

Making such a proposal would not prove anything. Partly that is because
it would not be a valid test - by being put forward as a test case, it 
would automatically bias the outcome. But even if we could disassociate
it from the discussion, it would only be another example of the kind of
thing I object to. My point is that it costs too much to make trivial
fixes, and that those costs are preventing those fixes from being made.
Costs are not just economic - compiling a spring cleaning proposal
like you suggest costs more in time and effort, both for the compiler
and for the voters (and, as Chuck says, for the Rulekeepor).

It is also bad for the game, as the problems remain unfixed for much 
longer, until a "critical mass" of fixes can be collected. After a while
we tend to forget that the bugs are there, which only makes adopting 
fixes even more troublesome. I'd much prefer that we fix problems as
they arise.

I'm kind of the wrong person to be arguing this anyway. I wouldn't be
proposing the fixes even if Summary Adoption was functioning. It's not
my thing. Ask the people who habitually do that sort of thing. Or, if 
you think it is so interesting, you check the ruleset and propose it 
yourself. If you're not willing to do this, don't stand in the way of
the people who are trying to repair things.

Michael,

I agree with (Chuck, I think) that as they stand, Expiring Currencies 
would involve too much paperwork. And I'm not so keen on the random 
distribution system either. Otherwise I like the idea.
