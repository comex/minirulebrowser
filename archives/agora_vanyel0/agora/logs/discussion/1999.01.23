I would like to remind anyone interested that my Distributor archive from
mid February to early August 1994 is still available at
<ftp://ftp.nvg.ntnu.no/pub/nomic/digests>.

In fact, for this period most official messages were not sent to the yoyo
listserv, but instead to the Distributor (me), who had a small elm filter
script to pass it on to the Players.  However, I have included also
official messages that were sent to the yoyo listserv, as well as selected
messages that I found interesting.

Garth Rose.  Incidentally, while he has not been in Agora for several
years, he just this October came back to the Fantasy Rules Committee.

What about resurrecting the Erg Currency from the failed Plots, for a
simplified version of the latter? Players might get Salaries paid in Ergs,
and could exchange these for VTs or P-Notes (possibly also Indulgences);
however each Player had to choose one Currency which e could get with
Ergs.  I am not sure if Ergs themselves should be transferable between
Players or not.

Ørjan.

I think noone denies that the original mail with the proposal did not
reach any subscriber of the PF lists, and it didn'tsh ow up on the

that for this reason the first attempt to submit the proposal failed.

This sounds rather like my old "Jobs & Wages" proto, which sparked
the whole Plots thing. I'm not so keen on the idea anymore. I like the
way our current system pays of VTs and P-Notes on completely 
independent grounds. I would be reluctant to set in place a system 
that made an arbitrary equivalence in value between the two.
