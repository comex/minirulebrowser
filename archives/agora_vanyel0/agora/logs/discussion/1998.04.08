I don't think that's what I was suggesting. Why not think that R1802,
quite consistently, deprives a vacated TO from having any of its past
effects?

Blush.  It wasn't an official retraction (it wasn't to the Public
Forum): rather a statement of intent.  Given Bethmo's point about the
correct reading of the rule in question, I now retract the statement
of intent though. :-)

Reasons why I think you should vote for me in the Election to the
Clerk of the Courts:

*  I am experienced in the position specifically (having served as
   CotC for the administration of CFJs 871-938, from May 1996 until
   August 1997), and experienced in the game in general.

*  I believe I can do a good job.

*  I am not a self-confessed Loose Cannon :-)

Then let me elucidate, using the creation of a new Power 1 Rule as an example
and assuming we have 300 existing Rules.  Under the "direct conflict"
interpretation, one would have to make, at most, 300 checks to see if there is
a conflict with another Rule in determining the new Rule's effects, an order N
(polynomial) process, for the mathematically minded.  Under the "in the
presence of other Rules" interpretation, one would have to look at all possible
subsets of the 300 Rules to make an exhaustive search for potential conflicts. 
There are 2^300 such subsets, making it an order 2^N (exponential) process.

Now, of course, most such combinations are inconsequential and we don't even
consider them in determining a new Rule's effects (otherwise we would never
have time to implement any Rules 8).  But the fact that there are so many of
them means there is a small but significant chance that some combination of
Rules conflict in a way that no one has yet noticed.  Look how long it took for
us to notice this particular conflict with the Proposal and Queue rules.

You may not have been suggeting it, but the Rules would force that
interpretation.  One of the past effects of a TO is the transfer of Currency
from one "account" to another.  R1818 requires us to retain that effect beyond
the vacation of the TO in the case where the original payee can't cover the
reverse transfer, and even in the case where it *can* be covered, 1818 causes a
reversing transfer rather than deeming that the original transfer never took
place.  So the actual transfer is an effect of the TO of which it can never be
deprived.

After reviewing the Rules about proposals and
studying the recent decisions posted for CFJ 1089,
I find nothing in Michael's execellent arguments
for eir original CFJ 1090 decision with which I
disagree or to which I have anything to add.  I
would be interested to see the discussion that
Steve mentioned regarding this CFJ, but if I do
not see a convincing refutation of Michael's
original argument, I intend to sustain eir
judgement.

Speak for yourself.  I recognized it almost immediately.  Just because
I recognize a conflict between two Rules (or a loophole) doesn't mean
I immediately jump up and report it.  That's not necessarily in my
best interest.

I just want to thank the Justices for CFJ 1089. I am now satisfied
that the issue has been given due deliberation, and will accept their
ruling.

So what are the consequences of this? The Threats did not win, so our
Champions Awards shall have to be cancelled, I suppose. A good thing 
that I didn't spend it all at once.

I suppose this also means that Swann's proposal is still in the Queue.
With quite high priority too. A pity we can't remove it - it would 
just be embarrassing to have it redistributed now.

Although the decision on CFJ 1090 has not yet been delivered, I think
that is now a formality. I would ask that whomever is responsible for
issuing Payment Orders reversing the Champion's Rewards of myself,
Swann, General Chaos, eljefe and Blob please do so before the end of
the Voting Period of Tabula Rasa, to give us time to satisfy them
before our VTs are destroyed (should Tabula Rasa pass).

Actually, the discussion I mentioned concerned CFJ 1089,
as appears as my Appellate decision in the Appeal of that
CFJ.

I'm moving to a new house tomorrow morning, but the #$@*^@! phone
company is not connecting our phone until April 21, Tuesday week.
They can get away with this outrageous behaviour because the
Easter public holiday means that they are still connecting our
phone within '7 working days' of our moving into the place.

The upshot is that I will be without a phone for 12 days starting
tomorrow, and therefore unable to log in from home during that period.
I may be able to log in from work occasionally.

I'm seeking a Delegate to look after the Assessorship during this
period. Any volunteers?
