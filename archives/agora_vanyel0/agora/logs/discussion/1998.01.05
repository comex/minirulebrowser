What problems?  If a Group satisfies the condition, the Vizier gets the Win
and the Group itself loses its Plots.

Because the names make sense.  I think I'll change Ranches back to Houses,
with the old effects.  And until P-Notes are more useful than they are
right now, I see little problem with Ranches not having anything detract
from their Production.

I think that got accidentally omitted in the Plots/Mules-as-Currency
revisions.  I'm going to add it back in.

I'm going to work on something like that.

Thanx (in advance) for the rules, that will ensure that I have the
current
ruleset.I'm not 'keeping track of' the rules but putting them into a
more
easily accessible (for me anyway) format. I find it a lot easier to
search
for a keyword or 2 (like I did yesterday for 'crime' & 'infraction') and
browse the found set, than to flick back and forward through an unwieldy
'document' (hard or softcopy).

I'm 1/3 through them already.

Is there a simple explanation as to why the Virus was repealed ?
Was it the repeal-o-matic rule (that I can't find in my ruleset) ?

Hopefully you'll finish them before they've all been amended.  Bwa ha

The Virus and the Frankenstein Monster were both repealed after the
Assessor (me) resigned eir Office in protest over the gross
instability and uncertainty, especially pertaining to eir Office, that
the FM created.  Several Players (apparently a majority) felt that we
don't need a shotgun blowing out sections of the Ruleset; we're quite
capable of creating sufficient chaos without it.

Except to prevent the owner from erecting something on it emself.  At least
give the plot owner the right to eject.

The trouble is, the Group _doesn't_ lose its plots, and an indeterminate
number of wins is generated.  The problem is with the second paragraph,
which says:

...but which says nothing about what happens when a Group or Contest wins.

Sounds problematic, as the very first Plot distributed will give its owner
a Win, whence he immediately loses ownership.  This needs fixing.

Ah, good point.  Still, I think I prefer not requiring consent and
permitting ejection to requiring consent.

Another problem I seem to detect: it will be impossible for anyone
(other than the Bank) to possess Plots for more than an instant.
Originally, the Bank owns all Plots.  Suppose that one of those Plots
ceases to be owned by the Bank.  Then, at that moment, all of the
Plots save one will be owned by the Bank, and the owner of that one
Plot will be the only entity other than the Bank to own Plots.  The
Executor of that entity will thus Win, and the Plot will revert to the
Bank.

Obviously, this is a problem. :)

I haven't been keeping tabs on the development of the Plots proto.
Can those responsible for it assure the public that it will not
perpetuate the inflationary regime which the repeal of R1684 seeks
to alleviate?

Personally, I'd like to see VT sources kept to an absolute minimum
until some semblance of scarcity has returned. Otherwise, I'll
be have to propose RGB III - which I'd rather not do.

Well, that's how I use my ruleset file. I keep it active in one window
and do searches on the entire document. Easy in unix. I can't send you
the Ruleset yet, though, because I've mislaid your address.

In one word: politics. Michael announced he was bored with it and
proposed to repeal it, and then Scott announced - quite unjustifiably
in my opinion - that the Virus was making life difficult for the
Assessor, tarring the Virus with same brush as the Frankenstein
Monster. A bunch of other Players jumped on the bandwagon and - poof!
- no Virus.

I haven't gotten around to reading the Omnibus Reform Act yet, but
alarm bells are ringing for me already. When I wrote that sentence
yesterday, I didn't have time to include an analysis of what the
consequences would be of prgmatizing the concept of authority. I
think they would be significant. At the very least we should have to
introduce stiff penalties for executing POs (or TOs) without proper
authority. And even if we did this, we should think carefully about
whether this is the direction we want the game to take. Although 
admittedly it does seem to be heading that way already.

I think this should have been protoed so that it could be discussed.
It's not clear to me for instance whether this Proposal is supposed to
be neutral with respect to the various theories of player/rule agency
that are floating around the place, and among which your position is
a particularly radical one.

As I understand your position, you hold that the Rules never act,
only Players do. By your lights, then, the above Proposal, if adopted,
should have the effect of completely banning retroactive effects of
any kind (or at least, those which are the results of Rules with
lower precedence than 'No Retroactivity' will have if it is created).
Other players, however, are likely to take the view that the Rules do
have some kind of agency and that the above Proposal places no
restrictions on what such Rules may do.

It's not my purpose here to say which of the various theories of 
player/rule agency, if any, are to be preferred. I'm only saying
that given that disagreement exists on the subject, it seems to
me that we cannot be very sure of how the proposed Rule is likely to
be interpreted, and hence what its effects will be. And I'm wary of
creating a Power 3 Rule whose effects are that unclear.

I never said that the Virus was making my life difficult.  I stated
that the FM was making my duties impossible, and generally vented ire
at all random rule change generators.

The Virus itself was not too problematic.  But, as Michael stated, we
don't need a shotgun blowing holes in the Ruleset when we're more than
capable of creating enough trouble for ourselves on our own.

The Plots proto as it stands is inflationary, although not necessarily
as badly as the current system.  At least, the system is not closed,
and the maintenance of a steady state depends on legislatively fine
tuning the system parameters to reflect Player spending habits, just
as in the present system.  A steady state will not naturally evolve
under this proto.

Except that no-one ever really succeeded in demonstrating that the
Virus was acting by 'blowing holes in the Ruleset'. This metaphor
suggests a violence and irreparability totally at odds with the neat,
surgical and self-repairing way that the Virus actually operated.  As
you yourself admit, the Virus was 'not too problematic'. Its repeal
is therefore to be explained as a political or public relations
victory for you and Michael, in that you succeeded in painting a
picture of the Virus as a shotgun rather than a scalpel, and not by
reference to anything actually wrong with the Virus itself - a
classic example-in-miniature of the political power of successfully
manipulating public perceptions.

I've finally gotten around to reading this. I'd say it may have
potential. At any rate, I'm not opposed to it. I have a few very
minor comments, and some questions.  

I've just proposed to repeal R1684; if that passes, you can remove
that provision. Secondly, your proposed amendment to R1016 does not
take into account the amendment just proposed by G. Chaos regarding
the use of 'Active' and 'Inactive' as synonyms for 'Off Hold' and
'On Hold' respectively.

Questions: 

1. How does one obtain Ergs initially?
2. If a Player decided to try to maximize their VT income from
   Structures, how many VTs could they obtain, approximately, in
   this fashion?

The Omnibus Reform Act states that any Order executed in the manner
appropriate for its class (that is, Judicial, Appellate,
Administrative, or Private) is valid until judicially proven
otherwise, but then defines the requirements of such proof.  The
willful execution of invalid Orders is a Class B Crime.

It appears that I still need to add an invalidity defense to the
Contempt charge.  It might also be a good idea to extend the automatic
stay of Orders alleged to be invalid to such allegations made not only
inthe Statement of the CFJ, but also in the Response, if any.  That
is, assuming that I get around to adding Responses. :)

      All Orders executed in the manner prescribed by the Rules for
      their class and type are presumed valid and enforceable until
      proven otherwise by CFJ.  However, in order to be proven valid
      by CFJ, the Rules must permit the Player who executed the Order
      in question to execute such an Order, that the execution of the
      Order must have been required by or permitted in the
      circumstances which existed at the time it was executed, and
      that the Order has not been rendered invalid by the operation of
      any other Rule.  Furthermore, no Order may act to prevent or
      hinder its own appeal in any way, and any portion of an Order
      which has this effect is void and without force.

BUS: Report of Win

You know, I hate to say this, but I'm not so sure this is true.  The Rule does
not specify that no FOR votes were counted for the Proposal, only that no votes
FOR it were received.  Even though the vote was later retracted, there was a
time when it *did* receive a vote FOR.  Similar reasoning for this as that of
Steve's argument for Morendil's Crime CFJ.  What do others think?

I meant to proto it, but my proto management system decided to propose
it instead (oops).  You may consider this to be an unusual form of
protoproposing.
