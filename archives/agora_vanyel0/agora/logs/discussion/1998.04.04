Since players always vote on the text presented to them (rather than the
text send to the Promotor, if the two are different) this isn't really a
worry -- under the current Rules, whichever way this CFJ is judged, there
is no way that Players can Vote on a Proposal whose actual text they don't
know.

Damn. Accident.

H. Promotor, I hereby remove my Proposal "Electees" from the Queue.

I advocate a monthly property tax with a rather high rate - say, 25% 
to 50%. This would cause hoarding to be an unattractive option, and 
would probably make voting on proposals distributed on the 20th be 
rather interesting. :-)

It is, of course, a decoy, to distract you from the REAL illuminati.
