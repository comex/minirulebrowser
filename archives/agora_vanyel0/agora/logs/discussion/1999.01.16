Yikes! That's *very* high - it will bring into circulation more than 20
VTs a *week* for the next month. The last non-zero value the BOs had
was, I think, 0.4 VTs.

This is another problem with setting the BOS only every month. The
control is too coarse grained. We're now stuck with this value until
February.

To be completely accurate, however, you should mention at this point
that since Deadryl Lacos would be a New Player upon joining, he would be
exempted from the Duty to Propose for 2 months, while Grace Period
lasts. See R1865.

Oops, ignore that. I didn't realize that the BOS was being set to 1 VT
per month.

I should probably add that I have not really given Ørjan the opportunity
to deliver such a ruling, useful though it would be. CFJ 1112 is not
really about the technical meaning of "receipt of a message in the PF",
but about the technical meaning of "submit a Proposal".

But of course this provision in no way implies that a message which is
not delivered to any Player (other than the sender), due to technical
problems with its delivery, can be considered to have been delivered to
to PF.

This might seem a bit weird, but I will have to write a proposal 
sometime.  So I might as well do something interesting…  Reading over 
the mail from the public forums, the talk about economics seemed to have 
a point.  So I thought I might try to commodities.

Firstly there is a need for units other than currencies that can be 
owned and traded with.  I am not sure just how this is going to go down 
in the community but here goes.   I know that a lot of this is based on 
the currency rules, but there are differences and I think we need 
commodities which are separate from currencies.  The trading section is 
a bit iffy but I think it should work fine with a few improvements.   
Also I am not sure if this should just be one rule or several.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Protoposal  - Commodities

Create a rule with the following text.



Definition of a Commodity

      There are certain entities, which are Commodities.  An entity is a 
Commodity if and only if it has been made such by the Rules, and if and 
only if it complies with all the requirements in the Rules pertaining to 
Commodities.

      Neither Commodities nor units of  a Commodity shall be created or 
destroyed except as specified by the Rules.



Names of Commodities

      Each Commodity shall have a name, which must be distinct from the 
name of every other Commodity.

      Any attempt to create a Commodity with the same name as an already 
existing Commodity fails.



The Storemaster

      There shall exist the Office of Storemaster.

      The Storemaster shall retain a schedule, listing every Commodity 
which exists, detailing for each Commodity, the Name, the amount owned 
by each player or group, and the amount which is unclaimed. The 
Storemaster shall post this schedule to a Public Forum at least once in 
each week.



Trading of commodities

      Commodities may be traded between players and/or groups.  To do 
this one party, know as the Seller, writes to a public forum making a 
Trading Proposal.  The Seller’s Trading Proposal must state that it is a 
Trading Proposal, also it must state what commodities the seller wishes 
to trade, and what Commodities he wishes to receive for them.  The 
seller may, or may not choose to list entities he is willing to trade 
with.  If e does so then only the entities listed may accept the Trading 
Proposal.

      For the trade to commence an entity, know as the Buyer, must 
accept the trading Proposal.  For a buyer to be able to accept the 
trading proposal e must have whatever the Seller wishes for his 
commodities, as stated in the trading proposal.  If the Seller lists the 
entities e wishes to trade with in the trading proposal only entities 
from that list can be the Buyer for the given trading proposal.

      The Buyer must write to the public forum stating that he wishes to 
trade, naming the person and the commodities from the trading proposal.  
If e does this and there are no other rules which would disallow the 
trade, then the trade commences, and the ownership of the named 
commodities are changed, to comply to the trading proposal.

      The first eligible Buyer, who writes to the public forum accepting 
a trading proposal, is the only person who may accept the trading 
proposal.  After a trading proposal has been accepted and the trade 
commenced, no other Buyer may accept it.

      For the above text currencies may be traded with as if they where 
commodities, unless by doing so an other rule would broken.

      Unless otherwise stated in other rules concerning a commodity, all 
commodities can only be traded with in integer multiples.
 


Ownership of Commodities

      Any person or group may own commodities.  Only positive integer 
quantities of a commodity may ever be owned.

      If a quantity of a commodity is not owned by any person or group, 
it is unclaimed.  Any Person or group can claim a quantity of an 
unclaimed commodity by writing to a public forum stating the quantity  
of which commodity it is they wish to own.  As soon as such a claim is 
posted the quantity of the commodity stated is owned by the person or 
group who claimed it.

      Similarly any player or group may disown any quantity of a 
commodity by writing to a public forum stating that e is doing so.  As 
soon as e does this the stated quantity of the commodity is no longer 
owned by the player or group and becomes unclaimed.

Indeed.  It does occur to me that there is a problem, in that several
offices stipulate that they bear a weekly salary while the general
salary rules stipulate that salaries be paid monthly.  Anyone want to
take a stab at resolving this apparent conflict?

But the meaning of "submit a Proposal" is intricately tied to the
meaning of "deliver a collection of text to the Public Forum".

However, the Promotor (R.1607), Assessor (R.1449), Clerk of the Courts
(R.889), Registrar (R.559), Rulekeepor (R.1051), and Herald (R.1377)
all receive weekly salaries.  I invite comment on how these provisions 
shall be construed in connection with Rule 1007.

I must say that whoever tried to convert us to monthly salaries did a
very sloppy job of it.

Very good - let's see some scarcity here. A Voting tariff of o.1 VTs
would hardly justify the hassle of issuing, satisfying and recording

I should think that it would be an important part of my ruling to find out
what the Statement actually means.
