Why is there a hyphen instead of a 'u' in 'subscribed'? Is this a sacred, 
unwriteable name, like 'G-d'?

This is an idea I would consider, given that PC reform actually made things
_less_ pragmatic than before.

I have some comments on parts of the Proto:

1.)  Convertibility

I dislike the notion of "convertibility" and of "universal currency". As
Oerjan has noted, a prerequisite for an interesting trading game may be the
inconvertibility of things, forcing players to barter with each other

"Like for Like" conversions, like 10 deci-VTs for 1 VT, can be encoded in a
Rule as a definition.  ("Deci-VT's are a Class of Objects.  A Voting Token
is defined to be 10 deci-VTs.")  In fact, this will skip the conversion
step and avoid arguments like:

    - "I hereby cast one vote FOR the proposal."
    = "That vote was illegal as you didn't have sufficient funds."
    - "Yes, I did.  I had 10 deci-VTs."
    = "So?  Votes may only be cast by spending VTs, not by some other
currency."


2.)  When the Recordkeepor is not a Player

>     If the designated Recordkeepor of a Class of Objects ceases to be a
>     Player, the Speaker shall fulfill that responsibility until a new
>     Recordkeepor is selected according to whatever procedure
>     applies.  If there is no procedure defined for selecting a new
>     Recordkeepor, then all Objects within that Class are destroyed and
>     that Class of Object ceases to exist.  It is the Speaker's duty
>     to report this change to eimself as Recordkeepor.

I'd prefer to get rid of this condition, which adds nothing and simply
causes trouble and CFJs whenever it is actually invoked.  Instead write:

      If the designated Recordkeepor of a Class of Objects ceases to be
      a Player, and other Rules do not define a procedure for selecting
      a new Recordkeepor, the Speaker shall as soon as possible designate
      a willing player as the new Recordkeepor for that Class of Objects.

      Until a new Recordkeepor is designated, the Speaker shall fulfill
      that responsibility.


3.) Transferring Objects

>     When an Object is Transferred it ceases to be owned by one entity,
>     and simultaneously becomes owned by another entity.
>
>     An Object is Legally Transferred when the Player designated by the
>     Rules to report the Transfer, reports the Transfer, the original
>     owner of the Object, and the new owner of the Object, to that
>     Object's Recordkeepor.  At this point the transfer is part of the
>     Legal State of that Object.
>
>     An Object is Actually Transferred when the Recordkeepor for that
>     Object records the change in ownership for that Object.  At this
>     point the change becomes part of the Actual State of that Object.


This is a source of confusion for me.  Another rule says that the "owner"
of an object can initiate a transfer to another entity (or something).  My
question is, does this mean the "legal owner" or the "actual owner"?  (That
is, the owner in the "legal state" or the owner in the "actual state"?)

If only the actual owner can make the transfer, then the new owner can't
use the object until the recordkeepor does eir job.  This is an
inconvenience much like the old days when players had to wait for the
Vizier to convert their Reform Coins to Points (or Marks?) before they
could use them to buy things.  Further, it leaves the old owner (who is
still "actual owner") in a position to initiate a transfer of the same
object again!

On the other hand, if the legal owner is permitted to make a transfer, then
we have indeterminacy creeping in, since each transaction may depend on the
eventually decided legal validity of earlier transactions.


4.) Executors in Probate

>      ii) Then, as soon as possible thereafter, the Executor in Probate
>          must report all Transfers of Transferable Objects possessed by

Careful here.  There is a chance that the transfers might never be able to
be made, (for example: A will that transfers 1,000,000,000 VTs to The
Threat).  The executor would be stuck in this step forever.


5.) The Bank

>     There shall exist a Nomic Entity called the Bank.  The Bank is
>     permitted to possess any Object.  This Rule takes prcidence over
>     any Rule that would forbid the Bank from owning an object.
>
>{Comment: No such thing as mint authority.}

And of course, if we really don't want another lengthy discussion of atomic
vs. sequential vs. simultaneous implementation, and destruction of VTs,
you'll need to be very careful about ensuring continuity of VTs in the
actual Proposal.


6.)  Debt

>    iii) If neither i) or ii) hold, e shall Create, in the possession of
>         the entity, (N) Blots and (N) of the Objects being Transferred
>         or Destroyed. (Where M is the difference between the number of

>         Objects being Transferred or Destroyed.)

This means that someone could vote without having VTs, as long as e was
willing to incur Blots.  Do we want this?


These are the major things I noticed at first.  Please keep working on this!

Have these Players remembered to notify the Registrar of their change of

Majordomo will intercept messages that contain "s-bscribe" in them.
Steve has incorrectly imputed that it will also intercept those that
contain "subscribed" as well.

Amendments to the Rules do not modify the Game State, at least not
directly (except as far as the Rules are part of the Game State).
They do, however, modify Rules.  The Amendment Number merely counts
the number of modifications made to a given Rule.  I see a substantial
conceptual difference that, unfortunately, I cannot elucidate, at
least not in a manner you appear to find satisfactory.

I don't accept that the Statement of a CFJ should be considered
relevant to the Rules merely because it is the Statement of a CFJ.
Such a construction necessarily denies statutory meaning, and we
should try to eschew such constructions unless no other reasonable
construction exists.

Precisely.  And, suppose further that, 5 minutes later, we elected to

I was going to say that I was the only one on the Internet, but an
Altavista web search on oerjan/orjan/ørjan johansen gives a few:

Me, 6 hits. 

Another guy in Trondheim at "Hogskolen i Sor-Trondelag", 3 hits.
(Hm, maybe that is the guy who should have had all those housebuilding

Someone who got in second in a climbing competition and might or might not

I am sure I was the first one, though. :-)

No, it's been assigned to me as CFJ 1047. 

Any suggestions as to how I should judge?

Procedure, more or less:
1) Save the Full Logical Ruleset to a file. Start vi(m).
2) Grep (actually, v/re/d) for lines mentioning passed Proposals, like
"Mutated from MI=Unanimity to MI=3 by Proposal 1483, Mar. 15 1995"
3) Strip down the lines to just Proposal number and month.
4) Sort by Proposal number.
5) Notice that even with just months shown, the list is obviously not
completely chronological. Throw away enough lines to get apparent
consistency.
6) Pick the first proposal listed for each month.
7) Subtract (using, from within vim, a devious combination of paste, s//,
and bc) the numbers for neighboring months, producing the table shown.

The exclamation mark is just because it spans 2 months - there were no
Proposals mentioned in the FLR for June 1994.

My presumption is that there is some kind of intrinsic productivity in the
Game, and that when you look at a sufficiently large number of weeks, the
Proposals should be distributed more or less evenly over them.

(Argh, pine locked up and I could only recover the above part of my
message. :-(
Rest rewritten.)

I wanted my Judgement to give a long term picture and so it didn't seem
appropriate to base the calculations on just a few months. By basing them
on the entire history of Agora I hoped to find the "intrinsic
productivity" of the Game, as above.

However, I have later realized that there are certain factors that could
imply that there are now, and will be in the future, fewer Proposals than
at the start of the game:

1) Multiple rule changes in a Proposal
2) Disincentives to large numbers of Proposals (this is the one factor
that I attempted to consider in my judgement, by removing Chromatic
Repeals.)
3) A larger number of Proposals initially due to the need of building up
"basic services."

Therefore, it might be reasonable to base the calculations on a somewhat
shorter period, but I think one year is too short.

Consider instead the 2 years from August 1995 - August 1997:

44 + 36 + 55 + 55 + 44 + 44 + 54 + 63 + 25 + 30 + 13 + 18 + 10 + 28 + 53 +
34 + 11 + 21 + 26 + 20.5 + 15 + 30 + 30 + 16

= 775.5

or 775.5/(2*52)

= 7.4567 Proposals per week.

This should then give an average Voting stipend of 4.6042 VT per week,
or a total of 92.1 VT.

Deciding what Proposals to Vote on and how does require some work, of
course, but if we were to base the decision entirely on comparison of
workload we would be forced to pay most Officers _more_ than their Voting
stipend in salary, rather than the mere half I was suggesting.

Yes, it is fortunate that your views, where disagreeing with mine,
actually bolsters the conclusion further.

The basic question is whether a phrase like "I transfer 2 VTs" can count
as two Transfer Orders when it is clear that it was intended as such. 

I for one would have no problem with your judging this TRUE on the basis
of Rule 754. 

If you don't agree, I suppose you could rule for dismissal, as the work
necessary to gather enough evidence to support a FALSE Judgement, given
that the CFJ was only intended to decide this one denial, is unreasonable. 
I believe the "reasonable" phrasing of Rule 1565 can be used as a license
to consider the intent of the original Caller, and the general interest of
the question. Remember also the stronger requirements for a TRUE Judgement
in Rule 1575. 

Greetings,
Ørjan.

What absurdity?

It's not my list, it is Richard Kennaway's list. My homepage proper is
rather undeveloped. I don't even have my own constructed language to
display... 

I did mention Val$ar (and FRC Newspeak) in a joint post to the Conlang and
FRC lists on 1 Mar 1996, but the only person to comment was Vanyel, who
was just surprised that we were subscribed to the same lists :-) 

Incidentally, Vanyel seems to be more active on Conlang than Agora and FRC
nowadays.

Actually, everyone and their grandmother seems to be more active elsewhere
than on FRC nowadays. The word moribund is lurking in the background. Soon
Agora might be the oldest nomic-like game alive. :-(

The theme of the current Round (now closed to newcomers) is "How to keep a
round alive." It doesn't seem to be working. 

I guess we are not advertising enough - one recently removed ad in the
Yellow Pages probably did at one time lead many Agora Players into FRC,
but now even those are old worn-out hats. Where can we find fresh blood
with too much time on their hands? 

Greetings,
Ørjan.

One problem with the format previously was the lack of restrictions on
the number or frequency of posts. By the time I came up with an
interesting Rule, there would already be half a dozen new Rules that would
make mine obsolete. Repeat ad nauseam. I don't know if that is still a
problem.

But, given the atomic view, isn't there only one modification
to 1551 enacted by Proposal 3445?  "Amendment," as far as I
can tell, is not clearly defined anywhere in the Rules.  And
if you argue that Game Custom defines 3445 as making 2, and
not 1, amendments to 1551, doesn't that in itself support the
sequential view?

I agree with that, but that's not my point.  Consider the
following hypothetical CFJs:

CFJ 2000: The proper judgement of CFJ 1 is TRUE.
CFJ 2001: The proper judgement of CFJ 2001 is TRUE.
CFJ 2002: This statement is TRUE.

Which of these are relevant to the Rules?  Why or why not?

Ah, I hadn't realized I only had to worry about the exact string.

Actually, yes, in a way. Every time a message, like yours above, with
the string 's-bscribe', only spelt without the hyphen, appears in a
message, majordomo@gecko interprets it as an attempt to s-bscribe,
only one it cannot understand, and bounces it to me as the list
administrator.
