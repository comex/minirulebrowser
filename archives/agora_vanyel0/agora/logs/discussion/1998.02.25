Yay! _This_ is what I proposed the Election rules for. I've waited a
long time for some interesting elections to result. This is, as far as
I can recall, our first set of elections with more than two popular 
candidates for an Office. 

I understand Michael's concern, but I would oppose changing to a 
preferential system. I would like to explore the strategic aspects of
the current system for a little longer. And the preferential system 
is dull, anyway.

Then again, here's a curious idea which just popped into my head, inspired
by Michael's "retraction". What if candidates were able to drop out of
the race, during the election, and transfer all their votes to another?
That could be a very interesting strategic device... Hsm.

Absolutely not.  As Macross has already said, this will tend to
ensconce the wealthy in positions of power and the poor will have
precious little recourse.  What, for example, would be the point of
rebelling if you're not going to be able to afford to vote for your
candidates of choice?

Steve asked:

>Under what circumstances is a Judge held to be delinquent? The term
>is not used in any other Rules in the Ruleset.


The definition of "Delinquent" was lost in a clash of proposals: General
Chaos' "Persistent Judges" and my "Late Judgements", which both passed.

>Also, am I right in thinking that the CotC more or less has the
>power to decide whether a late Judge  cops a 1 VT penalty or a 3
>Blot penalty, by deciding whether or not to wait for a late Judge's
>Judgement before reporting the Infraction of Judging Late?

Right.  A CFJ ought to be judged on time.  However, if it's a bit late, and
has either been delivered or is reasonably expected soon, then Rule 408
saves time and effort over the old way, which required a new judge.

But the CotC has wide discretion on how long to wait: up to a week after
the original due date.  After that it cannot be accepted and must be
reassigned.

This gives us two possible commonsense interpretations of "delinquent":
either 7 or 14 days after assignment.  Rather than CFJ on which, I think
I'll proto a legislative remedy.

Thanks for this listing! I am relieved to see that others make small
mistakes in these tallies, too: Scott voted for Steve as wizard, so
this election is tied between the Order and the Threat. 

In fact, the only election which is not an equal race between these
groups is that for scorekeepor (where Blob voted for a non-Threat
candidate).

Speaking as ambassador, I'd rather not see this for referenda on IN
proposals. Even now, with free voting, we don't get too many votes on
these, and introducing a price for them might cripple our ability to
participate in IN play.

Well, we'll see. But note that as soon as bribery gets involved, the
Threat can win easily, because you are much richer than the members of
the Order. So I think _if_ the undecided voters vote for the Order's

Threat officers.

With elJefe's votes, only Scorekeepor and Notary are currently tied;
all the other offices have the Threat candidate in the lead.

Further, the poor will little or no ability to change the Rules to restore
equity to the system if this is enacted.  Of course, the poor currently have
little ability to prevent this from being enacted.  Are there enough
Officers to achieve Quorum?

And, of course, the Notary Election, in which neither the Threat nor the
Order are, strictly speaking, fielding a candidate. Although they are
pretty clearly taking sides.

A very good point. Such a change would have to wait until it were no
longer true that holding Office were the primary means of earning VTs.
Since that has only just become true recently, and seems to be having 
a salutary effect upon the game, I'm in no hurry to change it. So I guess
I won't be proposing 'No Free Voting' anytime soon.

There is something we could do however, to slightly encourage the kind
of Group-centred political activity we've seen in the current Elections
just a little more, and that is: we could extend the voting rights of
Groups to Elections.

####
Proto-Proposal
Groups can vote in Referenda

Be it hereby resolved that R1547 (Some Organizations Can Vote) be
amended to read:

      If an Organization is a Voting Entity then it is permitted to
      cast votes on Proposals, Referenda and Elections as if it were
      a Player. Such votes are cast by the Organization's Executor,
      acting on behalf of the Organization.
