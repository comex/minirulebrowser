Morendil, there is one active CFJ at the moment, 1124. Do you need me to
send it to you?

I got rid of a Rule that threatened the very foundations of the game.
You say that there was no such threat, had I not been prepared to misuse
my position as Distributor. But that is not so. Look at Chuck, for
example. It would have been possible for him to bury a scam Proposal
deep inside his weekly distribution of the Ruleset. He could have been
fairly confident that it would not be found there. And before we leap to
the conclusion that Chuck would never do such a thing, remember that he
buried a Blot amnesty for himself inside a long Proposal.

Summary Adoption presented a very tempting target to any Player whose
duties include the regular publication of long documents that Players
are unlikely to read from top to bottom. The Rulekeepor's Rulesets, the
Promotor's Proposal Queue, the Registrar's Report and the Accountor's
Report would all have served for the purpose. But I held none of those
of Offices.

Having said that, I wish to say that I have heard the arguments put by
Morendil among others, and I do recognize that the Distributor is not
quite like any Office, having special responsibilities to ensure the
trustworthiness of communications. Therefore I accept that there may
have to be some negative consequences for myself as a result of my
actions, if the best interests of the game are to be served. (My
resignation as CotC is an example of such a negative consequence.) But
Summary Adoption absolutely had to be repealed - that, too, was in the
best interests of the game. I am prepared to accept the consequences of
what I had to do in order to repeal it.

Nonsense. I have repealed a Rule. I have done nothing to prevent the
future adoption of safer versions of Summary Adoption, (eg, along the
lines proposed by Macross).
