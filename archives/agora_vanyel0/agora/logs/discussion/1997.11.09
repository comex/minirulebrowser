And I can see some good. When teleport packed up earlier in the year,
we switched to yoyo. Things went fine for a while, then yoyo started
to behave strangely. The moral: a triple failsafe can't hurt.

I assume we should ignore this post as well, since it seems clear
that Jeff's Judgements are in error.

If what you described had actually occurred, I wonder if this would fall
under the 'Non-performace by the Vote Collector' provisions in R1445?
Would you say that the Vote Collector had failed to announce the result,
or that he had announced an incorrect result?

Quite apart from the fact that what Scott sent is clearly marked not
as a Judgement but as an intended Judgement, there is also long-
established game custom that proto-Judgements can be sent without
counting as Judgements.

Oerjan is clearly correct about R1601. Nevertheless, I maintain that
the correct judgement of CFJ 1053 is FALSE, as elJefe found, although
of course for very different reasons, namely that an Executor in
Probate must be a Player.

In my opinion Oerjan's argument that Elde was in fact in probate is
quite convincing.

Yes, I have. I feel forced to spend less time on Agora, and one way to
do that is to drop the Office. Maybe I go even further and unsubscribe
from agora-discussion and/or go On Hold for a while. I hope to be able
to start playing more intensively again in a few weeks or months, and
be ready to take on some Office by then.

COE admitted. The above Payment Orders are hereby vacated.

My apologies, I hadn't read Rule 459 for a while, and thought the
Nomic Week started on Sunday instead of Monday.

I'm not sure on that question.  This, like most other Official
determinations, should be subject to a time limitation on challenge.
So, in this case, the law should hold that the announced winner is the
actual winner if the announcement is not challenged within some
reasonable time.  Officer indeterminancy is extremely destabilizing,
and we should revise things as necessary so as to avoid it as much as
possible.

I think it's pretty clear that Rule 1717 measures Senator-hood at the time
that Votes are cast, and only at that time.  But I suppose I'll propose a
clarification anyway.

"eir Votes are cancelled".   There is no reason to change them to

As I already mentioned, ABSTAINs are obsolete.
I would suggest simply

        Non-Senators cannot Vote on Senate Proposals.  If a
        non-Senator has Voted on a Proposal prior to its becoming a
        Senate Proposal, then eir Votes on that Proposal are
        cancelled, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding; and any
        delayed Transfer Orders submitted but not yet executed by eir
        Voting on that Proposal are cancelled.

This uses language similar to Rule 1442, and has the advantage that in
cases like Vir's, a Senator will be able to Vote again if e becomes a
Senator later in the Voting Period.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

Rule 452 supposedly allows the Assessor to say "Steve and Swann have Voted or
declared Presence on Proposal 4000", but makes it illegal to say "Two Players
have Voted or declared Presence on Proposal 4000".

I am not sure this is a flaw. The main reason for having an exception is
to remind people whether they have Voted, and publishing just a count
would not do that. The ability to see how many people have actually Voted
is just an interesting side effect.

I have even been thinking that there should be some opposite declaration
of Presence, so that Players can refrain from Voting without leaving those
obvious holes in the Voting reminder tables.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

Protoproposal Chaos2 [rev. 1]

Innocent Error Defense

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1575 be amended, by appending a
paragraph reading 

      Furthermore, it is a defense to any accusation of a Crime that
      the Player reasonably believed that eir actions were not a
      Crime at the time e performed them, or that e reasonably did not
      know that e was required to perform an action, when such
      nonperformance is defined as a Crime.  No Player shall be
      convicted of a Crime if this defense applies.

      announced results of an Election must be made within seven days

      the time the results are announced without a challenge, the
      announced results are presumed to be the true results of the

You give this same power to the Owner of the plot later in the 
proposal. I would recommend restricting this to the Assessor only 
changing unOwned plots.

I assume this is to destroy any Locations which have been turned into 
Plots?

You should repeat the statement about XYMN being numbers from 0-9, I 
think.

Does this allow the Bank to change Plots' names Without Objection, I 
wonder?

I am still rather suspicious of this, myself. Do we really need to 
make it possible to Win, in addition to being able to get an 
economically superior position?

Perhaps it would be better if the *Bank* payed that player. I'd hate 
to be the Registrar under that :-)

BTW, I notice that enough Energy is awarded to develop all five Mules 
immediately, provided you can get five Plots. If several are 
developed as Mines (and it's timed right), this would allow people to 
get up and running at full production immediately. That's bad, I 
think. Reduce the Energy award to 15, perhaps.

Good, my nice descriptive language is still there.  :-)

That allows one Mine to support four structures, and that's with at 
least one of each type. C'mon, we need a little *scarcity*! I think 1 
unit of Energy is about right (which means about 1 in 3 structures, 
depending on the degree people specialize, need to be Mines - more to 
allow people to change structures often)

I think Mines should just decrease production of adjacent Farms and 
Houses (lowers property values :-). Something like:

     A Farm's Production is increased by 0.5 VT for each House or
     Church to which it is Adjacent, and decreased by 1 VT for each
     Mine to which it is Adjacent.

     A House's Production is increased by 1 P-Note for every 2 Farms
     to which it is Adjacent, and decreased by 1 P-Note for every 2 
     Mines to which it is Adjacent.

     A Mine's Production is not affected by Adjacency.

The purpose of allowing the Assessor to post a list of Players who
have Voted or declared Presence on a Proposal is to allow the Assessor
to mass-confirm receipt of Votes and to remind Players of the
opportunity to Vote.  That the number of Votes cast can be imputed
from this is an unintended secondary benefit.

Protoproposal Chaos9 [rev. 1]

Fix Vizier Specification

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 721 be amended to read:

      The Vizier of a Group shall be whoever the Ordinances of that
      Group specify. If the Ordinances are silent, the Vizier shall be
      the Player who authored the ACO that created that Group, if e is
      still a Member of that Group.  If the Group was not created by
      the Execution of a ACO, the Vizier shall be whoever was the
      Vizier of that Group when it was first created.  

      If the Vizier thus specified is not a Member of the Group, the
      Group shall be dissolved.

      Unless the Ordinances of a Group specify otherwise, the
      Ordinancekeepor of a Group shall be its Vizier.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 721 be retitled "The Vizier and the
Ordinancekeepor".

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be created with the following text:

      If a given Group is a Voting Entity, then it shall be entitled
      to cast Vote(s) only as specified by its Ordinances.  If the
      Ordinances of the Group do not specify how the Group shall cast
      its Vote(s), it may not do so.

      A Group is not entitled to cast Votes on a Proposal if it did
      not exist at the beginning of the Voting Period of that
      Proposal.

      A Group with fewer than three Members is not entitled to cast
      Votes.

      The Vizier of a Group is responsible to communicate the Group's
      Votes to the Assessor.

[The current Rule 721 contains a terrible sentence fragment;
 furthermore, it has two basically unrelated provisions (Vizier and
 Ordinancekeepor, and Group Voting) lumped together into a single
 Rule.  This fixes the atrocious grammar and separeates the unrelated
 provisions into separate Rules.]
