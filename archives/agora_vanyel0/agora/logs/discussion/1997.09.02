I agree that an SFJ might be in order. Why not make it yourself, via
the Liaison?

This is all very interesting stuff. I think that part of the problem
is that there remains a fundamental unclarity at the very heart of
Internomic on the question of what it is for a member Nomic to be
a Player of Internomic. What kinds of obligations does this impose,
and upon whom, if anyone?

At any rate, it seems to me that your summary above misses one
possible position: first, you might hold that what it means for
Ackanomic (for example) to obey the Rules of Internomic is for
the individual Players of Ackanomic to obey the Rules of Internomic.
This would mean that Malenkai and the other conspirators would be
forbidden from altering the Ackanomic game state as the Rule demands,
provided that it wins any conflict it may have with other Ackanomic
Rules (and I have no idea whether it would or not). Note that you
don't have to believe that the proposed Rule would be automatically
added to Acka's Ruleset if it passed to hold this position. You don't
even have to believe that the proposed Rule would create an obligation
on the part of some Ackanomic Player or Players to add the Rule to
their Ruleset.

>It also seems that the way IN R101 is worded, it says that all member

That position was rejected in Agora long ago, which of course implies
nothing directly about how things might go in Internomic. Nevertheless,
the reasons for its rejection are as applicable to Internomic as they
are to Agora. The statement that "all member nomics must abide by the
Rules of Internomic" should not be understood as a definition of 'member
nomic', but rather as imposing an obligation of some kind on those members. 
Consider an analogous statement: "all drivers must obey the road rules".
Nobody would claim this implies that anyone who ignores a stop sign is
therefore not a driver.

InterNomic has exactly the same powers over its member Nomics as Agora does over its Players. It 
can place *any* obligation on a Member Nomic. Unless there is a penalty for disobedience, it 
doesn't accomplish much, but the power is still there.

Because I am not a player of any nomic in IN.  I am (for the moment) a
