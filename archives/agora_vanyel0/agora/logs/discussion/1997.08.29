This is the general rule for most mailing lists when you need

 Here's the general information for the list you've subscribed to,
 in case you don't already have it:

[Last updated on: Thu Aug 14 18:19:51 1997]
This is the Agora Nomic Discussion Mailing List. It is not designated
as a Public Forum, and messages which are required to be sent to the
Public Forum should not be sent here, but to the Public Forum lists
at either <agora-official@gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au> (for Official
messages) or <agora-business@gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au> (for other
Public Forum messages). 

As the name implies, this list is for discussion of Agora Nomic and
other commentary. As this is not a Public Forum, subscription to this
list is not a requirement to play. However, it is highly recommended
- this is where most of the fun is!

I am going to be away next week and in the interests of having
judicial business turned around quickly, it would be convenient for me
to be able to delegate the job of CotC to a willing party.
Applications on a postcard to a Public Forum near you (see R1645).

Michael.

I just wanted to inform you that you didn't send that Notary's Report to a
Public Forum.

Not entirely surprising, as you were part of the initial 3 data points for
the theory :-)

I would say that the requirements should be something more than what is
spelled out in the Rules, so those Entities don't count - the Rules
descibe completely what Players must do in response to them, so there is
no independent power granted to the entities themselves. 

But then there is a grey zone with some Injunctions, I guess - they are
very limited in their content.
