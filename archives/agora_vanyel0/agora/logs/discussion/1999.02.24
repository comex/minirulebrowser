Um, have you actually sent that Judgement to me in an official way? I
have no record of having received it.

The 'wishes' that Grover and I are talking about refer to the ability to
dispose of one's assets as one wishes, in R1873. Michael suggested that
even if for some reason Kolja had no control at all over his assets,
that my wishes as to how those assets should be disposed of legally
constitute Kolja's wishes, courtesy of R1478's provision that an
entity's Executor acts on behalf of that entity, as if e were that
entity. As I explained to Grover, I don't think much of this argument.

H. Herald Crito,

Is this a different PO to the one I paid for Kolja yesterday, or the same
one?

Steve,

That's the one you paid.  However, as Accountor I issued another Blot to Kolja after this report.
It's numbered POI172 and is still outstanding.

H. Herald Crito,

Is this a different PO to the one I paid for Kolja yesterday, or the same
