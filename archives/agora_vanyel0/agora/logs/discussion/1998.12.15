Eh?

We weren't talking about the constitution of the Board of Appeals, but
about Judge selection. Blob isn't proposing to change the Board of
Appeals; indeed he said that the current Board of Appeals structure
should be maintained as a safeguard against the dangers of politicizing
Judge selection.

Thanks... We definitely need to clean up the Rules concerning 
liabilities of new Officers who replace a former holder of the same
position who had duties pending.

To which Blob responded:

So elect a CotC you can trust! Make em issue an SLC promising not to
abuse the system. E could even promise to always select Judges randomly.
This rule change does not _force_ em to abuse it, you know.
<<

I think there are two issues adressed here: one, the arbitrariness of
the CotC's choice, if the choice isn't random. I think this is a good
thing - we've always wanted to give officers more power.

The second is whether this robs the judicial system of its
trustworthyness, which is an important requirement for the functioning
of the game, at least on the meta level. But I don't see how a
deliberate choice of judges can destroy that. There _are_ safeguards,
for example the possibility to bar players from judging a particular
CFJ, and the appeals process.

If enough players conspire to push through weird judgements, so that
you can't bar all of them, well, you're dealing with a major scam,
which should be fun and played out. If the CotC is only working
together with one or two buddies, well, then bar these buddies from
judging, and play out a political struggle for the CotC position.

Steve thinks that because this issue is so close to an essential
aspect of the game we should not risk anything. But if we never dare
to play close to the essentials, all that is left is hunting white
elephants. 

Blob continues:
>>
Our elections are never going to be interesting as long as we refuse 
to give our Officers any leeway. Who cares which CotC we elect at the 
moment? They are all forced to operate in exactly the same way! We might
as well go back to the "pick whoever volunteers first" mechanism.

We have all these interesting mechanisms in place - elections, impeachment, 
rebellion, etc, but we prevent them from having any real use because we
legislate our Officer's actions so tightly. Let's give them more room to
choose their actions, so we can have more fun electing someone we can
trust, and keeping them honest by threats of Rebellion or Impeachment. 
<<

I'd tend to agree. Of course we shouldn't unnecessarily run the risk
of shipwrecking the game, but some experimenting should be possible. 

The salaries aren't exactly a strong incentive to put work into the
officers' jobs, even less so at the moment. So some flexibility for
officers should be a good thing - rewarding them with some (limited)
political power, instead of some few VTs.

Steve commented on lee's judgement:
>>
I don't think you've really answered the question directly raised by the
CFJ, which is when the VPs for Proposals 3810-3812 ended. The question
of whether certain votes were legally cast is only secondary to the
Statement. Furthermore, while you say that you've read the arguments,
you don't offer any assessment of them, nor any justification of your
Judgement.
<<

Just a side remark; I guess it's obvious to veterans, but remarkable
nevertheless. I think what Steve expects a judge to do in this case is
an interesting illustration of the 'culture' of Agora - a judge should
broadly discuss the issue underlying a CFJ, and we are at least as
interested in the judge's general argument as we are in the final
verdict. 

These expectations have nothing to do with the rules as written. In
that sense there is nothing lee could be reproached for. But clearly
CFJs on such issues are more an instrument to establish game custom in
a semiformal way, and less a quick way to resolve conflicts (as in the
initial rules).

Ok, I should have responded more directly to this concern, it's true.  8)

I don't think what you call 'set and forget' is supported by R101,
in this case.  If the Rules specify that an entity exists with
such-and-such properties, then, IMO, R101 forces us to assign
those properties to those entities, whatever game custom may
seem to indicate (Rules take precedence over game custom).
In my experience, admittedly lesser than yours here, game custom
supports the view that 'set and forget' works when the Rules fall
silent about the existence or the properties of an entity, but not
when they specify those properties directly.  For example, suppose
a proposal passes that changes the Rules into specifying explicitly
that Indulgences are no longer a Currency. Would you argue that
all Indulgences minted prior to the proposal's passage were *still*
Currency? I think that would be mistaken.  And I think the current
situation is analagous.

The Guillotine does not have to act retroactively to change the current
property of a current entity.  I don't see how this Rule favors one of
these viewpoints over the other.  Before the G takes effect, the VP
is seven days long.  At the moment the G takes effect, the VP is
changed to be something less than seven days long.

Part of our problem here is with the definition of what it means for the
"conclusion of the Voting Period" to occur.  At the moment we seem
to have different definitions.  I would say that the conclusion of those VPs
*did* occur upon passage of "Ten Days...", but that event was not
specified directly by the Rules (and need not be).  It is an event that
occurred as a result of the application of the Rules.

I agree with your conclusion about how this example would work,
but I do not agree that it is analagous with the current situation.
"Repealing a Rule" is an action/event in and of itself.  That
action here is directly specified by the Rules and R108 prevents
the Rules themselves from deeming actions to have occurred in
the past.  In the current situation, no action is directly specified by
the Rules.  It is the action of time itself moving through a date
specified by the Rules that we think of as an event, but R108
does not prevent the Rules from attaching legal significance to
any date we want.  It just prevents that legal significance from
having any action in the past.

 A better analogy would be a viral statement.  "This Rule shall be
without effect for two weeks beginning on 1 Dec, 1998".  Then,
on 10 Dec we pass a proposal that either 1) changes this to, "This
Rule shall be without effect for one week beginning on 1 Dec, 1998";
or 2) eliminates the sentence entirely.  Would you say that the Rule
remains permanently ineffective because we never got to the end
of the two week period specified in the first version of the Rule before
we changed it?

 It seems to me that the natural interpretation of 2) is that the Rule
immediately becomes effective again upon passage of the proposal.
Any other interpretation seems weird to me.  (Of course, just because
something is weird doesn't mean it's wrong.)  But if that holds for 2)
then it must also hold for 1), because 2) is equivalent to a change which
says "This Rule shall be without effect for zero weeks beginning on
1 Dec, 1998".  IMO, the current situation is identical to 1) above.

Even though I took over as successor to Michael, wouldn't an

valid?

The preponderence of evidence gives that Crito is Justiciar.

Note: This also means that my call for an Election for this Office was
not correct, and probably has no official meaning.

It's the more remarkable in that this has been a gradual redevelopment
from the almost opposite side.  In Nomic World, where many of our initial
Players came from, there was a point made of the fact that the _only_
authority of a Judgement was in its True/False verdict.  This was, I
believe, a result of an initial crisis in NW when Judge Lindrum attempted
to grossly abuse his judicial powers, which were subsequently clearly
limited to avoid a repeat.  I believe that quite a while into Agora
itself, the echo of this crisis kept judicial powers to a minimum.

I guess an important factor has been the development of Rule 217, and the
interpretation of "past Judgements" there as including the arguments as
well.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

Sorry, misread Rule 1555. I thought that a retirement-without-removal
was not a ground for ceasing to be the Electee. Thanks for your correction.
Morendil, if you read this: This means you are to hold an Election for
Registrar as well.

I think I see this state of affairs slightly differently. Ørjan is right
to point to Lindrum's coup d'etat in Nomic World as a major influence on
the development of NW's judicial system, and hence of Agora's, since we
inherited many of those ideas. But I wouldn't describe the what has
happened as a change in our attitudes towards Judges' arguments. In
fact, I don't think our attitude to arguments has really changed that
much since we first curtailed the power of Judges by restricting them to
delivering verdict of TRUE or FALSE on particular statements. Then as
now, arguments have been seen to be important in showing how a Judge
justifies eir verdict. A manifestly bad argument undermines the
legitimacy of the Judgement it accompanies - not legally so much as
socially, i.e., such a Judgement is almost certain to be appealed. On
the other side of the coin, a menifestly good argument is likely to be
established as game custom and be appealed to when deciding future
cases. But as Kolja notes, this is all semi-formal only, and I'm not
sure how much of an expansion of Judicial power it really represents. I
think that the only part of a Judge's Judgement with any formal legal
important is the actual verdict of TRUE or FALSE, and even then the
exact legal significance of the verdict can be unclear. (I do agree that
Judicial power has slowly been re-inflated in Agora, but I don't think
that you can find much evidence for this in our attitudes towards
Judge's arguments.)

Actually, it isn't a bug at all.  The Rule was written that way by design.
We discussed what effect going on Hold should have and concluded that one
should not go on Hold when one has obligations pending.  I would not be
opposed to a change in the Rule if others think this is too harsh.  Saying
something like "continuously for 14 days excepting days on Hold" would work,
no?

As for the way in which the Rule operates:  I intentionally turned the
normal mechanism on its head.  I did this for two reasons:  1) it made the
algorithm simpler while achieving almost identical results; 2) it makes it
easier to add additional ways of satisfying one's Duty.  Actually, now that
I think about it, there was a third reason:  I thought it would be
interesting to see how this type of mechanism would interact with Rules
designed with the more usual mechanism in mind.

I had been thinking that we might allow the Promotor to determine if a
submitted Proposal should satisfy one's Duty (subject to appeal of course).
In fact I recently submitted a null proposal simply to see if anyone would
react to it.  No one did so I assume that no one really minds if people
dodge their Duty.

Actually, you weren't the first to try this. Kolja submitted 'A
minimalist proposal' a few weeks before.

I've had the same thought, and I think I'll submit a Proposal to that
effect.

Hm, I have to admit that at first blush, I like your analogy better than
mine. I shall have to think on this some more.

Your view kind of connects up with some arguments in the philosophical
literature about time, specifically, the question of whether there can
be time without change. In that literature, a distinction is made
between a 'genuine change' in something's properties, and a 'merely
Clayton's change', where the latter is a kind of change in something's
properties whixch results purely from the passage of time, like the
difference between being 5 minutes old and 6 minutes old. A similar
distinction seems to be emerging here between 'genuine events' and
'merely Clayton's events', where the latter result just from the passage
of the 'now pointer' through a particular moment.
