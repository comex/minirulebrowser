I should note that the distinction between these two models is academic,
since the same votes are counted under both. :)

That would make sense. P1564, which introduced the 10 day Voting Period,
took effect on April 28, 1995, one of the Proposals 1563-1580 which all
took effect that day when I (Assessor at the time) announced the
results. (Interestingly, the Virus was also among these Proposals,
created by P1573.)

All these Proposals were distributed by Promotor Coren on April 21,
1995. Had the view been taken that the extension of the length of the
Voting Period applied to the P1563-1580, then, since the results were
announced almost as soon as the 7-day VPs concluded, well before any
10-day VPs would have concluded, indeed the VPs would have had to be
reopened. However, they were not, and this further supports the idea
that game custom holds that the VP of a Proposal is fixed at the time it
is distributed.

Thanks for digging that up, Steve.  There's one important difference
between that and the present cast, though: when R693 became infected,
its voting period was unspecified by the Rules, rather than (as in the
current case) specified to be something otehr than what it originally
was.  This (it seems to me) is consistent with the designation model:
R693/1 set the VP to be a period of 10 days, and the designation
remained so once left unspecified by the Rules.  It also
seems to me that this is inconsistent with the event model--in
the event model, the VP should not have expired on Sept. 18, as
there was nothing in the Rules at that time which would cause it
to expire.

As you note, though, it's also consistent with a fourth model which
I forgot to list in my previous message:

IV.  The voting period is set in stone when a Proposal is distributed,
and cannot be subsequently changed.  (Under this model, of course,
the VP of Proposals 3810-3812 ends at D+10.)

I forgot to list this one in my previous message because I thought
it severely flawed; however, I should have done so for the sake of
completeness.  I believe it is inconsistent with R101 (which makes
no exception for the voting periods of proposals), not to mention
our game custom that R1726, The Guillotine, is effective.

With that I would agree.

It seems we have three proposed models of the VP:

I. The VP is a designation of a time period.  If this is the case,
such designation can be retrospective (I'll use this to mean the
designation of an earlier date at a later date, not to be confused
with retroactive.)  The advantage of this is that it corresponds
to my argument in CFJ 944; also, it seems to me the interpretation
which best corresponds to the wording of Rule 693:

      The prescribed Voting Period for a Proposal is seven days,
      beginning at the time the Proposal is distributed to all
      Players.

(If it said, "the Voting Period for a Proposal begins when the
Proposal is distributed, and ends seven days after the Proposal
is distributed," then the wording would better correspond with
the event model.)

The disadvantage of the designation model is that it can be quite
confusing.

The designation model, like my July 4 example, would imply that
the end of the VP was at D+7.  However, it can still be argued
that even under the designation model, votes cast between
D+7 and D+7.1 (which is what I'll call the time that P3809
took effect, even thought that's not quite accurate--and yes,
I realize no one attempted to cast votes between D+7 and D+7.1,
but it's still an interesting question) are valid and should
be counted.  R683 says "A Voting Entity votes upon a Proposal when,
during the Voting Period of that Proposal..." which can be
taken to mean that the act of voting is dependent upon
whether it was cast within the voting period, as defined
at the time the vote was cast.  (I would argue that voting
is an event which cannot be retroactively changed, even if
the VP itself is a designated time period.)  Further, if
we were to accept the designation model, we would almost
have to accept that voting was an event in this way, lest we be forced to
go back and recalculate the results of P2000, based on its newly
designated voting period of seven days rather than ten!  (This is
precisely the issue I declined to comment on in my judgement of
CFJ 944, and now you see why. :)

In short, the VP is retrospectively changed to end at D+7, but
votes cast between D+7 and D+7.1 are still counted.  (If voting
itself is treated as an event.)

II. The event model, discussed recently by myself and Steve.
As already argued, under this model the VP has not ended, and
will not under the current rules.  However, I am not sure that the
wording of R693 supports the event model.

III. Andre's model, in which the VP ends at D+7.1.  I'm not sure I
understand the theoretical basis behind this (sorry, I deleted the post
describing it), so perhaps, Andre, you'd like to expound on it a bit more?

OK, let me try one more time to list and rename the models of the voting period
which have been at least suggested, although not necessarily actively
espoused, in the past few days:

Designation/Designation model: both the VP and just what is a vote are
  designations which can be retrospectively changed.  Result: the VP
  ended at D+7, and only votes cast before D+7 are counted.

Designation/Event model: the VP is a designation which can be retrospectively
  changed, but voting is an event and cannot be altered after the fact.
  Result: the end of the VP is at D+7, but votes cast up to D+7.1 are
  counted.  

Event model: the end of the VP is an event, which must be triggered by
  a Rule in effect at the time it says the VP ends.  Result: the VP
  has not yet ended, nor will it without further legislation.  

Andre's model: [basis to be filled in] Result: the VP ended at D+7.1, and
  votes cast up to D+7.1 are counted.

Set-in-stone model: the VP is set when a Proposal is distributed and
  cannot be subsequently changed.  Result: the VP ends at D+10,
  and votes cast up to D+10 are counted.

(This is, of course, for information only.  I hope it is clear by now
that I do not think these models are all equally supported by the Rules. :)

I think you're running together two issues which should be kept
carefully separated. The first is whether the end of the Voting Period
is an event. The second is whether the length of the VP of a Proposal is
an attribute of the Proposal which is fixed when it is distributed. The
treatment of P3550 is not inconsistent with the event model, for one
could take the view (I don't call it my view, since I'm still trying to
figure out what I think about all this) that P3550's VP was fixed at 10
days when it was distributed, a fact which was not changed by the
subsequent infection of R693. The conclusion of P3550's VP on Sep. 18,
1997, would then be understood as an event caused by P3550's having a
certain property.

Once again I think you are too quick to claim that there is an
inconsistency here. The Guillotine acts directly and specifically to
change the length of the VP of a particular Proposal. No-one disputes
that it is within the power of the Rules to do this. But the action of
R1726 is quite different to the case of the infection of R693, in which
a general Rule ceases to have effect for a period of time. In that case
there is no reason to think the length of the VP of any particular
Proposal has been affected, and so the Proposals retain whatever
attributes they already had.

Emerging from all these discussions is what I shall the Attribute Model.
According to the Attribute Model, the length of the VP of a Proposal is
an an attribute of that Proposal which is determined at the time the
Proposal is distributed, as long the attribute is defined by the Rules
at the time the Proposal is distributed. Rules like the Guillotine can
act to change the nature of this attribute in specific cases. Amendments
to R693 do not act to change the nature of such attributes. The
Attribute Model is consistent with the historical cases:

1. All of P1563-1580 had VPs of a week. P1564's amendment of R693 did
not alter this fact.

2. P3550 had a VP of 10 days. The infection of R693 did not alter this
fact.

3. Proposals distributed during the infection of R693 did not have
defined VPs when they were distributed, and did not inherit them until
the disinfection of R693. See CFJ 944.

The Attribute Model implies that:

4. P3810-3812 had VPs of 10 days. P3809's amendment of R693 did not
alter this fact.

OK, let's see if I can summarize the various game customs which have been
brought up, and which ones are consistent with which models.  (I cannot
determine whether they are consistent with Andre's model without
understanding it. :)

Lengthening of VPs upon adoption of P1564:
  Consistent with: Event, Set-in-Stone (SIS)
  Violates: Designation/Designation (D/D), Designation/Event (D/E)

Infection of R693, during the VP of P3550:
  Consistent with: D/D, D/E, SIS
  Violates: Event

Infection of R693, prior to the VPs of certain Proposals (subject of CFJ 944):
  Consistent with: D/D, D/E (were votes cast after D+10 but before disinfection
                             counted here?  Whether they were or not would
                             violate one of these two)
  Violates: SIS(?), Event

Effectiveness of Guillotine, R1726 (don't know the Proposal(s) off-hand,
                                    but I know we've had one or two):
  Consistent with: D/D, D/E, Event
  Violates: SIS

Why isn't it? R1011 defines a Nomic Property to be "any property of any
entity which that entity possesses solely by the virtue of the Rules
defining that property." It sounds to me like the Voting Period of a
Proposal is almost a paradigm case of a Nomic Property.

But this - the changing after the fact of the legal significance of
General Chaos' action - I claim is a prohibited retroactive application
of a Rule, within the meaning of R108. It will not do to say that you
are merely changing - in the present - the description of what happened
in the past. General Chaos' act of voting is an event which did - or did
not - happen in the past. If you change the description of Chaos'
message from "legal vote" to "legally insignificant text", then you are
in effect changing the past - acting retroactively.

I guess one could call it the state model: The Ruleset at any given time
describes which Proposals are in their VP. Before the adoption of the
Proposal, the Rules told us the voting period was from D to D+10, so
we were in the voting period at times between D+7 to D+7.1. After the
adoption, the Rules told us the voting period was from D to D+7, so we
were not in the Voting Period. Therefore, in effect the Voting Period
ended at time D+7.1, when the proposal took effect.

As Assessor, I am holding that this does not affect the Voting Periods
of Proposals already made.  It seems reasonable to me that the Voting
Periods of these Proposals was established when they were distributed.

Now, the Voting Period of any Proposal made while Rule 693 remains
infected is open to question.  I believe I shall interpret such
Proposals to have an indefinite Voting Period; Guillotines will be
needed to end Voting on such Proposals.

I am not certain that I fully agree.  Take, for instance, the case
where an amendment shortens the Voting Period.  This might have the
effect of causing some Voting Periods in progress at the time of the
adoption of the amendment to end prior to the adoption of the
amendment.  This strikes me as a prohibited retroactive effect.

I believe this is in error.  To apply the standard of Rule 693/3 to
Proposals made prior to its disinfection strikes me as a prohibited
retroactive effect.  It is my opinion that all Proposals distributed
during Rule 693's infection are forever deprived of a Voting Period,
short of adopting a measure which specifically grants those Proposals
an exceptional Voting Period.

This has to be one of the most interesting infections we've had yet.

Were I entitled to seek a "fair and equitable" solution, I would hold
that the Voting Periods should begin at the time of disinfection.
However, the Rules of Agora need be neither fair nor equitable. :)

Why does this change things in the past? If GC's votes were never legal,
the voting period having ended (or, as Andre would have it, the voting
period not active at the moment he voted) , then the issue is moot. Now,
if he had voted between D+7 and D+7.1, that's a different question.

I deliberately left out the grandfather clause in order to create this

I've already elaborated why I think my Proposal is superior to
Crito's, and generally a good idea.  My main goal was to reduce
paperwork for recordkeepors by shifting debt tracking to creditors,
while at the same time allowing creditors considerable leeway to
decide how vigorously to enforce debts.  My Proposal also does away
with Probate, which most people seem to think is something worth doing
away with.

If you want to bring in a new paradigm for handling currencies, then by
all means go ahead and vote for Scott's proposal.  However, if you are
not ready for this kind of a (relatively) major shift in currency handling,
then my proposal will alleviate some of the excess paperwork caused
by the current system.  I do not feel, as Scott does, that there is much
increased danger in turning the Bank into a joint account for Officers (which is
what my proposal amounts to).

This is one of my major concerns about Crito's proposal; it tends to
increase the uncertainty of Currency Holdings by forcing Recordkeepors
to make more complex decisions in order to determine whether a
Transfer Order is valid.

(It also continues to use the Order paradigm for transfers, which in
retrospect was a bad idea.)

And what is the answer to that question? If Andre's position implies
that votes cast between D+7 and D+7.1 would have their legal statuses
retroactively changed, then I think that's a serious (indeed, fatal)
problem with Andre's position, even if there weren't actually any votes
cast during that period.

Really? Or are you pulling my leg?

Actually, no disrespect intended, but it's a little hard to believe that
this is really true. Your previous statements both from the past few
days, and the ones you dug up and reposted for Chuck from September last
year, all pretty consistently show that you believe that the VP for a
Proposal is established when it is distributed. If you have that view,
then grandfathering clauses are not necessary.

Really.  I considered putting one in but decided not to because it
might lead to an interesting situation regarding the voting periods of
Proposals outstanding at the time of its adoption.  It would appear
that my apprehension was correct.

So?  From those same statements, you could also conclude that I knew
that the issue was reasonably subject to dispute, and that I might
therefore see a point to draft in a grandfather clause to eliminate
all doubt.  As it happens, I am rather undecided on the issue; there
are good arguments all around.  I encourage the Judge of the CFJ I
believe I saw called to write a strong, solid opinion that will
resolve the questions presented in a clear manner that will able to
serve as a guide to resolve future disputes of this nature.

In my opinion these wordings are completely equivalent. I don't think
there's any support for the designation model in the wording of R693,
nor do I think that any argument against the idea that the beginning and
end of the VP are both events can be constructed based on the wording of
R693. Finally, I don't think there's any argument against the Attribute
Model to be had out of R693, either.

And yet, as far as I can tell, Proposals 3552-3554, which were
distributed while R693 was infected (on Sep. 22, 1997), were assigned
normal 10 day Voting Periods. It's a little difficult to find out what
was going on though, because I think that just around this time, the
first wave of the Pragmatic Currencies crisis broke, and we had to
recalculate a few months of the game state. Maybe you can dig up from
your archives more specific discussions of how the VPs of P3552-3554
were determined?

The question is, though: is that necessary? It seems possible to have
the view that the way R693 operates is to assign to each Proposal a VP
as it is distributed, in which case a subsequent amendment to R693 need
not have any effect on the VPs of Proposals already distributed. In
other words, the Attribute Model seems a logically consistent view.
It also seems to be game custom.

Here's what I think is a better analogy using Chuck's July 4 example.
Imagine that there is a law that says that flag-burning is illegal on
any anniversary of the US's birthday. But now also imagine that the US's
birthday has been traditionally celebrated on some other day, say
Jefferson's birthday (whenever that is). But, times change, people fall
out of favour, and now there's a movement to change the birthday of the
nation to something more appropriate, say, July 4, 1776. Congress is
roused to act, and the legislation is enshrined in law.

The question now arises: assuming that the retroactive effects of
legislation are prohibited, can individuals who engaged in perfectly
legal flag-burning on July 4 last year now be prosecuted? Of course they
can't, that would be a retroactive application of the law.

I only have archives of my own messages that far back, unfortunately,
and my brief tenure as Promotor ended before then.

My Assessor's Records show that Proposals 3552 through 3554 were
distributed by Promotor Crito at Mon, 22 Sep 1997 14:27:07 -0400.  I
can find no record of my having participated in any discussion of what
the voting period of these Proposals should properly have been.

That's not at all analogous.  The U.S. Constitution prohibits
ex post facto laws, which is exactly what you describe above.
In Agora, it would be completely legal for a Rule to penalize
a Player in the present for an act which that Player committed
long before the Rule took effect.  For example, a Rule, newly
enacted, saying "As soon as possible after this Rule takes
effect, the Assessor shall bill each Player who voted FOR P301
10 VTs" would be fully effective.

In fact, note my annotation of Rule 108:

[CFJ 1: This does not prevent Rules from being explicitly dependent on
 circumstances before they are enacted.]

The point was not to talk about punishment, which of course cannot be
inflicted in the past, but about the legal status of the act of
flag-burning. To say "that particular act of flag-burning, which was
legal when it was committed, we now say was illegal and a prosecutable
offence" is retroactive application of the law, not mere redescription
in the present of facts about the past (as Morendil and Andre would have
it).
