Also one person could, be very annoying just calling random 
impeachments.  Although I doubt whether that would make them very 
popular.

I would call that "mildly annoying" rather than "very annoying."

Especially since the Player who calls for the Referendum is the Player 
who must collect its Votes and announce its Results.  No burden is
established on the other Players to do anything, except perhaps to
Vote AGAINST.

This would mean that judges couldn’t give judicial orders weeks or 
months after a CFJ is closed.  Basically, they would have to make sure 
they gave any such orders straight after their judgement.  I also 
realise that such a proposal might find it hard to gain support.  


Protoposal      No old judges

Create a rule with the following text.

1 week after a CFJ is closed, the Judge of that CFJ is recused.


I’m not sure about the time 1 week might be too short.  Also a "this 
rule takes precedence over…." Or a "this rule defers to….." clause might 
be useful.  To be honest I hadn’t given it much thought.  It just 
occurred to me whilst going over CFJ1117.

I added that provision; it was intentional.  I will oppose this.
