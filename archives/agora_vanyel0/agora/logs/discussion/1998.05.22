I think that any argument whose conclusion is that the Rules cannot
prohibit the actions of free-willed Players is silly. And I don't
think that any pragmatist is properly understood as advancing such an
argument. What the pragmatist should be understood as claiming is
that the Rules cannot *prevent* free-willed Players from doing that
which is, nonetheless, prohibited. So, I *do* regard Electioneering
as prohibited. But this alone has no effect on whether I am actually
capable of Electioneering - of course I am, I just choose not to. And
that's quite separate from the issue of the circumstances, if any, in
which it might be legitimate for me to choose to do so.

I saw the loophole almost immediately but wasn't going to exploit it...
but in the end it was too tempting.  Now the only question is what to
do with it?  I was thinking perhaps that Swann should be given the 
Patent Title of "Deposed Dictator" or something similar and perhaps a
holiday named "Independence Day" be created in honor of this whole
thing (note that a Patent Title and a holiday are two things Swann
said he wanted out of this whole situation... be careful what you ask
for you just might get it! :) ).  I'm tempted to take a win for myself,
but it really is Swann's scam and I'm just riding his coat tails.  Due
to the (thus far) successful counter-scam, obviously Swann won't be
getting a win (at least in so far as I can continue to hold power).
I hope there's no hard feelings Swann?  :)  

I hope that since I am not proposing to force anyone to do anything (my
Orders for Swann to Vacate his Orders were more for show and to smooth
the appeals process than anything else) that no one else will decide
to Depose me from my dictatorship but then I can do nothing to prevent
that short of forcing the adoption of changes to the Rules which I am
not prepared to do.

As the primary author of the Order paradigm do you have any ideas on
how this matter should be resolved?  How best to close this loophole?

Chancellor Michael and Accountor Crito will, of course, exercise their
new powers as they see fit, but I thought I'd express my own personal
preferences about what values of the BOS and VTCL I'd like to see
at the moment. 

In line with my earlier comments, I think a BOS of about 0.5 VTs
would be appropriate at the moment. At last Accountor's Report there
were 110 VTs in circulation and 14 Players - about 8 VTs/player. VTs
seem appropriately scarce to me at the moment; at any rate I see no
immediate need for taxes to be levied, so I'd recommend a VTCL of
around 9, with possible adjustments to follow depending on how things
work out with the new BOS.

Just my $0.02.

'Tis unfortunate that we have a situation where anyone who wants can now
register and claim absolute power. I don't think this is avoidable at
the moment, until the loophole is fixed.  For the nounce I'm looking
for a legal way to deal with this ASAP.

I shall try to write a proto to "repair" this situation within the
next few days.  (This is getting somewhat amusing.)

Swann, it should be noted that it is not stylish to repeatedly attempt
to salvage a scam once it starts to fall apart. :)

After such careful treading to stay within the law, I have screwed up 
immensly.  I have done something I view as a violation of the rules and
for that I am deeply sorrowful.  I want everyone to know that it was
unintentional, and that I have taken measures to rectify the situation
the moment I realized it had happened-- I truly wish I could un-mail
something.  I have, myself, issued a CFJ upon my criminal starus, and I
will most likly be required to deliver a "formal" apology for my
aggregious act.  I find myself in the position of being the very type of
player whom I've campainged so hard against, a criminal.  Perhaps some
will see this as poetic justice, if I was more distant from the
situation I would probably see some humor in it myself.  I myself feel
ashamed of acting, accidentily maybe, in an inexcusable manner-- for
that I apologize to everyone, especcially Macross (to whom I have
already given a Kudo.)

For those who care:
I'm using netscape mail. And I was working in the unsent message
folder.  I drafted the formatting fix of the "The Coup Lives!" message,
and also, as a brainstorm, wrote up the "No New Player Tyranny" message
at the same time.  My intent wile writing it was to wait and send it
after Macross vacated the orders phrohibiting me from issuing it. 
Somehow, in a great flash of brain-death, I didn't send the individual
"The Coup Lives!" message by itself, I used the "Send Unsent Messages"
command.  I think I realized what I did before my finger was completly
off the mouse button.  The scream of profanity that resulted was
probably heard as far as Detroit.  I hope that the promtness of my
response to this error will convince the Agora community that it was a
genuine error, and not a willful act.


Again, I deeply apologize.

Swann

If the scam is falling apart, it was because of my inoppourtune message,
"No New Player Tyranny" and not for any other reason.  I believe that
the scam is as pure and as effective as any produced during my
Playership.  The theroy is sound, and with the exection of my recent
brain-fart in the PF, so has been the execution.

I will not comment on the "stylishness" of my own scam except to say
that I've probably infinitly degraded it after that *&*@#$ message.

What exactly is the "type" of an Order?  The only evidence that I can
find that the Rules even contemplate that Orders have type is in Rule
1796, and no Rule whatsoever formally typifies any particular species
of Order.  

Because of this, I am unclear as to the import of Swann's Orders, and
of their scope.

On a second issue, while it is not explicitly defined what it means
for an Order to be "improperly executed", Rule 1695 certainly suggests
that an order "made for an improper purpose" is improperly executed.
The Judges of the instant CFJs should consider this.

Same here, actually. Swann's claiming, more or less, that an Order's
"type" is the set of characteristics that the Rules recognize certain 
subsets of the class 'Orders' by, e.g. a Transfer Order is an Order 
that applies to a Recordkeepor and requires em to note the transfer
of some Currencies from the Player issuing it to some other entity.

My own opinion is that the notion of an Order's 'type' is not well
enough defined that eir prohibition against issuing Orders of a 
'type' not 'defined in the Rules' is null and void. I also concur 
with you in the assessment that codifying 'types of Orders' would
not be necessary or even useful.

Rule 1695 only applies to Judicial Orders, though. There's no reason
to think that different criteria might not apply to Administrative or
Private Orders.

I think that is an excessive reach to deny the word "type" of its
generic english meaning.  It, I think, is doing violence to the language
to imply that a Transfer Order, for instance, is not a type of Order.
I think any reasonable person should read the given language in the
Order to refer to the english language, and not some special esoteric
meaning defined in the Ruleset.  The way I read this Objection is that
it says that, since the rules do not define the word "type" the word
"type" has no meaning.  I find that an outrageous proposition, and I
wonder if you could possibly make the same argument if I had used the
word "kind of Order" rather than "type of Order."

That is another reach.  The logical, obvious and intuitive meaning of
the phrase "improperly executed," is to mean that it was executed by
procedures not defined for that type--ahem--kind of Order.  For
instance, if I executed a private Order for Oerjan by sending the Order
to Steve, it would be improperly executed.  Ditto if I sent a TO for
P-Notes to the Herald.  You are imposing an excessively obtuse
definition on a phrase with an otherwise obvious and intuitive meaning.

As for "improper purpose--" In the absence of any definition I believe
the only reasonable interpretation of "improper purpose" is a purpose
that intends to flout the Rules.  I have made one Order that I think
could be deemed "improper" in this sense, and I have vacated it.  All
other Orders I have made have been in accord with the Rules, and barring
a rule saying that they are improper, I believe they are proper.  Which
may, in fact, be beside the point, since the language of 1695 only
considers the propriety of a Judicial Order, which means that 1695 has
no authority whatsoever over any order I have made.

And no reason to think that the same critera might apply too. :)

The problem I have is that it's not clear to me that Orders can be
divided into those of "types explictly defined by the Rules" and
"types not explicitly defined by the Rules".  This means to me that
you have either ordered everyone (except yourself) from issuing any
orders, or not issuing any orders at all.

Purportedly, I am ordered to:

        Refrain from issuing any Administrative, Judicial, Appellate or
        Private Order that is of a kind that is not explicitly defined 
        in the Rules.  Nor shall e issue any such Order except in such
        circumstances where Rules explicitly permit em to issue such an
        Order. If e has made an Order that does not conform to these
        criteria, e must vacate it.

As far as I can tell, there are no orders of any kind which are not
one of Administrative, Judicial, Appellate, or Private, and any order
I might issue is of one of these kinds, all explicitly defined by the
Rules, so the first restraint is null.  I am explictly permitted to
issue Orders by Rule 116, so the second restraint is null.  I have
made no Orders (as far as I know) recently, so the third command is
null.

BTW Swann, you're not acting in any Official position here so there's 
no need to send all that stuff to a-o, the a-b list should do.

You mean no reason not to think so, I guess...

I think we can safely assume that different criteria apply to
Private Orders than to Judicial Orders, for instance. As an example,
all Transfer Orders other than those executed by the Chancellor for
the Bank are Private Orders; a Transfer Order clearly need not always
be "appropriate for the situation", as I can certainly Order the
Recordkeepor for Voting Tokens to note a 1 VT transfer for me to
Swann, on a whim as it were, without being required to justify the
appropriateness of such an action. On the other hand, suppose that I
lend 1 VT to Swann; then my issuing an Order requiring him to
transfer one VT to me would certainly be "appropriate for the
situation", but would that make it valid ? I think that would depend
on the conditions of my agreement with Swann.

You're probably right in that, as a matter of ettiquite.  I guess
that I saw this all as "important" enough to be published in a-o
but now that there seems to be more of a "routine" to these orders
and amendments therof I suppose you're right in that they should be
restricted to a-b.  Which I'll do from this point on.

Well (knowing what I indended with the order) I would counter that it is
fairly obvious that the language intends to restrict the subsets of
those particular classes of Orders.  I think it is an obtuse
interpretation to say that the phrase "An Administrative Order of a kind
explicitly defined in the Rules" refers to all Administrative Orders
because an "Administrative Order" is defined in the Rules. The argument
confuses levels of meaning that should be obvious and distinct.

However, if this confusion does persist, I'll simply forbid anything
that isn't a Payment Order, Transfer Order, or an Order to change
someone's Score and be done with it until the whole Order mess is fixed.
That's more restrictive than I wished to be, but if that's the only way
it works, it's the only way it works...

Sheesh, I don't know how many amendments I've made to these Orders so
far, but it makes me glad they aren't rules :)

I guess it shows why a scam involving a cabal of conspiritors would tend
to go smoother.  It helps to have people to bounce ideas and possible
objections off of.  Most of the flaws in language, and in oversights,
wouldn't have happened, I suspect, if it was a Group to exploit the
loophole and not a lone gunman, so to speak.  This may be an argument
for individualists like myself-- who're interested in the occasional
scam-- to form a Group to have some feedback on things like this.  I
honestly suspect, if some member of the Threat had gotten this idea,
there would have been enough internal debate, and enough heads
critiquing the scam, that it would have gone a lot smoother.  It
certianly wouldn't have suffered from either the oversight about new
players or the various problems people had with the Orders' language.

Of course, as past Threat scams have shown, scams by a cabal are no more
immune to the occasional misfire :)

That still leaves me free to amend as I will, given the presumtive
validity of my Orders in the first place.  So I guess I'll just have to
upset General Chaos, again.

When I saw he was going for amending his orders, I couldn't believe I
had let it slip through my fingers that easily, but when I saw his
error I was even more amazed.  I believe that if Swann had just taken
a little time he would have seen the error and would have won the
day.  His frequent amendments clearly show how rushed the effort was.
It's too bad because I think it was a pretty good scam.

Hmmm.....  In light of the fact that Swann can now only issue Orders
on my say so I think a Patent Title of "Puppet Dictator" would be
appropriate.  Would the appropriate way to grant him such a Patent
Title be a rule like:

	   There shall exist a Patent Title of "Puppet Dictator".
        Swann holds the title of Puppet Dictator.

or is there another mechanism for this?

Correct.  However, an Order is Amended by an Order to Amend, which 
Order you can only make using palindromes.  Good luck!  :)

Not so, there can be an Order to amend, but I believe there is no
support in the rules for saying that an Order cannot be changed by fiat.
In fact, an "Order to amend" doesn't even make sense in terms of the
definition given by 1793.  What entity am I Ordering, what am I
commanding it to do or not do?  If "Ordering" is the only means by
which my Orders could change, then I believe your first Order would have
phrohibited it.

You are in contempt by action, I believe.  I ask you on your honor
as a law abiding Agoran citizen to vacate your most recent Orders
to Amend.  If you do I for one will not call for criminal proceedings
on the matter as I believe this was an innocent mistake.

Rule 1799/0 (Power=1)
Amendment, Stay, and Vacation of Orders

      Any Order may always be amended, stayed, or vacated by the
      Player (or, in the case of Appellate Orders, Board of Appeal)
      who executed it.  Certain classes of Orders may be amended,
      stayed, or vacated in other circumstances as well, when the
      Rules so allow.  In all cases, this is done by an Order to
      Amend, Stay, or Vacate, respectively, the original Order.

      Otherwise, an Order shall not be amended, stayed, vacated, or
      otherwise changed once executed.



Amending an order cannot be done by fiat because the Rules specifically
that "in all cases, this is done by an Order to Amend...."

As to you second point, the last paragraph of Rule 1793/0 reads:

      Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Order, the purpose of which is
      to affect the operation of a prior Order, is as valid as any
      other Order, and is said to be directed at the prior Order it
      affects.

I take back what I said-- Rule 1799 does say such amendments can only
be made by an Order.  Fortunatly you placed a conditional on your Order.
Only if it was legal for you to do so... Now, since all Orders are
presumtivly valid, and the Order in question has not yet been
ajudicated, at the time you attempted to issue it, it *was* illegal for
you to issue the Order.  Even if, for some reason, there was some flaw
in the formation of the Order as originally issued.  Therfore, IMO
you never issued the Order in question.

This is getting nerve-wracking.  I'll make a deal with everyone.  I
agree to take a break from this over the long weekend if everyone else
will too.

The following is my orignal Order:

"I hereby Order and command Player Swann to refrain from;
       issuing any Administrative, Judicial, Appellate or Private
       Order that is of a type that is not explicitly defined in the
       Rules.  Nor shall e issue any such Order except in such
       circumstances where Rules explicitly permit em to issue such an
       Order."

This still allowed amendments because they are a type explicitly defined
in the rules and one which you are always permitted to make.

My second Order to you:
 
"I hereby Order and command Player Swann to refrain from using words
       that are not spelled the same backwards as forwards when
       issuing any Administrative, Judicial, Appellate or Private
       Orders unless the issuing of those Orders is explicitly
       required of 'em by the Rules or by an Order issued by Player
       Macross."

works because it doesn't try to stop you from making amendments, it
only limits the words you can use to do so.

Yes, I realize my mistake in this matter.  I was under a wrong
impression when I sent my new amendments.  However, upon reflection I
believe that you never made your Order since it was not legal for you to
do so, given that the Orders I'd made were presumptivly valid until
subject to legal challenge.  At the time the were binding, even if you
were correct (which I think I dispute) in stating they were ill-formed.

If you can counter this reasoning effectively (convince me it was legal
for you to issue the order at the time) I will indeed vacate the
amendments in question-- presuming you give me leave to order the
vacation in that case :)

This is all making my brain hurt.

All I will say to this is that in my opinion the Order as amended is no
longer is an Order at all (due to requiring action and inaction) and thus
it has no presumption of validity.

Hmm, I think that may be faulty reasoning.  The whole structure of the
Order Rules leads me to believe that such an allegedly ill-formed Order
might be invalid, improper, or illegal-- but still an Order, until
proved otherwise.

I think that may be a good idea, especially if between us we can form a
legal gamestate where everyone agrees what's happening.

It takes an order to amend an order.  Are you aware of that, Swann?

That's quite possible I'll grant you.

The only real problem is that one or both of us are already guilty of
crimes, and straightening this out will likely require more crimes due
to the orders currently in place.  I believe that both your orders and
my orders are currently valid.  Thus we would have to find a way through
them without contempt by action.  Any ideas?

Rule 1799.  "[A]n Order shall not be amended, stayed, vacated, or
otherwise changed onced executed."  The previous paragraph clearly
states that the only way to amend an Order is by an Order.

I believe Swann has committed something along the lines of 30 or 40
Class C crimes, by issuing Orders to Amend prohibited by Macross'
order.

Third paragraph of Rule 1793.

      Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Order, the purpose of which is
      to affect the operation of a prior Order, is as valid as any
      other Order, and is said to be directed at the prior Order it
      affects.

I have reconsidered my offer to Swann to join forces with him. Having
previously said that I had no intention to force anyone to do anything,
I think it would be wrong for me to team up with him.  I do, however,
stand by my offer to not CFJ on any crimes he committed with his latest
amendments.  I would order him to vacate those amendments except that
I believe the amendments themselves make it a crime for me to do so.
I'm open to arguments that that is not the case.

Sorry Swann.

Actually, I'm sorta wondering when the Orders will get as large
as the Ruleset itself. Maybe you could include provisions in them
letting other Players amend them under carefully controlled 
conditions, you could start a new Nomic then. ;)

That is, again, an incorrect interpretation of the 'presumption of 
validity' clause. Macross believed your Order enjoing him to refrain 
from issuing further Orders invalid; but the reason he gave for that 
(that your own Order attempted to both require him to perform some 
action and prohibit some other action) was not founded, as we have
enough custom to the effect that ordering someone to do several
things is the same as several different orders.

But in any case, your own Order requiring Macross to refrain from
issuing other Orders cannot prevent Macross' own (potentially)
Criminal Order from being binding until a CFJ finds them invalid by 
reason of having been prohibited by your own.

Aspirin, anyone ?

Nope, it doesn't work that way. If I were to say "Macross, you will
not speak until spoken to, and you will grovel whenever I walk by",
that would not be an invalid Order by virtue of requiring both action
and inaction, but rather be interpreted as two disinct Orders. There's
massive game custom to that effect.

I second the motion... while noting that 'everyone else' is *already* 
taking a break from all this; you and Macross are the only ones 
playing the game so far (with the possible exception of Chaos'
initial volley). But you'll have to have some consideration for
the Courts, who will sooner or later have to make sense of this
tangled mess.
