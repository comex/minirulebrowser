Can this be done without making it possible to spend more VTs than you
own? If so, then I'll support this also.

What have you got against P-notes? I admit that they are not working at
the moment, but I they are part of the (slow) project to establish an
economy around here, which is more than just a "fun bit" in my opinion.

In my view the votes will be legal, but you are in violation of R1729
for voting in Public on an Insane Proposal. Since the violation is
clearly intentional and strategic, I think you can expect to be prosecuted
to the full extent of the law for this.

I think if you were completely honest, you would admit that the Proposal
is not nearly as confusing as you are now pretending it to be for the
sake of saving face. It seems pretty clear to me. Why not just admit
that you made a mistake? We all do it.

One week is not long enough to ascertain whether a Report should be
regarded as undisputed, in my opinion. I would regard 2 weeks as an
absolute minimum, and 3 weeks as preferable. Bring back R1687!

On the other hand, it makes determining who has voted incredibly
complicated. You might not know for weeks whether Quorum has been
met. Unless you intend Players to be able to vote without paying,
which defeats the purpose of introducing pay-for-voting in the first
place. I do not support this idea.

I think it's a great shame that the infection of R1598 seems likely
to result in the repeal of the Virus. I think it's a gross
overreaction which will achieve none of the things its proponents
have claimed for it.  We shall be the poorer for its absence and gain
nothing in compensation. The proper response, in my view, would
simply have been (and still is) to upmutate R1598 to Power = 1.5 or 2.

IMHO the Proposal works as designed, but the wording is somewhat 
confusing. I'm not sure whether that deserves a -2 Style penalty, 
though.

I will almost certainly fail to perform my duties as Assessor until
the Monday after Christmas.  I have too much Real World work to do
today, and I'm going on holiday tomorrow morning for a week. 

If there was anyone willing and able to do the job, I would delegate
it to them with pleasure.

Michael.

Three weeks is far too long; two I could just about cope with.

??  I don't understand you.

It is the case that I do intend that Players should be able to vote
without having the werewithal to do so.  If they want to risk the PO
and Persistent Indebtedness situation, then let them.  I don't see why
there is a problem with determining who has voted.  Those people who
have written to the Assessor (the PF given Public Voting) have voted,
and they're billed for the privilege.  This seems simpler to me, and I
really don't see the problem with allowing people to risk debt.  This
way we can relieve the Assessor of having to both track a frequently
used currency and deal with assessing Proposals' success or failure.

The Voters seem to disagree with you.  The fact that no-one is willing
to do the Assessor's job, easily the most important in the game, is a
good indication that the system needs reform.  Eliminating the FM and
the Virus will go some way towards giving the Assessor a more stable
platform on which to work.

Between them the random elements in the game have effectively stymied
people's own efforts to make improvements to the game (Proposals
failing becuase of a messed up system; Proposals not even being made
because of a perception that things need to settle down first).  It
seems to me that lurching from crisis to crisis can come to lose its
appeal, particularly when those crises don't have any original or
creative thought behind them but are the misbegotten progeny of dice.
Let's try and mess the game up ourselves with creative work without
taking the shotgun approach of blowing bits out of the game at random.

Michael.

I hereby call for Appeal of the Dismissal of CFJ 1074. The Judge could
very well have decided truth or falsity of the Statement, and in fact he
did do so. He was just afraid that his Judgement could be explained in
another way than he intended. That does not mean he should dismiss it,
just that he should explain his Judgement well. Dismissing the CFJ is
just chickening out, and illegal too.

I'm split on this one.  On the one hand, the statement was a hypothetical,
and there was not enough information in the hypothetical to determine
if it was TRUE or FALSE.  On the other hand, Judges have in the
past taken Statements not-quite-literally, and expanded on their
interpretation of what the Statement really means in their
Judgement--in this way, the Judge could have judged TRUE or FALSE.

For example, if a CFJ were called on the Statement, "A Player who
goes on hold receives 3 VTs," I think the Judge would not be out
of line to intepret that to mean "A Player who goes on hold receives
3 VTs *for going on hold*."  On the other hand, I think it a bit
dangerous to set the precedent of requiring this sort of interpolation
of Judges.

The statute of limitations on challenges is clearly different for
different types of reports.  The Assessor's Report I think justifies a

As I previously stated, there is no reason why we should have to
upmutate the bulk of our Rules to a Power greater than 1 merely to
protect them from the maurauding Virus.  Doing so makes it that much
harder to effectuate deliberate change, which is something that, in my
opinion, be impaired, especially not for such a frivilous reason.

I do not require of the Judge to make the interpolation. I just require
of em to choose whether or not to do so.

Um, what?  If e doesn't make the interpolation, then there is not
enough information to determine whether the statement is TRUE or
FALSE ("it depends"), and e was correct to dismiss it.

While this would allow people to cast Votes with VTs they don't yet
have, I am not all that bothered by that.  (It also lets us repeal
Implicit Transfer Orders, which are a terrible kludge.)

Because it makes no logical sense for an entity to possess a negative

I will thank you to not accuse me of pretending to claim things.  It
_is_ confusing, or I would not have been so confused about its import
on first, second, and third readings.

I only refrain from imposing a Kudo transfer in the interest of
avoiding (or furthering) a Kudo war.  I consider accusations such as
the above in extremely poor taste, especially when aired publically.

Oh, good.  I'll be most interested to find out what the penalty for
"bending" a Rule is.  Is this within the scope of Rule 754?  I don't

While I agree about the Virus and the FM (unfortunately, the Virus
appears to have gotten a reprieve, because Michael's 3 Votes FOR must
be discarded, as he is not a Frankenstein Monster), I see no reason to
discard P-Notes.  P-Notes have gotten short shrift because the Game

chance to use them.

First let's get rid of the Huns (the Virus and the Frankenstein
Monster); then we can work on structural issues.

Unnecessarily insulting.

I explicitly did choose not to do so.  Didn't you read the dismissal?

I am convinced that this is the correct way to handle incomplete
hypotheticals. This may not have been done in the past for various reasons,
but I'm willing to take some heat to establish a new way.  Andre seems to
think that judging FALSE would have been correct and less "chicken."

Another possibility is to penalize Players who fail to pay Voting
bills by a suspension of Voting privileges for, say, two weeks,
beginning with the week following.  This gives the Assessor ample time
to account for the penalty.  A two-week suspension of Voting
privileges is a hefty penalty, and should be sufficient to discourage
debt voting.

Has anyone Nominated in the Election for Assessor?  I am not, but I
will agree to hold the Office temporarily until either the FM and
Virus are dead, or someone else accepts it, but my patience will wear
thin if neither of these happens quickly.  (Be thankful I didn't
deregister; in that case I could easily have refused to provide my
records, making it nearly impossible to recover the Game State.  Annoy
vital Officers at your peril.)

Agreed.  Pragmatic Currencies caused a lot of trouble, but it was
honest trouble.  We'd be done with it if it wasn't for the Virus and
FM constantly mucking around with Voting, which is the only way we
have to repair problems.

The FM also poses some very serious error correction problems, because
the FM selection process is highly prone to error, and any error can
cause horrendous cascading effect.  I note that some Players seem to
enjoy these sorts of effects; however, they are not the ones who have
to figure out what those effects _are_.  Perhaps Oerjan would like to
be Assessor for a while?  Swann?  As the primary architects of the
present crisis, I think you two are the obvious candidates for solving
it.  Well?

(Excuse my bitterness.  The Office of Assessor has been held by a very
small subset of the Electorate over its existence, and as one of that
elite group, I get very incensed at people who fail to recognize the
amount of work and dedication to the Game that that Office demands,
and who make more work, especially unnecessary or pointless work, for
the Assessor through their lack of appreciation.)

Why? What does it depend on? The Statement to Judge is "A Proposer of 
a Disinterested Proposal is not liable for a 1 P-note fee if their 
proposal fails." If some Proposers are liable for such a fee, and others,
or the same in different circumstances are not, then this Statement is
FALSE, isn't it?

Well, in that case you could have said: "There are situations in which
the Proposer of a Disinterested Proposal is liable for a 1 P-note fee, so
this is FALSE." Why didn't you do that? From your dismissal I see that the
reason you did not do so was something like: "This could be misunderstood."
That's not a valid reason for dismissal, nor do I want it to be.

My opinion is that an incomplete hypothetical like this contains an
implicit universal quantifier.

I can't refrain from adding that Steve's suddenly taking the high
moral ground on this issue as well as that of my response to the
situation created by Rule 1729, not the best written Rule we've
seen, to put it mildly, and one that he himself authored, certainly
puts him next in line as a Kudo victim when I'll need one. And I
won't mention matters of taste. ;)

Game Custom based on long-repealed Rules, I might add, and a Game
Custom that I, personally, have never liked.  I see no reason to

There is some merit here, but I'm not sure there's enough to justify
an appeal, especially since I would be one of the three Justices to
hear the appeal.  Furthermore, I don't think that overturning the
dismissal and replacing it with a finding of FALSE will work any
substantial justice, and therefore elect to refrain for calling for an
appeal.

I had to chuckle at Steve's reference to R1023 as "low Number and high Power." 
 When a rule numbered over 1000 is referred to as a low number, you know 
you're dealing with a long-running Nomic!

Let me get this straight - you're saying that even if the Rules mandate
that
an entity should possess a negative quantity of something, we should
just
ignore the Rules if that doesn't 'make sense' ? This would seem to be a
rather more radical departure from game custom than your reply suggests.

I would say that it doesn't make sense, in the context of Pragmatic
Currencies,
for the Rules to mandate that an entity should possess a negative number
of
a Currency, in part because the language in whatever Rule it is that
says you
can only execute a TO if you have 'enough of' the Currency you want to
transfer
implies that we're not dealing with negative quantities.

But negative quantities of something, per se, are a familiar
abstraction, and it's
not uncommon to use the term 'possess' loosely, i.e. 'possess negative
X' to
mean 'lack X'. It's only when whatever entity X refers to is tradable
that this
causes a problem, because of the conflation between quantities possessed
and
quantities traded. For instance, if Stylishness were framed in terms of
possessing
a quantity of Style Points, it wouldn't seem odd to say, "I have -2 SPs
now",
but it would be necessary to guard against constructions such as "I
transfer -2
SPs to Morendil". Which just about summarizes the pre-P/C situation and
the
benefit that P/C offers.

However, we do not require or expect the Rules to make consistent sense,
and
I see no compelling reason why a Rule could not mandate that an entity
should
possess a negative quantity of some Currency. I'd look on this more as a
further
(and hopefully final) problem to deal with.
