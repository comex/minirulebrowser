'Except insofar as the Rules are part of the Game State'?? As far as
I'm concerned, and I would have thought that I am not alone in this,
the texts of the Rules are probably the single most important element
of the Game State. Your claim that amendments to the Rules do not
modify the Game State is one of the more astonishing claims I have
seen made here, and constitutes, I think, a more spectacular
reductio ad absurdum of your position than I would have thought
possible.

I'd probably be more inclined to argue that they should be surrendered
at the point when they cease to have legal significance. If I were
the Banker and VTs had been 'destroyed' in the above sense, I'd
probably collect all the poker chips formerly in play and put them
away, since they're no longer granted legal recoginition by the
Rules.  But say I hadn't done that, and the chips were still lying
around. Then there'd be no stopping us from passing a Rule saying
that the chips should regain their significance and maintain their
former distribution. Well, in fact, there'd be nothing to stop us
from passing such a Rule even if all the chips had been collected and
put away. But I'd want the Proposal to be explicit about the fact
that it was acting that way. In the case of a Proposal that just says
that poker chips are once again to be used to represent VTs, the
situation is much less clear. It's pretty clear for instance, that
during the 5 minute interval, the answer to any question of the form
"does Player X have any VTs?" is going to be "no".  If, after we pass
the Proposal to rerecognize chips as VTs, Player X has 5 VTs again,
we migth want to ask where those VTs came from, since by stipulation
no Rule actually said or implied that Player X gained any VTs during
the interval.

I tend to think that Scott erred in not interpreting Harlequin's
transfers as Harlequin intended them to be interpreted, particularly
in light of the Appeal Judgement of CFJ 940, in which Scott's own
arguments seem to support that view.

Saying "I hereby transfers 4 VTs to the Bank for the purposes of
satisfying Transfers Orders X and Y", when both TOs are known to
be for 2 VTs each, seems to me to be a sufficiently unambiguous way
of making two Payment Orders.

So I think Scott probably was wrong to deny the COE.

Hm. Doesn't that just give you the first Proposal *passed* in each

Of course, since all the Black Repeals were held not to have occurred,
and it took a month for the game to recover from the shock. Similarly
if less dramatically, it looks as though history will show that no
Proposals passed in August or September of 1997.

It might be interesting to get a Court ruling on what constitutes
permanent as opposed to merely temporary inability to receive the PF,
or at least to establish some precedents with regards to specific
cases.

I can also inform the citizenry that Kolja is not currently
subscribed to agora-discussion.

While Rule 478 does say that "The temporary inability of a Player to
receive a Public Forum does not deprive that medium of any legal
significance as a Public Forum", it does _not_ say anywhere that permanent
inability does.  I don't see any reason why it does - and I think the
quoted sentence is just a redundant clarification. 

Also, I don't see any reason why we should want something do stop being a
PF automatically in this reason. 

The thing I do find somewhat bothersome, in theory, is that there is
nothing prohibiting the person in charge of a PF from simply removing
other Players. But this has little to do with temporary vs. permanent
inability.

I suggest, if anything, that we remove the phrase "temporary" from the
Rule, and instead prohibit Players from removing others from a PF without
their consent. 

Greetings,
Ørjan.

Yes. But that is not important when you average over periods much longer
than a month.

The only reason to list something approximating months in the first place
was to find out where the Chromatic Repeals were, so they could be
corrected for. Otherwise I could just have used the largest and smallest
Proposal numbers in the Ruleset, subtracted, and divided by the time in
between.

Well, if they are separate Injunctions these are separate Appeal Judgements,
and so we get separate Judicial Salaries. I promise to divide them among
the Agoran public.

I regarded them as more, as Morendil spcifically wrote "I issue Injunctions"
four times. Although in that case I don't know the specific number - the last
one is only one if we regard it as one for each Officer. And if we regard it
as one for each player, the total number becomes truly astronomic...

To me the main difference is between direct and indirect effects - when
a Proposal is adopted, first all its direct effects take place, only then
the indirect effect get a chance to do what they should do. Any indirect
change is only the effect of the effects of the Proposal taking effect,
the direct changes are the effect of the effects of the Proposal taking
effect, so it does not seem illogical that the second take place after all
of the first.

I would say CFJ 2000 is relevant assuming CFJ 1 is relevant.
CFJ 2001 is not relevant.
CFJ 2002 is not relevant.

Because 2001 & 2002 have nothing to do with the rules at all.

Here is a puzzle: Let's say we wanted to ban the use of that word in all
discussion and official documents. What would be the most elegant way
of doing so? (Barring extra-game mechanics, of course).

I probably agree with you, but I have a suspicion that Chuck's idea
is this: CFJ 2001 is relevant because it concerns how we ascertain
the relevance of Statements to the Rules. But if that's right, then
Chuck can argue that CFJ 2001 just lays the structure of CFJ 2002 bare.
So we ought to regard CFJ 2002 as relevant also. Am I getting close to
the mark, Chuck?

Why not one for each Player? The last Injunction especially seems to
imply that reading.

"The word formed by the concatenation of the strings 'sub' and
'scribe'" is an adequate definite description, in my opinion.

Your challenge needs a little refinement. You should make it explicit
that the effect is to be the banning of that word and *only* that
word. Although it has to be said that attempted solutions which
simply banned all communication completely, or all use of the letter
's', would hardly count as elegant.

I can think of several ways to do it, but none of them are particularly
elegant. 

1. No Player shall use the letters 's', 'u', 'b', 's', 'c', 'r', 'i',
'b', 'e' in that order in a word in any message whatsoever.

There's another problem with this: 'any message whatsoever' is stronger
thsn your puzzle demands. It's easy to distinguish PF from non-PF posts,
but how to pick out all and only those messages relating to Agora? But
really that's not the point, is it? The point, surely, is to pick out
those messages handled my Majordomo. So, what about, "in any message
to a Public Forum, or to <agora-discussion@gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au>"? 

2. No Player shall use the word 's-bscribe', except with the hyphen
replaced by a 'u', in any message to a Public Forum, or to
<agora-discussion@gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au>.

3. No Player shall use the word which backwards reads 'ebircsbus'
in any message...

4. No Player shall use the word which is the nth definition on
page p of dictionary d (give values for the triple <n,p,d> as
appropriate) in any message...

The above are all syntantic solutions. We could also try semantic
solutions: 

5. No Player shall use the word whose French translation is <blah> 
(Vanyel?) in any message... or whose Latin translation is <blah>
(Oerjan?) in any message...

6. No Player shall use the word which the Majordomo software attempts
to interpret as a request to add an address to one of its mailing
lists, in any message...

I think once you admit that the game state actually was, at some point
or in some sense, such that VTs did not have a Mintor, then you run
into the problem that R101 states that Players must *always* abide by
the Rules then in effect. What justification is there in the Rules
for suspending the effect of the Rules until all the direct effects
of a Proposal have taken effect? I think Michael was right to see
that the only way to resist the Judgement of CFJ 933 was to argue
that the game state never was such that VTs did not have a Mintor.
The version of the atomic view he defended has that consequence, and
could have been used to justify overturning the Judgement, had not
game custom been against it.

This might very well be FALSE for the mere technicality that Elde is no
longer a Player. :-)

I believe that the argument made by Vir in his appelate Judgement of
CFJ 933 also mandates the destruction of all P-Notes and Indulgences,
since the Mintor of these Currencies was also destroyed when Rule 1470
was amended.  Note that this occurs before Rule 1579 was amended so as
to leave P-Notes and Indulgences without defined Mintors; thus,
all P-Notes and Indulgences necessarily ceased to exist.

Ooo. Read that again, and tell me it's not ambiguous. It took me a minute 
to see what you meant.

Here's some syntactic groupings to clarify. You meant:

2. No Player shall use the word ('s-bscribe', except with the hyphen
replaced by a 'u')...

But I read:

2. [(No Player shall use the word 's-bscribe'), except with the hyphen
replaced by a 'u']...

You see?

If e is no longer a Player, then the point is moot :)
