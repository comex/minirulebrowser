Does anyone else think we should break the link between Attribution
and Interestedness? Proposal 3527 may have been Disinterested, but
I don't think Oerjan should therefore go unacknowledged as the 
Originator and Author of the very witty R1729.

Well, I don't know what to do now. I've had to turn filter off because
I wasn't receiving any mail. Right now, I have no mail handling at all;
it's all just landing in my inbox on /var/spool/mail, unsorted, which
is annoying. Ideas from you mail wizards would be appreicated.

Twice now in the last month, some weirdness in the way procmail works
which I haven't been able to track down (the procmailrc I use is
really very simple) has actually crashed the machine where my account
is, not to mention losing me a heap of mail. The first time it
happened, a machine crash seems to have caught procmail by surprise,
and it failed to clean up after itself, leaving a .lockmail file in
my home directory. Thereafter, each piece of incoming mail spawned a
new procmail process which couldn't complete itself becuase it was
waiting for the lock to be removed. Since I get a lot of mail. it
didn't take long for me to exceed maxprocesses.  Shortly after that,
the machine crashed again. Bad.

I'm not quite sure what happened this time, but the net result was the
same. I lost a heap of mail. Sigh.

I think this Claim should be admitted, and a Correction published,
but that duty I believe will now fall to the new Assessor, General
Chaos. See R1585 (Power=2, note).

He won't.  Only unattributed *amendments* fail to cause the
proposer to be an author.  (Odd that *all* Rule Changes resulting
from disinterested proposals are unattributed, but any non-Amendment
unattributed Rule changes have no real effect due to being
unattributed.)

I agree.  Maybe it should be unattributed only if disinterested *and* not
substantial.
