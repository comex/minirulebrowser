Protoproposal Chaos228 [rev. 3]

Simpler Changing of the Voting Tariff

Be it resolved, that Rule 1682 be amended to read:

|     The Voting Tariff is a number of VTs, a multiple of the MUQ for
|     VTs, between 0 and 2 inclusive.  The Assessor may set the Voting
|     Tariff to any value in this range at any time by announcing the
|     change in the Public Forum; the change takes effect 72 hours
|     after it is announced.  Until the Assessor sets another value,

I argue that Vlad's "Proposal" lacks a "clear indication" that it is
"intended to become a Proposal".  It is clearly marked as an
"example", and I am of the belief than an example Proposal is not an
actual Proposal.

In any case, your objection will avoid any unnecessary complications
should I be found to be in error.

      (a) The published Report of an Officer, with respect to those
          matters reported therein which that Officer is required by
          law to report, shall be determinative evidence of the facts
          therein presented, in the absence of clear and convincing
          evidence contrary to those facts.

      (b) No challenge to the published Report of an Officer, with
          respect to those matters reported therein which that Officer
          is required by law to report, shall proceed unless:

            report; or
        (2) credible evidence that the Officer acted in bad faith, or
            acted in good faith upon information presented to em in
            bad faith, is presented.

      (c) For the purpose of this Rule, the Speaker shall be
          considered an Officer.
