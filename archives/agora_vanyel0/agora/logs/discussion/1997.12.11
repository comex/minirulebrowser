I must just be a miserly bastard.

I suggest that if you feel someone has done something "to be of
benefit of the Agora community" etc, then you should recommend the
Player to me, and I will consider it.

Now, here's an interesting thought - Rule 1729 is not at all clear
that the prohibition on "discussing v*tes" or "v*ting in Public"
applies *only* to the Insane Proposal. It seems perfectly possible to 
read it as prohibiting any Public V*ting or discussion of v*tes...

Not at all.  All I've done is caused Rule 1729 to be "bended".  Big
deal.  There is no penalty for bending Rules, none that I am aware of.

So 3543 passed. Unless I'm very wrong, that would seem to mean that
Indulgence lotteries must now be held for any previous weeks since the
adoption of 3543 in which they weren't held.

I think you are correct.  But it also means that the 17 Indulgences created by
the Chancellor were distributed according to the wrong method.  I'm not sure
how this should be resolved, CFJ?  Any thoughts?

No need for a CFJ.  You should (and are, in fact, required to) vacate
those Payment Orders and institute new ones according to the correct
Rule.

Protoproposal Chaos20 [rev. 1]

Loophole Avoidance

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1741 be amended, by appending to
it the paragraph:

      However, this Rule shall not apply to a Proposal if it would
      have the effect of prohibiting all Voting upon that Proposal.

FWIW, I believe the Ordinances changed at 2 Dec 1997 11:40:13 +1100, upon
Blob's consent to Threat Proposition 27.

Indulgence Distribution

I quote from R1734:

      A Player only has the authority to vacate a Payment Order if e
      is the Player who originally executed that Order, if e is
      required to vacate that Order by the Rules or by an Injunction,
      or if the Rules otherwise grant em the authority to vacate that
      Order.

and from R1599:

      If a Player who is required to execute a Payment Order executes
      it and then subsequently vacates it, e is still required to
      execute that Order, as if e had never executed it.


It seems I have the same problem vacating those 17 Indulgence Payment Orders as
before.  If I vacate them, I have to re-execute them.  It might, indeed, be
better for a CFJ to be issued and let the Judge issue an Injunction to vacate
these payments.  If there is no objection (or someone wants to take over the
Heraldship again long enough to do this), I will go ahead an issue this CFJ
tomorrow sometime.  I will, of course, provide the lucky judge with whatever
information e requires to easily issue the Injunction.

The illegal (despite what it says, in most countries including the USA,
Canada and Norway - I assume Australia and Great Britain are no
exceptions) chain letter partially included below was apparently sent to
me through gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au from easynet.co.uk.

I suggest that you take appropriate action against this user according to
your acceptable use policy.

If you are being used as a mail relay between unknown third parties (to
avoid mail blocks set up between those parties) I would suggest that you
modify your email system to disallow such relaying.

If you are a dialup provider, you may consider removing direct TCP port 25
(SMTP) access to arbitrary hosts.

For more information see the US Postal Inspection Service's chain letter
page at <http://www.usps.gov/websites/depart/inspect/chainlet.htm>, which
will debunk virtually every claim made in the letter: that it is legal (in
the US), that it works, etc. etc.

Sincerely,
Oerjan Johansen.

Only if the Rules really did require you to execute them in the first
place. But it is being claimed that they did not, and that different POs
were required by the Rules instead.

This may have been fixed by Proposal 3604.

Re: Indulgence Distribution

Another thing I need cleared up.  Should the backlog of distributions be made
using Player eligibility from the original week's list, or from the current
eligibility list?  The Rule is not specific - it just says "among all Players",
which makes me think I am safe in distributing them among all Players at the
time of distribution.  Anyone object to this?

Also, here is the list of intended distributions by week, starting with Aug 18.
If anyone cares to check, let me know if you see an error.  I'm assuming a
negative number means no Indulgences distributed for that week.  Anyone care to
argue for the nastier interpretation?  8)

Looks like there will be plenty of Indulgences floating around.

I would tend to think that you should use the Players as they existed
at the start of the given Nomic Week.

You will note that Rule 1712 was amended by Proposal 3618 to fix that
problem.

David> Looks like there will be plenty of Indulgences floating around.

Indeed.  I get 258, or about 17 for each current Player.  Of course,
using the Players as they existed at the start of each Nomic Week will
result in some of them going to deregistered Players and thus getting
tied up in Probate, or immediately repatriated.  I can provide a list
of the Players registered at the start of each Nomic Week, if you
like.

Because you were not required to execute them (they were executed
wrongly, in fact), Rule 1599 does not apply.

R1729 does say that "For such a Proposal...there shall be no discussing
votes." That's clear enough for me.

However, I also note this from R1023 (Power = 2):

      Activity of a purely discussionary nature is excluded from the
      ordering requirement, and may be conducted at any time.

I disagree. We have well established game custom to the contrary, from
the way late distributions of the Powers were handled. I think you
should use the current list of Active Player. You are performing

This applies only to ASAP -- i.e., if someone is required to perform
an "activity of a purely discussionary nature" they are allowed to
perform it "out of order" with regard to other ASAP activities.

The provision appears, it is true, in the ASAP Rule. But that is no
reason to deny its wider applicability. The provision seems to me
to say quite clearly, and with the force of low Number and high Power,
that activity of a purely discussionary nature may be conducted at
any time. That has to be a relevant consideration in any debate in
which one party is claiming that certain kinds of discussionary
activity are prohibited.

I don't think you can in any case. R683:

      A Vote is legally cast if it is cast during the Voting Period
      of that Proposal...

That doesn't say anything about declarations of Presence, though. On
the other hand, R1715 only makes declarations of Presence efficacious
for the purposes calculating Quorum if they are made during the VP.
So, although as far as I can see, you could declare Presence now on
Proposal 4000-10000, the Assessor could for all and intents and purposes
just ignore your having done so. As long, that is, as the Rules don't
change...:) (There's also the fact that you have to send DoPs to the
Vote Collector - and you don't know yet who that's going to be for
Proposals 4000-10000.)

Even if R1023 did not guarantee the permissibility of discussion,
which I believe it does (in any case, the matter is now before the
Courts), I doubt that Scott's remark constitutes 'discussing Votes'.
Exactly what does constitute discussing Votes is far from clear, but
as a rough guess, I'd say that it includes discussing the Votes of
particular Players, or discussing one's voting intentions or the
intentions of other Players, but excludes general remarks about the
Rules. An interesting question for the Courts to rule on.

Normally, I would agree.  However, look closely at the wording:

      At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Herald shall randomly 
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      distribute a number of Indulgences equal to the number of 
      Blots executed in the past Week, minus the number of Blots 
      vacated in the past Week, among all Players: for each such 
                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      Indulgence, the Herald shall randomly select one Player and 
      issue a Payment Order from the Bank to that Player for one
      Indulgence.

This is not like a CFJ, where the selection is made as soon as
possible; the Rule requires the distribution take place at the
beginning of each Nomic Week.  Hence, I believe that each week's
distribution should be based on the conditions extant at the beginning
of that week.

I also believe that my interpretation has the benefit of consistency:
to be consistent, you should also argue that the number of Indulgences
distributed should be based on the total POs executed (less vacated)
in the week preceding the distribution.  This is not what Crito plans,
and I cannot imagine this interpretation being accepted as proper.

Hm, it seems to me that this rule states quite clearly that

I must disagree with this. The context says to me quite clearly that this
applies only with regard to ASAP ordering. (I don't mean only its presence
in the ASAP rule -- that is probably irrelevant.) I see the second clause
of the sentence only serving to restate the first: any discussionary
activity may be performed at any time, regardless of ASAP requirements. If
they were separate sentences, I could at least see your point, but as it is
it seems quite weak to me.

There is also, of course, the argument that "can be conducted at any time"
does not neccesarily contradict the Insanity Rule, speaking as it does only
of timing issues, not of the legality of such discussion.

I believe that the middle portion of this sentence (snipped in the above
