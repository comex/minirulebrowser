Protoproposal Chaos56 [rev. 20]

Currencies

Be it resolved, that Rule 1721 be amended to read:

      There shall exist the Office of Chancellor.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1467 be amended to read:

      (a) A Currency is any medium of exchange which has been
          designated as a Currency in accordance with the Rules.

      (b) The designation of a medium of exchange as a Currency, and
          the cancellation of such designation, may be accomplished
          only by:
        (1) the operation of an Instrument with Power 1 or greater;
        (2) the Chancellor, Without Objection; or
        (3) Judicial Order, whenever the Rules so permit.

      (c) For the purposes of the Rules, units of a Currency are
          fungible and indivisible.

      (d) A Currency may be denominated such that a fraction of its
          primary denomination is its smallest indivisible unit, so
          long as there is a smallest indivisible unit.  When no other
          specification exists, the smallest indivisible unit of a
          Currency shall be one unit of its smallest denomination. 
          Amounts less than this smallest indivisible unit may be used
          in intermediate calculations; all such calculations shall be
          rounded off at the point that they are reduced to transfers,
          orders to transfer, or other finalized results of legal
          import.

      (e) The Chancellor shall retain and publish at least monthly a
          schedule, listing every medium of exchange designated as a
          Currency under this Rule.  This schedule shall include
          whatever information the Chancellor deems necessary, but at
          least the following information for each Currency:
        (1) the designated denomination or denominations of that
            Currency (and if more than one, the relationship between
            them);
        (2) the fraction of the smallest denomination of that Currency
            which is its smallest indivisible unit;
        (3) that Currency's Recordkeepor; and,
        (4) the Mintor or Mintors of that Currency, if any.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) The "Recordkeeper" of a Currency refers to the entity who
          has agreed to maintain a record of the ownership of the
          units of that Currency.  The Recordkeepor of an Currency is
          subject to the jurisdiction of these Rules.  Specifically, e
          shall:
        (1) maintain the abovementioned records in a manner consistent
            with these Rules, including the timely recordation of
            transfers of ownership made consistent with the Rules;
        (2) comply in a timely manner to all requests to produce those
            records as required by the Rules; and
        (3) perform all other duties which the Rules impose upon the
            Recordkeepor of a Currency.

      (b) A Currency may have any number of designated Mintors.  A
          Mintor may be designated for a Currency, or such designated
          cancelled, by:
        (1) the operation of an Instrument with Power 1 or greater; or
        (2) the Chancellor, Without Objection.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1598 be amended to read:

      Units of a Currency are transferred only when the Recordkeepor
      of that Currency receives a notice from the owner of one or more
      units of that Currency, specifying the units to be transferred
      and the entity who is to owner the units thus transferred.  The
      entity receiving the units thus transferred becomes their owner,
      and the Recordkeepor shall so note this on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1471 be amended to read:

      Units of a Currency are created only when the Recordkeepor of
      that Currency receives a notice from a designated Mintor of that
      Currency, specifying the number of units to be created and the
      entity who is to own the units so created.  The specified entity
      owns the units so created, and the Recordkeepor shall so note
      this on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      Units of a Currency are destroyed only when the Recordkeepor of
      that Currency receives a notice from the owner of one or more
      units of that Currency, specifying the units to be destroyed. 
      The Recordkeepor shall note this destruction on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1596 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever an entity becomes indebted to another for some
          amount of Currency, that entity indebted is required to
          transfer that amount of Currency to the entity indebted to
          within seven days.

      (b) A debt not paid within seven days is overdue.  Any entity to
          whom an overdue debt is due may assess a late penalty of not
          more than 25% of the overdue debt, and may do so repeatedly,
          not more than once every seven days after the debt becomes
          overdue.  Late penalties are added to the overdue debt.  An
          entity may elect to charge smaller late penalties, charge
          them less frequently, or forego late penalties altogether,
          at that entity's sole discretion.

      (c) If the validity of a debt, or any part thereof, is disputed
          by a Call for Judgement, that debt (or portion thereof) is
          not considered overdue, and does not accrue late penalties,
          while the dispute remains unsettled.

      (d) When an entity transfers units of Currency to another entity
          for the purpose of making a payment on debt, the receiving
          entity shall apply that payment to the nondisputed debts
          owed to em by the transferring entity, in order from oldest
          to newest.  A debt is paid when a transfer has been applied
          to it in this manner.  Any surplus may be returned to the
          transferring entity, or may be retained by the receiving
          entity to be applied to future debts.  Any amount retained
          by a receiving entity in this manner shall be returned upon
          demand.

      (e) An entity may assume that any Currencies transferred to it
          to be payments on debts due to em, unless the transferree
          clearly indicates otherwise when making the transfer.

      (f) An entity who is owed an overdue debt may issue an Order
          requiring the entity who owes that debt to make payment by
          requiring a transfer of any amount up to the amount of the
          debt due, but only if no other Order currently in force
          requires the same entity to make payment on that same debt
          or any part thereof.  Such an Order shall be stayed (by the
          Clerk of the Courts) if the debt in question is subsequently
          disputed, and vacated (by the Judge) if it is found that the
          debt upon which the Order is based is invalid.

      (g) An entity who is owed a debt may cancel all or part of that
          debt at any time.

      (h) A Judge may enjoin the assessment of late penalties,
          restrict the amount of late penalties, or require the
          reduction or cancellation of a debt, by Judicial Order, when
          the Rules specifically so allow.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1479 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever a Rule calls for an Officer to pay out some
          quantity of Currency to some entity, that Officer shall
          execute a Notice of Debt for the given amount with that
          entity as payee and the Bank as payor.

      (b) Whenever a Rule calls for an Officer to bill an entity for
          some quantity of Currency, that Officer shall execute a
          Notice of Debt for the given amount with that entity as
          payor and the Bank as payee.

      (c) A Notice of Debt is executed by announcing in the Public
          Forum that the payor is indebted to the payee for the amount
          indicated, so long as the announcement sets for the reason
          therefore.

      (d) The lawful execution of a Notice of Debt causes the payor
          noted therein to be indebted to the payee noted therein for
          the amount noted therein, but only if the executor of the
          Notice of Debt was authorized to execute it, and the reason
          set forth therein is correct.

      (e) The duties required of Officers by this Rule shall be
          performed as soon as possible after they arise.

      (f) For the purposes of this Rule, the Speaker shall be
          considered an Officer.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1817 be amended to read:

      (a) The Recordkeepor of a Currency is required to record every
          transfer for which e receives a transfer notice denominated
          in the Currency of which e is the recordkeepor, when:
        (1) the notice was sent by the transferring entity's Executor,
            or, for an entity which lacks an Executor, by any other
            person empowered by the Rules to execute transfers on the
            behalf of the transferring entity;
        (2) the notice clearly sets forth the quantity to be
            transferred in a form such that the Recordkeepor can
            easily and definitively determine the amount being
            transferred;
        (3) the entity to receive the transfer is specified with
            sufficient clarity that a reasonable person in the
            Recordkeepor's position would know to which entity the
            transferring entity refers; and
        (4) the transfer is for an amount not more than the current
            holdings of the transferring entity.

      (b) Transfers shall be noted on the Recordkeepor's records in
          the order in which they are received by the Recordkeepor.

      (c) When a Recordkeepor records a transfer, e shall promptly
          inform the recipient of the transfer that the transfer has
          been recorded, unless it appears to the Recordkeepor that
          the recipient is already aware of the transfer.

      (d) When a Recordkeepor elects not to record a transfer for the
          reason that the transfer is not in conformance with any part
          of subdivision (a) of this Rule, e shall promptly inform
          both the transferrer and the recipient that the transfer has
          not be recorded, and give the reason therefor.  (If the
          reason for failure to record is that the recipient was not
          clearly specified, there is no duty to inform the
          recipient.)

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1696 be amended to read:

      (a) Voting Tokens are hereby designated as a Currency.  The sole
          designated Mintor of Voting Tokens is the Bank.  The
          Recordkeepor of Voting Tokens is irrevocably designated to
          be the Accountor.  The smallest indivisible unit for this
          Currency is 0.01 Voting Token.

      (b) The Accountor agrees to act as Recordkeepor for Voting
          Tokens by accepting the Office.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1701 be amended to read:

      (a) Proposal Notes are hereby designated as a Currency.  The
          sole designated Mintor of Proposal Notes is the Bank.  The
          Recordkeepor of Proposal Notes is irrevocably designated to
          be the Promotor.

      (b) The Promotor agrees to act as Recordkeepor for Proposal
          Notes by accepting the Office.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1435 be amended to read:

      (a) Indulgences are hereby designated as a Currency.  The sole
          designated Mintor of Indulgences is the Bank.  The
          Recordkeepor of Indulgences is irrevocably designated to be
          the Herald.

      (b) The Herald agrees to act as Recordkeepor for Indulgences by
          accepting the Office.

      (c) An entity which owes a debt (or debts) to the Bank for any
          number of Indulgences is said to have that number of Blots.
          A Player has Blots equal to the sum of all such debts. Debts
          which are in dispute are still considered when determining
          how many Blots a Player has.

      (d) When a Rule states that a Player is to gain some number of
          Blots, a Notice of Debt shall be executed for the same
          number of Indulgences, naming that Player as the payor and
          the Bank as payee; this order shall be executed by whomever
          the Rules require to report the change in Blots.

      (e) A Player who has no debt in Indulgences to the Bank is
          Immaculate.

      (f) It is a Win-Preventing condition for a Player to have one or
          more Blots.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1601 be amended to read:

      (a) An entity is dissolute if it:
        (1) possesses any number of units of Currency, and
        (2) does not have an Executor.

      (b) The Notary may perform any of the following with respect to
          a dissolute entity:
        (1) transfer Currencies owned by that entity to any entity to
            which the dissolute entity owes debts, for the purpose of
            making partial or complete payment on those debts;
        (2) cancel in part or in full any debts owed to it; or
        (3) Without Objection, transfer Currencies owned by that
            entity to the Bank.

      (c) The Notary is authorized, all other Rules notwithstanding,
          to transfer Currency from any dissolute entity to any other
          entity as if e were the dissolute entity's Executor, when e
          is permitted to do so in accordance with subdivision (b) of
          this Rule.

      (d) A dissolute entity is considered to continue to have legal
          existence as long as it continues to possess units of
          Currency, even if it is dissolved, destroyed, or otherwise
          would cease to have legal existence prior to that time.  An
          entity which has legal existence solely as a result of this
          subdivision is called "terminal".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1853 be amended to read:

      (a) Taxes may be levied only when the Rules explicitly permit
          it, and then only by the Officer authorized by the Rule
          permitting the levy.

      (b) An Officer levies a tax by announcing it in a Public Forum.
          An announcement of levy must specify:
        (1) The Currency being taxed;
        (2) the amount of the levy, expressed as a percentage; and
        (3) the legal authorization for the levy.

      (c) Upon the announcement of a tax levy conforming with
          subdivision (b) of this Rule, each entity other than the
          Bank becomes liable to the Bank for a debt equal to the
          stated percentage of that entity's holdings of the Currency
          stated in the announcement.  The amount of each entity's tax
          debt shall be based on the amount of that Currency owned by
          that entity at the time the announcement was made.

      (d) The Recordkeepor of the Currency named in a tax levy shall,
          as soon as possible after the announcement, provide a report
          setting out the amount of the taxed Currency held by every
          entity which held any units of that Currency at the time the
          announcement was made.  The Recordkeepor is not required to
          compute the tax due; if e does so, eir computations do not
          have any legal force.

      (e) The amount of tax levied may not exceed 50% of an entity's
          holdings unless the Rule which authorizes the tax explicitly
          permits it.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) The Voting Bank shall exist.

      (b) The Assessor is the Executor of the Voting Bank.

      (c) The Assessor shall not (as its Executor) transfer Currencies
          out of the Voting Bank except when required to do so by the
          Rules.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1442 be amended to read:

      (a) Proposals have a voting cost, equal to the Voting Tariff at
          the time they were distributed. If there was no value set
          for the Voting Tariff at that time, then the voting cost is
          1 VT.

      (b) Each Voting Entity who votes on a Proposal is liable to a
          debt to the Voting Bank for a number of Voting Tokens equal
          to the votes cast by that entity on that proposal,
          multiplied by the voting cost of that Proposal.  This debt
          is realized when the results of the Voting on that Proposal
          are announced.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1824 be amended to read:

      (a) Any entity who, at the beginning of a given Nomic Week, is
          overdue on a debt due to the Voting Bank, commits the
          Infraction of Debt Voting.

      (b) The penalty for Debt Voting shall be a denial of Voting
          Privileges for a period of two weeks.

      (c) Debt Voting shall be reported by the Assessor.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1470 be amended to read:

      (a) The Bank shall exist.

      (b) The Chancellor shall be the Executor of the Bank.

      (c) The Chancellor shall not transfer Currencies from the Bank
          except for the purpose of making payment upon the debts of
          the Bank, or when otherwise explictly required by the Rules
          to do so.

      (d) If the Chancellor makes a transfer not permitted by
          subdivision (c) of this Rule, e commits the Class A Crime of
          Misappropriation, and upon conviction of this Crime shall be
          removed from Office.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 766 be amended, by deleting the
paragraph which reads "Each Group has Mint Authority."

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1466 be amended, by replacing the
term "Payment Order" with the term "Notice of Debt" wherever it may
appear.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1742 be amended, by deleting the
sentence which reads "When restitution would involve the transfer of
Currencies, the Judge is authorized to execute whatever Payment Orders
are necessary to effect fair and appropriate restitution." and also by
replacing the phrase "nor shall restitution include the execution of
Payment Orders, the payor of which is any entity not party to the
agreement" with "nor shall restitution include the requirement for any
entity not party to the agreement to make any transfer of Currency".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 502 be amended to read:

      (a) The Clerk of the Courts shall, within one week of the time a
          Player earns a Judicial Salary, pay out that Judicial Salary
          to that Player.

      (b) If a decision (or dismissal) which resulted in a Player

          overturned on appeal, the Clerk of the Court shall bill that
          Judge for the refund of the Judicial Salary paid to em.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1664 be amended, by replacing the

deleting the paragraph which begins "The Registrar is authorised to
vacate".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1712 be amended, by replacing "issue
a Payment order from the Bank to that Player for one Indulgence" with
"pay out one Indulgence to that Player".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1714 be amended, by replacing the
paragraph beginning "An Overdue Payment Order" with the following:

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1727 be amended, by replacing the

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that, not less than seven days prior to
      Agora's Birthday, the Chancellor shall, on behalf of the Bank,
      submit delayed Transfer Orders to be executed at 00:04:30 GMT
      +1200 on Agora's Birthday to each Player for the amount of 3 VTs
      each;

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Chancellor shall, on behalf of
      the Bank, submit Transfer Orders for one P-note each from the

      Any Order may always be amended, stayed, or vacated by the
      Player (or, in the case of Appellate Orders, Board of Appeal)
      who executed it.  Certain classes of Orders may be amended,
      stayed, or vacated in other circumstances as well, when the

      Amend, Stay, or Vacate, respectively, the original Order.

      Otherwise, an Order shall not be amended, stayed, vacated, or
      otherwise changed once executed.

Be it further resolved, that Rules 1599, 1722, 1730, 1732, 1734, 1576,
1577, 1578, 1579, 1819, 1820, 1821, 1822, 1823, 1759, 1818, 1713,
1735, 1738, 1739, 1757 and 1637 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) All units of Currency which existed at the time the Proposal
          which created this Rule was adopted shall continue to exist
          with no change in ownership, provided that the Currency in
          question is recognized as a Currency after all provisions of
          the Proposal which enacted this Rule have been implemented
          to the extent permitted by law.

      (b) Each entity which was named as the payor of a Payment Order
          executed and neither satisfied nor vacated at the time the
          Proposal which created this Rule was adopted shall owe a
          debt to the payee of each such Payment Order for the amount
          of that Payment Order and which shall be due seven days
          after the execution of that Payment Order.

Zero Payment Orders

Be it resolved, that Rule 1599 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever a Rule requires a Player to execute a Payment
          Order, e shall do so within seven days of when the
          requirement arises.

      (b) The foregoing does not apply to any requirement to execute a
          Payment Order for zero units of any Currency.  Such Payment
          Orders need not be executed, any Rule to the contrary
          notwithstanding.

Appeal Tweaks

Be it resolved, that Rule 1570 be amended to read:

      (a) As soon as possible after an Application for Appeal of a
          Judgement or Motion has been executed, the Clerk of the
          Court shall:
        (1) assign, according to the procedures defined elsewhere,
            three Players to serve as the Board of Appeal for that
            Appeal; and
        (2) publish a Notice of Appeal identifying the Judgement or
            Motion being Appealed, and the identity of the three
            Players selected under subparagraph (a)(1) above.

      (b) The Clerk of the Courts shall develop and utilize a system
          of numbering or otherwise identifying Calls for Appeals such
          that Players may readily and unambiguously refer to any
          individual Appeal without undue difficulty or confusion.

      (c) If the Clerk of the Courts is in doubt as to whether an
          Application for Appeal has been successfully executed, e
          shall proceed as if it had been successfully executed,
          reserving the question of successful execution to the Board
          of Appeals.

      (d) If the Board of Appeals finds that the Application for
          Appeal which led to the appointment of that Board was not
          successfully executed, it may (at its discretion) dismiss
          the Appeal, without making any ruling on the merits of the
          Appeal.

This is one of Michael's arguments. I'm not very fond of it. R1478
grants me, as Kolja's sole Executor, the power to act as if I were him
for certain purposes, mostly making Orders and such like. I do not think
this requires that I be identified with him completely in every respect.
In particular, I don't think this should be read as implying that my
wishes legally are Kolja's wishes for the purposes of determining
effective control.

Well, at the very least Kolja and I have succeeded in our aim of
exploring the limits of the Power of Attorney Rules. The discussion of
effective control has also been highly stimulating. I only wish I had
enough time to follow and contribute properly, as I would have done in
days gone by, before I started full-time work and living with my
partner.

This seems to be the developing consensus. Although of course the
*outcome* of the debate was not predictable, the *procedure* of using
the courts to determine the meaning of "effective control" in various
situations has worked exactly as I hoped it would when I inserted the
language into R1873, after I had given up trying to define what
effective control was exhaustively in advance.

I think this shows that the "effective control" language in R1873 is
not broken.

It does, but that doesn't help individuals in Scott's position of having
lots of VTs, but also lots of VT debts, when a tax is levied.

I just wanted to let everyone know it will be at least Friday
before I get another Ruleset posted.  I had hoped to have it done
by now (I'm about to leave on a business trip and will be incommunicado
until Friday), but I've been sick the past couple of days so I haven't
been able to.  I apoogize for the inconvenience.

By the way, what was this PO for? Tax? I could have sworn I paid Kolja's
taxes already...could you look into it?

Personally, I didn't vote for it because it was too long for me to
ascertain on my own what effects it would have, and my request for a
precis went unanswered. Since other Proposals of this length have often
had unpredictable and catastrophic consequences, I decided "better the
devil you know".

I was under the impression that I had explained the Proposal at
length.  Perhaps you weren't paying attention.

This TO fails, since VT631 is a PO for 1.2 VTs, not 1 VT.

It was for the tax.  I've looked through my archives and I can find you paying
off your own taxes, paying off Kolja's duty to vote penalties, but I can't find
any record of your paying eir taxes.  Of course, it's possible I missed it, so
if you can find a copy of the message, please send it to me and I will
update the record.

You're right.  I forgot about that fix to the accounting method.

I have to agree with you.  As executor, you are empowered to act on Kolja's
behalf.  You are not empowered to wish on his behalf.  Since your wishes are
not legally Kolja's wishes, your ability to issue transfer orders on his
behalf does not represent effective control.  Since Kolja cannot execute
transfer orders on his own behalf, it is not immediately evident that he has
effective control.  I feel that he does not.  I feel that you do not have
effective control over an asset if making use of that asset requires you to
pay a penalty above and beyond the necessity of writing the transfer order,
and the resultant loss of the asset.  In this case, the penalty imposed on
Kolja's ability to dispose of his voting tokens is the loss of his grant of
Power of Attourney.  While this may be considered a very small loss, I would
be uncomfortable about extending the influence of 'A Duty to Vote' to allow
it to compel the loss of anything other than voting tokens.

But I don't really see this as even a small loss, since Kolja can immediately
reinstate PoA after disposing of eir VTs as desired.  It is an inconvenience,
to be sure, since it requires more key-strokes than an ordinary transfer, but
there is no loss of functionality for PoA as a result of this inconvenience.

I'm unclear, when you talk about wishes, whether you are referring to the
ability of Steve to discharge Kolja's Duty to Vote by using eir PoA, but this
is another interesting question to consider.   I think someone expressed an
opinion that this is not possible, but I don't remember seeing an argument to
support this opinion.  Anyone care to comment?  (I still have to think about
it 8)).

Protoproposal Chaos62 [rev. 6]

Executorship

Be it resolved, that Rule 1478 be amended to read:

      (a) The Executor of an entity is a Player who is empowered by
          the Rules to act on behalf of that entity, as if e was that
          entity.
        (1) Except when the Rules stipulate otherwise, a Player is eir
            own Executor.
        (2) Any other entity has an Executor only when the Rules
            permit that entity to have an Executor, and a Certificate
            of Executorship has been filed with the Notary for that
            entity.

      (b) Before a Player may act as the Executor of an entity, e must
          file with the Notary a Certificate of Executorship.  A
          Certificate of Executorship must set out:
        (1) the entity of which the Player is the Executor;
        (2) the Player's own name; and
        (3) the authority under which that Player claims to be
            Executor of that entity.

      (c) The Notary shall maintain a record of all Certificates of
          Executorship filed with em, and shall include in eir weekly
          Report a list of every entity not a Player which has an
          Executor, and the Player named in the most recent
          Certificate of Executorship filed with em for that entity.

      (d) A person ceases to be the Executor of an entity when that
          person ceases to be a Player, any other Rule to the contrary
          notwithstanding.

      (e) The determination by an Officer that a Player was not acting
          as the Executor of an entity other than emself shall not be
          subject to judicial review, in those cases where no
          Certificate of Executorship has been filed with the Notary
          naming that Player as the Exector of the entity in question.

      (f) Any Player who files a false Certificate of Executorship
          commits a Class B Crime.  A Judge who determines that a
          Certificate of Executorship was filed falsely shall Order
          the Notary to disregard that filing.

      (g) For the purpose of subdivision (e) of this Rule, the holder
          of any of the following positions shall be considered an
          Officer when performing a duty required by or a privilege
          permitted only by virtue of holding that position:
        (1) the Speaker;
        (2) the Recordkeepor of a Currency; or
        (3) the Trustee of an entity in Probate.

First, Kolja cannot immediately restore the PoA.  He needs Steve to accept,

do so immediately, there would be a lag, a temporary loss of PoA which could
have negative effects.

I'm referring to the definition of effective control:
      Effective control of an asset (e.g., a unit of Currency) is the
      ability to dispose of that asset as one wishes
Since Steve is not obliged to dispose of Kolja's voting tokens as Kolja
wishes, Steve's ability to execute transfer orders for Kolja's voting tokens
does not constitute effective control of Kolja's voting tokens by Kolja
(although it does constitute effective control for Steve).  
Steve could not have discharged Kolja's duty to vote (if Kolja had one),
because Power of Attourney only grants executorship.  The ability to vote
derives from being a player, and is not granted with executorship.
Therefore, if Kolja had a duty to vote (because PoA was granted after the
start of the voting period), Steve would not be able to satisfy it by voting
in Kolja's name.

Actually, there would not be a temporary loss of PoA, but it is true that
the inconvience is more than I had originally thought.  Steve has to issue
an acceptance message *before* the PoA is granted.  This means both
Steve and Kolja would have to act in concert for this.  Steve would
have to post eir acceptance and then Kolja would issue the message
to revoke, transfer, and then reinstate PoA.  But it means Kolja can,
with work and cooperation, exercise eir control over eir assets without
loss of PoA functionality.

Agreed.

I disagree.  Executorship Rules specifically claim that the Executor can act
"as if e was that entity".  This means all the abilities that derive from
being "that entity" are inherited by the Executor.  So the abiltity to vote,
as if e were Kolja, *is* granted with executorship to Steve and Steve
*can* vote in Kolja's name.  But this still leaves unanswered the question
of whether obligations which are imposed on a Player can be discharged
by an Executor other than the Player emself.  But if Steve is acting
"as if" e were Kolja, why would you not say that the action was completed
"as if" Kolja had done it?  If it was done "as if" Kolja had done it, why
wouldn't the action satisfy Kolja's obligation?  Would you also say, then,
that an Officer is still required to personally post eir official report each
week, even if e has granted PoA to some other Player who then has
the ability to post an official report on the Officer's behalf?

My mistake.  I didn't look at executorship closely enough.  Given that Steve
can vote in Kolja's name, then he can satisfy Kolja's duty to vote, since
the duty to vote only imposes a penalty if a player does not vote.  If Steve
used his executorship to cause Kolja to vote, then Kolja would have voted.  
In regards to the issue of effective control, I'm not convinced.  There is
clearly a path Kolja can take to access his voting tokens, without losing
his PoA.  The only thing that still bothers me is that he requires Steves
assistance to access the voting tokens in this manner.  In other words,
Kolja can either unilaterally access his voting tokens, with an extremely
minor penalty, or he can access his voting tokens with no penalty, but
needing Steves cooperation.  In the first case, Kolja is constrained by the
penalty imposed on him for accessing his voting tokens.  In the second case,
Kolja is constrained by the necessity of Steves consent and cooperation.  
	Now, the second case is somewhat more nebulous, since the only
penalty Steve can impose, if he choses to withdraw his consent, is one he
could impose at any time - that of discontinuing the PoA.  I think though,
that the fact that Kolja would require Steve's cooperation means that he is
not in effective control of those voting tokens.  The fact that he requires
help to access them implies that he does not possess full control of them.

Kolja requires help to access them "without penalty" as you describe.
I'm still not sure I would describe this required loss of PoA as a penalty,
but in any case, I would agree that Kolja does not possess *full*
control, but rather e shares control with Steve.

However, I remain of the opinion that shared control is still effective
control.  Even though Kolja may have to give up something e wants
(i.e. a granted PoA) in order to exercise that control, e still retains
the ability to exercise it at all times.

I don't care for the "penalty" argument at all. If losing one's PoA
is a penalty great enough to void effective control, then why isn't
the penalty of having to wait 30 minutes for my dial-up connection
to be established so I can vote just as great?

I think you need to include some recognition that a penalty to use does
impose a limitation to control.  For example, the executor of the bank can
issue legal transfer orders from the bank.  If he does, however, he will pay
a penalty.  I think that that penalty is what denies him effective control
of the bank.  However, I also agree that the loss of a granted PoA is an
extremely slight penalty.  I think it would be quite reasonable for a judge
to rule that the loss of a granted PoA does not constitute sufficient
penalty to deny effective control.

One could argue that the calories consumed in whacking one's
fingertips into the keyboard constitute a penalty.

I personally do not believe that the "penalty" imposed is sufficient
to constitute a disability.
