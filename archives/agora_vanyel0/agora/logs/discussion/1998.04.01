I like it (getting rid of it entirely if possible; limiting it
if not).  I wouldn't mind eliminating Waiving Quorum either.

This April Fool's Day Holiday, when exactly does it start and end, given
that April 1st occurs at different times all over the world?

Also, I note that a Quarterly Speaker Change is due.

I already have a nomination for CotC from you.  You'll have to wait
until voting starts before you actually vote.

I don't think 1089 has been appealed by three Players yet.  If it were
to be appealed, then I would be on the Appelate Court for it, though I
am not a Justice for CFJ 1090's appeal (because I judged it).

So, whatever the merits of the current rules wrt this situation, they
will not save us from having different Appeal Board Justices (if 1089
is appealed).

Indeed.  (Changing the composition of the Appeals Board for CFJ 1089
once more.)

Since the message I replied to, Steve has appealed the CFJ in
question, so I'll be announcing an Appeals Court for this tomorrow
(after our Holiday).

I don't think I did.  I haven't contributed to this debate recently at
all.

I think Agora tends to abide by Universal Time, when no other

If this timing is intended to give the Players forewarning, it is flawed: 
There is nothing preventing the Promotor from changing the Batch Size and
distributing a batch at 11:45 PM Sunday and 0:15 AM Monday, respectively.

I'm aware of that. I considered ways to tighten things up so that a
certain amount of forewarning would be required. Probably the simplest
way to do this would be to require the Promotor to make any anouncement
about the Batch Size for the following Week before, say, Thursday
1200 GMT, the half way point of the Week. But then I thought, if the
Promotor wants to ambush people, why not give em the power to do so,
if they're prepared to put in a little effort? But maybe you'd prefer
the enforced warning?

Indeed. The new Speaker Transition Rules get their first test.

R1581 has called for a Speaker Transition to occur. According to
R402, the Registrar is now obliged, asap, to post a Notice of
Speaker Transition, identifying the Speaker-Elect and the reason
for the Transition. The Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker upon the
posting of that Notice, and the new Speaker will be the Arbiter of
Succession. In the meantime, I have lost whatever rights and
privileges accrue to me because I am the Speaker.

I remind Registrar Michael that I was Speaker during the entire
month of March.

I guess I was kind of worried about Players (like me) with a lot of
P-Notes. If decreasing Priority is cheap, I could effectively prevent
any Proposal from being distributed, forcing Players to deal with me,
a rather unpleasant scenario for other Players. On the other hand, 
if Tabula Rasa passes, P-Notes are going to be pretty damn scarce:
the number in circulation will drop from about 250 at the moment to
17. Then we should really see the battles for Priority begin to bite.

I thought out of the blue: What if the Promotor were only allowed to
distribute one more or one fewer Proposal than the week before (or the
same number)?

According to the Net Nomic DB, "Illuminomic" already exists, and is
poised to take over our lives. Of course, one wonders why, if it does 
exist, that it should be advertising its existance. Doesn't that 
contradict the point of being a secret society?

The Appeal Board for the Appeal of CFJ 1090 is Morendil, Swann and myself.
Given that I appealed CFJ 1089 yesterday, what will be the makeup of the
Appeal Board for that Appeal? Presumably Morendil will be on it as
Justiciar, and you will be on it as CotC. What about me? This turns
out to be a surprisingly subtle question! 

Let's be a bit careful here for a moment and pay attention to details.
The new Speaker Transition Rules mean that I don't stop being Speaker
until you announce it (as Registrar). You are required to post a 
Notice of Speaker Transition "as soon as possible after the Speaker
Transition commences" (R402). When was that? According to R1581,
a Speaker Transition occurs "upon the commencement of each new
Quarter". Presumably, then, you incurred the obligation to post a
Notice of Speaker Transition as soon as possible after midnight GMT,
April 1. But wait! April 1, or April Fool's Day, was a Holiday, and
R1769 says that:

      If some Rule bases the time of a future event upon the time of
      another event, or requires that a Player perform some action
      within some time of another event, and that event occurs during
      a Holiday, the time at which the Holiday ends shall be used
      instead for the purpose of determining the time of the future
      event or of the time by which the Player must perform the
      specified action.

So the first question to be answered is: did the process of Speaker
Transition commence during the Holiday or just before it? If it was
during the Holiday, then the timing provisions of R1769 will be
operative. If not, the ordinary provisions of R1023 be effective. I
tend to think it must have been during the Holiday, because R1581
says that the Transition occurs "upon the commencement of each new
Quarter". If it had said "at the end of each Quarter", I would have
been inclined to hold that the Transition occurred before the Holiday
commenced, but it says "upon the commencement of each Quarter" so I
think we should rule that R1769 governs. If that's right, you didn't
incur the obligation to post a Notice of Speaker Transition until
the Holiday ended at midnight GMT, April _2_.

Now, what about the Appeal of CFJ 1089? I think I posted it about
0115 GMT, April 1. At any rate, it was definitely during the Holiday.
In the ordinary course of events, R1570 would require you (as CotC
this time) to post the announcement of Appeal as soon as possible
after the Appeal had been initiated. Becuase of the Holiday, however,
you did not in fact incur this obligation until the end of the
Holiday, once again, midnight GMT, April 2.

So, because of the Holiday, two separate obligations which you
would have incurred at different times you in fact incurred at
the same time. Note, however, that the question of which order you
incurred the obligations in is separate from the question of which
order you would have been required (sans Holiday), to perform them
in - because the requirements are due to separate Offices! *If* the
requirements had been associated with a single Office, and *if* they
had been imposed upon in a particular order, then R1023 would have
required you to perform them in that order. Remarkably, in the
present case, neither condition holds. Therefore, you are doubly
free to perform the actions required of you (announcing the Appeal
and posting the Notice of Speaker Transition) in whichever order
you prefer.

OK, so the next question is: does the order matter? Well, maybe.
Pretty clearly, if you choose to post the announcement of Appeal
before the Notice of Speaker Transition, then I'll still be 
Speaker and presumably serve on the Appeal Board. (Unless, of
course, some bright spark wants to argue that serving on the
Appeals Board is a "special right [or] privilege" of the Speaker
within the meaning of R402. But I doubt that that is true.)
If you chose that order, then 2 of the 3 Justices serving on the
Appeals would be the same.

If you choose the other order, what then? Here we're back in a
situation the Courts had to deal with a little while back, in
which the holder of the one of Justice-positions changes between
the time the Appeal is initiated and the time it is announced.
But I can't remember which we precedent we chose to set on that
previous occasion. I'll have to have a trawl through the Court
records.

Anyway, there it all is, laid out in its intricate detail. It's
all in your hands, really.

Doesn't appeal, for some reason. I think I like the idea of the
Promotor's being able to make sharp changes: maybe 2 Proposals
one week, and 6 the next.

Proto-Proposal
Variable Batch Sizes

[Comment: fixed the bug spotted by Murphy (I think?), and decided
after all to force the Promotor to give a bit of warning - 4 days,
in fact. Note that "midnight GMT Thursday" is assumed to mean
Wednesday night/Thursday morning, in line with the customary 
interpretation of R459.]

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule entitled "The Promotor can change
the Batch Size" be created with the following text:

      The Batch Size is an integer with a value between two and six
      inclusive, indicating the number of Proposals which will be
      distributed by the Promotor in the following Nomic Week,
      provided that there are that many Proposals in the Queue.
      Unless the Rules give it another value, the Batch Size is five.

      The Promotor may change the value of the Batch Size by
      announcing the new value in the Public Forum, provided that
      e announces a value between two and six inclusive, that e makes
      the announcement prior to midnight GMT Thursday, and that e has
      not already made such an announcement earlier in the Week. As
      indicated above, this change in the Batch Size has the effect
      of changing the number of Proposals which will be distributed
      by the Promotor in the Nomic Week *following* that in which the
      change is made; once the Week has begun, the Promotor cannot
      change the number of Proposals which will be distributed in
      that Week by changing the Batch Size.
      
Be it further resolved that R1770 (Distributing Proposals) be amended
by replacing the text in which currently reads:

      If there are five or fewer Proposals in the Proposal Queue
      having a Priority greater than zero, then the batch shall
      consist of all such Proposals.

      If there are more than five such proposals, then the batch
      shall consist of the first five such Proposals, in the order
      given by the Queue.

with text which reads:

      If the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue with a
      Priority greater than zero is less than or equal to the Batch
      Size, then the batch shall consist of all such Proposals.

      If the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue is greater
      than the Batch Size, then the batch shall consist of those
      Proposals in the Queue with the highest Priority such that the
      number of Proposals distributed is equal to the Batch Size.

I think this is the CFJ I was referring to in my long post about my
eligibility to serve as Justice in the Appeal of CFJ 1089. Its actual
relevance is debatable, however. R911 says that the Speaker shall
be selected, if eligible, but it's still unclear precisely at what 
time the test for eligibility is to be applied.

Anyway, here's CFJ 1046.

======================================================================
                               CFJ 1046

Calabresi is ineligible to serve as a Justice in the Appeal of CFJ 933.

======================================================================

Judge:       Michael

Judgement:   

Eligible:    Blob, Calabresi, ChrisM, Chuck, Crito, Elde, 
	     elJefe, General Chaos, Harlequin, Kolja A., Michael, 
             Morendil, Murphy, Oerjan, Vir, Vlad, Zefram

Not eligible:
Caller:      Steve
Barred:      Andre
On request:  Vanyel
On hold:     Swann

======================================================================

History:
  Called by Steve, timestamp lost
  Assigned to Michael, 1 Oct 1997 19:33:25 +0200 (MET DST)
  Judged TRUE by Michael, 3 Oct 1997 16:50:35 +0100

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Rule 911 states in part:

      A Player is ineligible for selection if any of the following is
      true:

       iv) E was ineligible to Judge the CFJ that resulted in the
           matter under consideration, and this restriction does not
           prevent three eligible Players from being selected by the
           CotC for the Board.

CFJ 933 was called on Aug 4, a week before Calabresi registered to
play. Calabresi was, therefore, ineligible to Judge the CFJ, and so
satisfies the criterion of R911(iv) for being ineligible to serve
as Justice.

Andre has argued that Calabresi was later eligible to serve as a
Judge when the CFJ was re-assigned after the initial Judge defaulted.
This is true, but it no way changes the fact that Calabresi was, at
one time, ineligible to serve as Judge, and so is ineligible to serve
as Justice. R911 does not say that a Player who was never eligible
to serve as Judge is ineligible to serve as Justice.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

Judgement: TRUE

Reasons and arguments: 

R911 spells out the conditions under which a Player is ineligible for
selection as Justice.  It is clear and undisputed by the Caller that
Calabresi doesn't satisfy conditions i, ii, iii or v.

The question remains: was Calabresi ineligible to Judge the original
CFJ?  If so, then they are ineligible to serve as Justice in the
Appeal of that CFJ by condition iv.

This question needs careful consideration.  In particular, what sense
are we to make of the "was" in condition iv?  

It's clearly ridiculous to claim that this refers to arbitrary
instants of time in history, as we were all ineligible to judge CFJs
before they were called, before we joined the game or before the game
started. 

In fact the wording of the relevant rules makes it clear the
eligibility is an attribute that should only be calculated when a CFJ
is assigned a Judge.  

Here we come to our next problem: when the CFJ was first assigned,
Calabresi was not a Player.  The rules do not explicitly discuss the
eligibility status of non-Players, so we have to turn to common-sense
and game custom to tell us that non-Players are not eligible as
Judges.   (The language of the Judge selection rule (R951) tells us
that Judges are to be selected from amongst eligible Players, not
necessarily implying that other classes of people are ineligible.
However, here the common-sense view of what it is to be eligible must
be appealed to, if it is impossible for one to be selected for
something because of one's status, this is equivalent to being
ineligible.)

Therefore Calabresi is ineligible to serve as a Justice in the appeal
of CFJ 933.
