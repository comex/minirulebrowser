And the Chancellor mints 1000000 VTs which expire at the end of Dec 2099.

Blob, 

Why not make people who are deregistered through being Lawless turn
into Zombies too? 

Also, in your Auction proposal, I suggest you could make for a much
simpler system using one closed, non-revokable bid per candidate, and
making the final price be the second highest bid.  Perhaps allow both
possibilities depending on whether or not the Auctioneer wants to keep
track of all the messages that the form you outline would result in.

Michael.

Sure (if VTs were an Expiring Currency).  Notice that in my conversion
of P-Notes to an Expiring Currency in the proto, I forced all payments
out of the Bank to have specific expiry conditions.  If the Chancellor
were to mint 100000 P-Notes of expiry date Dec 2099, they would do
nothing but sit in the Bank until 2099, at which point they might
become useful.

I don't know if you're attempting to criticise the proto, but I don't
think the above scenario poses any difficulties.  (The Accountor might
think the record-keeping for the above a slight extra burden, and
might deKudo the Chancellor for creating that extra work
unnecessarily, but I don't think it would be pragmatically
significant.)

Michael.

Suggested rewording:

"As soon as possible after the end of a Proposal's Voting Period, the
 Assessor shall assess Votes on that Proposal as follows:

   (a) Assess the Vote(s) with the greatest Voting Bid.
   (b) Repeat step (a) until the number of Votes assessed equals or
       exceeds the number of Votes Available, or until all Votes
       are assessed, whichever comes first.
   (c) Assess all non-assessed ABSTAIN Votes, if any.

 The Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity a number of Voting Tokens
 equal to the total Voting Bids of all assessed Votes cast by that entity.

 Non-assessed Votes have no effect on Quorum or Proposal adoption."

Also, you may wish to prohibit ABSTAIN Votes from having a Voting Bid.
(Your
current proto merely frees them from requiring one.)

Hey, if someone wants to pay VTs to get a vote through that would be
processed anyway...

Some comments:

1) Those of us who still use 80 character ascii displays (old fogeys
that we are) have a tradition of formatting proposals with a 6 space
margin on the lefthand side, and a maximum of 70 characters per line
(including the 6 spaces). This is the format the ruleset is posted in.

2) You should give your new rules titles.

3) It's a nice idea, but I'm afraid it won't work very well.
Consider this: at the moment the Votes Available would be 7. That means
that you expect to have more than 7 people competing to vote on a
proposal. At the moment we are lucky to get 7 people to vote, or even
declare presence, on a proposal, even when voting is free! There will
be no competition, and since the minimum voting bid is zero, there
will be no incentive for anybody to bid more than that.

If you really want this to wrok, I think you'll have to reduce the
number of winning bids to a smaller number, say four or five. Of course,
that will make the system extremely undemocratic, but surely that's the
point.

4) As it stands, I don't see any reason why you should be changing the
value of Quorum.

5) You might want to make this a special kind of Auction, using my
new Auctions proposal.

Well, I chose to only do it to Players who were unlikely to be coming 
back soon. Lawless players might object. Also it would make coming back
from the dead much more complicated. But I'll think about it.

I realised when writing this proposal that there are so many kinds of
Auctions, it isn't easy to come up with a default model. I particularly
like the kind of auction I proposed (It's more exciting!) but I have 
considered making a "Standard Variations" rule, which defines other
possibilities.

Depending on where are how this system gets used, we may want to 
experiment with different kinds of Auction in much the same way as
we have experimented with different kinds of voting.
