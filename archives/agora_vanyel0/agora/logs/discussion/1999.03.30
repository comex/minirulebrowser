Hear, hear. As for poor benighted Steve, it seems to me that the current
state of the debate is as follows. Two separate justifications of
Summary Adoption have been put forward, one by you and one by Scott.
Scott's economic defence has been refuted - the right to Object is
economically worthless due to oversupply. Your defence, which I will
call 'procedural', comes down to a matter of taste over which procedures
are interesting, and that debate seems to be a stand off. If this were a
game of soccer, I'd say that the score is 1-0 in my favour, with about
10 minutes to play until full-time.

Don't worry too much.  I once slipped a "Murphy Wins" clause into a long
Proposal of mine, and it got spotted right quick.

        (1) a Name, unique from that of every other Organization;
        (2) an Agent; and
        (3) a Charter.
          Any Organization which ceases to have each of the items
          listed above is subject to administrative dissolution, as
          defined elsewhere.  No Organization shall be created or
          recognized which does not have each of the items listed
          above.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) In a conflict between the Bylaws and the Charter of an
          Organization, the Charter takes precedence.

      (b) In a conflict between the Bylaws or the Charter of an
          Organization and the Rules, the Rules take precedence.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1614 be amended to read:

      (a) An Organization's name shall only be changed when its Agent
          delivers a Notice of Change of Organizational Name to the
          Notary, which must set forth the Organization's old and new
          names.  The new name must be distinct from that of every
          other existing Organization.

      (b) A Notice of Change of Organizational Name may be rescinded
          by Judicial Order; such Order shall properly issue when the
          Notice was delivered contrary to the Charter and Bylaws of
          the Organization in question.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1612 be amended to read:

      (a) An Organization's name shall only be changed when its Agent
          delivers a Notice of Change of Organizational Charter to the

      (b) A Notice of Change of Organizational Charter shall set forth
          its current name and its new Charter.

      (c) A Notice of Change of Organizational Charter may be
          rescinded by Judicial Order; such Order shall properly issue
          when the Notice was delivered contrary to the Charter and
          Bylaws of the Organization in question.

      (d) In any CFJ alleging that the Charter of an Organization has
          been changed improperly, the Judge shall consider the
          Charter as it existed prior to the Change.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1531 be amended to read:

      (a) The Agent of an Organization must be a natural person.

      (b) The Agent of an Organization is required to abide by the
          Charter and Bylaws (if any) of that Organization.

      (c) An Organization's Executor is its Agent, if its Agent is a
          Player; otherwise, it has no Executor.

      (d) An Organization's Agent shall only be changed by
        (1) the delivery, by its current Agent, of a Notice of Change
            of Organizational Agent to the Notary, setting forth the
            current name of the Organization and its new Agent;
        (2) by the Notary, Without Objection; or
        (3) by Judicial Order, when the Rules permit such an Order to
            issue.

      (e) No person shall be made the Agent of an Organization without
          eir consent.  Any person who submits a Notice of Change of
          Organizational Agent certifies under penalty of
          Falsification that the new Agent consents.

      (f) A Notice of Change of Organizational Agent may be rescinded
          by Judicial Order; such Order shall properly issue when the

          the Organization in question, or when the new Agent does not
          in fact consent.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1759 be amended to read:

      The Executor of an Organization may execute Payment Orders, as

      thereof as payor.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1533 be amended to read:

      (a) An Organization may be created by the Execution of an

        (2) the identity of its initial Agent; and
        (3) the text of the Organization's initial Charter.

      (c) An Application to Create an Organization is Executed by
          submitting it to the Notary, and such Execution creates the
          Organization so described if the Application is valid.

      (a) An Organization shall be subject to dissolution when:
        (1) it ceases to have any of the items required of an
            Organization by the Rules; or
        (2) its Agent is not a Player and is not in close
            communication with anyone who is a Player.

          created by these Rules; in any case, a dissolved
          Organization ceases to be recognized by these Rules as a
          collective entity.

      (f) A Notice of Organizational Dissolution may be rescinded by
          Judicial Order; such Order shall properly issue when the
          Notice was delivered contrary to the Charter and Bylaws of
          the Organization in question. The Judge shall consider the
          last Charter and Bylaws of the Organization in making this
          determination.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1617 be amended to read:

      (a) An Organization may have Members.

          requires the Signature of the Executor of the entity to
          which the Will is to belong, and is Executed by submitting
          it to the Notary.  The effect of Executing such an
          Application is to create a Will belonging to that entity. 
          Any prior Will belonging to that entity is destroyed at the
          same time.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Each Organization in existence prior to the adoption of the
          Proposal which created this Rule is deemed to be an
          Organization created under the authority of these Rules, all
          other Rules notwithstanding.  The Charter of each such
          Organization shall be its former SLC, the Agent shall be the
          Adminstrator of its former SLC, and its Membership shall be
          those Players who were within the Jurisdiction of its former
          SLC.

      (b) This Rule in no way prevents the change of any of the
          characteristics set forth above by events occuring after the
          adoption of the Proposal which created this Rule.

      (c) This Rule shall take precedence over every Rule with which
          it conflicts.

OTOH, no one seemed to notice (or if they did, they didn't say anything)
when I slipped a "vacate all of Chuck's Blots" clause into a Proposal. :)

Protoproposal Chaos68 [rev. 6]

Keep Conway Out Of The Clock

Be it resolved, that Rule 1527 be amended to read:

      Whenever a message contains more than one notification, report,
      or other communication in which the Rules place some legal
      significance, and the relative order of those communications is
      legally relevant, those communications shall be considered to
      have been sent in the order in which they appear in that
      message.  All such communications are considered to have been
      sent at the same time, however.

Well, you've admitted that it is a matter of taste. And it seems to me
that most players do not share your taste for haggling over such 
insignificant issues. It takes a certain kind of player to enjoy making
spring-cleaning style proposals. They don't tend to be the wheeling-and-
dealing types. They should not be denied their role in the game.

The facts are on my side: the changes are not being made. I can't
guarantee that Summary Adoption is going to fix this, but it's never
going to have a chance if you keep stymie-ing it at every turn. Can you
at least let us try it out for a while?
