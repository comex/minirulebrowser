True, and a strict reading of R1728 would seem to require that.
One could probably argue that Blob's post implicitly expressed
his intention to declare that the Proposals have met Quorum.

I urge Agorans to vote FOR Proposals 3761 & 3763, both of which
remove inappropriate sources of VTs from the economy. I'm fairly
poor myself, but I'll make this offer: I'll pay 0.5 VTs to the
first 3 voters to vote FOR P3761. I'll leave Kolja, who has just
become fairly rich exploiting the loophole wich P3763 seeks to close,
to take steps concerning P3763.

I've already done so a few days ago: I said that this is obviously a
necessary fix, that I'll invest the P-note needed to distribute it and
a VT to vote for it, but that if the other Agorans don't vote for it
because it's a good proposal I'll continue to try and earn money this
way. 

BTW, I'm also tempted to object to Blob's quorum declaration, but I
guess at the moment I'd rather see my proposal pass. However, while
quorum buybacks at least require an expenditure of currency (and one
player can only make a small change), the speaker's privilege thing
seems to me to be a rather cheap way of spoiling all our recent
efforts to increase VT expenditure. Instead of effectively abolishing
quorum requirements altogether I'd rather see Presence reintroduced
(if we admit the failure of our VT scarcity program so easily, which
I'd rather not).

While I applaud all the efforts to increase VT scarcity and expenditure, I
think that ditching presence was a very bad idea. I think requiring that at
least three actual VTs be spent on a Proposal was a good way of increasing
expenditure without making passing a proposal hideously difficult; as it
is, I don't see how *anything* can get passed.

It only need 5 Players to decide to vote, although with three players
Denied Voting Privileges, that might be harder to achieve than usual.
But where are Chuck, elJefe, the General, Antimatter, Oerjan,
Michael, and so on? Chuck and Michael in particular are earning
regular Salaries but rarely vote. What are they saving their VTs for?

These early difficulties with Quorum were not unexpected. The question is
what reaction, if any, they will produce. I am hoping that an increasing
sense of frustration at Proposals failing Quorum will fuel a tendency
on the part of some Players to reverse their policy of not voting. I
am also hoping that the fact that the current situation without
Presence is structured as a 2 month trial will encourage Players not to
react simply by immediately reinstating Presence, but rather allow whatever
implications this experiment has to play themselves out.

Of course, there may be no reaction other than apathy. That would be
disappointing, but still a valuable lesson. It occurs to me that this
a particularly bad time to be conducting such an experiment though,
while some Players have a reduced level of activity due to the
northern summer. The same experiment conducted in September might
have quite different results.
