I think this may be the issue that disquiets Chuck and Oerjan, amongst
others.  Mathematical types are often unhappy with the way that
lawyers (and philosophers) fluidly shift from one schema to another,
often within the course of the same argument.  To a mathematician,
this isn't tidy.

Some do, some don't. I'd encourage it. Protoing gives people a chance
to point out any bugs in your proposals before it's proposed, or say
that they hate it and will never vote for it. Not that they will 
necessarily *take* the chance...

>Expect a lot of questions over the next few weeks before I get into the

Expected and encouraged.

Ah, yes, here it is. CFJ 900:

======================================================================
                               CFJ 900

"If the Registrar fails to produce a report in a given week, e
 violates Rule 101 and Rule 1502, and commits a Class C Crime."

======================================================================

Judge:       Steve

Judgement:   TRUE

Eligible:    Andre, Blob, Chuck, elJefe, Harlequin, KoJen, Macross,
             Michael, Murphy, Oerjan, Steve, Swann, Vanyel, Zefram

Not eligible:
Caller:      favor
Barred:      -
On hold:     Morendil

======================================================================

History:
  Called by favor, Mon, 3 Feb 97 09:21:08 EST
  Assigned to Steve, Wed, 5 Feb 1997 10:10:19 +0000
  Judged TRUE, Sun, 9 Feb 1997 01:48:29 +1100 (EST)
  Published, as of this message

======================================================================

Judgement: TRUE

Reasons and arguments:

I hereby Judge the Statement TRUE. Its truth is self-evident from
an examination of the first paragraph of R1502:

      There is a set of information known as the Registrar's Report.
      The Registrar shall maintain all the information in the
      Registrar's Report, and post the Report to the Public Forum
      at least once every Nomic Week A Registrar that fails to do so
      commits a Class C Crime.

The Registrar is required to produce a Report and post it every
week. Failure to do so violates this requirement of R1502, is a
Class C Crime as described in this Rule, and furthermore violates
the stricture in R101 to obey all the Rules then in effect.

Relevant Rules: 1502, 101

======================================================================

Entirely optional.  I think the only curmudgeon who swore never to
vote for a proposal that had not been protoproposed was KoJen, and
he's not presently registered.

What Rule ? I certainly don't know what you're talking about. Nor do
I want to anyway. With all these ghastly penalties around for even
mentioning or alluding to Rule number, oops, almost said it, which
we passed when Chuck wasn't around it's better not to prolong the
discussion. What do you mean I posted this to the list ? It was 
supposed to be private !

You forget historians of all kinds - nearly all practicians of the
social and human sciences in fact. However, I suspect that even 
mathematicians are not themselves so uncompromisingly rigorous.
Creative intellectual activity, whatever its particular 'flavor', 
depends in part on flexibility.

One of the reasons I like Agora so much is precisely the way it pits
several types of thinking against one another; historical analysis,
pure logic, debates on semantics, analogies with RL legal
principles, etc.

Maybe Agora's sigil should be the Necker cube, rather than the
infinity symbol.

All these discussions about legal deeming and legal fiction sound
rather interesting. However, I only speak english as a second
language, and I'm not a lawyer, so I don't yet understand what these
terms stand for. Could one of those who know help me with a short
vocabulary entry or definition of what "legal deeming" and "legal
fiction" stand for?

Well, I think that there is an additional requirement: not only should
the document _be_ available as you describe it, but the persons
involved must also _know_ that is available in this sense (remember
the destruction of Arthur Dent's house? The plans for that were
"available", too...)

I'll agree with you there.  I'll also agree with your implicit
statement that it is not always clear whether a given Rule
establishes a legal fiction or redefines a word--they must
be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, however.  (And as
far as R880 goes, I realize that my proposed wording isn't
all that great either, and even I consider it only marginally
better than the current form, which is why I'm not concerned
with trying to change the language of R880.

It's also not clear that the precedent of Real World law would
apply to Agora. :)

You're arguing, then, that these neither establish a fiction, nor
redefine a term, on the basis that Location is a term completely
unrelated to location?  That seems a reasonable position, although
I'm not sure I would completely agree with it--didn't we have
a precedent that capitalization alone doesn't change the meaning
of a word?  (I seem to vaguely recall a case where a word with special
meaning, capitalized in most instances in the Ruleset, was found
to have that saame special meaning in an instance where it wasn't
capitalized.  I could be imagining it, though.)

Here, I disagree--if we redefine Location, it does not necessarily
follow that we also have redefined all terms with meaning normally
related to "location" in standard English.  (In the case of
my Rule, "in".  You will note I was deliberately careful not
to use "location," "located," or similar words in the Rule.)

That's an interesting question.  I would say if it really *is*
available on request, then it's available as a matter of
fact--but how do you tell if it's really available on
request.

For example, it has always been my policy to send the Ruleset
to anyone upon request, as the Rules require me to.  Now suppose
that I decide that I am going to, in violation of the Rules, change
that policy, and *not* send out the Ruleset upon request.  (Although
technically, I'm not in violation of the Rules merely for making
that policy change, only when someone actually requests the
Rules and I don't send them out in time.)  I don't tell
anyone of this policy.

Now, a new player joins without having read the Ruleset.  E
does *not* request the Ruleset.  (If e did, I would not send
it to em, but nobody knows that but me.)  I would say the
Ruleset is not available to em as a matter of fact, but how
does anyone besides me know that?  [Assume for the sake of argument
that the Ruleset is not available from other sources.]

Let's not forget the swiss cheese!

<history>
Some time back, one of the players commented that the Rules were
so full of holes, they were like a swiss cheese.  For some time
after that, it was customary to call the Ruleset "the swiss
cheese" when being critical of it.

Here is a Proto-CFJ which I would like comments on:

Proto-CFJ:

By default, those aspects of Real World law and juridical custom that are
not well known to persons of an average acquaintance with such matters
belong to the category of "other standards" for the purpose of Rule 217.

I, for one, would have no problem judging this TRUE.  If there
is anyone who would judge it FALSE, I will be very interested to see your
reasoning.

I think the weakness of this proto CFJ statement may be what you mean
by "average acquaintance" - average for whom? Academics with a law
background? People with an Anglosaxon background (in other words: Case
law, statutory law and other (for people like me) strange and exotic
concepts)? 

Of course, you might be referring to the average Nomic, or Agora,
player. But nevertheless, as a judge, I wouldn't really know what kind
of "aspects of Real World law and juridical custom" the CFJ refers to.

My view on this is that in order to make sense of both 101 and the
Precedence system it is necessary to consider Rules to be not 'in effect'
when they are being taken precedence over. [Uh... was that a reasonably
grammatical English sentence?]

Since 1513 is not any less explicit about 'effect' than the Precedence
Rules (which don't mention the word either), it then seems reasonable that
it should be equally effective at removing effect.

Ørjan.

No. Telling New Players what they need to know in order to play Agora is
only basic politeness.

Besides, this ties nicely into the "made available" discussion. It does
not seem reasonable to consider documents available to a Player until e
has received basic information on what they are and how to obtain them.

Right. There has to be an absolute (though not necessarily predetermined) 
answer to each question about Agoran matters.

Now, for all these philosophical splits, if there were a way to demand
that both ways of looking at things should give the same answer to
practical questions, then we would have the ultimate compromise and
everyone would be happy... except, I guess, those who had to be careful in
formulating Rules so as not to break this principle.

It seems that Steve was a bit too enthousiastic about subscribing people.
I got the mail from gecko double. First I thought there was some mistake
in the way it was set up, until I checked the list of subscribers, and saw
that not only engels@win.tue.nl, but also csg419@wing.rug.nl was subscribed.
Which has not been my address since one year now...

I would agree.  I think the discussion and examples so far show that it is not
really possible to determine if something has been made available to a Player
based on any particular definition of "made available".  It is something that
would have to be determined case by case based on the evidence at hand.

That Player would be Ronald Kunne, of many nicknames over the years.

I doubt that I would find it FALSE; the only potentially appropriate
recognition other than "other standards" would be "common sense", but
I cannot consider matters that are not well known to persons of
average knowledge to be "common sense".

This concurs with my opinion on the matter (I think).  I don't think
that a Rule which acts to deprives itself or another Rule of effect,
either generally or in specific situations, conflicts with Rule 101.
I would, therefore, hold that a Rule held in abeyance by Rule 1513
would not "be in effect" for the purpose of Rule 101.

I am less clear whether a Rule held in abeyance by Rule 1513 would be
in conflict with Rule 1513.  I tend to think not, but I'm not certain.

Be careful now. If that were true, it would be possible to effectively
repeal any Rule regardless of MI by a MI=1 Rule (e.g. "Rule
116 does not need to be obeyed by any Player).
