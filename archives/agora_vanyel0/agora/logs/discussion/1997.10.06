Trivially false if, as I suspect, Elde has been deregistered for
Lawlessness.

Well, it's official then. VTs were destroyed.

I think we could have reached the same conclusion just from the fact
that the Judgement was TRUE, regardless of the argument. Although
Crito argued that Indulgences, the Currency, continued to exist by
virtue of the low number of R1435, I don't think he ever denied that
the individual units of Currency ceased to exist.

So you say, "If CFJ 1 is relevant, CFJ 2000 is relevant."  But
doesn't that lead to "If CFJ 2001 is relevant, CFJ 2001 is
relevant," which provides no guidance at all one way or the
other as to whether CFJ 2001 is relevant?

Yep, that's pretty much the line of reasoning I'm proposing here,
although I'm not sure I agree with it myself. :)

Hmmm, no, that would have come out too high. I remember once as Promotor
having made a mistake that caused a Proposal Number to come out 1000 too
high, so there have been made about 1000 Proposals less than you'd get
by a simple substraction.

Yes, I did notice it. In fact I have made some Kudo Transfer on basis of

I disagree.  Blob is a person named Malcolm Ryan (IIRC), who is not you,

It seems you have only tried Oerjan. If you take Orjan Johanson, it goes up
to 36 hits. Changing your search engine to Hotbot would then double the
number again, making 77 in total.

It will be necessary to check the records; I am not certain whether we
have behaved as though the individual Indulgences and P-Notes
survived, or not.

OTOH, I am permitted to "act as if I were" Blob (or, rather, Elde
was permitted to do so, and I stood in the same relationship with
respect to Elde - but that's not the point). Thus, any responsibility
that Blob incurred - including under the PF Rules - could presumably
be fulfilled by me. Again, the question is of how far the legal
fiction designated by the term 'Executor' can apply.

Except that since CFJ 2001 refers only to itself circularly, it never
refers to the rules, and is therefore irrelevant.  If you can show me
the text of CFJ 1 and it refers to the rules, or refers to a CFJ which
refers to the rules, etc, then CFJ 2000 will be relevant.

Because of the recent rash of defaulted judgements, under either scenario, Elde
now has more than 30 Blots, at least as of my reading this message.  There may
be other messages in my queue from over the weekend that change this, so it
might be best to wait for my latest report before taking any action.

There are no jumps anywhere that large in the Ruleset's Proposal data,
except Crito's Scam.

I think your case was determined to be a reporting error rather than an
actual misnumbering.

We don't have any such jump in Rule numbers, either: we are only up to the
1700's, and it was far above 1000 when we stopped linking Rule and
Proposal numbers.  Rule 1431 (February 1995) was the last Rule to have the
same number as its Creator Proposal. Rule 1432 was created by Proposal
1438. 

Now let me make a table for the Rule numbers while I am at it. 

There does appear to be no Rules numbered in the 1100's and only one in
the 1200's. However, this was while Rule numbers still were tied to
Proposal numbers, and probably coincides with one of the Chromatic Repeals
(Oct. - Nov. 1994.) 

 100's: 13 remaining Rules (From original Immutable)
 200's: 3 remaining Rules (From original Mutable)
 300's: 1 remaining Rules
 400's: 8 remaining Rules
 500's: 5 remaining Rules
 600's: 7 remaining Rules
 700's: 12 remaining Rules
 800's: 7 remaining Rules
 900's: 8 remaining Rules
1000's: 21 remaining Rules
1200's: 1 remaining Rules
1300's: 12 remaining Rules
1400's: 30 remaining Rules
1500's: 53 remaining Rules
1600's: 67 remaining Rules
1700's: 37 remaining Rules

I thought there was a large jump in the CFJ numbers due to a previous mass
CFJing.  This is why I based my average CFJ estimate on the "Recent CFJs" 
report, rather than on the current number divided by Agora's age - the
latter would have given an average of 4-5 CFJs per week, rather than 1. 

However, a check of my old/nomic folder seems to indicate that the CFJ
activity was simply much higher in previous times. 

Greetings,
Ørjan.

I would assume this means the entity in Probate (Blob) no longer has an
Executor in Probate, meaning the Notary must assign a new Executor in Probate
for that entity (Blob).

No, you misspelled my surname, using a Swedish spelling.  I think you will
find that those are mostly Swedes.  The name "Örjan" is much more common
in Sweden than in Norway.

I was looking for Norwegians. I tried several spellings of "Ørjan", but I
only tried "Johansen", which is the Norwegian form of my surname, rather
than "Johanson" which is a Swedish form (as well as the much more common
"Johansson".)

While "Ørjan" is relatively rare in Norway, "Johansen" is one of the most
common surnames (being a patronymicon of a very common first name.) 

Greetings,
Ørjan (whose parents considered calling him "Ørjar". Now _that_ is a rare
name, but it is also distinctly Norwegian rather than Swedish. An
Altavista search shows that there is a sociology professor in Bergen by
the name "Ørjar Øyen".)

That's an easy enough complaint to deal with, it's just a matter of

Where did the presently existing P-Notes come from, then?  I don't
recall ever having minted any.  Note also that P-Notes and Indulgences
are both without a Mintor, if VTs were destroyed.

The Romans didn't have newspapers, of course, but there's really no reason
you cant use the word "subscribo". The imperative (which is what we are
concerned with here) would be, amusingly enough, "s-bscribe" (though
pronounced with three syllables instead of two).

How about "No anagram of sbuscribe" may be used...."

Re: DIS: P-Notes and Indulgences

Scott asks:

>recall ever having minted any.

I re-established the P-Note holdings from the July 20 report, since I was
assuming that the ratification in Harlequin's fix proposal was effective. 
Also, I'm pretty sure you minted 10 P-Notes to cover the new player rewards for
Calabresi and Vir, but I can't find the message.  It's moot anyway, now.

>Note also that P-Notes and Indulgences
>are both without a Mintor, if VTs were destroyed.

Right, so P-Notes are not a Currency.  But I think precedence makes Indulgences
a Currency, although we have none and no way to make any at the moment.

Well, yes and no. I did indeed misspell it Johanson, but that did not
get any hits in combination with Oerjan (or Orjan, for that matter), so
I realized something went wrong, and corrected to Johansen, and found the
number I am giving. However, the 'Johanson' has sticked so deep in my mind
that I made the same mistake again when compiling the post. So it's indeed
Orjan Johansen that got 36 hits.

Yes, but we're trying not to limit what we don't have to. "No one-word

(you know, those expletives uttered by messy eaters who forgot to wear

Results of CFJ933 on Indulgences

This is not an official report, and nothing in it should be construed as the
report of an Infraction or as the issuance of a Payment Order.  It is merely 
information on what I think is the current game state, given the judgement of
CFJ 933.  This reflects the status of Indulgences just prior to what would have
been my Monday report (before the report of any new PI Infractions in that
report).

OK, I used orjan-johansen while you obviously used +orjan +johansen.  The
latter indeed gives 38 hits at the moment, but if I were you I wouldn't
bet any money that the "orjan" and the "johansen" correspond to the same
person in most of those web pages. 

Now, if you use the power search and "orjan NEAR johansen", you get 7
hits. Adding some alternative spellings of "Ørjan" gives 30. I still
wouldn't bet on all those.

Interestingly, one of those hits is for "Ørjan Berg Johansen". Now that is
the name on all those housebuilding ads I got. Too bad he didn't give his
email address.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

OK, I'm not a phonetician but I play one in Agora.

Lax O umlaut (the German one feels tenser),
slightly trilled r,
y as in yes (but probably softer, the "ja" is a diphthong),
a as in father (more or less),
n as in never,
stress on the first syllable.

y as in yes (as above),
some sound between continental "o" and "u",
h as in house,
a as in father,
n as in never,
s as in sail,
syllabic n (in my dialect), or e as in pet + n as in never (standard
pronunciation),
stress on the "a".

Oh, and both words are supposed to be pronounced in the second tone.  This
means more or less, that all syllables should be on the same note rather
than those after the stressed one being darker, as in the first tone. I
think. I can pronounce and recognize it, but explain it?

<anecdote>
It seems appropriate to mention the Icelandic statistician at our
institute. Her Norwegian is flawlessly like a western dialect, so much so
that few suspect her of being a foreigner until they are told so (She
usually uses her Norwegian husband's surname, so her name is no hint.) But
she cannot recognize the tones. She even refused to believe that they
existed. To convince her, some people at the institute had to perform a
blind statistical experiment to prove that they could distinguish words
she couldn't. :-)

Not so fast ! Blob is not a terminal estate, nor is e deregistered -
there is therefore no Rule that required that an EiP should be
assigned to Blob. For all intents and purposes, as I currently read
the Rules, Blob is a 'normal' Player.

I can see no Rule that says that someone leaves Probate just because e is
no longer a terminal estate. 

I also cannot see that someone stops being EiP just because e deregisters.
I suspect that Elde is still Blob's EiP.

Executors are Players. Elde is not a Player. Ergo, Elde is not an 
EiP, QED. ;)

Well, a Player is eir own Executor - what could be more natural ?

Weren't there a lot of Indulgence POs with the Bank as Payor and some 
Players as Payees, too ?

And what about the PI Infractions committed by the Bank as a result ?

And, lastly, what do you think of this idea : that the Chancellor,
in officially reporting the number of VTs held by the Bank at a time
when the actual number was 0 VTs, thereby implicitly *minted* X VTs
at that time - rather than misreport the actual game state ?

I have never, as Chancellor, made any allegation as to the number of
VTs in the Bank.  I think you are stretching things excessively to
imply that an Assessor's Report might have that effect merely because
the Chancellor and the Assessor are, at the moment, the same person.

Couldn't we just ratify a very recent report or three?

It was recently argued that an Officer's reporting of fact, in a
context where that Officer also had the authority to effect game
changes by the posting of statements identical, or nearly so, to the
statements reporting said fact, could implicitly be equivalent to
that Officer's effecting these game changes. E.g. that "Player X has
committed Infraction Y" could be taken as a Payment Order of Z
Indulgences for Player X. I don't think it's much more outlandish to 
argue that the Chancellor's stating "The Bank has X VTs" might be 
effectively the same as the Chancellor's stating, "H. Assessor and VT 
Recordkeepor, I hereby cause the Bank to hold X VTs".

Just a thought.

That sounds like a reasonable objection...

Really?! I've no memory of such an incident. Roughly when did it happen,
would you say?

I'm quite sure we've been behaving as though they do exist (making
Interested Proposals, paying off Blots).

No, you were right the first time. We jumped from about 100 to about 600
during a CFJ scam similar to what we just saw, only on a bigger scale.
I think TAL might have been the Caller of those CFJs.

But that would also prevent from using the string 'berbiscus', and -
who knows? - I might want to use (or even just mention) that string.
Too strong, and therfore inelegant.

So Norwegian is a tonal language! I didn't know that. Geoff and I were
talking about tonal languages only yesterday. We were wondering: because
English is not tonal, English speakers use tone to convey mood, attitude
and emotion. Doubtless speakers of tonal languages do this also, but
Geoff and I were wondering if the two uses of tone ever interfere with
each other, or whether speakers of tonal languages intuitively partition
the tonal space, using one part for semantic meaning, and the other for
emotional inflection. Or perhaps the truth is stranger still...

Doubtless there have been some. An amnesty is in order, I think.

I think the Chancellor has prepended to all of eir Reports a disclaimer
to the effect that the Transfer Orders named in the Report are
conditional on there being enough of the Currency in the Bank to make
the transfers. I think this rules out the interpretation you're after.

We could, but given that it is possible to recalculate the game state,
game custom seems to be that we try to do that instead.

Well, you could mint some. It would be good of you to do so, actually.

Firstly, I think the real question is: how can the Rule ever *fail*
to act in circumstances in which the conditions of their application
are met? The Rules are always in effect.

Secondly, I completely reject the suggestion that in cases where the
Rules are silent, all arguments are equally good and equally bad. In
my own work as a Judge and Justice, when the Rules are silent I look
for principles derived from the standards set out in R217. A principled
argument is always going to be better than an unprincipled one.

      Whenever there is an entity in Probate which does not have an

They were all based on the newer version of Indulgence Lottery, which actually
failed.  The old version required distribution of Indulgences only when there
were some in the Bank.  So all of those POs were invalid.  I probably will have
to vacate all of them to be accurate, although I would prefer just to consider
them to be something other than a PO.

>And what about the PI Infractions committed by the Bank as a result ?

Since all the POs which would have resulted in those PI Infractions were
invalid, it would not be my intention to ever report them.

That fact, in conjunction with the Judgement of CFJ 944, implies that
the VPs for Proposals 3552-3554 did actually conclude sometime last
Thursday, Oct 2.

What we don't yet know is whether any votes that were cast between
Mon, Sep 22, when the Proposals were distributed, and Sun, Sep 28,
when R693 was disinfected, were legally cast. That question was not
settled by Chuck in his Judgement.

I will do so soon, shortly after I determine the list of all
outstanding and unresolved Payment Orders.  The Bank will have to Mint
them before it can satisfy them, of course, and I see no reason for
the Bank to be dilatory in this regard.  Of course, the Bank would
prefer to wait until the ruling of CFJ 933 is formally promulgated.

Why? The original Judgement of CFJ 933 has long since been promulgated,
and you now know enough to know that that Judgement has been sustained,
and we know that Judgements and Appeals of Judgements don't actually
change the game state but only tell us what it was all along, so why
wait? We've got a backlog of Proposals that Players have been waiting to
submit, and I would have thought that this saga has dragged on long
enough. Time to get on with other things.
