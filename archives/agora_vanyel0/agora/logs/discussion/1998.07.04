I'm being fairly inactive because I've been enjoying my summer 
vacation, but also, I don't really want to spend any VTs without 
either a bribe/compensation or a fairly convincing argument that my 
vote will be worth the VT.

Here's a suggestion: Why doesn't somebody (not me, I don't spend 
enough time on this game) set up a service where, for a small fee, 
they will accept proposals from other players, and when they get a 
certain number they will propose them as a lump and spend the P-Note 
to raise their priority to 1? Another idea would be to accept a flat 
fee from a proposal's author to get a proposal passed or your money 
back (with get-out-the-vote drives, bribes, or whatnot). I'm not sure 
what an appopriate fee would be for these services - probably 1/4 to 
1/2 a P-Note equivalent (exchange rate, anybody?) for the former, and 
3 to 6 VTs for the latter.

On second thought, that later one smells a little much like RL 
politics. After all, in Agora, the true determinant of whether a 
proposal passes should be the will of the majority. Right? :-)

Interestingly enough, R1445 does not place any time limit on when I
make this call. So I guess I have time to hear any offers.. ahem, I mean
arguments from either side. :)
