That is something I could support. Of course, it is also a prime
candiate for failing quorum, because it is a relatively minor fix, so
if I were you, I'd be a little afraid of wasting a P-note on it. Maybe
you could keep this and tie it together with other uncontroversial
proposals?

That's cutting it very fine, Blob. The earliest moment at which
such a declaration can take effect (which will need another post
from you) is 4 days after you mke the original announcement, ie
Sat Jun 27, 19:29 - about 1 hour before the VPs close.

However I wonder if I shouldn't object to this move. I don't
like the Quorum Tools much, and I don't see why Players should
be absolved of their responsibility to vote on Proposals.

I shall have to think about it.

Questionable--e announced that the Proposals had achieved
Quorum.  I do not recall seeing em post an intent to do
anything.
