That would be "aural discretion". :)

This version has a few small changes: 1) I make it perfectly clear
that the Scorekeepor is the only one with any requirement to
report scores; it is optional for all other Players. 2) Small
tweak so the Scorekeepor won't have to keep track of score before
the first Round begins (presumably Mar. 1). 3) A few clarifications
regarding the seedings for the first Round.

Vlad


The following is not a Proposal. My comments are in brackets.

Protoproposal Vlad-GAT v.3:
The Grand Agoran Tournament
This Proposal consists of a number of Proposed Rule Changes, each
marked by *

* 	Create a Rule entitled "The Grand Agoran Tournament" with the
following text:

	The Grand Agoran Tournament consists of a series of Rounds.
These Rounds begin on the First of March, June, September, and October
of each year, and last for three months. The first Round begins March
1, 1999. At the beginning of each Round, the Scorekeepor will draw up
a list of all Active Players in descending order of their Scores from
the preceding Round. For the first Round, this will be done instead in
descending order of the Players' combined P-Note and VT holdings taken
from the most recent Official Reports. Ties will be broken by random
selection. 

	The Scorekeepor will then define a number of Circles among
which the Active Players will be partitioned. These must be as few as
possible, but there is a minimum of three Circles and an initial
maximum of six Players per Circle. They are designated the First
Circle, Second Circle, etc. ... Nth Circle. The First Circle is the
highest ranking Circle, and the Nth Circle is the lowest ranking
Circle.
	 The initial number of spots in each Circle will be the number
of Active Players divided by the number of Circles (FRD). If there are
more Players than spots the Scorekeepor will add one spot to the Nth
Circle, then one to the N-1th Circle, etc. until there are exactly as
many spots as Active Players. The First Circle spots are filled with
the highest ranked Players from the preceding Round (skipping
Inactive Players), and so on down the remainder of the Circles in
order. After the above procedure, if a Player is assigned a Circle
below that of another Player with whom e was tied at the end the last
Round, that Player shall be moved into the same Circle as the Player
with whom e was tied. The initial Score for each Player in each Round
is zero (this last procedure is ignored for the first Round).
	When a Player joins the game e is automatically assigned to
the same Circle e held when e deregistered (if applicable and
possible), or else the lowest Circle. A Player going On Hold is
automatically withdrawn from the current Round of competition. A
Player coming Off Hold is treated as a new Player for the purposes of
this Rule, with an initial Score of zero.

[The Circle system I consider the heart of this Proposal. The
Circle system allows Players to compete against others with a similar
amount of time to devote to the game or of a similar skill level. This
should hopefully increase competitiveness among all Players, not just
those at the top.]

* Add a new Rule entitled "Competitions" with the following text

The Individual Competition
	At the end of each Round the Player with the highest Score in
eir Circle wins that Round for that Circle and receives the
corresponding Scoring Patent Title. Any Player winning eir Circle has
the option of not participating in the Round immediately following. To
exercise this option, the Player must post eir wishes to the Public
Forum within two weeks after the beginning of the Round e is opting
out of. The Player then receives no Score, and is ineligible for SPTs.
The next Round the Scorekeepor shall seed the Player based on the
score that Player received two Rounds previously.

The Team Competition
	The Team Competition runs parallel to and concurrently with
the Individual Competition. A Team consists of a group of Players who
have signed an Application to Form a Team within two weeks of the
beginning of the Round in which they wish to compete. If fewer then
two Teams register for a round, there is no Team Competition that
Round. A Team's Score is the combined Scores of its members. A Team
wins the Team Competition if at the end of that Round its Score is
greater than that of the other registered Teams.

*	Create a Rule entitled "Applications to Form a Team" with the
following text:

There is a type of Application called an Application to Form a Team
(AFT). A valid AFT, in order to have effect upon Execution, must
contain the following:

i)	The name of the proposed Team.
ii)	The Players who will compose the Team, which must include the
Sponsor.
iii)	The Signatures of the Players who will compose the Team.

The Sponsor of an AFT will be known as the Team Captain for the
duration of the Round.

To be valid, an AFT must also fulfill the following conditions:
i)	The proposed Team must consist of at least three Players
ii)	No two proposed Team members may belong to the same Circle.
iii)	No proposed Team Member may belong to an already existing
Team.
If any of the above three conditions ceases to be true, a Team is
immediately dissolved and removed from the current Team Competition.

A valid AFT is Executed by sending it to the Scorekeepor or submitting
it to the Public Forum.

The effect of Execution of an AFT is the entrance of the proposed Team
into the current Team Competition. A Team is automatically dissolved
at the end of the current Round, but may register again in subsequent
Rounds.

An AFT shall only be valid if its contents are not in conflict with
this or other Rules.  An AFT that is not valid shall never be
Executed.

[The Team Competition adds an interesting new dimension, combining
cooperation with competition. The requirement to have the Players come
from different Circles makes all Players desirable to have on one’s
team.]

* 	Create a Rule entitled "The Scorekeepor" with the following
Text:

	There is an Office of Scorekeepor, whose Salary is 1.5 times
the Basic Officer Salary, and whose responsibility it is to keep
accurate track of the current Score of all Players. The Scorekeepor's
Report consists of the Circles of the current Round and the Players in
each Circle, the current Scores of each Player, the changes in Scores
since the last Report and the way those points were earned, the Teams
entered in the current Team Competition, and the current Team Scores
of each Team. The Scorekeepor is only obliged to keep track of scores
and post reports if a Round is currently underway.
	The Scorekeepor is also responsible for posting the final
Scores at the end of each Round, and announcing the SPTs awarded to
the Players that have fulfilled the conditions for receiving them.

Once per Round, no more than two weeks and no less than one week
before the end of the Round, the Scorekeepor may act to change
the Scoring Rule Without 3 Objections. The Scorekeepor may only
propose changes to the basis of Scoring, otherwise the Action
automatically fails. If the action takes effect, the Scoring Rule
is changed appropriately at the beginning of the next Round.

[Basic stuff. Of course, the Scoring Rule can be changed in
conventional ways, but I felt it was good to have a way of easily
making changes between Rounds. Question: Should the Scorekeepor be a
competitor in the GAT?).]

*	Create a Rule entitled "Scoring" with the following text:

 	Players receive Points when certain actions are performed by
them or when certain events occur. This is the only Rule which may
define the methods of Scoring. In general, a Player may receive points
only for actions which occur during the current Round, although those
actions may depend on others which occurred previously (thus, for
example, a Player could gain points for one of eir Proposals passing,
even if the Proposal was distributed before the beginning of the
current Round.). Points are non-transferable.

	In general, a Player may receive points for a certain type of
event any number of times, unless that event has a number (N) after
it, in which case a given Player may be awarded points for that type
of event only N times in a given Round.

	If not otherwise noted, Points awarded for events referring to
"a Player" or "any Player", go to that Player. Bonuses are in addition
to the basic award. Multipliers are in lieu of the basic award.
Bonuses can be multiplied.

Responsibility for detecting changes to a Player's Score from the
following events is the responsibility of the Scorekeepor:

If a Proposal proposed by a Player passes: 5 points for first passing
Proposal by that Player in that Round, 3 for second, 1 for third, 0.5
for fourth and subsequent Proposals, +0.5 if Proposal is a Repeal, +1
if the Proposer does not Vote on the Proposal. Double points if
Proposal passes unanimously. Triple Points if the Player making the
Proposal is the only Entity who votes AGAINST.

To any Player winning a contested Election: 8 points. Double points if
Elected unanimously.

To any Player holding the most of a given currency at the end of a
Round: 8 Points per currency. Tripled if at any point during the Round
a Player had no holdings in that Currency.

To any Player tied for the most of a given currency at the end of a
Round: 5 Points per currency. Tripled if at any point during the Round
a Player had no holdings in that Currency.

To any Player holding no Currency whatsoever at the end of a Round: 5
Points.

To any Player earning no Blots during a Round: 4 Points.

To any Player having no Blots at the end of a Round: 6 Points.

To any Player voting on a Proposal: If the Player casts at least
one vote which is the same as 80% or more of the Votes cast on a
Proposal (including eir own): 1 Point, scored when the Proposal
results are announced..

To any Player voting on a Proposal: If the final tally of Votes
shows the same number of FOR votes as AGAINST votes: 2 Points,
scored when the Proposal results are announced.

To the Player Voting or declaring Presence on all Proposals of a
single distribution: 0.5 Points.


Changes to a Player's score from the following events may be reported
by any Player by notifying the Scorekeepor or posting to the Public
Forum. No Player, however, not even the Scorekeepor, is legally
required to do so.

If a Rule is created containing a Player's name in the text: 15
Points.

If a Player gains a Patent Title (other than SPTs or Degrees): 4
Points (1).

To any Player receiving a Degree: 4 Points for am A.N., 6 points for a
B.N., 8 Points for a M.N., and 12 Points for a D.N.Phil or a D.N.Hist.

If a Proposal made by a Player successfully creates a Rule with a
number that is a multiple of 23: 4 Points.

If a Player submits a Proposal to the Queue that is subsequently
discarded: 5 Points (1).

To any Player Proposing an Insane Proposal for which no Entity votes
FOR: 30 Points.

To any Player who is chided for posting a single document that is not
an Official Report to a forum other than the Public Forum by more than
one Player (other than themselves): 2 Points (1).

To the third Player other than the Poster making substantive comments
to a protoproposal: 1 Point (3).

To the Player making a COE that is Responded to and admitted by the
relevant Officer (other than themselves): 1 Point (1).

To the Player Holding an Office for at least one month during the
Round, and issuing at least one Official Report: 2 Points (1)

To the Player making a Sane Proposal for which a Non-Player Voting
Entity successfully Votes: 15 points (1).

To the Player making a Senate Proposal for which a non-Senator
successfully Votes: 25 points (1).

To any Player submitting a Judgment for a CFJ which is not Appealed
before the end of the Round: 1 point.

To the Player making a CFJ which is not Judged for one month from its
original assignment: 8 Points (1 per Player per CFJ).

When an Appeal successfully overturns a Judgment, to the Players
calling for that Appeal: 2 Points

When an Appeal fails to overturn a Judgment, to the Judge who made the
original Judgment on that CFJ: 4 Points.

If three consecutive CFJs are Judged TRUE, FALSE and UNDECIDED (in any
order), to the Player making the third CFJ: 17 Points.

When a Player is Deregistered due to Silence, to the Player last
making em Silent: 5 Points.

To the Player successfully Calling for a Revolt: 15 Points.


[Any scoring system, both in the assignment of point values to actions
and in the selection of actions themselves will be arbitrary. I sought
to have a large number of scoring actions, of various levels of
difficulty. I am open to suggestions for other scoring methods.]

*	Create a Rule entitled "Scoring Patent Titles" with the
following Text:

	Scoring Patent Titles (SPTs) are a subclass of Patent Titles.
They are identical to Patent Titles except that they are automatically
revoked at the end of the Round subsequent to the one for which they
were awarded. The valid SPTs, and the circumstances for which they are
awarded, are as follows:

For winning an Individual Competition in the Nth Circle, a Player
receives the SPT of 'Victor of the Nth Circle' (where Nth is replaced
by the ordinal corresponding to eir Circle number). If a Player wins
the same Circle two Rounds in succession e receives instead the SPT of
'Double Victor of the Nth Circle', for three consecutive Rounds
'Triple Victor of the Nth Circle', etc.

If two or more Players within a Circle are tied for the highest score
in a Circle at the end of a Round, they receive the SPT of
'Pseudo-Victor Nth Circle' (where Nth is replaced by the ordinal
corresponding to eir Circle number).

For being a member of a Team winning the Team Competition, a Player
receives the SPT of 'Team Victor', except for the Team Captain who
receives the SPT of "Victorious Leader"

If two or more Teams are tied for the highest Team Score at the end
of a Round, their members receive the SPT of 'Pseudo-Team Victor'

If a Player Scores enough in a Round that e would have won at least
one of the Circles higher than that in which e competed, e receives
the SPT of 'Overachiever'.

If a Player Scores so low that e would have placed last in at least
one of the Circles below eir own e receives the SPT of 'Slacker'.

[This replaces the current Champion PTs]

* Rule 755 'Champions' is hereby Repealed.

* Rule 1465 'Champion's Reward' is hereby Repealed.

* Rule 1498 'Winning by Blots' is hereby Repealed.

* Rule 1580 'Multiple Winners of a Single Game' is hereby Repealed.

* Rule 1622 'Forfeiting the Game' is hereby Repealed.

* Rule 1697 'Multiple rapid wins prohibited' is hereby Repealed.

[Clearing out the detritus of the old system. 112 is left alone for
now since repealing it now would give this Proposal an AI of 3. I
think it is best if 1638 stay as long as 112 is still on the books,
although it is irrelvant to the GAT.]

* Amend Rule 1435  'Definition of Indulgences, Blots and Immaculate'
by removing the last sentence "It is a Win-Preventing condition for a
Player to have one or more Blots."

* Amend Rule 1729 'Insanity' by replacing the last two lines with:

And should it occur (oh, need I say more?)
that no one Votes FOR it, the Proposer shall Score.

[Needed to complete the installation of the new system.]

Excuse #1: we're busy reading the Ruleset.

Excuse #2: those of us in FRC are spending a lot of time keeping up over
there.  This round just exploded out of nowhere!  After numerous rounds
in the 4-8 Rules range, we've had 21 in just the first few days of this
round!

Protoproposal Chaos99 [rev. 1]

Reformat Rule 1431

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1431 be amended to read:

      (a) A Claim of Error is a message posted to the Public Forum to
          the effect that a specific post to the Public Forum
          misrepresents the actual Game State, and documenting the
          nature of the error.

      (b) A Response to a Claim of Error consists in posting to the
          Public Forum either a denial of the Claim or an admission of
          the Claim. If the Claim is admitted, then the Player making
          the admission is required to post a corrected version of the
          relevant portion of the message which was in error, before
          one week passes from the time the Claim of Error was made. A
          Player who admits a Claim but does not publish a correction
          is deemed not to have Responded to that Claim.

      (c) A Response must be provided by the Player who is required by
          the Rules to publish the information subject to a Claim
          within one week of the Claim being made, unless any of the
          following holds:
        (1) a previous Claim was made concerning the same error;
        (2) the message claimed to be in error was posted more than 21
            days before the claim was made; or
        (3) another message by the Player in error has corrected the
            error

      (d) A Player who fails to post a Response within the alloted
          time commits the Infraction of Delayed COE Response,
          carrying a penalty of 1 Blot, to be reported by the Player
          who posted the Claim. A Player who incorrectly issues a
          denial of a Claim commits the Crime of Wrongful COE Denial,
          a Class 1 Crime, unless e then admits the Claim within 72
          hours after the incorrect denial.

          is one which may legally be Ratified.

      (c) A COE on any Report undergoing this process shall be deemed

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1552 be amended to read:

      (a) In order for an Official Document to be valid for the
          purpose of a Ratification, it must satisfy all the following
          criteria at the time the Proposal which would Ratify it is
          Proposed:
        (1) the Rules require some specific Player to produce and/or
            maintain the Document;
        (2) the Rules require the Document to be published in the
            Public Forum or otherwise distributed to all Players;
        (3) the Document is not currently subject to a Claim of Error
            (COE);
        (4) the Document is not currently the subject of a pending
            Call for Judgement (CFJ) or Appeal of a CFJ;
        (5) the information within the Document has not been
            superseded by a subsequent Document; and
        (6) the Document is not the Ruleset.

      (b) Further, a Document can become invalid for the purpose of
          Ratification if, during the Voting Period of a Proposal
          which would Ratify it, any of the following occurs:
        (1) the Document is superseded by a subsequent Document which
            contradicts the information in the prior Document, unless
            the superseding document is itself corrected such that no
            contradiction exists, prior to the end of the Voting
            Period of the Proposal to Ratify; or
        (2) The Document becomes the subject of a pending CFJ or a
            pending appeal of a CFJ.

      (c) The validity for Ratification of a Document is not affected
          if, during the Voting Period of a Proposal to Ratify a
          Document, another Document is issued that does not
          contradict the prior Document.
