Protoproposal Chaos78 [rev. 5]

Summary Adoption

Be it resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 3, to read:

      (a) The Proposer of any Proposal may cause it to be Adopted
          Without Objection, but only if the Proposal has not yet been
          distributed.

      (b) A Proposal Adopted Without Objection is Adopted at the time
          its Proposer changes its status to Adopted in accordance
          with the procedure for performing changes Without Objection,
          but only if at that time that Proposal has not yet been
          distributed.

      (c) When a Proposal is Adopted Without Objection, it is removed
          from the Queue.

      (d) A Proposal Adopted Without Objection is considered to be
          Disinterested.

      (e) This Rule takes precedence over:
        (1) any Rule which would prevent a Proposal from being Adopted
            Without Objection;
        (2) any Rule which would prevent a Proposal Adopted Without
            Objection from being removed from the Proposal Queue; and
        (3) any Rule which would prevent a Proposal Adopted Without
            Objection from being considered Disinterested.

Judicial Reform of 1998

Be it resolved, that Rule 991 be amended to read:

      (a) Any person who believes that the Rules have not been
          followed in any way may submit a Call for Judgement (CFJ) to
          rectify the violation. A person who submits a CFJ is known
          as its Caller.

      (b) A CFJ shall identify the Player or Players (Respondents) who
          have failed to follow the Rules, and shall contain a short
          statement of the facts which surround the alleged violation
          of the Rules, a statement of the relief which the Caller is
          seeking, and an argument explaining the legal basis for the
          relief to be sought. The Caller may include any other
          material or information e feels is pertinent.

      (c) Upon the receipt of a CFJ, the Clerk of the Courts shall:
        (1) assign, according to the procedures defined elsewhere, a
            Player to shall serve as the Judge of that CFJ; and
        (2) publish a Notice of Call for Judgement, which shall
            include everything submitted in the CFJ by the Caller and
            the identity of the Player selected under subdivision
            (c)(1) above.

      (d) The Clerk of the Courts shall develop and utilize a system
          of numbering or otherwise identifying CFJs such that Players
          may readily and unambiguously refer to any individual CFJ
          without undue difficulty or confusion.

Be it further resolved, that Rules 897, 1562 and 1563 be repealed.

Protoproposal Chaos71 [rev. 4]

Make the Proposal Queue More Competitive  

Be it resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) The Proposal Tariff is a number of P-Notes (which must be a
          multiple of the MUQ for P-Notes), greater than 0 and not
          more than 2.

      (b) The value of the Proposal Tariff, upon the adoption of the
          Proposal which created this Rule, is 1.

      (c) The Promotor may change the value of the Proposal Tariff by
          announcing its new value in the Public Forum, provided that
          the new value is within the range allowed by subdivision (a)
          of this Rule.

      (d) Whenever a new value is announced according to subdivision
          (c) of this Rule, the new value takes effect at the
          beginning of the next Nomic Week, unless the announcement is
          made within three days of the end of the current Nomic Week,
          in which case the new value takes effect at the beginning of
          the Nomic Week following the next Nomic Week.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1771 be amended to read:

      A Player may increase or decrease the Priority of a Proposal in
      the Queue by announcing to the Public Forum that e does so, and
      paying a number of P-Notes to the Bank. For each multiple of the
      Proposal Tariff e pays to the Bank, the Priority of the Proposal
      is increased or decreased by one, as specified by the Player
      making the payment, provided that this transfer is not executed
      for any other purpose.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1701 be amended, by replacing "is 1"
with "is 0.01".

Well, in that case, they aren't the trivial but worthy changes which
Blob wants to see adopted Summarily.

If ten's your limit, by all means let's take them ten at a time.

Why not amend the rule so that it only applies to "trivial" amendments 
and not other types of proposal?

Well, I don't see the need, since I'm perfectly happy with the rule as
it is, and it won't solve Steve's objection either, since he doesn't want
_any_ proposals, trivial or no, to be adopted in this way.

The problem arises in defining what is "trivial". The nice thing about
the Without Objection mechanism is that it leaves this question to the
people best placed to judge it - the potential Objectors.

Satisfying Payment Orders

Be it resolved, that Rule 1732 be amended to read:

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 1, to read:

      (a) A Payment Order is satisfied when a number of units of
          Currency equal in number and kind to that named in the
          Payment Order are successfully transferred to the payee
          named in the Payment Order, provided also that:
        (1) the Executor of the Transfer Order which effected that
            transfer clearly indicated at the time e executed the
            Transfer Order that the transfer was being made for the
            purpose of satisfying that Payment Order; and
        (2) the transfer was not made for any other purpose.

      (b) A Payment Order may be satisfied at most once, and a vacated
          Payment Order may not be satisfied after being vacated.

Protoproposal Chaos43 [rev. 9]

Unlimited Voting

Be it resolved, that Rule 206 be amended to read:

      (a) A Voting Entity is an Entity which is generally authorized
          by the Rules to cast a vote or votes on a Proposal.  Other
          Rules may withdraw this authorization from a Voting Entity
          in specific circumstances without that Entity thereby
          ceasing to be a Voting Entity.  Only those Entities
          designated by the Rules to be Voting Entities are Voting
          Entities.

      (b) No Entity is permitted to vote on a Proposal unless it is a
          Voting Entity.

      (c) Players and Groups are Voting Entities.

      (d) Unless otherwise specified, each Voting Entity may cast an
          unlimited number of Votes on a Proposal.

Be it further resolved, that Rules 1660, 1765 and 1465 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1442 be amended, by appending a
paragraph reading, "If the voting cost for a Proposal is zero, then
each Voting Entity may cast only one Vote on that Proposal."

Categorical Redundance?

Be it resolved, that Rules 1048 and 1691 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 1, to read:

      (a) A new Rule shall be assigned to:
        (1) the Rule Category specified by the Instrument that created
            the Rule, if that Rule Category exists; otherwise
        (2) a Rule Category chosen by the Rulekeepor at eir
            discretion, by Public Forum Announcement.

      (b) The Rulekeepor may create a new Rule Category at eir
          discretion, by Public Forum Announcement.

      (c) The Rulekeepor may delete an empty Rule Category at eir
          discretion, by Public Forum Announcement.

      (d) The Rulekeepor may change the name of a Rule Category
          Without Objection.

      (e) The Rulekeepor may change the Rule Category to which a given
          Rule is assigned Without Objection.

[ Comment: Rules 1691 and 1048 are somewhat redundant in their present
  form.  This proto seeks to eliminate the redundancy and clean up
  things a bit. ]

Some Housecleaning

Be it resolved, that Rule 408 be amended to read:

      (a) The Judge of an open CFJ is required to, within seven days
          of when that CFJ last became open or seven days of eir
          assignment to that CFJ, whichever is later, close that CFJ
          by dismissing or judging the CFJ and/or granting or denying
          any outstanding judicial motions pertaining to that CFJ.

      (b) The failure of a Judge to close a case within the prescribed
          time constitutes the Infraction of Judicial Tardiness and
          carries a penalty of one Blot for each day (or fraction
          thereof) that the case remains open beyond the permitted
          time.  This penalty is to be reported by the Clerk of the
          Courts.

      (c) The failure to observe this time limit does not, by itself,
          cause the delinquent Judge to be recused from the CFJ, nor
          does it invalidate eir judgment or dismissal of the CFJ or
          grant or denial of any related judicial motion which that
          Judge might submit after the limit has expired.

      (d) This Rule defers to any other Rule which prescribes a
          different time limit in which a CFJ must be closed, and to
          any other Rule which establishes procedures by which the
          time limit specified in this Rule may be extended or
          shortened.

Eliminate ASAP I

Be it resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Whenever the Rules require a Player to perform some duty
          after the occurence of an event, and specifies a time limit
          for doing so, the failure of that Player to perform the duty
          within that time limit in no way abates that Player's
          obligation to perform that duty, unless the Rule which
          imposes that obligation specifies otherwise.

      (b) Whenever the Rules require a Player to perform some duty at
          least once within any given time interval (such as once each
          week, or each month), and that Player fails to do so, e is
          not obligated to do so twice during the next such time
          period, unless the Rule which imposes that obligation
          specifies otherwise.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 208 be amended to read:

      (a) The Assessor shall publish all the Votes cast upon a
          Proposal within seven days of the end of that Proposal's
          Voting Period.

      (b) The Assessor shall not publish the Votes cast on a Proposal
          prior to the time e publishes the Votes cast on:
        (1) all Proposals whose Voting Periods ended before that of
            the Proposal in question, and
        (2) all Proposals whose Voting Periods ended at the same time
            as the Proposal in question and which have a lower number.

I'd like to wish all my fellow Agorans a very merry April Fool's Day,
and remind them that today is a Holiday, in accordance with R1787, whose
text it seems worth quoting in full:

Rule 1787/0 (Power=1)
April Fool's Day

      A break from all the stress and strife
         and matters of much gravity,
      is what this Nomic sorely needs:
         a dithyramb to levity!

      In order that, just once a year,
         our hearts be light and gay,
      Let April Fool's Day, every year
         become a Holiday!



In honour of the occasion, I offer the following scandalous ditty, to be
sung in rousing and rowdy choruses amidst the clanking of beer steins:

      "Oh, the General's a rude bastard
           and Steve's a stubborn jerk,
       They both play too much Nomic
           and ne'er do any work.

       They act like politicians
           whose weaknesses they ape
       and quarrel like old women
           till Blob gets out of shape.

       CHORUS

       We bother, fuss and argue,
           it's crazy and inane
       It's comic and it's Nomic
           and at least it's just a game!


{further verses to be drunkenly ad libbed as fancy strikes you}

Appeal Tweaks

Be it resolved, that Rule 1570 be amended to read:

      (a) As soon as possible after an Application for Appeal of a
          Judgement or Motion has been executed, the Clerk of the
          Court shall:
        (1) assign, according to the procedures defined elsewhere,
            three Players to serve as the Board of Appeal for that
            Appeal; and
        (2) publish a Notice of Appeal identifying the Judgement or
            Motion being Appealed, and the identity of the three
            Players selected under subparagraph (a)(1) above.

      (b) The Clerk of the Courts shall develop and utilize a system
          of numbering or otherwise identifying Calls for Appeals such
          that Players may readily and unambiguously refer to any
          individual Appeal without undue difficulty or confusion.

      (c) If the Clerk of the Courts is in doubt as to whether an
          Application for Appeal has been successfully executed, e
          shall proceed as if it had been successfully executed,
          reserving the question of successful execution to the Board
          of Appeals.

      (d) If the Board of Appeals finds that the Application for
          Appeal which led to the appointment of that Board was not
          successfully executed, it may (at its discretion) dismiss
          the Appeal, without making any ruling on the merits of the
          Appeal.

Be it resolved, that Rules 1841 and 1842 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 1, to read:

      (a) A Player (hereinafter, the Grantee) who lawfully holds a
          grant of Power of Attorney for another Player (hereinafter
          the Grantor) is, for the duration of that grant, the
          Executor of the Grantor, and may act in the Grantor's behalf
          for as long as the Grantee lawfully holds the Power of
          Attorney. However, this power to act on the Grantor's behalf
          shall not extend to the performance of any privilege, duty,
          or power of any Office held by the Grantee.

      (b) Power of Attorney is granted by Public Forum Announcement. 
          The announcement shall be posted by the Grantor and shall
          set forth:
        (1) the name of the Grantee; and
        (2) the dates upon which the grant shall begin and end.

      (c) A Player may grant Power of Attorney to another Player only
          if:
        (1) the Grantor has been continuously registered for the two
            months immediately prior to the announcement;
        (2) the Grantee is a Player and is not on Hold at the time of
            the announcement;
        (3) the grant is to begin within one week of the time of the
            announcement;
        (4) the grant is to end within three months of the time of the
            announcement;
        (5) the Grantee holds a grant of Power of Attorney for at most
            one other Player at the time of the announcement; and
        (6) the Grantee has not granted Power of Attorney to anyone
            else.

      (d) A grant is terminated if:
        (1) the Grantee ceases to be a Player or goes on Hold;
        (2) the Grantor ceases to be a Player;
        (3) the Grantee fails to consent, by Public Forum
            Announcement, to the grant before the time the grant
            begins;
        (4) the grant's specified period expires;
        (5) the Grantee grants Power of Attorney to anyone else; or
        (6) the Grantor cancels the grant, by Public Forum
            Announcement.

      (e) For the purpose of subdivision (a), the term "privilege,
          duty, or power of any Office" includes those of the Speaker,
          and those of a Judge or Justice, with respect to a Grantor
          who holds any of these positions.

Protoproposal Chaos233 [rev. 3]

Merit

Be it resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Each Player has a Merit Rating, an integer, which may be
          positive, negative, or zero.  Until the Rules act to give a
          Player some other Merit Rating, a Player's Merit Rating is
|         zero. Merit Ratings shall be changed only when authorized by
|         the Rules.

      (b) The Office of the Secretary is hereby established.
        (1) The Secretary shall maintain a record of the Merit Rating
            of every Player.
        (2) The Secretary's Report shall include:
          (A) a schedule setting forth the Merit Rating of each
              Player; and
          (B) a description of all changes made to the Merit Rating of
              any Player since the last such Report.
        (3) The Secretary shall receive a salary equal to one and
            one-half times the Basic Officer Salary.

      (c) When an entitlement is to be randomly distributed to the
          Players, the Officer making the distribution shall use the
          following procedure (or any other procedure which results in
          each Player having the same probability of receiving the
          entitlement as e would under the following procedure):
        (1) The Officer shall, for each Player, place in a bin one
            hundred tokens bearing the name of that Player, in each
            case augmenting or diminishing that number by that
|           Player's Merit Rating. (If a Player's Merit Rating is less
|           than negative one hundred, then no tokens are placed in
|           the bin.)
        (2) The Officer shall then draw one token from the bin, and
            award the entitlement to the Player whose name is on the
            token.

      (d) When making a distribution the procedure described in
          subdivision (c), the Officer shall use the Merit Ratings of
          the Players reported in the most recent uncontested
          Secretary's Report, and no other.  A distribution made based
          on Merit Ratings as required by this subdivision is valid
          notwithstanding any error in the Secretary's Report which
          may later become apparent.
        (1) If the most recent uncontested Secretary's Report is more
            than twenty-one days old, the Officer may elect to delay
            the distribution until a new Report is made.  If the
            Officer elects to delay a distribution, e must announce in
            the Public Forum that e has elected to do so.
        (2) If there has never been an uncontested Secretary's Report,
            the Officer shall proceed on the assumption that every
            Player has a Merit Rating of zero.

            time within the last three months, and the changes thereof
            since the last posting of the Herald's Report, including
            the reason for such change provided by the Player which
            initiated it, if any.
        (2) The Currency Records for Indulgences.
        (3) A list of all Fugitives from Justice, and the number of

          Player to another (thereby reducing the Honour of the first
          by one, and increasing the Honour of the second by one), by
          Public Forum Announcement, provided the following conditions
          hold:
        (1) the Player whose Honour is to be increased is not the
            Player causing the changes;
        (2) the Player whose Honour is to be decreased has at least
            one Kudo;
        (3) the Player causing the transfer has neither transferred a
            Kudo away from the Player whose Honour is to be reduced,

            Herald; and
        (2) the announcement sets forth a reason for the award.

      (c) This Rule does not in any way prohibit other Rules from
          defining other means by which a Player's Honour may be
          changed.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) A Samurai is a Player whose Honor is more than thirty Kudos.

      (b) Whenever a Player is a Samurai, that Player has at least as
          much Honor as every other Player, and that Player does not
          already hold the Patent Title of Shogun, that Player is
          automatically awarded the Patent Title of Shogun.

      (c) The Patent Title of Shogun is revoked automatically from any
          Player who holds it if e ceases to be a Samurai.

      (d) Thie Patent Title of Shogun shall not be awarded or revoked
          except as specified in this Rule; this Rule takes precedence
          over any Rule which would permit otherwise.

      (e) The Herald shall announce in the Public Forum whenever a
          Player receives or loses the Patent Title of Shogun, as soon
          as possible after such award or revocation occurs.

Protoproposal Chaos72 [rev. 7]

Simplify Probate

| Be it resolved, that Rules 1738, 1739 and 1757 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1601 be amended to read:

|     (a) An entity is disempowered if it does not have an Executor. A
|         Payment Order naming a disempowered entity as payor is a
|         debt of that entity.

|     (b) The Notary may, with respect to a disempowered entity,
|         transfer Currencies owned by the disempowered entity:
|       (1) to any entity named as a payee of a debt of the
|           disempowered entity; or
|       (2) to any entity, consistent with the established Will of the
|           disempowered entity, provided that there are no debts of
|           the disempowered entity in the Currency to be transferred.

|     (c) The transfer of currencies under subdivision (b)(2) is
|         subject to judicial review. Upon a judicial finding that a
|         transfer made under subdivision (b)(2) was not permitted by
|         that subdivision or was inconsistent with the established
|         Will of that entity, the Judge of the CFJ making that
|         finding shall vacate the affected transfer.
| 
|     (d) In addition, the Notary may, with respect to any dissolute
|         entity and Without Objection:
|       (1) vacate any Payment Order naming the disempowered entity as
|           payor or payee; or
|       (2) transfer any or all Currencies owned by that entity to the
|           Bank.
| 
|     (e) A disempowered entity is considered to continue to have
          legal existence as long as it continues to possess units of
          Currency or is named as the payor or payee of a Payment
          Order, even if it would otherwise be dissolved or destroyed,
          or otherwise cease to have legal existence, prior to that
|         time. The Notary shall make a diligent and good faith effort
|         to dispose of the Currencies and Payment Orders of any
|         dissolute entity, subject to the conditions of this Rule.

|     (f) This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would impair
          the Notary in the exercise of the powers granted in
|         subdivisions (b) and (d) of this Rule.
| 
| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1637 be amended to read:
| 
|     (b) A Will is a document specifying how the Notary is to be
|         instructed to dispose of the Currencies possessed by an
|         entity in the event that entity becomes disempowered.
| 
|     (c) A Will is established by the Execution of an Application to
|         Establish a Will.
| 
|     (d) An Application to Establish a Will must set forth the Will
|         to be established and the entity for which the Will is to be
|         established, and be signed by by the Executor of that
|         entity.
| 
|     (e) An Application to Establish a Will is executed by submitting
|         it to the Notary.
| 
|     (f) The effect of Executing an Application to Establish a Will
|         is to establish the Will contained within the Application
|         for the entity named by the Application. The establishment
|         of a Will for an entity renders void any previous Will
|         established for that entity.

Esthetic Scoring

Be it resolved, that Rules 1729, 1875, 1876, 1877, 1878, 1879 and 1880
be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 1, to read:

      (b) The Grand Agoran Tournament consists of a series of Rounds.
          These Rounds begin on the First of March, June, September,
          and October of each year, and last for three months. The
          first Round begins March 1, 1999.

      (c) At the beginning of each Round, the Scorekeepor will draw up
          a list of all Active Players.
        (1) For the first Round, this list will be in descending order
            of combined P-Note and VT holdings, as taken from the most
            recent Official Reports.
        (3) For subsequent Rounds, this list will be in descending
            order of their Scores from the preceding Round.
        (5) Ties will be broken by random selection.

      (d) The Scorekeepor will then determine the number of Circles
          among which the Active Players will be partitioned. This
          selection shall be the least number such that:
        (1) there is at least one Circle for each six Active Players,
            and
        (2) there are at least three Circles.
          These Circles are designated, in descending order of rank,
          as the First Circle, the Second Circle, and so forth.

      (f) The Scorekeepor shall then assign the Players on eir list to
          the Circles, ensuring that the following conditions are met:
        (1) no Circle shall have more Players assigned to it than any
            other Circle of lower Rank;
        (2) the difference between the number of Players assigned to
            any two Circles shall not exceed one; and
        (3) no Player shall be placed in a Circle of higher rank than
            that of any Player who appeared before em on the
            Scorekeepor's list.

      (g) Except in the first Round, if two or more Players who were
          tied at the end of the previous Round are placed in
          different Circles, the Scorekeepor shall reassign all of
          those Players to the highest Circle to which any of those
          Players was assigned in accordance with subdivision (f) of
          this Rule.

      (h) At the start of each Round, the score of every Player is set
          to zero.

      (i) When a Player registers or comes Off Hold, eir Score is set
          to zero, and e is assigned to the same Circle in which e was
          in when e most recently deregistered or went On Hold (as
          appropriate), if e deregistered or went On Hold during the
          same Round; or the lowest ranking Circle otherwise.

      (j) A Player who goes On Hold is automatically withdrawn from
          the current Round of competition.

      (k) At the end of each Round each Player with the highest Score
          in eir Circle wins that Round for that Circle and receives
          the corresponding Scoring Patent Title.

      (l) Any Player winning eir Circle has the option of not
          participating in the Round immediately following. To
          exercise this option, the Player must post eir wishes to the
          Public Forum within two weeks after the beginning of the
          Round e is opting out of. A Player who opts out in this
          manner is ineligible for SPTs in that Round, and, for the
          purpose of subdivision (c) in the Round following, has a
          Score in that Round equal to that which e had in the
          previous Round.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 1, to read:

      (a) A Team consists of a group of Players who have signed an
          Application to Form a Team within two weeks of the beginning
          of the Round in which they wish to compete.

      (b) A Team's Score is the combined Scores of its members.

      (c) A Team wins the Team Competition if at the end of that Round
          its Score is greater than that of all other registered
          Teams.

      (d) If a Team is formed and persists to the end of the Round
          without being dissolved, the Scorekeepor shall pay out 2 VTs
          to each member of that Team.

      (e) If fewer then two Teams register for a round, there is no
          Team Competition that Round.

      (f) There is a type of Application called an Application to Form
          a Team (AFT). A valid AFT, in order to have effect upon
          Execution, must:
        (1) specify the name of the proposed Team;
        (2) specify the Players who will compose the Team, subject to
            the following:
          (A) there must be at least three Players;
          (B) no two of the Players named may belong to the same
              Circle; and
          (C) none of the Players may belong to an already-existing
              team;
            be signed by all of the Players specified by it as Players
            of the proposed Team; and
        (3) its Sponsor must be one the Players specified as a
            proposed Team member.

      (g) The Sponsor of an AFT will be known as the Team Captain of
          that Team for the duration of the Round.

      (h) A Team is dissolved when:
        (1) it ceases to have as Members at least three Players; or
        (2) the Round ends.

      (i) A valid AFT is Executed by sending it to the Scorekeepor or
          submitting it to the Public Forum.

      (j) The effect of Execution of a valid AFT is the entrance of
          the proposed Team into the current Team Competition.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 1, to read:

      (a) There is an Office of Scorekeepor, whose Salary is 1.5 times
          the Basic Officer Salary, and whose responsibility it is to
          keep accurate track of the current Score of all Players. The
          Scorekeepor's Report consists of the Circles of the current
          Round and the Players in each Circle, the current Scores of
          each Player, the changes in Scores since the last Report and
          the way those points were earned, the Teams entered in the
          current Team Competition, and the current Team Scores of
          each Team. The Scorekeepor is only obliged to keep track of
          scores and post reports if a Round is currently underway.

      (b) The Scorekeepor is also responsible for posting the final
          Scores at the end of each Round, and announcing the SPTs
          awarded to the Players that have fulfilled the conditions
          for receiving them.

      (c) Once per Round, no more than two weeks and no less than one
          week before the end of the Round, the Scorekeepor may act to
          change the Scoring Rule Without 3 Objections. The
          Scorekeepor may only propose changes to the basis of
          Scoring, otherwise the Action automatically fails. If the
          action takes effect, the Scoring Rule is changed
          appropriately at the beginning of the next Round.

      (d) Players receive Points when certain actions are performed by
          them or when certain events occur. This is the only Rule
          which may define the methods of Scoring. In general, a
          Player may receive points only for actions which occur
          during the current Round, although those actions may depend
          on others which occurred previously (thus, for example, a
          Player could gain points for one of eir Proposals passing,
          even if the Proposal was distributed before the beginning of
          the current Round.). Points are non-transferable.

      (e) In general, a Player may receive points for a certain type
          of event any number of times, unless that event has a number
          (N) after it, in which case a given Player may be awarded
          points for that type of event only N times in a given Round.

      (f) If not otherwise noted, Points awarded for events referring
          to "a Player" or "any Player", go to that Player. Bonuses
          are in addition to the basic award. Multipliers are in lieu
          of the basic award. Bonuses can be multiplied.

      (g) Responsibility for detecting changes to a Player's Score
          from the following events is the responsibility of the
          Scorekeepor:
        (1) If a Proposal proposed by a Player passes: 5 points for
            first passing Proposal by that Player in that Round, 3 for
            second, 1 for third, 0.5 for fourth and subsequent
            Proposals, +0.5 if Proposal is a Repeal, +1 if the
            Proposer does not Vote on the Proposal. Double points if
            Proposal passes unanimously. Triple Points if the Player
            making the Proposal is the only Entity who votes AGAINST.
        (2) To any Player winning a contested Election: 8 points.
            Double points if Elected unanimously.
        (3) To any Player holding the most of a given currency at the
            end of a Round: 8 Points per currency. Tripled if at any
            point during the Round a Player had no holdings in that
            Currency.
        (4) To any Player tied for the most of a given currency at the
            end of a Round: 5 Points per currency. Tripled if at any
            point during the Round a Player had no holdings in that
            Currency.
        (5) To any Player holding no Currency whatsoever at the end of
            a Round: 5 Points.
        (6) To any Player earning no Blots during a Round: 4 Points.
        (7) To any Player having no Blots at the end of a Round: 6
            Points.
        (8) To any Player voting on a Proposal: If the Player casts at
            least one vote which is the same as 80% or more of the
            Votes cast on a Proposal (including eir own): 1 Point,
            scored when the Proposal results are announced.
        (9) To any Player voting on a Proposal: If the final tally of
            Votes shows the same number of FOR votes as AGAINST votes:
            2 Points, scored when the Proposal results are announced.
       (10) To the Player Voting or declaring Presence on all
            Proposals of a single distribution: 0.5 Points.

      (h) Changes to a Player's score from the following events may be
          reported by any Player by notifying the Scorekeepor or
          posting to the Public Forum. No Player, however, not even
          the Scorekeepor, is legally required to do so.
        (1) If a Rule is created containing a Player's name in the
            text: 15 Points.
        (2) If a Player gains a Patent Title (other than SPTs or
            Degrees): 4 Points (1).
        (3) To any Player receiving a Degree: 4 Points for am A.N., 6
            points for a B.N., 8 Points for a M.N., and 12 Points for
            a D.N.Phil or a D.N.Hist.
        (4) If a Proposal made by a Player successfully creates a Rule
            with a number that is a multiple of 23: 4 Points.
        (5) If a Player submits a Proposal to the Queue that is
            subsequently discarded: 5 Points (1).
        (6) To any Player Proposing an Insane Proposal for which no
            Entity votes FOR: 30 Points.
        (7) To any Player who is chided for posting a single document
            that is not an Official Report to a forum other than the
            Public Forum by more than one Player (other than
            themselves): 2 Points (1).
        (8) To the third Player other than the Poster making
            substantive comments to a protoproposal: 1 Point (3).
        (9) To the Player making a COE that is Responded to and
            admitted by the relevant Officer (other than themselves):
            1 Point (1).
       (10) To the Player Holding an Office for at least one month

            Non-Player Voting Entity successfully Votes: 15 points
            (1).
       (12) To the Player making a Senate Proposal for which a
            non-Senator successfully Votes: 25 points (1).
       (13) To any Player submitting a Judgment for a CFJ which is not
            Appealed before the end of the Round: 1 point.
       (14) To the Player making a CFJ which is not Judged for one
            month from its original assignment: 8 Points (1 per Player
            per CFJ).
       (15) When an Appeal successfully overturns a Judgment, to the
            Players calling for that Appeal: 2 Points
       (16) When an Appeal fails to overturn a Judgment, to the Judge
            who made the original Judgment on that CFJ: 4 Points.
       (17) If three consecutive CFJs are Judged TRUE, FALSE and
            UNDECIDED (in any order), to the Player making the third
            CFJ: 17 Points.

            Player last making em Silent: 5 Points.
       (19) To the Player successfully Calling for a Revolt: 15
            Points.

      (i) Scoring Patent Titles (SPTs) are a subclass of Patent
          Titles. They are identical to Patent Titles except that they
          are automatically revoked at the end of the Round subsequent
          to the one for which they were awarded. The valid SPTs, and
          the circumstances for which they are awarded, are as
          follows:
        (1) For winning an Individual Competition in the Nth Circle, a
            Player receives the SPT of 'Victor of the Nth Circle'
            (where Nth is replaced by the ordinal corresponding to eir
            Circle number). If a Player wins the same Circle two
            Rounds in succession e receives instead the SPT of 'Double
            Victor of the Nth Circle', for three consecutive Rounds
            'Triple Victor of the Nth Circle', etc.
        (2) If two or more Players within a Circle are tied for the
            highest score in a Circle at the end of a Round, they
            receive the SPT of 'Pseudo-Victor of the Nth Circle'
            (where Nth is replaced by the ordinal corresponding to eir
            Circle number).
        (3) For being a member of a Team winning the Team Competition,
            a Player receives the SPT of 'Team Victor', except for the
            Team Captain who receives the SPT of "Victorious Leader"
        (4) If two or more Teams are tied for the highest Team Score
            at the end of a Round, their members receive the SPT of
            'Team Pseudo-Victor'
        (5) If a Player Scores enough in a Round that e would have won
            at least one of the Circles higher than that in which e
            competed, e receives the SPT of 'Overachiever'.
        (6) If a Player Scores so low that e would have placed last in
            at least one of the Circles below eir own e receives the
            SPT of 'Slacker'.

Protoproposal Chaos229 [rev. 1]

Clear the Slate

Be it resolved, that Rules 1730, 1713, 1732, 1734, 1852, 1735, 1853,
1637, 1817, 1818, 1873, 1738, 1739, 1757, 1479, 1596, 1696, 1759,
1598, 1599, 1601, 1701, 1820, 1821, 1822, 1823, 1714, 1824, 1785 and
1435 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) When the Rules refer to a class of entities as a
          "commodity", this means that that class of entities has
          certain properties as described herein.

      (b) Instances of a commodity may be created, destroyed,
          appropriated, abandoned, or transferred only in such manner
          and in such circumstances as the Rules permit. When
          permitted, creation, destruction, appropriation,
          abandonment, or transfer shall be effected by Public Forum
          announcement, or by whatever other method the Rules
          establish in the circumstance.

      (c) Instances of a transferrable commodity may be transferred by
          their possessor to any other entity capable of possessing
          commodities, except when the Rules specifically prohibit
          such transfer. Nontransferrable commodities may be
          transferred only when the Rules specifically so allow.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Indulgences are a transferrable commodity.
        (1) The possessor of an Indulgence may use that Indulgence to
            cancel any one Blot in eir possession, by Public Forum
            Announcement. Doing so destroys both the Blot and the
            Indulgence.
        (2) The Herald shall maintain the records of Indulgence
            ownership.

      (b) Blots are a nontransferrable commodity.
        (1) The possessor of a Blot may destroy that Blot by
            cancelling it with an Indulgence in accordance with
            subdivision (a)(1) of this Rule.
        (2) When the Rules state that a Player is to gain some number
            of Blots, the Herald shall create that number of Blots and
            transfer them to that Player's possession.
        (3) The Herald shall maintain the records of Blot ownership.
        (4) A Player who possesses no Blots may be said to be
            Immaculate.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) A Lawless Player is a Player who possesses more than 30
          Blots.

      (b) Whenever a Player correctly alleges in the Public Forum that
          another Player is Lawless, the Lawless Player is removed
          from any Offices e holds, is deregistered, and is barred
          from reregistering for a period of one month..

      (d) If the Lawless Player was the Speaker, the Speaker-Elect
          first immediately becomes Speaker, and the old Speaker
          ceases to be Speaker.

      (f) To incorrectly allege in the Public Forum that a Player is
          Lawless is the Crime of Persecution, a Class A Crime.

      (h) This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would
          prohibit a Lawless Player from being deregistered.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1670 be amended to read:

      There is a Patent Title of Distributor. It shall be possessed by
      that person most responsible for the maintenance of the Public
      Forum, as designated by the Registrar. It shall be awarded
      without need for a proposal when the Registrar identifies this
      person in the Public Forum. The title shall be removed whenever
      the Registrar designates a new Distributor.

      If the Distributor is a Player, the Registrar shall, as soon as
      possible after the beginning of each month, pay out to the
      Distributor Voting Tokens equivalent to the Basic Officer
      Salary, in recognition of eir service.

      The Registrar is obliged to keep the Distributor informed of the
      e-mail addresses of all Players, as well as to inform the
      Distributor of any address change as soon as possible after e
      learns of it.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1771 be amended to read:

      An Player may increase or decrease the Priority of a Proposal in
      the Queue by announcing to the Public Forum that e does so, and
      paying a number of P-Notes to the Bank. For each P-Note e pays
      to the Bank, the Priority of the Proposal is increased or
      decreased by one as specified by the Player making the payment,
      provided that this transfer is not executed for any other
      purpose.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1439 be amended to read:

      If a Call For Judgement (CFJ) clearly alleging that a Player has
      violated a specific Rule is found to be TRUE, the Player
      receives Blots equal to the Power of the violated Rule rounded
      down to the nearest whole integer, or four Blots if its Power
      exceeds four. This Rule defers to the wording of the violated
      Rule when it defines a Blot penalty in the specific case of a
      CFJ, or specifically forbids Blot penalties in the case of a
      CFJ.

      The Player who initially called for the CFJ shall make the
      Payment Orders necessary to apply the Blots.

      If such a Judgement is overturned upon appeal, then the Player
      who received Blots shall vacate the Blots that were given due to
      the initial Judgement of the CFJ.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1377 be amended to read:

      There is an Office of Herald.

      The Herald's Report includes the following:

      (a) The Honour of every Entity that has been a Player at any
          time within the last three months, and the changes thereof
          since the last posting of the Herald's Report.

      (b) The reason for each such change; in the case of a
          Player-initiated change this includes any justification
          provided by the Player.

      (c) The Currency Records for Indulgences.

      (d) A list of all Fugitives from Justice, and the number of
          Fugitive Blots attributed to each such Fugitive.

      The Herald shall receive a salary equal to 2 times the Basic
      Officer Salary.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1854 be amended to read:

      The Chancellor can set the level of the Basic Officer Salary by
      announcing in the Public Forum that e is doing so, provided that
      e announces a value between 0 VTs and 8 VTs inclusive, that e
      makes the announcement before the 25th day of the month, and
      that the Basic Officer Salary has not already been set by a
      similar such announcement earlier in the month.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1677 be amended to read:

      As soon as possible after the start of a Player's Grace Period,
      the Registrar shall pay out 5 Voting Tokens and 1 P-Note to that
      Player.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1678 be amended to read:

      If an Interested Proposal passes, and that Proposal was
      submitted by a Player within that Player's Grace Period, then
      the Assessor shall pay out to that Player an award of 3 Voting
      Tokens, over and above any other award that Player might also
      receive for that Proposal. This Rule takes precedence over Rules
      that would prevent this award.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 502 be amended to read:

      The Clerk of the Courts shall, within one week of the time a
      Player earns a Judicial Salary, pay out that Judicial Salary to
      that Player.

      If a decision (or dismissal) which resulted in a Player earning
      a Judicial Salary is subsequently appealed and overturned on
      appeal, the Clerk of the Courts shall vacate the Payment Order
      paying the salary originally received for that decision.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1799 be amended to read:

      Any Order may always be amended, stayed, or vacated by the
      Player (or, in the case of Appellate Orders, Board of Appeal)
      who executed it. Certain classes of Orders may be amended,
      stayed, or vacated in other circumstances as well, when the
      Rules so allow. In all cases, this is done by an Order to Amend,
      Stay, or Vacate, respectively, the original Order.

      Otherwise, an Order shall not be amended, stayed, vacated, or
      otherwise changed once executed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 408 be amended to read:

      The Player assigned to Judge a Call for Judgement is required to
      either return a Judgement upon that CFJ or dismiss that CFJ
      within the assigned deliberation period, which ends seven days
      after e is assigned to Judge it.

      Failure to do so is the Infraction of Judging Late, detected and
      reported by the CotC. At the time of the report of the
      Infraction, if the CFJ has been Judged or dismissed then the
      penalty is 1 VT and the Judgement or dismissal is legal even
      though delivered late. Otherwise the penalty is 3 Blots, and the
      Judge becomes ineligible to Judge that CFJ, and a new Judge
      shall be assigned in the usual manner.

      A Judge who has neither judged nor dismissed a CFJ within seven
      days after the end of the assigned deliberation period becomes
      ineligible to Judge that CFJ, and any Judgement or Dismissal
      submitted after this time is not legal and shall not be accepted
      by the CotC.

      However, if the Player assigned to Judge a CFJ ceases to be
      eligible before judging or dismissing that CFJ, then e is
      neither required nor permitted to either return a Judgement on,
      or dismiss, that CFJ, and ceases to be the Judge assigned to
      that CFJ at the moment e becomes ineligible.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 681 be amended to read:

      If the Speaker announces in the Public Forum that e is giving up
      the Speakership voluntarily, a Speaker Transition occurs.

      As soon as possible after the Transition is completed, the new
      Speaker shall bill the former Speaker one Voting Token.

      When a Speaker voluntarily gives up the Speakership in this
      manner, e is prevented from nominating emself for the Office of
      Speaker-Elect for a period lasting two weeks, or until the start
      of the next quarter, whichever is longest.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 947 be amended to read:

      If a Proposal is adopted which, as part or all of its effect,
      repeals one or more Rules, and immediately prior to the adoption
      of this Proposal there were more than 100 Rules, the Rulekeepor
      shall pay out 1 P-Note to the Proposer of that Proposal.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1007 be amended to read:

      At the beginning of each month, the Registrar shall pay out to
      each Player the designated Salary for each Office that Player
      has held for a total of at least 12 days in the preceding month.

      There is a Basic Officer Salary, equal to a number of Voting
      Tokens, the level of which is set by the Chancellor, as
      described in other Rules. Salaries are permitted to be expressed
      in terms of the Basic Salary. Unless otherwise specified, the
      Salary for an Office shall be equal to the Basic Salary.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1505 be amended to read:

      The following Classes of Crime are defined, with the listed
      penalties:

      Class A Crime: The Player receives 20 Blots and loses 20 VTs.

      Class B Crime: The Player receives 10 Blots and loses 10 VTs.

      Class C Crime: The Player receives 4 Blots and loses 4 VTs.

      Class D Crime: The Player receives 2 Blots and loses 2 VTs.

      Class E Crime: The Player receives 1 Blot and loses 1 VT.

      Class 1 Crime: The Player receives 1 Blot.

      Class 2 Crime: The Player receives 2 Blots.

      Class 3 Crime: The Player receives 3 Blots.

      Class 4 Crime: The Player receives 4 Blots.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1442 be amended to read:

      Proposals have a voting cost, equal to the Voting Tariff at the
      time they were distributed. If there was no value set for the
      Voting Tariff at that time, then the voting cost is 1 VT.

      As soon as possible after the end of the Voting Period of a
      given Proposal, the Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity a
      number of Voting Tokens equal to the votes cast on that Proposal
      by that entity multiplied by the voting cost for that Proposal.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1723 be amended to read:

      A Proposal is Sane if all the following conditions are met:

      (a) the text of the message wherein it is submitted explicitly
          states that it is a Sane Proposal,

      (b) The Proposal is Interested,

      (c) The Proposer has paid 2 P-Notes to the Bank, expressly for
          this purpose (and not for any other). In order for this
          payment to have effect, it must be made before the Proposal
          is distributed.

      Players may cast no more than one vote on a Sane Proposal.
      Non-Player Voting Entities may not vote on Sane Proposals.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would allow
      non-Player Voting Entities to vote on Sane Proposals, or which
      would allow Players to cast more than one vote on a Sane
      Proposal.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1724 be amended to read:

      A Proposal is Urgent if all the following conditions are met:

      (a) the text of the message wherein it is submitted explicitly
          states that it is an Urgent Proposal,

      (b) The Proposal is Interested,

      (c) The Proposer has paid 1 P-Note to the Bank, expressly for
          this purpose (and not for any other). In order for this
          payment to have effect, it must be made before the Proposal
          is distributed.

      The Voting Period of an Urgent Proposal is five days.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would specify the
      Voting Period for Urgent Proposals.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1562 be amended to read:

      The Clerk of the Courts shall dismiss without prejudice any CFJ
      made by a Player who has previously made five or more CFJs
      during that Nomic Week. Such a CFJ is called an "excess CFJ".
      The Player who submits an excess CFJ commits the Infraction of
      Excess CFJing, to be reported by the Clerk of the Courts and
      bearing a penalty of 0.5 VT.

      If the Clerk of the Courts fails to dismiss an excess CFJ, and
      instead assigns it to a Judge, then the CFJ shall not be
      dismissed for being an excess CFJ and shall be Judged (or
      dismissed) exactly as any other CFJ. Failing to dismiss an
      excess CFJ is the Infraction of Allowing Excess CFJing, to be
      reported by the Justiciar, and bearing a penalty of 0.5 VT and
      two Blots.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1742 be amended to read:

      If two (or more) Players enter into an agreement, but one (or
      more) of these Players then fails to comply with that agreement,
      any other Player party to that agreement may make a CFJ alleging
      that that agreement has been broken.

      If the Judge of such a CFJ finds that the agreement has in fact
      been broken, e is permitted to issue Orders binding upon any or
      all of the parties of the broken agreement so as to effect fair
      and appropriate restitution for its breach. When restitution
      would involve the transfer of Currencies, the Judge is
      authorized to execute whatever Payment Orders are necessary to
      effect fair and appropriate restitution.

      The above notwithstanding, no restitution shall be available
      with respect to the breach of the agreement which would have
      required a Player to break the Rules, nor shall restitution
      include the execution of Payment Orders, the payor of which is
      any entity not party to the agreement.

      Nothing in this Rule shall be construed so as to impair the
      enforcement of an agreement which requires a Player to violate
      another agreement.

      A CFJ alleging that an agreement has been broken called by
      anyone who is not party to that agreement lacks standing and
      shall be dismissed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1661 be amended to read:

      A Speaker who is not Tainted has the Right of Patronage. This
      Right is the authority to, once a week, order the award of
      specific currencies from the Bank to specific Players, only as
      specified in this Rule.

      The Speaker exercises this right by posting to the Public Forum
      a Payment Order from the Bank to one Player for not more than 1
      unit of any one Currency Minted by the Bank. The Player to
      receive the award must not have received a Patronage award
      within the preceding four weeks, and the Speaker must provide a
      reason along with the Payment Order.

      Such awards are only permitted to recognize acts the Speaker
      believes to be of benefit to the Agora community, acts that the
      Speaker believes to exceed the call of duty, or acts that the
      Speaker believes to be of extreme sacrifice for the good of the
      Game.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1662 be amended to read:

      After the end of every month, if the same Player was Speaker for
      that entire month, the Registrar shall pay out a Speaker's
      Gratuity of two VTs to the Speaker.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1447 be amended to read:

      Once a Board of Appeals has been selected to decide a particular
      appeal, the Justices shall, collectively, consider the question.

      Each Justice has seven days, from the point e becomes Justice on
      a particular Board, in which to reach a determination that
      either sustains or overturns the matter being considered by that
      Board and submit it to the CotC.

      Failure to do so is the Infraction of Failing to Judge an
      Appeal, detected and reported by the CotC, bearing a penalty of
      3 Blots, which results in that Justice's dismissal as a Justice
      from that Board. In this case the CotC must randomly select an
      eligible Player to replace em.

      After all three Justices have submitted their determinations to
      the CotC, the CotC shall post these determinations in the Public
      Forum along with any arguments, evidence, or other material
      included with those determinations.

      If a majority of the Justices agree to sustain the matter being
      considered, it is sustained; otherwise, it is overturned. The
      specific results of overturning a matter upon appeal are
      determined by the Rules permitting such appeals.

      Each Justice who submits eir determination to the CotC before
      the end of the assigned deliberation period shall receive a
      Judicial Salary of 1 VT upon the publication of eir
      determination.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1465 be amended to read:

      At the start of the first Nomic Week after the legal and correct
      announcement that a Player has won a Game, that Player shall
      receive a Champion's Reward. The Champion's Reward shall last
      for four Nomic weeks from that time, and is then withdrawn from
      that Player. As soon as possible after the legal and correct
      announcement that a Player has won a Game, the Registrar shall
      pay out four Voting Tokens to that Player.

      Any Player who has been awarded a Champion's Reward that has not
      yet been withdrawn, has the right to cast three votes on any
      Proposal.

      The Registrar shall maintain a list of all Champion's Rewards
      which have been granted and have not yet been withdrawn,
      including to whom they have been granted, and their times of
      commencement and conclusion. This list is known as the Green
      Pages, and is part of the Registrar's Report.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1862 be amended to read:

      The Voting Tariff is a number of VTs, a multiple of the MUQ,
      between 0 and 2 inclusive. Unless the Rules give it another
      value, the Voting Tariff is 1 VT.

      The Assessor may change the value of the Voting Tariff by
      announcing the new value in the Public Forum, provided that e
      announces a value within the range proscribed above, that e
      makes the announcement prior to midnight GMT Thursday, and that
      e has not already made such an announcement earlier in the Week.
      The new value of the Voting Tariff does not take effect until
      the beginning of the Nomic Week after the change has been
      announced.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1565 be amended to read:

      A Judge must dismiss a CFJ if one of the following is true of
      it:

      (a) It contains no clearly-identifiable Statement.

      (b) Its Statement can not logically admit to either being TRUE
          or FALSE.

      (c) Its Statement does not relate to a matter relevant to the
          Rules.

      (d) Its Statement fails to comply with the Rules.

      (e) It lacks standing, as defined elsewhere.

      (f) After a reasonable effort by the Judge to obtain all
          relevant information, no determination can be made of the
          truth or falsity of its Statement.

      The Judge does this by notifying the CotC of the CFJ's
      dismissal, and the reasons e is doing so. Dismissals are only
      legal when made for the reasons listed in this Rule. Dismissal
      occurs when the CotC is notified of a legal dismissal.

      As soon as possible after being notified of a legal dismissal,
      the CotC must post to the Public Forum a notice of the dismissal
      and the Judge's reasons for doing so.

      If the dismissal, upon appeal, is subsequently set aside, then
      that CFJ is no longer dismissed. It shall be considered again
      and can not again be legally dismissed for the same reasons.

      A Judge who dismisses a CFJ before the end of the assigned
      deliberation period shall receive a Judicial Salary of 1 VT.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1664 be amended to read:

      Any Player is either Abiding or Rebellious. A new Player is
      always Abiding when e becomes a player. A Player can switch from
      Abiding to Rebellious or from Rebellious to Abiding by sending a
      message to the Public Forum saying e does change so. The
      Registrar shall maintain a list of all Players that are
      Rebellious. This list is known as the Red Pages, and is part of
      the Registrar's Report.

      A Player may Call for a Revolt at any time, by sending to the
      Public Forum saying e does so. A Call for Revolt is only
      effective if the following conditions are met:

      (a) The player posting the Call is Rebellious,

      (b) No other effective Call for Revolt has been made that week,

      (c) A successful Revolt has not occured for a month or more.

      As soon as possible after an effective Call for Revolt has been
      posted, the Registrar must determine whether the Revolt
      succeeds, as outlined below, and post the result to the Public
      Forum.

      The result of a Revolt is determined as follows: The Registrar
      selects a random integer from 1 to the number of Players at the
      time of the Call for Revolt. If this number is less than or
      equal to the number of Rebellious Players at the time of the
      Call for Revolt, then the Revolt succeeds, otherwise it fails.

      If a Revolt succeeds, then the following events occur (in
      order):

      (a) The Registrar shall vacate all Blots of each Rebellious
          Player.

      (b) The Registrar shall pay out 2 VTs to each Rebellious Player.

      (c) The Registrar is empowered and required to levy a tax of 75%
          on indulgences. The holder of the Patent Title "Robespierre"
          is exempt from this tax, even if other rules don't allow tax
          exemptions.

      (d) A Speaker Transition occurs

      (e) All Players that hold one or more Offices in the normal
          fashion cease to hold those in a normal fashion and hold
          them temporarily instead.

      (f) All Rebellious Players become Abiding again

      If a Revolt does not succeed, then:

      (a) All Rebellious Players gain 2 Blots.

      (b) The Player who Called for Revolt gains 2 (additional) Blots

      The Registrar shall execute all Payment Orders required by this
      rule.

      The Registrar is authorised to vacate any payment orders this
      rule requires em to vacate.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1449 be amended to read:

      There shall exist the Office of Assessor. The Assessor shall
      receive a salary equal to 0.5 times the Basic Officer Salary.

      The Assessor shall also receive a Commission. At the end of the
      Voting Period for a Proposal, the Assessor shall pay out to
      emself an amount equal to 5% of the VTs spent on voting on that
      Proposal.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1567 be amended to read:

      A Player makes emself ineligible to be the Judge of a specific
      CFJ by transmitting a notice to the Clerk of the Courts,
      specifying the CFJ for which e wishes to be made ineligible.

      If, at the time a Player makes emself ineligible to be a Judge
      of a CFJ in this manner, e has already been selected as the
      Judge of that CFJ, the Clerk of the Courts shall bill that
      Player a fee of 0.5 VT and shall recuse that Player as the Judge
      of that CFJ.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1747 be amended to read:

      The Clerk of the Courts has the power to Pardon Lawless Players.
      The Clerk may not exercise this power more than once per Nomic
      month, and may not Pardon the same Player twice in a given term
      of office (although, if re-elected later, e may again Pardon
      that Player). The Clerk of the Courts Pardons a Player by
      announcing e is doing so in the Public Forum. Then the following
      events shall occur:

      (a) The Clerk of the Courts shall request the Herald to
          eliminate all Fugitive Blots owned by the Pardoned Player,
          and the Herald shall do so as soon as possible.

      (b) The Clerk of the Courts may, if necessary, vacate any
          Payment Orders for Indulgences possessed by the Pardoned
          Player's estate in order to reduce the number of Blots
          possessed by the Player's estate to below the threshhold for
          Lawlessness. The CotC may not Vacate Payment Orders for X
          number of Indulgences if Vacating PO's for a lesser number
          of Indulgences would suffice to render the Player no longer
          Lawless.

      (c) After the above two actions have been completed, the Player
          may reregister.

      (d) The Pardoned Player shall then post a Formal Apology to the
          Public Forum for eir Lawlessness. The CotC may include a
          list of up to ten Prescribed Words in eir Pardon.

      (e) A Pardoned Player is not subject to Persistent Indebtedness
          penalties for three months after being Pardoned, but during
          this period e must apply all Indulgences received (from any
          source) to eir debt and may not transfer them to another
          Entity.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule governing Lawlessness,
      Fugitive Blots, when a deregistered Player may reregister, or
      Persistent Indebtedness.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1568 be amended to read:

      Any Player who goes on Hold while selected as the Judge of one
      or more CFJs commits the Infraction of Judge Inactivity. This
      Infraction is to be reported by the Clerk of the Courts, and has
      a penalty of 0.5 VT times the number of CFJs for which the
      Player was selected as Judge when e went On Hold.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1786 be amended to read:

      A Proposal is considered to have passed by the narrowest of
      margins when all of the following conditions are true:

      (a) The Proposal has met the requirements established by other
          Rules to be considered passed.

      (b) If there had been 1 (one) less FOR vote (out of the total
          number of FOR votes in the final tally) on this proposal, it
          would not have passed or not met Quorum-- or both.

      (c) There must have been at least 1 (one) AGAINST vote in the
          final tally.

      As soon as possible after a Proposal has been determined to have
      passed by the narrowest of margins, the Assessor shall pay out
      to that Proposal's Proposer an award of 3 (three) Voting Tokens
      in addition to any other award that Player might also receive
      for the passing of that Proposal.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 833 be amended to read:

      As soon as possible after the beginning of the Nomic Week, the
      Assessor shall pay out two Proposal Notes to each Player who
      submitted an Interested Proposal which was adopted during the
      previous Week.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 591 be amended to read:

      A Judge judges a CFJ by sending eir Judgment to the Clerk of the
      Courts. The Judgement of a CFJ must be either TRUE or FALSE.
      Only the Judge assigned to a CFJ may Judge that CFJ.

      As soon as possible after the receipt of a legal Judgement, the
      Clerk shall distribute the Judgement to the Public Forum.

      A Judge who delivers Judgement on a CFJ before the end of the
      assigned deliberation period shall receive a Judicial Salary of
      1 VT.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1727 be amended, by deleting the
paragraph which begins, "BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that, not less than
seven days prior" and by deleting the paragraph which begins, "BE IT
FURTHER RESOLVED that the Chancellor shall," and by deleting the
paragraph which begins, "BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Notary may".

Protoproposal Chaos239 [rev. 1]

Motions, revisited

Be it resolved, that Rules 789, 1500, 1564, 1826, 1827, 1828 and 1868
be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rules 502, 911, 1365, 1439, 1447, 1457,
1552, 1565, 1570, 1693, 1694, 1695, 1727, 1769, 1794, 1796, 1799,
1804, 1805, 1806, 1807, 1809, 1833 and 1879 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 1, to read:

      (a) The Court of Appeals shall consist of three Justices. These
          shall be the Justiciar, the Clerk of the Courts, and the
          Speaker. In addition, temporary Justices may be selected by
          the Clerk of the Courts.

      (b) Each appeal shall be considered by a panel of three
          Justices.

      (c) Each panel shall initially consist of the three permanent
          Justices.

      (d) A Justice is removed from a panel whenever:
        (1) e steps down;
        (2) e goes On Hold; or
        (3) e ceases to be a Player.

      (e) A Justice must step down from a panel if that Justice:
        (1) was the Judge of the CFJ from which the appeal arises; or
        (2) was ineligible to be selected to serve as the Judge of the
            CFJ from which the appeal arises.
        (3) Further, a Justice may step down from a panel whenever e
            believes it proper to do so. A Justice steps down from a
            specified appeal by notifying the Clerk of the Courts.
        (4) A panel which, for any reasons, consists of fewer than
            three unique Justices shall have a sufficient number of
            temporary Justices added to it so as to give it three
            unique Justices. Temporary Justices shall be selected at
            random by the Clerk of the Courts from amongst all Active
            Players.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 1, to read:

      (a) The Court of Appeals shall have exclusive jurisdiction to
          decide any question regarding:
        (1) the correctness or legality of the Judgement entered by a
            Judge in a Call for Judgement;
        (2) the correctness, appropriateness, or legality of any
            Judicial Order;
        (3) the correctness, appropriateness, or legality of the grant
            or denial of any Judicial Motion; or
        (4) any allegation that a Judge has failed to properly perform
            eir duties as a Judge.

      (b) An appeal shall be initiated to decide any question of the
          sort listed in subdivision (a) of this Rule when requested
          in the Public Forum by: any one Player, if the question
          involves the issuance of an Order which binds that Player;

      (c) any one Player, if the question involves a Judgement which
          convicts that Player of a Crime; or

      (d) any three Players.

      When an appeal is initiated, the Court shall immediately convene
      and collectively decide the question, either in the affirmative
      or the negative, and upon reaching a decision the Court shall
      inform the Clerk of the Courts of its decision and the reasons
      therefore (if any).

      The Court of Appeals shall have the power to execute such
      Judicial Orders as may be necessary to enforce its
      determination, subject to the limitations established in the
      Rules upon Judicial Orders issued by the Court of Appeals.

      The Clerk of the Courts is directed to establish a system of
      nomenclature for certified questions so as to permit easy and
      unambiguous reference to them.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 1, to read:

      (a) A Motion is a formal request made by a Player to a Court.
          This may be either a Common Court or the Court of Appeals.

      (b) A Motion is filed by submitting it to the Clerk of the
          Courts, clearly identifying the CFJ or certified question to
          which the Motion applies, and setting forth the action
          requested.

      (c) The Clerk of the Courts shall forward each properly-filed
          Motion to the Court in question as soon as possible after
          receiving it.

      (d) Within five days (unless the Court defers ruling on the
          motion) the Court shall rule on the Motion, either granting
          or denying it. If a Court fails to rule or defer ruling on a
          Motion within the time alloted by this subdivision, it is
          assumed to have denied it.

      (e) A Court may defer ruling on a Motion by informing the Clerk
          of the Courts that it is doing so, in which case it must
          either grant or deny the Motion not later than it issues a
          decision on the CFJ or certified question with which the
          Motion is associated. A Court may not defer ruling on a
          Motion made after decision has been granted. If the Court
          fails to rule on a deferred Motion by the time it issues a
          decision on the related CFJ or certified question, it is
          assumed to have denied it.

      (f) The effect of granting a Motion depends on the nature of the
          Motion granted, but generally amounts to requiring the Court
          to perform as requested by the Motion. A Motion requesting a
          Judicial Order, if granted, requires that Court to execute
          the Order requested.

      (g) A Court rules on a motion by filing its ruling of grant or
          denial with the Clerk of the Courts, along with any reasons
          it chooses to state.

      (h) Upon receipt of a Court's ruling on a Motion, the Clerk
          shall note the ruling made and the reasons, if any, on the
          record of the CFJ or certified question, and shall notify
          the Player who made the Motion of the ruling.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 1, to read:

      (a) Whenever a Call for Judgement is received by the Clerk of
          the Courts, the Clerk shall convene a new Common Court to
          hear that CFJ, and shall assign a Player to act as the Judge
          of that Court.

      (b) If the Player assigned as the Judge of a Court ceases to be
          eligible to act as the Judge in that Court, and any CFJ
          assigned to that Court is not fully resolved, the Clerk of
          the Courts shall assign a new Player to act as the Judge of
          that Court.

      (c) Once a CFJ is assigned to a Common Court, it shall remain
          assigned to that Court, unless transferred to another Court
          by an Order of Transfer.

      (d) The selection of Players to act as the Judge of a Common
          Court shall be made from amongst all those Players eligible
          to serve as the Judge of that Court.

      (e) Once assigned as the Judge of a Court, that Player remains
          the Judge of that Court until e is recused as Judge of that
          Court, or e ceases to be a Player.

      (f) A CFJ is fully resolved if:
        (1) it has been either judged or dismissed and such judgement
            or dismissal has not been vacated; and
        (2) every filed Motion which applies to that CFJ has been
            either granted or denied.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 1, to read:

      (a) The Clerk of the Courts shall, within one week of the time a
          Player earns a Judicial Salary, pay out that Judicial Salary
          to that Player.

      (b) If a decision (or dismissal) which resulted in a Player
          earning a Judicial Salary is subsequently appealed and
          overturned on appeal, the Clerk of the Courts shall vacate
          the Payment Order paying the salary originally received for
          that decision.

      (c) There shall exist a type of Application called an
          Application to Submit an Opinion. Such an Application, if
          effective, has the effect of annotating a Judgement or
          Dismissal in a given Call for Judgement. In order for such
          an Application to have effect upon Execution, it must
          satisfy the following requirements:

      (d) * It must clearly indicate to which CFJ it applies.
          * It must be labeled as either a Concurring Opinion or
            a Dissenting Opinion.
          * It must indicate whether the Judgement or Dismissal to
            which it applies is that of the Judge or that of the
            Appeals Court.
          * It must be accompanied by reasons and arguments, which
            may include, but are not necessarily limited to, citations
            of deciding Rules, past Judgements, and Game Custom.
          * It must bear the Signatures of at least two Players.
          * It must be Executed no earlier than the submission of the
            Judgement or Dismissal to which it applies, and no later
            than one week after the publication by the Clerk of the
            Courts of that Judgement or Dismissal.

      (e) An Application to Submit an Opinion is Executed by
          submitting it to the Clerk of the Courts. Such an
          Application, having been Executed and having met all the
          requirements for effectiveness, is also called an Opinion.
          It is also referred to as a Concurring Opinion or a
          Dissenting Opinion, as indicated in the Opinion.

      (f) Once an Application to Submit an Opinion is Executed and
          takes effect, the Clerk of the Courts must distribute the
          Opinion to all Players as soon as possible. Furthermore, the
          Opinion must be appended to the Legal Judgement or
          Dismissal.

      (g) If a Call For Judgement (CFJ) clearly alleging that a Player
          has violated a specific Rule is found to be TRUE, the Player
          receives Blots equal to the Power of the violated Rule
          rounded down to the nearest whole integer, or four Blots if
          its
          Power exceeds four. This Rule defers to the wording of the
          violated Rule when it defines a Blot penalty in the specific
          case of a CFJ, or specifically forbids Blot penalties in the
          case of a CFJ.

      (h) The Player who initially called for the CFJ shall make the
          Payment Orders necessary to apply the Blots.

      (i) If such a Judgement is overturned upon appeal, then the
          Player who received Blots shall vacate the Blots that were
          given due to the initial Judgement of the CFJ.

      (j) Once a Board of Appeals has been selected to decide a
          particular appeal, the Justices shall, collectively,
          consider the question.

      (k) Each Justice has seven days, from the point e becomes
          Justice on a particular Board, in which to reach a
          determination that either sustains or overturns the matter
          being considered by that Board and submit it to the CotC.

      (l) Failure to do so is the Infraction of Failing to Judge an
          Appeal, detected and reported by the CotC, bearing a penalty
          of 3 Blots, which results in that Justice's dismissal as a
          Justice from that Board. In this case the CotC must randomly
          select an eligible Player to replace em.

      (m) After all three Justices have submitted their determinations
          to the CotC, the CotC shall post these determinations in the
          Public Forum along with any arguments, evidence, or other
          material included with those determinations.

      (n) If a majority of the Justices agree to sustain the matter
          being considered, it is sustained; otherwise, it is
          overturned. The specific results of overturning a matter
          upon appeal are determined by the Rules permitting such
          appeals.

      (o) Each Justice who submits eir determination to the CotC
          before the end of the assigned deliberation period shall
          receive a Judicial Salary of 1 VT upon the publication of
          eir determination.

      (p) When any Player believes that a Subordinate Legal Code (SLC)
          has been violated by a Player within the SLC's Jurisdiction
          e shall inform the Maintainer of that SLC of that belief,
          along with the nature of the violation, the violated text of
          the SLC, and the identity of the violating Player. The
          Maintainer shall then, as soon as possible, distribute this
          information to all Players within the Jurisdiction of the
          violated SLC.

      (q) If, within 72 hours of this distribution, no Player within
          the SLC's Jurisdiction disputes the claim, the Maintainer
          shall declare the SLC violated. The Maintainer is then
          allowed to initiate any corrections and penalties allowed by
          the Rules and the violated SLC.

      (r) If any Player under the SLC's Jurisdiction disputes the
          claim of violation within 72 hours, then any Player may
          submit a Call for Judgement, alleging that a specific Player
          has violated the SLC. Such a CFJ cannot be made in any other
          circumstance.

      (s) All Players within the SLC's Jurisdiction are automatically
          ineligible to Judge such a CFJ.

      (t) Whenever such a CFJ is found TRUE, the SLC has been violated
          and the SLC's Maintainer shall perform the same duties as
          when no Player contests the claim. If such a TRUE Judgement
          is overturned on Appeal, those actions shall be reversed to
          the extent possible immediately upon the resolution of the
          appeal.

      (u) In order for an Official Document to be valid for the
          purpose of a Ratification, it must satisfy all the following
          criteria at the time the Proposal which would Ratify it is
          Proposed:

           (v) i) The Rules require some specific Player to produce
               and/or
                  maintain the document.
              ii) The Rules required it to be published in the Public
                  Forum. (A requirement that it be sent to all Players
                  fulfills this criterion.)
             iii) It is not currently subject to a Claim of Error.
             (COE)
              iv) It is not currently subject to a pending Call for
                  Judgement (CFJ), or a pending Appeal of a CFJ.
               v) The information within the Document has not been
                  superseded by a subsequent Document.
              vi) The Document is not the Ruleset. The Ruleset is
                  specifically excluded from Ratification.

      (w) Further, a Document can become invalid during the Voting
          Period of a Proposal which would Ratify it if any of the
          following occurs:

           (x) i) The Document is superseded by a subsequent Document
                  which contradicts the information in the prior
                  Document. This does not apply if there is a COE
                  alleging the contradiction is an error, and the
                  error is admitted before the end of the Proposal's
                  Voting Period.
              ii) A COE is made on the Document, and the COE has not
              been
                  denied before the end of the Proposal's Voting
                  Period.
             iii) The Document becomes subject to a pending CFJ or a
                  pending appeal of a CFJ.

       (y) If, during the Voting Period of a Proposal to Ratify a
           Document, another Document is issued that does not
           contradict the prior Document, it does not alter the
           validity of the prior Document.

       (z) A Judge must dismiss a CFJ if one of the following is true
           of it:

        (aa) i) It contains no clearly-identifiable Statement.
            ii) Its Statement can not logically admit to either being
            TRUE
                or FALSE.
           iii) Its Statement does not relate to a matter relevant to
           the
                Rules.
            iv) Its Statement fails to comply with the Rules.
             v) It lacks standing, as defined elsewhere.
            vi) After a reasonable effort by the Judge to obtain all
                relevant information, no determination can be made of
                the truth or falsity of its Statement.

      (bb) The Judge does this by notifying the CotC of the CFJ's
           dismissal, and the reasons e is doing so. Dismissals are
           only legal when made for the reasons listed in this Rule.
           Dismissal occurs when the CotC is notified of a legal
           dismissal.

      (cc) As soon as possible after being notified of a legal
           dismissal, the CotC must post to the Public Forum a notice
           of the dismissal and the Judge's reasons for doing so.

      (dd) If the dismissal, upon appeal, is subsequently set aside,
           then that CFJ is no longer dismissed. It shall be
           considered again and can not again be legally dismissed for
           the same reasons.

      (ee) A Judge who dismisses a CFJ before the end of the assigned
           deliberation period shall receive a Judicial Salary of 1
           VT.

      (ff) The Clerk of the Courts shall make an announcement in the
           Public Forum as soon as possible after an Appeal has been
           initiated, including in eir announcement the matter of
           consideration of the Appeal and the identity of the
           Justices selected to serve on the Board of Appeals and
           which (if any) of these Players are ineligible to fill the
           positions to which they have been assigned.

      (gg) The Clerk shall also make an announcement to the Public
           Forum as soon as possible after any change in the identity
           of the Justices that takes place after the Board has been
           constituted.

      (hh) If the Judgement of a CFJ is Appealed, the Board of Appeals
           shall consider the correctness of that Judgement. The Board
           may rule that the original Judgement was either correct or
           incorrect.

      (ii) If a majority of the Justices find that the original
           Judgement was correct, then the Board's ruling is that the
           original Judgement was correct. In that case, the original
           Judge of the CFJ shall retain eir Judicial Salary and the
           original Judgement has legal effect.

      (jj) If a majority of the Justices find that the original
           Judgement was incorrect, then the Board's ruling is that
           the original Judgement was incorrect. In that case, the
           original Judge
           of the CFJ shall forfeit eir Judicial Salary. The Board may
           then act in one of three ways, provided that a majority of
           the Justices agree:

        (kk) i) Reversal of the Judgement. In this case, the CFJ shall
                be treated as if it were Judged normally, with the
                Judgement being that which a majority of the Justices
                agree on.
            ii) Dismissal of the CFJ. The CFJ shall be considered
                dismissed.
           iii) Re-assignment of the CFJ. In this case, the original
                Judgement shall be ignored, and the CotC shall
                reassign the CFJ to a new Judge in the same fashion as
                it was originally assigned; the original Judge will be
                considered Ineligible. The new Judge cannot make the
                same Judgement as the original Judge for the same
                reason.

      (ll) If a majority of the Justices find that the original
           Judgement was incorrect, but no majority of the Justices
           agree on what action to take, then the CFJ shall be
           re-assigned as above.

      (mm) If the dismissal of a CFJ is Appealed, the Board shall not
           consider the truth or falsity of the original CFJ; they
           shall only consider whether the dismissal was properly
           made. An illegal dismissal shall not be considered
           "properly made."

      (nn) If the Board finds the dismissal to have been properly
           made, the original Judge of the CFJ shall retain eir
           Judicial Salary, and the CFJ shall remain dismissed.

      (oo) If the Board finds the dismissal to have been made
           improperly, the original Judge of the CFJ shall have eir
           Judicial Salary revoked. The CotC shall reassign the CFJ
           to a new Judge in the same fashion as originally
           assigned; the new Judge cannot dismiss it for the same
           reasons as given by the original Judge.

      (pp) In the appeal of a Judicial Order, the Board shall consider
           whether the Order in question was both legally made and
           appropriate for the situation.

      (qq) If the Board finds that the Order was made legally, and was
           appropriate for the situation, it shall affirm the Order.
           If an Order staying the execution of the appealed Order was
           entered, it shall vacate this stay.

      (rr) If the Board finds that the Order was made illegally, or
           that it was inappropriate for the situation, it shall
           vacate the original Order. Should the Board further find
           that the Order was made without reasonable justification or
           for a clearly improper purpose, it shall (at its
           discretion) impose a penalty of 2 Blots upon the Judge who
           made the original Order.

      (ss) WHEREAS, in June 1993, the world's only MUD-based nomic,
           Nomic World, had recently collapsed; yet, many of its
           players enjoyed nomic and did not wish to forego such a
           noble pursuit;

      (tt) And WHEREAS, Originator Chuck Carroll therefore composed an
           Initial Ruleset for an email nomic, based on the Initial
           Rulesets of Peter Suber, inventor of Nomic, and on the
           Rulesets of Nomic World and other nomics,

      (uu) And WHEREAS, a nomic thus rose like a phoenix from the
           ashes of Nomic World, played on the mailing list originally
           set up for discussion of Nomic World, and coming into
           existence at June 30, 1993, 00:04:30 GMT +1200, with a
           message sent by First Speaker Michael Norrish, which read,
           in part,

       (vv) "I see no reason to let this get bogged down; there are no
             precedents or rules that cover this situation, so I think
             we may as well begin directly.... Proposals for new rules
             are invited. In accordance with the rules, these will be
             published, numbered and distributed by me at my earliest
             convenience."

      (ww) And WHEREAS, this nomic began as a humble and nameless
           nomic, known unofficially as yoyo, after the mailing list
           it was played on, until its Players, much later, gave it
           its official name of Agora,

      (xx) And WHEREAS, Agora has now become the wisest, noblest,
           eldest, and most interesting of all active email nomics,
           due to the hard work and diligence of Agorans as well as
           the frequent advice of Agoraphobes,

      (yy) And WHEREAS, Agorans desire to joyously commemorate Agora's
           founding,

      (zz) BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED that Agora's Birthday is defined
           to be the entire day of June 30, GMT +1200, of each year;

     (aaa) BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that prior to, but not more than
           seven days before, Agora's Birthday, the Ambassador shall
           announce Agora's upcoming Birthday to all Friendly nomics;

     (bbb) BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that, not less than seven days prior
           to Agora's Birthday, the Chancellor shall, on behalf of the
           Bank, submit delayed Transfer Orders to be executed at
           00:04:30 GMT +1200 on Agora's Birthday to each Player for
           the amount of 3 VTs each;

     (ccc) BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Chancellor shall, on behalf
           of the Bank, submit Transfer Orders for one P-note each
           from the Bank to each Player who posts to the Public Forum
           during Agora's Birthday a message recognizing Agora's
           Birthday; these Transfer Orders to be executed as soon as
           possible after Agora's Birthday ends;

     (ddd) BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Notary may select up to
           three Contests, in existence on Agora's Birthday, which
           have as their purpose encouraging the celebration of
           Agora's Birthday; and which Contests, in the Notary's
           estimation, are worthy of recognition for this effort; and
           shall pay out to each such Contest 5 VTs, and to their
           Contestmasters 2 P-Notes each;

     (eee) BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Courts shall be closed on
           Agora's Birthday; that is, the Clerk of the Courts shall
           not publish any Calls For Judgement, Judgements, notices of
           Appeals, Decisions of Appeals Boards, or Opinions, on
           Agora's Birthday; nor shall any Player submit to the Clerk
           of the Courts a Call For Judgement, notice of ineligibility
           to Judge, Judgement, call for Appeal, or Appellate
           Decision, on Agora's Birthday; nor shall any Player Execute
           an Application to Submit an Opinion on Agora's Birthday;
           however, if any of the above do take place on Agora's
           Birthday, in violation of this Rule, this Rule does not
           deprive them of their usual effects.

     (fff) There are four classes of Order: Administrative, Judicial,
           Appellate, and Private.

     (ggg) A Judicial Order is an Order executed by a Player while
           acting as a Judge.

     (hhh) An Appellate Order is an Order executed by a Board of
           Appeals.

     (iii) An Administrative Order is an Order executed by the holder
           of an Office or other official position (such as the
           Speaker or the Recordkeepor of a Currency) other than that
           of a Judge or Justice, in the course of performing the
           duties of that Office or position.

     (jjj) A Private Order is any other sort of Order.

     (kkk) All Orders executed in the manner prescribed by the Rules
           for their class and type are presumed valid and enforceable
           until proven otherwise by CFJ.

     (lll) In order to be proven valid by CFJ, the Rules must permit
           the Player who executed the Order in question to execute
           such an Order, that the execution of the Order must have
           been required by or permitted in the circumstances which
           existed at the time it was executed, and that the Order has
           not been rendered invalid by the operation of any other
           Rule.

     (mmm) Furthermore, no Order may act to prevent or hinder its own
           appeal in any way, and any portion of an Order which has
           this effect is void and without force.

     (nnn) Any Order, except a Transfer Order, may always be amended,
           stayed, or vacated by the Player (or, in the case of
           Appellate Orders, Board of Appeal) who executed it. A
           Delayed Transfer Order may be amended, stayed or vacated by
           the Player who executed it only during the time in which it
           is delayed. Certain classes of Orders may be amended,
           stayed, or vacated in other circumstances as well, when the
           Rules so allow. In all cases, this is done by an Order to
           Amend, Stay, or Vacate, respectively, the original Order.

     (ooo) Otherwise, an Order shall not be amended, stayed, vacated,
           or otherwise changed once executed.

     (ppp) Judicial Orders are subject to appeal to a Board of Appeal
           by a Call for Appeal.

     (qqq) The Board of Appeal shall, upon finding that a Judicial
           Order is improperly or invalidly executed, order that that
           Order be amended or vacated, as it deems appropriate.

     (rrr) When the Clerk of the Courts receives a properly executed
           Call for Appeal of a Judicial Order, the Clerk of the
           Courts shall stay the Order under appeal. If the Board of
           Appeals affirms the validity of the original Order, it
           shall then vacate this stay.

     (sss) Appellate Orders are executed by being sent to the Clerk of
           the Courts by the Lead Justice of a Board of Appeals, but
           do not take effect until their publication by the Clerk of
           the Courts. The Lead Justice shall certify in eir
           submission to the Clerk of the Courts that the Order is
           executed by the concurrence of the majority of the Justices
           comprising that Board of Appeals; failure to do so deprives
           the Order of effect.

     (ttt) The Clerk of the Courts shall publish each Appellate Order
           as soon as possible after receiving it from the Board of
           Appeal which executed it.

     (uuu) Appellate Orders are not subject to appeal. However, upon a
           judicial finding that the required certification was
           falsely provided, the Justiciar shall vacate the Order
           which was accompanied by that false certification.

     (vvv) Since Appellate Orders cannot be appealed, Appellate Orders
           are valid only if addressed to:
             a) The Clerk of the Courts in eir Official capacity;
             b) an Order issued by the Clerk of the Courts in eir
             Official
                Capacity;
             c) The Judge of the CFJ which that Board of Appeals was
                convened to consider, or any Order issued by that
                Judge in that particular CFJ; or
             d) any combination of the above.

     (www) All other Appellate Orders are presumptively invalid.

     (xxx) This Rule takes precedence over all Rules pertaining to the
           validity of Appellate Orders.

     (yyy) Both Administrative and Private Orders are subject to
           appeal by a CFJ, the statement of which Statement alleges
           that the Order is improperly or invalidly executed.

     (zzz) Upon a judicial finding that an Administrative or Private
           Order was improperly or invalidly executed, the Judge so
           finding shall vacate that Order.

    (aaaa) When the Clerk of the Courts receives a properly executed
           Call for Judgement, the statement of which alleges that an
           Administrative or Private Order was improperly or invalidly
           executed, the Clerk of the Courts shall stay the Order in
           dispute. If the Judge affirms the validity of the original
           Order, e shall then vacate this stay.

    (bbbb) The Lead Justice of a Board of Appeals is the Justiciar, if
           e is serving on that Board, or the Player who serves in the
           place of the Justiciar otherwise.

    (cccc) Players receive Points when certain actions are performed
           by them or when certain events occur. This is the only Rule
           which may define the methods of Scoring. In general, a
           Player may receive points only for actions which occur
           during the current Round, although those actions may depend
           on others which occurred previously (thus, for example, a
           Player could gain points for one of eir Proposals passing,
           even if the Proposal was distributed before the beginning
           of the current Round.). Points are non-transferable.

    (dddd) In general, a Player may receive points for a certain type
           of event any number of times, unless that event has a
           number (N) after it, in which case a given Player may be
           awarded points for that type of event only N times in a
           given Round.

    (eeee) If not otherwise noted, Points awarded for events referring
           to "a Player" or "any Player", go to that Player. Bonuses
           are in addition to the basic award. Multipliers are in lieu
           of the basic award. Bonuses can be multiplied.

    (ffff) Responsibility for detecting changes to a Player's Score
           from the following events is the responsibility of the
           Scorekeepor:

    (gggg) If a Proposal proposed by a Player passes: 5 points for
           first passing Proposal by that Player in that Round, 3 for
           second, 1 for third, 0.5 for fourth and subsequent
           Proposals, +0.5 if Proposal is a Repeal, +1 if the Proposer
           does not Vote on the Proposal. Double points if Proposal
           passes unanimously. Triple Points if the Player making the
           Proposal is the only Entity who votes AGAINST.

    (hhhh) To any Player winning a contested Election: 8 points.
           Double points if Elected unanimously.

    (iiii) To any Player holding the most of a given currency at the
           end of a Round: 8 Points per currency. Tripled if at any
           point during the Round a Player had no holdings in that
           Currency.

    (jjjj) To any Player tied for the most of a given currency at the
           end of a Round: 5 Points per currency. Tripled if at any
           point during the Round a Player had no holdings in that
           Currency.

    (kkkk) To any Player holding no Currency whatsoever at the end of
           a Round: 5 Points.

    (llll) To any Player earning no Blots during a Round: 4 Points.

    (mmmm) To any Player having no Blots at the end of a Round: 6
           Points.

    (nnnn) To any Player voting on a Proposal: If the Player casts at
           least one vote which is the same as 80% or more of the
           Votes cast on a Proposal (including eir own): 1 Point,
           scored when the Proposal results are announced.

    (oooo) To any Player voting on a Proposal: If the final tally of
           Votes shows the same number of FOR votes as AGAINST votes:
           2 Points, scored when the Proposal results are announced.

    (pppp) To the Player Voting or declaring Presence on all Proposals
           of a single distribution: 0.5 Points.

    (qqqq) Changes to a Player's score from the following events may
           be reported by any Player by notifying the Scorekeepor or
           posting to the Public Forum. No Player, however, not even
           the Scorekeepor, is legally required to do so.

    (rrrr) If a Rule is created containing a Player's name in the
           text: 15 Points.

    (ssss) If a Player gains a Patent Title (other than SPTs or
           Degrees): 4 Points (1).

    (tttt) To any Player receiving a Degree: 4 Points for am A.N., 6
           points for a B.N., 8 Points for a M.N., and 12 Points for a
           D.N.Phil or a D.N.Hist.

    (uuuu) If a Proposal made by a Player successfully creates a Rule
           with a number that is a multiple of 23: 4 Points.

    (vvvv) If a Player submits a Proposal to the Queue that is
           subsequently discarded: 5 Points (1).

    (wwww) To any Player Proposing an Insane Proposal for which no
           Entity votes FOR: 30 Points.

    (xxxx) To any Player who is chided for posting a single document
           that is not an Official Report to a forum other than the
           Public Forum by more than one Player (other than
           themselves): 2 Points (1).

    (yyyy) To the third Player other than the Poster making
           substantive comments to a protoproposal: 1 Point (3).

    (zzzz) To the Player making a COE that is Responded to and
           admitted by the relevant Officer (other than themselves): 1
           Point (1).

   (aaaaa) To the Player Holding an Office for at least one month
           during the Round, and issuing at least one Official Report:
           2 Points (1)

   (bbbbb) To the Player making a Sane Proposal for which a Non-Player
           Voting Entity successfully Votes: 15 points (1).

           Players calling for that Appeal: 2 Points

   (ggggg) When an Appeal fails to overturn a Judgment, to the Judge
           who made the original Judgment on that CFJ: 4 Points.

   (hhhhh) If three consecutive CFJs are Judged TRUE, FALSE and
           UNDECIDED (in any order), to the Player making the third
           CFJ: 17 Points.

Does this need to be an integral number? What if I think a Player
has committed half a Kudo's worth of Dishonor? Shouldn't I be able to
dock him or her 0.5 or even 0.1 Kudos?

So you're objecting to protect us? How noble. Why not let us who have

Do we need a Proposal Tariff *and* a Proposal Bar?  Yes, I realize they
have slightly different effects, but I don't know that we really
need both to fine-tune things as much as we want.

While I approve in principle of the concept of allowing Officers
to influence the economy by setting critical values, our system
is starting to remind me of one of those stereo systems with
a graphic equalizer that has 30 different slide bars.  I've never seen
the need for more than about 5.

The MUQ of P-Notes is now 0.1, but I would support reducing it to 0.01.

I presume that Vlad meant the "October" here to be "December".  Why
don't you correct that while you're at it?

It's going to repeal itself in less than a month, unless someone does

Would the objectors to Summary Adoption object to a Rule that allowed
Summary Adoption with N Supporters, with N being equal to the smallest
value such that N/(# of Players - N) is at least one greater than the
AI of the Proposal being adopted? (Thus with 12 Players, N would be 8
for a Proposal with AI=1, 9 for a Proposal with AI = 2, etc.). Perhaps
that would be an acceptable compromise? Or alternative?

I will not object to the Kudo transfer (as I did earn it) but I do
object to your characterization of my intent.  As I previously
explained, this was the result of a software error; no ulterior motive 
exists.

I would support that. If we can't Adopt it Without Objection, I'd be willing
to even contribute P-Notes toward it. Instead of trying to hide motions or
creating them en masse, it would encourage people to actually announce it
openly and reasonably.

How about allowing a proposal to be declared trivial without objection.  A
trivial proposal automatically gets distributed with the next batch of
proposals and voting on it is free.  This will lower the cost of getting
such proposals passed but will not entirely bypass the normal procedure.
Would you object to this, Steve?
