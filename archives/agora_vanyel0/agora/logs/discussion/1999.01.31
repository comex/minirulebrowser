It should probably go with R1478, which is in a different, but also
inappropriate category.  I'll include a WO intent in the next Memo.

What is the advantage of making an Org a fictitious person?

It's an interesting argument--probably at least worth a CFJ.  Or you
could just try to hand out the Title, see if the Registrar recognizes
it, and take it from there.

Of course, if voting ever became free, through mishap or design,
this could be a problem. Or a small band of Players could
could make a bunch of Proposals giving them extraordinary
powers, and if enough were distributed at one time, by waiting
until just before the end of the Voting Period and massing
their votes on one, they could ensure its passage. Even if only
one gets distributed at a time, they could soak up the VTs from
the other Players who would have to ensure its failure, and
eventually one would pass by default. A single individual with
even just a few VTs could engage in Proposal extortion: "pay me
or I'll see that it fails". Hmmm, can you think of any more scams?

Why, (for the sake of the rulesets) can't a rule be in 2 categories?

Because the term approximates reasonably well the characteristics we
are seeking to give them.  There's no real "advantage" to the term; it 
merely describes the legal relation with some adequacy.  It's better
than the hackneyed and uninformative "entity", at least.

Protoproposal Chaos79 [rev. 4]

Organizational Reform

Be it therefore resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) When a Judge Orders that an action be Rescinded, that action
          is considered to have never taken place, and all legal
          consequences of that action are nullified to the extent it
          is possible to do so.

      (b) A Judge shall Order an action Rescinded only when
          specifically authorized to do so by the Rules.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1528 be amended to read:

|     (a) An Organization is a collective entity created by or
          recognized by these Rules.

|     (b) Only those collective entities which these rules have
|         created or recognized are Organizations.

      (c) Each Organization must have:
        (1) a Name, unique from that of every other Organization;
        (2) an Agent; and
        (3) a Charter.
          Any Organization which ceases to have each of the items
          listed above is subject to administrative dissolution, as
          defined elsewhere.  No Organization shall be created or
          recognized which does not have each of the items listed
          above.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) In a conflict between the Bylaws and the Charter of an
          Organization, the Charter takes precedence.

      (b) In a conflict between the Bylaws or the Charter of an
          Organization and the Rules, the Rules take precedence.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1614 be amended to read:

      (a) An Organization's name shall only be changed when its Agent
          delivers a Notice of Change of Organizational Name to the
          Notary, which must set forth the Organization's old and new
          names.  The new name must be distinct from that of every
          other existing Organization.

      (b) A Notice of Change of Organizational Name may be rescinded
          by Judicial Order; such Order shall properly issue when the
          Notice was delivered contrary to the Charter and Bylaws of
          the Organization in question.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1612 be amended to read:

      (a) An Organization's name shall only be changed when its Agent
          delivers a Notice of Change of Organizational Charter to the
          Notary.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Each Organization in existence prior to the adoption of the
          Proposal which created this Rule is deemed to be an
          Organization created under the authority of these Rules, all
          other Rules notwithstanding.  The Charter of each such
          Organization shall be its former SLC, the Agent shall be the
          Adminstrator of its former SLC, and its Membership shall be

          characteristics set forth above by events occuring after the
          adoption of the Proposal which created this Rule.

      (c) This Rule shall take precedence over every Rule with which
          it conflicts.

The Rulesets are long enough as they are!  But what doesn't work
well in email does in a hyperlinked environment--check out my
Categorized Rule Lists (http://www.dfw.net/~ccarroll/agora/rules/cats.html),
if you haven't already.  (And if you have any suggestions about what
you'd like to see there, let me know, because I'm working on
a major organizational revision of these, so now is the time to
voice your opinion!)

Granted, entity isn't that good.  But I'm not entirely comfortable
with calling them "persons" either.  Maybe there's something
better?

In my personal usage, I call them "Player-Like Entities," although
I'm not suggesting this would be a good official name either.
(There are also "Currency-Like Entities" and "Rule-Like Entities."
It seems that most of our entities fall into one of these three
categories.)

Yeah, that's the concept we're trying to set forth.  "Fictitious
Player"?  Doesn't quite have the import I want.

Protoproposal Chaos58 [rev. 3]

Proposals may Order

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1794 be amended to read:

      (a) Each Order is of one of the following classes:
        (1) Judicial: A Judicial Order is an Order executed by a
            Player while acting as a Judge.
        (2) Appellate: An Appellate Order is an Order executed by a
            Board of Appeals.
        (3) Administrative: An Administrative Order is an Order
            executed by an Officer in the course of performing the
            duties of that Office, except when those duties involve
            acting as a member of a Board of Appeals.
        (4) Legislative: A Legislative Order is an Order executed as
            part of the effect of the adoption of a Proposal.
        (5) Private: A Private Order is any Order not described above.

      (b) For the purpose of this Rule, the holder of any of the
          following positions shall be considered an Officer when
          performing a duty required by or a privilege permitted only
          by virtue of holding that position:
        (1) the Speaker;
        (2) the Recordkeepor of a Currency; or
        (3) the Trustee of an entity in Probate.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) A Proposal may contain one or more Orders.

      (b) The effect of adopting a Proposal which contains Orders is
          to execute those Orders.  Such Orders are known as
          Legislative Orders, are deemed to have been executed by that
          Proposal, and are deemed to have been executed as of the
          date of the proclamation of the Proposal's adoption.

      (c) Legislative Orders may not be stayed, vacated, or amended
          except:
        (1) by a subsequent Legislative Order;
        (2) by a Judicial Order issued only after a judicial finding
            that the Proposal containing the Legislative Order was not
            adopted, was barred from taking effect, or was invalid; or
        (3) by the Clerk of the Courts, but only for the purpose of
            staying such an Order during the pendency of a dispute
            which might reasonably lead to a judicial finding of the
            sort mentioned in subdivision (c)(2) of this Rule.

   Summary of changes to this version: 1) Instead of the kludge Scott
objected to, the Scorekeepor will now be able to amend the Scoring
Rule between Rounds Without 3 Objections. This is simpler and uses
existing mechanisms. The scoring Rule can also be amended by normal
means, of course. 2) This Proposal no longer requires the repeal of
Public Voting. I found a way to allow Voters to score even with the
Rule (this is particularly important if Steve's Division of Labor
proposal passes). In short, Voters will get points if they vote
the same way as 80% of the other voters on a Proposal. Public
Voting makes this even more strategic than other PC voting ideas
in the past. Voters will have to decide whether to vote late, and
thus take advantage of their knowledge of which way the wind is
blowing on a Proposal, or voting early in an attempt to build a
"bandwagon effect" swaying undecided voters to their side. Those
uninterested in scoring can, of course, vote as usual. To further
complicate the mix there is also a bonud for all voters if the
final result is tied. Rough estimation suggests voting and proposing
will be approximately equally lucrative.

Vlad


The following is not a Proposal. My comments are in brackets.

Protoproposal Vlad-GAT v.3:
The Grand Agoran Tournament
This Proposal consists of a number of Proposed Rule Changes, each
marked by *

* 	Create a Rule with the Following Text

The Grand Agoran Tournament

	The Grand Agoran Tournament consists of a series of Rounds.
These Rounds begin on the First of March, June, September, and October
of each year, and last for three months. At the beginning of each
Round, the Scorekeepor will draw up a list of all Active Players in
descending order of their Scores from the preceding Round. For the
first Round, this will be done instead in descending order of the
Players' combined P-Note and VT holdings taken from the most recent
Official Reports. Ties will be broken by random selection. 

	The Scorekeepor will then define a number of Circles among
which the Active Players will be partitioned. These must be as few as
possible, but there is a minimum of three Circles and an initial
maximum of six Players per Circle. They are designated the First
Circle, Second Circle, etc. ... Nth Circle. The First Circle is the
highest ranking Circle, and the Nth Circle is the lowest ranking
Circle.
	 The initial number of spots in each Circle will be the number
of Active Players divided by the number of Circles (FRD). If there are
more Players than spots the Scorekeepor will add one spot to the Nth
Circle, then one to the N-1th Circle, etc. until there are exactly as
many spots as Active Players. The First Circle spots are filled with
the highest ranked Players from the preceding Round (skipping
Inactive Players), and so on down the remainder of the Circles in
order. After the above procedure, if a Player is assigned a Circle
below that of another Player with whom e was tied at the end the last
Round, that Player shall be moved into the same Circle as the Player
with whom e was tied. The initial Score for each Player in each Round
is zero.
	When a Player joins the game e is automatically assigned to
the same Circle e held when e deregistered (if applicable and
possible), or else the lowest Circle. A Player going On Hold is
automatically withdrawn from the current Round of competition. A
Player coming Off Hold is treated as a new Player for the purposes of
this Rule, with an initial Score of zero.

[The Circle system I consider the heart of this Proposal. The
Circle system allows Players to compete against others with a similar
amount of time to devote to the game or of a similar skill level. This
should hopefully increase competitiveness among all Players, not just
those at the top.]

* Add a new Rule with the following text

Competitions

The Individual Competition
	At the end of each Round the Player with the highest Score in
eir Circle wins that Round for that Circle and receives the
corresponding Scoring Patent Title. Any Player winning eir Circle has
the option of not participating in the Round immediately following. To
exercise this option, the Player must post eir wishes to the Public
Forum within two weeks after the beginning of the Round e is opting
out of. The Player then receives no Score, and is ineligible for SPTs.
The next Round the Scorekeepor shall seed the Player based on the
score that Player received two Rounds previously.

The Team Competition
	The Team Competition runs parallel to and concurrently with
the Individual Competition. A Team consists of a group of Players who
have signed an Application to Form a Team within two weeks of the
beginning of the Round in which they wish to compete. If fewer then
two Teams register for a round, there is no Team Competition that
Round. A Team's Score is the combined Scores of its members. A Team
wins the Team Competition if at the end of that Round its Score is
greater than that of the other registered Teams.

*	Create a Rule with the following text:

Application to Form a Team

There is a type of Application called an Application to Form a Team
(AFT). A valid AFT, in order to have effect upon Execution, must
contain the following:

i)	The name of the proposed Team.
ii)	The Players who will compose the Team, which must include the
Sponsor.
iii)	The Signatures of the Players who will compose the Team.

The Sponsor of an AFT will be known as the Team Captain for the
duration of the Round.

To be valid, an AFT must also fulfill the following conditions:
i)	The proposed Team must consist of at least three Players
ii)	No two proposed Team members may belong to the same Circle.
iii)	No proposed Team Member may belong to an already existing
Team.
If any of the above three conditions ceases to be true, a Team is
immediately dissolved and removed from the current Team Competition.

A valid AFT is Executed by sending it to the Scorekeepor or submitting
it to the Public Forum.

The effect of Execution of an AFT is the entrance of the proposed Team
into the current Team Competition. A Team is automatically dissolved
at the end of the current Round, but may register again in subsequent
Rounds.

An AFT shall only be valid if its contents are not in conflict with
this or other Rules.  An AFT that is not valid shall never be
Executed.

[The Team Competition adds an interesting new dimension, combining
cooperation with competition. The requirement to have the Players come
from different Circles makes all Players desirable to have on ones
team.]

* 	Create a Rule with the following Text:

The Scorekeepor

	There is an Office of Scorekeepor, whose Salary is 1.5 times
the Basic Officer Salary, and whose responsibility it is to keep
accurate track of the current Score of all Players. The Scorekeepor's
Report consists of the Circles of the current Round and the Players in
each Circle, the current Scores of each Player, the changes in Scores
since the last Report and the way those points were earned, the Teams
entered in the current Team Competition, and the current Team Scores
of each Team.
	The Scorekeepor is also responsible for posting the final
Scores at the end of each Round, and announcing the SPTs awarded to
the Players that have fulfilled the conditions for receiving them.

Once per Round, no more than two weeks and no less than one week
before the end of the Round, the Scorekeepor may Act to Change
the Scoring Rule Without 3 Objections. The Scorekeepor may only
propose changes to the basis of Scoring, otherwise the Action
automatically fails. If the action takes effect, the Scoring Rule
is changed appropriately at the beginning of the next Round.

[Basic stuff. Of course, the Scoring Rule can be changed in
conventional ways, but I felt it was good to have a way of easily
making changes between Rounds. Question: Should the Scorekeepor be a
competitor in the GAT?).]

*	Create a Rule with the following text:

Scoring:

	Players receive Points when certain actions are performed by
them or when certain events occur. This is the only Rule which may
define the methods of Scoring. In general, a Player may receive points
only for actions which occur during the current Round, although those
actions may depend on others which occurred previously (thus, for
example, a Player could gain points for one of eir Proposals passing,
even if the Proposal was distributed before the beginning of the
current Round.). Points are non-transferable.

	In general, a Player may receive points for a certain type of
event any number of times, unless that event has a number (N) after
it, in which case a given Player may be awarded points for that type
of event only N times in a given Round.

	If not otherwise noted, Points awarded for events referring to
"a Player" or "any Player", go to that Player. Bonuses are in addition
to the basic award. Multipliers are in lieu of the basic award.
Bonuses can be multiplied.

Responsibility for detecting changes to a Player's Score from the
following events is the responsibility of the Scorekeepor:

If a Proposal proposed by a Player passes: 5 points for first passing
Proposal by that Player in that Round, 3 for second, 1 for third, 0.5
for fourth and subsequent Proposals, +0.5 if Proposal is a Repeal, +1
if the Proposer does not Vote on the Proposal. Double points if
Proposal passes unanimously. Triple Points if the Player making the
Proposal is the only Entity who votes AGAINST.

To any Player winning a contested Election: 8 points. Double points if
Elected unanimously.

To any Player holding the most of a given currency at the end of a
Round: 8 Points per currency. Tripled if at any point during the Round
a Player had no holdings in that Currency.

To any Player tied for the most of a given currency at the end of a
Round: 5 Points per currency. Tripled if at any point during the Round
a Player had no holdings in that Currency.

To any Player holding no Currency whatsoever at the end of a Round: 5
Points.

To any Player earning no Blots during a Round: 4 Points.

To any Player having no Blots at the end of a Round: 6 Points.

To any Player voting on a Proposal: If the Player casts at least
one vote which is the same as 80% or more of the Votes cast on a
Proposal (including eir own): 1 Point, scored when the Proposal
results are announced..

To any Player voting on a Proposal: If the final tally of Votes
shows the same number of FOR votes as AGAINST votes: 2 Points,
scored when the Proposal results are announced.

To the Player Voting or declaring Presence on all Proposals of a
single distribution: 0.5 Points.


	Responsibility for detecting changes to a Player's Score from
the following events is the responsibility of the Player scoring the
Points. Changes must be reported to the Scorekeepor or the Public
Forum.

If a Rule is created containing a Player's name in the text: 15
Points.

If a Player gains a Patent Title (other than SPTs or Degrees): 4
Points (1).

To any Player receiving a Degree: 4 Points for am A.N., 6 points for a
B.N., 8 Points for a M.N., and 12 Points for a D.N.Phil or a D.N.Hist.

If a Proposal made by a Player successfully creates a Rule with a
number that is a multiple of 23: 4 Points.

If a Player submits a Proposal to the Queue that is subsequently
discarded: 5 Points (1).

To any Player Proposing an Insane Proposal for which no Entity votes
FOR: 30 Points.

To any Player who is chided for posting a single document that is not
an Official Report to a forum other than the Public Forum by more than
one Player (other than themselves): 2 Points (1).

To the third Player other than the Poster making substantive comments
to a protoproposal: 1 Point (3).

To the Player making a COE that is Responded to and admitted by the
relevant Officer (other than themselves): 1 Point (1).

To the Player Holding an Office for at least one month during the
Round, and issuing at least one Official Report: 2 Points (1)

To the Player making a Sane Proposal for which a Non-Player Voting
Entity successfully Votes: 15 points (1).

To the Player making a Senate Proposal for which a non-Senator
successfully Votes: 25 points (1).

To any Player submitting a Judgment for a CFJ which is not Appealed
before the end of the Round: 1 point.

To the Player making a CFJ which is not Judged for one month from its
original assignment: 8 Points (1 per Player per CFJ).

When an Appeal successfully overturns a Judgment, to the Players
calling for that Appeal: 2 Points

When an Appeal fails to overturn a Judgment, to the Judge who made the
original Judgment on that CFJ: 4 Points.

If three consecutive CFJs are Judged TRUE, FALSE and UNDECIDED (in any
order), to the Player making the third CFJ: 17 Points.

When a Player is Deregistered due to Silence, to the Player last
making em Silent: 5 Points.

To the Player successfully Calling for a Revolt: 15 Points.


[Any scoring system, both in the assignment of point values to actions
and in the selection of actions themselves will be arbitrary. I sought
to have a large number of scoring actions, of various levels of
difficulty. I am open to suggestions for other scoring methods.]

*	Create a Rule with the following Text:

Scoring Patent Titles

	Scoring Patent Titles (SPTs) are a subclass of Patent Titles.
They are identical to Patent Titles except that they are automatically
revoked at the end of the Round subsequent to the one for which they
were awarded. The valid SPTs, and the circumstances for which they are
awarded, are as follows:

For winning an Individual Competition in the Nth Circle, a Player
receives the SPT of 'Victor of the Nth Circle' (where Nth is replaced
by the ordinal corresponding to eir Circle number). If a Player wins
the same Circle two Rounds in succession e receives instead the SPT of
'Double Victor of the Nth Circle', for three consecutive Rounds
'Triple Victor of the Nth Circle', etc.

If two or more Players within a Circle are tied for the highest score
in a Circle at the end of a Round, they receive the SPT of
'Pseudo-Victor Nth Circle' (where Nth is replaced by the ordinal
corresponding to eir Circle number).

For being a member of a Team winning the Team Competition, a Player
receives the SPT of 'Team Victor', except for the Team Captain who
receives the SPT of "Victorious Leader"

If two or more Teams are tied for the highest Team Score at the end
of a Round, their members receive the SPT of 'Pseudo-Team Victor'

If a Player Scores enough in a Round that e would have won at least
one of the Circles higher than that in which e competed, e receives
the SPT of 'Overachiever'.

If a Player Scores so low that e would have placed last in at least
one of the Circles below eir own e receives the SPT of 'Slacker'.

[This replaces the current Champion PTs]

* Rule 755 'Champions' is hereby Repealed.

* Rule 1465 'Champion's Reward' is hereby Repealed.

* Rule 1498 'Winning by Blots' is hereby Repealed.

* Rule 1580 'Multiple Winners of a Single Game' is hereby Repealed.

* Rule 1622 'Forfeiting the Game' is hereby Repealed.

* Rule 1697 'Multiple rapid wins prohibited' is hereby Repealed.

[Clearing out the detritus of the old system. 112 is left alone for
now since repealing it now would give this Proposal an AI of 3. I
think it is best if 1638 stay as long as 112 is still on the books,
although it is irrelvant to the GAT.]

* Amend Rule 1435  'Definition of Indulgences, Blots and Immaculate'
by removing the last sentence "It is a Win-Preventing condition for a
Player to have one or more Blots."

* Amend Rule 1729 'Insanity' by replacing the last two lines with:

And should it occur (oh, need I say more?)

Easy - You get the Speaker to throw the recalcitrant Officer, or you call
for eir Impeachment, or, if all else fails, you hold a Rebellion. There
are plenty of safeguards in our system for handling this sort of thing. 
To date they have been pretty pointless, because there has been no reason
to eject an Officer from eir Office. I intend to change that.

I noticed that last time Unlimited Voting was proposed, but I held my
tongue.

A simple solution would be to limit each player to only one vote if 
voting is free. That would also please the Democrats amoung us, who would
get the option of having their precious "sanity".

I'd support this proposal if you made this change.

You should know the answer to this. You have a Proposal out to fix it.
R833 says:

      As soon as possible after the beginning of the Nomic Week,
      the Assessor shall pay out two Proposal Notes to each Player

You seem to be unfamiliar with the most recent incarnation of the points
system, proposed by Swann, which had a lot more options for scoring in
a wide variety of ways. It was still largely ignored.

Protoproposal Chaos82 [rev. 1]

Freshen 1796

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1796 be amended to read:

      (a) All Orders executed in the manner prescribed by the Rules
          for their class and type are presumed valid and enforceable.

      (b) In order for a Judge to find an Order invalid, the Judge
          must find that:
        (1) the Order was executed by a Player who the Rules did not
            permit to execute it;
        (2) the Order was executed in circumstances that neither
            required not permitted the execution of that Order; or
        (3) the Order has been rendered invalid by another Order or by
            the Rules.

      (c) A Judge who finds, during the course of judging a CFJ, that
          an Order is invalid shall vacate that Order, unless it has
          already been vacated.

      (d) Nothing in any Order shall act to prevent or hinder judicial
          review of that Order, and any portion of an Order which has
          this effect is void and without force, all other Rules
          notwithstanding.

-- 1256 --------------------------------------------------------------

APPLE I
(Creates a Rule)

  Part I: Definitions:
   An Illegal Act is any violation of the Rules, either by doing
something the Rules prohibit, or failing to perform an action mandated
by the Rules.
   A Crime or Criminal Act is any act (or failure to act) so defined
in the Rules.
   An Error is any accidental mistake or error in information distributed
to the Public Forum, e.g. miscalculation of scores, misreporting the
results of a Vote, etc. In the absence of positive proof, any such act
shall be considered an Error and not a Crime or Illegal Act.
   An Offense is any  individual instance of an Illegal Act, Crime, or
Error. If an Act is both Illegal and a Crime, such an Act shall be
considered as two Offenses.
   The Plaintiff is the Player who maks a CFJ     .
   The Defendant is the Player against whom a CFJ is made      .
   The Court is the body which decides CFJs. Identical to the Criminal
Court.
   A Penalty is anything which damages a Player's position in the game
or which provides psychological restitution, such as loss of Currency or
Offices, or a Formal Apology.
   Exception: A Penalty may be zero (i.e. no penalty)
   A Correction is a list of actions which restore the published game
state as closely as possible to that mandated by the Rules. Exception:
A Correction may only correct for the specific Offence(s) listed in the
CFJ.
      Other Rules may restrict or mandate certain Penalties and/or
Corrections, but have no effect on CFJs of events which happened before
their passage. Any changes that have occurred in the time between the
issuing of the CFJ and its delivery must be figured in to find the
correct current state.
   CFJ: A CFJ, or Call for Judgement, is a request for a formal decision
on an issue, as described below.
  Injunction: This Entity may never be issued, unless an Injunction for
a Formal Apology, as its function is replaced by these Rules.
This Rule takes precedence over Rules 451,663,669,665, and 789.

-- 1257 --------------------------------------------------------------

APPLE II
(Creates a Rule)

Each CFJ shall be decided by a Court. The Court shall consist of one
Judge, or three in the case of an Appeal.  When a CFJ is brought, the
CotC shall randomly choose the Player(s) who will be Judges of that CFJ
>from the list of eligible Players. Exception: In the case of an Appeal
the Judges shall be the Justiciar, the Clerk of the Courts, and the
Speaker, unless one or more are ineligible, in which case their
replacement shall be selected as above. Ineligible Players shall be the
Player bringing the CFJ, any Player who Judged the original CFJ in the
case of an Appeal, from 0-3 Players listed as Barred in the CFJ, the
Player who brought the original CFJ in the case of an Appeal, any
Player who has declined Judgeship, and any Players not Active or On Hold
If there are no eligible Players, all Players shall be considered
eligible. The CotC then distributes the appointments to all Players.
  A Player has three days from the distribution of the appointment to
accept or decline appointment as Judge. If a Player declines, the
position is filled as above. Players who do not respond within the three
days are considered to have declined and lose 10 points. The CotC must
then select replacement Judges for those who have declined, as above.
This Rule takes precedence over Rules 698,897,910,951, and 1005.

-- 1258 --------------------------------------------------------------

APPLE III
(Creates a Rule)

  When a Player feels an Illegal Act, Crime, or Error has been committed
within the past 14 days, e may bring this before a Court by sending
a message to the CotC stating the specific nature of the Offense(s), the
Player who is to be accused (the Defendant), and a request for
Correction and/or Penalty, if Appropriate. A CFJ may be brought
only once (excluding Appeals and a decision of Abstain) for each
Offence. No Player may submit more than five CFJ's per week.
 Exception to the above: If the Player committing an  Error corrects
 the Error, no CFJ may be brought against that Offense and any CFJ
which has already been brought against the Offense and is awaiting
Judgement is discarded and not Judged.
  A single CFJ  may be brought against multiple Offenses only if either
a) A single Player has committed multiple Offenses of the same general
nature,    b) The additional Offenses are Errors committed by the
Defendant or others which were caused by the original Offense, and/or
c) A single Act is legally considered as multiple Offenses
  If a CFJ  is brought against (an) Illegal Act(s), a Penalty and
Correction, if appropriate, must be requested for each Act.
  If a CFJ  is brought against (a) Crime(s), a Penalty must be requested
for each act. A Correction may not be requested.
  If a CFJ  is brought against (an) Error(s), a Correction must be
requested,if appropriate,for each Error. a Penalty may not be requested.
This Rule takes precedence over Rules 604,662,848, and 991.

-- 1259 --------------------------------------------------------------

APPLE IV
(Creates a Rule)

  When a CFJ  is made, the CotC shall distribute the CFJ  and all
pertinent information to all Players as soon as possible.
  Within three days of such Distribution, the Defendant may request
an alternative Penalty (if applicable). If the Defendant makes no
response within this time, he/she is considered to have proposed a
Penalty equal to zero (if applicable and legal. Otherwise, the
minimum legal Penalty is Proposed)
   The Judge then has four days to reach a decision. If a Judge feels
the Offense has indeed occurred and the Correction (if any) is
appropriate, he/she must  judge GUILTY. Conversely, if a Judge feels
the Offense has not occurred, he/she must Judge NOT GUILTY.           .
If he/she feels the Offense occurred, but an inappropriate Correction
or Penalty was proposed, he/she must Judge ABSTAIN. Judgements must be
delivered to the CotC, who shall return the decision as soon as possible
  A Penalty and/or Correction is appropriate if and only if it meets
all requirements mandated by the Rules.
  Judges must be guided by the letter of the Rules. If these are silent
or ambiguous, then Game Custom must be consulted. If this is silent
or ambiguous, only then may they consider such matters as intent,
previous Offense(s), any Repentance by the Defendant, and the best
interests of Nomic.
  If a Judge does not respond within the mandated time frame, he/she
loses the post, as well as 10 Ponts and two Marks, and the post shall be
refilled as above. The Court then has the full mandated time in which
to render a decision.
This Rule takes precedence over Rules 217,408, and 591.

-- 1260 --------------------------------------------------------------

APPLE V
(Creates a Rule)

   The decision of the majority of Judges shall be the decision of the
Court. If no decision is supported by a majority, the decision shall
be Abstain.
   If the decision is in favor of the Plaintiff, the Correction(s)      ns
requested by the Plaintiff are carried out by the appropriate Players/
Officers. If the decision is ABSTAIN, the CFJ is rejected and may be
brought again, regardless of the time elapsed since the Offense(s).
   The Judges receive 5 Points for each decision, plus two points if it
was delivered within 72 hours, unless he/she was required to choose a
Penalty, and has not done so. The Plaintiff recieves 5 Points if the
decision was in his/her favor, and loses 5 Points if not.
  After the Judge renders Judgement, if a Penalty was requested, he/she
shall choose between the Penalty requested by the Plaintiff, and that
requested by the Defendant. If the Defendant has not yet proposed a
Penalty and still may legally do so, the Judge shall wait until the
defendant does so or the time has expired, whichever comes first.
The Judge must abide by the same criteria as govern legal Judgements.
If the Judge does not choose a Penalty within three days, his/her first
Judgement stands, but a new Judge must be selected to choose a Penalty
When a Penalty is chosen, the appropriate Officers/Players shall carry
it out.
This Rule takes precedence over Rules 502 and 538.

-- 1261 --------------------------------------------------------------

APPLE VI
(Creates a Rule)

  A Player may bring a CFJ containing the Statement that a Rule which
is ambiguous or unclear be interpreted in a certain way. This
Statement must take the form of a suggested amendment to the Rule. If
the suggested amendment would correct the ambiguity and have no other
effect, the Judge must vote TRUE. If there is no ambiguity or if
the proposed amendment would not have the above effect, the Judge must
vote FALSE. If neither of the above obtain in the Judges opinion he/she
may ABSTAIN. Otherwise such CFJs  are treated like all others.
   If such a CFJ is Judged TRUE the Player bringing the CFJ may make a
Proposal amending the Rule exactly as suggested in the CFJ. If the
Player does so, and the Proposal passed, he/she receives 5 Points UNLESS
the CFJ is either being Appealed or an Appeal has overturned the CFJ.
Until such a Proposal passes or the Rule is Amended, the Rulekeepor
shall annotate the aforementioned Rule with the Statement in the CFJ
(if TRUE). While it exists, violating the annotation shall be a
Class A Crime.
 This Rule takes precedence over Rules 663 and 789.

-- 1262 --------------------------------------------------------------

APPLE VII
(Creates a Rule)

  A Player may bring a CFJ containing the statement that all or part of
a Rule is illegal or lacking in legal force. If this is the case, the
Judge must judge TRUE. If not, the Judge must judge FALSE. If the Judge
is undecided, he/she may ABSTAIN. If such a CFJ is judged TRUE the
Rule or part thereof (as specified in the CFJ) shall have no further
effect on game play and any effect it had on previous play must be
corrected to the greatest degree possible.
This Rule takes precedence over Rule 591.

-- 1263 --------------------------------------------------------------

APPLE VIII
(Creates a Rule)

  Any three Players may Appeal a decision by a Court by each posting a
request to the Public Forum within one week of that decision. The CotC
shall then appoint Judges as described above. The Judges have one week
to Judge. They must Judge OVERTURN if they feel either the CFJ or the
Judgement in question was illegal. If they feel it was legal, they must
vote SUSTAIN. If undecided, they may ABSTAIN. The decision of a majority
of the Judges is the decision of the Court. If there is no majority, the
decision is ABSTAIN. If the decision of the Court is OVERTURN, the
result of the original is changed to TRUE if FALSE, to FALSE if TRUE, to
PLAINTIFF if DEFENDANT, and to DEFENDANT if PLAINTIFF. The decision of
an Appeal Court cannot be Appealed, unless the decision was ABSTAIN.
If, as a result of the Appeal Court's decision, a Penalty is now
required, the Judges shall select a Penalty as above, and the Penalty
selected by the majority shall be put into effect.
This Rule takes precedence over Rules 591 and 911.

Thank you, thank you. I lost my APPLE files when we switched
mainframes here, and I feared it was lost forever.

Anyone know the numbers of Swann's scoring rules? Anyone know
where I can get them? How long were they in effect?

Protoproposal Chaos43 [rev. 7]

Unlimited Voting

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 206 be amended to read:

      (a) A Voting Entity is an Entity which is generally authorized
          by the Rules to cast a vote or votes on a Proposal.  Other
          Rules may withdraw this authorization from a Voting Entity
          in specific circumstances without that Entity thereby
          ceasing to be a Voting Entity.  Only those Entities
          designated by the Rules to be Voting Entities are Voting
          Entities.

      (b) No Entity is permitted to vote on a Proposal unless it is a
          Voting Entity.

      (c) Players and Groups are Voting Entities.

      (d) Unless otherwise specified, each Voting Entity may cast an
          unlimited number of Votes on a Proposal.

Be it further resolved, that Rules 1660, 1765 and 1465 be repealed.

| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1442 be amended, by appending a
| paragraph reading, "If the voting cost for a Proposal is zero, then
| each Voting Entity may cast only one Vote on that Proposal."
