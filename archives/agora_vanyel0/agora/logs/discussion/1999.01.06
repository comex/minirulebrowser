Dear Steve,

I had posted some comments on my budget when I published it. I hope yu
don't mind if I just repost them instead of rewording them.

When I published the budget, I wrote:
>>
...[snip]

It still
seems fair to me not to punish too badly those players who used and
supported the groups and contest stuff by giving money to these
entities. This is why I kept the (small) VT holdings of groups I'm not
involved with at roughly their last reported level, while I more than
halved the holdings of those I am involved with.

  [rechecking the calculation I think this should have read 'nearly
   halved' instead of 'more than halved']

I will have to give the groups' and contests' money to the members of
these, and yes, that makes the Order's members look very good in
comparison to others. But that is just because of the location these
players chose to keep their money. In an attempt to respect Steve's
remark, though, I have given some more VTs to players with large
personal VT holdings in the last report, taking these VTs from those
allotted to the MBC and the Order in my first budget..

So here's my new budget:

          base(3)  (1)   (2)

>Andre       1.5              = 1.5
>Blob        5   + 1   + 1    = 7       
>Chuck       2.1              = 2.1
>Crito       5   + 0.5 + 1    = 6.5
>elJefe      1.7              = 1.7
>G. Chaos    1.7              = 1.7
>Kolja A.    6.6              = 6.6
>lee         3.1 + 0.5        = 3.6
>Macross     3.1 + 1.5        = 4.6
>Michael     2.1 + 1   + 1    = 3.1
>Morendil    1.5       + 0.5  = 2
>Murphy      2.1       + 0.5  = 2.6
>Oerjan      1.5              = 1.5
>Peekee      3                = 3
>Proglet     1.5 - 1          = 0.5
>Steve       1.7 - 1   + 0.5  = 1.2

remarks: 

(1) are deviations from the average, based on similar deviations in
the last report. In this report, most players had around 5 VTs. This
translates into the basis 1.5 VTs for each player. Those who had
significantly more or less than 5 VTs get something like 20% of the
difference in this column.

(2) is a small reward for office holders. Salaries were 0 for most of
the time, but a token reward seems to be favoured by many players.

(3) The base now includes reimbursement for the holdings of groups and
contests players are involved with: 0.2 Vts each for Threat members,
0.6 VTs for X group, 1.6 VTs for MBC members, and (only !) 3.5 VTs for
Order Priests - each of us Priests loses a lot in this.

I have given Peekee 3 VTs instead of the usual basis of 1.5, because I
suspect e'll lose the 5 VTs e gets as a new player due to timing
issues. I would also like to remind all other prospective Treasurors
to remember Peekee in eir budgets, and Peekee (welcome in the game,
btw), remember to vote only for a Treasuror who doesn't ignore you!

Looking at eGroups, I find that the win.tue.nl backup list is already being
archived there.

Steve,

"Not much room to maneuver with the 50 VT limit, but this is somewhat
proportional to the last Accountor's report I have, with adjustments made
for Group holdings and giving everyone a minimum of 2 VTs."

This is from my original posting of my budget.

You seem to have missed POI138.  Just thought I'd warn you, since that
one will kick off a PI Infraction next week.

Interestingly enough, if everyone votes purely out of self-interest,
to get the maximum number of VTs, then Crito will win by a mile, having
8 votes to my 5 to Kolja's 3.

But if players vote to maximise their Groups' holdings things change
drastically. I would then have 8 votes, Kolja 5 and Crito only 3.

Blob

BTW: When did the X-Group gain three players? I don't remember that.
Hsm... I don't like missing important facts like that. I should read 
my Notary's Reports more closely.
