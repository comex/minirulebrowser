  While it's annoying enough not be listed as Zeitgeist since the
award was snatched away from me by Chuck milliseconds after I got it,
I note for the second time that I am not listed as a "Boor", even
thought I earned that distinction two Wizard reports ago.  Thanks!

Fixed.  The appropriate lines of the report now read: 

> Boor:             General Chaos, Macross, Murphy, Sherlock, elJefe,

These are all those people who have negative styles in the latest
Wizard's report. 

Thanks for pointing out my error.

Right.  It's time to make Disinterest meaningful again.

I'm not so sure I know what all the fuss is about. It may cost 3 VTs 
to pass a "trivial" proposal, but you get 2 VTs back as a reward for
getting it passed. How much cheaper do you want it to be? If you made
it Disinterested, so that you only had to spend 1 VT to pass it, and
you waived the rewards, then you would not end up any better off. 
When potential Zeitgeist rewards are added, you'd be better off not
making your proposal Disinterested at all.

I also don't like the old Disinterest scheme because too many
non-trivial proposal were being made Disinterested in order to make
them easier to pass. If you really want to disambiguate between 
"trivial" and "non-trivial" proposals, why not make it so that a 
player can declare eir Proposal to be Disinterested Without Objection?
If someone objects, then it must be taken that the proposal was not
as uncontraversial as the author assumed.

I urge you not to give up so easily. Remember that you receive 2 VTs
reward for a successful proposal, and that you don't need to pay out
the VTs for voting until _after_ the voting period is over, by which
time you should have received this reward. That is supposing that the
proposal is as likely to pass as you think it is.
