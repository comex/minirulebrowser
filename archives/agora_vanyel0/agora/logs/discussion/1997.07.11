One, you have it backward: Transfer Orders satisfy Payment Orders.
Two, as other have noted, it is not clear that a Proposal can create a
nomic entity, which means that a Proposal cannot create a Payment
Order, and a Proposal lacks authority to command Players to execute
Payment Orders on its own.  Hence, I do not believe that a Proposal
can, by itself, cause the execution of Payment or Transfer Orders.  I
would somewhat like to see this rectified.

However, P/C will not prevent the use of direct manipulations of
currencies held by entities.  Note, however, that Treasuries will not
exist after P/C (assuming it passes); Players should keep this in mind
when drafting Proposals.

I'm sorry that I have to ask this, but unfortunately during the

ma a copy of the proto introducing mines, farms etc to produce
VTs and the like?

I must admit I'm a little surprized to hear you, of all players, say
that after the anti-war campaigning you have done. If it wasn't for
the "nomicality" of the players involved, the whole enterprize you
disliked could hardly have been considered an "invasion" or a "war
effort" at all, could it? - maybe as the malicious action of a player,
or a group of players.

But the danger of players joining a Nomic with bad intentions has
nothing to do with inter-nomic relations. It is present because (and
as long as) nomics run via open mailing lists or other open systems
that are hard to protect against such attacks. (Of course this is an
interesting problem, too: how to organize an immigration policy that
protects you from evildoers, but does not keep people from joining. In
Agora the senate provides for that, I think),

Morendil:
>>I wouldn't like any restriction, however benign in intent, on my
rights to circulate freely within the Nomic Community.<<

My idea is not to restrict registrations in any way, just to force
people to publish their nomic memberships. It would only allow
individual nomics to introduce such restrictions internally. But they
can do that already, and why shouldn't they be allowed to do it?

I don't see in which way my idea conflicts with your goal that

>>...a Nomic should be free to adopt any kind of immigration policy it
likes, provided naturally that the basic rights of the Players are
respected by its legislation.
If Rishon wants to subject immigrant Players to a detailed questionnaire,
so be it - I certainly don't approve, but neither do I think such a move
would be unfounded in light of recent events. ;)<<

Morendil:
>>Note though that IN Points are really less than exciting - member
Nomics seem to care little for them.<<

I don't mind that too much - it's just like real life, isn't it? Some
nations can be condemned by UN resolutions over and over again, but
they just don't care. And not all of them automatically loose their
reputation or status, either, if they are interresting or powerful
enough to ignore the UN's "sanctions".

I think that's a very interesting part of international politics - you
do want a forum for exchange, and you do want to fix some elementary
standards and a kind of code of conduct for all, but the means to
enforce such standards are very limited indeed - basically limited to
persuasion and moral pressure. Why should Internomic be different?

Here is the version that Blob posted on 9 June. I don't know whether it
is the most current version.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

PROTO: Plots v0.2

------------

This is a combined effort by Antimatter and myself, at creating some form
of economy around here. The basic aim is the same as my earlier Jobs 
proto - to encourage Players to specialise in the production of one of
our major currencies - VTs, P-Notes or Indulgences - and then trade their
excess for other currencies.

The concept we are working with is that of land ownership and building
various structures on your land, to produce the various commodities. A
unit of land is a Plot. Each player starts with 3 of these, but they can
be traded. On a Plot, a player can build a Structure. Every week, a
Structure produces a certain amount of a given currency, depending on its
type. Houses produce P-Notes, Farms produce VTs, Churches (indirectly)
produce Indulgences, there are also Mines, which produce a new currency
call Materials, which is necessary for creating & maintaining Structures.

A player must pay monthly upkeep on eir Structures, or else they fall 
apart. Upkeep is paid in Materials, and is 1 Mt/month for each Structure,
plus 1 extra Mt for each type of Structure owned. So 3 Farms cost 4 Mt/month,
and 1 Farm, 1 House and 1 Mine costs 6 Mt, etc - this is arranged so as to
encourage specialisation. (But note that 1 Farm & 2 Mines is a self-supporting
arrangement, which provides a (meagre) supply of VTs and a slight excess
of Mts, for any Player who does not want to get involved in trading, but
still wants to be able to vote and pay eir rent.)

This is still an early draft - more an explanation of the idea than an 
actual proposal. We would appreciate any input on the following:

1) Plots as a currency - we want the number of Plots in the system to be
relatively constant, but we also need to provide new Players with Plots.
I do not want there to ever be any entity with a negative Plots holding.
The best way I can see to do this, is to work Plots like the Kudo system.
When a new player joins, 3 Plots are created & given to em. When e leaves
all eir Plots are destroyed. The problem is that this is scammable, by 
getting new players to join, transfer their plots to you, and then leave.

2) Timing of transfers & reporting, in order to streamline this as much 
as possible.

3) Tuning the economy

Constructive criticisms are very welcome.

------------

Create a rule titled "Plots" reading:

   Plots are a currency. The recordkeeper of Plots is the Cartographer.

   Whenever a Player joins the game for the first time, e recieves 3 Plots.

Create a rule titled "Material" reading:

   Material is a currency. The recordkeeper of Material is the Cartographer. 
   Material may be abbreviated as Mt.

   Whenever a Player joins the game for the first time, e recieves 10 Mt.

Each current player recieves 3 Plots and 10 Mt.

Amend rule 1710 by to read:

   There is an Office of Cartographor. The Cartographor recieves a salary 
   equal to 2 times the Basic Officer Salary.

   At least once each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall post a Report to the 
   Public Forum containing the following information: 

    * all Locations, and which Locations are Adjacent to which others
    * the Location of all Entities that have a Location
    * all Movement since the previous report (if any)
    * the current status of all Plots in the game, and the changes (if any)
      since the previous report
    * the current status of all Material in the game, and the changes (if any) 
      since the previous report
    * the status of all Plots and Material possessed by all former Players
      at the time they left the game

Create a rule titled "Structures" reading:

   Each plot may have one Structure on it, or be empty. Only those Structures 
   exist which are defined in the rules. The Structure on a plot is part of
   that plot's status.

   The following Structures exist:
    * Farms
    * Churches
    * Mines
    * Houses

   A Player may build a Structure of eir choice on an empty Plot e possesses 
   by informing the Cartographor that e is building the Structure and paying 
   5 Mt, which are destroyed.

   A Player may tear down a Structure on one of eir Plots by informing the 
   Cartographor that e is tearing down the structure. When a Player tears 
   down a Structure, the Plot becomes empty, and 2 Mt are created and given
   to the Player.

Create a rule titled "Upkeep on Structures" reading:

   Each Structure requires an upkeep. The upkeep cost is 2 Mt for the first 
   Structure of each type that a Player owns, and 1 Mt for each additional 
   structure. The upkeep is paid automatically on the 1st of every month. 
   However, if a player does not have enough Mt to pay the upkeep on all of 
   eir Structures, e has one week to pay the upkeep on eir structures or 
   all of eir Structures collapse and are destroyed.

Create a rule titled "Production from Structures" reading:

   Structures may produce something each week. The production from Structures 
   takes place at the time of the Cartographor's weekly report. The items 
   produced by Structures are as follows:

    * Farms produce 5 VT
    * Houses produce 1 P-Note
    * Mines produce 1 Mt

   Churches do not produce anything. However, each Church is considered to 
   be two players for the purposes of randomly allocating Indulgences, and 
   any Indulgences which would be given to the Church are instead given to 
   the Church's owner.

   The Cartographor shall detect and report all currency transfers required
   by this rule.

Amend rule 833 by removing the text:

   At the end of the Voting Period for a Proposal, if a Proposal has received
   more FOR Votes than AGAINST Votes, the Payor for that Proposal gains a 
   number of P-Notes equal to the number of FOR Votes less the number of 
   AGAINST Votes.

   If, however, a Proposal has received more AGAINST Votes than FOR Votes, 
   that Payor loses a number of P-Notes equal the number of AGAINST Votes 
   less the number of FOR Votes.

   If the number of FOR Votes and AGAINST Votes are equal, the Payor neither
   gains nor loses P-Notes as a result of this Rule.

Repeal rule 947. [P-Notes for ruleset reduction]

Repeal rule 1705. [P-Notes for style]

Repeal rule 1684. [VT Supply]

Don't misunderstand - I'm not saying there should be no such notion as
Nomicality. I am a 'nomizen' of Agora; other Agora Players are nomizens
of various other Nomics in addition. What I was stating was my opposition
to the notion of enacting any Rules that would place different requirements
upon Players, solely based upon the Nomicality, or lack thereof, of the
Players involved. I want to have the right to join a Nomic without having
to state other Nomic-related (or for that matter non-Nomic-related)
affiliations. I should not have to disclose any information about myself
when joining a Nomic other than my name and email address.

That _is_ a restriction. And your idea was to _require_ Players of
member Nomics to do that, not merely to allow member Nomics to adopt
such policies, which as you rightly point out they can do anyway.
Since I don't want Agora to adopt such a policy, I'd have to oppose
it on the IN level.

It doesn't - it's a different issue. On the InterNomic level I want to
preserve the right of member Nomics to restrict immigration however
they want, because I think it would be harmful to IN as a whole to
attempt to place such restrictions on member Nomics; on a local level
I'm against any immigration policy at all.

I don't believe that's quite true - enforcement can be quite effective
with such tools as economic sanctions, embargoes and the like, for
instance.

Proto: Unequal stipends to drive the economy

-----
Idea: In the Plots proto Blob and Antimatter want to create not only a
scarce supply of currency, but also an unequally distributed one, to
make the economy more interesting. 

However, they do more than that: they also introduce an economic
background simulation. This may be fun in itself, but seems to me very
much like MUDding (or playing a computer game like SimCity or
whatever) by hand.

While I fully support the first goal I don't feel like spending a lot
of time micromanaging my "real estate". This is a strategic problem in
game design (for example, a very important one for ConSims): do you
want it to be results oriented or simulation oriented? Both aspects
can be fun, but for the latter the paperwork must compare favorably to
the entertainment gained - in the case of the Plots proto I don't
think it does. 

So I would suggest the same incentive to trade currencies, and thus to
have more of an economy, can be introduced in a much simpler way if we
cut the simulation aspect and focus on the desired result: how to give
unequal amounts of currency to each player.

This proto would introduce a stipend of both P-notes and VTs as
(nearly ?) the only source of these currencies in addition to
officers' salaries. Inequalitiy is introduced by giving a much higher
stipend to players who "specialize" in one of the two currencies. On
the other hand, one can choose a small, but balanced income to avoid
trading (just as one can build 1 Farm & 2 Mines to be self-supporting
in the Plots proto).

I am sure the detailed amounts of income need a lot of finetuning - I
just lack the experience for this - comments anyone?. I have based my
first suggestion on the following estimate:

On average (over players and time), every player needs a little less
than one P-note per week, and about three VTs. (Dear assessor and
promotor, is that a good estimate in your experience?)

So we need to introduce 3*N VTs and N P-notes into the game each week,
where N is the number of active players. Roughly N VTs are given out
as salaries, the rest must come from stipends.

I did not want to make the stipends noninteger amounts of currency,
esp. as the MUQ for P-notes is one, so I decided to pay them only
fortnightly - this way more finetuning of the amounts is possible.

------
Proto:

Every two weeks every player receives a stipend of either VTs or
P-notes or both.

There are three types of stipend: balanced, VT only or P-note only. A
player must choose which type of stipend e wants to receive. This
choice can be changed by notifying ??; the change only becomes valid
four weeks after this notification.

After the adoption of this rule every player must make this choice for
the first time and notify ?? As Soon As Possible. Players who fail to
do so start with a balanced stipend. This paragraph will remove itself
10 days after the adoption of this rule.

A balanced stipend consists of 1 P-note and 4 VTs.
A VT only stipend consists of 9 VTs.
A P-note only stipend consists of 4 P-notes.

(Missing: who pays these?)

Amend rule 833 by removing the text:

   At the end of the Voting Period for a Proposal, if a Proposal has received
   more FOR Votes than AGAINST Votes, the Payor for that Proposal gains a 
   number of P-Notes equal to the number of FOR Votes less the number of 
   AGAINST Votes.

   If, however, a Proposal has received more AGAINST Votes than FOR Votes, 
   that Payor loses a number of P-Notes equal the number of AGAINST Votes 
   less the number of FOR Votes.

   If the number of FOR Votes and AGAINST Votes are equal, the Payor neither
   gains nor loses P-Notes as a result of this Rule.

Repeal rule 1684. [VT Supply]

------
Pro's: 

- Introduces the same effect (scarce and unequally distributed
currency incomes) as the Plots proto, but with much less paperwork
(especially for each player, but also for the officer(s) supervising
the stipends) 

- Changes and readjustments are easy to implement. For example it may
turn out that too few (or too many) units of one currency are
circulating. This would either stifle the game (or make the economy
ineffective in creating scarcity and trade). But a simple rule change
can adjust the income provided by stipends. Or an additional rule
could limit the overall circulation of some currency and raise taxes
to pay the stipends, as I suggested some time ago.

Adjustments like that would be much harder to implement in an economy
driven by private property like plots and production facilities;
changing their effectiveness would not only be more difficult than
changing stipends technically, it would also be frustrating for
players who invested a lot of effort into getting eir businesses
running.

Con's:

- We loose the fun and excitement of running an economy simulation
within Agora as a whole; individual players loose the possibility to
be proud owners of a well run business and trade organization.

- Whatever else you can think of.

Open questions:

- Who is responsible for paying the stipends and for keeping a list of
who gets which stipend? We could either introduce a new office for
this, or split the task: The assessor stays responsible for the VT
part of the stipends, the promotor for the P-notes.

- We may want to keep Rules 947 and 1705, after all. In an environment
of scarce P-notes they may even make more of a difference than
now. Then we would have some extra source for VTs (salaries) and for
P-notes(R 947 & 1705). The old main sources of VTs and P-notes from
Rule 1684 and 833 must be abolished, of course.

Remarks:

- It might be nice to change some officers' salaries to be paid in
P-notes to introduce some variety. On the other hand, then every
officer could collect eir salary in one currency and eir stipend in
the other, avoiding the need to trade. 

- Needs some technical polishing if Pragmatic Currencies go through,
of course.

I hope the developers and supporters of the Plots concept see this as
a constructive challenge, not as a personal attack on all the nice
toys they have devised (this is _not_ meant to sound ironic - I
have fiddled around with homemade economy simulations, too, and I
think I know how much fun - and work - it is).

This idea is not new: it's the essence of the Jobs proto that someone,
Blob I think, was floating some time back.

Ask Blob; he did the computations for this a while ago.

I'd rather limit obligations to Rules and SLCs.  How many different

I would limit the ability of Proposals to create obligations to a
single performance of some duty (as opposed to a repeating or ongoing
obligation), and with a time limit of probably two weeks after the
adoption of the Proposal.

It would have been difficult to recast Rule 1687 into the new
paradigm; it violates the principle that units of Currency are only
transferred when their owner causes them to be transferred, amongst
other things.  Furthermore, one of the basic goals of Pragmatic
Currencies is to make Currency Recordkeeping much less error-prone and
far more straightforward.  I do not believe that Rule 1687's measures
are necessary in the paradigm proposed by Pragmatic Currencies.
