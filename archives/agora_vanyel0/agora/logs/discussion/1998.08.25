Well, have there been any confirmed instances of you pinging new
Officers for FtR less than a week after they had assumed their new
positions? It doesn't happen that often: new Officers tend to be keen to
make a good start in the job. I can't recall you doing it. But if you
have, and can identify the cases, just vacate the relevant Payment
Orders. This is a kind of case Pragmatic Currencies handles well.

Even under your hypothetical, I would still say that the Rules have an
intrinsic ability to take precedence or to defer, but that your hypothetical
rule modifies or nullifies this ability.  Just like a Rule has an intrinsic
ability to set the value of Foo, but another Rule may override that.  But then,
maybe we are disagreeing about the meaning of "intrinsic" and I wouldn't be
surprised if my concept of it was too fuzzy.  8)

I would like to point out that Steve seems to have accepted my argument that
Ratification Without Objection is not an Instrument and therefore is not
prohibited by R1550.  I'm working under the assumption that the Herald's Report
was successfully ratified.

Well, philosophers have filled libraries with volumes attempting to give
analyses of just what the concept of something's being 'instrinsic'
comes to. But mostly they're trying to capture the idea of one or
another kind of independence.

It seems to me that what a Rule has intrinsically is the ability to make
*claims* about various matters: the value of Foo, its precedence with
respect to other Rules. But the *success* of those claims is an
extrinsic matter, since it depends on other Rules.
