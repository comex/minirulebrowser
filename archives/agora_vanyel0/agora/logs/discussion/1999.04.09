The only person who has been hurling insults around here lately, Scott,
is you. I have carefully refrained from insulting you even once, since I
want to keep the debate civilized. Thus, there hasn't been an
"escalating war of insults", despite your frequent atempts to start one.

That doesn't mean we have to make it easy to adopt Proposals which would
be destructive. And Summary Adoption has made it a very great deal
easier to get such a Proposal adopted.

But in order for this failure to be important, the Proposal will
independently need to have the means to pass.

My argument for paying out Salaries to the Justiciar was that at that time,
R910 said "The Justiciar does not receive a fixed weekly salary." This has

Here is the CFJ. But, as I already stated, it is in my opinion based on an
old version of the text of Rule 910, and because of that, does not apply
anymore.

==========================================================================
                               CFJ 1116

  The VT Payment Order labeled "RVTPO 822" in message "Message-Id:
  <199902031535.QAA07830@wsinfm15.win.tue.nl> Subject: OFF: Officer
  Salaries" (salary paid to Justiciar Crito) was improperly executed.

==========================================================================

Called by:           Crito

Judge:               Murphy
Judgement:           FALSE

Judge selection:

Eligible:            Chuck, elJefe, Kolja. A, Morendil, Murphy, Peekee, 
                     Steve, Vlad

Not eligible:
Caller:              Crito
Barred:              Andre
Had their turn:      Ørjan, Macross, Blob, General Chaos
Already served:      -
Defaulted:           -
By request:          -
On Hold:             Ørjan, lee

==========================================================================

History:

  Called by Crito:                         Thu, 04 Feb 1999 13:38:42 -0500
  Assigned to Murphy:                      Fri, 05 Feb 1999 23:04:48 +1100
  Judged FALSE by Murphy:                  Tue, 09 Feb 1999 01:05:56 -0800
  Judgement published:                     as of this message

==========================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

R910 states "The Justiciar does not receive a fixed weekly salary."
R1007 states "Unless otherwise specified, the Salary for an Office
              shall be equal to the Basic Salary."

I contend that the above statement in R910 constitutes a specification
of the salary for the Justiciar.  Because the (lack of) salary is
specified in R910, the above statement in R1007 prevents it from setting
the salary of the Justiciar to the Basic Salary.  I should remind the
Judge that if e were to find this CFJ TRUE, e must then vacate the
referenced Payment Order.

==========================================================================
Judge's Arguments:

I Judge the statement FALSE.  "X does not exist" is not equivalent to "X
is zero".  For a concrete example, consider these hypothetical Rules:

     Rule 3000A
     The Justiciar's Salary is zero VTs.

     Rule 3000B
     The Justiciar's Salary is one VT.

Clearly 3000A and 3000B conflict.  But the relevant clause of 910/6 does
not conflict with 3000B, so it cannot be equivalent to 3000A.

There has yet to be a proposal passed by SA. Frankly, with you around, it's
downright impossible to pass a proposal by SA, not "easy."

Protoproposal Chaos54 [rev. 6]

Zero Payment Orders

Be it resolved, that Rule 1599 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever a Rule requires a Player to execute a Payment
          Order, e shall do so within seven days of when the
          requirement arises.

      (b) The foregoing does not apply to any requirement to execute a
          Payment Order for zero units of any Currency.  Such Payment
          Orders need not be executed, any Rule to the contrary
          notwithstanding.

Since this is up for a vote, you should probably remove it from the script.
