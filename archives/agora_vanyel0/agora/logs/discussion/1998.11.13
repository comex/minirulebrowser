It seems as if matching TOs to POs is shifted from the Recordkeepor to
individual creditors, and the amount of bookkeeping is otherwise
unchanged.  Is this an improvement?  Won't this lack of tracking lead
to difficulty unraveling the Gamestate when a dispute does arise?  Why
not just allow a single TO (for, say, 3 VTs) to pay multiple POs (3 of
1 VT each)?

I'll be sending out a second Probate proto shortly.

Proto:  Probate (v2.0)

Rename Rule 1755 ("No Non-Player Responsiblilities") to "No Non-Player
Responsibilities", and amend it by replacing "executor in probate" with
"trustee".

Amend Rule 1601 ("Probate") to read:

      A Monied Entity is one possessing Currency, or named as the payor or
      payee of a Payment Order that has been neither satisfied nor vacated.

      The Notary shall place in Probate any Monied Entity without an
      Executor, as soon as possible after being made aware of this
      condition.  The Notary may remove any entity from Probate.  These
      actions shall be announced in the Public Forum.

      No Monied Entity may be destroyed, any Rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding.

      The following definitions apply with respect to entities in Probate:

      * Credit:  a Payment Order naming the entity in Probate as payee.
      * Debt:  a Payment Order naming the entity in Probate as payor.
      * Creditor:  the payee of a debt.
      * Debtor:  the payor of a credit.

Amend Rule 1637 ("Wills") to read:

      An entity may file a Will by sending it to the Notary.  This replaces
      the entity's previous Will, if any.  The Notary shall maintain a list
      of all current Wills, and provide it upon request.

Rename Rule 1738 ("Executors in Probate") to "Trustees", and amend it to
read:

      The Notary shall assign a Trustee to any entity in Probate that does
      not have one.  A Trustee may resign at any time, and the Notary may
      remove a Trustee at any time.  These actions shall be announced in
      the Public Forum.

      An entity's Trustee may, Without Objection, perform any of the
      following actions:

      * Execute a Transfer Order from the entity in Probate to any other
          entity.
      * For any credit of the entity in Probate, execute a Payment Order
          for the same amount from the debtor to another entity.
      * Vacate any credit or debt of the entity in Probate.

      The Trustee is encouraged, but not required, to act according to the
      following Probate Code:

        1) Pay creditors, to the extent possible.  Each Currency's
             Mintor has lowest priority with respect to that Currency.
        2) Act according to the entity's Will, if any.
        3) Cancel all remaining debts and credits.
        4) Transfer all Currencies to their respective Mintors.
        5) Remove the entity from Probate, ideally with no credits, debts,
             or Currency holdings.

Repeal Rule 1757 ("Implementation of Probate Plans").

It looks like RL will now prevent me from getting

dangerously close to Dereliction of Duty.  Unfortunately, it

This is not true.  An entity could elect, consistent with these rules,
to lump all debts together as long as e never assesses late penalties
or tries to collect.  Or e could keep track of debts individual until
the time they become overdue, but lump all overdue debts together.
(This is probably what I'll do.)  Any system that ensures that one
never assesses a late penalty on a debt before it is overdue, or more
than once every seven days after it becomes overdue, is permitted.  If
you're willing to forgo or delay late penalties, you can simplify your
tracking system to almost any extent you desire.  (You could even
choose not to keep track of your debts at all, in which case you might
have trouble proving that you are owed them, but that's up to you.)

Disregarding terminological changes, my proposal would allow this: any
payment made is applied to all outstanding debts, in order from oldest
to newest.  It also allows payments of debts which have not yet been
assessed (the receiving entity is required to credit overpayments to
the payor's account).

I don't believe that disputes will lead to any particular difficulty
in "unraveling" records, since the success of a transfer is never
contingent upon the purpose of that transfer.  Besides, I have certain
structural goals (in areas of dispute resolution, proof, and the role
of the judiciary) which this system may tend further; thus, I view the
shifting of burden from recordkeepors in the normal course of
business, to judges only when disputes arise, as interesting and
ultimately beneficial.

I think your suggestions go too far.  By allowing Trustees to do
whatever they want, you defeat the purpose of having Probate at all.
Nothing prohibits Trustees from merely dumping the entire assets of
the estate into eir own bank account.  If I was nominated Trustee
under the system you propose, I would certainly do exactly that.

Protoproposal Chaos67 [rev. 2]

Eliminate ASAP I

| Be it therefore resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:
| 
|     (a) Whenever the Rules require a Player to perform some duty
|         after the occurence of an event, and specifies a time limit
|         for doing so, the failure of that Player to perform the duty
|         within that time limit in no way abates that Player's
|         obligation to perform that duty, unless the Rule which
|         imposes that obligation specifies otherwise.
| 
|     (b) Whenever the Rules require a Player to perform some duty at
|         least once within any given time interval (such as once each
|         week, or each month), and that Player fails to do so, e is
|         not obligated to do so twice during the next such time
|         period, unless the Rule which imposes that obligation
|         specifies otherwise.
| 
| Be it further resolved, that Rule 208 be amended to read:

      (a) The Assessor shall publish all the Votes cast upon a
          Proposal within seven days of the end of that Proposal's
          Voting Period.

      (b) The Assessor shall not publish the Votes cast on a Proposal
          prior to the time e publishes the Votes cast on:
        (1) all Proposals whose Voting Periods ended before that of
            the Proposal in question, and
        (2) all Proposals whose Voting Periods ended at the same time
            as the Proposal in question and which have a lower number.

I can field that one. From Aug 1 up to the distribution of P3794-3795,
G. Chaos cast 1 vote for P3785 (assessed as aaa310) and 1 vote for 3787
(aaa318).
