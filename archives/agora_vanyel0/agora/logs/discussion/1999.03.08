Of course, we could allow the Bank to take out loans with willing

I think it has considerably more potential for interesting interaction
than the present system, which mainly seems to be an exercise in
trying to find the right parameters to a chaotic system so as to
prevent it from entering a runaway state.

That's why I said it was not a good solution. I'd rather raise the VTCL
and then increase the tariff appropriately in April, to balance the supply.

Well, actually I think that the other problem I pointed out might be 
sufficient check. The Chancelllor can levy unfair taxes, but if e does
so, e runs the risk that people will refuse to pay them, leaving em
with bad bank debts.

The only thing I would add is a restriction which prevents em from 
levying taxes in greatly in excess of what is needed to cover current
debts. Taxes should only be enough to cover real debts.

There already are such advantages.  If you make a proposal--and
increase its priority by one when you submit it--shortly after
the start of the month, you have nearly two months before its
priority is reduced.  If you do that near the end of the month,
you have only a little over one month.

/verbose on

There are several issues that I feel need to be addressed in this case.

The first concerns the meaning of "legal significance".  Before this CFJ
I had taken a rather simplistic view of this phrase, but now I see that
there can be at least two different categories of "legal significance"
within Agora.  One is the very strict category of items that have
"legal significance" as explicitly defined by the Rules.  Another is the
rather loose category of items that have "legal significance" by virtue
of their relationship to entities defined by the Rules.  The case at hand
provides an excellent example for this distinction, namely, appellations.
The official proposal number is an appellation directly defined by the
Rules and therefore has legal significance of the strict kind.
However, there is nothing that prevents a proposer or Promotor
from associating another appellation with a Proposal which can then
take on legal significance of the looser kind, since this appellation
can be used by Players to cause changes in the game state
(i.e. by using it to cast votes).

If we were to disallow anything to have legal significance other
than the strict kind, Morendil's judgement would be without question
correct.  Only one Proposal had the strictly legal designation of 3830
and by referring to that number in eir post, Vlad, intending it or not,
could only be referring to the original P3830.  However, I think we
have strong game custom, as well as the best interests of the game,
in considering the second, looser form of legal significance to be valid.
When Promotor G.Chaos attempted to reassign 3830 to the new
proposal, e temporarily created an appellation for P3833 that was
identical to the official appellation of P3830.  Of course, at this point
3830 became ambiguous as to which Proposal it actually referred.
This brings us to the second issue - what is the significance of an
ambiguous voting message?

Unfortunately, the Rules are less clear here than I would like.  R683 does
not explicitly say that a Player's vote must unambiguously refer to a
particular Proposal.  It merely says that a Player votes on a Proposal
when e informs the Assessor that e is voting on "that Proposal".  I see
three possible interpretations when the reference to a Proposal is ambiguous:

1.  The voting message actually cast a vote on *both* Proposals.
2.  The voting message is invalid, since it does not specify explicitly
     what "that Proposal" is.
3.  The Assessor resolves the ambiguity, or invalidates the message
     at eir own discretion.

The more I think about it, the more I am inclined to believe that the strict
letter of the law would require interpretation 1.  However, I also think that
this is a case where it is unambigously clear that Vlad's intention was
to cast a single vote on a single Proposal, and so I am inclined to take
this into account and discard option 1.  That is to say, Vlad clearly
only cast one vote and the Rules do not allow a single vote to be
split between more than one Proposal.

Although I think 2 may be a reasonable interpretation (and indeed has
been argued as such by others), I am not yet convinced that it carries
more weight than interpretation 3.  And, since it gives me the chance
to set some legal precedent (or maybe at least spark some interesting
debate), I will focus my decision on this interpretation.

Clearly, Assessor Blob operated under interpretation 3 in
determining that the ambiguity should be resolved  by strictly
adhering to the letter of the law regarding Proposal numbers.
(This, of course, assumes you accept the argument that
there *was* ambiguity in the message.  At the time of eir
actions, I suspect Blob did not think so, but that is irrelevant).
Assuming that Blob was within eir right to do this, what then
is the role of the Courts in this case?

One might say that since the Rules did not prevent Blob
from exercising eir own judgement in resolving an ambiguity,
we should just let it stand and live with it.  But I think Players
should have a reasonable recourse against such determinations
that work to their detriment.  So, I will take this opportunity
to either establish new or add to existing precedent that the
role of the Courts is to review such actions and to uphold
or rectify them (as much as possible).  It is my opinion that the
Courts should not overturn such actions unless there is compelling
reason to do so.  In this case, I think there are such compelling
reasons because, IMO, it is in the best interests of the game that:

    a) Players should be able to operate under the reasonable assumption
        that official reports and announcements are correct.  In other words,
        although it is their right to double-check and question the validity
        of official messages, it should not be a *requirement* to do so.
    b) As much as possible, errors made by one Player should not
        irreversibly negatively impact other Players.

To accept Blob's actions as Assessor in this case would run counter
to both of the above principles.  Since the outcome of this analysis
leads to the same conclusion has accepting interpretation 2, I will
leave arguments in it's favor in the hands of the other Justices.

Therefore, I hereby vote to overturn Morendil's judgement and return
a judgement of TRUE.

Is it just me, or is anyone else disturbed by these voting results?
Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered by the results, but I can't think
this reflects well on Agora's health.

I'm not sure what disturbs you, but I've been disturbed for some time
by results that are almost consistently unanimous passage.  Aside
from the fact that Zeitgeist is pretty much meaningless, I fear that
there may be very strong pressure against making a serious effort to
get proposals distributed unless they have universal support (or
at least universal non-opposition).  In the long run, I think this
bodes ill for Agora's health.  I'm just hoping the game-balance/
economy issues get ironed out and the problem is alleviated
before stagnation truly overcomes us.  I also wish I had
the time and creativity to come up with some good solutions
within the current framework.  8)

The cost associated with making a Proposal and getting it distributed
is too high for Proposals that have a poor chance of being adopted.

In the short run, too.

Protoproposal Chaos63 [rev. 9]

Let the Promotor Exercise Judgment

Be it resolved, that Rule 1483 be amended to read:

      (a) A Proposal is any document clearly marked as such.

      (b) A Proposal is Proposed when it is posted by a Proposing
          Entity to the Public Forum with the clear indication that it
          is being posted for the purpose of Proposing it.

      (c) A Proposal is not Proposed if, in the Promotor's judgment,
          it is substantially identical to another Proposal Proposed
          within the past three weeks, unless
        (1) the Proposing Entity posting the Proposal clearly
            indicates at the time of posting that the Proposal is
            intended to become a duplicate of the prior Proposal, or
        (2) the prior Proposal has been discarded or withdrawn, or has
            been distributed and the results of voting upon that
            Proposal have been announced by the Assessor.

      (d) The Promotor's determination that a Proposal has or has not
          been Proposed (including a determination made under
          subdivision (c) of this Rule) is subject to judicial review
          only for abuse of discretion.

      (e) Under no circumstance shall the Promotor's distribution of
          previously undistributed Proposals constitute the submission
          of a new Proposal.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Any CFJ which alleges that an Officer made an error
          regarding a determination of fact where the Rules state that
          such determinations shall be subject to judicial review only
          for abuse of discretion lacks standing and shall be
          dismissed.  (Such CFJs, to have standing, must allege that
          the Officer in question abused discretion in making the
          disputed determination.)

      (b) This Rule takes precedence over all other Rules pertaining
          to when a CFJ has standing, and over all other Rules which
          specify when a CFJ shall be dismissed.

Protoproposal Chaos73 [rev. 4]

Standards of Proof

Be it resolved, that Rule 1575 be amended to read:

      (a) A CFJ alleging that a Player has violated a Rule or
          committed a Crime shall not be judged TRUE unless the
          evidence is sufficient to be certain of that Judgement
          beyond reasonable doubt.

      (b) In all other CFJs, the Judgement shall be consistent with
          the preponderance of the evidence at hand.

      (c) Furthermore, it is a complete defense to any accusation of a
          Crime that the Player accused, at the time e performed or
          neglected to perform the actions which constitute the Crime
          accused, reasonably believed that the circumstances were
          such that e was legally permitted to perform or neglect to
          perform those acts.  No Player shall be convicted of a Crime
          if this defense applies.

Actually I just realise that I misunderstood how the exemptions worked.
If you have a 50% taxes with a 5 VT cutoff level, then a player with 7 VTs
only gets taxed 1 VT, right?

If that's the case, then I have no objections to the proposal as it stands
at all.

Yes.  Doing it the other way (which is, I suppose, that the player
with 4.9 VTs pays nothing and the player with 7 VTs pays 3.5 VTs)
would be grossly unfair.

I'd agree with you, except that I don't even see any vaguely controversial
proposals even being discussed. So unless people are so convinced that 
they will never pass that they aren't even bothering to come up with ideas,
I'd say that the lack of proposals is more due to a lack of ideas, than
a fault with the system.

And to anyone who has an idea that needs funding, I will re-iterate my
offer to share the risk and pay part or all of the cost to get it 
distributed, in return for part or all of the reward for getting it 
passed (and no charge if it fails). I'll back anything that I judge to
be a fair risk. And I'm willing to take a gamble in the support of 
an innovative idea.
