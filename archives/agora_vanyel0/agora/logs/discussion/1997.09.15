I am not certain that I fully agree.  Take, for instance, the case
where an amendment shortens the Voting Period.  This might have the
effect of causing some Voting Periods in progress at the time of the
adoption of the amendment to end prior to the adoption of the
amendment.  This strikes me as a prohibited retroactive effect.

We are now following split strategies to fix this bug in the CFJ
system.

One is that of Scott's and my protos: leave the decision to the
judges, and authorize them to dismiss improperly made CFJs. This was
what Steve (I think it was you, wasn't it?) wanted to suggest right
from the start, but the wording of 1565, esp. point iv) proved to
restrictive. 

However I think most of us would agree that this strategy is what
rules like 1565 intend, and it is, if you will, the political will of
the majority.

Now this CFJ opens the possibility for a court decision to go against
this. Judging it TRUE would place the burdin of filtering out improper
CFJs on an officer, which is not really what we want.

I wonder what the decision will be like: more to the letter of the law
(TRUe, though that is not necessaryly the only proper judgement, as
Steve argued emself), or more in line with the political will of most
of us (FALSE). Hmm, let's see...

What I don't like about this Australian idea is that it punishes
intentional nonvotes. At the moment the situation is rather
symmetrical: you can, at no cost, give a proposal a little support by
being present; or you can give it a little opposition by not voting at
all. 

OTOH, there is an incentive to really vote, i.e. vote FOR or AGAINST
proosals, already implemented in the rules because only if you do that
you receive VTs according to 1684.

I think that most of the proposals that failed recentyl due to quorum
did so for some reason that needs no cure by something like the
Australian Elections: there were technical problems with the mailing
lists, some deliberate absences (at least from me), and the most
recent proposal that only received one vote was, IIRC, found to be
redundant after it was submitted. 

So I'd say. 't ain't broke, so why fix it?

You only receive 2/3 of the VT's you expended, no? So you are
losing net VT's anyway.

Well, that's the point: In order to avoid going bancrupt occasionally
you have to not vote, i.e. be present (which tends to support the
proposal in question) or not vote at all (which tends to oppose
it). Penalizing the latter would introduce a bias towards being
present, and would make it harder to oppose proposals by not voting at
all and hoping that they will fail quorum.

I suppose "submitting" is a better term.  "Making" a CFJ has been
construed as equivalent to "submitting" it; we have rarely placed much
concern on the details of authoring Game Documents, but seem to
consider them to have sprung into existence fully formed at the moment
they are first conveyed in a manner which gives them legal
significance.

Klaus> In any case I don't see how this would capture CFJs like 938,

How can a CFJ, wholly lacking in volition, violate a Rule?

Klaus> Also, what is the essential difference between what you want to

I believe it is meaningless to refer to a "CFJ which fails to comply
with the Rules", because CFJs are inanimate objects and thus unable to
comply, or fail to comply, with anything.  The closest reasonable
interpretation is "A CFJ which does not meet the requirements for
being a CFJ" but that is equivalent to "A CFJ which is not a CFJ" and
that is clearly vacuous (or equivocal, which is just as bad).

It asserts that anything sent to the Clerk of the Courts captioned as
a CFJ, is a CFJ.  It eliminates the ambiguity which we presently have
regarding CFJ 938.  With the above, CFJ 938 would unarguably be a CFJ.

It was buried within the Assessor's latest Voting Token Report, which e sent
out on Sunday.  E tends to report these Infractions towards the end of the
report, so you have to keep a sharp eye out.

Since you had one Indulgence in your possession at the time you sent this
message, I will take this delay to have been infinitessimal in length and have
marked POI084 as satisfied.

FYI, you still have two outstanding POs for Indulgences:

POI050  09/02/97 10:22:45 -0400     1     Andre        Bank         Herald
POI091  09/15/97 17:03:32 +0200     3     Andre        Bank         CotC

The first is still subject to Persistent Indebtedness, the other won't be until
after the next Report.  It would have been better to satisfy POI050 first, but
I don't think I can interpret the above message as allowing any real delay as
long as you had an Indulgence there which could satisfy it.  I double checked
my records and did not find any reference that I could interpret as a request
for a delayed TO on POI050.  Sorry.

At least now he has an excuse to read the Rules, and see if he finds
anything that looks even remotely familiar. :)

That's for sure... you know, I was going to wait a little while before 
re-registering, but I figured, with around 20 players I probably wouldn't 
have to do much in the first few days anyway. So I'm gonna dive in to 
this ruleset, but I can pretty much guarantee that it'll be a couple days 
before I make any judgements on these CFJ's...   :)   I readily invite 
discussion/argumentation on these by anyone with an opinion...

You know, it hasn't really changed THAT much in 2 years or so... heck, 
there's even several rules that I wrote still in there, mostly with some 
minor modifications. (i.e. the Theses section).

I was trying to remember what, if anything, of yours was still
around, and was thinking that Theses were your idea.

BTW, congrats on getting into Princeton.

To everyone and specifically to Crito:

This is not an official request, but could you please clarify CFJ for my 
benefit? I wasn't here when these infractions apparently occurred, and I 
don't know the history of this -- was this previously decided but 
invalidated by a recent CFJ? Please explain so I can get a handle on this 
and make a judgement. Thanks!

In my previous message asking for clarification I was referring to CFJ 
943 -- I accidentally left the number out. Thanks.

You have an important detail wrong: You don't get 2/3 of the VT's you
expended, you get VTs equal to 2/3 of the number of Proposals up for Vote.
(Maximum 8.) You only have to Vote on at least one of them.

Alas, lately there have been so few Proposals that this has meant 0 or 1
VTs. 

Greetings,
Ørjan.

Although I did argue that the Judge could go either way, I also argued
that I thought there were better reasons to Judge TRUE than FALSE, and
I hope the Judge will agree with me. If the Judge does judge FALSE, I
certainly hope it will be for better reasons than mere politics. A TRUE
Judgement might be temporarily inconvenient, but it will just show the
need to change the Rules to better reflect the will of the Players 
regarding how such CFJs should be handled.

Good luck. Michael tried this before, for quite a while. I don't think
he got much interest.

H. CotC Andre and ex-CotC Michael!

Whatever happened to CFJ 933? It went into a kind of limbo after 
it was assigned to Swann, and some relevant Rule got infected, 
right?. But the disinfection is long past, which means it should 
have been re-assigned ages ago, yes?

If you're referring to CFJ 942, the judge has submitted a judgement of 
FALSE, for reasons completely unrelated to politics. In fact I'm a little 
worried, because the reasons seem so simple to me, that I'm afraid that I 
must be wrong or someone would have noticed it by now. But I'm not one to 
submit my judgements for review before I send them to the CotC, so as 
soon as he sends it out you can evaluate it for yourself...

Well that part of the Ruleset hasn't changed, I'll grant you, but we've
had major reforms of the Judicial, Proposal and Currency Rules in the

Although this is somewhat debatable, Agora tends to take the stance
that the a Judgement merely expresses a pre-existing truth, rather
than actually changing anything.  This conceit holds even when a
Judgement is clearly writing new case law.  Case law arising from a
Judgement is generally applicable retroactive to the Judgement.

A statute of limitations would limit (or bar) retroactive application,
but we don't presently have any statutes of limitations.

And yet, the number of VTs in circulation continues slowly to climb,
most because of Salaries. It's time we did something about that. My
idea is to encourage spending of VTs by enshrining in legislation 
a kind of Restore Game Balance manoeuvre, to be performed, say,
every two months, perhaps only if certain conditions on VTs in
circulation are met. I'll write up a proto for comment.

The Assessor is not convinced that the Prescribed Voting Period of

of Proposal 3551's Prescribed Voting Period is, or when it commences;
given the lack of a legislative proscription, I am skeptical that
Proposal 3551 can be voted upon at all.

Well, yes, I really meant more the overall themes which are being debated 
and experimented with.. currencies, etc. The mechanics are different, but 
you've still been wresting with some of the same problems that we were

It's been at least three weeks since there's been a VT distribution;
we've consistently had either zero or one Proposal per week.  It takes
two before any payment occurs.

Well, a good deal of the Rule Change provisions are the same, at
least (although not nearly all of them!).

I think you can probably shorten this to simply "A Plot may not own 
more than one Mule."

Well, exactly. I mean, he could credit each of us with the part we wrote, but other than my 
"Proximity" Rule, most of them are sort of hard to define. Maybe the authors should hold a little 
meeting and decide how to divvy up the credit. :)

That's clear as mud. Let me try: "Why would failing to ratify the
Wizard's Report of September 4th cause uncertainty in the game
state?"

As a suggestion, you might wish to mention which proposals you will be 
using this restriction on immediately after the proposals are distributed, and prevent anyone 
from making an offer within the first three days of a Proposal's voting period.

I didn't think so. Currently, our Currencies are transferred the same way, and it seems to work 
out just fine. Since there are no real "negatives" to owning a Plot (upkeep can just not be paid, 
if you don't want it) there is no real reason to "protect" people from such transfers. If someone 
doesn't want the Plot, e can simply give it back.

Here's a synopsis of the problem.  Prior to the Pragmatic Currencies proposal
(which set up Payment Orders and Transfer Orders for exchanging Currencies),
penalties that included Blots were simple.  A player gained Blots if e commited
a Crime or Infraction - it was not a Currency.  Reporting was simple, the
reporter simply stated that the Player gained x number of Blots.  However,
after the PC proposal passed, Blots were redefined to be equivalent to Payment
Orders for Indulgences.  I quote from R1435 below:

      A Payment Order for 1 Indulgence, the payee of which is the
      Bank, is called a Blot.  When a Rule states that a Player is to
      gain some number of Blots, a Payment Order shall be executed
      with that Player as the payor, the Bank as the payee, and for a
      number of Indulgences equal to the number of Blots that Player
      is to receive.  This order is to be executed by whomever is
      required to report the change in Blots.

Old habits die hard, and the CotC at that time reported three Infractions of
Failing to Judge shortly after the passage of PC, by stating, for each of these
Infractions, that Player x gains 3 Blots.  E did not state that Player x is
ordered to pay 3 Indulgences to the Bank.  At the time, I chose to interpret
the first sentence of the paragraph quoted above as reflexive wrt messages that
specified Blots - 1 Blot = a PO for 1 Indulgence, 3 Blots = a PO for 3
Indulgences - as a courtesy to those getting used to the new Rules.  The recent
ruling on CFJ940 however, seems to prohibit this interpretation, since the
reports did not contain the words "Payment Order" or had any explicit command
to pay Indulgences to the Bank.

So CFJ943 will finalize the answer to these questions.  Does 940 truly prohibit
this interpretation? (I suspect yes, but I'm not really sure.)  But also, does
the verdict of CFJ940 apply to the decisions I made prior to the issuance of
the CFJ? (Game custom seems to indicate that this is so, as Scott has pointed
out.)

Hope this helps.

Well, I'll have to think some more about that. But if that's right,
it's kind of a shame in a way that when I rewrote the Virus, I didn't
make the period of infection 3 weeks rather than 2. If I had, then
the infection of R693 would have delivered us our first activation
of R1698 (The Proposal System is Protected), which would have been
a nice result.

Actually, that's not right, because of Guillotine and Emergency
Proposals. Even with a 3 week infection period, it would still
be possible to get a Proposal adopted in the remaining week using
either of those mechanisms.

It wouldn't cause uncertainty. It would remove what uncertainty there 
is. Said uncertainty being just the normal possibility of 
recordkeeping errors which creep in over time but can be a *major* 
pain if discovered late. In fact, I consider it A Good Thing to 
ratify all ratifiable reports every couple of months.
