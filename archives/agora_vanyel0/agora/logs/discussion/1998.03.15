Rule 1483 makes clear that a Proposal is as proposed.

I tend to agree that 107 prevents the proposed form from taking
effect.  I would suggest (though I am willing to be argued out
of) that Proposal 3710 has not yet been distributed.

The reason that politics is an inevitable and central part of Agora
is that logical grounds alone are simply insufficient for making most
decisions about the Ruleset. Consider just one among numberless
examples: the repeal of the Virus. It would be naive to think that
rigorously logical arguments could have been given either for repealing
this Rule or for retaining it. Certainly *arguments* were given, but
these arguments appealed to different visions that different Players had
of what the game should be like. These different visions are not
differentiable on logical grounds, and are in fact likely to amount
simply to differences in matters of taste. The process of determining
which among such competing visions of the game will hold sway at some
particular time is essentially a political one,

Well put.  Logic may tell us how best to achieve our goals, but
it cannot tell us what our goals should be.

The exact text of R107 is interesting in this regard:

      Any proposed Rule Change must be written down (or otherwise
      communicated in print media) before it is voted on. If adopted,
      it must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.

Note the archaism 'proposed Rule Change'. Nowadays, we would simply
say 'Proposal', and if the Rule had that wording, we might be tempted
to conlude that nothing happens (unless scrivener's error were allowed
for). But the Rule says 'proposed Rule Change'. P3710 contains a number
of proposed Rule Changes, all of which with one exception were 
distributed accurately by Blob. All these proposed Rule Changes, it seems
to me, have been voted upon, and adopted, and must therefore guide play
in the form in which they were adopted.

[The following remarks assume that P3710 has been adopted and taken
effect.]

Nevertheless, I think you will need to explain to me why you think
this will work. The Power 3 R955 sets Voting Indices. The Rule created
by this Proposal will therefore have to take precedence over R955, if
it is to have the effect you desire of making the VI of CVSII equal
to 6 regardless of the votes cast on it. As far as the text of this
Proposal is concerned, there is nothing it which which will make this
Proposal an instrument of Power greater than 1. As it stands, then,
it cannot create a ule which will take precedence over R955. I can
only conclude, therefore, that CVSII contains provisions which you
think will have the effect of raising the Power if CVSI to at least
3. But what could such provisions be? You cannot exploit the
instrument loophole to raise the Power of a Rule to 3 with a Proposal
of AI 1, since that loophole has now been closed. Therefore, to
have the effect you desire, CVSII will have to have an AI of at
least 3, which will certainly make it difficult to pass.

I think it's way too early to be claiming that P3710 has not taken
effect. There's been an Assessor's Report of the results, so far
unchallenged, so I think the legal presumption has got to be that
the Proposal has taken effect until we a get a Court ruling to the
contrary.

Nevertheless, I won't COE on this, although it's tempting to do so,
since the matter is destined to end up in the Courts anyway.

My view is that the combined effects of R1483 and R107 are that the
provisions of the Proposal which were accurately distributed by Blob
have been voted on, adopted and taken effect and that only the fate
of the mangled provision remains unclear. I would argue that the
provision in R107 which requires that proposed Rule Changes must be
'communicated in print media...before being voted on' should be taken
to mean that proposed Rule Changes must be distributed to all Players
before being voted on. The correct text of the now mangled provision
has not been distributed to all Players and has not been voted upon.
Arguably, therefore, it cannot take effect. The other provisions have
been distributed, however, and so their effectiveness should not be
in dispute. That, at any rate, is how I see the situation.
