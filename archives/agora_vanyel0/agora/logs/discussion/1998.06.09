Sheesh, this is pretty slack, people.

OK. I offer 3 VTs to the first 2 Players who vote for both of P3756
and P3757.

You seem to have forgotten that unemployment
benefits are expressed in terms of the BOS: they are half the BOS
to be precise. So Officers will always have a relative VT-income
advantage with respect to the unemployed, which is probably as it
should be.

Secondly, I think we should regard the necessity of halving the BOS
as an indication that Officers are currently overpaid.

I completely agree, and would like to join Steve in his appeal to the
chancellor to lower the BOS. 

I would also like to point out, that this will reduce the unemployment
benefit to not much more than a gesture, though, so I believe it is
very important to get plots running soon. 

It is nice to observe that VT scarcity is beginning to make a real
difference. However, in the case that P3756 and 3757 are adopted, I
believe we will have so much trouble meking proposals pass that I
would also like to ask the promotor to reduce the proposal batch size
to 2 again.

Thankyou. Regrettably, you were some hours too late to take advantage

That's one possible recourse, it's true. But I doubt it will make that
much of a difference. What will really be needed is an appreciation
on the part of those Players who want their Proposals to pass that they
can no longer expect other Players simply to vote for their Proposals
as a matter of course. Some distribution of largesse, such as that
offerred by myself for Proposals 3756 and 3757 (on which I have now
spent 8 VTs), will increasingly be required, be it in the form of VTs
other Currencies, or the less tangible medium of promises and
favours. This should have the effect of distributing wealth from the
haves to the have-nots.

This should be interesting. VTs entering the economy per week due to
Salaries will be slashed to less than 10 by this measure, which will
at the very least stabilize the number of VTs in circulation per
Player. We may even see a slow decline, which will make Proposals
more and more difficult to pass as time goes on. This should lead to
interesting political pressures just around the time new Elections
for Chancellor will have to be held.

It seems to me that the two messages you need were included by
Macross in his Evidence.

Blob's suggestions
==================
reorganized and adapted to the current situation by Kolja A., whose
remarks are in square brackets [] while Blob's are in curly brackets
{}. Changes from Blob's version are marked by a side bar.

I think that the bug fixes in I. are necessary and uncontroversial. If
Blob doesn't do so soon (what are your plans, Blob?), I will propose
them (my version for the second one).

The changes in II and III don't seem to be urgent to me. I've added my
comments for whoever wants to push these changes. Blob?

I have completely omitted some points, too, mostly those already
implemented in current proposals.


I. Bug Fixes
============


I.1. Structure limit
====================

[This is an obvious bug fix.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 1845 ("Structures") to read:

      There exists a class of entities known as Structures.  
|
|      Each Structure is assigned to a Plot and owned by that Plot's
|      owner. No Plot may be assigned more than one Structure.
|
      No entity may own more than five Structures, unless another Rule
      specifies otherwise.

----------------------------------------------------------------------


I.2. Payment timing
===================

There is an obvious vagueness in the rules that describe the timing of
the production payments, and the billing of maintenance fees. The main
problem lies in R1850's provision that 

      As soon as possible after the end of the Nomic Week, the
      Cartographor shall pay out each Structure's Production to its
      owner, excluding Structures whose Type changed during that Week,
      and excluding Players with a Maintenance Fee that is neither
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      satisfied, disputed, nor vacated.
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

So, if the Cartographor posts the Maintenance Fee POs before the
Structure Production POs, one may argue that e cannot pay out the
latter, at all.

Clearly this is against the spirit of the rule, and I would frown on
(and probably deKudo) any Cartographor who did this, but it should be
fixed nevertheless.

Blob suggested the following fix:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 1849 ("Maintenance of Structures") to read:

      A Player's Maintenance Fee equals the total of the Maintenance
      Fees of all the Structures e owns, plus 1 Erg per Type of
      Structure e owns, at the end of the Nomic Week.

      As soon as possible after having made all Production payments
      for a given week, the Cartographor shall bill each Player's 
      Maintenance Fee to that Player.

{Comments: Maintenance has to be billed _after_ Production is paid.}

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I think it would be better to limit the problematic restriction in
1850 to overdue Maintenance Fee POs, as we already do for PI blots
(R1713) and Debt Voting (R1824). Say,

______________________________________________________________________
Amend 1850 to read:

      As soon as possible after the end of the Nomic Week, the
      Cartographor shall pay out each Structure's Production to its
      owner, excluding Structures whose Type changed during that Week,
      and excluding Players named as Payor of at least one Overdue
      Payment Order which was executed originally for the purpose of
      collecting Maintenance Fees from that Player.
______________________________________________________________________



II. Plot Economy
================

II.1. Cosmetics
===============

[The following is a small step towards pragmatization, but does not
seem urgent to me. Why are there no more free Plots here? Probably
Blob forgot to remove the 2nd sentence of the 1st paragraph. Replacing
the price with ergs and the bank with the crown appears rather
cosmetic to me.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 1843 ("Buying and Selling Plots") to read:

      The Market Value of a Plot is 5 Ergs, unless the Rules state
      otherwise.  In particular, the Market Value of the first three
      Crown-owned Plots purchased by a given Player is 0 VTs.

      A Player may become the owner of a Crown-owned Plot by
      transferring the Market Value of that Plot to the Bank for the
      sole purpose of buying that Plot.

      A Plot's owner may transfer ownership of it to any other
      consenting entity, by informing the Cartographor that e wishes
      to do so.  For the purposes of this Rule, the Crown is always
      deemed to consent to such wishes.  Furthermore, as soon as
      possible after a Plot is transferred to the Crown in this way,
      the Cartographor shall pay out half the Plot's Market Value to
      the transferring entity.

{Comments: No free Plots. Plot prices are in Ergs, because I feel that
 is a more appropriate medium.}

{Note: Transfers need to be Pragmatised. Transfers from the Crown must
 only be when the rules require them.}

----------------------------------------------------------------------



II.2. Variable Maintenance fees
===============================

[I have added a limitation to the changes allowed by the new rule "The
Cartographor can set Maintenance Fees." to give entrepreneurs some
possibility to plan ahead, and to disallow the Cartographor from
ruining people by suddenly raising the MF strongly.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------

| Amend Rule 1846 ("Ergs") to read:

      Ergs are a Currency.  Their MUQ is 0.1.  Their Recordkeepor is
      the Cartographor.  Their Mintor is the Bank.

{Comment: Changed the MUQ to 0.1, in order to allow more flexibility
 in setting the Maintenance Fee.}

{Note: Check on new-player erg values. Should be enough to buy 1 Plot
 and 1 Structure, perhaps with a little left over for the first few
 week's Maintenance.}

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Create a rule entitled "The Cartographor can set Maintenance Fees."
with text:

      The Cartographor can set the value of the Maintenance Fee for
      Structures by announcing in the Public Forum that e is doing so, 
      provided that e announces a value between 0 Ergs and 2 Ergs
      inclusive, that e makes the announcement before midnight GMT 
|      Thursday, that the Maintenance Fee has not already been set
|      by a similar such announcement earlier in the Week, and that
|      the new Maintenance Fee differs from the old one by not more
|      than 0.5 Ergs.

{Comment: Same mechanism as the Chancellor's control over the BOS.
 This should allow the Cartographor some leverage over the Plots side
 of the economy.}

----------------------------------------------------------------------


II.3. Farm production
=====================

I'm not sure the production of farms should be reduced. With the
current rules, hardly anyone can produce more than 2 or 3 VTs per
week, which is comparable to the income of several officers.

If we change this at all, why not make the production of one farm
equal to one BOS? Then having a few farms is equivalent to holding one
or two offices.

BTW, the same logic would suggest lowering the production of Houses,
too. 


III. Bits and pieces
====================

III. 1. The crown
=================

[taken from Blob's Proto unchanged]

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Create a Rule entitled "The Crown" with the text:

      There shall exist a Nomic Entity called the Crown. 
      The Cartographor is the Executor of the Crown.

{Comments: The Crown is the Bank-equivalent for Plots. The important
 difference is that the Crown is under the control of the Cartographor,
 not the Chancellor. Rules below are amended appropriately.}

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Create a Rule entitled "Plots" with the text:

      There is a class of entities called Plots.  

      New Plots are created when the Cartographor posts to the Public
      Forum that e is creating new Plots, specifying the number that 
      e is creating.  The newly created Plots are in the possession of
      the Crown. 

      Plots are destroyed when any entity which possesses them 
      transmits to the Cartographor a notice that e is destroying them,
      specifying the number of Plots that e is destroying.  An entity
      cannot destroy more Plots than e possesses, however.  The units 
      destroyed are removed from the possession of the entity 
      performing the destruction.

      When a Plot is created, its creator shall give it a unique name.  
      A Plot's owner may change its name Without Objection, provided 
      that the new name is unique.

{Comments: Plots are created and destroyed pragmatically. The Cartographor
 is free to name new Plots as e sees fit - all formal notions of Adjacency
 are omitted.}

----------------------------------------------------------------------

[This seems unnecessary to me now; the creation and naming of Plots
has been fixed with P3753.]


III. 2. The Cartographor
========================

[This was also fixed by P3753.]


III. 3. Separation of powers
============================

[Modified to avoid confusion when both offices are held temporarily,
say, by the speaker because noone else is currently office holder.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Create a Rule entitled "Separation of Powers" with the text:

|      If at any time a Player holds the offices of Chancellor and 
|      Cartographor in the Normal Fashion, then e must resign from one 
|      of these Offices as soon as possible.

{Comments: The Cartographor will have economic leverage, like the 
 Chancellor. This Rule is designed to keep too much power from settling
 in one pair of hands.}

----------------------------------------------------------------------


III.4 Win by monopoly
=====================

[This just replaces bank with crown. If you don't want to win this
way, just give one plot away. Why should this ever happen, anyway,
barring loophole abuse? I guess this is another white
elephant... let's kill him.]

This is exactly the sort of "conditional move" that I want to see

This is exactly the sort of "conditional move" that I want to see
banned.  You either vote, or you do not vote.  Don't force Officers to
evaluate complicated conditions to determine if you have or have not
voted.
<<

I fully agree. The same applies to CFJ1097 - not that I mind judging
it, but I think it isn't good style to do things that way. If you only
want to perform an act under certain conditions, research whether
these conditions are met, and take a risk. But don't leave the tiring
paper work to officers and/or judges.

The more difficult question is, how can we implement a ban on such
conditional actions? I think a concerted action of some players who
punish conditional actions with Kudo transfers might be a simpler way
to discourage this behavior.

There should have been a couple of these ":)" in that message, sorry.

Actually, I can understand some of your problems with conditionals, but
I think it's a matter of degree.  I certianly think that there is a
qualitative difference between my conditional-- which was simply
predicated on an easily determinable timing issue.  (I didn't know if
any messages had made it to the lists before or just as I was sending
it.)  It cerianly wasn't the same kind of conditional as Macross' Order
message, which was based on a contriversial legal issue.

I think you're right in that Officers shouldn't be forced into
unreasonable ascertations of fact.  But the contitional you're talking
about is one that would be patently obvious once it made its way through
the server.

As far as banning such messages goes, I think you'd lose more than you'd
gain.  I think you'd place some players into uncomfortable situations
where they could possibly be forced into doingsomething illegal-- I am
thinking especially of TIA disclaimers in the case of a severe gamestate
split, which are conditional as well.

Also, the talk of "banning" such a move sounds overtly platonic, doesn't
it?  How can you ban a player's move in this incresingly pragmatic
ruleset?

Exactly.

"I vote for Bill Clinton, unless Bob Dole has deposited $50 or more in
my bank account within the last twenty days."  Do you think that a
poll worker is going to accept that vote?  If it was an Agoran
election, the Votekeepor would seemingly be required to, something
that I find mindnumbingly ridiculous.

Game state splits are caused in part by conditional messages!  Also,
one of the goals of the "increasingly pragmatic ruleset" you mention
below is to reduce game state splits.  (It should be noted that I find
the notion of "game state splits" abhorrent.)

As far as the risk of accidentially violating the Rules: tough!  You
pay your money, you take your chances.  If you don't want the risk,
DON'T DO IT.

Replace "ban" with "prevent from having legal effect", then.  What is
it with this aversion to plain meaning, anyway?

I've been keeping quiet and trying to keep an open mind about this VT economy,
but this is what I fear might happen.

1.  The game will begin to stagnate as it becomes more difficult to get
    proposals passed.

2.  The focus of the game will shift away from the interplay of changing
    Rules and their interpretations to monopoly-like manipulations of
    entities - something I would regret to see.  (Although I am hopeful
    that both foci might be able to exist simultaneously).

3.  Distribution of wealth will not go from haves to have-nots but will
    circulate among a relatively fixed, quorum-sized group of Players/Officers,
    marginalizing other Players even more than they already are.

Hope I'm wrong.

Just out of curiosity, why didn't you mention this at the time you
applied the (null) Rule Change to 833, which was about one month
ago ? Also, shouldn't the FLR list a null amendment in 833's History ?

Another option is to have the determination of the relevant Officer
be binding.  That is, if Player X says, "If condition A, then I do T."
If the officer determines that A is true, then X has done T, even if
it is later determined that A was false.

Of course, this presents problems defining the relevant officer.

There were several attempted changes that failed in those three
batches that I applied all at once.  It's not my duty to list
attempted changes which failed.  (I might consider doing that
as a service to the Agoran public, if there is demand for it,
except not at my current salary of 0.8 VTs.)

As for the null amendment, I discussed a few months ago why
I now believe that no null amendments have been applied since
R594 took its current form: "Provisions which are unclear, ambiguous,
or inapplicable are ignored."  Thus, the provision in the
proposal is inapplicable, and results in no amendment rather
than a null amendment.

Well, if in Order to stop Swann I am forced to use some of the weapons
available to me I will definitely need to stay of the CotC good side as it
could likely entail quite a bit of work for em. :)

I was not so much concerned with when action will be taken on the CFJ but if
action would be taken.  Michael has said he is working on it and as long as
Swann is relatively inactive in our little Order war I am content to wait.

I hate to admit this but I'm not even aware of what proposals are up for
vote!  Beyond the Coup I haven't been following things too closely.  If
anyone would like to inform me of the virtues (or vices) of a proposal, I
would be happy to consider voting.

As a general policy, I will not vote (or declare presence) on any
proposal unless someone writes me a personal message which explains to
my satisfaction why I should vote on that proposal.

If you are right, I think it will be only in the short term. As we've
seen many times before, any tendency the game has to stagnate quickly
produces a countertendency on the part of Player to do something about
it. Equally, any tendency for power to concentrate in the hands of a
small group of Officers should produce a countertendency at the next
set of Elections.

[Note: No Orders are issued in the following text.]

If it please the Court, I would retract the argument I made that the Order
directed to me by Swann is invalid as amended.  I no longer think this is
the case.  The reason for this change is that I have come to believe that
Swann's  Order is not in fact directed to me at all.  As such I was not
enjoined by any Order at the time I posted the message which created the
Palindrome Order.

Why do I believe this?  The issue goes right to the heart of what an Order
is and what an amendment to an Order can achieve.

Rule 1793/0 (Orders) defines an Order using this language:

      An Order is a command, executed by a Player and directed to some
      entity....

>From this it can be clearly seen that to be an Order, something must first
and foremost be a command.  Further this command must be executed by a
Player and this command must be directed to some entity.  In other words an
Order is a command which just happens to exist in the proper context.

It is my opinion that careful study of this definition will lead one to the
conclusion, perhaps startling to some, that an amendment should not be
allowed to alter the entity to which the Order is directed.  In particular
one should note that while the Order consists of the command, it does not
consist of the entity to whom it is directed.  The fact of it's being
directed to an entity is just a circumstance of it's existence.  How then
can one amend the Order to alter to whom it is directed?  One might just
well assume that one could amend the Order to alter the Player who executed
it.

Thus, if we would not allow:

      I hereby command Swann to pay 50 Indulgences to the bank.

      I hereby amend the previous Order to "General Chaos hereby
      commands Swann to pay 50 Indulgences to the bank."

we must not allow:

      I hereby command Swann to pay 50 Indulgences to the bank.

      I hereby amend the previous Order to "I hereby command
      General Chaos to pay 50 Indulgences to the bank."

An Order is a command.  That command has related entities, an executor and a
directee.  If we allow one to be changed, why not the other?  The reality is
that neither can be changed by an amendment to the command; they are fixed
at the moment the command is issued.

Further, I would ask that you consider this:  An Order is not the text which
created it.  Nowhere do the Rules imply this to be the case.  Simply
altering what the text says cannot change the directee or the executor.
Amending an Order to "This is not an Order." produces an Order invalid only
because it is no longer a command and not due to lack of Executor or
Directee.  In fact, due to presumption of validity, it's still an Order that
must be obeyed by the directee (though how that can be done is beyond me)
unless found invalid by CFJ!

If nothing else convinces you, imagine I privately sent you a message that
said simply "This is an Order: Transfer me 5 VT's".  Note that no directee
is named.  The directee is known by implication because I sent it to you
privately.  Most Orders only mention the directee because, in a post to the
public forum, it would be ambiguous to do otherwise.  This shows that the
directee is not a part of the Order, not a part of the command, not even
necessarily a part of the text that created the Order.  It is really just a
part of the context of the command.

In conclusion, since the Order in question cannot possibly affect me, and
since a recent CFJ has ruled that Orders such as the Palindrome Order are
valid, I think you must conclude that I did in fact issue the Palindrome
Order.

I completely agree with regard to CFJ1097.  I have come in the time since I
posted the Palindrome Order message to think of it as quite cowardly.  I
felt at the time that the move was legal but didn't want to risk that I
might be wrong.

I hereby transfer 1 Kudo from myself for cowardice to Kolja A. for calling
things as he sees 'em and for not minding judging a CFJ that should never
have been necessary.
