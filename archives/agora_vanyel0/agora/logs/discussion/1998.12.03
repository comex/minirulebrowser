Protoproposal Chaos71 [rev. 3]

Make the Proposal Queue More Competitive  

Be it therefore resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) The Proposal Tariff is a number of P-Notes (which must be a
          multiple of the MUQ for P-Notes), greater than 0 and not
          more than 2.

      (b) The value of the Proposal Tariff, upon the adoption of the
          Proposal which created this Rule, is 1.

      (c) The Promotor may change the value of the Proposal Tariff by
          announcing its new value in the Public Forum, provided that
          the new value is within the range allowed by subdivision (a)
          of this Rule.

      (d) Whenever a new value is announced according to subdivision
          (c) of this Rule, the new value takes effect at the
          beginning of the next Nomic Week, unless the announcement is
          made within three days of the end of the current Nomic Week,
          in which case the new value takes effect at the beginning of
          the Nomic Week following the next Nomic Week.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1771 be amended to read:

      A Player may increase or decrease the Priority of a Proposal in
      the Queue by announcing to the Public Forum that e does so, and
      paying a number of P-Notes to the Bank. For each multiple of the
      Proposal Tariff e pays to the Bank, the Priority of the Proposal
      is increased or decreased by one, as specified by the Player
      making the payment, provided that this transfer is not executed
      for any other purpose.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1701 be amended, by replacing "is 1"
with "is 0.01".

There already exists an Infraction called 'Dereliction of Duty', namely
not posting an obligatory weekly report for a period of 3 weeks or more.

Well, actually, though I used a theorem-prover as the underlying tool
to do much of the work, there's not that much about that side of
things in the thesis itself.

Good question!  I've been nomicking longer than I've been PhDing after

I think this sounds like fun. And like fun on the very elementary
nomic level - with no (or hardly no) new bookkeeping, officers' work
or other red tape involved. 

The only minor problem that might arise is that with a larger number
of rejected proposals P-notes might become very scarce. But I think
that would be a good thing, if it doesn't completely choke proposing.

Splitting VTs into two types sounds like a nightmare in comparison to
this simple proposal - I hope noone is seriously considering this? We
can't even cope with the present VT economy paperwork.

But who would be willing to pay the P-Notes for TPs?

That's true. But who's going to waste eir P-notes to get these
distributed? This proposal has lots of potential, I believe.

It would go like this :

I propose "Prop 1 : The Voting Period is ten years.".
I propose "Prop 2 : Morendil is awarded 10 P-Notes and 20 VTs.".

This is ideal with a Batch size of two, of course; but at worst you
can send up two Terrible Proposals and one not-so-terrible.

I vote FOR Prop 1. My minimum cost is two P-Notes to get the two 
Proposals distributed. My voting cost is one VT. Now, with A Duty to 
Vote, one has the choice between Voting AGAINST 1, or FOR 2. Each 
isolated Vote costs 1 VT. Voting AGAINST both costs 2 VTs. (Not 
Voting at all, of course, only costs 1 VT). The only cost-free choice
is to vote FOR 2 and AGAINST 1. Economics dictate this will be the 
most frequent choice in the poorest portion of the population.

In addition, with A Duty to Propose, one would be tempted to give it
a try, just to get rid of the obligation...

Yes, that is one way how making and paying P-notes for terribe
proposals can work. But I think this is not a bad thing - if you can
pull it off, you deserve the reward. OTOH, there is plenty of scope
for tampering with these proposals' priorities, for the Promotor to
tamper with the timing of the distribution, for voters to get
organized to stop you, and so forth. At the moment, I believe this
would allow a lot of fun on a very elementary nomicking level -
something we seem to be missing a bit at the moment.

Yup. This isn't to say I don't like elJefe's suggestion (I don't, in
fact, like it all that much, but it's more because I would hate to
have to start counting my FORs and AGAINSTs - I am bothered enough
by mandatory Voting and Proposing as it is), just that this kind of
Scam looks like an almost natural consequence. But as you say, that's
for the merrier.

'Dereliction of Duty' is already in use. See R1644.

We'd want to be a bit careful about this. Despite elJefe's recent
experiences, an examination of the complete voting record will reveal
that many more FOR votes are cast than AGAINST votes. This is only
natural: most ideas that people would vote against never get proposed.

The fact that Proposals are submitted publically is not a good argument
for splitting the task of keeping track of who has proposed off into
another Office. For the truth is that only the Promotor, of all Players,
is already required to keep track of when all Proposals are submitted,
for the purposes of maintaining the Queue. Giving the job of keeping
track of Public Service Statuses to another Officer would therefore
certainly be a duplication of work.
