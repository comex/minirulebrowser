Given our VT-scarce environment and the fact that we can only distribute
three (at the moment) proposals, while the Repeal-O-Matic spits out one
every week, I would suggest that we make one of several possible changes:

1) Reduce the frequency of ROM proposals to, say, twice or even once a month.
2) Instead of a proposal, have a special ROM referendum for each proposed
repeal. This way, more of the ROM repeals are likely to get passed (if that
is indeed what we desire...)
