First, Sorites paradoxes, also known as paradoxes of the heap, or
paradoxes of vagueness. They all have more or less the same form,
involving the use of a vague predicate, like 'heap', or 'red', or
'young'. Eg:

P1. Zero grains of sand are not a heap.
P2. You can never turn anything that is not a heap into a heap, by
    adding a single grain of sand to it.
C.  (by induction) Ten thousand grains of sand are not a heap.

The argument's valid. Most interest focusses on P2. The problem with
denying it is that denying it implies, or at least seems to imply, that
there is some number of grains of sand, N, such that N grains of
sand are not a heap, but N+1 grains of sand are a heap. And this seems
at least as absurd as the conclusion that 10,000 grains of sand are
not a heap.

Now, in the present case, you seem to be denying that we really have
a Sorites paradox, since you are claiming that we have no reason to
think that long dead people cannot own Currencies. I've just posted
my defence of my rejection of that view in another post, so I won't
repeat it here.

No Passing the Buck

Be it therefore resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      A Recordkeepor may refuse to record a Transfer Order or Payment
      Order, the amount of which is not specified as a fixed numeral.
      If a Recordkeepor agrees to record a Transfer Order or Payment
      Order which is not specified as a fixed numeral, the value which
      the Recordkeepor determines to be correct at the time e records
      that Transfer Order or Payment Order is the amount of that
      Order, even if the Recordkeepor's determination is erroneous.

[This is to prevent Players from stating that they "execute whatever
 Payment Orders they are required to execute" or "transfer all but two
 VTs to some entity", thereby transferring the responsibility to
 determine what they are legally required to do to Recordkeepors,
 and/or creating uncertainty in Currency Records by specifying
 contingent transfer amounts.]

I believe I've now replied to this objection. My view is not that
"it's commonsense because it's commonsense". There is some substantial
content to my view about what commonsense amounts to in trying to
understand the concept of 'possession' in Agora.

But surely that is the nature of true common sense. Doesn't common sense
comprise those things that are plainly evident, and need not be defended?

Deceased persons are clearly incapable of possessing anything in a
natural sense, and there is no justifiable legal purpose or benefit in
allowing deceased persons to continue to have attributed possession of
objects past a time sufficient to dispose of those possessions in an
orderly fashion.

Agora's Rules are thoroughly silent on who or what has the capacity to
possess objects.  In my opinion, Rule 116 does not apply; this is not
a case of permission, but one of capacity.  The Rules, by default, are
silent on capacity, and so Rule 217's external standards come into
play.  

Game Custom marginally disfavors allowing arbitrary objects from
possessing Currencies, but not strongly.  I have already detailed my
opinion as to what common sense entails in this situation.  I am not
aware of any definitive past Judgements.  And, finally, I feel that it
is marginally in the best interest of the game that long-dead Greek
philosophers be denied the capacity to possess Currencies, as allowing
it permits (and even encourages) Players to impose extra tedium on
Recordkeepors (and now, due to the Stranded Currency Rule, the
Chancellor) by making pointless and inane transfers of Currency to all
sorts of phantasmagoric entities.

I didn't *defend* my commonsense view; I only explained what its

Common sense is common sense because it's common sense.  That's what
makes it common sense.

Something is common sense if, after you state it, someone asks you
"why?" and your first response is to exclaim in exasperation,
"Because!"  There can be a rational explanation for it too, but what
characterizes common sense is the idea that it's so obvious as to not
need one.

In my opinion, it is patently obvious that Plato has long since lost
the capacity to possess anything.  The idea of attributing possession
of anything to him is preposterous, and should not be seriously
entertained by any reasonable person.  

A rational discussion can be had, but it'll get bogged down into a
bunch of complex legal and philosophical discourses on what is
property; how real (fixed), personal (moveable), and intangible
property differ from each other; what constitutes ownership or
possession (both actual and attributed); whether a right to property
exists, and if so, what the limitations upon that right are; and a
myriad other issues.  Many of these questions end up revolving around
ideological beliefs (I can make a good argument from Locke for the
extinguishment of the right of property at death, but that assumes
that you accept Locke's ideology).

All that notwithstanding, I doubt you will find many people, of any
ideological bent or customary background, who willingly would assert
that a man dead 2000 years might possibly own property.

Anyone want to try to set up such a thing?  Perhaps draw players from the
various members of Internomic, and/or from the various Imperial Nomics.

I realized that some time after sending out the AWJ.  I suppose I'll

I believe this is one of the arguments for fuzzy logic (which, omitting
lots of details, replaces binary truth values - 1 or 0 - with continuous
truth values - e.g. "this apple is all red, or mostly red, or half red,
or slightly red, or not at all red"):

P1. Zero grains of sand are not-at-all a heap.
P2. You can never turn anything that is not-at-all a heap into
    totally-a-heap, by adding a single grain of sand to it.  However,
    you can turn something that is a heap to degree X into something
    that is a heap to degree (Y>X), by adding a single grain of sand
    to it.  The fuzziness is sufficiently gradual that it takes more
    than one grain to traverse the majority of the heapness spectrum.
C.  (by induction) Ten thousand grains of sand are likely to be at
    least mostly-a-heap.

ROM I passed, but apparently didn't create a Rule because it didn't claim

For myself, when thinking about Currencies, I keep
it always before me that Nomic originated as a face to face game, and
that it is useful to think about Currencies in terms of how such
things are treated in face to face games such as Poker and Monopoly.
This is what I mean by 'commonsense'. Now, a Monopoly note cannot
possess another Monopoly note, so I don't think a VT can possess
another VT.
<<

I also find the board game concept helpful for such questions. And for
the above points I agree with Steve.

>>

However, I cannot get this result simply from the board game
analogy. Really, if you want to mentally construct what our current
game of Agora would be like as a board game, it would not involve
passing physical currency tokens around from one player to
another. That's the whole point of the PC paradigm.

Physical tokens or not, all that is passed around are POs and TOs, and
the recordkeepor of a currency is the only one to ever execute TOs. 
E can use physical tokens and move them from the area assigned to one
player to the area assigned to another player, or e may get rid of the
tokens and just use written "bank accounts" to note transfers and
currency holdings. So why should e not be able to start a new account
in eir book of accounts for Plato (or designate a new area of the
gaming table as the area holding Plato's currency possessions)?

Agora is not a representative democracy to begin with, but a
participatory democracy. So your points about Quorum in
representative democracies are probably not applicable here.
<<

But isn't that another argument in favor of a high quorum? Yes, Agora
is based on participation. The rules for (de)registering and the
possibility to go on and off hold all are made with the goal that
"active" players are just that: actively participating, voting etc. 

And a high quorum is an incentive to take this concept of "active"
participation seriously and try to encourage inactive players to at
least go on hold. In fact, our rules for deregistration of
silent/abandoning players are also connected with this concept of
active participation. And we started working on them again, and
announcing absence of some inactive players, when some proposals began
to fail quorum because of their inactivity. If there were no quorum,
inactive players wouldn't be a problem.

But participation need not take the form of Voting.  And, since we
have elected to make Voting relatively expensive, it stands to reason
that Players will frequently choose to not Vote, and by so doing, they
are participating.  It is unfortunate, in a way, that electing to not
Vote is indistinguishable in effect from failing to Vote.

I had a feeling Steve was going to trot out the Monopoly analogy again, and I
am ready for it.  Suppose we are playing face to face with poker chips around a
table, with a board, just like Monopoly.  What's to prevent the rules of the
game from designating a particular square on the board as having the property
that any poker chips placed within this square are deemed to belong to Plato?

The problem with the poker chip analogy is that it side steps the point that
VTs and VT holdings are a legal fiction.  They do not exist, even as pieces of
plastic, and cannot exist as real pieces in an e-mail based game such as we
have at this time.  It is necessary then for us to create "legal fictions" in
order to have certain entities possess certain things called Currencies.  We
also need to create legal fictions that describe the movement of Currencies
between entities.  The Transfer Order is a Rule sanctioned method of legal
deeming, i.e. it creates the legal fiction that one entity's Currency holdings
have decreased and another entity's Currency holdings have increased.

Now since a fiction is just that, fiction, there are no restrictions on what we
can deem.  We can deem that Plato is alive and registered in the game of Agora.
We can deem that Plato possesses .9 VTs.  There is no analogy or physical
limitation that prevents us from deeming whatever we like.  We rely on the
Rules to limit and regulate the creation of legal fictions.  One way of deeming
is to pass a proposal that creates a rule.  In this case, the Rules specify
another method of creating a legal fiction that VTs are moved from one entity
to another, the Transfer Order.  However the Rules do *not* specify any
limitations on which entities can be deemed to possess currencies.  Whatever is
not prohibited is permitted and can be accomplished, subject only to being
possible. Since it is possible to deem anything, if the Rules permit Zefram to
deem that e transfers .9 VTs to Plato, then e has so deemed.

As an aside, I believe Michael's judgement regarding Zefram's transfer of a VT
to another VT is correct.  But not for the stated reason that it just doesn't
make (common) sense.  I think it is a reasonable interpretation of the TO Rule
that the target entity must be uniquely and unambiguously identifiable.  Since
Zefram had multiple VTs at the time of the transfer, it is impossible to
uniquely identify which VT is the target of the transfer (VTs are
indistinguishable from each other).  Therefore that particular TO of Zefram's
was invalid.

Yes, I believe you have replied to this objection, although it was never
directed at you.  I still do not agree, as I have described in the post I have
just submitted.  The difference in our viewpoints seems to me that you
understand the concept of 'possession' in Agora as a direct analogy to physical
possession (such as with poker chips), while I understand the concept of
'possession' in Agora as an instance of legal deeming.

To say they don't need defending is just a way of saying everyone should know
why it's "plainly" evident.  But that doesn't mean there isn't an explanation,
nor does it mean that it really is plainly evident to everyone.  It means that
it is likely that whenever someone hears the explanation they will say "Of
course, that's obvious".  It's common sense that you do not touch the metal
surface of a pot on the stove when the fire is lit under it.  But if a little
three-year old asks me why e shouldn't do that, I don't say to em "because it's
common sense", I say to em, "because you will burn your hand".

I think all of these are good, common sense arguments for why the Rules
*should* prevent long dead philosophers or arbitrary entities from possessing
Currencies, but this is the first time in my (admittedly limited) experience
with Agora that I have seen the argument that "it is this way because it should
be this way" prevail, especially amongst such veteran Players.

Game custom doesn't apply, IMO, because prior to the current situation we had
Treasuries.  It is the destruction of Treasuries which opened up this situation
in the first place.

I stand by my contention that whatever external standards you want to apply as
to capacity, they cannot limit the content of a legal deeming, they can only
limit the ability to deem.  I firmly believe that transferring VTs is a form of
legal deeming.

Here is an instance where the "best interests of the game" seems to me to be
the worst criteria.  This is what feels to me like the "it's that way because
it should be that way" argument, which I thought most Agorans held in
disrepute.

Deceased persons are clearly incapable of possessing anything in a
natural sense, and there is no justifiable legal purpose or benefit in
allowing deceased persons to continue to have attributed possession of
objects past a time sufficient to dispose of those possessions in an
orderly fashion.

Agora's Rules are thoroughly silent on who or what has the capacity to
possess objects.  In my opinion, Rule 116 does not apply; this is not
a case of permission, but one of capacity.  The Rules, by default, are
silent on capacity, and so Rule 217's external standards come into
play.  

Game Custom marginally disfavors allowing arbitrary objects from
possessing Currencies, but not strongly.  I have already detailed my
opinion as to what common sense entails in this situation.  I am not
aware of any definitive past Judgements.  And, finally, I feel that it
is marginally in the best interest of the game that long-dead Greek
philosophers be denied the capacity to possess Currencies, as allowing
it permits (and even encourages) Players to impose extra tedium on
Recordkeepors (and now, due to the Stranded Currency Rule, the
Chancellor) by making pointless and inane transfers of Currency to all
sorts of phantasmagoric entities.

I notice that you have not considered any of my remarks.

I would have expected that you would at least agree that there is a
conflict with Rule 754 the way you are stating this.

And if you don't want me to vote 2*AGAINST you better answer my claim that
just because the Recordkeepor's does not have to record a TO, that does in
no way imply that this TO does not take effect.

About as relevant as arguing about amoebae to decide whether living beings
could possibly fly.

Remember that Agora has evolved from Nomic World, not from face-to-face
nomic, and has been ruled by a Platonic philosophy through most of its
existence.  The abstraction is highly ingrained.

Of course, there are some Players who want us to return to the amoeba
stage.

Theory (itself common sense): Common sense is a mechanism whereby humans
absorb the knowledge of others without regard for the reliability or
reasons of that knowledge.  Of course, this common sense will then become
your own knowledge and be passed on to others, unless you should find
sufficient contradictory evidence to remove it from your own "knowledge
base".

This is not submitted as a Judgement.

> 
> ======================================================================

To begin with, let me note that both Caller and Judge appear to be
in agreement that a conflict between Rules 790 and 1006, with 790
having the higher precedence, results in a situation where a person
who is not a Player may under some circumstances come to "hold an
Office". Further, the Courts have not at this time been called upon 
to examine this issue, which I will therefore not adress.

The Caller's opening remarks constitute, in my opinion, an
unfortunate restatement of the two key provisions of Rule 1006,
which I will therefore quote again :

      An Office is a position of authority or responsibility
      established by the Rules and held by a Player, who is called an
      Officer.

      At any time, an Office is held by exactly one Player; if no
      other Rule directly or indirectly specifies which Player holds
      an Office, it shall be held by the Speaker.

Both of these provisions would in their own right prevent a person
who is not a Player from acceding to the "position of authority or
responsibility" that we know as an Office, or from being conferred
"whatever duties, responsibilities, or privileges" the Rules assign
to such a position.

The Caller's restatement of the first of these provisions, as "An 
Officer is a Player holding an Office", is in my opinion unwarranted.
It is logically equivalent to "All Officers are Players who hold an 
Office", whereas the actual wording is logically equivalent to "All 
Players who hold an Office are Officers", two statements which are 
definitely not equivalent to each other.

The Caller would, in light of the foregoing, have us read Rule 790 
in a manner slightly different from its actual wording; would have 
Rule 790 interpreted to mean

      An Office is "held in the normal fashion" if and only if the
      Player holding that Office was elected to that Office (...)

I agree that this wording would require us to conclude that a person 
holding an Office could not be said to hold that Office "in the 
normal fashion".

However, Rule 790 does state "if the Officer holding that Office",
etc. In normal circumstances, we would look to Rule 1006 to
determine which person this is referring to.

However, while Rule 1006 does give a definition of the term "Officer" 
that is useful whenever the situation is such that an Office is held 
by a person who is a Player, that definition most certainly does not 
apply to non-Players. Therefore, and this is the crucial point,

  Rule 1006 is silent as to whether persons who hold an Office and 
  are not Players are "Officers".

The Caller's undue emphasis on the use of the word "Officer" in Rule 
790 is thus misleading; the question at hand must be resolved by an 
appeal to Rule 1006, not 790, and, that Rule being silent on the 
issue, by appeal to the standards listed in Rule 217.

It is this Justice's opinion that "Officer" is an adequate label to
refer to a person holding an Officer, for want of a more appropriate
label. I therefore Sustain Judge Vlad's Judgement of FALSE.

Be that as it may, Rule 1601 does not make the effectiveness of
terminating Probate dependent on whether the steps have been properly
performed.

So I assume that in any case, Swann has left Probate.

OK, as long as it isn't my remarks that you resent :-)

Pine was acting up last night for me too, I am sure I lost at least one
mail and a couple others were fused with ^@s in between (I guess it didn't
help that I got impatient and killed pine.)  Must be cosmic rays or the
ozone layer.

Are you asking "Why not logical"?  If so, I would answer that if a dead person
can own Currencies at time t, then without any legislative proscriptions, there
is no logical reason why the same dead person could not own Currencies at time
t+1.  I am using "logical" in the strict, mathematical sense, not in the more
general sense of "reasonable" or "common sensical".

If that is not what you are asking, then I don't understand your question.  8)

Sorry, pet peeve.

This is from spam.abuse.net's Responsible Anti-spam Sites List:

   Hotmail (26 Aug 1997)
          AUP: Hotmail Terms of Serivce, Section 12
          Abuse contact: abuse@hotmail.com
          
          Since Hotmail offers free e-mail, they are particularly
          attractive to spammers who are looking to use a return address
          on their spams. However, Hotmail does not tolerate this and
          will nuke spammers' accounts without mercy.


It's sad, really, and just proves my previous point about common sense. I
search my mail/spam mailbox for the string hotmail, and I find:


1. A frustrated letter from abuse@hotmail.com, an ordinary user with a
badly chosen username.
1. My reply to him, explaining that I sent it to hotmail by mistake.
1. Some hotmail members hit by the same spam, everyone listed in the To:
header.
3. get rich quick scam, forged to appear to be from hotmail.
1. get rich quick scam, requesting "remove" requests be sent to hotmail.
Yeah right.
2. A spam requesting _genuine_ replies to hotmail. Wow. It wasn't actually
sent from hotmail, though.
22. Pornography ad, forged to appear to be from hotmail.
5. Home workers needed, forged to appear to be from hotmail.
4. Reply from an ISP to a complaint about a spam forged to appear to be
from hotmail.
1. Reply from an ISP in batches of 30 to all of us who complained,
including a person from hotmail.
4. Credit related spam, forged to appear to be from hotmail.
1. Gift shop spam, forged to appear to be from hotmail.
1. Bouncing complaint about spam forged to appear to be from hotmail.
2. Ad for air couriers, forged to appear to be from hotmail.
1. Cable descrambler ad, forged to appear to be from hotmail.
11. My complaint about some spam forged to appear to be from hotmail.
1. My complaint about a Usenet spam for free IQ testing, apparently the
poster has a hotmail address (the IQ test is somewhere else.)
1. Automated reply from an ISP to a complaint about a spam forged to
appear to be from hotmail.
1. A mail from chrism@genesisnetwork.net, who is apparently incapable of
reading my complaint, and somehow has got the impression that his domain
cannot possibly have passed the spam on to me since they have blocked
hotmail. This despite the fact that my original complaint clearly
explained that the mail did not come from hotmail, but from Mindspring.
Sheesh.
1. chrism@genesisnetwork.net's reply to my clarification. He appears to
have understood enough that he will block Mindspring (an ISP well known
for having a good anti-spam policy) as well. Double sheesh.
1. Mindspring's reply that the spamming account has been closed.  As well
as some other accounts belonging to the same person.
(Excuse me a minute, I think I just got a spam.)(Yep. Complaints sent.)
(Now where was I?)
1. My original complaint to chrism@genesisnetwork.net et al., about a spam
actually requesting replies to hotmail, but not actually sent from there.
(Darn, the complaint bounced.)(No abuse address, too small ISPs for
that I guess.)(Resending.)
1. Me resending the bounce for the above.
1. Me trying to explain things to chrism@genesisnetwork.net.
1. My complaint about a Usenet chain letter, by a smart.net user who has a
hotmail address (unless it's forged.)
1. Ad for a bulk e-mail list, forged to appear to be from hotmail.
1. Me resending the bounce for a complaint about some spam forged to
appear to be from hotmail.
(Bounced again?)(No webmaster address either. Resending.)

I guess it is time to clean out the folder again, soon...


But the point was: There are actually just two spams generally involving
hotmail there, but dozens of forgeries.


It is as if someone accused the US president of robbing a lot of banks
because the actual robbers were using masks with his picture.


My guess is, the main thing hotmail has done wrong lately is _not_ suing
those spammers for the forgeries.  Maybe they'll learn from AOL.

Greetings,
rjan.

Formalizing a Declaration of Absence would distinguish between electing
to not Vote (count toward Quorum) and failing to Vote.  Feel free to
discuss how this relates to the question of how high Quorum should be.

In that case, I would respond by noting that "owning" something is
a radically different notion depending on whether the owner is alive
or dead.  A living person who owns a television, for example,
has at least some measure of control over the television; not
so for the dead person who owns a television.  A dead person's
belongings may be disposed of according to the applicable
laws; this would be theft if done to a living person's belongings.

Let us distinguish between these two by caling the sort of
ownership held by living people in real life "strong-ownership,"
and the type of ownership held by the dead in real life "weak-ownership."

I would agree that if a dead person strong-owned currencies at
time t, there is no logical reason why the same dead person
could not own currencies at time t+1.  But weak-ownership is
a different sort of beast.  Weak-ownership, unlike strong-ownership,
confers no rights upon the owner.  Rather, it is just a place-holder
for the ownership of various properties until they can be properly
disposed of.

Disclaimer: this is something of a devil's advocate argument for me, as I'm on
the fence at the moment as to whether Plato might properly own Currencies
within Agora.  It might be more appropriate to take the above argument
as one arguing that in RL, there is a logical, non-legislative argument
as to why a dead person may own things at time t but not at time u>t.

Sorry, I haven't been following this discussion too closely.
What would the difference, as far as Proposal results go,
between electing to not vote and failing to vote?  And if
there is none, why make the distinction?

I am considering re-registering, but first of all I'd like two things
explained to me:

1) How does the new currency system work. I really don't understand it.
2) What effect will my current Zombie-like existance have on my 
   registration?

If the Declaration of Absence counts towards quorum, what is the difference
between that and a Declaration of Presence?
