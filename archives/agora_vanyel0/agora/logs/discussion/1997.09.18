I'd go for a higher number, say 8. This would also require a change 
in the Plots proto (which is also an attempt to regulate the currency 
in play, although it appears to have been slightly mangled in my 
absence).

I would think that it would be a good idea to have VTs in the Bank be 
distributed randomly like Indulgences are, probably with extra 
representation for Officers (and Farm-holders). Or divided evenly, 
with the excess divided randomly, which is more fair. [But is that a 
good thing? :-) ]

Which gives us the same result as 1), for all intents and purposes.

I think it would be interesting to indulgence-ize all currencies: Cap 
the number in circulation; Have anything 'spent' be returned to the 
Players randomly; give rewards (salaries, etc.) as extra chances to 
get currency, or as 'quantum' currency, or allow officers to set 
fees.

Hmmm... my Lucre/Edicts idea might be interesting... <originally 
proposed in Rishonomic>

Basically: Players get a currency called Lucre for just playing. They 
can spend this to either create a new Edict, create a duplicate of an 
existing Edict, or buy a random Edict from the Bank. Edicts are like 
Power Cards, and return to the Bank when used unless an Edict says 
otherwise (Disintegrate?).

I thought it would be interesting :-)

Two points: remember Marks back in the _old_ days, when the Bank owed
Mark debts about equal to four times the total Marks in circulation?
Also, if you do this, make sure that the Chancellor is exempt from
Persistent Debt on behalf of the Bank. :)

Surely. Contradictory precedents are only to be expected when dealing
with contradictory Rules, as I take the Frankenstein Rule to be. I
think there are Frankenstein Monsters at the moment, aren't there - 
the various Contestmasters?

True, you did send new Players copies of the Frankenstein Rule.
However, as this was generally permitted anyway, I do not believe
this establishes any Game Custom that FR=FM.  Why?  Consider the
following: you also sent the Registrar's Report to new Players
(in the course of sending it to all players).  If we were to accept
your argument, it seems to me that the same argument would support
the identity of the Frankenstein Monster with the Registrar's Report!

Looking again at R115, I find I like this reading of the second
sentence. It does indeed make sense to think of the authority of a
rule change as resting, at least partly, with R103, and so read the
second sentence as allowing amendments which make amendments illegal,
perhaps by modifying that Rule in some way. This fits nicely with the
provision on R116 that changing the rules is allowed only when a rule
or set of rules implicitly or explicitly permits it.

But R108 is not a rule change, but a Rule. In particular, it's not a
self-amending or self-repealing Rule, and hence cannot provide
the right sort of test case. For reference, here's the third sentence
of Initial Rule 115:

     No rule change or type of move is impermissible solely on account
     of the self-reference or self-application of a rule.

The crucial question concerning the stronger claim then becomes: if
the stronger claim is true (that is, if the most consistent and
coherent reading of the Initial Ruleset yields an interpretation of
'rule change' such that rule changes may be adopted only as the
direct result of the adoption of a proposal) are self-repealing and
self-amending Rules impermissible solely on account of their
self-referentiality or self-applicability? Now I suppose that the
answer to this question might well be 'no': they are impermissible
not because they are the result of the self-applicability of a Rule,
but because of quite general considerations about the permissibility
of rule changes, considerations which rule out other-directed as well
as self-directed rule changes. If that's right (and I have to admit it
sounds pretty reasonable to me), then you're quite right: I don't have
to prescind to (*); I can defend the stronger claim.

Thankyou, Michael, for a most illuminting response!

That amounts to the same thing. The above was shorthand for stating
that a message which purports to contain a PO must contain an order;
what 1596 dictates is that to legally qualify as a PO some message or 
part of a message must order (or command or enjoin or whatever) 
someone to do something; I am of the opinion that it does *not* state 
that something which is a PO is therefore an order, which is what you 
seem to be arguing.

The Rules are empowered to call for the destruction of units of a
Currency, whatever their current ownership; if the Rule from which 
you quote had stated, '*only* a Currency's Mintor' then there might 
possibly have been a conflict, but that isn't the case.

This took me a while to think through, but I've come to a tentative
conclusion, one which supports Michael's view that the stronger claim
is defensible. The key observation seems to me to be that a self-amending
Rule would *not* be prohibited solely because it was self-referential
or self-applicable. Rather, it would be prohibited for the more general
reason that the only permissible rule changes are the ones which result
directly from the adoption of a proposal. That reason also prohibits
other-directed, not just self-directed, rule changes from taking effect
as the result of the effect or action of a Rule.

You are in error about "the identification of Blots with PO for
Indulgences". 1435 only says that a particular PO is *called* a
Blot; but it is powerless to overcome the requirement of 1596 that a
message purporting to *be* a Blot must be an order, and mention an
amount of a Currency, and a Payor, and a Payee, which "Mark gains 3
Blots" fails to comply with in all respects save two.

In particular, I also contend that a message stating "Mark gains X
Blots" does not claim, of itself, that it is a PO (which as I noted
is sufficient for such a message to satisfty the 'order' provision
of 1596). Rather, such a message says "Mark gains X POs", which is
somewhat strange. You'd have to say "This message is X Blots for
Mark" for it to be valid under 1596 (and that also sounds weird).

Rule 1435 is severely flawed, keep that in mind. The problem here is 
that 1435 permits us to call some particular class of PO a 'Blot'. 
But it does not in any way make it possible to issue a PO that is not 
in all respects fulfilling the requirements of Rule 1596; it's just a 
shorthand. For all we know, something that is *not* a PO could quite 
possibly also be called a Blot.

So if you issue a message stating "X receives Y Blots", it is my 
considered opinion that you have not executed a PO; but that if in 
the past someone has executed a PO calling for X to transfer Y 
Indulgences to the Bank, you would be perfectly justified in 
referring to that event, in the Public Forum, as "X received Y 
Blots". That is the extent of 1435's provisions.

I don't think that this was an assumption of my article. What I took
myself to be offering there was not the 'real' or 'one true'
interpretation of the Initial Ruleset, but rather, that interpretation 
which I think best makes sense of the language employed there. But I
was careful to note that other interpretations are possible, and
defensible. If they are adopted, (as indeed, they were as a matter of
historical fact), then they are no less 'real' than mine. In fact,
they are possibly more real, since after all they actually were
adopted, whereas mine never has been as far as I know.

Absolutely. I cannot emphasize enough that I am not a Judicial Realist.
That is, I do not believe that judges do not make law, but only discover it.
Hence, in offering the argument in the article that I did, I was not
claiming to have discovered the one true and correct interpretation of
the Initial Set.

>In that sense I would expect that Suber emself would not be able to
>say whether (*) is true in eir initial rule set - he'd say "It depends

Indeed, that's almost verbatim what he *has* said when similar
questions have arisen in the past. For instance, one of the early
Nomic World judicial decisions was that the meaning of 'achieve'
in R208:

208. The winner is the first player to achieve 100 (positive) points.

was 'achieve *exactly*'. Rather naively (it now seems to me), I asked
Suber whether this reading was the one he had intended, and his reply
was that he had no particular intentions as to how terms in the
Ruleset should be interpreted, and that this was a matter for
individual judges in individual games to settle.

I think the above example shows that you need feel no discomfort. The
issues really have nothing to do with relativism. However, lest you
be misled by the example given above, I should stress that from the
fact that more than one argument is acceptable, it doesn't follow
that all arguments are equally good. The example of R208 happens to
be a case where the two interpretative options probably are about
equally good; to the extent that that's true, the judge's decision in
that case was, in a sense, arbitrary. The case concerning (*) in my
article is different in that I think there's a non-arbitrary sense in
which (*) is the best-justified interpretation of the meaning of
'rule change'.  [As it happens, I'm now convinced, thanks to Michael
Norrish, that in fact the stronger claim and not (*) is the best
interpretation.]

Does it make any difference that I both took myself to be, and
explicitly stated that I was, sending them the FR in order to satisfy
the requirement that I send them the FM? If not, then I can turn
your argument around: if your argument was sound then new Players to
whom I had sent the Welcome Wagon message could argue that they had
no reason to think that that particular message was the Welcome Wagon
even though it was marked clearly as such. But surely such an objection
is absurd.

It pays to be careful here: there are things that messages can be
which parts of messages cannot be. My view about Payment Orders
is that they are messages of certain kind; when we have an example
of a message of this kind, we may take the message as ordering or
commanding or enjoining someone to pay something. There is no
necessity for the message to contain the words 'order', 'command'
or 'enjoin' or any other imperative. The message itself is an
imperative.

Secondly, I'm of the view that definitions serve both purposes,
yours and mine. Consider a simpler example:

A cat is an animal of the species _felus domesticus_.

This definition can be used in two ways. If you have something
that you already know independently is a cat, then you can use the
definition to tell you what species this animal you have belongs
to. On the other hand, if you have something that you know 
independently is an animal of the species felus domesticus, then
you can use the definition to tell you that this creature is a
cat.

So, if we have something which we independently know is a Payment
Order (say, because we independently know it's a Blot, and we know
that a Blot is a Payment Order), then we know that what we have here 
is a message which commands or enjoins someone to pay Indulgences
to the Bank. On the other hand, if we have something which we 
independently know is an order enjoining someone to pay something
(because that's what it says), then we know that what we have is a
Payment Order.

I've thought about this economy issue a bit, and have some ideas...

Limited amounts of Currency are good.  They would naturally result in
the Bank being unable to satisfy its debts from time to time, but there
is a solution to this: tax.  Whenever the Bank runs out of Currency it
can impose a direct proportional tax on all Currency holdings.  This has
the side effect that all amounts of capital become insignificant in
the long term.  In the absence of any spending, Currency holdings will
asymptotically approach a stable state of all being in proportion to
long-term mean incomes.

This system would encourage spending; if you don't spend it now, it
will disappear.  It would also incidentally encourage prompt payment of
amounts owing to the Bank -- delaying payment could trigger a round of
taxation, after which the amount owing would be a greater proportion of
one's capital.

Let us suppose that a new Currency is to be created using this taxation
system.  This is to be general purpose Currency, so for want of a better
name, I shall call it Florins (abbreviation Fl).  (Aside: multiple
Currencies don't work.  Of our three main Currencies -- VTs, P-Notes
and Indulgences -- one is uninteresting, one is dead, and only one is
in any way interesting.  In RL it takes a lot of economic activity to
make speculating on currencies worthwhile.  I think we should aim for
a single Currency, used for all purposes.)

If the total amount of Florins is supposed to be some multiple of the
number of Players, it is easy to keep it that way.  When a Player joins,
the correct amount of Florins is created; when a Player deregisters,
the same amount is destroyed *from the Bank*.  If that takes the Bank
negative, so be it -- it will recover in the next round of taxation.

What can one do with Florins?  We have the basic problem of not having
any tangible goods to exchange for them.  We do, however, have:

* The enjoyment of the game
    If one has to pay a weekly fee in order to stay registered, Players
    will be encouraged to contribute to the game (which should be the
    only way to get Florins -- see below).  I'm not sure that this is
    really a good idea, but it does illustrate a principle.

* Voting rights
    We've tried this in a couple of forms that haven't sparked much
    interest.  But what if one had to pay some small weekly fee to
    have the right to vote (without further cost) on all Proposals
    up for Vote?  To discourage Players from paying this fee only when
    there are interesting Proposals, there should be a three or four week
    delay in effect -- pay now to have Voting rights three weeks hence.
    This should encourage Players to maintain their Voting rights (if
    they can afford them), and would encourage Voting by making it free
    at the time of Voting.  As a side effect of the delay, new Players
    will be unable to Vote for the first three weeks, further protecting
    us from possible invasion.

* Extra influence
    Extra Votes on a Proposal should be buyable.  But this fits in
    with the previous quite neatly: it could be made possible to buy
    `extra' Voting rights even if one doesn't have normal Voting rights.
    We could allow any combination of regular influence, bought by
    weekly fee three weeks in advance, and extra influence, bought per
    Proposal at the time of Voting.  A linear scale should suffice, if
    Florins are sufficiently scarce.  Extra influence should, of course,
    be much more expensive than regular influence.

* Indulgence
    We've seen what a Currency used for paying fines can do.

* Authorship of Rules
    Replacing P-Notes.

* Legal process
    If we introduce some kind of civil court, we might reasonably impose
    a fee for its use.  We really need some concept of a tort to make
    this work.

And how can one earn Florins?  I think they sould be earned by
contributing to the game, so random distribution is right out.
Official and Judicial Salaries, and rewards for successful Proposals
should suffice.

Option 1 seems to me to both more of a pain, and more interesting than
Option 2.  Go for #1.

Looking at the list I see there is at least one missing: The one that
got Swann a D.N.Hist. IIRC it was about the Mousetrap-scam. There is also
only one Thesis of Steve, while according to the Registrar's Report he
is both B.N. and D.N.Phil. Of my own Thesis there is no result recorded.
It failed Quorum.

No, but the procedure for collecting taxes only works simply for
integer amounts. Otherwise you'd need lots of division rounding rules

Why, but they do: call for judgment with a statement that you did
cease to be so, and have it judged true.

What _is_ missing in the rules is criteria for when you become and
when cease to be a tax evader. And this is an open question I have: Do
you want such criteria spelt out in the rules, or wuldn't it be fun to
try and develop such criteria just within the judicial system,
allowing judges to look at particular situations and go on from there?

I agree with most of your observations and ideas. Do you think that my
Robin Hood proposal would be a step in the direction you suggest?

Of course, as usual, the nitpicking gets more space than the general
agreement, but zefram wrote:

Official and Judicial Salaries, and rewards for successful Proposals

I don't think these are the only valid contributions to the game. It
is very constructive and not an inherently inferior contribution if
some players "just" read and occasionally join the discussions, and
only influence the game state proper through eir votes on proposals
and elections. So there should be some reward for doing that, as there
is now.

Not everyone wants to and can afford to take a more active role in the
game, but as long as people vote and don't destroy quorum all the
time, they are still important.

What you have failed to respond to, in my opinion, is the contention
that "Mark gains 3 Blots" is _implicitly_ an order, and that it
_implicitly_ specifies a Payee (the Bank) and a Currency
(Indulgences).  This position has substantial merit, and I think you
have been remiss to ignore it.

A Welcome Wagon once existed, but I think its contents were long since

Here is a proto of Swann's Thesis:


Mousetrap: A brief history of the events of Fall 1995, the last
great Agora scam, and a view of Agora beyond the game.

by S. Andrew Swann
with thanks to Players Steve and elJefe for their comments.
============================================================

     As I write this, almost exactly a year has passed since the 
     infamous Proposal 1760 and the subsequent, and more infamous, 
     Mousetrap scam.  Upon reflection it's hard to credit the upheaval 
     and the personal recriminations that erupted out of one simple 
     idea, but it is a prime example of how Agora, if it is really a 
     "game" at all, is a political game, and possibly the most overtly 
     political nomic in existence.

     In the fall of 1995 an idea was floating around the Nomic aether. 
     There were, then as now, several entities outside the Ruleset that 
     could bind a Player to action much in the same way that the Rules 
     could.  Groups, Contests and Contracts all involved some sort of 
     Ruleset-like entity.  Two Players, Swann and Kelly, both came up 
     with very similar unification ideas nearly simultaneously.  Warring 
     Protos peppered the Public Forum, along with less pretty 
     accusations back and forth.  By the time both proposals appeared in 
     the _same_ distribution, the respective legislative authors were 
     taking each other, and their proposals, very personally.

     The voting on 1760 and its rival has to stand as a landmark of 
     political wrangling in Agora.  Every Player then in the game found 
     emself cajoled, or bribed outright, by one proposer, or the other, 
     or both.  The voting itself set a record for EV expenditure. 
     
     Proposal 1760 passed, and with the passage of 1760, one storm had 
     ended, another had just begun.

     A persistent minority believed that adopting 1760 was a very big 
     mistake, and that a wide swath of the Ruleset had been done serious 
     damage by the legislation.  As one example, Player elJefe-- a 
     member of the group the Threat-- felt keenly that a number of Group 
     Rules which dated from Agora prehistory had been seriously 
     undermined, that a rock-solid chunk of the Ruleset had become 
     porous and eroded.  Another member of the Threat was Kelly, author 
     of the rival legislation, and the most profound and serious critic 
     of 1760 and its effects.

     It was only natural, considering that 1760's opposition was already 
     centralized within a single Group, that the Threat would undertake 
     a serious internal examination of the proposal's effects, as well 
     as its potential loopholes.  One of the first results of this 
     internal discussion was a CFJ alleging that the adoption of 1760 
     had abolished every Group, Contest and Contract that had been in 
     existence at the time of its adoption.  That was just a mere shadow 
     of what was in store.

     To understand the ultimate attempt to exploit the perceived flaws 
     in the effects of 1760, one has to first understand how 1760 
     attempted to unify such diverse elements as Groups, Contracts, and 
     Contests.  In essence, what it did was create a superclass of 
     "Organizations" that had each element (Groups, Contests, et al.) as 
     a singular instance of a particular Class of Organization.  Every 
     Organization had a Compact that was to only have power of those 
     Players within its Jurisdiction. The Jurisdiction was a well
     defined and limited group of Players for each _defined_ Class of 
     Organization.

     It is also worthwhile to understand the checkered history of 
     Contests.  Contests were the brainchild of Player elJefe.  They 
     permitted the creation of sub-games of Agora, allowing a Ruleset-
     like set of Regulations to bind the actions of Players and the 
     Contestmaster.  However, since Contests could be created by a 
     single Player, any loophole in the initial Contest rule was wide 
     open to scamming by anyone who saw it.  There _was_ such a
     loophole, and it was scammed ruthlessly.  The Contest Rules
     inadvertently allowed Contestmasters to be drafted against their
     will, to come under the control of the Contest Regulations.
     A half-dozen scams sprouted from this one flaw, until elJefe
     stepped in with a Contest that essentially scammed the loophole to
     bar any future Contests until the loophole was plugged.  The
     loophole-plugging was effective, and there's a consensus that what
     elJefe did was a Good Thing.

     Thus, in elJefe's words, "it was appropriate that I was the one 
     that spotted what I still believe was a valid loophole--  creating 
     a generic Organization, which could then be the basis for a whole-
     game takeover."   This was the genisis of the Mousetrap; The idea 
     that there was enough leeway in the Rules as amended for a group of 
     players to create a Organization of an undefined Class, and 
     therefore above the restrictions placed on the Jurisdiction for 
     particular Classes.  The Compact of such an undefined Class of
     Organization could, in theory, extend to everyone in the Game, just
     as the prior flawed Contest Rules could draft anyone a into being a
     hapless Contestmaster.

     So Threat drafted the Mousetrap, a Classless Organization that had 
     a Jurisdiction of infinite extent.  The similarity to the prior 
     scam to close the Contest loophole was undeniable.  One of the 
     major elements of the Mousetrap was the prevention of any future 
     Mousetrap-like Compacts from seizing power.  In retrospect, the 
     motives in forming it were also similar.  As an example of its 
     essential loophole-closing nature, Steve, the third member of the 
     Threat, wisely points out:

     "The Mousetrap Compact *could* have been written to entangle the 
     Judicial system, [...] it could have bound all non-Members of the 
     Threat to decline to Judge any CFJ. Had it done so, the Mousetrap 
     scam almost certainly would have precipitated a genuine crisis, a 
     situation where the Rules do not have the resources to resolve a 
     legal dispute between Players. [...] The fact that it was possible 
     to resolve the Mousetrap situation in a relatively orderly way 
     through the courts was due to the restraint shown by Kelly, Jeff 
     and I in drafting the Mousetrap Compact."

     If the goal of the Mousetrap had been different, authority over the 
     Judicial system would have been a priority.
     
     In a more succinct illustration of the motives behind the 
     Mousetrap, elJefe had believed that the Mousetrap could have 
     "sprung as a Tabula-style junta, absolute in power and quickly 
     abandoned, hopefully without too much popular upheaval."
     
     Unfortunately, that belief turned out to be very far from the 
     truth.  Despite the similarity to the prior attempt to scam closed 
     the Contest loophole, the effect the Mousetrap had upon the Game 
     was very different.

     There are three major reasons for the explosive reaction the 
     Mousetrap caused, none of which can be strictly be said to have 
     much to do with the intent of the Mousetrap Compact, its ultimate 
     effect, or with the perceived loopholes in the Organization Rules:

     First, while the Mousetrap wisely steered clear of the Judicial 
     system, (Stemming from Steve's prior experiences with a coup d'etat 
     in Nomic World and the effects that had in paralyzing the Nomic 
     World Judicial system, forcing-- essentially-- a restart of the 
     game with a new Ruleset.) it did exercise its temporal power beyond 
     the shutting of the loophole, something elJefe's Contest scam did 
     not do.  This exercise was focused around the Office of Notary, 
     which was ironically was swinging back and forth between Kelly and 
     Swann, the principal legislative rivals over the Organization 
     Rules.  Kelly was then Speaker, with the duties of that then-vacant
     Office until it could be legally filled.  As Speaker, Kelly had for
     a time delegated the duties of the Office to Swann.  Later on
     during the controversy, but before the creation of the Mousetrap,
     Kelly rescinded the delegation.  This was not the end of the
     swinging Officership, since Swann had nominated emself for the
     vacant position, and was eventually "elected" (elections were by
     random selection then) to the Office of Notary.

     All this business of the Notary is relevant for three reasons; the 
     Notary was given the oversight of the Organization Rules, the cause 
     of all the controversy; and the Mousetrap Compact had already been 
     drafted and formed at the time Swann was elected; and the Mousetrap 
     Compact forbade Swann from taking the Office of Notary.  This made 
     some sense, given the duties of the Office, but it ended up
     generating a lot of bad feelings unnecessarily, and came to be seen 
     as much less benign.

     The second thing that turned the debate ugly was the bad element of 
     timing involved.  Most scams are plotted, then presented as a _fait 
     acompli_ once they have achieved fruition. This was, in fact, the 
     thinking behind the Mousetrap.  It was formed, and did nothing for 
     several days, to be a surprise when someone tried to attempt the 
     exploitation of the same loophole.  There was even a hope to see
     several harmless generic Organizations, if only to establish the
     legal principle on which the Mousetrap was based. Unfortunately,
     the surprise came when Swann was elected Notary.  As to what
     happened next, elJefe says; "If someone had wanted to wage 
     psychological warfare on Agora, they could not have done better."

     The first anyone outside the Threat heard of the Mousetrap was when 
     Swann was told e was in violation of its Compact. In response, 
     Swann generated a raft of CFJs, all before anyone outside the 
     Threat had even _seen_ the Compact itself.  The Players were 
     suddenly aware of the possibility of a Compact they'd never heard 
     of having Jurisdiction over them.  This was compounded when the 
     first FOIA requests got a reply illuminating another loophole that 
     could allow the Compact's recordkeepor to sit on FOIA requests 
     indefinitely due to a missing ASAP clause.  Even though the 
     recordkeepor of the Mousetrap wasn't sitting on the Compact-- it 
     seems to be a simple case of e-mail lag-- the damage was done.  It 
     would be hard to imagine a more inauspicious debut for the 
     Mousetrap as it was drafted.

     The last element that soured the scam was what Steve refers to as 
     "a certain democratic ideal which exists in the game."  This is 
     where the political nature of this "game" can truly be seen.  While 
     there is a feeling on Steve's part, which perhaps extends to the 
     members of Threat as a whole, that Agora is at root only a game, 
     like chess or Monopoly, wherein every move within the structure of 
     the Rules is acceptable, and the only place for moralizing is in 
     personal conduct, not in the moves within the structure of the 
     game.  There is certainly basis for this view, but there is also 
     basis for saying that a majority of Agorans don't ascribe to it.

     The opposite view, away from the "game," sees Agora more like a 
     "society."  Viewing Agora this way, it is seen more like a 
     professional organization, or a legislature, whose jurisdiction 
     extends mostly-- but not necessarily-- into itself.  Agora could, 
     quite easily, turn itself into a nomic fan club with effects 
     outside the "game--" such as raising funds, mailing flyers, or
     holding conventions-- without essentially changing its structure.  
     The mere fact that it doesn't actually perform these, or any, 
     extra-game functions does not diminish the reactions the Players to 
     certain game actions.  An action which confines itself completely 
     within the game, that would be truly reprehensible in a "game" such 
     as the hypothetical nomic fan club, tends to be seen in a similar 
     light in Agora, even though Agora has nothing to do with "real 
     life." Agora's own longevity may contribute to this societal point 
     of view, and it may be a function of nomic evolution. (If the 
     Players have been in a Game for over a year, they don't wish to 
     "break" it.)  In Steve's words, "I think Players do tend to forget 
     that Agora is just a game. . ."

     The Mousetrap was a gaming action that was perceived by most in a 
     societal manner, which was not helped by the inauspicious way the 
     Mousetrap was revealed to the Agora populace.

     Players began objecting, and the first deregistrations began, a 
     protest to being bound by a document they had never seen.  Feelings 
     were compounded by an even worse example of timing:  A new Player 
     registered in the middle of the post-revelation controversy, and 
     attempted a similar scam before the Mousetrap Compact was itself
     revealed. E was assured that the Mousetrap forbade this, and the
     new Player began angrily accusing the members of the Threat of
     lying about the Mousetrap's priority, e submitted es own CFJs, and
     eventually deregistered in disgust.

     By the time the Compact was printed in the Public Forum, the 
     rhetoric had become so heated, and the volume so elevated, that the 
     nature of the document no longer mattered in much of the debate. 
     The very existence of the Mousetrap-- or its perceived existence-- 
     was anathema.  More players threatened deregistration, or actually 
     deregistered.

     In elJefe's words, "The number of threatened and actual 
     deregistrations was probably a record for Agora. Even I was soured 
     on the game for a while, and turned away from it to other things."
     
     The combination of the above elements turned the Mousetrap Scam 
     into one of the sorrier episodes in Agora politics.  Not for the 
     scam itself, which was no better or worse than most others, but for 
     the vitriol that was expended in the subsequent arguments. Passions 
     flared as hot as I have ever seen (or felt) them, and more than one
     fourth of all the Players deregistered or threatened deregistration
     because of it.

     And, in the end, in a height of irony, two of the last Players to 
     deregister were Swann and Kelly, the Players responsible for the 
     original Proposals.

     Eventually the debate cooled off, and the CFJs and all their 
     appeals began to trickle in.  In another ironic twist, the judicial 
     consensus was that the Mousetrap never existed.  There is still 
     some belief that the loopholes were valid despite the rulings, and 
     it is quite possible-- as Steve has pointed out-- that Agora 
     history would have been different if Kelly had not deregistered and 
     had been around to serve on the Appeals of all the Mousetrap-
     generated CFJs.

     Then again, history might not have been _that_ different, since the 
     purposes of the Mousetrap wasn't to create a despotism, but to 
     exploit, and then close, a perceived loophole in the Organization 
     Rules.  A loophole, real or not, which has since been amended away.

     And, while the Mousetrap's argument was deemed flawed in the
     courts, it did lead to some decent legislation in the end.  Kelly 
     returned to the game with the SLC concept, much more flexible and 
     much less unwieldy than the Organization Rules.  We now have Rules 
     that govern the continuity of Nomic Entities.  And, finally, we now 
     have a Rule saying that no Player can be bound by a body of law
     that has not been first made available to em. 

     As a postscript, elJefe made the following, somewhat melancholic,
     observation, "This may have been the last of the Great Scams.  
     Certainly reading over the scams of yesteryear in the Agora
     Guidebook, we've not had that level of intensity since a year ago.  
     Perhaps I should count Morendil's attempt to scam Rule 113 to win 
     retroactively.  But the outlook for real paradigm-shifting scams 
     seems bleak nowadays."

     Perhaps.  But, then, the only certainty within this game is change.
     Much of the foundation of Agora is currently shifting, and in
     the shifting it is inevitable that the seeds of future scams will
     sprout-- for those who choose to water them.

But there's some ambiguity in the definition here. You might say:

A cat is an animal with four legs.

Excluding genetic mishaps and rush-hour traffic :( , this is true. And if 
you have something you know is a cat, this tells you that it has four 
legs. However, if you try to apply the second method of reasoning, i.e. 
"this has four legs, therefore it is a cat," then you are in trouble. The 
point here is not that this logic is somehow flawed, just that the 
English language creates some ambiguity here. Is it clear what sense the 
rules relating to P.O.'s and Blots, etc. are using the terms?

However, we have case law that has established Vlad's point of view as the

In researching this before, I accidentally deleted my archive version of the

knowledge, the text of this second message was basically identical to the
first, substituting "Elde" for "Blob".

"elJefe receives 3 Blots committing the Infraction of Failing to Judge."

These are the relevant portions of the three messages.

Well, I believe you have come to some wrong conclusions about the current
status quo. 

First of all, the Agora Currencies do _not_ correspond to real world
currencies, they correspond to real world tradable commodities. As such,
if we are to have a realistic economy in Agora, we _must_ have several of
them. 

I once made the hypothesis that supporting a real currency requires a far
greater number of participants than Agora has Players, and I don't recall
getting any disagreement. Therefore, I and probably others have as our
goal for Agora not a monetary economy but a barter economy, in which the
commodities unfortunately are called Currencies.

One essential feature of the current system is that you can _not_ simply
buy everything with a main currency (like your Florins) from the Bank or
similar. You have to use the right Currency. If not, there would be no
reason to trade, as people either have what they need or don't have
anything to trade with. People would just hoard the main currency and go
about their business without speaking to their neighbors (so to say.) 

Despite what some pessimists say, I believe that we are on the verge of
succeeding in creating a real economy. 

It seems to me like it is an old Agoran tradition of proclaiming a concept
unworkable just because it doesn't work on the first try, and then
dismantling the concept just before it is actually successfully repaired.
I don't much care for that tradition. 

This, on the other hand, means that I do support trying some form of Tax
like you suggest, on the principle that we haven't been able to make that
work yet. But then we should look at what prevented that from working
previously, and avoid repeating those errors this time. I think those
problems are mainly: Tax evasion through Organizations and hoarding of
money until Tax Day.

Here is an idea I thought of: do not make the Tax quite proportional, but
give a small exemption to Players. _Not_ to Organizations. This allows the
poor (like me) some protection while not making Tax Evasion so easy. Maybe
we could institute further Tax exemptions for selected philanthropic
Organizations.

One more point:

I definitely don't like this. It goes against a basic principle which I
like to keep in this game: The right to play at the level of activity that
you want.

rjan.

The goal is to create a valuable, tradable commodity (VTs). Reducing
access to voting is the means to make it valuable. 

(Having several other commodities is the means to make them tradable.)

My vision was simply to amend those Rules that make requirements for CFJs
from "A CFJ must/shall ..." into "A CFJ which doesn't ... lacks standing." 
That way, it will be clear that not following the requirements is not
actually a violation of any Rule, but just a bad idea.

But they do, in a roundabout way. Look at my judgment. There is
a Rule (with precedence) that states that procedures for the
destruction of currencies explicitly stated in the Rules have
precedence over any other methods. In other words, if a Rule-mandated
procedure exists, it *must* be used.

Couldn't that be done by just adding one sentence to 1563, like

This could even replace the current second paragraph of 1563.

I think you are right on the Mark (pun unintended) in that a
true market economy is unfeasible. But my point is that one does
not necessarily need Currencies to establish a barter economy.
Indeed, it would seem to be much simpler (and require less
recordkeeping) if we traded actions rather than representations
of actions (your proposed Currencies). Rather than trading
1 VT to Steve for a P-Note, I could simply agree to vote to
a particular proposal in exchange for Steve making a particular
proposal. What I am suggesting is that we restrict the ability
to perform certain game actions directly.

With that I agree; and also with the comment that a true currency
would probably need to be emergent, rather than legislated.  The law
may recognize the currency and regulate its trading, but I don't think
we can create a viable economy by fiat.  Viable economies tend to be
organically constructed and somewhat epiphenomenal in nature.

I tend to agree with this too.  Indulgences are looking very
promising, and I think VTs and even P-Notes can be beaten into shape
with only a moderate amount of work.

I think that a blanket fee for existence is unreasonable.  I do kinda
like the idea of buying Voting Rights either en bloc or by the piece,
though.  Could be tedious for the Assesor, but not too bad, I suspect.

I think the more liberal approach would be something like my
suggestion of convictions for tax evasion (with the expected targets
being Contests that are set up only to conceal money from the tax
collector). So every entity would start out with the same status, and
as things are now, a Robin Hood tax would only ever reach into rich
players' pockets. This only gives work to the judicial system (or to
whichever other institution we might invent to prosecute tax evasion)
when evasion actually appears, but no paperwork is necessary to
accomodate perfectly legitimate non-scam organizations (philantropic
or not).

Vlad's "decision" as you call it was an argument put forth within a
ruling to dismiss a CFJ; that part of the argument was not in
accordance with previous Judgements and Game Custom to the opposite
effect (I have already pointed that out), it was not relevant to the
decision to dismiss the CFJ (which as far as I'm concerned was not
the correct decision, as the Statement in that instance clearly, by
Vlad's own reasoning, could be Judged FALSE), and all things
considered I'm just going to ignore Vlad's musings.

As for Indulgences and P-Notes, I thought we'd merely ratified the 
relevant Reports, not that any Judicial decision (especially one to 
*dismiss* a CFJ !) was involved.

I think this could be better acheived by developing tort law, and

Unfortunately, that is wrong. Consider :

Rule 2000: All units of Currency X are destroyed when it rains in 
  Paris.
Rule 3000: Half the units of Currency X are destroyed when it rains in 
  Oslo.

There is no conflict here; there are only *two* procedures given for
the destruction of units Currency X, which can take effect
independently of one another. I find no language in 1467 or
elsewhere saying that units of Currencies may not be destroyed at
any other time.

I fail to see how a descriptive sentence framed in terms of someone
gaining something can be an order to pay something.

Yes, that works.  This way, the "general" definition of "lacks standing" gets

does not order me to do anything, explicitly, implicitly, or by
inference, because it is merely descriptive.

To use your terms, we do _not_ independently know this message to be 
a Blot, or a Payment Order.

> A cat is an animal of the species _felus domesticus_.

The above text, in a Rule, would tell us that, for instance, one
cannot claim that a something that is not an individual of that
species, e.g. a tiger, is 'a large cat'. The statement 'a Payment
Order is an order' dictates that we cannot claim that something that
is not an order is a Payment Order.

A Player wishing to make a valid Payment Order is required to frame
it in imperative terms. "Explicitly and unambiguously", as Rule 1596
has been annotated.

In our current ruleset, this is recognised because of the reforms that
led to the notion of non-proposed rule changes and also with
subsequent refinements of this idea.

Before then, we simply had game custom on our side.  This is discussed
in the initial sections of Steve's essay, before he gets down to the
business of constructing an alternative interpretation of the standard
initial ruleset.

Well, in my experience, not getting any disagreement bears little
relationship to whether people actually agree.  8)

Of course, in this case, I think most Players (including me) think you are
right.

Well, there is a problem here, since there seems to be a tendency to ignore
*my* musings, as well.

1.  I pointed out that the ratifications of Indulgences and P-Notes passed in
Harlequin's proposal were invalid because the proposal specified reports that
had already been superseded by subsequent reports, in contravention of the
requirements for ratification laid out in R1552.  No one acknowledged or
challenged this at the time.  However, the wording in R1552 is very explicit
and I'm sure I was correct in that observation.  Therefore, there has been no
ratification of P-Note or Indulgence reports since the PC proposal.

2.  I made it clear when I restored the Indulgence and P-Note holdings that I
was using Vlad's decision on that dismissed CFJ as the basis for my actions,
since there was no other decision or Player consensus on which I could base a
resolution of that crisis.  I challenged Player's at that time to appeal Vlad's
decision if they felt it was wrong.  Not a single Player appealed.

Seems to me that my actions, and the inaction of others, must have had some
effect on game custom and the interpretation of the Rules in question here (not
that this can't be reversed). Just how *does* one go about establishing new
game custom around here, anyway?

Well, that's fun. And don't think I'm not saying that honestly. 

But I do hope noone will ever want to collect taxes in Euclids; and if
someone does, I hope it will be you who either has to amend my integer
amount tax collection rule in some intricate way to make it work; or
you are at that time recordkeepor for a currency with an MUQ < 1, like
VTs, so the obvious solution (change the tax collection so you collect
one MUQ, instead of one integer unit, from each entity on the tax
payors' list in one round, and repeat the process until you've
collected enough of it) will cause you lots and lots of paperwork. I
will personally ask to see in writing the tax payors' lists for each
round!

Anyway, I admit that you have a point, but it's a matter of theory. Im
practice, the procedure I suggested will work. It will only fail in
pathological situations, and while such situations would complicate
things I don't see what anyone could gain from them, so I don't think
they will appear. You don't seriously suggest that such pathological
cases must be provided for in a first round of legislation, do you?

*ROFL*

Send me a few Pi of 'em :)

Actually, doesn't the math rule allow 3.14 to be used as an estimation of Pi,
since that's the way it is in the math world?  If not, then you wouldn't be
able to send 6.28 of 'em, but you *would* be able to send 2*Pi of 'em.

I'm not sure I remember that; but then, one obvious point is that we 
have no formal definition of what it means for a Document to be 
'superseded' by a subsequent Document. Also, at what time were those 
subsequent Documents published ? If you look at 1552, it says that 
the Documents must be current (i.e. not 'superseded') at the time the 
Proposal is Proposed, i.e. sent to the Promotor...

And _I_ pointed out that in my opinion a Judge's arguments are not 
constitutive of Game Custom, especially if they are not in accord 
with previous Judgements, or Game Custom. As far as I recall there 
wasn't any serious challenge to that either.

But anyway, remember that Game Custom takes second place to the Rules 
themselves.

Just by doing the same thing over and over again, I guess. As far as 
Game Custom driven by Judicial decisions is concerned, I guess you 
*can* affect GC in a ruling, but then only when you present a valid 
way of interpreting the Rules that is both consistent with the way 
things were done before and gives some insight as to how Rules should 
be interpreted in the future. For instance, I remember that one 
criterion that was established as Game Custom for recognizing when a 
piece of mail has been received by someone was a Judge's notion of 
that piece of mail entering that person's "normal technical domain of 
control".

Me, I still see no valid reason not to Judge 933 TRUE, and I'm
probably going to do so very shortly.

OK, now I see why you didn't want to use MUQs. However, integer units
vs MUQs aren't really the issue either: You could get the same effect
with a Currency of MUQ 1 if there were say 1 million units in circulation.

As for reducing paperwork, we might want to use something like the system
for random selections:  There is a standard way to do it, but any
equivalent procedure is permitted.

Well, in practice I would not really ask the tax collector to publish
anything but the resulting TOs, anyway. So as long as the result is
correct, I would say using "equivalent" procedures is implicitly
permitted. I just thought that spelling out an "algorithm" for the tax
collection would be easier and less ambiguous than trying to describe
the wanted result in words.

I would think that any valid interpretation of 'superseded' in this case would
include the publishing of the next report.  There was at least one subsequent
report of each published before Harlequin's proposal was submitted.

No argument from this quarter.  However, I saw no evidence of any game custom
or previous decisions that contravened Vlad's interpretation.

And there is nothing in the Rules themselves to prevent eir interpretation,
even though it may not be the 'correct' interpretation (I would probably have
joined in an appeal of Vlad's decision myself, but as the Recordkeepor most
affected by the decisions, I did not want to be the one to initiate it.)

Are you saying that a single ruling cannot establish game custom?  I don't see
Vlad's reasoning as being *inconsistent* with anything done before and it
*does* provide insight into how the Currency Rules are to be used in the future
(if we accept eir reasoning).  You may be right that it provides the wrong
insight.  I'm sure contravening it in your current ruling is a valid way of
establishing a different custom, and I think your interpretation is probably
more natural.  However, I think it would also be valid for you to use Vlad's
reasoning in your current decision, if you wanted to.

I remember seeing a reference to some other argument (by Harlequin, I think)
that claimed to refute the destruction of VTs that had nothing to do with
Vlad's interpretation.  But I never actually saw the argument.  I was hoping
this would provide me with the opportunity to see it.  8)

I've been following this discussion and I think you've hit the nail on the
head.

If I say  "John Smith is sentenced to 10 years in prison", it cannot be
concluded that I have by this statement caused him to be so sentenced even
if I have the authority to pronounce such a sentence.  This statement is
just an observation on the fact that he is so sentenced, nothing more.
However if I say "John Smith is hereby sentenced to 10 years in prison", it
does cause him to be so sentenced if I possess the necessary authority.  The
difference is that the latter statement says not only that he is so
sentenced but that the statement itself is the means by which he is
sentenced.

Thus "Mark gains 3 Blots" merely refers to the fact that he has gained 3
Blots.  The statement "Mark hereby gains 3 Blots", OTOH, actually causes him
to gain 3 Blots.  Of course, this leaves open the question of what exactly
it means to "gain a Blot."  Regardless of what that phrase is determined to
mean, the statement "Mark gains 3 Blots" cannot IMHO be seen as an order but
only as an observation. Therefore it does not satisfy the requirements of
the Rules.

I would not consider a report to supersede a previous one unless it
corrects it in some way (which may very well have happened in the case
above, however.) E.g. obviously an Assessor's Report on one Proposal batch
does not supersede a report on another batch; similarly, I would think
that if Currency report A describes holdings at a later time than report
B, then A does not in general supersede B.

Greetings,
rjan.

Alrighty... I think I have a solution to our INP voting referendum problem.

Everyone should place their vote now.  The liason then calls for a
referendum, with the start date as of that referendum and the ending date a
week before the INP deadline.  All votes then placed would be between those
two dates, would they not?

Vir, who doesn't remember the INP number, and therefore, cannot vote right
now :)

Jut ay "integer multiples of the MUQ" or somesuch.

That would be better, but I'd rather the whole thing was written
in terms of multiples of MUQs.  (Why shouldn't we be able to tax
for 1.5 VTs?)

But then you only cease to be a tax evader when the CFJ is judged
TRUE; however, judgements on CFJs must be made on the truth
of the statement at the time it was made, not the time it is
judged, and at the time the CFJ is made the person would still be
a tax evader, so such a statement could not legally be judged
TRUE, unless the Rules supplied another way to cease to be a tax
evader.

This seems like a ridiculous distinction of verbage to me. While you're 
right that the word "hereby" makes it clear that the act of making the 
statement in question is what *causes* the statement to be true, I don't 
think the reverse is true. In other words, I don't think that if a judge 
in a courtroom accidentally left out the word "hereby" and simply said 
"Chris is sentenced to 10 years in solitary confinement," I would have a 
good case for appeal.

This is only one part of this entangled web, though...

3.14 is not acceptable as a substitute for Pi in the "math world", as
far as I know.  And, yes, you cannot have 6.28 Euclids.

Actually, the rule I'm referring to is rule 40^2: Standard Mathematics.

      Except where the Rules explicitly state otherwise, any
      mathematical term in the Rules shall be construed to have the
      definition usually given to it in standard mathematics.  In
      particular,  "number" shall mean "real number."

Standard mathematics defines Pi as 3.14 ...

Vir, who is apparantly having an argument with himself :)

I'm not certain that you're correct here.  If the pronouncer is
empowered to pronounce sentence, then I think that statement is
sufficient to impose the penalty.  True, it is more traditional to
order the defendant to rise, and to state "John Smith, it is the
opinion of this court that you should be taken from this place and
placed into the the custody of the Department of Corrections to serve
a term of imprisonment of ten years.  It is so ordered," or other
phrases to the same import, but I believe it is the expression of the
opinion is sufficient when combined with authority.

Assuming that the resultant amendment was considered legal, then yes --
Chuck, Morendil, Crito, Andre, Swann, and I are all "Frankenstein
Monsters." Now we can vote and submit ISFJs as if we were Players.
Whoopeee. Oh, yes, we also have to pay out 3 P-Notes to each person
who repeals a Rule. On the other hand, we do get to define the
mechanisms for changing our own content. :)

Which reminds me: out of curiosity, does anyone out there have a copy

The biggest problem with P-Notes is that they suffer from the same
malady that VTs did immediately following the exorbitant stipend 
introduced in P2817 and the conversion of all the payouts in the
Rules to VTs with the "Down With Marks..." Proposal: they're far
too easy to come by. Eliminating or reducing all the payouts of 
P-Notes in the Rules would be a good start on fixing this. 
Lowering the MUQ to allow for smaller transactions might also 
be a good idea.

Agreed. One way to go about it would be to, rather than define PhO
in such a way that it encompasses all such Organizations, define it
with specific guidelines that all PhOs must meet if they want the
tax-exempt status. Possibilities would include not being able to 
Vote, paying out at least half its currency income in "Grants,"
and some sort of "Mission statement" or other document which
would list the particular type of philanthropy the group would
engage in.

Thank you, thank you.

Vlad, I *would* like to hear your ideas on Defense/Offence in inter-nomic 
affairs, should you have any that you would like to share.

Be careful; the Rules concerning destroying Currency were amended at
the same time as the Rule establishing the Mint.  Don't rely on the
current language of the Rules in forming an opinion; you'll have to
get a pre-3533 Ruleset from the Archivist.

As do I. "Supersede" is a more specific term than how Crito is 
interpreting it.

"Tort law" being that which allows people to collect if illegally or 
wrongly penalized or charged for something? It sounds good to me. 
I'd write a proto, but I think there are some others who could handle
it somewhat better than I.

That is not a definition, that is an approximation. While a mathematician
might consider something a definition for practical purposes if it is
obvious how to continue it - e.g.

exp(x) = 1 + x + x^2/2 + x^3/3! + x^4/4! + ...

or even take 0.0909090909... to be a way to write 1/11, the decimal digits
of Pi are far too unpredictable to be used in that way - so far they seem
to pass most statistical tests of randomness.

Standard mathematics defines \pi in a variety of ways, none of which
make it equal to 3.14 or any other finite sequence of digits.

Agreed. We *tried* the "single unifying currency" idea once before, with
Marks. It didn't work even after years of tweaking. We've barely given
the new paradigm a few months.

Anyone for changing the name to "Commodities"? I'll vote for it.

Exactly. That's what makes Indulgences so interesting -- there are two
other currencies to trade for them, in addition to various favors and
other such possibilities.

Agreed. Certainly economic activity has become more and more interesting
as time has gone on and we've changed the system more.

As far as I can see, the biggest problem with P-Notes is that they
currently have no real purpose. Sure, you can make Proposals Interested.
But what is the only major purpose of making Proposals Interested? Oh,
yes, you can get P-Notes. 

To give P-Notes value, we need some other common benefit to using
Interested Proposals. (There are some rare ones, like Emergency, but they
are not enough.)

This is an interesting idea but in such a small community the idea of 
charity is not very meaningful. There are no real upper or lower classes, 
except on a highly temporary basis. I think any organization devoted to 
helping the poor would either a) have no real effect, or b) reduce the 
'competitiveness' of the game even further.

The phrase in question is:

Neither Currencies nor units of Currency shall be created or
      destroyed except as specified by the Rules.

I interpret this to mean

Neither Currencies nor units of Currency shall be created or
destroyed except in the manner specified by the Rules.

1569 only specifies a fact, not the manner of destruction.

This is one approach.  I will endorse just about any semi-sane system;
the details are unimportant at this point.  (Any system will be
scammed, but that's (more than) half the fun.)

Would be fine with me, except by doing so someone will claim that all
Currencies ceased to exist because the various amendments will be
unavoidably separated by infinitesimal elements of time.

I have been thinking about this for some time; I think we should ban
non-proposed Rule Changes altogether and base Continuity, et al on
Proposals, rather than Rule Changes.  The present mechanisms make it
effectively impossible to make any substantial changes without
breaking everything, if only for an infinitesmial moment.

What you're offering, though, is a barter economy without contract law
to support it.  This requires you to elaborate on a list of all
possible barters in the legislation, simultaneously inserting tendrils
into dozens of different Rules (depending on how many bartering
options you wish to make available).  It seem easier to me to
establish contract law, let Players come up with their own deals, and
let the Courts enforce them.

Well, I suppose so, but for a reason. There's a long history of proposals 
and rules designed to make Agora more like "real life." For the most 
part, in my opinion, these have been unsuccessful, and rightly so: Agora, 
and Nomic in general, is *not* real life, any more than chess is real 
life. Certainly parallels can be drawn. Chess strategies can be seen as a 
metaphor for "real-life" confrontations, and certainly these parallels 
are even stronger in a game like Nomic. But when people play chess, they 
rarely get so caught up in the similarities to real life that they forget 
that the main goal of the game is to checkmate the other player.

Don't misconstrue my point, though. I'm *not* arguing that the only point 
of Agora is to win -- not at all. Even in chess there are other goals - 
mental improvement, fun, etc., and again, those other goals are even more 
present in Agora. I'm just saying that the overwhelming focus on 
mirroring real-life situations and concepts within the world of Agora 
Nomic is, in my opinion, a constricting factor rather than a beneficial 
one in the progress and "interestingness" of the game. Instead of trying 
to legislate and force "real-world" concepts into the game, where they 
rarely fit well, why don't we relax a little and try to develop some 
concepts uniquely fitted to Agora Nomic -- concepts, perhaps, with little 
real-world application? Just some thoughts.

I agree; However, I think Vlad's idea was just to let the system be 
self-enforcing: if a player violated some aspect of a contract with 
another player, few would be willing to barter with the violator for some 
time after. I do think a system of contract law would be better, though.

An addendum to my directly previous message re: contract law:

But don't forget about 'Oaths,' and how they were held to be incapable of 
binding a Player. So be careful in writing the contract laws...

I can send Chris my D.N.Phil Thesis if he wants to read it. It is
entitled 'Breaking the Rules' and is concerned with the general
question of how various games cope with the situation in which the
rules have been broken.

*ahem* <embarrassed shuffling>

There is not, as such, a Welcome Wagon. That is to say, there is
not a file which I kept on hand ready to send to new Players.
On occasion, however, when I remembered, I would create ex nihilo
a message meeting the description of the Welcome Wagon when a
new Player registered.

Thank you, Steve, I just read it earlier today on the theses web page. 
Great job, by the way -- it cleared up for me what was probably the 
single point that has most disturbed me about Nomic since I've been 
playing.

It is listed on that page as having earned you your B.N., though. Also, 
what was your creative work for the D.N.Phil? Thanks..

Swann, I really enjoyed rereading this. It's still good journalism,
a year after you wrote it and two years after the events it describes.
Well done.

Have you forwarded it to Peter Suber? I think he might be interested.

I should have been clearer. Although there certainly merit in having
the above CFJ decided, the 'position' I was referring to was the one
that the Rules are not generally prohibited from actiung retroactively,
only rule changes. But that might be a little trickier to phrase...

What, even if there were a Rule stating that messages containing
descriptive sentences in terms of someone gaining something are
legally deemed to be orders to pay? Surely you cannot be claiming
that the position I am defending (and Scott too, it appears), is
conceptually impossible?

Assuming this Judgement survives Appeal (and why not?), what then?
No VTs, no automatic ratification of currency reports since R1687
was repealed, so no valid votes for the last god knows how long...

Is that a crisis I see coming over the crest of that hill, whistling
a merry tune? Or do the PC Rules provide a way out of this?

Firstly, long established game custom. We accepted self-repealing and
self-amending Rules as legally effective basically from day 1. In
the second place, we have enshrined in our Ruleset the distinction 
between Proposals and Rule Changes, so there's no reason to think
that in Agora, Rule Changes can only take effect as the result of
the adoption of Proposals.

Nah, non-proposed Rule Changes are too much fun! Hasn't it been
a fun week with the Virus?

What we really ought to do is pass a Rule which explicitly states
that we don't have to worry about infinitesimal amounts of time
when thinking about continuity. Although exactly how to phrase that
is a bit tricky, I'll grant.

Oh, I must have gotten confused. My D.N.Phil Thesis must have been
my essay 'Precedence, Protection and Mutability' (I think that was the
title). I have it lying around somewhere...I'll send it you.

I think I should redraft my recent essay on the concept of a 'rule change'
in Suber's Initial Ruleset (to take into account Michael's objections),
and submit that as a Thesis, too. Can I get a second D.N.Phil?

I think Vlad's intent is to directly legislate the power to trade
votes; then if I trade my voting right to Steve, Steve actually casts
my vote as well as his own.  This requires legislative modifications
to the Voting rules.

I would, instead, allow Steve and I to enter into a contract whereby I
agree to cast my vote in a specified way, and Steve agrees to do
something else.  If either of us feels that the other has failed to
comply, the Courts can determine if the contract has been breached and
determine a just compensation for the other for the failure to
perform.

Note that in what I believe Vlad is suggesting, it is not possible to
breach a deal, because the deal takes place "automatically", whether
you want it to or not.

Oaths were a very lame attempt at contract law.

To me all this talk of an economy is just a coded way of discussing
game design. We'll have succeeded in creating a successful economy,
in my opinion, when Players are regularly faced with interesting
strategic decisions about how to use the resources they have, and
about how they should go about obtaining more of them. This kind
of thinking is a feature of all the games I enjoy playing. Even
chess fits the model - it's just that in chess the resources are
quite abstract things like 'counterplay', 'attacking chances', 'good
pawn structure', 'bishop vs knight in an open position', etc.

Since I'm particularly interested in games of negotiation, naturally
I want to see those aspects of Agora accentuated. So I'm for real VT
scarcity, since I think it will force Players to negotiate about
voting. I think Oerjan is right on the money about P-Notes: what are
they for? I'm less enthusiastic about Indulgences than seems to be the
prevailing mood: despite the fair amount of trade in them of late, I
don't really understand what they're for, either. I'd be in favour
of denying Players with Blots the right to vote. That'd really
sharpen things up around here!

I don't think there's any Rule that I can't go ahead and post this before 
the CotC does so officially:

CFJ 943.
Judgement: FALSE

Reasons:

The major problem in this situation is that the concept of payment 
orders, blots, and penalties are incredibly poorly defined in relation to 
each other.

First of all, we have R1435, which tells us that a P.O. for 1 Indulgence 
with a payee as the Bank is called a Blot. It then tells us that when a 
Rule states that a Player is to gain some number of Blots, a P.O. shall 
be executed with that Player as the payor, the Bank as the payee, and for 
a # of indulgences equal to the # of Blots the Player is to receive.

Thus, we have now implicitly recognized the concept of "gaining" a 
payment order, since a PO for 1 Ind. to the Bank = a Blot. This is 
incredibly unclear wording. So once the Blotee has "gained" a payment 
order, someone else is required to "execute" a payment order. Are these 
P.O.'s the same? It's quite unclear. But, and the next paragraph of the 
rule gives some support for this, I'm going to assume that this is just 
poor phrasing.

So now someone is required to 'execute' the payment order. In this case, 
it was the CotC, under R408. A P.O. is "executed" by posting it to the 
Public Forum. So again, we have a point of confusion. Is a P.O. a 
message, or a string of text? Those things can be posted to the Public 
Forum. On the other hand, if that were the case, then any message in the 
correct form would be a P.O., and if it were specifically in the correct 
form under R1435, it would be a Blot. This is still a Blot, regardless of 
whether it has been 'executed.' So then, for example, I have a # of Blots 
= to the # of messages in that form that I have? Well, have where? In my 
mailbox? In some platonic mailbox? But then again, R1435 says a Player 
'may be said' to have a # of Blots = to something else entirely. Thus, a 
contradiction. Now, I'm not saying that this interpretation of a Blot as 
a message is correct, merely that is is highly unclear and ambiguous in 
the Rules.

R1596 never says that the *only* way a P.O. can be executed is for a 
player with the authority to post it to the Public Forum. Thus, except 
for one small point, I would be inclined to judge that R408, by assigning 
a penalty of 3 Blots to a crime, implicitly executes a P.O. for that 
amount. The problem, though (among many others I'm sure will be brought 
up over that point), is that a Blot "is to be executed by whomever is 
required to report the change in Blots." Thus, the CotC. So, as amazingly 
unclear as the situation is, it does appear that the CotC was required to 
'execute' the Blot/P.O.'s by 'post[ing] the Order to the Public Forum.'

So did he? *Yes.*

Why do I have a feeling this is going to be appealed? Anyway, here's why.

Here's what the CotC said: "Blob commits the Infraction of Failing to 
Judge, an action which bears the penalty of 3 Blots."

A Blot has been defined in the rules. Thus, this sentence is equivalent 
to:

Blob commits...an action which bears the penalty of 3 Payment Orders for 
1 Indulgence, the payees of which are the Bank. In my opinion, this 
"specifies exactly one source entity, exactly one destination entity, 
exactly one Currency, and a number of units of that Currency which is a 
positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ." 

The syntax and meaning of a 'penalty' makes it clear that Blob is the 
source entity, and the rest is clear.

The message concerning Elde was phrased identically. elJefe's was phrased 
differently:

"elJefe receives 3 Blots committing the Infraction of Failing to Judge."

So elJefe receives 3 P.O.'s? This syntax would seem to indicate that 
elJefe is the pay*ee* of this transaction! But the Bank is already 
defined as the payee, by the definition of a Blot. So this does *not* 
specify exactly one source entity and one destination entity. Thus, the 
CotC *did* fail to execute the required P.O. for the 3rd infraction. 
However, as the statement of the CFJ alleges that the CotC failed in all 
*3* cases, it must be judged FALSE.

A possible objection would be that R1435 specifies what it means to 'gain 
some # of Blots.' That is quite true -- it means that a P.O. shall be 
executed. But the P.O. was *not* executed, as R1435 does not mention 
anything about *messages* stating that players gain Blots, only about 
*Rules* which so state.

So my judgement is FALSE, CFJ 940 be damned. I have "considered game 
custom, commonsense, past Judgements, and the best interests of the game 
before applying other standards." I personally think CFJ 940 was judged 
incorrectly; however, that is irrelevant here. I'm under no obligation to 
abide by past incorrect judgements. :) What a welcome back to Agora!

Okay. At the moment, I still have seven Blots. Now, I certainly 
don't want to become Lawless. And so, I make the following 
offer, in order to get some of those damn Indulgences:

To anyone who transfers me an Indulgence, I will, at any time 
in the future, vote in any manner you request, on *any* one 
proposal not proposed by me which you name. 

For those uninterested in this, other offers are also 
possible. E-mail me.

Part of the problem with that is that coming up with truly interesting 
"new" ideas is, well, hard. "Real-world" ideas are there for the taking 
and adapting. Truly innovative ideas are hard to come by. Which is not to
say that they aren't there, of course, just that they're not something you
can produce just by saying, "Well, let's come up with some *new* ideas!"

"real-world" ideas into the game, then maybe some other, original, ideas 
will develop.
