I am of the mind that whether an act has a given legal effect is
determined at the time that act takes place, according to the Rules in
force at that time.  Rule 101 says as much.  I interpret Rule 108 to
say that no Rule Change has effect prior to its effectuation; that is,
the adoption of a Rule Change has no effect on the law, and therefore
the legal effect of any act, prior to its adoption.  (I'm not sure
that Rule 108's retroactivity clause actually adds anything to Rule
101; discussion on this point welcome.)  

I do NOT believe that Rule 108 would prohibit a Rule that operates so
as to cancel, reverse, or modify the legal effect of an act which
occurred prior to that Rule's enactment (or amendment), but I believe
that, generally, such operation must be explicitly specified (the
default is to let prior legal effects stand).

Applying this general theory to the situation of casting Votes, I
analyze the problem as follows: The act is that of transmitting a
message to the Assessor which purports to contain Votes.  The legal
effect of this act is determined in light of the attendant
circumstances which are extant at the moment the message is
transmitted.  In order to determine whether a purported Vote is
legally cast by that message, the Assessor (and, subsequently, if
called upon to do so, a Judge) must examine (among other factors)
whether the message was sent during the designated Voting Period of
that Proposal.  I would argue that the Voting Period of a Proposal is
computed _de novo_ every time a Voting Message is sent, according to
the law then extant, not once when the Proposal is distributed.

Exploring this conclusion, we see that extending the Voting Period
generically may cause the Voting Period of prior Proposals to be
reopened.  Does this create a problem?  Yes, but not a deadly one.

Suppose that we amended Rule 693 to state that the Voting Period of
all Proposals is 10 years, beginning at the time the Proposal was
distributed.  Under the theory that I have now espoused, this would
mean that every Proposal ever made in Agora would be again open for
Voting.  However, the prior determinations that these Proposals had
been adopted (for those that were adopted) would have been legal
because they were legally adopted under the law then in force; thus,
there would be no need for (and in fact no legal justification for)
recission of those results.  This could lead to the curious result of
a single Proposal being adopted twice (or in fact many times, given
multiple extensions of the voting period).  I am not particularly
bothered by this; it might be messy, and horribly inconvenient (not to
mention running into all sorts of recordkeeping problems), but I see
no legal inconsistency at all.

Suppose that, instead, we shorten the Voting Period from its present
value of seven days to six hours.  This would, of course, have no
effect on those Proposals which were distributed more than seven days
previously; the change would have no effect on the legal ability of
anyone to cast Votes on those Proposals.  (It might, however, create a
rather difficult situation for the Assessor; he would have a very
limited amount of time to report the results of those Proposals
without violating ASAP requirements, since the rule change would push
back the moment that triggered the ASAP duty by 6.5 days.)  Proposals
distributed more than six hours prior, but less than seven days prior,
would have their effective voting periods chopped off at the moment
of adoption.

The situation discussed in CFJ 944 is yet another odd one; in this
case Proposals distributed during a given time period had no statutory
Voting Period at all, making it impossible to cast a legal vote upon
those Proposals for a portion of the period which later became the
statutory Voting Period of those Proposals.  In this case, the
effective voting period was truncated at the front end, instead of the
rear.  Consider also the effect on existing Proposals of amending Rule
693 to state that the Voting Period of a Proposal begins seven days
after that Proposal is distributed.  

Effective voting period (the actual period during which one can
legally cast a vote upon a given Proposal) need not equal statutory
voting period, which I believe is the crux of the issue here.  I
believe I have demonstrated that the effective voting period of a
Proposal can be of nearly any length, and need not even be a single
contiguous interval of time.  While this theory can lead to messy and
sometimes unintuitive results, it does not (as far as I can tell)
engender contradiction.

Curiously, none of this has anything to do with CFJ 1111, and Steve
has no excuse but to Judge TRUE.  Proposals 3810-3812 were distributed
Mon, 30 Nov 1998 18:29:29 +1100 (EST).  CFJ 1111 was called Mon, 14
Dec 1998 11:49:26 +1100, almost 14 days later.  It is obvious that the
Rules at the time that CFJ 1111 was called designated that the Voting
Period of these Proposals ended at Mon, 7 Dec 1998 18:29:29 +1100,
which preceded the date that CFJ 1111 was called; thus, its statement
is obviously true.

I don't see the inconsistency.  The real problem is that we really
don't care what the Voting Period of a Proposal is, except for the
purpose of determining whether a message purporting to contain Votes
has the effect of casting Votes (and for a few other sundry purpose,
the analysis of which is quite similar) and for determining the time
by which the Assessor is required to announce the results of Voting.

Steve> We can say, for example, that although we would have said a

This flies in the face of Rule 101.  Whether an act is legal or
illegal is determined based on the law in force at the time the act
took place, not the law which exists at any other time.  We might say
that the act in question "would be" illegal under the present law, but
"was not illegal" under the law then in force.  Saying that the act
"is" illegal is plain wrong; the subjunctive voice must be used to
indicate that the statement is a contrafactual hypothetical.

If by "description" you mean "legal effect", and by "event" you mean
"act", my opinion is we cannot, in the present, change the description
of any past event whatsoever, but we can attach new meaning to past
events if we so elect.

Rule 108 prevents rewriting the past and then saying "there, the past is now
this different thing, so by Rule 101 we should have respected that different
thing at that time".

Unless you believe that an event doesn't occur at a given time unless it's
defined as such *at that time*, i.e.

  (A) E occurs at time T
        <->
  (B) at time T, E is defined as occurring at time T

If E is "the end of the Voting Periods of Proposals 3810-3812", then there
has not yet been a T for which (B) holds.

An attempt at a formal expression of the retroactivity prohibition,
and why it's needed : given a description of the game state at time
T1, and the specification of a time T2, and a full account of all
events occurring in the intervening period, we should be able to
accurately reconstruct the game state at time T2, without requiring
any knowledge of events occuring before T1 or after T2.

Let's open up one more avenue of discussion - I submit that what
matters is the legal status of Votes *at the time the Assessor counts
them*. We really don't care whether a Vote is legal or not at the
moment it is cast. Thus, a Rule Change can affect the legality of
Votes that were cast previous to that RC, as long as a Report from
the Assessor has not already - and permanently - caused Proposals
to fail or pass.

Rule 955/4 (Power=3)
Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal

      When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the
      uncancelled votes which have been legally cast shall be counted
      by the Assessor. [...]

As I see it, Blob's enumeration of the admissible hypotheses is
incomplete, and the very existence of CFJ 1111 attests to that. ;)
For completeness, they are as follows, and in no particular order,
with D (Mon, 30 Nov 1998 at 07:29:29) being the time of distribution;

a- the VP ended at D + 10 days, due to R639/3
b- the VP ended at D + 7 days, due to R639/4
c- the VP ended at the time P3809 took effect
d- the VP ended at some other time
e- the VP never ended

Now, d) seems quite unlikely. The only Rules that have an effect of
any sort on Voting Periods are R639, R1724 and R1726. In the absence
of any evidence that a Guillotine Application was executed, we can
safely conclude that it is ruled out.

Hypothesis e) is conceivable under the interpretation that "the end
of the Voting Period" is an 'event', that is, a change in some
entity's attributes occurring at a given point in time. This would
imply that Rule 639 operates by 'setting' the a Proposal to into a
certain 'state' at the time it is distributed, then 'setting' a different
'state' when the prescribed period has elapsed. Since the moment
specified, under that view, by 639/4 for 'closing' the VP of the 
relevant Proposals happened before 639/4 became law, that 'event'
did not - and now cannot - happen.

Hypothesis a) implies that the Voting Period is an 'attribute' of a 
given Proposal, and, once granted to that Proposal, can only be
changed via the operation of some Rule, under R1011. In other
words, as soon as a Proposal is distributed, it has a 'timer clock' 
attached to it that will ring some specified time later, and R639
only operates by setting the dials on the timer, so to speak.

Hypotheses b) and c) imply that Voting Periods are not exactly
attributes, but more of a legal designation pertaining to acts that
may be legal or not depending on whether they were performed during
or outside of such periods. Thus, R639/4 states that Votes cast
between the time D a Proposal is Distributed and 7 days later are
legal, and others are not, whereas R639/3 stated that Votes cast
between D and 10 days later were legal. The 'end of the VP' under
that view is something of a fiction - the term refers to something
with event-like properties. It can definitely be said that after
P3809 took effect, the VP in question had ended, but from a stricter
point of view, the end of the VP as described by the Rules was the
earlier time.

This distinction would matter more for the purpose of determining
ASAP violations; if the difference between the two times had been
longer than a week, then under some bizzarre circumstances the
Assessor could have become technically guilty of Tardiness without
being able to do anything about it.

Now, my opinion, given the wordings of R639, R1724 and R1726, is that
the 'legal designation' model is the one that least stands in the way
of a consistent interpretation of all three Rules. As a consequence, 
I am inclined to Rule the Statement TRUE.

I welcome comments and critique.

I disagree, although I think the argument is close.  Rule 683 states
that a "Voting Entity votes ... _when_, during the Voting Period of
that Proposal, e informs the Assessor of the vote or votes e is
casting ...".  To me, this clearly indicates that a message purporting
to contain Votes has the legal effect of Voting _at the time it is
sent_.

Assessor's Reports do not cause Proposals to pass or fail; they merely
report whether they have passed or failed.  An intervening Rule Change
(or other action) could affect what legally cast Votes the Assessor is
required to count, but that is a different matter.

In one sense Assessor's Reports do something similar - remember that
a Proposal only takes effect, if it has been Adopted, when the Report
is sent, or if you want to pick nits, "at the time date-stamped on"
the Report.

Now, R106 says a Proposal is Adopted "if [...] it receives the
required number of votes". The Rule which defines "the required
number of votes" is R955, and it says that at the end of the VP "the
uncancelled votes which have been legally cast shall be counted by
the Assessor".

That is indeed clear... in all situations except those when the
Voting Period of a Proposal varies. That is precisely when, under
the view that the VP is merely the designation by the Rules of an
interval of time such that messages purporting to contain Votes and
which were sent during that period should be counted as legally cast
on the relevant Proposal, the meaning of R683 is debatable. Does that
Rule grant to such messages the status of 'legal votes' once and 
irrevocably at the time they are sent, or does it, as it were, only
come into play when the Assessor gets around to counting Votes...

This is the key question, of course; I believe that the language in
Rule 955, requiring the Assessor to count all votes which have been
legally cast, considered along with Game Custom, means that e must
count all those votes that were legal when they were cast.  Otherwise,
for example, e could not count votes cast by Players who, subsequent
to voting but before the end of the Voting Period, deregister or go On
Hold.  Game custom is clearly contrary to this position.

That has nothing to do (in a causal sense) with the Proposal being
adopted, however; it has to do with the provisions of the Proposal
taking effect.  

Consider: in Indiana a bill becomes a law when it has been passed by a
majority of both houses of the Assembly and signed by the Governor
(or, left unsigned by the Governor for a certain period of time, or
vetoed by the Governor and that veto overridden by a majority vote of
both houses), but that law does not take effect until July 1 of the
legislative year in which it was adopted (unless the bill declares
that there is an emergency and specifies a different date when it is
to take effect).

I don't see where Rule 116 says anything about things having to be done
within a week. Rather the opposite - if 116 would apply, it would say that
whatever it applies to is unregulated - and having to do it within one week
is clearly a regulation.

Huh?  I think you are confusing this either with someone else or with my
vote on 3815.  Unless someone convinces me there is a scam, I plan to vote
FOR 3818.

No, that is definitely wrong - whatever are you thinking of?!  It is quite
clear that Rule 116 prohibits any form of time limit from having effect
unless regulated by other Rules.

I think it's reasonable to take the viewpoint that a Rule
that imposes a requirement has an implicit time limit.
After all, most games don't provide a time limit for
any action, permitted or required. The only question is
what is the maximim reasonable time limit. Here are some
options:

1) Before the heat death/closure of the universe.
2) Before the sun goes nova and vaporizes Earth.
3) Before death of the Officer in question.
4) Before Agora becomes defunct (ordering here is arbitrary).
5) Before the Rule requiring the action is repealed/amended.
6) Before the Officer leaves office.
7) Before a majority of the Players start complaining.
8) Within one week.
9) As soon as reasonably possible.

For the sticklers among you: Note that the absence of a specified
time limit, strictly speaking, could equally be interpreted as requiring
the action be performed instantaneously, immediately the requirement
is imposed, as well as imposing no time limit whatsoever.

In fact, it prevents scams of the Trombone type, where currently a
Power=1 Rule may create a Power=4 non-Rule instrument, which in turn
is capable of amending Power=3 Rules.

("Scams of the trombone type" is one of those wonderful phrases which
might never have arisen in any communication, ever, if not for Agora. :)

Why should a Rule such as "As soon as possible after this Rule takes
effect, Blob shall pay out to emself 10 VTs, if George Washington was
alive at any time during the year 1810, but bill emself 10 VTs if
Washington was not," be forbidden?  This is not retroactive, as
per CFJ 1 (note the annotation in R108), nor has anyone in the current
debate suggested that such a Rule should be forbidden, but it would
violate your criteria, as it requires knowledge of events of the
year 1810.

To me, it is the language of R683 and R693 themselves.  R693 says
that the voting period *is* such and such, which to me indicates
a designation.  R683 says that a player *votes* when e does such-and-such,
to me indicating an action.

You may speak of retrospectively changing the status of a vote to illegal,
but I believe that this is (partly) based on mistaking a common usage
of language for the Rules.

We may speak of an "illegal vote" and everyone knows what we mean.  But
the Rules recognize no such thing as an illegal vote.  A given action
is either voting legally, or not voting at all.  What we commonly call
an "illegal vote" is technically an attempt to vote which fails to do so.
It is not a vote at all.

Of course, then your argument simply makes a slight correction: whereas
previously you asked, "If we can retrospectively designate the voting
period, why can we not retrospectively designate the legality or
illegality of a vote?"  Now, instead, you ask "If we can retrospectively
designate the voting period, why can we not retrospectively designate
whether something is or is not a vote?"

The answer to that question lies also in R683, which states,

      Once cast, a
      vote cannot be changed or cancelled by the Voting Entity which
      cast it, although it may be cancelled as other Rules require.

We have no Rule here requiring the cancellation of a vote.

To answer the more general question, could the status of an action
as a vote or not a vote be changed without such a sentence as the
above, I would answer yes.  (This position is probably now closer to
the D/D model than to the D/E model.  Oh well.  "Do I contradict myself?
Very well then I contradict myself.  (I am large, I contain multitudes.)"
--Walt Whitman)

Anyway, you will object that this allows virtually anything to be
changed retrospectively.  This is true.  But this is no worse--and,
_de facto_, no different, than allowing virtually anything to be
"changed" via a legal fiction, something which you convinced me
was possible long ago.

That is to say, yes, it would be undesirable to say "Bob's vote on P643
is FOR, effective now," when he in fact voted AGAINST, but it is no more
or less undesirable than saying "Bob's vote on P643 shall be considered
to be FOR."  In our discussion of "considered" many moons ago, it was
you who convinced me that such a sentence would be fully effective.
