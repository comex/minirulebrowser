So scarcity is beginning to make its influence felt before it really
happens (Tabula Rasa)...

What this proto does is create a backdoor so we don't fell the
scarcity so much. Of course that's possible, but doesn't seem to be
the point to me.

Why not leave the pressure on? "Then minor bug fixes etc will never be
adopted", says Oerjan and stops his spring cleaning. But I'd like to
remind us that there are strategies to deal with scarcity that do not
rely on rule changes (which effectively abolish the scarcity again
before it begins to bite). 

Why not have a bit more wheeling and dealing connected to "minor",
uncontroversial proposals? For example, combining several of them in
one packet, until there are enough of them that they are worth the
three VTs they need (or until they begin to get controversial,
anyway...)? Oerjans spring cleaning certainly would produce such a
packet, and I'm not sure I'd just declare presence on it.

And still another tweak. Doesn't anyone make Stylish Proposals anymore?

I know, I know. But then, besides being useful nitpicks, my recent
proposals were mostly meant to fill the proposal queue - an empty or
half-empty queue is just as good (or bad) as none at all.

I don't think the fuss is about what it costs the proposer, but about
making it easy to get trivial but desireable proposals passed in spite of
Player reluctance to spend scarce votes.

This is a good point.  Attached is a revised Proto.

Proto: Real Disinterest

Amend Rule 1623 by appending the text:

      Any Player may cause a Disinterested Proposal to become
      Interested by posting a message to the Public Forum that
      unambiguously specifies which Proposal is to be made
      Interested, provided the message is sent no later than 48
      hours after the Proposal's distribution.

[Took Blob's suggestion to heart that all Players should agree if
a Proposal is really "trivial".  However, I made it a kind of
inverse "Without Objection" since this seems more natural to me.
Also limited the period of "objection" to give Players time to
assess the Proposal but not be able to force a transition at the
last minute.]

Amend Rule 955 by replacing the text:

                                                  and there were at
      least three votes in favor of the Proposal, then that Proposal
      is adopted.

with:

                                            and either there were at
      least three votes in favor of the Proposal or the Proposal was
      Disinterested, then that Proposal is adopted.

Amend Rule 947 by replacing the text:

      If a Proposal is adopted which

with:

      If an Interested Proposal is adopted which

Amend Rule 1786 by replacing the text:

      As soon as possible after a Proposal has been determined to
      have passed by the narrowest of margins,

with:

      As soon as possible after an Interested Proposal has been
      determined to have passed by the narrowest of margins,

[Comments:  Make sure Disinterested Proposals receive no rewards of any sort,
but make it possible to pass them with one vote.]
