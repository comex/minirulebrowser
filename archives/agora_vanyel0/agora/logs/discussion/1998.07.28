It would seem that ussenterprise.ufp.org is inserting a spurious period in
the From envelope of the below message before forwarding to servtech.com.
At least there is no such extra period anywhere in the copy of the same
message I received from the list (And since our mail server is pretty
nitpicking itself, it probably would have bounced it if there had been.)

I guess the reason why it doesn't happen everytime is that
ussenterprise.ufp.org is actually two machines, 209.12.7.40 and
209.12.7.193.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

I haven't read your post in detail, but these sentences lead me to
suggest that you misunderstand the situation.  The number of eligible
players (as I understood the situation) hadn't changed.  In particular
the eligibility list effectively changed from being 

A B C D Harlequin E F G H I

to being

A B C D E F G Macross H I

If you'd been the person in question, then you would have had just as
much chance of being selected because the dice roll and the size of
the list would still have been in sync.  The situation was not the
same as the usual mistake. 

Nonetheless, an easier resolution could have been obtained if I'd just
stuck with the original assignment and claimed that I would have
replaced Harlequin with Macross if he'd been selected the first time. 

Michael.

I don't believe your criticism of my reselection method for CFJ 1100
to be valid as you seem to think that I'd left someone off the list.
In fact, I had someone on the list who shouldn't have been there, and
someone else not on the list who should have ben.  I therefore don't
see the need to use that as an argument for a re-reselection.

I don't understand why you then want Judges to be recomputed for just
1100 and 1101.  In the light of CFJ1101, these selections were clearly
wrong, but so too were a whole heap of others, in particular, the CFJs
(other than 1100! :-) associated with Swann's Order coup, where a
bunch of Players requested ineligibility in a manner similar to the
way in which Harlequin and Antimatter did more recently. 

Michael.

Be it therefore resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      Any CFJ which alleges that a Crime has been committed and which
      was first called more than six months after the time the Crime
      was alleged to occured lacks proper standing.  Such a CFJ shall

I don't think that the assignment of CFJs to Judges was ever
"pragmatized", however.  (Probably should be, though.)

Why is that?  Swann could be mistaken in his admission.  Agoran Judges
do not rule on the pleading and accompanying evidence (as do real-life
common law judges), but on the actual truth of the matter at hand,
which is a much harder (and often impossible) task.

The trouble is not with Harlequin's address; the problem is that
gecko's sendmail is misconfigured.  Obviously, blizzard.servtech.com
has been configured to reject mail from invalid hosts (a good way to
block spam) and 'gecko.serc..rmit.edu.au' is an invalid host name.
The solution is to fix gecko.

That was the situation in CFJ 1100, when one Player was to be replaced
on the list by another, but not the situation in CFJ 1101, where (I
think) a Player was simply omitted from the list (Players, actually, for
Antimatter was also left off the list). 

But in any case my criticisms were more general; even in CFJ 1100, I
don't think the method you used secures a probability of 1/12 (or
whatever it should be) of Macross' being selected as Judge, and
therefore I don't think the selection was in accordance with R1079.

One last thing, then: aren't we weeks overdue for a Scorekeepor
Election?

The situation is quite complicated, with different factors affecting
Judge eligibility. But read my post again, and you'll find that I
distinguished between the cases of CFJ 1100 and 1101. Here is, I hope,
a clearer statement of where I stand on the various issues.

CFJ 1100:

I believe two different kinds of mistakes were made in the selection of
the Judge for this CFJ. Firstly, there is the mistake that Harlequin and
Antimatter were held to be ineligible, when Kolja's Judgement in CFJ
1101 shows that they were eligible. Secondly, and independently, your
method of reinserting Macross into the eligiblity list does not secure
the correct probability that Macross is selected as the Judge of the CFJ
(1/14 if Harlequin and Antimatter are eligible, 1/12 if they are not),
for we have no reason to think that the probability that Macross comes
nth in the list, given an original roll of n, is 1/P, where P is the
number of eligible Players. This could only be true if we could be
certain that there were an equal probability of Macross' occupying any
of the places on the list, and we have no reason to think that is so.
(Ask yourself this, for example: what is the probability that my name
would appear first on an alphabetically ordered list of 12 random names?
Whatever the answer is, I'm pretty sure that it's not 1/12, and very
sure that it's not equal to the probability that my name comes last.)

CFJ 1101:

Here we have only to worry about Kolja's Judgement, which shows that
Harlequin and Antimatter were eligible to Judge the CFJ. Of course,
reselecting the Judge, even using the standard method, runs the risk of
paradox, for if either Harlequin or Antimatter were selected and
returned a Judgement of FALSE, that Judgement would be self-undermining.
But that's a (now) unavoidable risk inherent in the situation. On the
other hand, a Judgement of TRUE would be self-reinforcing, and there's a
12/14 chance that the original selection of Kolja as Judge will stand
anyway.

My position on this is that those other CFJs are now far enough in the
past for the selection of the Judges for them, though erroneous, to have
become practically non-retractable errors. Therefore they should stand.
That reasonsing does not apply to CFJs 1100 and 1101.

But Judge selection has never been pragmatized.
