That's a statement I don't understand. P-notes have been around since
I first registered (not that this was soo long ago, but anyway).

>>
We're never going to have any kind of economy
around here if we are not willing to have to pay for things.

But we _do_ have a working economy already! Indulgences work, and so
do VTs, with the only problem being inflation (but fighting inflation
is not a problem connected with implementing an economy, but with
running one - we're already doing that!).

I'd like to post a few remarks I made in a private mail some time ago:

>> 
[..] Actually, I consider myself one of the proponents of a real
economy. But I'd like to see a _real_ one, where the currencies, and
dealing with them, make real sense and not just lots of red tape.

VTs are good in that sense, because they are needed to do something
which is vital in a nomic: vote. Indulgences also are good, because
blots prevent you from doing something else which is important for a
nomic: winning. If you collect too many of them, you can even be
deregistered. 

P-notes, however, are a matter of red tape only, at least at the
moment: What is really the effect of using them? Or what is bad about
not having them? Nothing.

You can make as many proposals as you like without ever paying a
P-note. You will even be listed as author of the resulting rule
changes. The only _real_ effect P-notes can possibly have is that you
incur persistent debt penalties if you have a negative amount of
them. Great. 

As soon as someone introduces a usage for P-notes that makes them as
relevant as VTs and indulgences, I'll wholeheartedly support their
reintroduction. But at the moment they don't serve any purpose
whatsoever, and I proposed their abolition not out of a specific
dislike for P-notes but simply because several players had noted
recently, and were right in doing so, that the Agora rule set is
getting longer and more complex all the time without gaining a
corresponding amount of play complexity or increased fun. So I
thought, why carry around a concept that is functionless at the moment,
just in the hope that someone, someday will invent a good use for it?
Once this someone has eir idea, we can always reintroduce P-notes in a
single proposal, and this proposal will certainly get my FOR-vote.
<<

Of course, abolishing disinterested proposals instead of P-notes might
be a way to make P-notes functional again. While I would prefer the
simplification of abolishing P-notes altogether, the abolition of
disinterested proposals might be enough.

We haven't seen any because of the hefty Petition Fee charges. I gaze
into my crystal ball and predict that if Steve's proto were adopted
as it stands, we'd see quite a few Proposal Scams in a very short
time.

One of the things that gives value to indulgences is the risk of being
deregistered for lawlessness. However, in typical Agora manner (I hope
I'm not hurting anyone's feelings here) at the moment we are
collectively ignoring this.

Kinda reminds me of the way we played Monopoly as kids: we couldn't
bear seeing each other going bancrupt, so we kept bailing each other
out with donations and loans. Later we realized that this wasn't
really the point of the game, so we made a "house rule" that
prohibited all donations and loans between players. Instead we allowed
players to borrow from the bank...

Of course, _real_ Monopoly it still wasn't; and I'm not arguing that
we should deregister anyone for lawlessness now (at least, that seems
to be the quiet consensus), but I don't like the present situation,
either, and would like to suggest the following amnesty proto:

##
When this proposal is adopted, the chancellor shall pay out 30
indulgences to all players with 20 or more blots.
##

Is this legal? Working? Better than announcing the lawlessness of
players in public? And: how are we ever going to get an economy
running if we ignore its negative effects on individual players (not
only deregistration, as in this case, but also simple inability to act
due to lack of funds)?

I can tell you why *I* am ignoring it now - for one thing, I have a
34-Blot PO which I can't even pay off without having 34 Indulgences,
which is not likely to happen for some time yet, even with a lot of
horse trading with those Players who do have Indulgences to spare,
which I don't have too much time for at the moment. Remind me to
work on my proto to make partial fulfillment of POs possible.

Well, in addition to the above, it's not really much fun, I suppose, 
to go and deregister someone. Some other kind of penalty - say, that 
a Lawless Player could be indentured to a Player, who'd then become 
eir Executor, the indenture being sold in an open auction - that 
would be more interesting, for instance.

Also, and unfortunately, the Lawlessness penalty, due to the quirks
of the new Currency Rules, does not do much to correct a Lawless
Player's Blot situation. At the very least a Lawless Player should be 
absolved of most of eir Blots - I'd suggest all save one - after 
purging eir one-month forced deregistration sentence.

Come up with negative effects that make for more interesting game 
play.

Proto-Proposal : Indenture
---

Amend Rule 1714 to read :

   An Overdue Payment Order that is a number of Blots is that
   number of Overdue Blots.  A Lawless Player is a Player who has
   more than 30 Overdue Blots.

   Whenever a Player is Lawless and is eir own Executor, the Justiciar,
   or the Speaker if the Lawless Player holds the Office of Justiciar,
   shall conduct an Auction to Indenture that Player, as defined in
   other Rules. At the end of the Auction, the Herald shall vacate 
   all Blots of the Lawless Player and bill that Player for 5 
   Indulgences.

Enact a Rule, titled "Auctions", reading :

   Whenever the Rules call for an Auction to be held, the 
   Player responsible for holding the Auction shall announce that 
   fact to the Public Forum as soon as possible. For a period of one 
   Week after such an announcement is posted, all Players, 
   with the exception of any Players made ineligible by other Rules,
   may post Bids to the Public Forum.

   A Bid consists of a combination of Delayed Transfer Orders, naming 
   any number of Currencies, specifying the Bank as the destination, 
   submitted for the purpose of entering a Bid in one specific Auction,
   to be executed at end of the Auction period.

   A Bid is only valid if all amounts of Currencies named therein are 
   larger than the amounts named in all previous Bids, or if that Bid 
   names a Currency not named in any previous Bids. If one of the 
   Transfer Orders making up a Bid are cancelled, the entire Bid 
   thereby becomes invalid.

   If the Auction being held is designated by the Rules as an Open 
   Auction, only Bids sent to the Public Forum shall be valid.

   As soon as possible after the end of the Auction period, the 
   Player responsible for holding the Auction shall announce the 
   identity of the Player who posted the most recent valid Bid. That 
   Player shall be known as the Winner of the Auction, and any 
   effects of the Auction specified in the Rules shall take place at 
   the time of this announcement.

Enact a Rule, titled "Auction to Indenture", reading :

   Whenever the Rules call for an Auction to Indenture a Player, all 
   Active Players, with the exception of the Player whose Indenture 
   is being auctioned, shall be eligible.

   The Winner of the Auction shall become the Executor of the 
   Indentured Player for a period of one month.

Scam, introduces Auctions - a potentially useful mechanism in and of 
themselves - what more could you possibly want... ;) ]

So five minutes before the end of the Auction, one creates a new Currency,
and submits a bid for one of that Currency.  Oh yes, and just before the
end of the Auction, everyone who made losing bids cancels the delayed TOs.

You properly note that free Disinterest is the sole reason for the
lack of commerce in P-Notes.  It is quite evident (and, apparently,
evidently ignored) that Agorans are extremely spendthrifty, even to
the point of hoarding when spending would be more profitable in the
long run.

I'm not sure I understand your statement.  How are we failing to
recognize the negative effects on individual players of having a lack
of funds?

I like the idea.

Nitpicks:

>>
   A Bid consists of a combination of Delayed Transfer Orders, naming 
   any number of Currencies, specifying the Bank as the destination, 
   submitted for the purpose of entering a Bid in one specific Auction,
   to be executed at end of the Auction period.
<<

What happens if one of the recordkeepors involved rejects the delayed
TO?

And is it intentional that everyone must pay, even those who don#t win
the auction? That's not how auctions usually work, and will not
encourage bidders, I'm afraid (Scott is quite right with his remark
about our spendthriftiness).

The first objection is valid - the notion I wanted to express was
that you must top all previous Currency bids, or introduce a new
Currency to the largest set previously named. A correction :

   A Bid is only valid if all amounts of Currencies named therein are
   larger than the amounts named in all previous Bids, or if that Bid
   names a Currency not named in any previous Bids in addition to all 
   Currencies already named.

You can still top any bid by creating a custom Currency, though - I'm 
not sure what I should do about that. Maybe

   A Bid consists of a combination of Delayed Transfer Orders, naming
   any number of Currencies which existed at the time the Auction was
   initiated, specifying the Bank as the destination, submitted for the
   purpose of entering a Bid in one specific Auction, to be executed at
   end of the Auction period.

As to the second, it is corrected thus :

   At the end of the Auction period, the Transfer Orders making up 
   all valid Bids save the most recent one are cancelled. The Player 
   who made the most recent valid Bid becomes the Winner of the 
   Auction.

   As soon as possible after the end of the Auction period, the 
   Player responsible for holding the Auction shall announce the
   identity of the Winner of the Auction, and any effects
   of the Auction specified in the Rules shall take place at the time
   of this announcement.

At least, not so openly that someone doing that wouldn't be blamed 
for being a poor sport, which is a far more serious penalty. I do 
hope I'm still being at least a little annoying, though.

So it will have to be a rule, like:

##
create a new rule reading:

As soon as possible after the creation of this rule, the chancellor
shall pay out 30 indulgences to all players with 20 or more
blots. This rule automatically repeals itself as soon as all POs
issued due to this rule have been satisfied.

Would that work?

> What happens if one of the recordkeepors involved rejects the delayed

Oops, forgot about that. An updated proto follows.

Proto-Proposal : Indenture, v1.1
---

Amend Rule 1714 to read :

   An Overdue Payment Order that is a number of Blots is that
   number of Overdue Blots.  A Lawless Player is a Player who has more
   than 30 Overdue Blots.

   Whenever a Player is Lawless and is eir own Executor, the Justiciar,
   or the Speaker if the Lawless Player holds the Office of Justiciar,
   shall conduct an Open Auction to Indenture that Player, as defined in
   other Rules.

   At the end of the Auction, the Herald shall vacate all Blots of the
   Lawless Player and bill that Player for 5 Indulgences.

Enact a Rule, titled "Auctions", reading :

   Whenever the Rules call for an Auction to be held, the 
   Player responsible for holding the Auction shall announce that fact
   to the Public Forum as soon as possible. For a period of one Week
   after such an announcement is posted, all Players, with the
   exception of any Players made ineligible by other Rules, may post
   Bids to the Public Forum.

   As soon as possible after the end of the Auction period, the 
   Player responsible for holding the Auction shall announce the
   identity of the Winner of the Auction, and any effects
   of the Auction specified in the Rules shall take place at the time
   of this announcement.

Enact a Rule, titled "Bidding", reading :

   A Bid consists of a combination of Delayed Transfer Orders, naming
   any number of Currencies specifically defined by the Rules,
   specifying the Bank as the destination, submitted for the purpose of
   entering a Bid in one specific Auction, to be executed at end of the
   Auction period.

   A Bid is only valid if all amounts of Currencies named therein are
   larger than the amounts named in all previous Bids, or if that Bid
   names a Currency not named in any previous Bids in addition to all
   Currencies already named.

   If one of the Transfer Orders making up a Bid are cancelled, the
   entire Bid thereby becomes invalid. Recordkeepors are not allowed 
   to reject a Transfer Order that is part of the Bid solely on the 
   grounds that it is a Delayed Transfer Order, any Rule to the 
   contrary not withstanding.

   At the end of the Auction period, the Transfer Orders making up all
   valid Bids save the most recent one are cancelled. The Player who
   made the most recent valid Bid becomes the Winner of the Auction.

   If the Auction being held is designated by the Rules as an Open
   Auction, only Bids sent to the Public Forum shall be valid.

Enact a Rule, titled "Auction to Indenture", reading :

   Whenever the Rules call for an Auction to Indenture a Player, all
   Active Players, with the exception of the Player whose Indenture is
   being auctioned, shall be eligible.

   The Winner of the Auction shall become the Executor of the 
   Indentured Player for a period of one month.

---

[Makes Lawlessness more fun, brings back echoes of the great Zombie
Scam, introduces Auctions - a potentially useful mechanism in and of
themselves - what more could you possibly want... ;) ]

[v1.1 changes - clarified rule for topping previous bids, prohibited
custom Currencies, only the Winner pays.]

Regarding auctions, instead of using the clunky Delayed Transfer
Orders (which, if you've read the Omnibus Reform Act of 1998, I plan
to repeal), I would suggest the following:

Bidder made bids merely by communicating them to the auctioneer.  At
the end of the auction, the bids are ranked, and the highest bidder is
entitled to acquire the property by transferring the bidded amount to
the seller.  If e fails to do so within seven days, or before that
time withdraws eir interest, the next highest bidder is entitled to do
so, and so on.  If all bidders fail to pay or withdraw, the property
remains in the possession of the seller.  Title vests upon payment,
not upon completion of the auction.

This, I think, is a more reasonable approach.

I think that the format of the proposals produced by the
Repeal-O-Matic, 1753, is too brief. To improve readability of these
proposals I would like to propose the following amendment:

Amend the paragraph of 1753 now reading

      For each Rule picked by the Promotor, the Repeal-O-Matic Rule
      shall submit a Proposal that consists of the following quoted
      text, with substitutions mandated by this Rule:

          "PROPOSAL: Repeal Rule [Number]
                     This Proposal shall have an AI = [Power]
                     Rule [Number] is hereby Repealed."

      Where [Number] in the quoted text is replaced by the Rule Number
      of the Rule picked by the Promotor, and [Power] is replaced by
      the Power of that same Rule.

to read instead

      For each Rule picked by the Promotor, the Repeal-O-Matic Rule
      shall submit a Proposal that consists of the following quoted
      text, with substitutions mandated by this Rule:

          "PROPOSAL: Repeal Rule [Number]
                     This Proposal shall have an AI = [Power]
                     Rule [Number] ([Title]) is hereby Repealed."

      Where [Number] in the quoted text is replaced by the Rule Number
      of the Rule picked by the Promotor, [Power] is replaced by the
      Power of that same Rule, and [Title] is replaced by the Title
      of that same Rule. At eir discretion, the promotor may also 
      append the text of that same rule to the proposal, marked as
      an informational attachment.

This is good.  However, it might be even better to just allow the Promotor to
attach any comments e sees fit, rather than forcing it to be the text of the
Rule.  Of course, you would probably want to specify that the comments in this
case can have no legal effects.  8)

I'm afraid it might not be.  For instance, the Promotor might add a comment
with potentially legal consequences and *not* mark it as informational only. 
If the proposal passed, then the consequences could be effective, even though
the Promotor broke the Rule when e specified them.

I'm not too concerned.  If the Promotor does this, we vote the
Proposal up or down on its merits, and prosecute the Promotor for
misconduct.

How about putting the title of the rule being repealed into the title of the 
proposal, since that's usually all that's quoted?

If you use this form, the obvious strategy is for everyone to create their own 
custom Currency, mint some, and not give any out.  Then, when an auction 
starts, it's a race to see who can get the first message sent, bidding 1 unit 
of their own personal currency.  All other bids after the first one are 
invalid, since no one else has any of that currency to bid.  Not much of an 
auction.

Or, is the idea that people should submit bids using currencies that they 
don't actually possess?

Morendil's approach was an attempt to deal with the fact that it's not
clear which is "more", 1 VT or 1 Indulgence.  Clearly, an ordering
relation will be needed that can deal with this; Morendil's was
inadequate (since it was a partial ordering, and we need a total
ordering).  However, the ordering can be subjective, especially when
there is a selling entity.

Well, repealing R833 is certainly something we could do, but there'd
be a temptation to replace it with something similar, since the
concept of rewarding Players for making Proposals that succeed (and
perhaps penalizing them for making Proposals that fail) is basically
a good one. The real problems with R833 are firstly that it gives its
rewards in P-Notes, and is in fact virtually the sole source of
P-Notes in the economy, resulting in a circular situation in which
one spends P-Notes only to get P-Notes back again, and secondly that
the amount of the award, F-A, is absurdly profligate.  

So what I would suggest is an amendment, which I'll write up later
today, awarding Players 2 VTs for each week in which they get a
Proposal passed.

Hefty? Have you noticed how many P-Notes there are in circulation
lately? Believe me, if I had a reason to make a Sane or Emergency
Proposal, the Petition Fee would not be an obstacle. At any rate,
I have no plans to propose my proto, since I've decided to support
Blob's rescue package for P-Notes, once it's in an acceptable form.

Suspension of voting privileges is a simpler alternative.

It's a move I favor, because it follows the same line of reasoning
that led us to get rid of free voting. Voting and making Proposals
are the two key activities in pretty much any game of Nomic, and it
makes sense to me that we are moving toward a situation in which
each of these activities will have with a concretized Currency to
represent it, and neither of the activities are free.

I remind the Clerk that Morendil's insistence is sufficient to initiate

I'd like that. "Repeal Rule 1494 (Welcome Wagon)" is much more
informative as a Proposal Title than "Repeal Rule 1494".

[Comment: here's a form of R833 I'd be happy with. Blob, if you like

into your proto.]

Be it hereby resolved that the Title of Rule 833 be changed to "Rewards
for Passing Proposals" and that it be amended to read:

      As soon as possible after the beginning of the Nomic Week,
      the Assessor shall pay out two Voting Tokens to each Player
      who submitted a Proposal which was adopted during the previous
      Week.

Is the timing of that OK, Scott?

I think a "good faith" clause would be the best compromise:  If you
reasonably believe you have the authority to Order something, you do, but
you cannot misuse the system if you know (or have strong doubts) that you
aren't authorized.

I understand this Proposal to be intended to accompany the ongoing reform
to make every game state change be triggered by a Player action, which
would basically settle this issue.

I think a corresponding Amendment of Rule 1011 to that effect would be a
good idea.

Joule in the MKS (or SI) system; erg in the CGS system.  Ergs sounds
better than joule to me, though. :)

I do seem to remember something of the sort, now that you mention it.
But I'm sure the circumstances would have been very different then.

Wasn't there a CFJ recently which dealt with these matters? Can anyone
dig it up?

At any rate, matters are (yet) more complicated than Crito has noticed.
R1435 states that:

      When a Rule states that a Player is to gain some number of
      Blots, a Payment Order shall be executed with that Player as
      the payor, the Bank as the payee, and for a number of
      Indulgences equal to the number of Blots that Player is to
      receive.  This order is to be executed by whomever is required
      to report the change in Blots.

Which, in this case, would be me, not the Clerk. In any case, I note that
R1504 applies to Crimes and Infractions, whereas Morendil has committed
neither a Crime nor an Infraction, but rather has been convicted of violating
a Rule (which conviction is now the subject of an Appeal). So I don't think
R1504 applies.

Since the Judgement has been appealed, I'll hold off on making the PO
for Indulgences until the Appeal is settled, unless the timing rules
require me to act sooner. Do they?

The difference in treatment derives from a difference in wording.
The late R1749 (recall that the number was not what we believed it
to have been), or perhaps we should say the new R1764 (hooray!) states
that the casting of any votes may only be achieved by sending a message
to the Public Forum. This clearly makes it impossible to vote without
sending a message to the PF. R1729, however, does not say that voting
may only be achieved by sending a message to the Assessor. It says that
Players shall not vote in public. R1729 imposes a restriction on
Players which Players may break, like the Electioneering Rules, or
the Secrecy Rules. R1764 does not impose a restriction on Players in
the same sense.
