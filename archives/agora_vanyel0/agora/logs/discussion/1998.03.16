Where does R955 say that no other Rule may set Voting Indices?

R955 sets the Voting Index of a Proposal under certain conditions.
(Namely, when the VP on a Proposal ends and the Assessor counts
the votes cast.)  It does not prevent other Rules from setting a Voting Index
under other conditions.  (A loophole which will be closed by Part II.)

I disagree--as I see it, R107 sets necessary conditions for
the effectiveness of proposed Rule Changes, but not sufficient
conditions.  Just because the other Rule Changes in P3710 were
distributed accurately, and thus satisfy R107, does not mean
that they are effective--only that R107 does not prohibit
them from being effective.

I believe that the reason that politics is an inevitable and central 
part of Agora is that it is an inevitable and central part of any 
activity involving more than a very few people.

It seems to me that the Proposal as distributed differs substantially 
from the Proposal as written; in particular, the discrepancy is such 
that the text of at least one Rule differs substantially between the 
two versions of the Ruleset that would result from applying the 
provisions of either version.

I would tend to think that a Proposal is either distributed or not, 
but that one cannot consider 'parts of' a Proposal to have been 
distributed when other parts have not.

If your argument is correct, it would mean that Promotor Blob can at 
this time post a corrected version of 3710, and a separate VP would 
as a result begin for the mangled part only.

Actually, 'Encourage VT spending' would make the above redundant.

And almost every Proposal would _still_ give Zeitgeist awards - forcing
people to use more FOR Votes doesn't mean people will be more inclined to 
vote AGAINST.
<<

IIRC, there is a small, but significant difference between my
Zeitgeist proposal and Steve's 'Encourage VT spending': Steve requires
three more FOR-votes than AGAINST votes (but these may come from one
voting entity), while I require three distinct voting entities to vote
for the proposal.

While three is not a large number of voters, in my proposal you cannot
get a Zeitgeist title if you are the only one who voted on your
proposal. But you can get it adopted.

Don't forget Rule 594's severability provision.  To me this means that
a defective provision can be severed from the remainder of the
Proposal, including for the purpose of Rule 107 analysis.  And of
course you are quite right in noting that Rule 107 speaks to Rule
Changes, not Proposals.

Hi Ørjan,

	Thankyou for letting us know.

	We recently changed things in this area.  It may be that they are
taking longer than expected to propagate around the world.

	Everything is working here, and I hope that by now everything is
working for you too.

	If not please let me know again.

	Thanks

Keith

Only when such activities are likely to give rise to conflicting
desires. Thus, politics need not be an inevitable and central part
of how a chamber orchestra plays a particular piece of music on
a particular occasion. Of course, politics could play a role in this
activity anyway ("Oh listen to Wojtek showing off on the violin again!
Well, I'll show him...")

It turns out that the DNS record was false alarm.  Not noticing that
silas-mx is not itself in the silas domain, I was asking the wrong name
server! :-(

Which means I don't understand why Steve's mail bounced.  But he hasn't
complained any more, so it must have been fixed.  :-)

One performance, probably not. But more than one - well, not
everyone can be a soloist, for instance. Who gets to do that at the
next performance ? Common sense dictates the best violin player
should, but that isn't always the case; maybe the second best violin
player is related to the conductor, and recently had a tiff with the
best violin. You're always going to end up with 'politics' at some
level - by which I mean, the activity of collectively resolving, by
verbal or written communication, issues related to the management of
a collective activity.

This follows directly from the fact that, since we're not ants or
bees, any collective activity requires decisions to be taken -
people don't just 'do the right thing' without being told - and that
whenever such decisions are taken collectively - which is not always
the case, such as military chain of command - that will be achieved
via come form of communication.

I submit that in such instances, the decision making process will
rarely, if ever, solely take a rational assessment of whatever
situation requires a decision into account.

Well, exactly. You notice I chose my example quite carefully. :)

I think you are mistaken that R955 sets the Voting Index only under
certain conditions, namely when the VP ends and the Assessor counts
the votes, leaving it open for another to set the Voting Index under
other conditions. I read R955 as specifying the only conditions under
which a Proposal is assigned a Voting Index. This is true to the extent
that R955 simply defines what the Voting Index of a Proposal is. The
real clincher for this view comes at the end of the first paragraph of
the Rule, where it states that "*in all other cases*, the Voting
Index shall be the number of Votes in favor divided by the number of
Votes opposed" (emphasis added). I think it's clear that the Rule
created by CVSI if it adopted will conflict with R955, and lose that
precedence conflict.

But that remark is easy to turn on its head: what Rule *does* prohibit
them from being effective? Indeed, I can find no Rule which prevents
the mangled provision from taking effect to whatever extent the Rules
allow. There is a Proposal distributed the Promotor, numbered 3710,
which has been voted and adopted. Several Rules directly imply that
this collection of text is therefore effective (R376 for instance),
notwithstanding that it was not precisely the text submitted by the
Proposer.

Can anyone confirm that I submitted my Proposal 'Indelible Proposal voting'
to the Public Forum, and raised its Priority to 2? That's my impression,
but I may be mistaken.

Why did you bother making a Claim of Error when you were going to CFJ
it anyway? Any response the Assessor might make will be made superfluous
by the result of the CFJ.

Who has to respond to this, by the way? General Chaos, who published 
the allegedly erroneous Report, or myself, who am currently Assessor-
delegate?

Oops. Does that count as one FOR, or do I need to send in a new

I would not agree that Proposal 3710 has been distributed. To take 
this to a logical extreme, had Promotor Blob posted a message 
purporting to be a Proposal Distribution, and containing the text

Proposal 3710 ("TGOVSP", AI=1)
---
A Rule shall be enacted with the title "Pop goes the weasel" and the 
text "This Rule shall repeal itself".
---

would you then be prepared to argue that Proposal 3710 has been 
distributed ? If so, who is its Proposer ? Would you be prepared to 
argue that it is Swann, even though e would in this case not be 
responsible for authoring one word of that Proposal ?

The difference with the actual situation is merely one of degree.

I dunno for sure. I probably meant to force the Assessor into taking 
up a position on the issue, which might have set the tone for the 
Judicial debate to follow.

The Player required by the Rules to post the message that is making
the claim that is alleged to be in error, according to 1431. I think
that's Chaos.

Rule 1770 may be relevant :

Distributing Proposals

      Each week, the Promotor shall distribute a batch of Proposals.
      These are the only Proposals e is allowed to distribute that
      week.

      If there are five or fewer Proposals in the Proposal Queue
      having a Priority greater than zero, then the batch shall
      consist of all such Proposals.

     <...>

I would argue that this means that the Promotor may only distribute
Proposals that are in the Queue, and no others. If so, a collection
of text which has not been submitted as a Proposal to the Promotor 
and thus entered the Queue may not be distributed, and thus may not 
be voted upon.

Rule 116.

>There is a Proposal distributed the Promotor, numbered 3710,

What is your basis for that belief?

Rule 1483:

      A Proposal is created whenever a Proposing Entity delivers some
      collection of text to the Promotor with the clear indication
      that that text is intended to become a Proposal.

I also know of no other way for anything to become a Proposal.

The collection of text distributed by the Promotor as Proposal
3710 had never been delievered "to the Promotor with the clear
indication that the text is intended to become a Proposal."

Therefore, the text distributed by the Promotor as Proposal
3710 was not, in fact, a Proposal.
