That's not the case I'm worried about. Under your proto, if Morendil
votes publically FOR, then privately cancels his vote, or changes it
to a declaration of Presence, then the Assessor is permitted to list
Morendil as having voted FOR, even if e knows very well that this is
not currently Morendil's vote. Admittedly, this would almost certainly
be a violation of TIA, but that's a separate issue.

I would probably have admitted it, actually, since there appears to be
an unopposed consensus on the issue.

Please note, however, that I would be obliged to correct not only my
error with respect to Proposals 3601 through 3613, but also with
respect to Proposals 3534 through 3554, some of which may have
passed.  It is not difficult for me to do this (I could produce the
report in a matter of minutes), but the legal consequences will be,
shall we say, interesting.

Yes, that is the possibility that I am bringing up.  Here's another
example:  If Pumpkin Patch Nomic changes its name to Industrial Wasteland
Nomic, but the rest of its Gamestate remains more or less unchanged, does
it cease to be a voting member of InterNomic?  The appropriate answer will
likely depend on information beyond what is stated here.

When the original Rishonomic crashed, and we decided to start New
Rishonomic. It was my feeling that it's a different nomic, even thought it
inherited some things from the original Rishonomic. This is not the same
situation you are describing, because the process of creating New
Rishonomic was a meta game agreement between people.
 
As for the case of changing a nomic's name - a literal reading of the
Internomic rules, interpreted in analogous fashion to the intepretation
that accepts New Rishonnomic (2 ns) as a voting player, would exclude the
renamed nomic. I think this points just as much to a weakness in the
Internomic rules, that the names of members are explicitly defined by the
rules.
For now, it seems that the moderator is workingunder the assumption that
that younger nomic is a voting member, because e does not appear to accept
Voting Gnome's CFJs. I'll just have to resubmit them through another
nomic.

Can someone tell me the nature of the recent CFJ on Official duties
that are assumed in the middle of the week?  This was something that
Swann was involved in I believe, possibly because he found himself
suddenly an Officer. 

This is relevant because I don't know if I should be penalising myself
for failing to produce a Cartographor's Report since Morendil's
resignation on Friday.

Michael.

No, you have seven days as a resignation - in ASAP mode - to take
care of any business left undone by the previous holder of an Office
that you inherit.

======================================================================

                               CFJ 1061

   Rule 1585 should be interpreted such that a Player who is newly 
 installed into an Office does not commit the Infraction of Failure to 
 Report (insofar as that Office is subject to such duties) if e posts 
 the required Report within a week of eir being installed into Office.

======================================================================

Judge:       Steve

Judgement:   TRUE

Eligible:    Andre, Calabresi, ChrisM, Chuck, Crito, elJefe, 
	     General Chaos, Harlequin, Kolja A., Michael, Murphy, 
	     Oerjan, Steve, Vir, Vlad

Not eligible:
Caller:	     Morendil (not a player)
Barred:
On request:  Vanyel
On hold:     
Relevant Rules : 1585, 1686
Injunctions: See below

======================================================================

History:
  Called by Morendil, 29 Oct 1997 17:11:54 +0100
  Assigned to Steve, 30 Oct 1997 14:49:06 +0100 (MET)
  Judged TRUE by Steve, 2 Nov 1997 14:10:44 +1100 (EST)

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Rule 1686 designates the Infraction of Failure to Report as the
"failure to post the Official Report", an action that the same Rule
requires the Officer to perform "at least once every Nomic Week". 
Thus, at the beginning of a Nomic Week, the current holder of an 
Office immediately incurs this obligation, which is only lifted when 
the report is published.

When a new Officer is installed in that same Office (assuming that 
the Officer is a different Player), that duty becomes attached to the 
new Officer; further, Rule 1585 dictates that the timing requirements 
under which that duty must be fulfilled become those of ASAP. Rule 
1585 at Power 2 takes precedence over 1686, which conflicts with it 
in attempting to impose a different timing requirement ("at least 
once a week").

It is the *holder* of an Office that is the target of the Infraction, 
not the "Office as a whole" as Kolja quaintly puts it. I would argue 
that if the obligation pertains to the Office rather than the Player, 
the Infraction should be incurred by the Office too. ;)

I ask that the Judge issue an Injunction to Annotate Rule 1585 with 
the attached Statement and list of Relevant Rules.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

In the matter of CFJ 1061, I judge that the Statement is TRUE. The
Caller's arguments are persuasive.

I believe it was Crito who suggested that the Statement might be
trivially false because a Player newly installed into Office might
violate ASAP by posting eir Report out of order, even though within
the week. But Morendil's rebuttal is incisive: in that case, the
Player would be guilty of Tardiness, but not of Failure to Report.

======================================================================

Injunctions:

Firstly, I hereby grant Morendil's request for an Injunction to Annotate,
and enjoin the Rulekeepor to Annotate R1585 with the Statement and the list
of Relevant Rules.

Secondly, and as required by R1504, I hereby issue an Injunction enjoining
the Clerk of the Courts to vacate the Payment Orders, executed by then-
Registrar Zefram in his 'Salary Report 1997-W43', penalizing Kolja and
Steve for Failure to Report.

Here are my votes in the internal Referenda on Internomic Proposals:

353: AGAINST. We should add Rishonomic of course, but I like keeping
     Rishonnomic in as well.
354: AGAINST. Very wordy, and hardly any actual change.
355: ABSTAIN. I have a feeling this will not work. But if it would,
     it would be nice.

  I submit that it always was ambiguous, potentially referring to some

The Ambassador is correct that it has nothing to with the New Rishonnomic
bruhaha.  I discussed the idea several times on the Internomic mailing
list. Many moons ago there was another failed proposal of mine which
attempted to create a Games and Contests structure similar to acka's in
Internomic. Eventually I came to the idea of a charter nomic. This
proposal has two purposes. To create an environment where players of
member nomics can play subgames, which seems a very popular pastime in
Ackanomic. And to experiment with the concept ( and implementation) of a
charter nomic. The initial ruleset, as proposed, is still too large, to my
tase, for a generic charter nomic, but should do for a special case, such
as this.

I thought it was _the_ issue here.

Incidentally, there is nothing prohibiting the Assessor from summarizing
the last Public Votes now, either.  I don't really see that new
legislation on this is needed.

It's a pet peeve of mine.  Had it been in the actual Proposal, it
would have merited -2; -3 if it had been in text to be incorporated

Almost sounds like a reason to vote FOR. Some Organizations would do
very well inter-nomically. But, alas, I have abstained already.

If INP 352 passes, this will have the effect of removing Bluesmobile
Nomic from the list of members. Hardly a polite welcome for our newest
member!

I urge all conscientious member nomics to vote AGAINST INP 354.

Non-voting members can make CFJs. If it is true that Malenkai is not
accepting CFJs from the Voting Gnome, there must be a different reason.
Personally, I suspect that he is accepting them, he just hasn't gotten
around to distributing them yet. But you may know things that I don't.

CFJ 1061, called by Morendil and Judged by me, found that Officers
have one week from the time they become Officers to perform duties
left unperformed by their predecessors. R1585 should be Annotated
with the Statement of this CFJ.
