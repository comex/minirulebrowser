Um, there seems to be a mistake. You already distributed my Proposal

As I explained, the distribution as Proposal 3830 was null because
there has already been a Proposal 3830.

And I'm afraid that I am bound to accept Vlad's 2 votes for 3830 as
being for my proposal, and not his. If he had've waited half an hour
the Voting Period would have been over and he wouldn't have lost his
VTs.

That's relevance to quite a different matter. Since you insist that a
Referendum has not begun, I assume that you will not perform as Vote
Collector. But your insistence that the Referendum has not begun would
not legally protect you from a CFJ claiming that you violated R1434 by
failing to perform duties required of you by that Rule, if it turned out
that you were wrong that the Referendum has not begun, which I think you
are.

You're not going to dispute my claim that he had a Duty to Vote?

It's an interesting situation. Personally, I believe you are correct
that Kolja had effective control of 3 VTs and hence a duty to vote.
However, as his attorney, it may well be my role to defend his interests
by contesting your decision and making the best case I can against it
(although this perhaps confuses two senses of the word 'attorney').

Then, there are tactical considerations. Paying the POs does not
preclude me from disputing them. If they are found to be invalid,
reversing payments will be made. In the meantime, by paying the POs, I
have reduced Kolja's VT holdings below 3 and hence definitely protected
him from further duties to vote.

I'll think about it a little longer; then I may make a CFJ.

Following on in this same vein (both of defending Kolja's interests and
of exploring the limits of the Power of Attorney, which was Kolja's
instruction to me), I invite comment on the possibility of selecting
Kolja as the Judge of this CFJ, which as CotC I am free to do. What
would be the effect of this? In particular, does being Kolja'a Executor
grant me the right to deliver Judgement in his name?

Note that I could have tried to do this for my previous and much more
controversial CFJ (1118, to be distributed shortly), but refrained from
doing so in the interests of seeing justice done. Here, however, the
possibilities seem too delicious, and the consequences relatively
harmless, to make it extremely tempting.

I didn't bar Andre in this CFJ.  I believe the previous CFJ was when
this occurred.  My CFJ was meant to highlight the problem, but I
didn't end up barring anyone.

Through filter problems I have not received any mail for most of Saturday,
all of Sunday and the beginning of Monday. When checking the eGroups logs
for these dates, I saw a message 'Re: BUS: Re: OFF: Bank Transactions',
posted by Chuck to agora-business. Unfortunately, eGroups did not show any
text for this message. Was this message really empty, and if not, what did
it say?

I consent to sign this Concurring Opinion.

--Crito

>>> Scott Goehring <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us> 02/06/99 09:12PM >>>
While I agree that Peekee's Judgement is correct, I also believe that
Vlad's observation, that Rule 1868 precludes barring a Judge after e
has been selected, is also correct.  I therefore seek signatures to a
Concurring Opinion, to be attached to this Judgement, to read as
follows:

While we concur with Judge Peekee's Judgement in this CFJ, we would
like to note that Rule 1868 (specifically, that parge which reads
"Once assigned as the Judge of a CFJ, that Player remains the Judge of
that CFJ until e is recused from that CFJ, or e ceases to be a
Player.") operates to prevent a Player from Barring a Judge after e
has been selected.  Thus, the Caller of a CFJ may bar up to three
Players at any point, but may not bar the Player actually selected as
Judge, as long as e remains Judge; or, at least, the act of barring
the already-selected Judge would not cause em to cease to be the Judge
of that CFJ.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               !

No. This is utter crap. Scott's little 'explanation' of his snafu
didn't arrive in my mailbox until after I had cast my votes. I
refuse to be screwed over by this. I hereby COE Blob's claim that
I voted for his Proposal "Actions With N Supporters".

Argument: Scott gave my Proposal number 3830. That was perfectly
legal, even though it didn't meet the requirements of 109. Nothing
prohibits the Promotor from giving any identifier he wants to a 
proposal, in addition to the official number. Now, it is also not a
requirement that a Voter specify the official number when voting on
a Proposal. So I claim I was identifying my Proposal based on its
unofficial number (although I didn't know it was unofficial at the
time.) My identification was clearly ambiguous; so Blob has the
right to discard my votes. Or he can apply them to 3833. What he can't
do is provide incontrovertible evidence that I intended to vote on
Proposal 3830(3830) instead of Proposal 3830(3833).

If the above argument is not accepted, I expect G. Chaos to do the
right thing and reimburse me for the VTs lost due to his error.

Otherwise, it will be a cold day in hell before you see me pay my debt
for these so-called votes.

Vlad

Doesn't matter. The way I read the rules, the Payment Order is satisfied
by the execution of the Transfer Order, even if the Transfer Order fails to

a random proposal that you will designate six months from now as
Proposal 3833?

I'm not convinced of this.  It hinges on what it means to
"successfully execute" a Transfer Order.

Calling 3833 3830 was Promotor Chaos' idea, not mine. Surely, you
are not going to blame me for his mistake?

A legitimate argument can be made for the proposition that Vlad's
message was ambiguous in specifying which Proposal Vlad was voting
upon, and that you should record no votes on either 3830 or 3833 as a
result of that Voting message.  I would encourage you to take this
position.

I don't particularly care what Vlad means by "3833"; what I care about 
is what a reasonable person would think he means by it.  I think
that's quite clear under the circumstances.

Actually, these are perfectly valid votes.  I just may be that you will not have
enough VTs to actually pay for them, but they still count as votes.

--Crito

P.S.  I think there is some merit to your argument that the (invalid) 3830 number
you used actually referred to your own proposal, not to Blob's.  I think this
argument would have prevailed if you had actually quoted Scott's erroneous
message or had used the proposal title in your voting message.  I'm not so
sure, however, that it should be successful in this case since there is no clear
indication from the message itself that you intended to vote on 3833.  (You
might argue that the combination of votes presented indicated that you were
voting on the erroneous batch distributed by Scott, but I don't think this is a
*clear* indication.  It's only a reasonable inference).

Protoproposal VladPT.1

The following is not a Proposal

This Proposal is entitled "Progressive Taxation" and consists of a number
of Rule Changes, each marked by *

* Amend Rule 1853 (Levying Taxes) to read:

	 When (and only when) a Player is empowered to levy a tax on a
      Currency, e may do so by announcing the levy in the Public
      Forum. The announcement must specify which Currency the tax in
      being levied on (and this must be a Currency on which the Player
      making the announcement is empowered to levy a tax), the
      amount of the levy, expressed as a percentage of holdings of
      that Currency, which each entity in possession of that Currency
      will be required to pay to the Bank (the levy must be the same
      for all entities), and the Players subject to the tax, as
      specified in other Rules. If the Players subject to a tax are
      not specified, then all Players are subject to the tax.
 	 Unless the rule(s) authorizing a particular
      tax explicitly say so, the amount of the levy of that tax may
      never be larger than 50%.  As soon as possible after making the
      announcement, the Accountor is required to execute Payment
      Orders naming each entity other than the Bank in possession of
      the named Currency as payor, and with the Bank as payee, for an
      amount of the named Currency equal to the amount of the levy.

* Amend Rule 1852 "Circulation of Voting Tokens" by replacing the
last paragraph with the following text:

      The Accountor is responsible for ensuring that the number of
      Voting Tokens per Player in circulation does not exceed the
      Voting Token Circulation Level. To this end, at any time at
      which the number of Voting Tokens per Player in circulation
      does exceed the Voting Token Circulation Level, but only at
      such a time, the Accountor is empowered and required to levy a
      tax on Voting Tokens on those Players whose holdings exceed
      one-half of the VTCL, as described in other Rules.

No, I am merely saying you can't have your cake and eat it too.
If you are going to argue that your reference to Proposal 3830
was to Proposal 3833's unofficial designation as Proposal 3830,
then you must admit the possibility that your reference to Proposal
3833 might have been (as far as we know) to Proposal 4928's
unofficial designation as Proposal 3833.

Freshen 1796

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1796 be amended to read:

      (a) All Orders executed in the manner prescribed by the Rules
          for their class and type are presumed valid and enforceable.

      (b) In order for a Judge to find an Order invalid, the Judge
          must find that:
        (1) the Order was executed by a Player who the Rules did not
            permit to execute it;
        (2) the Order was executed in circumstances that neither
            required not permitted the execution of that Order; or
        (3) the Order has been rendered invalid by another Order or by
            the Rules.

      (c) A Judge who finds, during the course of judging a CFJ, that
          an Order is invalid shall vacate that Order, unless it has
          already been vacated.

      (d) Nothing in any Order shall act to prevent or hinder judicial
          review of that Order, and any portion of an Order which has
          this effect is void and without force, all other Rules
          notwithstanding.

Protoproposal Chaos222 [rev. 1]

Eliminate Transfer Orders

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1799 be amended to read:

      Any Order may always be amended, stayed, or vacated by the
      Player (or, in the case of Appellate Orders, Board of Appeal)
      who executed it.  Certain classes of Orders may be amended,
      stayed, or vacated in other circumstances as well, when the
      Rules so allow.  In all cases, this is done by an Order to
      Amend, Stay, or Vacate, respectively, the original Order.

      Otherwise, an Order shall not be amended, stayed, vacated, or
      otherwise changed once executed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1637 be amended to read:

      A Will is an SLC.  The Jurisdiction of a Will is always empty.
      Each Will belongs to exactly one entity.  The Notary shall be
      the Maintainer of all Wills.

      A Will shall specify the heirs of the entity to which it
      belongs, and how the currencies possessed by that entity and its
      other assets will be divided amongst those heirs when that
      entity is placed in Probate.  When an entity's Will is executed,
      the Executor in Probate of that entity will first execute all
      the transfers required by the Will (excepting those which e
      cannot execute or cannot execute successfully, for whatever
      reason), and will then divide the remaining residual assets as
      provided by the Will.

      A Will is created or amended by the Execution of an Application
      to Create a Will.  Such an Application must clearly identify the
      entity to which the Will is to belong, requires the Signature of
      the Executor of the entity to which the Will is to belong, and
      is Executed by submitting it to the Notary.  The effect of
      Executing such an Application is to create a Will belonging to
      that entity.  Any prior Will belonging to that entity is
      destroyed at the same time.

      A Will belonging to an Organization is not an SLC associated to
      that Organization, as defined elsewhere.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1727 be amended, by replacing the
paragraph reading:

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that, not less than seven days prior to
      Agora's Birthday, the Chancellor shall, on behalf of the Bank,
      submit delayed Transfer Orders to be executed at 00:04:30 GMT
      +1200 on Agora's Birthday to each Player for the amount of 3 VTs
      each;

with a paragraph reading

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that, as close to Agora's Birthday as
      possible, the Chancellor shall, on behalf of the Bank, execute
      transfers of 3 VTs to each Player;

and by replacing the paragraph reading:

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Chancellor shall, on behalf of
      the Bank, submit Transfer Orders for one P-note each from the
      Bank to each Player who posts to the Public Forum during Agora's
      Birthday a message recognizing Agora's Birthday; these Transfer
      Orders to be executed as soon as possible after Agora's Birthday
      ends;

with a paragraph reading

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Chancellor shall, on behalf of
      the Bank, execute transfers for one P-note each from the Bank to
      each Player who posts to the Public Forum during Agora's
      Birthday a message recognizing Agora's Birthday; these transfers
      to be executed as soon as possible after Agora's Birthday ends;

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1730 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1732 be amended to read:

      A Payment Order is only satisfied when a transfer to the payee
      of that Payment Order for the currency and amount named in that
      Payment Order is successfully executed, provided that, when that
      transfer was executed, its executor clearly indicated that that
      transfer was being executed for the purpose of satisfying the
      Payment Order in question.

      A given Payment Order can be satisfied at most once.  A vacated
      Payment Order cannot be satisfied.

      A given transfer may be used for the purpose of satisfying at
      most one Payment Order.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1735 be amended to read:

      The Chancellor is the Executor of the Bank.  As soon as possible
      after a Payment Order is executed for which the Bank is the
      payor, the Chancellor shall either (as the Bank's Executor)
      satisfy the Payment Order, or dispute it by making a COE or CFJ.
      However, the Chancellor need not do so if another Player makes
      such a COE or CFJ first.

      If the Chancellor executes a transfer from the Bank for any
      reason other than to satisfy a Payment Order (except when
      specifically required by the Rules to submit a Transfer Order),
      e commits the Class A Crime of Misappropriation, and upon
      conviction of this Crime shall be removed from Office.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1817 be amended to read:

      A Recordkeepor is required to record all valid transfers
      executed by the Executor of the owner of the units of Currency
      to be transferred (or, with respect to any entity which lacks an
      Executor, by any other person empowered by the Rules to execute
      transfers on the behalf of such entities), except for those
      transfers which would result in an entity possessing a negative
      quantity of Currency. Transfers shall be noted on the
      Recordkeepor's records in the order in which they are received
      by the Recordkeepor.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1818 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1739 be amended, by replacing the
paragraph reading

      Units of Currency are assigned to an entity by requiring a
      Transfer Order for those Units of Currency from the entity in
      Probate to that Entity.

with one reading

      Units of Currency are assigned to an entity by requiring the
      execution of a transfer of those Units of Currency from the
      entity in Probate to that Entity.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1820 be amended to read:

      Each Recordkeepor shall maintain a record of all transfered
      executed which specify the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor, for at least four weeks after their execution.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1823 be amended to read:

      If a Player is required to execute two or more Payment Orders,
      all of which name the same Payor, Payee, and Currency, that
      Player may elect to instead execute one Payment Order naming
      that Payor, Payee and Currency, and for an amount equal to the
      sum of all such Payment Orders required.  Doing so satisfies by
      substitution the requirement to execute all such Payment Orders.

      This Rule may not be applied with respect to any Payment Order
      required consequent to the vacation or stay of another Payment
      Order.

      Payment Orders to be executed for the purpose of paying for
      Voting upon Proposals may not be combined by this Rule with
      Payment Orders executed for any other purpose.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1757 be amended to read:

      The Trustee of an entity in Probate is empowered to execute on
      behalf of that entity whatever transfers are necessary to
      implement eir Plan for the disposition of that entity's Estate,
      as if e were that entity's Executor.  The Trustee may also
      execute and vacate Payment Orders when necessary to implement
      the Plan for the disposition of the Estate.

      The Trustee may exercise the above powers only when implementing
      a Plan for the disposition of the Estate of the entity in
      Probate of which e is the Trustee.

      The Trustee of an entity in Probate ceases to be Trustee when:

      (a) e announces in the Public Forum that e resigns as Trustee;

      (b) e ceases to be a Player;

      (c) the entity of which e is Trustee ceases to be in Probate; or

      (d) the Notary announces that e has been removed as Trustee.

      An entity in Probate ceases to be in Probate when its Trustee
      announces the completion of the implementation of a Plan for the
      disposition of the Estate of that entity.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1596 be amended to read:

      A Payment Order is an Order requiring an entity (the payor) to
      execute a transfer transferring units of a Currency from itself
      to some other entity (the payee).  A Payment Order specifies
      exactly one source entity, exactly one destination entity,
      exactly one Currency, and a number of units of that Currency
      which is a positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1598 be amended to read:

      A Transfer Notice is a message to the the Recordkeepor of a
      Currency reporting the transfer of units of that Currency from
      one entity to another.  A valid Transfer Notice specifies
      exactly one source entity, exactly one destination entity,
      exactly one Currency, and a number of units of that Currency
      which is a positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ.

      A transfer is executed by submitting a Transfer Notice to the
      Recordkeepor of the Currency in which it is denominated.

      If a transfer purports to be executed to satisfy a particular
      Payment Order and either that Payment Order does not exist or
      cannot be satisfied by that transfer, then the transfer is
      invalid.

There is no way I could honestly mistake Proposal 4928 for Proposal
3833, not least because the former hasn't been distributed yet. It
was possible to mistake 3833 as 3830, since it appeared so
designated in an official Report.

Do you mind? There is no need for insulting language. A mistake has 
been made. We have mechanisms for dealing with it. I made the simplest
possible interpretation of the situation, with full expectation that
the proper mechanisms would be used to overturn this if it was wrong.
No-one is trying to "screw you over".

As this is now a case for the courts (as I expected), I am not going to

No it didn't. It passed. I wrote this report by editing the previous 
one, and forgot to change that bit.

Not to the Public Forum, and the proposal "The Grand Agoran Tournament"
was mistakenly labelled P3830 above, and was later redistributed (or
renumbered) as P3833. Fortunately, you don't fall into the same muddle
that Vlad has because: a) the VP of the real P3830 is over, and b) your
votes and not counted as they did not go to the PF.

I have to echo Blob's comments here.  Venting bile accomplishes
nothing.  Neither does Claiming Errors every other message.  A

I was not accusing you of dereliction of duty, rather, attempting
to martial evidence that I had reason to believe I was, in fact, 
voting on my Proposal, and that therefore my votes were ambiguous.

In my opinion it is irrelevant what _you_ believed.  What matters is
what a reasonable person would have believed, informed of all
relevant facts.  And, in my mind, a reasonable person would have
believed that the message was ambiguous.

Dear Blob,

  I am sorry if I sounded insulting to you. I was (and am) mad
at the concatenation of circumstances that led to the mess I am
in and not (yet) at any one Player. I apologize for my language;
although I think it is applicable to the situation I am in, it
was wrong to include it in a reply to you message. Therefore,
Mr. Herald, I hereby transfer one Kudo from myself to Blob for
the above reasons.

Vlad

I'd like to understand the argument. How can a player action that violates
the Rules be "perfectly legal", I wonder?

Thankyou, Vlad. Apology accepted.

BTW: I am beginning to come around to your point of view on this
issue. The intent of your message was fairly plain. Plain enough for
me at least to consider the message ambiguous. I encourage the Judge
to support your case.

The confusion results for language. There is the offical number
required by 109, and other designations, which are permitted by 116.
I can give Proposal 3831 the number 23, pi, square root of two, or
anything else. Such acts of mine (or by anyone else) have nothing
to do with a Proposal's 109 number. In other words, 109 establishes
a requirement, but prohibits nothing. That is clear from the language.

Partial satisfaction isn't legal as of yet.  Note that as soon as
Steve gets around to it, the PO in question will be stayed and you
won't have to pay it until the Judge rules.

I understand but am not sure I agree. Rule 116 allows any player action
which is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule. Giving a proposal a number
is regulated by a Rule.
