The production of Houses and Farms changes based on what they're 
adjacent to. The maximum possible is 3 VTs or 3 P-Notes, but that's 
with all four adjacent locations favorable. My crystal ball says the 
average will be somewhere around 2, after everyone has a chance to 
get everything worked out.

I withdraw that remark. The Nominating Period for the Justiciar Election

Has the loophole in R1754 been closed so that Players cannot avoid
losing their VTs in the manner of General Chaos and Oerjan?

24 VTs per Player per month is way too many. As I've said, it's
my view that anything more than 2 VTs per Player per week will
destroy scarcity, and I won't support any figure above that.

Please read the later part of that paragraph. The 24 VT+P-Note 
estimated maximum is a _maximum_, not a reasonable estimate. That 
gives us a total of 2-4 VTs and P-Notes per player per week *before* 
accounting for churches, which are intended to sap a few VTs per 
player per week from the system.

BTW, the original Plots proto was intended for an environment in 
which Officer salaries were replaced with some other means of 
compensation.

Oh, I understand now. The base production is 1, but it can go as high 
as 3 when the adjacency rules kick in. Hsm. That makes it awfully hard
to figure how this is going to work out. Once again, I advocate that we
leave this extra complexity out, at least initially, and just get a 
simple base system working.

I have another theory: VTs are intrinsically more valuable than either
P-Notes or Indulgences. After all, one can avoid Blots if one is
careful, and not everyone wants to make Proposals. But everyone wants
to vote. Players will therefore hoard VTs for future use, if that is
possible, even if that means having more VTs now than they can use,
and even if it means doing without P-notes and Indulgences.

Now, I'm not sure if I've understood Plots completely, but am I right
in thinking that matters are arranged so that if everyone tries to
produce VTs, there won't be enough Ergs to pay the costs associated
with VT production? If so, that is good.

Is there much point creating 10,000 Ergs? The Chancellor can mint them
as required.

5 P-notes is too many, in both cases. Players don't make Proposals nearly
as often as they vote. By giving every Player 5 P-Notes, you're effectively
creating the opportunity to make 80 Proposals for free. It'd be a long
time before we saw P-Note scarcity after that. I'd recommend changing
it to 1 P-Note.

This doesn't use the PC structures for handling Currency transactions.
Why not? As you have it, Players are incurring obligations to pay Fees
automagically at the beginning of the month, without seeing a message
informing them that they have incurred this obligation. This is Bad,
the kind of Bad we introduced PC to avoid. Also, the Cartographor can
wait nearly the whole week before reporting Fees, leaving hours or
possibly only minutes before the Fees thus reported become
delinquent. Is this fair? If Players expected to keep track of their
own Maintenance Fees, why have the Cartographor keep track of them?
If the Rule were made PC-compliant, this problem wouldn't arise: no
Player would incur an obligation to pay a Maintenance Fee until
the Cartographor had reported it by executing a PO for Ergs, and no
Fee could become delinquent until a week after that.

One last question: am I right or wrong in assuming that Structures are
limited to one per Plot? Can you point me to the part of the proto where
this is specified?

I don't seem to have time write this Proposal right now. I think
what I'm going to do is propose the patch I first wrote, which
fixes the bugs, and worry about a new version of the Officer Rules
later.

Yes I have:

      A Player may Call for a Revolt at any time, by sending to the 
      Public Forum saying e does so. A Call for Revolt is only effective
      if the following conditions are met:

         i) The player posting the Call is Rebellious,
        ii) No other effective Call for Revolt has been made that week,
       iii) A successful Revolt has not occured for a month or more.

Okay - you devised Plots, and I devised Jobs at the same time. The point
of Jobs, was to create the economic imbalance that I have been talking
about. It happened to be quite neat to combine the two. I'm not sure 
what your original purpose was in designing plots.

I'll probably continue with the Plots formulism, since it seems very
popular, but I'll limit its functionality to just those features I
was looking for in the first place. Then all the other stuff in the
Plots 3.1 can be added as other players see fit.

I had a look at our early attempts at a Plots proto, and I don't think
I'll be reusing them - they are a bit of a mess. I think it would be
easier to start again from scratch.

Things will certainly fall apart if everybody tries to produce only VTs.
Well, there is the possibility that everybody build just 1 Farm and 
1 Mine, and thus makes 1 VT/week, with no left over Ergs, after 
maintenance, to build anything more. But that's about the limit. If you
want to produce anything extra, then you need to start specialising
(you build mines, I build farms, and we trade).

Hm. Production is weekly, Maintenance monthly. What happens if I take
my weekly production for three weeks, then trade in my Structures
in anticipation of not being able to pay Maintenance on them? Perhaps
Maintenance should be paid in advance?

Yes, the arbitration of Style is clearly an irresistable weapon with
which to bring recalcitrant Hostile Nomics to heel.

If, however, you wish to entrust the Office of Commander-in-Chief to
one who is a veteran organizer of plots and an experienced and
indefatigable conspirator, qualities which the Office clearly demands
from its holder, then vote for Steve.

They will only have that effect if people spend Ergs to build them.
Personally, I wouldn't waste my Ergs building Churches, since I
can avoid Blots by paying my bills on time. Churches don't even
have a guaranteed income of Indulgences; they merely increase your
chances of getting one randomly distributed to you. Thanks, but I'd
rather take the guaranteed VT income of a Farm, or perhaps, in an
Erg-scarce environment, a Mine. I suspect most Players will think
likewise.

Nevertheless, that's not the environment 'Plots' is likely to operate
in, and it should be designed accordingly.

Having checked the Complete OED, I think I agree with you. For 'pun'
it gives, inter alia:

pun, sb. The use of a word in such a way as to suggest two or more
meanings or associations, or the use of two or more words with
the same or nearly the same sound with different meanings, so as to
produce a humourous effect.

With that definition in front of me, I'd have to say that Crito's
Proposal did contain a pun. Of course, that still may not be enough
to satisfy the Silly Proposal Rules.
