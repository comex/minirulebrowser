And how will this measure change the situation? I'd think it'd

It will put more pressure on people who wants P-Notes to get them from
the people who are hoarding them, by whatever means they can think of.

Driving up the prices of P-Notes is supposed to -reduce- the holdings of
those players? By making P-Notes more valuable, you make their P-Note
holdings very valuable. 10 PN at 1 VT each isn't much; 10 PN at 3 VT
each is a relative fortune. So these players trade a few P-Notes for
even more VT. Then the Voting Tariff will be raised...

Personally, I think a high Voting Tariff or Priority Bar will only aid
the richer players. If they control a majority of a commodity, making
that commodity more valuable is the wrong approach. A majority of a
worthless commodity is still a worthless commodity.

May I explain your motives? The actual result of your move will
be to discourage proposing. No one really _needs_ to propose,
and I think one can safely say there will be fewer proposals.
As a result, more of your proposals will get through the queue.

Why?  For obvious reasons, I don't want more than one of my Proposals
distributed each week, and I have sufficient resources to be able to
ensure that at least one of them gets distributed in almost any week
if I so desire it.  If anything, lowering the Proposal Bar would make
it easier by requiring me to expend smaller quantities of my resources
toward that goal.  You also seem to assume that I intend for every
Proposal I make to be distributed, an assumption which may not be
accurate.

Raising the Proposal Bar also makes my Privilege less valuable; from a 
standpoint of personal aggregation of wealth or power it's arguably a
bad move.

Hm.  I just had an idea.

Protoproposal Chaos244 [rev. 1]

Cooperation is a Good Thing

Be it resolved, that Rule 1771 be amended, by replacing the paragraph
reading

      The Priority of the Proposal is increased or decreased, as
      specified by the Player making the payment, by an amount equal
      to the number of P-Notes transferred to the Bank, provided that
      this transfer is not executed for any other purpose.

with one reading

      The Priority of the Proposal is increased or decreased, as
      specified by the Player making the payment, by:
      (a) an amount equal to one-half the number of P-Notes
          transferred to the Bank, if the transferor was the Proposer
          of that Proposal, or
      (b) an amount equal to the number of P-Notes transferred to the
          Bank, otherwise;
      provided that this transfer is not executed for any other
      purpose.

[ This gives Players an incentive to get other people to pay to
  advance their Proposals in the Proposal Queue. ]

I like this proposal. Sneaky and devilish!

I will even donate a few P-Notes to help it pass.
