I'd like to call on Chancellor Michael and Accountor lee to work in
tandem to adjust the current policy settings. In particular, I'm arguing
for an increase in the BOS to at least 0.6 VTs, perhaps even 0.8 VTs,
and a simultaneous lowering of the Voting Token Circulation Level to 5
VTs/Player.

The increase in the BOS is justified on two independent grounds.
Firstly, the recent removal of 4 Offices has reduced the total BOS
entering circulation per week from 20.5 to 15.5 (although to that must
be added the Distributor's payment and the Assessor's Commission). If
the aim were to keep the total VTs entering circulation roughly
constant, then this argument would justify an inrease in the BOS to 0.6
VTs. Additionally, however, as Macross has recently argued, VTs have
become so valuable that many Players are reluctant to spend them on the
average Proposal. To alleviate this situation, a further increase in the
BOS is indicated. A BOS of 0.7 VTs/week means an unemployment benefit
of 0.35 VTs/week, which would mean that an unemployed Player could
afford to vote once every 3 weeks instead of once every 5 weeks. A BOS
of 0.8 would reduce that to once every 2 1/2 weeks.

The argument for lowering the VTCL is a bit more subtle. Any increase in
the BOS is almost certain to lead initially to an imbalance in the
economy, with more VTs entering circulation than leaving. Eventually,
the number of VTs in circulation will exceed the threshold at which the
Accountor will become required to levy a tax. Lowering the VTCL simply
means that this will happen sooner rather than later. So why lower the
VTCL?

The VTCL represents in effect a length of time stretching into the
future during which it still makes sense to save one's VTs. At present,
with the VTCL set at 9, this length of time appears to be long enough to
make it worth Players' while, especially Officers, to save their VTs.
This is especially true while the BOS remains low and the economy
roughly in balance, for while those conditions prevail, the prospect of
tax is indefinitely postponed. By dramatically lowering the VTCL at the
same time as raising the BOS, we will deliberately create an imbalance
in the economy which will be corrected in one of two ways: either taxes
will be levied, repeatedly so, or expenditure will rise to soak up the
extra liquidity. Officers should come to the conclusion that any VTs
they don't spend now they will lose in tax in just a few weeks' time.

Of course, these arguments hold true to some extent no matter what the
level of the VTCL is. But by lowering the VTCL we will bring forward the
decision time for Officers, and sharpen their choices immediately.

Finally, the third plank in my proposal is the adoption of 'A Duty to
Vote', which I hope will be distributed shortly. I know that some
Players are opposed to this Proposal. But I believe that there are
excellent reasons to adopt it. It basically will not affect the
unemployed. Particularly in concert with other measures described above,
it should really give Officers a forceful incentive to vote. And it has
a built in sunset clause to emphasize is temporary and experimental
nature. If we don't like it, it will go away on its own, like the ban on
Presence did.

Hm. Which Rule was selected fifth? Rule 106 (Adopting Proposals), or
Rule 1069 (Amendment Numbers)?

Proto-Proposal
The P-Note Tap

[Comment: the number of P-Notes in circulation has been slowly but
steadily increasing for some time, and will likely continue to do so.
The idea I have to combat this is basically a new Currency lever, this
one less subtle than that which the Chancellor has controlling VT
supply: this lever simply turns P-Note supply on, or off. When the
P-Note Tap is on, the Bank pays P-Note POs as normal. When the Tap is
off, the Bank stops paying P-Note POs (the Chancellor vacates them
instead of paying them).]

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "The P-Note Tap", be created
with the following text:

      The P-Note Tap is either on or off. Initially, the Tap is on.
      While the Tap is on, the Bank's executor shall satisfy Payment
      Orders naming the Bank as payor in the normal way, as described in
      other Rules. While the Tap is off, the Bank's executor is not
      required to satisfy any Payment Order naming the Bank as payor,
      nor shall e do so; e is instead required to vacate any such
      unsatisfied Payment Order (including Payment Orders which were
      executed while the Tap was on, but remained unsatisfied when the
      Tap was turned off), either as soon as possible after it is
      executed, or as soon as possible after the Tap is turned off,
      whichever occurred later. This Rule takes precedence over any Rule
      which would require the Bank's executor to satisfy Payment Orders
      naming the Bank as payor while the Tap is off.

      The Promotor is the sole Player authorized to turn the P-Note Tap
      on, or off, and e may do either by posting the appropriate notice
      to the Public Forum, provided that at least a week has passed
      since e last turned the Tap on or off.

Recently argued?  I have been making this same point for months now.  I'm
glad that you finally seem to have noticed it.  :)

My gut reaction is to oppose this on principle.  I favor incentives to Vote
over penalties for not Voting.  I'm not opposed to a tax but using it to
penalize savings I do oppose.

I strongly oppose this.  I intend to vote against it and I encourage others
to do likewise.

Surely there must be a way to provide incentive to Vote?  Must an increase
in Voting be achieved by penalties?

I was hoping for more than a gut reaction - an argument, say. I do not
think it is fair to say that lowering the VTCL means penalizing Players
for not voting. It is, in fact, exactly what you say you want: an
incentive to vote, nothing more.

If you insist that the operation of the VTCL constitutes a penalty for
not voting, then you must be opposed to the VTCL tout court. Yet you say
you are not opposed to a tax, so it's not clear to me exactly what your
position on the VTCL is. I can't see any difference in basic principle
between a VTCL set at 9 and one set at 5. The latter value, as I argued,
simply provides an incentive for Players to spend rather than save.

Again, I was hoping to elicit from you cogent reasons for your
opposition. What is so terrifying about a 3 month experiment with a
different voting regime? Nomic is, after all, about change. I can't
emphasize enough that if we don't like this, it will go completely away
on its own, without anybody's having to do anything.

As I say, lowering the VTCL is one such way. It ought to provide a
strong incentive to vote, in which case not too many Players will end up
being penalized by A Duty to Vote.

I'm open to other ideas. I've already taken on board your suggestion of
increasing VT supply.
