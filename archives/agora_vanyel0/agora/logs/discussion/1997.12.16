The problem is not so much with ordinary Rules as it is with errors.  You
cannot plan for the unexpected in every single Rule, although we try. 
Inevitably something appears which has different interpretations due to a
flaw.

I find this UNNECESSARILY bureaucratic.  I would EVEN prefer Without
Objection to that.

Now, I BELIEVE there is room within the CURRENT system for a slight change
in PROCEDURE:

1)  Perform, close to the beginning of the WEEK, steps (i.1), (ii.1-2),
and POSTPONE selections (i.2), (ii.3).
2)  Wait for COMMENTS and possibly OBJECTIONS.
3)  Close to the end OF the WEEK, perform the REMAINING steps.

Would that be SUFFICIENT?  (Especially if supported FURTHER by
legislation.)

NORTH IS _A_ OPTION,
ØRJAN.

I think you are mistaken (also, you mean 3642 through 3644, unless you
paid the petition fee for elJefe's proposals 8).

Here is a copy of the text you sent me for the proposals.  I can't find any

This message contains one or more Proposals.  Each Proposal begins

immediately before a line marked "**END PROPOSAL".

The following Proposal is to be titled "No Double Penalties for
Officers" and is to have Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1007 be amended by deleting the
paragraph which begins "If the Rules pertaining...".

[It's truly unfair to Officers to both take away their Salaries _and_
whap them with an Infraction for the same thing.  Especially for the
Assessor, whose primary duty, tabulating Votes, does not yield a
document which must be published once each week.]


**END PROPOSAL

The following Proposal is to be titled "Lowered Quorum" and is to have
Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 879 be amended, by replacing the
text "35% of all Players, or 50% of all the Players not On Hold" with
"one-third of Active Players, or one-fifth of all Players".


**END PROPOSAL

The following Proposal is to be titled "Liberalize Speaker's
Patronage" and is to have Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1661 be amended, by replacing "for
an amount not in excess of 1 VT" with "for not more than 1 unit of any

Well, I can think of two situations Platonists and Pragmatists disagree
on, and one they (sort of) agree on. The approaches to rule violations
and automatic moves are different, but the way of resolving failures to do
rule-mandated actions (particularly where penalties for failure are
defined) are the same. So obviosly, everyone will agree if the first two
types of rules are rephrased as compultions on players. Which, strangly
enough, is what Pragmatic Currencies does :-)

But the Virus also cleans up after itself. Even if it were to infect
a crucial Rule, and say, make voting impossible, the effect would
only last two weeks.

I see your point, but since R1729 is the only Rule which at present seeks
to limit discussion in any way, I thought it would be worth having the
reference in the annotation.

Now, the question I have to ask myself is: should I invoke the little
(never before?) used R1725?

I can't produce a current Ruleset until I know which of 3601-3623
passed.  Part of the problem is that those which did pass and
were previously announced as having passed took effect at the
moment they were first announced as having passed, even if the
report of specific votes was incorrect.

Very well.  H. Assessor, it is the Rulekeepor's opinion that
"Restore Game Balance II" has not yet repealed itself, as the
decrease in VTs owned by the Bank in step 4 has not yet been
reported.

Also, Michael, although I don't want to take over the Office of
Assessor, I will prepare the Voting Report for 3601-3632 if
you like, if either you or Scott will forward me the votes on those.
