Well, I restricted the lists as per Oerjan's suggestion; then I tried
to tell you all about it, and this is what happened:

The problem is that silas is now a cluster consisting of silas-1 and
silas-2. I've subscribed my silas-1 address to the lists using my powers
as list administrator so that I can send this message. I wonder how many 
others will encounter similar difficulties. I'll be monitoring the 
situation closely.

Hm, and it looks as if I don't have control over which machine in the
cluster actually sends my mail, so that for example, I just sent
the voting results for Proposals 3745-3746, and it bounced back to
me because gecko wouldn't recognize 'gardner@silas-2' as a subscriber.
What I've ended up doing is subscribing 'gardner@silas' to discussion,
'gardner@silas-1' to business, and 'gardner@silas-2' to official. Since
a subscriber to any of the lists can post to any of the lists, that
ought to work.
