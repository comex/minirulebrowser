I admit this: an individual Blot is a NE. However, I'm saying it's
irrelevant. Your argument relies on Blots being a type of Entity, which
they are not.

I don't agree that that a low Power Rule can never change the meaning
of a high Power Rule by redefining terms. For instance, I take it that
the meaning of a high Power Rule which employed the phrase 'as soon
as possible' would be changed if R1023 were to be amended. On the
other hand, some such amendments to R1023 (for example, defining
'as soon as possible' to mean 'never') might be held to be repugnant
to the use of the phrase in the high Power Rule and hence to conflict
with it. The conditions under which such redefinitions are acceptable
(or not) are a matter for judgement.

A very odd sentence, since Players are not Nomic Entities. In general,
I'm much happier with the definition of Nomic Property in R1011 than
I am with the definition of Nomic Entity in R1586. Consider my Kudos
for instance. I have 34 of them. Are they not considered to be 34
individual Entities? It seems they must be, since they can be
transferred individually. But then it seems that according to R1586,
each of my Kudos must have a different name - which seems an absurd
requirement. They're all just Kudos, surely. I take this as evidence
that something is wrong with our definition of Nomic Entity.  Perhaps
we need to disintguish types (or classes, if you must) of Nomic
Entity from instances of them. Then we could say that no two types of
Nomic Entity may have the same name.

But such authority is itself derived from the Rules. The new PC Rules
(or is it the new Mint Authority Rules?) give the Chancellor the authority
to mint units of Currency in the Bank. I don't think this should stop
us from thinking of VTs as Nomic Entities.

True enough. But to me that suggests that the problem is one merely
of disambiguation: which is meant? The problem is not hard to solve,
however, since it doesn't make sense to speak of 'satisfying a pale
blue chip', whereas it does make sense to speak of 'satisfying a
requirement stated by a person'. Nothing in the Rules suggests that
we must associate each such requirement with one of your pale blue chips.

The conditions of creation aren't the conditions I was speaking of,
and no wonder. Orders are bodies of text, and the Rules no more 
speak of the conditions under which they are created than they speak
of the conditions under which any other body of text is created.
The Rules exist in an environment in which it is taken to be a
background assumption that human players are constantly creating
bodies of text, some of which are given various kinds of legal
significance. At any rate, the conditions I was talking about were
conditions of satisfaction, execution, vacation, cancellation and
such like - none of which make any sense when applied to your newly
minted Currencies.

Um, I don't follow this.  I agree an instance of a Blot is an instance of a 
Nomic Entity, but I don't see how this makes the type "Blot" not a type of 
Nomic Entity.  To me the definition of "type" is just a name given to an 
arbitrarily defined class of entities.  So, IMO, "a specific number of units 
of a particular type of Nomic Entity" is a perfectly good class definition for 
the type Blot - which, to me, seems to make a Blot a type of Nomic Entity 
(i.e. a type, the instances of which are Nomic Entities).  Or are you saying 
that the type itself is not a Nomic Entity?

I stand by the usefulness of the poker chip analogy. I agree with
you that, in general, if a game make references to negative quantities
of something or other, then physical tokens distinct from those used
to represent positive quantities of that same thing will need to be
used to represent them. Your red chip/blue chip suggestion is a most
natural one, if chips are being used. If being in net debt were possible
in Monopoly, then the game would probably come equipped with negatively
numbered plastic money to represent net debts. So what's your objection?
That there are now two kinds of plastic bills representing only one
kind of thing - money? That's no objection at all, as I hope the example
makes clear.

Let's grant for the same of argument that Blots are Nomic Entities,
and that they are equivalent to Payment Orders of some kind. So
what? This equivalance is written into the Rules, which state that
Blots are (equivalent to) Payment Orders. Nowhere in the Rules does it
state that your newly minted Currencies are (equivalent to) Payment
Orders. They only say, or imply, that they are named 'Payment Orders'.
That is not enough, in my view, to secure the equivalence you seek.

I don't think so. If a Blot is an Entity, then "Blots" certainly refers to all 
Entities which are a Blot, and that constitutes a class of Entities.

No one in Agora, you mean. Hackers the world over specialize in stealing 
virtual money by entering banks' computers (or so the press would have us

I wholeheartedly disagree with that claim, and for several reasons. An obvious 
one is that nothing distinguishes one P-Note from another, and thus that it 
seems quite unreasonable to assume that an Entity that we call a P-Note 
corresponds to any particular set of actual, physical particles. Whereas you 
can count poker chips, mark them and so on. Agoran Entities have well-defined 
conceptual boundaries which it would be hopeless to attempt to map to physical 
boundaries. Further, some manipulations on Agora Entities correspond to no 
movement of physical entities at all; such as any automatic change in Currency 
or other holdings which happens automatically at the start of a Nomic Week.

Or take a hypothetical Rule stating that at the beginning of the Week, a
number of Kudos from 0 to 10 are transferred from Player A to Player B, the
number being determined in a non-deterministic manner equiprobably among the
range of possible choices. This would make the Kudo status of those Players
unknowable, to be sure, but it would not, nevertheless, make it impossible to
derive effects upon the Game State that were based on conditions like "the
probability that Player A has more Kudos than Player B after N Weeks".

Post its text to the Public Forum. There's no reason why (Currency) POs can't
be associated with a body of text, and Executing something is a well-defined 
action as long as that something has a text associated with it. There is in 
fact a lot of virgin territory to be explored in that respect. And there is, in 
fact, a Rule-sanctioned manner in which any property at all can be attached to 
an entity; that is the operation of a legal SLC.

I can make no sense of the Rules calling for an Application to be destroyed,
either, if an Application is a message I post to the Public Forum (or, in
fact, as the Rules allow, write down in the privacy of my own home). Why isn't
that a problem if Executing a unit of Currency is a problem ?

Your point of view is supported by Stare Decisis. Which is hardly any
wonder, as you were one of the judges issing the Judgement in question:

======================================================================
                 FINAL JUDGEMENT OF APPEAL CFJ 858

    Rule 1482 should be interpreted such that the meaning of a word
    used in a Rule is a part of the Rule's meaning, and therefore
    cannot be changed significantly by Rules of lower precedence.

======================================================================

Board of Appeals:       Decision:
    favor               FALSE
    elJefe              FALSE
    Steve               FALSE

Final Judgement:        FALSE

Original Judge:         Coren
Original Judgement:     TRUE

Caller:                 Zefram
Barred:                 
On Hold:                Blob

======================================================================

Arguments of the Justices:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

favor:

This is a difficult one, touching on an important issue that I
think has not been heavily treated by previous Courts.  The
question at issue is exactly what constitutes a conflict
between two Rules for the purposes of Rule 1482.  It seems
clear to me that if a low-MI Rule attempts to change the meaning
of a word or words in a higher-MI Rule, and that attempt constitutes
a conflict, then the attempt fails per 1482.  It also seems
clear that *some* such attempts would count as conflicts,
and therefore fail ("The phrase 'abide by all', in the Rules
of Agora Nomic, shall mean 'ignore'.")

The remaining question, then, is whether or not there are *any*
changes of meaning which would *not* count as conflicts for
the purposes of 1482.  One obvious candidate is a change of
meaning which is simply a clarification of a word that is not
otherwise defined in the Rules, changing the meaning only by
making it tighter and better-defined.  For instance, a rigorous
set of Rules which defined just what an "action" is in
Game terms should be able to touch the meaning of "action"
in Rule 1011, even if the Rule doing the defining was only
MI=1, as long as this touching did not fundamentally alter
the import and functioning of the higher-MI Rule.  A
rigorous definition of what it means to have "legal force"
should be able to touch the use of that term in Rule 114,
without having to be MI=3.  If some high-MI Rule makes a
passing reference to a Nomic Week, it should be possible
for a change to the low-MI Nomic Week Rule to touch the
meaning of that high-MI Rule at that point, without
requiring a higher VI.

I therefore find that the Statement here is FALSE, because
there are circumstances under which it is not true.  While
there are many cases in which a change to the meaning of
a word *would* fail per 1482, there are also some in
which it would not, because it would not be per se a
conflict.  The electorate, and in extremis the Courts,
will have to determine for themselves where each
individual case falls on the continuum.

It would be possible to find otherwise, and by finding
FALSE I may be leaving open a loophole in the Mutability
system through which demons will escape to plague the
community.  But I believe that the danger of that is
outweighed by the desire to keep flexibility in the
Ruleset, and not require elaborate and difficult
actions (such as passing Proposals with unusual AIs)
to acheive mundane ends (such as adjusting the meaning
of a word).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Steve:

I'd like to begin by thanking Favor, Eljefe and Vanyel for the
valuable contributions they have made to the discussions about
this Statement. As a result of them, I think a consensus view has
emerged about how the issues raised by the Statement should be
treated, a result which I think constitutes valuable progress.

Although the other Justices, Favor and Eljefe, will doubtless
give similar arguments to the ones I give here, I think it is
worth including my own individual take on the subject.

I think the CFJ was motivated by a desire to see prohibited a
process which I have called 'amendment by stealth'. An example
of amendment by stealth would be a Rule which stated that, for
the purposes of R1322, 'less than' is to be understood to mean
'greater than'. The question arises, could such a Rule have its
intended of effect (of totally undermining the system of Mutability
Indices), despite the fact the R1322 has MI=3, and our hypothetical
Rule only MI=1? If it could, then it would seem that high mutability
is not much protection against a radical change in the meaning
and application of a Rule.

However, a powerful argument can be made against the possibility of
such obviously pathological cases of amendment by stealth. This is
the argument given by the Caller, namely, that amendment by stealth
effectively constitutes a Rule Change by means other than those
sanctioned by the Rules, and is therefore illegal. I am inclined
to accept this argument - for obviously pathological cases.

Problems arise, however, as soon as it is noticed that, firstly,
not all cases are as pathological as the above, and secondly, that
it may not always be clear whether a case is pathological or not.
An example: let us suppose that the phrase 'as soon as possible'
was used in the Ruleset prior to its having been given a definition
in the Rules for the first time by Proposal 805 (I don't know if
that's true or not, but it might well be). After the passage of
Proposal 805, could the new R805 be effective in giving the phrase
'as soon as possible' the meaning it tried to give it, a meaning
which is considerably different from the ordinary meaning of that
phrase? In one sense, the point is moot, since our subsequent
behaviour shows that we did accept R805 as successfully defining 'as
soon as possible'. Furthermore, we have since changed the meaning
of that phrase several more times, each time without incident.
This example alone is enough to show that the Statement is false,
for here we have a case where the meaning of a word (or a phrase
in this case) can be changed by changing a Rule which might well
be of lower precedence. That is, we take R1023 as defining what
'as soon as possible' means, for all Rules which use that phrase,
of whatever precedence.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I distinguish two cases in the subject of the CFJ.  Where a Rule is clearly
relying for its meaning on the ordinary natural-language meaning of a word,
that meaning ought not be "hijacked" by a lower-precedence Rule.  However,
the statement also seems to cover the case where a Rule is explicitly relying
for its meaning on the definition of a word contained or supposed to be
contained in other (possibly lower-MI) Rules.  In this case, and in most
cases where an ambiguity or omission in a Rule is clarified by a lower-
precedence Rule, the meaning is shared by that lower-precedence Rule and
subject to change when the lower-precedence Rule is changed.

Rule 101 can be our guide.  It says that players must obey the Rules
"in the form in which they are then in effect".  I would say that if a
Rule uses a term whose meaning is imprecise, or which could rely (either
wholly or partially) for its meaning on another Rule, and another Rule
supplies the missing meaning, then the "form" of the Rules requires that
we assign the meaning given in the second Rule, even if it has a lower
MI, and if that second Rule is changed then the meaning changes.

However, if a Rule uses a term whose meaning is precise in ordinary 
English (e.g. "greater than"), then a lower-precedence rule cannot
change this to something different ("in Rule XXX, "greater than" shall 
mean "less than"). In a case like this, the Rules would have the
"form" of a conflicting Ruleset, which would be dealt with by the
appropriate conflict-resolution mechanism.

Right.  And so Kudos, etc. provide evidence that game custom has established
the interpretation of R1586 to refer to types of Nomic Entities rather than
specific individual instances of a type.

Yes, the *authority* to create a class of currency entities called Orders is
derived from the rules, but the actual creation of them is not.  That is the
difference between Morendil's Orders and VTs and IMO is what makes VTs Nomic
Entities and Orders not.

Well, let me put this whole argument in perspective. Morendil claims that
Blots are a type of Nomic Entity, and therefore, since the Rule which
originally defined them no longer defines them in the same fashion, they
cease to exist. My claim is that they are then simply not known as "Blots,"
since they still exist as -1 Indulgences.

Look at the text regarding Disputed Payment Orders:

      A Payment Order is disputed if there is a COE regarding it which
      has not been denied, or a CFJ challenging the legality of its
      execution which is either presently assigned to a Judge or to a
      Board of Appeals for consideration.

While perhaps you can argue that a CFJ remains assigned to a Judge or Board
of Appeals, it would be rather difficult to argue that it is "assigned for
consideration" when the Judge has already considered and ruled on the CFJ.

There is no reason there *should* be, either. For an Entity, having a body
of text associated with it is a Nomic Property, and no Rules indicate that
your Currency should have such a Property.

<snip>

Well, then. If we are going to interpret the rules this way, the new PC
rules state both that "A Payment Order is an order..." and "A Transfer
Order is an order..." Now, we seem to have an entity known as an "Order"
already, and neither your Payment Orders nor your Transfer Orders are the
same as your Orders. Since the Rules state that POs and TOs must *be*
instances of Orders, and yours are not, obviously the TOs and POs in the
Rules cannot correspond to your TOs and POs.

First, I believe there is Stare Decisis precedent on this matter, which
support's Steve's position. Andre?

Second, Rule 1467 gives some evidence that Currencies are Nomic Entities:
it says that entities are Currencies "if and only if it is made such by the
Rules," and that "Neither Currency nor units of Currency shall be created
or destroyed except as specified in the Rules." Thusly, they owe their
basic existence to the Rules, even if created by another entity.

I would agree with this, except I'm not sure the definition of Blot as -1
Indulgence survived the PC proposal.  I really need to spend time looking at
the Rules in their new form.  Hope to have time this afternoon.  8)

In any case, I think the provisions for continuity of entities guarantees that
Blots remain, even if they have been redefined to be represented by POs.

Not really-being a Player or not is a Nomic Property of a person,
which is not a Nomic Entity.

Au contraire.  R1586 only states that no two Entities may have
the same name.  It does *not* require that every Nomic Entity
have a name.

It did not.  In my opinion, all this did was sever the connection
between Blots and antiIndulgences, without affecting the existence of
the antiIndulgences in any way.

I disagree.  It merely means that individual Kudos, etc., do not

I don't think that there's any problem with the current situation.
Wait until the CFJs are resolved and see if there is a problem
(I think there isn't) before proposing to fix it.

You are forgetting :

Rule 1592/0 (Power=1)
Authority of SLCs to Change Properties

      A SLC has the power to define the manner in which certain
      properties of entities are changed.  This power shall be limited
      to any property solely defined by that SLC and to any other
      property to which the Rules grant that SLC this authority.

The text of a (Currency) PO or TO would be such a property. If, that
is, they are not the same Entities as (non-Currency) POs and TOs.

Well, the Rules also mandate that 'my' POs and TOs are also Orders. Same
difference.

My point is that currencies defined by the Rules
are Nomic Entities but currencies defined and
minted by Players or groups under the authority of
the Rules are *not* Nomic Entities because they do
not owe their basic existence *only* to the Rules.
It's true, without the Rules they could not exist,
but even with the Rules they do not exist without
the *additional* property of being defined and
minted by some other entity. I don't think R1467
provides any evidence for or against this
distinction since the Rules authority covers both
Nomic and non-Nomic entities. But of course, this
is *my* interpretation of R1586, I could be wrong.

First, I believe there is Stare Decisis precedent
on this matter, which
support's Steve's position. Andre?

Second, Rule 1467 gives some evidence that
Currencies are Nomic Entities:
it says that entities are Currencies "if and only
if it is made such by the
Rules," and that "Neither Currency nor units of
Currency shall be created
or destroyed except as specified in the Rules."
Thusly, they owe their
basic existence to the Rules, even if created by
another entity.

Along with the comment that Rule 1586 does not prohibit two entities
from both not having a name.

Hmm.  Yes, I think that's a valid way of looking at it.  So 1586 then is
interpreted as referring to both types and instances of types.  But can I call
one of my Kudos "Sneezy"?  8)

Parker Brothers used to sell a board game, called Life, which included
$20,000 "Promissory Notes", which were essentially negative $20,000
bills.

I'm not sure.  Probably, but a name attributed to an entity in this

I've never liked Rule 1586. :)

I understand. My argument is that the Rule is talking about "continued
existence," not creation -- that is, they continue to exist merely because
of the Rules, not initially exist because of the Rules. The other point is
that owing their existence to the Rules means that they would have no
existence without the Rules, i.e. they do not actually have a physical
existence, which keeps them separate from physical entities like people,
bodies of text, and so on. Under that definition, any entity that is not a
physical item of some sort would be a Nomic Entity. And if the Nomic Entity
rules *don't* work like that, then they should.

I agree with Scott here. Blots are Nomic Entities, and negative
Indulgences are (in their own twisted way, since I dislike the idea of
negative entities) Nomic Entities, and they are the same Nomic Entities.
Therefore, when Blots stopped being defined as negative Indulgences, they
continued to exist as Nomic Entities, while no longer being Blots.

The above is, of course, IMO, and should not be construed as the truth
unless you agree with it. (Now isn't that a useless disclaimer? :-)

Hmm.  Maybe.  But to me, the last two paragraphs, which both start off "When
the Rules defining...", support my interpretation that the Rule is talking
about creation by the Rules, not just continued existence.

I agree that this is the way they *should* work.  However, I think making a
distinction between entities that are defined directly by the Rules and
entities that are defined under the authority of the rules is a useful one. 
But this distinction would make sense as two sub-classes of Nomic Entities.

I still think my interpretation is more correct than the one above.  Note the
phrase "only existing by virtue of the Rules defining them to exist".  Nowhere
is there a Rule defining the existence of Morendil's new currencies, only Rules
which allow Morendil to define (create) them.

You may *call* it whatever you like.  You may *name* it Sneezy
only if no other Nomic Entity has that name.  (Recall the CFJ 803

But those are the Rules defining them. Not in the sense of "this is what
they're called, these are their properties" but in the sense of "Currencies
exist. They can be transferred, they can be minted by players, etc." If you
were to change the rules defining Currencies, you would also change the
effects of Morendil's currencies, even to the extent that Morendil and the
Misanthropists had no control over them. Morendil, of course, does not have
the same sort of power. This is what I'm saying -- the Rules define the
continued existence and properties of a Player-minted currency, even if the
Player is the one who decides to use that backing to make their own Currency.

I tend to think that an entity owes its existence to the Rules if the
repeal of one or more Rules would cause it to cease to exist.  In my
opinion, this is the case for Currencies minted under the authority of
the Rules: the repeal of the Rule defining Currencies would cause them
to cease to exist, or at least to cease to have meaningful existence.

Not that I can think of.  The individual Powers were not themselves
minted as Currencies separate from the general Currency of Power.
There was no Currency "Power of Quiet Cards"; rather, there was a
Currency called "Powers", the units of which were given various
properties beyond those consequent to their status as units of
Currency.

I never liked that, by the way; it interfered with the general
principle that units of Currency are fungible.  Clearly, the units of
the Currency Powers were not fungible.

Even so, "Powers" and "Power" aren't the same thing, and furthermore,
being known as something and being named something are not necessarily
the same thing, either.

Aaaarghh.... Error! Error! Error! I now see that these should have been
issued by the Assessor, not by me. My excuses. Luckily this means the texts
above simply are not Payment Orders, or at least not executed payment orders,
so noone is obliged to take any action. Again my excuses.

The sense of "this is what they're called, these are their properties" is the
sense that I interpret the phrase "Rules defining them".  I agree with
everything else here, except that first sentence.  The Rules define the class
"Currencies" and the properties of Currencies and allow Morendil to define new
entities of type Currency.  IMO still, those Rules don't define Morendil's
currencies, they just define the class that Morendil had to use.  This
interpretation still makes everything else that you said above true, because if
the Rules change the properties of a defined class, that will affect all
instances of entities of that class.

Yes, but it all get's back to how you interpret that phrase "only existing by
virtue of the Rules defining it to exist" in R1586.  It's true, Currencies
minted under the authority of the Rules can't exist without the Currency Rules,
and would cease to have meaningful existence if the Currency Rules were
repealed.  And if the first sentence ended at "... without the Rules", I would
agree that Morendil's currencies are Nomic Entites.  But I still think it's too
much of a stretch to say that the Currency Rules themselves *define* any
particular Currency.  The Currency Rules could be in place without there being
any Currencies at all - without other Rules, or other actions by certain
Players, no Currencies would be defined to exist anywhere.  I really can't see
how you can interpret "Rules defining it to exist" as meaning anything other
than there must be some Rule or Rules that explicitly define "it".

Neither of these orders is necessary; these awards arose prior to the
adoption of Proposal 3533, and should be reported as transfer under
the Rules prevailing at the time.

Interesting; it appears that you are correct, although I did not
intend for this to be the case.  I'll have to look into this.  I
would have prefered this to work like Infractions and have the Order
exist regardless as to whether it should have been executed by that
Player or not, using the dispute mechanism to dispose of improperly
executed Orders.  But I apparently got talked into changing things
around so this was not the case.
