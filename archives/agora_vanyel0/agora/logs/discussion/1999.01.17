> Protoposal  - Commodities
> 
> Create a rule with the following text.

Well... I have a number of comments on the technical aspects of the 
Proposal, but first of all I want to question its motivation? What
sort of Commodities did you have in mind to implement? How are they
going to be different from Currencies? I do not see much in the
proto as it stands which makes Commodities much different from 
Currencies.

I doubt you will get much support for this idea until you also come
up with a practical and interesting use for it. Otherwise it is 
just extraneous clutter in the Ruleset, which we have enough of
already.

Okay, now to the nitty-gritty. 

First of all, yes it should be several rules, not just one big one.
Just as the Currency system is spread over several rules. It makes
it easy to refer to the particular part you want.

Why such an elaborate system for trading? Why can't it work just like
currency transfers? Why confine deals to being made in terms of 
Commodities? Can't I trade my commodities for VTs, or political favours?
Why not let the deals be done priavtely, and just regulation the final
procedure of transfer? It seems to work fine for Currency deals.

How are Commodities created and destroyed? 

The answers to a lot of these questions would, I imagine, be more
clear if we had a concrete example of what Commodities would be used
for. There's really not much point in trying to build a general system
before you have a use for it. You would be much better off to wait until
there were two or three Commodity-like things in the game, and then
try to find their common elements, and converting them into a general
model. A general model isn't much use on its own, or even with just 
one example. Why is there no general model that covers Kudo-like 
entities, for example? The answer is simple: there is only one Kudo-like
entity, that is the Kudo itself. There is no advantage to having a 
general system.

Not that I want to discourage you - it was a good proposal on the whole.
Well written with thought clearly given to making a workable system.
Just not very interesting on its own. Keep working at it.

>What sort of Commodities did you have in mind to implement?


I should have made the general idea behind the proto clearer.  The idea 
behind the rules would be to create a base, so that rules concerning the 
creation and use of commodities could be created later.  Commodities 
would relate to natural resources, products and consumables in real 
life. 

At this point I should say the basic problem is if commodities should 
have a serious affect on all of Agora.  Or just something which is fun 
for those who want to do it (see later).

The first type of commodity entity, I planned would be plebes.  Little 
people who would be owned, and die fairly meaninglessly.  Although it 
could get complicated, exactly how they would be created and destroyed.  
Though that could be arranged easily.

In general though there could be any sort of commodities, from oil (if 
somebody really wants to be boreing, (ha ha)). Houses, cities, land, 
grass, cows, sheep (possibly that gave to big an incite to how my mind 
works), just about anything would be possible and I’m sure people could 
come up with better and wittier ideas than I’ve written here.

All of these though I think would come under the just for fun rather 
than serious.  It could be that commodities would be a sort of light 
relief, but in the general style of all nomics they would be what people 
made them.


>How are they going to be different from Currencies?

Commodities I think would have to separate from currencies, it would be 
silly to have a Mint and a Recordkeepor for each commodity, and you 
don’t go minting plebes, coal or suchlike.  They would be created and 
destroyed in different ways which just wouldn't work if they were 
currencies.


>Why such an elaborate system for trading? 

Yeah, I guess it’s a bit dumb.  I just started writing and got carried 
away I guess, I simpler system would be a lot better.  Which would allow 
free trading just as long as it would be clear who owns what, as with 
currency transfers.


>How are Commodities created and destroyed?

I realize now if there that if there were separate rules for the 
creation and destruction of units of each commodity that this would 
quickly build up and get messy.  However, I think this could be got 
around.  Have one record and report (from the Storemaster) of how each 
commodity is created and destroyed rather than actual rules.  This would 
need a change in the proto about the creation of new commodities but it 
shouldn’t be too hard to fix.


>There's really not much point in trying to build a general system 
before you have a use for it.

I think that there is a need for a general system, as long as it is set 
out clearly enough.  This would work better than if commodities were 
just set up randomly, and also would save making the ruleset more 
complicated.

Perhaps that some sort of SLC could be set up with a few commodities.  
It would let people, find out about the system, and use it in a safe and 
separate environment from the fullset of rules.  Hopefully people would 
be interested and have a look in, if people didn’t care though they 
could just ignore it.

This would fit in well with the just for fun type of idea.  However, in 
this case there would be very little need to trade political favors or 
VT’s for commodities.


>Not that I want to discourage you.

I will not be discouraged… Never, ever, ever…and cheers for the advice 
Blob.

Good on you for having a go at writing a Proposal. I'll read it later
and pass on any comments I have. But you needn't worry about having to
make a Proposal immediately. You have 2 months' exemption from the Duty
to Propose as a New Player. See R1865, 1676.

That's true in the sense that, if my CFJ is TRUE, then you would need to
know what it means to deliver a collection of text to the PF in order to
know what you have to do to submit a Proposal. But Ørjan could very well
judge that the CFJ is TRUE, accepting my argument that submission of a
Proposal requires delivery of a collection of text to the PF (which is
all that the Statement alleges), *without* making a ruling about exactly
what constitutes delivery of a message to the PF.

It's possible that there is no conflict between the provisions, although
this may have some unexpected effects. R1007 states that:

      At the beginning of each month, the Registrar shall pay out to
      each Player the designated Salary for each Office that Player has
      held for a total of at least 12 days in the preceding month.

      There is a Basic Officer Salary, equal to a number of Voting
      Tokens, the level of which is set by the Chancellor, as
      described in other Rules.  Salaries are permitted to be
      expressed in terms of the Basic Salary.  Unless otherwise
      specified, the Salary for an Office shall be equal to the Basic
      Salary.

A typical represntative of the group of Rules listed above, R559, states
that:

      There shall exist the Office of Registrar.  The Registrar shall
      receive a weekly salary equal to 1.5 times the Basic Officer
      Salary.

The last Rule we need to have a look at before proceeding is R1854:

      The Chancellor can set the level of the Basic Officer Salary
      by announcing in the Public Forum that e is doing so, provided
      that e announces a value between 0 VTs and 8 VTs inclusive,
      that e makes the announcement before the 25th day of the month,
      and that the Basic Officer Salary has not already been set by a
      similar such announcement earlier in the month.

The surprising thing that I notice about these Rules is that nowhere
does it actually say that the Basic Officer Salary is a monthly salary.
The first paragraph of R1007 says that the "designated Salary" for each
Office should be paid at the beginning of the month. The BOS itself is
simply defined to be "equal to a number of Voting Tokens", a number
which, according to R1854, the Chancellor can set once per month. That
seems to me to be consistent with the possibility that Salaries are
earned weekly (but paid monthly), and this may indeed be the situation
that now obtains.

Chancellor Andre has just set the BOS to be equal to 1 VT. So R559
effectively says that the Office of Registrar shall receive a weekly
salary of 1.5 VTs. R1007 (para. 1) could therefore be interpreted as
requiring the Registrar to pay himself and the other Officers eir
accumulated weekly Salaries at the beginning of the month. It may be
that my original reaction was correct, although for the wrong reasons,
and that a flood of VTs will come into circulation at the beginning of
February. Of course, we could take action before then to avert this.

To my way of thinking, a really complete solution woukld tackle the
problem at its source, by amending the definition of the BOS to be "equal
to a number of Voting Tokens, to be paid to an Officer on a monthly
basis as remuneration for eir services to the game." It would also
contain special provisions to negate the effect of the inflated weekly
Salaries which are now being accumulated by all Officers, and the
Distributor.

The Distributor is a special case, by the way - e is to be paid at the
end of the week, regardless of R1007. Registrar Andre, please take note.

There is a subtlety there, however... you used "received in" rather than
"received by" or "delivered to" in the Statement.  The recipient is
missing, but can hardly be anything but the subscribers.

Greetings,

I think your CFJ boils down to asking whether a collection of text
which has not been "received in the Public Forum" (whatever that
means) has not been "delivered to the Public Forum".  You are
therefore asking Oerjan to construe both of these phrases, and decide
whether the former negative is necessarily implied by the latter.

The rule as written certainly has its problems, but some amended version
of it might work, even in Agora. Self-amendment is, at least legally,
unproblematic under Agoran rules, so my sketch (and it is just a sketch)
for such a provision something like:

      Upon appropriate notification of the Rulekeepor by AckaNomic (or
      its representative) of an AckaNomic amendment to the AckaNomic
      equivalent of this Rule, the Rulekeepor shall publish this
      notification as soon as possible in the Public Forum. This
      publication has the effect of causing this Rule to amend itself as
      indicated in the AckaNomic notification. However, under no
      circumstances is this paragraph to be amended by these, or any
      other means.

Obviously, "appropriate notification" needs further elaboration (inter
alia, to satisfy the requirements for precision in Agoran R1339), as
does "AckaNomic equivalent of this Rule". The last sentence is probably
not enough, but something like it will be necessary, perhaps borrowed
from Agora's old Frankenstein Monster Rule, which contained similar
provisions which seemed to work quite well.

At any rate, the problems, while considerable, do not seem to me to lie
with Agora's strictures on Rule Changes.

The second and third sentences of the second paragraph have to me a
faint smell of inconsistency about them. Say a proposal to amend the
Rule passes in Acka. The second sentence seems to say that this causes
the Rule to be amended both in AckaNomic and in Beserker Nomic. But then
the third sentence seems to deny this by saying that the change does not
happen until it is reported in Beserker Nomic.

Besides this problem with inconsistent timing, the rule seems destined
to create procedural tangles. For example, if Acka amends the rule, who
in Beserker Nomic is required to report this change? And what if
Berserker Nomic simply declines to report any Ackan amendments? By the
third sentence, this would appear effectively to block any Ackan
amendments (and of course the same is true in the other direction).

Yes, but again, Ørjan could hold that "delivered" implies "received" and
hence that "not received" implies "not delivered", and he could do so
just on the basis of the ordinary meanings of those words, without
considering the meaning of "delivered to the PF".

What I'm really trying to say is that Ørjan could deliver a Judgement on
this CFJ without deciding possibly tougher cases which the CFJ does not
address, e.g., the case of a message which reaches gecko, but goes no
further than that, say, due to an error in the configuration files for
the mailing lists.

While you're about it, you might also want to allow the Chancellor to
set BOS values more than once a month. A lot can happen in a month, and
you don't want to be stuck with bad decisions made at the beginning of
the month.

"Ackanomic equivalent of this Rule" would be a very interesting point 
for interpretation. I can imagine all manner of problematic situations.
It's the classic "do this" problem from Hofstadter. If a human being 
says to an elephant "Do this." and points to eir nose with eir finger,
what should the elephant do? What if it was a three-headed alien, instead
of an elephant?

Say we agreed that Rule XYZ was the "Ackanomic equivalent of this Rule".
Then another rule was created, rule ABC that had text identical to rule
XYZ - which is the equivalent rule now? Maybe it would still be XYZ, but
what if XYZ was then radically changed so that it no longer resembled
the Agoran Rule in any way. Is it still the "Acka equivalent"? Or is Rule
ABC now a closer equivalent?

What if Rule XYZ is not just amended, but repealed? What if it is 
renumbered?

Another interesting situation would be this:

What if Acka and Agoran amend their rules simultaneously to different texts,
vis:

Agoran Rule:

  The password is "sibboleth".

Ackan Rule:

  The password is "shibboleth".

The respectively Rulekeepors notify each other of the changes, and announce
them in the respective fora. Now each rule self-amends thus:

Agoran Rule:

  The password is "shibboleth".

Ackan Rule:

  The password is "sibboleth".

Now, once again the Rulekeepors will have to communicate this amendment
to their counterparts, who announce it, and self-amendment happens again:

Agoran Rule:

  The password is "sibboleth".

Ackan Rule:

  The password is "shibboleth".

And so on, and so on, and so on...

Perhaps we should give to the Distributor an explicit responsibility to
do what e reasonably can to ensure that messages intended for the PF
reach their destination. This would connect up the decision in CFJ 752
with my practice of forwarding on messages trapped by gecko for one or
another reason, and provide a legal basis for treating such forwarded
messages as having been delivered to the PF.

Of course, the Distributor need not be a Player, so such a provision
would only operate when e was.

According to my analysis, Officers are now earning 1 VT/week, which they
will be paid at the beginning of Februrary. The Distributor is earning 1
VT/week, which should be paid weekly.

Or we could require that a non-Player Distributor agree to be bound by 
that provision prior to accepting that position.  I see nothing in the 
Rules that prohibits the Rules from having jurisdiction over
non-Players.  (The argument that Rule 101 limits jurisdiction to
Players is not supported by its text.)

It's far less clear what the salary of Officers whose salary is not
specified as "weekly" is.  Rule 1007 says "equal to the Basic Salary", 
but the frequency of payment is unclear.
