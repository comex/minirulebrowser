I agree with that entirely; I am merely concerned that 206 might
possibly not leave us that option. I am not yet fully convinced that
Rule 206 works in the way I worked out during our recent
discussions, which you agreed with but I thought was overly 
interpretative.

BTW, however, I just sent elJefe a Judgement of FALSE on 1087, but
which I myself Appealed. That hasn't been published yet - I'm
beginning to wonder if elJefe *was* CotC when I sent that in...

This information is in the Registrar's report.  elJefe delegated CotC
to General Chaos until midnight today.  Of course, GC removed himself
from Office by going on Hold, but if you submitted before then, then
sending it to elJefe was no good.

What do you mean 'fellow Justices'? You will not be sitting on the board
of appeals. Rule 911 (excerpt):


"     A Player is ineligible for selection if any of the following is
      true:

      (...)

      iii) E has been Judge in the matter the Board is to consider."

Oh, interesting - I was under the impression that Judges could be 
Justices, as I was selected some time ago as both Judge and Justice 
on some CFJ. Was this a bug that was since fixed, or was that 
previous occurrence owing to unusual circumstances ? I forget...

Actually, I agree with you here.  The text distributed was an unambiguous
reference to the original proposal, especially since the typo was of such a
minor nature.  If we were to use common sense, it should fall under R754.
<<

I agree that the precision required for proposals is unpleasant,
especially in the present situation.

But think of what happens if we allow the promotor to introduce small
variations into proposals: we'll have to define or fight over what
"small" is, there will be a conflict between what the original
proposal wanted to do and what happens (because proposals take effect
"as voted upon" - or we have to abolish this principle) - all
alternatives to complete and consistent nitpickyness in this area open
up plenty of possibiliies for abuse. While such abuse may be fun to
play out, I'm still not sure we want it.

But I think there is Game Custom to the contrary-- enough so that
we have to have an explicit exceptions in the rules to prevent
proposal distributions from becoming Proposals.  I'm thinking of
our first few Internomic Referenda, which spawned Proposals in Agora
despite the Ambassador's intent. . .

I think it is a reasonable interpretation to say that it was distributed
*after* you became Wizard, since it does not specify which time you became
Wizard that it has to be after.

Well, my interpretation of using R754 would be to make the original version
(the "real" Proposal) the one that takes effect, since it is to that version
that the "typo" version is an unambiguous reference.  I think this would be a
reasonable way to handle things as long as the original version was
communicated in the PF prior to the mangled distributed version.  This would
prevent abuses by the Promotor.  But I'm afraid, as the Rules stand, Kolja and
Morendil? are right - this would fall afoul of R107's "must guide play in the
form it was voted on".

I would definitely oppose any legislation which would have the 
potential effect of having Proposals become adopted that Players 
hadn't seen the complete and exact text of beforehand.

I am in complete agreement with the point Kolja made, that a 'minor' 
mistake is a matter of appreciation. Imagine the following Proposal, 
as submitted :

P4000 - Upon passage of this Proposal, the Assessor's Salary becomes 
55 VTs.

Let's assume that this is the Proposer's own typo - but that a 
further typo, this time by the Promotor, 'mangles' this to

P4000* - Upon passage of this Proposal, the Assessor's Salary becomes
5 VTs.

Now, this would make a *very* serious difference to me; I would be 
likely to Vote FOR P4000*, or at least declare Presence on it, while 
I would be inclined to Vote, say, 2A on P4000.

Unlikely scenario ? Perhaps. Unlikely events happen, given enough 
events. Certainly Agora has seen a number of unlikely circumstances.

In the case of 3710/3710*, the situation is not as clear cut - the 
position that "<text" is an unambiguous synonym for "<text>" is 
barely tenable, provided that context makes it real clear where you 
are to stop. However, I would definitely favor a Judgement that did 
not allow such a possibly damaging precedent to stand; damaging 
because of the possiblity of scenarios such as the above.

> This would prevent abuses by the Promotor.  But I'm afraid, as the

Oh, definitely - and the Rule Change substituting <proposal number>
doesn't work. But that is of minor importance; that issue would have 
been raised had Swann, rather than Blob, been the originator of that 
typo. Typos in Proposals, per se, are nothing new.

On the other hand, I don't think the situation with 3710/3710* has
any precedent.

Yup, that's why I said the correct version needs to be posted to the PF first.

In this case, IMO, it's more than just "barely tenable" when overall context is
taken into account (context, context, contxt  8)).  We all *know* that "<text"
was meant to be "<text>".

> However, I would definitely favor a Judgement that did

Again, I have been convinced that you are right in this case.  Such a judgement
under the current Rules would set a dangerous precedent.  This would require
legislative remedy.

No; probably Scott was CotC-Delegate. but Jeff is now CotC again,
and although the Judgement is late, if you send it to him now,
he can probably still accept it.

Oddly, Rule 833, the current version of which I wrote, specifies
that the reward for getting a Proposal adopted is to be paid as
soon as possible after the beginning of the Nomic Week after the
one in which the Proposal is adopted. The first batch of Proposal
was adopted in the previous week, so I could issue POs for them.
The POs for the other batch will have to wait until next week.

I have no idea why I didn't just say that the Assessor should issue
the POs as soon as possible after the Proposal is adopted, provided
that no other such payment has already been made in that week.

Proto-Proposal
Tweak R833

[Comment: the current version of R833 makes the timing of the POs
awkwards for the Assessor, who may have to refer back to previous
Reports to determine which Proposals were adopted in the previous
week.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 833 have its Title changed to
"Reward for Getting a Proposal Passed" and that it be amended
to read:

      As soon as possible after an Interested Proposal submitted by a
      Player is adopted, the Assessor shall pay out two Voting Tokens
      to that Player, with the proviso that no more than one such
      payment shall be made to any Player under the authority of this
      Rule for Proposals distributed at the same time.

I'm not sure how long ago that was, and whether 1483 then had the
same form it does now.
