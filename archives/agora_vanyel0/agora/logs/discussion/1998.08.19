I agree with Morendil. Two Rules that impose signficantly different time
requirements on performing the same action must be regarded as being
conflict with each other. Consider the situation after I have failed to
perform the action after 4 days. The according to one of the Rules I
have failed to perform as the Rules require that I do, but according to
the other I have not. Only one of these claims can be true, so the Rules
are in conflict in the situation which is of interest.

So, let's pursue elJefe's point about higher Powered Rules claiming to
defer to lower Powered Rules. Simplifying a little, It now appears that
we have 5 Rules to consider:

R1686 (Power=1): New Officers must Report by the end of the Week.
R1585 (Power=2): New Officers must Report asap.
R1023 (Power=2): asap = within 1 week. This Rule defers to R1686.
R1482 (Power=3): Higher Power takes precedence over lower Power.
R1030 (Power=3): In conflicts b/w Rules of equal Power, use explicit
                 precedence/deference claims to resolve the conflict,
		 then Rule Numbers.

ElJefe has noticed that when R1023 claims to defer to R1686, this is not
the kind of deference claim alluded to by R1030, since R1030 governs
only conflicts between Rules of equal Power, which Rules 1023 and 1686
are not. Still, the deference claim is there in Rule. What does it mean?

Here's what I claim it means: 

      In the case of a conflict between the requirements of R1023 and
      R1686, the requirements of R1686 take precedence. 

But now we need to take into effect the claims of R1482. These have not
really been examined before in this discussion. What this Rule says
about this particular case is this:

      In the case of a conflict between the requirements of R1023 and
      R1686, the requirements of R1023 take precedence.

Hence, there is a hitherto unnoticed conflict between Rules 1023 and
1482, on the question of how disputes between R1023 and lower Powered
Rules are to be resolved. R1023 claims to be able to defer to such Rules
in the case of a conflict. R1482 denies that R1023 has this ability.
But of course, R1482 resolves this conflict, in its own favour. So R1023
cannot, in fact, defer to Rules of lower Power. This result generalizes:
Rules of higher Power cannot defer to Rules of lower Power if conflict
between their provisions arises, unless the higher Powered Rule takes
precedence of R1482.

I think this principle is important enough to be worth enshrining
Judicially. I'll make a CFJ.

Ah, but in this case, the penalties were assessed incorrectly: you had
forgotten about the previous week's Speaker Transition, and incorrectly
reported Blob for Failure to Report. Swann resigned as Scorekeepor on
July 11, and you didn't get around to correcting your mistake until
after a full week had passed from that time. I quote from the Herald's
Report:

Date: Sun, 19 Jul 1998 21:51:58 +0100

    Registrar Michael vacates the Failure to Report penalties assessed
    to Blob and reissues them to Steve.

For instance. I disagree, however, with the interpretation you favor
that would lead us into a tangled web of precedence.

I contend that Rule 1686 is only concerned with the performance of
Officers under normal circumstances, and that Rule 1585 is
complementary to it rather than conflicting in the usual meaning.
Rule 1585 not only specifies a timing, it also *absolves* the former
holder of the Office of the responsibility to perform the action
that was required of em under 1686, and imposes a *new* duty upon the
new holder.

Invoking possible conflicts between 1023 and the precedence Rules
themselves is probably moot. If there is a conflict, it is directly
between 1686 and 1585, and 1585 wins it by virtue of higher Power;
and it is over the attribution of the duty, not its timing requirements,
that the Rules conflict.

I believe you are mistaken. R1023 explicitly states that:

      ...this Rule defines the latest time at which actions to be
      performed "as soon as possible" may be performed without
      incurring a Penalty.  

As you note, R1023 then goes on immediately to qualify this:

      It takes precedence over other Rules which define a later latest
      time for the performance of these actions. Other Rules may impose
      earlier latest times, and if so, this Rule defers to them.

However, as I have just argued (and CFJed on), R1023 cannot defer to
lower Powered Rules in a conflict without conflicting with R1482, which
conflict it loses. So the situation as I see it is this:

1. R1023 does define the latest time at which actions to be performed
asap may be performed without a penalty.

2. R1023 therefore does conflict with R1686, which attempts to define an
earlier latest time after which performance of an action (Reporting) is
penalizable.

3. R1023 attempts to defer, in two places, to R1686.

4. These attempts fail, because R1482 forces higher Power Rules to take
precedence over, rather than defer to, lower Power Rules.

Can you explain in more detail how you arrive at the conclusion that
R1686 is only concerned with the performance of Officers under normal
circumstances? R1686 says that:

      The holder of an Office for which there is an Official Report
      shall maintain all information in the Report, and shall post it to
      the Public Forum at least once every Nomic Week.

I can't see anything there that supports the idea that R1686 does not
apply to new Office holders.

As far I can tell, based on the text of R1686 given above, there is no
disagreement between Rules 1585 and 1686 concerning the attribution of
the duty. The two Rules are agree that the old Officer holder is
absolved of any duties, and they both claim that new Officer holder is
required to publish a Report. They just disagree about the timing
requirements.

If a rule explicitly says of itself that it is deferring to another
rule, how can you argue that the two are in conflict?  A conflict
happens when rules disagree.  Here, because R1023 says that it gives
up in the face of a different opinion, there isn't any conflict.

One rule says "X!"  Another says, "As long as no-one else has any
opinions, Y, but oh, you say X, OK then, X it is."  

I don't believe this qualifies as a conflict because you should be
reading the deferring rule for its full effect before invoking R1482.

Yes, that's right, and then I assessed you once more for FtR on the
25th of July.  This second one was for failure to report during the
week ending on the 19th, the previous was for failure to report on the
week up to the 12th. 

The Registrar's Report tabulates all the POs I've issued.  Here is the
extract from the RIPO (Indulgence) listing.

RIPO  22      : 18/07/98 : Blob failing to report (V)
RIPO  23      : 19/07/98 : Steve failing to report
RIPO  24      : 25/07/98 : Steve failing to report

The (V) indicates that the order was vacated. 

Michael.

The former holder is absolved of eir duty by 1585. Why not take
'absolved' as meaning that the duty is considered to have been
fuliflled ? That's a 'natural' reading of the word 'instead' in 1585;
it essentially says, 'in such exceptional circumstances, it is this
Rule, not 1686, which governs'.

Thus, in any given Nomic Week where an Office change hands, the
reporting obligation of 1686 is fulfilled by the former holder, while
the new holder is only under an obligation under 1585; it's just that
1585 specifies that these duties are the same that applied to the
former holder, including the obligation to report. This is simple and
consistent, and I think you (Steve et al) are seeking complexity for
its own sake. :)

Are these in conflict?

  Rule A:  Each player must vote in a Referendum within 5 days after it
begins.
  Rule B:  Each Officer must vote in a Referendum within 3 days after it
begins.

According to Rule A you have satisfied Rule A's requirements.  According to
Rule B you have not satisfied Rule B's requirements.

It depends on the phrasing.  Rule 1023 actually appears to be worded to
define a time within which actions may be performed without penalty, and so
does give rise to a conflict as I outlined.

In my opinion, yes, barring any saving language elsewhere.

I don't believe we can interpret deference clauses in that way.
Deference and precedence are converse relations, logical mirror images
of each other. Therefore, if we interpret deference claims as actually
making conflicts disappear, rather than as telling us how to resolve
conflicts which nevertheless exist despite the existence of a deference
clause, then we have to treat precedence claims in the same way. And we
don't do this. If we did, we would have to say that the Rules, all
things considered, are never in conflict with each other (except in rare
cases of paradoxical chains of precedence relations).

Say A and B are Rules of equal Power, and that they conflict, and
neither contains precedence or deference claims. Then Number resolves
the conflict. Now add to A a claim of precedence over B. We don't say
that the conflict is made to disappear by the addition of the precedence
clause. The conflict remains, and is resolved in favour of A. But since
precedence and deference are converse relations, this situation is
logically identical to the one where, instead of adding a precedence
clause to A, we add a deference clause to B. So in that case, too, we
must say that the conflict remains, but is resolved in favour of A.

Given just that bare set of assertions, I think it's possible there is
no conflict. Other Rules explaining in more detail what is meant by
'must' might have the effect of making the claims conflict. But in any
case I think we've agreed that in the case of Rules 1023 and 1686, their
respective wordings guarantee that they do conflict.

I worried about this when I first saw it, and now I think I see why.
Look at R1550:

      Any Official Document (as specified in other Rules) may be
      ratified by the operation of an adopted Proposal (but no other
      sort of instrument).  The instrument must specify an Official
      Document (as specified in other Rules) which is subject to
      ratification.

It's true that R1791 say that:

      Any Officer who holds an Office in Normal Fashion can Ratify an
      Official Report Without Objection, provided the following
      conditions hold;

But that just brings R1791 into conflict with R1550, a conflict which
it loses. Ratification Without Object is therefore broken. I believe
that Swann proposed to fix it recently, but this was one of the worthy
Proposals which failed Quorum during the ban on Presence.
