The main reason for this inflation in the number of VTs is that new VTs are
being created faster than they are destroyed.  So why not simply legislate
that the rates of creation and destruction are equal?
Why not just have the number of VTs in existence be based on the number of
players, say 10 or 15 per player.  VTs are created at registration (say 5 in
the player's possession and the rest in the bank) and an equal number are
destroyed at deregistration (if the player holds an insufficient number then
the bank must make up the shortfall).  Any time the bank hold insufficient
VTs to pay its debts (or to meet a destruction quota) a tax must be levied.

Worse yet; what if I pay for my votes on a batch of proposals; they
all pass/fail, and then I vacate the TOs to the Bank?  
Rule 1732 "Satisfaction of Payment Orders" doesn't seem to allow for a
once satisfied Payment Order to be re-instated if the satisfying
Transfer Order is subsequently vacated.

Though 1585 takes precedence by virtue of its lower number, I don't
believe it conflicts with 1686, and that the penalties in 1686 still
apply.  In particular, 1585 says:
  
  Officers shall perform required actions asap.

Rule 1686 says:
  
  If an Officer fails to report in a Nomic Week, then they are liable
  to the Infraction of failing to report.

My claim is that a requirement to do things asap in no way guarantees
that you are permitted to take as long as a week.  Other rules may
step in and make things worse.  What's more, and this really seems to
clinch things to my mind, R1023, the definition of "As soon as
possible" says :

      [This rule] takes precedence over other Rules which define a
      later latest time for the performance of these actions.  Other
      Rules may impose earlier latest times, and if so, this Rule
      defers to them.

Even more, it then says: 

      This Rule defers to Rules which describe the responsibilities of
      Players who are On Hold, and to any Rules which impose different
      requirements on the timing of Official Duties.

Though it's probably not a good thing, this seems to be the current
situation, and I will be denying any COEs that come my way on this
matter. 

Michael.

In my opinion, the Rules are silent on the matter, and any conflict
shall be resolved on an ad hoc basis, on the same principles that
apply to within-Rule conflicts. Of course, in that case we have a
'natural' principle to guide us : generally, numberless Rules end up
higher- numbered than already-numbered Rules, thus a numberless
Rule should be considered, for the purpose of resolving a conflict,
equivalent to a higher-numbered Rule.

Though I do not deny you the right to call for Appeals on whatever
grounds you like, I'm curious as to whether or not you think there are
any flaws in my argument.

Indeed.  Obviously some solution is required; I can think of

Moreover, if CFJ 1090 is overturned, and 3710 passed, then I analyze the
situation as follows:

(1.) Threat Trombone No. 5 succeeded in raising the Monument Rule to Power=7.

Reasons:
 * Rule 1692 (Power=1) says it can't (rule powers must be between 1 and 4).

 * Rule 1322 (Power=3) says it doesn't take effect (an instrument of Power
   4 cannot raise a Rule's power to 7)

 * The Trombone Rule (Power=4) says it _does_ take effect.

** The Trombone Rule takes precedence and has its way.  The Monument Rule
   does indeed have Power=7.


(2.)  Rule 1692 did not automagically change the Monument Rule back to Power=4.

Reason:
 * Rule 1322, which has precedence over 1692.


(2.) Chuck's counterscam failed to repeal the Monument Rule.

Reasons:
 * Rule 1836 (Power=1) says that the provisions of CS2 (an instrument
   of Power=5), take effect.

 * Rule 1322 (Power=3) says that the repeal provision does not take
   effect, since a Power=5 instrument cannot repeal a Power=7 Rule.

** In this case, Rule 1322 takes precedence over Rule 1836, and the
   repeal fails.


I await with interest the decision of the Appeals Tribunal.

The reason this still uses the old Zeitgeist rule is that the

Nope, never got them.
Oh well, it's not such a big deal.  I was just peeved that with one
sentance I wasn't in office long enough for a salary, but I still got
socked with the non-reporting requirement.

That is doubtful.  So far there is only one call for appeal of CFJ 1090.  I
think you need to just give it your best judgement...

>It would be a funny paradox to see CFJ1089 judged false while the

Well, then I suppose 1089 would simply be appealed, probably landing before
the same appeals tribunal.

How, exactly, will Indelible Voting increase VT expenditure? 

Personally, I've never liked the indelible voting idea, myself.

This I do *not* like at all. We all saw how many proposals failed in the
early days of paying for votes because not enough people voted for them.
The problem with doing this now is that VT income is *too* small to
support it; if we eliminated Presence, Players would basically need to
vote on every proposal for any of them to pass, which almost none of us
can afford.

The reason why I found that getting rid of Presence is now possible is
Rule 1761, which allows the Speaker to waive Quorum for non-controversial
Proposals.  That would have to be a routine matter under such a system.

But the current VT environment might have become too scarce for that.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

I like this format for the Wizard's Report -- citing the proposal names next 
to the style awards makes it much easier to understand the comments.

Simply enough, as I posted to n-d a week or so ago, I believe that 
common sense dictates that what I distributed was "close enough" 
to P3710 to permit us to say that the proposal _was_ distributed, 
albeit with a typo in it. I see nothing in the rules to disallow this
point of view. I admit that "close enough" is a slippery slope, but
that's why we have the judgement system, to use our common sense to
interpret these things on a case by case basis. By judging 1089 and
1090 TRUE, I believe we have unnecessarily reinforced the (imho)
irritating custom of nit-pickiness in Agora.

I honestly doubt that there will be enough support to make the Appeals
take place, but I thought I might as well voice my protest.
