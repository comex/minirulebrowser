My opposition to the substantive law this proposal would enact

While I am not ideologically opposed to the proposal, I do agree with
the General here. All this stuffing around with asterisks seems very
ugly.

I don't see any other way to achieve what I'm trying to achieve here. If
you can, I'm all ears.

I'm surprised. The person who will actually have to implement the
procedure, ie Registrar Michael, evidently thinks it is quite elegant,
and supports it. Given the decision that the duty to propose ought to
cycle through a (subset of the) list of Players, without allowing
Players to manipulate their On Hold statuses to avoid incurring the
duty, the algorithm I have devised is about the simplest to be had, I
believe. Perhaps what you object to is the use of any algorithm at all.
But the only alternative I can think of would be to specify very
precisely the constraints the algorithm is to satisfy, and provide that
the Registrar may use any procedure that satisfies those constraints.
But I think any attempt to specify precisely enough what constraints the
algorithm is supposed to satisfy will be more complicated and
long-winded than the proto is alleged to be. Think, for example, about
all the constraints that are implied just by the simple provision that
the Registrar "shall maintain an alphabetically sorted list of Players":
this tells the Registrar that e can't use an arbitrary list ordered to
eir own liking, that e has to use the same list from week to week, what
e should do with new Players, and so on.

But, as I say, if you or any one else has a better idea (although I
hardly expect you to bother, since you hate the idea anyway), either for
a simpler algorithm, or a simpler way of doing things that doesn't
require describing an algorithm, I'll be glad to hear it.

My esthetic hackles are raised more by the explicit demands for the
use of particular characters that seem tied to the present customs
regarding Registrar's Reports which may very well not be the law.
There is no reason why the Registrar (or whoever) should have to use
H's and *'s; e could just as easily use +'s and -'s, or any other
notation which was clear and unambiguous.  The Rule you suggest too
closely ties the representation of data with the data itself, which is
generally an error at least of style, if not of substance.

They aren't tied to any customs regarding Registrar's Reports at all.
The Registrar could completely change his way of reporting which Players
are On Hold and the operation of the procedure would be utterly
unaffected.

OK, I see what you mean, but think about it from my point of view. This
is exactly the kind of problem I was talking about. If I *don't* specify
exactly what marks the Registrar is to use, then I have to describe
their functions extremely precisely, or the instructions to the
Registrar will be too vague to determine an effective procedure. And
describing their functions precisely is bound to be long-winded; here's
an attempt so you get the idea of what's involved:

      The Registrar shall choose two different distinguishing marks to
      appear next to names on the list: the first, called the Round
      Marker, indicates that the marked Player has been selected by the
      Registrar to submit a Proposal in accordance with this Rule during
      the current Round; the second, called the On Hold marker,
      indicates that the marked Player has missed being selected during
      the current Round as a result of being On Hold at the time when
      they would otherwise have been selected.

And then I'd have to go on and define exactly what a Round is. So, your
claim above that there is no reason why the Registrar should have to use
specific characters is not true: the reason is that specifying the
characters saves me space in which I would otherwise have to define the
constraints within which the Registrar is free to choose them.

The trouble with a rewards based solution is that we have good reason to
think that it won't be effective in encouraging people to take seriously
their duty to propose. For consider the reward for getting an InterNomic
Proposal adopted: 5 VTs, or 3 month's Salaries - an absurdly high
reward, and yet virtually no-one was inspired by it to actually submit
InterNomic Proposals. Yet if there had been a penalty for not doing so,
I feel pretty confident that we would have seen plenty of InterNomic
Proposals.

This may be in part because it is impossible to get an InterNomic
proposal adopted, between generalize InterNomic ennui and the
announced policy of the Patch to vote against every Proposal, or at
least against those proposed by Agora.  But I digress.

Well, I've had a good number of IN proposals adopted, and made good
money with the rewards.

Concerning the Pumpkins, they made it quite clear that their votes
were not directed against Agora, but that they wanted us to fall for
their claim that they were, to demonstrate our lack of humour, and our
general seriousness.

Nonsense. Kolja and I both managed to get IN Proposals adopted recently.

Proto-Proposal
A Duty to Propose

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "A Duty to Propose", be
created with the following text:

      Active Players not in their Grace Periods (henceforth in this
      Rule, 'Experienced Players') shall periodically incur a duty to
      submit a Proposal, as described in this Rule.

      The Registrar shall maintain an alphabetically sorted list of all
      Players, annotated as described in this Rule. For the purposes of
      making the annotations, the Registrar shall choose two different
      distinguishing marks to serve as the Proposal marker and the On
      Hold marker used below. The Registrar shall delete any
      deregistered Players, and add any newly registered Players, before
      performing the procedure below.

      As soon as possible after the beginning of the Week, the Registrar
      shall perform the following procedure, which accomplishes the
      selection of the Experienced Player(s) (usually there will be two,
      but occasionally there may be only one) to incur the duty to
      propose for that Week, the announcement of the names of those
      Players, and the updating of the list:

      (a) Experienced Players with an On Hold marker next to their names
      shall be selected before other Experienced Players. If there are
      more than two such Players, then the Registrar shall select the
      two highest on the list.

      (b) If, after selecting Experienced Players with an On Hold marker
      next to their names, there remain any places to be filled to bring
      the total number of Players selected for that Week to two, then
      the Registrar shall select the Experienced Player(s) highest on
      the list who do not have a Proposal marker next to their names. If
      there are not enough such Players, then only one Player is
      selected for that Week.

      (c) The Registrar shall then announce in the Public Forum the
      names of Players who have been selected for that Week. These
      Players have two weeks from the time of the Registrar's
      announcement to submit a Proposal. 

      (d) The Registrar shall then place a Proposal marker next to the
      names of the Players selected for that Week. If any of these
      Players had an On Hold marker next to their names, it shall be
      removed. 

      (e) If it is ever the case that all Experienced Players have a
      Proposal marker next to their names, then the Registrar shall place
      an On Hold marker next to the name of any Player who is On Hold
      and who does not have a Proposal marker next to eir name, and remove
      all Proposal markers from the list.

      As stated above, the Experienced Players selected by the Registrar
      each incur a duty to submit a Proposal within two weeks of the
      Registrar's announcement. Failure to do so is the Infraction of
      Failure to Propose, incurring a penalty of 1 Blot and 1 P-Note, to
      be detected and reported by the Registrar. The requirement to
      submit a Proposal placed upon a Player by this Rule lapses when
      the Player submits a Proposal, or when two weeks have elapsed from
      the time of the Registrar's announcement, whichever comes first.

There are simpler and more straightforward algorithms that accomplish almost
exactly the effect you are trying to achieve.  How about something like:

    Let there be a Property of Players known as their Bully Status (BS).
    A Player's BS is either Bullied or Unbullied.  All Players' initial
    BS is Unbullied.  The Registrar shall maintain a list of all
    Players' BS, ordered according to when each Player last proposed
    from least to most frequently.  This list is part of the Registrar's
    report.

    At the beginning of each Nomic week, the Registrar shall change the BS
    of the first Active Unbullied Player on the list to Bullied.

    When a Player comes off hold the Registrar shall immediately change
    the BS of the Player to Bullied if the following conditions are true:
        1)  The Player is the first Unbullied Player on the list.
        2)  The Player was on hold for a period of less than 1 week.

    Upon submission of a Proposal by a Bullied Player, the Registrar shall
    change that Player's BS to Unbullied.

    Any Player who is Bullied for 2 consecutive weeks commits the
    Infraction of Ignoring This BS, incurring a penalty of 1
    Blot and 1 P-Note, to be detected and reported by the Registrar.


I whipped this up fairly quickly so I'm sure it's not as well put together
as it could be, but I think this algorithm has several advantages.  First,
one only suffers this indignity if one doesn't propose reasonably often on
one's own. Second, if one goes on hold to avoid it, one must stay on hold a
whole week or immediately get hit with the obligation.  Third, I think it
adequately hints at my opinion of the whole idea.  :)

You still have the odd notion of putting "marks" next to "names",
which seems rather weird to me because names are not exactly entities
which have spatial location.  Why can't you phrase this in a way that
isn't dependent on scribbling stuff on a printed list?

The sarcasm aside, I like this more than my own version, and I will
attempt to precisify it.

I guess you mean the Salaries notice.

I don't think we ever did get around to closing the loophole
that the Trombone scam tried to exploit.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

ProtoProposal Chuck120.1
Trombone Concerto

I request that this Proposal have AI=3.

Rule 955 is amended by appending a paragraph reading

      A Proposal may not have its Voting Index set except
      as described in this Rule.  A Proposal may not be adopted
      (synonymous with the Proposal passing) except as described
      in this Rule.

A Rule shall be created with Power=3 and text as follows:

      Except as described in this Rule, no entity can set the Power
      of another entity to exceed the Power of the entity causing
      the Power to be so set.  A Rule may set the Power of an adopted
      Proposal, even exceeding the Power of the Rule, so long as the
      Power of the adopted Proposal does not exceed the Voting Index
      of that Proposal.

      No entity may destroy or repeal an entity with Power greater
      than its own.

While my initial reaction was to oppose the idea of force Proposals, I've
begun to reconsider.  Depending on what you come up with I might even vote
for it.
