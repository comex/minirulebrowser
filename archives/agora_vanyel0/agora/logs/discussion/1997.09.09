Is *that* how you mathematicians think we philosophers spend our time? :)
As far as I am concerned my answer to Chuck (which started this thread)
was supposed to show this his premises and mine weren't contradictory,
and that we shouldn't assume that they were.

And I'm still having trouble understanding you views concerning NW Game
3. Presumably one of the pair of answers <Blob won, Blob didn't win>
is the answer you think is absolutely correct. What features of
whichever answer it is are supposed to account for its absolute
correctness?

Why would he DENY the COE then?  The COE claims that he has to make one PO
for the three indulgences instead of three for one each... "...a PO shall
be executed ... for a number of Indulgences equal to the number of Blots
that player is to receive."  Is that not clear that you need to execute
only one PO for 3 Indulgences?

Um, I hate to spoil your fun, but this doesn't follow. What follows
from the above is that every penalized act or failure to act is a
Crime or an Infraction. It doesn't follow that every Infraction is
penalized act or failure to act. The existence of Infractions which
are status offenses is not ruled in or out by R1503.

Don't sweat it :)  I'm waiting on my indulgence to be payed out by the H.
Chancellor, and I was going to hand one of those over to Oerjan when I got
them, so I can just give that to you instead... assume Oerjan doesn't
transfer an indulgence back to you by then :)

Vir just takes Vlad's place.

Steve. What probably has happened, is that I accidentily replace Vlad by Vir
in the 'Judge' section instead of the 'Eligible' section, and then forgot
to add Steve as a Judge.

Good point.  Recommend changing the definition of Lawless to only
include Indulgence POs which are overdue.
<<

This still looks a bit like a one-off patch. But I definitly like it
better than the exception that Indulgence POs that were themselves a
PI penalty are not subject to PI penalties when they remain
unpaid. That would not only introduce more paperwork for the officers
concerned, as someone remarked, I also wouldn't like the game effect. 

As it is now, running into debt can lead to a negative feedback loop:
penalty Indulgence POs, more PI penalties. And I think that's quite
ok: it makes living in debt very uncomfortable and unstable, and if we
want to discourage debt, we should leave it at that.

<childhood memories>
We used to play Monopoly with the possibility to get credit from the
bank. To avoid overuse of this we introduced 10% interest rates to be
paid when the income was collected, so being in debt more than $40000
would need more interest payments than the regular income, starting a
downward spiral into bankruptcy. Voila: You can go into debt, but
don't overdo it or you'll be ruined anyway. More elegant than not
allowing debts at all or introducing artificial limitations, IMO.

What about some campaigning?

I'll start: I'd like to become CotC because 

- I want to make a contribution to Agora.

- I expect that the administrative work for the CotC will not be too
much, so I'll be able to deliver on time.

- Being a newbie to Nomics, I hope I'll be able to serve as a good
member of any board of appeal: I haven't had time (yet) to develop
much of a personal agenda, quirks or prejudice, so I hope to be able
to judge objectively and constructively.

This was a political braodcast brought to you by Kolja A., not
affiliated with any political party. We now return you to your
scheduled program, awaiting more commercials...

Let's for the sake of the argument grant that you are right. You will
then have to claim that what Rule 1713 defines as an Infraction is not,
in fact, the same kind of 'thing' (I'd rather avoid 'entity' now) that
1503 defines. More precisely, that what 1713 defines does not belong to
the class of 'things' that the Rules can, according to 1503, penalize
Players for.

Nor can we claim that Rule 1713, absent 1503, would be sufficient to 
establish the fact that a Player fulfilling its conditions is to be
subject to a penalty of 1 Blot, in the current meaning of having a
PO for 1 Indulgence assessed against them. Absent 1503, I believe
that "doing X is an Infraction bearing a penalty of 1 Blot" would
not sufficiently determine the procedure for assessing this penalty.

Thus, you seem to be claiming that Rule 1713 has the authority to
define (by defining its single instance) a new type of Infraction
not covered by Rule 1503, despite its being heavily dependent on
1503 for the application of its penalties; IOW, that 1713 acts as 
enabling legislation as much as 1503 in broadening what the term
'Infraction' covers to include "status offenses".

In my opinion, this amounts to the redefinition in 1713 of a term
that was previously defined by 1503. I'm extremely uncomfortable
with such a construction - though I recall that we never decided
that it was illegal for a Rule to redefine a term used in a higher-
precedence Rule (in fact, IIRC you argued that no general rule
could be defended and that all such occurrences should be decided
on a case-by-case basis).

Your interpretation of "such actions [...] are defined as [...]
Infractions" may be overly literal. Current usage of 'defined as'
seems to indicate a symmetry of its terms in some cases; Rule 452
has "a Vote Collector is defined as any Player to whom the Rules
give the responsibility of tallying votes". Would you claim that

Although I agree that most uses of the term "define" should be
interpreted 'symmetrically', I don't believe that the use in question
is such an instance.  This is because it isn't really a definition at
all, being an example of the claim that T = E1 or E2, where
  T = "such actions", E1 = "Crime", and E2 = "Infraction".

It's hard work to see that as a definition, for all that the phrase
uses the word "defined".  Rather I think it is simply a claim that
such actions will be classed as either Crimes or Infractions by other
rules. 

Michael.

I would not consider this to be a redefinition, but as an extension:
as a result, infractions are either, generically speaking, actions (or
failures to act), according to 1503; or they are instances of other
kinds of infractions introduced elsewhere, like n 1713.

Note that 1503 does not say "_Only_ such ... actions..." are crimes or
infractions; 1503 just starts a list of what infractions can be, and
other rules can add to that list. 1503 does not claim to give an
exhaustive definition of infractions.

One more time, before you lob it to the Courts with me barred as Judge.  8)

The 'cause' of the Infraction does not have to be considered to be any specific
Payment Order.  It is perfectly reasonable, metaphysically speaking, to
consider the proximal cause of the Infraction to be the failure to satisfy a
non-empty set of overdue POs within a certain period of time, without regard to
the actual contents of the set.

I tend to agree with you.  However, it was Andre who issued the Payment Orders
and it is up to im to deny or admit this claim.  The "Report" in Oerjan's
message refers to Andre's report of the infraction.

You can argue that both answers have equal a priori chance of being
correct, but you cannot therefore argue that both are correct.
Maybe the word "absolute" is not very well chosen.

Unfortunate choice of symbols - "=" is as symmetric as you get. If I
was sure of which charset to use I'd choose 'epsilon' in its meaning
of 'is a member of the set', but let's use << instead. Steve claims
that 1503 is stating "(A|~A) << {(C|I)}" i.e. "every act or failure
to act that the Rules can penalize is a member of the set comprising
all Crimes and all Infractions". (By the way, this is false. Rule 1594
penalizes Violation of SLCs without making it a Crime or an Infraction.
Then again, Rules don't have to be composed of true statements.)

Steve's construction of 1503 is descriptive, I think, whereas mine
is prescriptive.

> It's hard work to see that as a definition, for all that the phrase
> uses the word "defined".  Rather I think it is simply a claim that

IMHO that's turning things on their heads. The way I read 1503, it
works much like 1274 (Definition of Indices), i.e. defines an
abstract class of entities used elsewhere in the Ruleset in concrete
instances, rather than having itself any legal effects. It states what
Crimes and Infractions are and how they should in general be used by Rules
needing to penalize things. Other Rules then make use of that framework
by ascribing specific penalties to specific instances of the very general
class of things that 1503 says are Crimes and Infractions. IOW I read
it as a 'template' - many other concepts in the Ruleset work that way.

Now we've had several instances in the past of Rules defining a
template and later Rules using them in ways that didn't quite fit
the template - for instance Currencies, which must have MUQs, Mintors,
Names and whatnot - the question being, if some Rule or Rules attempt
to define a Currency without specifying a Mintor for it, is it still
a Currency ? I don't recall the detail of the arguments in that case,
but anyway there doesn't seem to be a general principle involved,
only case-by-case decisions.

I'm not sure what 1503 claims or doesn't claim - but it sure doesn't
look similar to Rules which provide for extension or refinement of
the concepts they define (such as Election & Referenda). And I don't
see the first paragraph of 1503 as "the start of a list" by any
stretch of the imagination. IMHO "an act or a failure to act" clearly
attempts to cover the totality of a class, not to cite a few instances
as representative of a larger class, which is what I'd consider to
be "the start of a list".

Ah, but are these the same as, or different from, 'failure to satisfy
POI00n from August 31 to September 7' ? Or, say, 'failure to satisfy
POI00n from Aug. 31, 23:59 GMT through Sep. 1, 0:01 GMT' ? If the same,
how can you talk of 'separate metaphysical concepts' - if different,
what can justify your treating a period of one Week lasting until the
end of the Week as special and separate from a period twice that
length, beginning a week earlier ? (And I won't be content with an
answer that ignores the fact that the Rules only care about what is
the case _at a particular point in time_, i.e. on Monday 0:00 GMT.)

However, and in addition to the metaphysical problem, a failure to
satisfy all POs overdue on Sep. 7 is also, in part, a failure to
satisfy all POs overdue on Aug. 31. Which is another reason for
looking to D.J.

I would say that each of your examples above are different metaphysical
concepts.  My use of the week as an example was intuitive, but not as accurate
as it should have been.  I should have used, 'failure to satisfy all POs that
are overdue as of Mon, 0:00 GMT, date-1' is distinct from 'failure to satisfy
all POs that are overdue as of Mon, 0:00 GMT, date-2', where date-1 is not
equal to date-2.  This involves only the particular point in time that you are
restricting me to in your post.

No it is not.  Here is where we disagree and will probably have to agree to
disagree.  Even though some of the POs overdue on Sep. 7 may be the same as
those overdue on Aug. 31, the failure to have satisfied all those that were due
on 8/31 is still a distinct metaphysical concept (or whatever you want to call
it) from the failure to have satisfied all those that were due on 9/7.

You misunderstand - I say that they are partly the same (though admittedly
partly different) because 1713 claims that the total aggregate of all POs
naming one particular Currency that are overdue are the cause of the
Infraction. Thus, my claim that an Infraction is (in this case) a
failure to act leads me to conclure that it consists in having failed
to satisfy the POs that were overdue on Sep. 7 _as well as_ those due
on Aug. 31, and that therefore D.J. governs. IOW, 1713 does not state
that continued failures are separable, but rather the contrary.

If I park for five hours in a space labeled for two hour parking, I
will receive two citations for overtime parking, one for each two
hours in excess of the legally permitted two hours.  I don't see how
this penalizes me twice for overtime parking, since each citation is
for a specific two hour period.  The root cause of both citations is

If I park for five hours in a space labeled for
two hour parking, I
will receive two citations for overtime parking,
one for each two
hours in excess of the legally permitted two
hours.  I don't see how
this penalizes me twice for overtime parking,
since each citation is
for a specific two hour period.  The root cause of
both citations is
my failure to move my car within two hours of
having parked it, but
the proximal cause of the first citation is my
failure to move my car
within two hours of having parked it, and the
proximal cause of the
second citation is my failure to move my car
within two hours of

my car.  These are

Interesting.  I come to the exact opposite conclusion from reading 1713. To me,
it specifically separates continued failures to act by week into separate
infractions.  To return to an old example from another discussion, let me
hypothesize two rules:

1.  All Players must brush every tooth in their mouths every day.
    Each day that a Players fails to do so, e incurs a penalty
    equivalent to that of a Class D Crime.

2.  At the end of each Nomic Day, if a Player has a tooth in eir mouth
    which remains unbrushed, e commits the Infraction of Poor Hygiene,
    the penalty for which is the same as a class D Crime.

Assuming that the DJ Rule has higher precedence, would you then say that either
or both of these formulations can only result in one Infraction, no matter how
many days you go without brushing one or more of your teeth?  Would it make a
difference if you failed to brush tooth 6 on Monday but then failed to brush
tooth 10 on Tuesday?

a) using Netscape for mail should be a punishable Infraction ;)
b) you're using a RL law analogy which does not apply here 'cos
c) Agora has Double Jeopardy - no such thing for parking offenses
d) parking offenses are not defined as 'failures to act'

Your assumption that you are the Clerk of the Courts is incorrect, and 
hence there is no need to resign. Although your Period of Delegation
has ended, your Term of Service ended first, activating this clause
in R1645:

      At the end of the Period of Delegation, the Delegated Player
      ceases to hold the Delegated Office, and the Delegating Player
      resumes holding the Office in the normal fashion, unless the
      Term of Service for that Office has expired. In that case, the
      Delegated Player continues to hold the Office temporarily,
      although the Office ceases to be a delegated Office.

So Andre is already holding the Office temporarily.

No need; you never ceased being CotC, although the Office is no longer
Delegated. See R1645.

I suspect I'm labouring a very small point here, but that's a weakness
of philosophers and mathematicians equally, yes? So let me say that I
don't think much of this analogy. The contrast (if there is one, which
I'm beginning to doubt) between Rules which redefine terms and Rules
which create legal fictions is not like the contrast between thinking
of light as little packets of energy and thinking of it as EM radiation.
I take it that dual wave/particle nature of light is one of the deepest
mysteries and most disturbing features of modern physics; nothing similar
can be said for the redefinition/legal fiction contrast. In the first
place, my original claim was only that some Rules do one and some Rules
do the other, not that any single Rule does both. 

I've been thinking about it some more since then, and I'm beginning
to suspect that maybe single Rules *do* do both - but that's only
because I'm beginning to suspect that 'redefinition' and 'legal
deeming' are just different names for exactly the same thing. So
again, it's not a deep mystery.

Maybe there is no absolute answer, as I originally suggested?

Now consider R789:

Rule 789/3 (Power=1)
Injunctions on Interpretations of Rules

      A CFJ alleging a Rule should be interpreted in a certain way
      must be accompanied by a list of relevant Rules, assembled by
      the Caller, which includes the Rule being interpreted.


CFJ 938 clearly is a CFJ alleging that a Rule should be interpreted in
a certain way. It is not, however, accompanied by a list of Relevant
Rules assembled by the Caller. The submission of the CFJ is therefore
in contravention of R789 and is therefore illegal. A number of
interpretative options now confront us: 

1. Since the submission of the CFJ is illegal, it is 'not really' a 
CFJ, only something that looks like a CFJ, and it can be safely ignored.

2. The CFJ is genuine (ie really is a CFJ) but should be dismissed as
improperly made. This would certainly be within the spirit of R1565
(Dismissal of a CFJ).  Unfortunately, it would not quite be within
the letter of R1565, which states:

      A Judge must dismiss a CFJ if one of the following is true of
      it:

        i) It contains no clearly-identifiable Statement.
       ii) Its Statement can not logically admit to either being TRUE
           or FALSE.
      iii) Its Statement does not relate to a matter relevant to the
           Rules.
       iv) Its Statement fails to comply with the Rules.
        v) It lacks standing, as defined elsewhere.
       vi) After a reasonable effort by the Judge to obtain all
           relevant information, no determination can be made of the
           truth or falsity of its Statement.

Clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (vi) are clearly irrelevant here. We
still have not defined what it is to lack standing as in (v), so that
cannot be of help to us either. Which brings us to (iv), which is
regrettably a little too specific. There's nothing illegal about the
Statement of CFJ 938, unless one identifies Calls for Judgement with
their Statements, and so reads R789 as requiring that certain
Statements be accompanied by lists of Relevant Rules. Is that plausible?
I'm suspicious about such an identification, but my suspicions have
been known to be without foundation. Anyone care to convince me that
this is one of them? Actually, the more I think about it, the more
tempting this options looks. So I'll pose the reverse question also:
would anyone to convince me that it wold be *wrong* to identify CFJs
with their Statements, at least for the purposes of R789?

3. The CFJ is genuine and should be judged normally. It is true that
R789 has been violated, probably but not necessarily by the Caller,
but since R789 neglects to say what follows from this, nothing does.

Reactions sought, and quickly. The clock is ticking.

Before figuring out whether double jeopardy applies, we need to figure out
whether a single failure to act can cause more than one "metaphysical"
infraction to occur.  Overdue meter offenses are a good analogy for this.

>d) parking offenses are not defined as 'failures to act'
Overdue meter violations *are* defined as 1) failing to put money in the meter
or 2) failing to move the vehicle prior to the expiration of the legal time
limit.  Both are 'failures to act' as opposed to such violations as parking at
a fire hydrant.

You are correct that what R1713 defines is not the same kind of thing
that R1503 talks about, namely, (Crimes and) Infractions arising from
acts or failures to act. But we were already committed to that once
we agreed that Swann could be cited for Persistent Indebtedness
despite being On Hold. For if PI was the result of an act or failure
to act, then Swann would have been absolved of being required perform
or refrain from performing that act by R1584. Presumably it was
considerations such as these that led Scott to characterise PI as a
'status offence'. The point of your second assertion is not as clear
to me, however. It is true that what R1713 defines does not belong
to the class of things that the Rules can, *according to R1503*,
penalize Players for - but so what? There's no reason to think that
R1503 exhausts the class of things that the Rules can penalize Players
for. If that's a premise of your argument, (and I can't tell whether 
it is or not) then your argument is in trouble.

Perhaps not, absent the whole of R1503, which goes on to do a fair
amount of work establishing the Crimes and Infractions framework. But
again, I don't see why this matters.

That seems a reasonable description of my position.

I think 'redefinition' would be much too strong a word. 'Broadening'
or 'extension' would be more accurate in my opinion. All I can say
is that I am not at present experiencing any discomfort with this
view of the situation. Are you able to be more explicit about the
sources of your discomfort? Perhaps my sanguinity is misplaced.

No, but I think this is a different use of the word 'defined'. And
I think your caution about whether 'defined as' is symmetrical is
entirely warranted, as we shall see. In R452, we have a true case of
definition: on the LHS of the definition, we have a definiens ('Vote
Collector'), and on the RHS of the definition, we have a definiendum,
ie a description which serves to pick out those things which count as
instances of the definiens. In R1503, we seem to have some kind of
degenerate definition, about which I'm not exactly sure what to say.
The first thing to note is that, if we are able at all to identify a
definiens and a defiendum in this definition, their respective
positions appear to be reversed, with the definiens ('Crime or
Infraction') appearing on the RHS and the definiendum on the LHS. But
I don't think we can assume that what we have in this case is a
simple definition of 'Crime or Infraction'. If R1503 had stated that
'a Crime or Infraction is an act or failure to act penalized by the Rules'
(ie a definition in the normal style of R452 or R206), then I think
I would have to agree with you that R1713 simply conflicted with it
if it attempted (which it does) to label something which is not a
penalized act or failure to act as an Infraction. But what R1503
actually says is that 'Such penalized actions, or failures to act,
are defined as either Crimes or Infractions.' and this seems to me
to leave open the possibility of the existence of Infractions which
are not penalized acts or failures to act.

An example may help make this clearer. I think there is a difference
between

(A) A 'chair' is defined as a horizontal flat surface supported by
    four legs;

and

(B) The class of objects consisting of a horizontal flat surface
    surface supported by four legs are defined as 'chairs'.

(A) gives necessary and sufficient conditions for being a 'chair' (ignore
the total inadequacy of the conditions offered): anything that meets the
conditions will count as a chair (sufficiency) and nothing will count as
a chair that is does not meet the conditions (necessity). (B) seems
to me to give only sufficient conditions for being a 'chair', leaving
open the possibility that other things might also be chairs, so that

(C) There is a chair which consists of a horizontal flat surface supported
    by three legs

conflicts with (A) but not with (B).

I think this is precisely the situation obtaining here, with R1503
corresponding to (B) and R1713 corresponding to (C). (A) corresponds
to my hypothetically rewritten R1503 described above.

Does that help at all?

I haven't examined the situation in depth, but on its face this
appears to me to be the correct interpretation.

What prohibits the Caller from now amending eir CFJ to include the

Interestingly, I was reading an article (by John Austin) expounding on
the nature of law.  One of his claims is that "imperfect laws" (laws
which lack sanctions) are not laws.  In Austin's conception (which is
archetypically positivist), Rule 789 would lack the status of "law"
because it lacks any concept of sanction.

It should be noted that Austin defines "law" as "a rule laid down for
the guidance of an intelligent being by an intelligent being having
power over him."  By Austin's definition, "laws of nature" (those
"rules" which determine how nonintelligent things act) are not
properly called laws.

Possibly:  The Frankenstein Monster(s) (if any) probably do not prohibit or
regulate changes to themselves.

If there *is* a Win by Pitchfork, it'll go to whomever last got a Proposed
Amendment to the Frankenstein Rule passed.  Who would that be?

3b. The CFJ is genuine and should be judged normally.  "Rule 1513" within
the Caller's Arguments is implicitly a list of relevant Rules.
