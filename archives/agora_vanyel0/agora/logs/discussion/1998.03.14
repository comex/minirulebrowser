On second thoughts, I think I may have been a bit premature in that
announcement. It's probably better that I don't take back the Promotor-
ship just yet. My wrists are still not quite in as good a state as they
might be.

As Amnesty International is fond of saying, "Silence is Consent".

But Agora doesn't have this problem. Does it? (Of course not. How
can it, when the 'government' is not only by the people, it *is*
the people.)

I just double-checked it, and - lo and behold - the typo *is*
there in my copy of the Proposal distribution after all. My
eyes or brain must be playing tricks on me...

I realized this morning before breakfast that the Delegation part of
the proto is duplicated by the revisions to R1555. So I'll certainly
be looking at streamlining that part of it. You and Michael both
seem keen to get rid of the 'normal fashion' vs 'temporarily'
distinction as it is currently constructed, and I'll consider doing
that. (Anyone else have an opinion?) The things that's actually giving
me headaches at the moment is that I want to write a new, more 
comprehensive Rule dealing with keeping the Speaker, Clerk and Justiciar
distinct, to replace the ragtag bunch of privisions we currently have
in R1450 and 910, and it's proving a pretty tough nut.

A mailer, no, but a Promotor? If he edited a quoted version of
Swann's submission, he may have removed a '>' too many.

I think that is the mosst likely explanation. I probably just used
emac's replace-string command to nuke all occurences of '>', without
thinking that there may be some in the text of the proposal.

So what is the legal standing of this? What takes effect, the text as
proposed or the text as distributed?

I have checked my mail archives, the typo in P3710 was definitely my
fault. It was not in the original proposal.

As I see it, there are two possibilities: the text as distributed
takes effect, the discrepancy notwithstanding, or nothing happens.
Rule 107 precludes applying any form of the Proposal other than that
which was distributed.

Of course, the Courts might choose to hold that Rule 107 does not
encompass scrivener's error.
