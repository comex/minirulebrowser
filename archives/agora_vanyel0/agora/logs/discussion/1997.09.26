Or maybe not. It's true (or at least, it's beginning to look as if)
the test cases of R114 and R1698 don't break the deadlock either way
as I'd hoped they would. However, this is because the debate turned
out to rest on whether we should think of those Rules as acting in a
"test all, then apply all" manner, or a "test one, then apply one"
manner, and on this the Rules, and perhaps even game custom,
commonsense, past Judgements and the best interests of the game, are
completely silent.

But, we still have cases of conflicting provisions that will pass
the (weak) tests of R114 and R1698. These are the cases Morendil
has been concentrating on. If two provisions in a single Proposal
amend the same Rule in conflicting ways, what is the result? To
get a determinate answer, we *have* to think of the provisions as
being applied in some order or other, and *that* contradicts
atomicity, whichever way you slice it, if you'll pardon the
expression.

Indeed.  What little Game Custom there is is at best tangential and

You forgot to account for the possibility of something else nullifying

R1579::disallows(gamestate gs, provision p) is

R1579::gameStateHasChanged() is

No, it doesn't.  It merely means that we consider provisions which
appear later in a Proposal to override those which appear earlier.  I
consider this to be part of determining the "maximal extent" to
which the Proposal may take effect, and a matter of resolving conflict
between conflicting provisions.

Chuck (or anyone else), do you know of an instance where a single
Proposal attempted to amend the same Rule twice?

I assume by 'override' you mean that one of the conflicting
provisions actually does not take effect. If they did both take
effect, then what you suggest would just be ordering by another name.
But now R594 works against you. I'd say it's pretty clear that an
application of the provisions of the Proposal which applies *both*
provisions in some order or other (even if one of them turns out to
be a null-amendment) must be an implementation which is greater in
extent than one which applies only one of the provisions and
overrides the other, and is therefore *required* by R594. Ie, in the
case of conflicting provisions, the non-atomic reading is required by
R594.

>Chuck (or anyone else), do you know of an instance where a single
>Proposal attempted to amend the same Rule twice?

Well, it would be nice if we had a precedent to consider. But if one
doesn't turn up, of what relevance is that? You don't deny it's
possible. I recall it nearly happened with your Proposal reform. You
made so many different drafts amending so many Rules, I think I
recall that in one draft, different amendments were suggested for the
same Rule.  It's not hard to imagine it happening.

In general, I don't understand why you are so resistant to the
treatment I suggest for Proposals containing multiple provisions.
It's a precise extension by analogy with our treatment of multiple
Proposals adopted simultaneously. Surely it's sensible to treat
these cases similarly! The only difference between them is that
conflicting Proposals are much more likely than conflicting
provisions within one Proposal, but why is that a relevant
difference?  Both situations are possible, and raise exactly the same
issues when they occur. Given the silence of the Rules on the
subject, I'd say that R376 provides a damn good precedent as to how
this case should be handled.

I'd *love* to be selected (assuming Calabresi is to be replaced due
to ineligibility). It's an important Judgement - probably the most
important Judgement in a long time - and it's been (and it continues
to be) a fascinating debate, with many twists and turns. I'd love a
good excuse to summarize everything that's happened so far.

Well, what about R376? True, it doesn't actually speak to the
situation under discussion. But it *does* tell us how to handle a
strongly analogous situation, namely, the case of multiple Proposals
adopted simultaneously. In the absence of other considerations,
that's a pretty powerful argument for handling the current case in
the analogous fashion.

I think our talk session died before I saw that transmission. We
must have noticed it independently. I'll propose amendments to
both Rules. I prefer the counterfactual resolution of the tension,
since it makes it clearer that the provisions are not applied at
all, rather than applied and then cancelled.  Anyone disagree?

Actually, I think Calabresi is already ineligible, due to not having

That's as may be. But if you want the kind of atomicity you are
defending to give you a reason to overturn the Judgement of CFJ 933,
then you have to say that the provisions are all *applied* simultaneously, 
not merely that they are all *adopted* simultaneously. For if they
are merely adopted simultaneously but applied in order, then Morendil
can use whatever concept of 'before' is implicit in your use of the
ordering, and argue that VTs ceased to have a Mintor before they
acquired a new one, in that sense of 'before'.

This is the 'constructible moment in time' argument again. The argument
goes that R1579 could not have had a chance to take after VTs ceased to
have a Mintor but before they acquired a new one because there was no
moment in time at which VTs did not have a Mintor.

But the argument is flawed. There is no basis for the assumption that
R1579 can only take effect if there is constructible moment in time
at which VTs ceased to have a Mintor. All that is required for R1579
to take effect is that VTs cease to have a Mintor before they acquire
a new one, in *whatever* sense of 'before' is being used to define
the order in which the provisions of P3533 take effect. Hence the
only way to argue that R1579 did not take effect is to argue that the
provisions of P3533 did *not* take effect in any order at all, but
rather all at once.  This is the current topic of debate between
myself, Morendil and Zefram on one side, and Scott, Michael and
perhaps Chuck on the other.

At first I had hoped that an examination of the operations of R114
and R1698 would show that we cannot think of the provisions in a
Proposal as taking effect all at once, because I thought that these
Rules must test each provision as it attempts to take effect, in
order. But closer examination revealed that this reading, while
possible, is not forced. We could choose to interpret R114 and R1698
as testing all the provisions in order, and then allowing all those
which pass to take effect at once. No knockdown argument for or against
either side seems likely to be available.

However, when it comes to the possibility of conflicting provisions
in a single Proposal, I feel I am on surer ground. Here, I think,
two different kinds of considerations strongly indicate that we should
think of the multiple provisions in a single Proposal as taking effect
in an order, rather than all at once. Firstly, if we don't impose an
ordering on the provisions, the results of conflicting provisions is
indeterminate. That's bad. Secondly, we have the pronouncements of 
R376 in a strongly analogous case, namely that where multiple Proposals
take effect at the same time. In such cases, R376 tells us that the 
Proposals take effect in a certain order. It's a basic principle of
law to treat like cases alike, and these are like cases. So I conclude
that multiple provisions in a single Proposal take effect in a
certain order. The order they appear in in the Proposal seems the most
natural choice of order.

The rest of your post shows that have understood me perfectly.
In fact, we agree on a great deal!

Or, putting the shoe on the other foot, you need to argue that they
aren't. But I agree with you that this is the central question.
I have two reasons for thinking that that other Rules can get a
look in while a Proposal is taking effect. Firstly, isn't this
part of what 'severability' amounts to? I mean: isn't severability
a kind of independence, meaning that provisions are *not* to be
considered to be bound together in the way that you require? Secondly,
look at how we handle the analogous case of multiple Proposals
adopted at the same time. We readily admit that other Rules can get
a look in between Proposals, so why not between provisions?

I agree completely, particularly with your observation that
temporal vs logical orders are irrelevant; any ordering will do.
I particularly like the terminology of functions and I find that
putting the discussion in terms of composition of functions makes
the issues particularly clear and vivid, at least to me. And I
agree that simultaneity is a mirage; we are more or less forced
to think of the functions as being applied in a certain order.

My answer to your burning question, already sketched above, is: given
the way we handle the analogous case of Proposals, why shouldn't we
think that the results of intermediate computations, as you put it,
is accessible to other Rules? And doesn't severability in fact imply
that the results of intermediate computations are available?

Another thing just occurred to me. General Chaos quite rightly
declined to overturn my Judgement in CFJ 937, despite Morendil's
arguments to the contrary. When pressed on the matter, the good
General replied that he saw no reason to overturn my Judgement, even
if other Judgements were possible. In other words, he saw his role as
Justice, much as I have done in the past, as that of overturning
Judgements only when it could be demonstrated that the initial Judge
had made some kind of mistake, and not merely because the Justice
happens to disagree with the Judge over some matter of taste. Now,
General Chaos and those who argue with him may not like Morendil's
Judgement (alright, all you pedants out there, Elde's Judgement), but
I think even they might agree that they have not shown that he made a
mistake in making it. By his own lights, then, General Chaos should
be arguing that the Judgement of CFJ 933 be allowed to stand. 

I ask that the Justices keep this is mind when considering their
Judgements.

Although I'm not the Archivist, I will react on this:

The CFJ you are refering to is probably CFJ 815, called by Swann, judged
by favor.

Argument:

There has been made an argument that since the Rules Governing Groups
have been amended substantially, that any Groups formed under the old
Rules cease to exist-- or at least cease to have any effect vis-a-vis
the Game of Agora.  It is my contention that there is nothing to support
this view, and in fact, the oft-referenced 1011 actually forbids such an
interpretation.

Before the adoption of 1760, there was a class of Entities known as Groups
the contention is that, since 1760 made wholesale changes to the Entitie
known as Groups, that the incompatibly-formed prior Groups ceased to exist.

This is in direct contradiction with 1011!

>From 1011:

     Any Entity which is created by the Nomic Rules, and which exists
      only within the context of Agora Nomic (such as Points, Votes,
      Currencies and any Official Records) may *not* be changed by any
      action other than those specified by the Rules.

What Rule specifies the destruction of the old Groups?  None.  Certainly
the amendments in 1760 say nothing about repealing the legal authority of
prior Groups.  Any such diminishment of prior Groups is an arbitrary change,
wholly outside the authority of the Ruleset, and therefore void.

And, since Groups themselves are still a defined Entity in the Ruleset, and
there was no period of time where Groups were not defined, any alleged
discontinuity is addressed by 1011.  The Rules changed the way Groups
were defined, therefore the Entities known as Groups changed their properties,
because that is the only option specified by the Rules.

======================================================================

Arguments Judge:

I approach this CFJ with some trepidation, as it touches on
deep and largely unvisited areas of Agora metaphysics and
ontology.  The fact that it is a CFJ on the interpretation
of a specific Rule, though, limits its scope enough that I
have some hope of dealing adequately with the questions raised,
in this limited context.

The issues underlying the truth or falsehood of the Statement
concern the nature of the relationship between the Rules
of Agora and the rest of the Game state; in particular,
between the Rules that define and govern Game Entities and
instances of the Entities themselves, especially as the
Rules change over time.  The fact that the Rules do in
fact change over time complicates the relationship
enormously.

So what does in fact happen to an existing Game Entity when
the Rules that govern its properties (its nature, its
description, its relationship to the rest of the Game)
change?  The Statement requires us, in particular, to
consider whether or not the Entity changes to conform to
the amendment; that is, whether or not the Entity changes
in such a way that the new version of the Rules correctly
describes it.  There seem to be three possiblities here,
for any particular Entity and any particular Rule change:

 a) The Entity might remain unchanged, despite the change
    to the Rules.  This seems unlikely, though, as the
    Entity would then be in violation of the Rules; for
    a Platonist, this is flatly impossible, whereas for
    a Pragmatist it is at least a mistake.  While there is
    no Rule that explictly says that all Entities must
    conform to the Rules, such a Rule seems unnecessary:
    it is essential to the Rules being Rules that the
    Entities they create must at all times conform to them.
    So this possibility is not to be taken seriously.

 b) The Entity might change, so as to be in conformance
    with the new state of the Rules.  This seems relatively
    unproblematic.  For some Entities and some Rule changes,
    of course, the only change to the Entity that would
    bring it (or the Game state as a whole) into conformance
    with the Rules would be for it to cease to exist.  If,
    for instance, the Rules governing a particular Entity
    were to be amended so as to be completely different,
    and describe some other Entities with no properties in
    common with the Entities they previously defined (or
    to define no Entities at all), it would be foolish to
    place great weight on the simple fact of an unchanging
    Rule number.  Similarly, if all the Rules that provide
    for an Entity to exist at all are repealed without
    simultaneous replacement, the only permissible change
    would seem to be destruction. But in general, there will be
    some lesser change to the existing Entities that will bring
    them into conformance with the Rules while still
    allowing them to exist.

    Ideal Rule Changes will of course specify exactly
    what changes should occur to existing Entities to bring
    them into conformance with the new Rules for that
    type of Entity.  But where the Rules are silent on
    the issue, for whatever reason, the issue must be
    settled in some other way; by, for instance, the
    Courts (per Rule 217 and family), or simply the
    rational consensus of the Players.

 c) The Entity might simply cease to exist, or cease to
    be an Entity of the type that it formerly was, by
    virtue of the change to its governing Rules, despite
    the fact that a less-drastic change could have brought
    it into conformance with the new Rules.  There seems
    to be little reason to adopt this strategy, however,
    and a Judge called upon to decide on the fate of some
    pre-existing Entities in a case where the new Rules
    are silent on the issue of conformance-chanes would be
    well-advised to consider it only as a last resort, as
    suggested in the previous paragraph.

What light is thrown on the above musings by Game Custom and previous
Judgements?  Surprisingly little.  The Potato CFJ, for instance,
which at first seems relevant at least to the issue that led to
this CFJ, is in fact not relevant to the present Statement, since
that case did not involve a change to Rules that governed the
properties of a pre-existing Game Entity.  It was, in particular,
the finding of the Judge that there was no pre-existing Game
Entity of the type governed by the new Rule.  That case also
involved a newly-created Rule, not an amendment as the current
Statement specifies.  The Judgement held that a previously-
existing Entity which had been given a particular name by a
Player acting within the Rules did not simply by virtue of
this name take on the properties of a similarly-named Entity
later created by a new Rule; this raises issues in the same
general area as the current question, but not close enough to
shed any light on the current Statement itself.

Game Custom clearly teaches that at least *some* of the properties
of an Entity are implicitly changed when the Rules governing those
properties are changed.  There are countless examples; Rules on
Kudos, Points, Marks, Contests, and so on have all been changed,
without any suggestion that the pre-existing Entities of that
class should therefore cease to exist.  At first glance, this
might seem to give us our answer without further effort, but
while I think it is extremely suggestive and helpful, it is not
entirely final.  I have been unable to find a very strong example
of a deep and fundamental change to the nature of a pre-existing
Entity being caused by a change to the governing Rule in the
absence of a "grandfather" clause.  Such a finding would have
been conclusive that (b) above is the correct consequence of
even such deep changes.  On the other hand, I found no cases
on the other side, either, of Entities ceasing to exist when
they could have been changed instead.  So on balance (b)
still seems the heavy favorite.

Having determined, so far, that (b) seems correct, and that
the Rules and Game Custom (not to speak of common sense)
favor the truth of the dependant clause in the Statement,
what shall we make of the Statement as a whole?  Does the
truth of the dependant clause in fact rest on interpretation
of Rule 1011?

The Argument presented by the Caller deals mainly with the
application of the Statement to a particular issue that
is currently before the Agoran Public.  Since the statement
itself does not mention that issue, however, no Judgement
on the issue itself is required.  The Argument does,
however, illustrate how Rule 1011 comes into consideration.
It would be possible to interpret 1011 so as to prohibit
(b) above (that interpretation would also, as far as I
can tell, prohibit (c), and we'd be in a fine mess).  If
the correct interpretation of 1011 does prohibit (b),
then, the Statement should be judged FALSE.  Otherwise,
it is TRUE.

Under what circumstances would 1011 prohibit the changes
to Game Entities suggested in (b)?  1011 prohibits any
changes to certain types of Entity, if those changes are
caused "by any action other than those specified by the
Rules".  Could the changes suggested in (b) be a change
of the type thus prohibited?  The changes in (b) are
caused by a change to the Rules.  That isn't an action,
though, so since causation is transitive we continue to
follow the chain.  Changes to the Rules are caused by
various actions, and (by Rule 116) the only actions
which can cause changes to the Rules are actions that are
permitted by (which will do as a synonym for "specified
by" in this context) the Rules.  So: the actions which
cause the changes suggested in (b) are actions specified
by the Rules; therefore, Rule 1011 does not prohibit those
changes.  This, along with the considerations of Game
Custom and so on outlined above, lead us to conclude that
the Statement in this CFJ is TRUE.

Respectfully Submitted,

>From R911:

      A Player is ineligible for selection if any of the following is
      true:

       iv) E was ineligible to Judge the CFJ that resulted in the
           matter under consideration, and this restriction does not
           prevent three eligible Players from being selected by the
           CotC for the Board.

You concede that Calabresi was, once upon a time, ineligible to Judge
the CFJ. His later eligibility, even if we concede it, in no way changes
this fact, and he therefore meets the criterion on ineligibility to
serve as Justice.

If this argument persuades you, please retract your denial and make
a new selection. Otherwise, please indicate that you do not intend to
retract, and I'll make a CFJ. (Whew, this could drag on for quite a
while yet!)

And you think your case is easier than mine? In your example, I think
you could argue that the first provision is ineffective, but that
this does not violate R594, because applying that provision would
be not be permitted by the Rules.

No, but I believe it's better in general to provide a high level

This is just not true. 

If a proposal's provision says
  "The X factor shall become equal to 2 X + 1."

There is an ordering of "events" there; first X is multiplied by 2,
and then one is added to it.  And yet, I'm sure you're happy that this
can be said to happen instantaneously. 

This has nothing to do with computer science per se; it's all about
the composition of functions, a mathematical concept. 

I also contend that the previous provision might as well be replaced
by two provisions: 

  "The X factor shall double its value."
 
  "The X factor shall be incremented."

Unless provisions commute, and they don't usually, there *must* always
be an order in their application.  Yet, this ordering does not
preclude everything happening in an instant.

Michael.

Yes it does, but I raised the example more to illustrate game custom
than the interpretation of R594. But in any case, I've now conceded
that P2628 can't show us anything either way about whether the
provisions in a Proposal are adopted all at once or in some order.

With that at least I completely agree. I contend that the first issue is
one on which both the Rules and game custom are mostly silent, though
it is counter to our intuitive notion that the Rules are *never*, as
you term it, 'held in abeyance' (an intuition that 101 certainly lends
a lot of support to), but that the second can be resolved by an appeal
to game custom alone. (Even though it is, at times, conflicting custom -
for instance I found Proposal 2470, which seems to go counter to the
mainstream of relying on Proposal provisions to be ordered.)

What if this 'screening' process involves a Rule which, as part of its
determination of a provision's validity, makes changes to the game
state ?

But the screening or atomicity concept is mostly concerned with the

maybe cannot enact all of them because they somehow contradict each
other, the "test all, then apply all" manner, or a "test one, then
apply one" manner still are different possible choices to check for
the triggering of other rules, not changed or otherwise influenced by
the proposal.

I want to pick on Scott's first statement in the 'atomic' theory of
Proposals :

>In my opinion, while a Proposal is being implemented, all mechanistic
>functions of the Rules are held in abeyance until the Proposal is
>fully implemented.

I've been making a point a few times in passing that I want to restate
in terms of the above; Scott seems to be making a distinction between
one kind of effect of the Rules - the 'mechanistic', which presumably
includes anything that effects a "change to the game state" - and
some other, unnamed as yet, but which I'll call 'legalistic' - which
I suppose comprises all determinations as to whether any given "change
to the game state" is legal, or as to the Nomic properties attached
to any entities relevant to the Rules, as well as all definitions of
our various legal fictions.

It is apparent that the 'atomicity' of Proposals - i.e. the notion
that "mechanistic functions of the Rules are held in abeyance until
the Proposal is fully implemented" fully relies on this distinction.

I believe this distinction is at present artificial - that is, I believe
that Rules may have both mechanistic and legalistic aspects, and that it
will not be easy to distinguish one from the other, and that it would
even be possible, though that may not be the case in the Ruleset at
present, to construct Rules in which both aspects would be inseparably
entangled.

I would not be adverse to legislating in favor of atomicity, but *only*
if we first take steps to make this distinction explicit in the Rules,
and to do so in a fundamental and unassailable way (at Pow=2 at least).

Why is that?
<<

Because since the PC reform lots of payment orders have been executed
in a perfectly legal way, mostly for VTs (salaries etc - most with the
chancellor as payor, I guess) and for indulgences (blots have been
flying all over the place). People also tried to satisfy them, but if
it turns out now that the VTs, indulgences etc we thought we were
transferring all the time didn't even exist, all these payment orders
are still unsatisfied, and have been so for weeks.

So everyone who is payor of such POs has been incurring PI penalties
for weeks. Note also that the wording of 1733 can not be used to
declare all these POs as disputed: yes, the currency destruction
crisis has been the subject of several CFJs - but 1733 only accepts
COEs regarding the POs (no errors involved in the POs, though), or
CFJs "challenging the legality of the execution" of the POs - but we
don't have such CFJs either.

R594 was merely the extension to arbitrary provisions of existing
legislation and game custom concerning Rule Changes; I think an
argument based on what 2628 assumed as to ordering or atomicity
of Proposal provisions is valid in showing Game Custom to support
such assumptions in the current Rules. (As would, I think, any
example of a Proposal which passed since the Ruleset became Agoran
in the sense of the 'Concept of a Rule Change in the Initial Set'
debate.)

There are two questions here.

1. Given the way we handle the analogous case of Proposals, why
   shouldn't we think that the results of intermediate computations,
   as you put it, is accessible to other Rules?

I argue that we should conceal those intermediate results because of
the language of R594; it says that a proposal's provisions are
implemented.  To my mind this says to me that the composition of the
functions is calculated, and that we apply the resulting function.
There are no intermediate states ever present, except as a calculating
convenience for our own benefit (q.v. my X = 2X + 1 vs X = 2X, X = X +
1 example).

Note, the functions that we compose are a little complicated because
they have to check whether or not they are allowed to apply.
Furthermore, this check must be done against the state they are
applied to, not the initial state, as Scott seems to be implying in
some recent posts. 

In other words the provision calculation function (pcf) will be of the
form:
  pcf (proposal_provision, state) = 
      /
      |  proposal_provision(state)    if provision allowed by state
     / 
    <    state                        if provision not allowed but
     \                                   severable
     |   
     \   abort everything             if provision not allowed and
      \                                  severable

pcf is a function from (states * provisions) --> states.

The reason we have to seek permission from the intermediate state
value is that previous provisions may alter the rules to allow
subsequent provisions.  This is not a problem with the atomicity
argument, it simply makes the calculation function a little more
complicated.  I still argue that what happens as a result of 594 is
intrinsically nothing any different from arithmetic. 

The second question is:
2.  And doesn't severability in fact imply that the results of
    intermediate computations are available?

The intermediate computations are available to the process of
computation, as given in the function definition above, but this
doesn't have much to do with severability per se; they are there as
much in a provision to multiply by two and then add one. 

Michael.

PS: before anyone suggests that this admission of ordering in the
application of functions opens the door to 'before' for the purposes
of "logical ordering" or some such, I would just ask whether or not
such people believe that a rule which forbidded my favourite X factor
from ever being even should be able to fire when a proposal that
calculated 2 X + 1 was adopted.

This is clearly not the case.  Everytime Judges consider CFJs, they
make a simple determination of fact that doesn't run the risk of
setting off all sorts of side effects (though of course there are
effects in the publication of the CFJ decision &c).  The process of
determining which provisions are legal in a proposal is exactly
analogous.

(Remember, to continue the program analogy, we *could* be passing
states by value.)

The appeal that is to be considered soon will hopefully look at all of
these issues.  

Michael.

When drafting R114, I was well aware of this inconsistency, and would
initially have preferred to leave out "is cancelled and".  (I was copying
the wording from elsewhere in the Ruleset.)  But I noticed a possible
problem with the application of R114 in such a form: it states that
a game state change "does not take place", but doesn't say what else
happens to it.  There would be the potential for a Judgement to say
that the game state change still existed in some form, perhaps waiting
until 114 no longer prevents it from happening.  The "is cancelled"
part thus makes it clear that the game state change will never occur,
and does not necessarily imply that it does occur.

If there are two events there, then I cannot be happy to say that.
Since in my view events are totally ordered, no two events happen
simultaneously. On the other hand, I am not committed to the view
that there really are two events here. I'm perfectly prepared to
view this as the single event described by 'the X factor's coming
to have a new value of 2X+1'.

Similarly, I am not committed to the view that the X factor's tripling
its value is really 3 events each corresponding to an addition of X, nor
am I committed to the view that each of these additions is really a
number of different events, each of which corresponds to the application
of the successor function to some argument. Events can be individuated
on many levels of fine-grainedness, and I'm not committed to saying that
the most fine-grained level is always or even usually the appropriate one.

Rephrasing it this way is not equivalent. Putting it into two separate
sentences almost forces the reading on which there are two events, not
one. Let's give the X factor an initial value for the purposes of
discussion, say, 5. Now imagine another Rule has as the condition of
its applicability that the X factor has a value of 10. Does this Rule
apply or not? In the second case, I would almost certainly say that
it does.  In the first case, I would tend to doubt it.

OK. Here's a summary of the situation as I see it, in the terminology
you have helpfully introduced.

Provisions are viewed as (associative) functions taking game states
to game states.  Call the state at some time s. Consider a Proposal
with three provisions; call them the functions f, g and h; let us also
have a Rule R whose condition of applicability is that the game state
has the value g.f(s).

Question: should we think of the game state as successively taking
the values s, f(s), g.f(s), h.g.f(s)? Or should we rather
think of the game state as moving directly from s to h.g.f(s)?
If the game state ever has the value g.f(s), then R will be
applied, so answering this question is important. I take it that
this question is the the same question as: are there really 3 events
here, or 1? If 1, then the Proposal is atomic in your sense. Have
I understood you correctly so far?

Assuming that I have, how do we answer this question? As my opening
remarks about multiplication, addition and successorship were meant
to imply, there can be different answers to the question: how many
events (or mathematical operations) are there? The different answers
depend on how fine-grained a level of analysis you pick. So I see
the task as being this: choose an appropriate level of analysis, and
defend the appropriateness of that level.

I meet that task as follows: I choose to individuate events at the
level of provisions. Higher levels are possible, and so are lower
levels. Evidently, you choose individuation at the higher level of
Proposals. Conceivably, someone might want to choose a lower level,
so that a single provision which tripled the value of some variable
would be seen by that person as 3 additions, or even as a whole bunch
of successorships. Nevertheless, individuation of events at approximately
the level of provisions is, I claim, the most appropriate. (I say
'approximately' because I want to leave room for the possibility that
we might want to count provisions like "Every Player receives 10 points."
as resulting in many events. Still, if absolute precision were
required - and I don't see why it should be - I would probably be
prepared to stick to my guns and claim that this is just one event,
if that's what falls out of the analysis here defended.)

Why do I make this claim? Because it seems to correspond to the
intuitive way we think these things, as reflected in our having
adopted various Rules which speak in terms of provisions (especially
the severability of provisions!), like R594, or R1339 (a rule change
is just a kind of provision). Do you have reasons for thinking that
I'm wildly wrong to pick this level of individuation as the
(approximately) correct one? If this level seems as natural to you as
it does to me, then you cannot resist the conclusion that the game
state does occupy distinct states corresponding to the application of
each provision in turn, so that in the example above there are 3
events, not 1, and that atomicity is therefore false.

As I've just stated in another message, the "cancelled" wording is not in
conflict with the rest of the Rule, or even meaningless.  You're assuming
that "cancelled" == "reversed", which is not necessarily an appropriate
interpretation.

Fallacy: there is no implied ordering there at all, because there is only
one event.  X is never doubled, nor is it incremented; the provision
clearly states that X is changed, once, to a value that it specifies.
The fact that it specifies that value as a function of the previous
value is irrelevant.

This is clearly two provisions, requiring two events, and in the absence
of specification to the contrary these provisions are separable, and,
I believe, ordered.

I do not intend to retract. You have a good point, I agree, but I'd rather
have this straightened out in the courts anyway...

Judges are Players, and Rules are Rules - "exactly" analogous is IMHO
a gratuitous use of the word 'exactly'. ;) In particular, Judges are
(your claim above notwithstanding) allowed to implement a very
restricted set of side-effects, in the form of Injunctions; whereas
Rules can implement whatever side-effects they like as part of the
process of determining whether a provision is legal or not; just *what*
could prevent them from doing that ?

Didn't I provide an example of such a Rule ? If I didn't, here it is :

Rule:
* When the identity of a Mintor changes, all units of the
  appropriate Currency shall be destroyed, and the change
  shall only be legal insofar as that has taken place.

Proposal:
* Install Michael in the Office of the Chancellor.  

Atomicity implies that the Rule above cannot be effective; there being
no good reason why an arbitrary Rule should not be effective in the
absence of Rules conflicting with it, we should rule out atomicity,
or make Rules such as the above illegal.

> (Remember, to continue the program analogy, we *could* be passing
> states by value.)

Exactly what I'm saying in the above is that we *could* be, but we
don't *have* to. Precisely, I submit that I could write a Rule such
that it requires 'pass-by-reference' to be effective in determining
if a provision is legal or not.

Yes, this debate does tend to devolve into the Platonic/Pragmatic
debate.  What is interesting, however, is that the proponents of each
side seem to be cutting across the traditional lines of the
Platonic/Pragmatic debate....

Bullshit.  Rule 594 was a Giant Leap Away from Game Custom in a great
many respect.  The Proposal Reform was a radical reform, and I believe
that any claim of Game Custom that predates that reform must be
scrutinized very carefully.

What's silly is that a few days ago, I had a long e-mail written comparing
imfinitesimals to Planck time, but I decided (and I believe rightfully so)
that it wasn't going to be as constructive as I thought :)

I won't ask for an example, because you will, no doubt, concoct some
ludicrous example of a Rule that no sane Player would even dream of
proposing, let alone voting for.

I really don't care about deliberately insane applications.  I am more
concerned with how the law affects routine activities.  I will not
countenance adopting law that makes routine activity exceedingly
difficult or contorted merely because it has some marginal benefit
with respect to insane activity.

Thanks!  I've been thinking, and thinking, and trying to come up with the
perfect example to describe the idea of "ordered & simultaneous" and that's
it!

And Steve had it right when he said that they are all *applied*
simultaneously after all effects have been added up.

What about self-conflicting proposals?  Well, first, why would anyone make
a proposal that conflicts with itself, unless it was accidental?  But if
they did, I would argue that the result would be the effect of applying
them in order.  I don't see how allowing the rules to interrupt a proposal
is constructive in any way.  It simply adds a *lot* of work to anyone who
wishes to make a complicated proposal to make sure that the rules don't
interrupt and destroy everything or cause problems.  I think that's a
complication of proposing that quite simply doesn't need to be there.

I don't really care that much about CFJ 933; please stop acting as

far more interested in establishing a coherent, consistent, and
rational model for the application of Proposals than I am in

I will quite honestly say that I don't think Rule 594's language in
this matter is the least bit helpful in this case.  It's
underspecified whether the provisions are implemented all at once, or
independently.

But there *are* two events there.  X is doubled, then is incremented.
There is a distinct ordering there.

What if I made the following proposal:

----
Create rules with the titles "Fake Rule I", "Fake Rule II", "Fake Rule III"
where:

"Fake Rule I" has the text:

This is Fake Rule I.

"Fake Rule II" has the text:

This is Fake Rule II.

"Fake Rule III" has the text:

This is Fake Rule III.
---

That is written such that all three happen simultaneously, is it not?  If
so, does that differ from:

---
Create a rule with the title "Fake Rule I" which has the text:

This is Fake Rule I.

Create a rule with the title "Fake Rule II" which has the text:

This is Fake Rule II.

Create a rule with the title "Fake Rule III" which has the text:

This is Fake Rule III.
---

In my opinion, a proposal is a series of instructions which are to be
applied simultaneously.  I don't see anything wrong with that opinion.  I'm
not contradicting myself.

The proposal makes three changes to the game state.  The application of
those three changes to the game state in order creates a new game state.
At the moment the proposal passes, the game state becomes that new game
state with no intermediates.  To apply a proposal provision by provision
makes it more complicated to propose rules.

Someone mentioned a while back that when judging CFJ 933, Rule 217 would
apply.  I agree.  To judge that proposals are applied provision by
provision is not in the best interests of the game as it makes it more
complicated a task to propose new rules.

Won't the outcome of CFJ 933 establish a precedent for that, though?

Ok, that's correct of course. But: now these infractions will be
reported late, will there be separate infractions reported (and blots
handed out) for every week in which POs were lying around unsatisfied,
or just one infraction for being indebted for several weeks? I think
that 1713 requires the former. Of course, some people received blots
for debts that were visible all the time, and for such weeks they will
not receive more indebtedness bolts for the same currency; also the
late reprting of the infractions will mean that the penalty blots (as
POs) will only lead to more indebtedness in the future.

Of course, 1713 only authorizes recordkeepors to report indebtedness
infractions, it doesn't force em to. So we could all agre to sweep
these infractions under the rug. But on the other hand, I think it
auhorizes every recordkeepor (including ones for player minted
currencies) to report indebtedness in any currency and issue the
corresponding POs, so every player would have to cooperate. I'd rather
see a formal amnesty for such infractions properly proposed, instead
of quietly ignoring these infractions.

No, but there are other problems with applying that opinion.

Not really.  There are very few cases where sequential application
causes any inconvenience, and nothing yet rules out the possibility
of a Proposal want simultaneous application from specifying so.  OTOH,
having simultaneous application the default makes a number of reasonable
Proposals self-contradictory, and of undefined effect.

Rule 698 implicitly makes all non-Players ineligible.

Very well, then:  "The CotC selects a Judge from those Players eligible

On the other hand, it seems that the average person would expect the
result of "The X factor is replaced by 2*X+1" and "The X factor is
doubled, and then incremented by one" to yield the exact same result.
This is why I assert that the indivisible application of provisions is
more in keeping with common sense.

I will not comment on Michael's mathematical exposition of state
change functions; it relies, as do Morendil's programming-based
expositions, on knowledge gained through experience with a particular
discipline, and therefore falls within the domain of "other
standards."

Actually, by your above parenthesized comments, a provision might
entail several Rule Changes: "Rules 2345, 3456, and 4567 are
repealed."

Again, the issue is not whether provisions are applied in some
sequence, but whether the intermediate states that arise as they are
applied are exposed.  I am of the belief that these intermediate steps
are too fleeting to have impact.  Their existence is too transient to
have legal significance, in my opinion.  I feel that Rules like Rule
1579 should be interpreted to apply to conditions which persist for
some tangible period of time, and not to those which hold only for a
fleeting instant.

Not a Proposal

Provision 1:  The Glork is Red if and only if Provision 2 of this Proposal
              is implemented.
Provision 2:  The Glork is Blue if and only if Provision 1 of this Proposal
              is not implemented.

If such a Proposal were adopted, what would happen?

Rule 3000:
If a Proposal attempts to destroy a Currency's Mintor without stating
explicitly that the attempt is intentional, then the attempt is ineffective;
furthermore, the Chancellor shall pay out 1 VT from that Player to the Bank.

Rule 3001:
Each Player's VT Surplus is the number of VTs e possesses, minus the number
of VTs owed by em in outstanding POs.  Having a VT Surplus at least twice
that of any other Player is a Win Condition.

Mark has 5 VTs, Luke has 3 VTs, everyone else has 1 VT each, and there are
no outstanding VT POs.

Proposal 3002:
Repeal Rule 2500 ("Define the Mintor of Indulgences").
Create a Rule with the text "The Mintor of Indulgences is the Bank".
Repeal Rule 3000.
Repeal Rule 3001.

That reminds me - what exactly is the particular discipline that *does*
bear on issues in Agora, may we know ? I doubt very much that there is
any, and insofar as no one among us makes a living playing Agora, one
could claim that any Player's arguments are suspect on the same grounds,
or so it seems to me. All of us do interpret the Rules in the light of
whatever our day-to-day intellectual activities are.

That's three provisions, then. Or does 'a provision' have to be the same
as 'a sentence' ? I don't think so - nor would I hazard giving a precise
definition of 'a provision', no more than I wanted to give Chuck a
precise answer to the question of what a 'change to the game state' is.
Our intuitive notion of what a provision is should be enough.

It shouldn't be too difficult to legislate that.

It's precisely the difficulty that one has in trying to pick the
function apart that leads me to conclude that you should not.  It's a
function which is the composition of sub-functions, but yes, you do go
immediately from s to h.g.f(s)

Why do you need to introduce the concept of event at all?  All that
R594 says is that a new state should be computed.  If we find it
easier to compute intermediate states as a calculational convenience,
that's up to us, but these intermediates have no legal significance,
and never exist.

I have the advantage of Occam's Razor here: I propose one event; you
propose three. :-)

Provisions are a convenient syntactic category.  That's is why they
appear in the rules, because the rules naturally concern themselves
with syntax as well as semantics.  The way in which severability works
forces us to look at provisions because it is at the provision level
that we are invited (not required) to allow sub-functions to fail and
thereby turn themselves into the identity function.

However, syntax does not equate to semantics.  And I do strongly
believe that a rule which says that "X <- 2 X; X <- X + 1" should be
semantically equivalent in all respects to X <- 2X + 1, in the same
way as where
    f(x) = 2 * x
    g(x) = x + 1
    h(x) = 2 * x + 1

    f . g = h

In this case, that is not the issue.  One of your sentences above

Assume on the outset that all provisions are implemented, as no rules
forbid us from doing so.  Nor do the provisions forbid each other from
having due effect. 

To implement #1, we set the Glork to Red.
To implement #2, we do nothing, as the current state (a Red Glork and
   #1 implemented satisfies #2's specification).

You lose. :-)

But seriously, you can no doubt construct proposals whose provisions
cause proper tangles and paradoxes.  I mentioned this in an aside to
an earlier post when I asked about the possibility of a loop in a
proposal.

But 594 comes to the rescue.  It says:
  "Provisions which are unclear, ambiguous, or inapplicable are
   ignored."

Assuming you managed to come up with a sequence of provisions which
did create a paradox, they just wouldn't apply because of the above
clause in 594.

Michael.

My original wording is only slightly more verbose: 

      The Clerk of the Courts selects a Judge from those Players
      eligible to Judge by randomly choosing from all those eligible
      subject to the provision that a Player's chance of selection is
      directly proportional to their Acuity.

I'll consider it.

This is an interesting example, but it certainly doesn't seem to pose
any real problems for either view on how the rules work.

R2500 obviously can't be repealed, so that fails.  The Chancellor is
obliged to issue a payment order to take a VT off 3002's proposer
(presumably Luke).  Severability ensures that the rest of the proposal
goes ahead.  The rule defining the Bank's Mintor goes through.  And
then 3000 and 3001 get repealed.

The Chancellor will issue his PO, but poor old Mark won't win because
the rules giving him the win have long since gone, and Luke might
delay making the payment in any case.  

Perhaps if you'd been a little more careful with the example you could
have demonstrated a difference between the two interpretations.  But
of course, we already have one such; the putative destruction of VTs.

Michael.

To argue for independent application is a route to madness.  I think
the real issue is whether or not intermediate results of provisions
are visible.  I don't think they should be, precisely because they are
an entirely unnecessary construct, invented by people with too much
time on their hands, and with no support from the rules :-)

This is the best example yet.  However, given my view that the
application of a proposal's provisions is instantaneous, I see no
problem with your rule.  It will fire after the change has taken
place, and the currency will be destroyed, precisely because the
identity of the Mintor has changed.  

A more contentious example would be a proposal that changed the
Chancellor to me, and then back to Scott again.  

I would claim that this would have no effect.  You would claim
otherwise, obviously.

That's why we have a court considering this question at the moment.

Well, if you messed with the proposal adoption rules (not hard, just
take precendence over 594 with its paltry power of 1), this wouldn't
be hard.  As it stands at the moment, I don't believe it.

Right, right... what if R3000 simply said "1 VT is transferred from em
to the Bank, to be reported by the Chancellor" (i.e. this was pre-PC)?

I'm no longer so sure about that. When a CFJ is reassigned after
a failure to Judge, a Player who wasn't registered when the CFJ
was called is eligible to Judge it. (I think this is the feature
that led Andre to state that eligibility is assessed at the time
of assignment, which upon reflection is a perfectly reasonable
statement from the CotC's point of view, given that that is the
only time e has to worry about eligibility !)

There is therefore no strong reason to think that a Player who
wasn't a Player at the time a CFJ was called should be ineligible
to sit on an Appeal. (At least, the Rules do not provide such a
reason; I'd be in favor of clarifying the existing legislation
so that Players are only eligible to Judge a CFJ that was called
during their tenure as Players.)

Given that, one has to admit that 698 is silent on the matter of
whether non-Players are eligible or not - and rightly so; it should
make no difference - the Rules should only concern themselves with
Players (and let's make non-Player CFJs illegal, btw). I don't think
it even implicitly says anything about the matter, no matter what I
initially believed. Given that the Rules otherwise permit persons
who weren't Players when a CFJ was called to sit as Judges, it would
be more consistent to interpret them as allowing such Players to
sit as Justices.

In calculating the new value of X, we must perform two operations, an
addition and a multiplication.  And the addition comes second.
Therefore there is an ordering of sorts.  However, we might equally
well claim that the function is just computed all at once, by magic as
it were.  Fine.

Events, schmevents.  Where has this evil, perfidious "event" language
sprung from?  R594 says nothing about events.  

Two provisions does not equal two events, it equals a function
composed of two sub-functions, which can be computed just as magically
as the first example.

I would claim that nothing happens at all because the rule mandating
the transfer has disappeared.

This holds in the previous example too, so then, as here, nothing
untoward would happen to the person who attempted to remove the
Mintor.  I believe I was mistaken in taking the line I did in the
previous post.  I.e., the chancellor wouldn't be required to produce
the payment order after all. 

Sorry for any confusion.  (Me?  Confused? :-)

The assumption of infinitesimals amounts essentially to adding extra
numbers to the reals. There will then be a real number closest to a given
(not infinite) point of time, but there may be more than one point of time
infinitesimally close to a given real real.

You'd implement both provisions and end up with a Red Glork.

What is the "identity of a Mintor"? Don't you mean Executor?

I believe the usual programming language semantics is closer to

Temp = 2 X
X = Temp + 1

although a compiler will probably optimise this to work directly on X if
it is not some kind of object with side effects.

Is it?  You just asserted that something that Steve would apparently
assert to be one provision is, in your opinion, three provisions.
Clearly there is a disagreement between your intuition and Steve's. :)

An example Proposal for which I invite comments:

"The Ruleset, in its entirety, is repealed.  The following Rules are
enacted... [new Ruleset follows]."

Intuitively, the effect of this Proposal, if adopted, is to sweep out
the entire Ruleset and replace it _en toto_ with a new Ruleset as
specified in the Proposal.  Under the atomicity paradigm I suggest, it
does exactly that (assuming it has sufficient Power to actually repeal
the entire Ruleset).  Under the other paradigms suggested, the
Proposal will disintegrate somewhere along the way, when its
provision repeals the authority of Proposal to repeal Rules, or
perhaps in some other way.

Does Rule 114 speak to this issue?  

(In case anyone is interested, the Indiana legislature passed a law
that, in fact, did almost exactly what the Proposal I suggest above
did: it repealed nearly every statute and enacted a single Code that
encoded the previously existing law in a more orderly form than which
preceded it, without substantially changing the law.  The distinction,
of course, is that even with the entire statutory law repealed, the
State was still governed by its Constitution; Agora has no
Constitution.  But we can look at, for example, the adoption of the
California Constutition of 1879 as an example of such "clean sweep"
legislation at the highest governing level.  I do not believe that
legal scholars believe the governance of the law was interrupted by
these acts.)

I don't admit this condition.  I believe it should have the same

Where is the line between one provision and two?  Does "X is doubled,
and then incremented by 1" one provision or two?  What is the
difference between that and "X is replaced by twice its original
value, augmented by one?"  Lines in the sand. my friend.

With this I agree.  There is one event in Rule 594: the application of
the provisions of the Proposal.

If you use the word "transformation" instead of "function", I think
you make this argument without using mathematical language, which
would make me more comfortable. :)

The only substantial distinction I see here is in the case of
thumbtwiddles: a Proposal that changes a thing and then changes it
back to what it was previously.  Under the interpretation you advocate
(and with which I am in substantial agreement), this is a null
operation.  The counterpoint would argue that both operations occur.
Since this is a "pathological" case, I am not tempted to consider it
to be of great relevance in a discussion of the merits.

It depends on the opinions.  The Justices might very well find a basis
to rule on CFJ 933 that does not rely on making a determination, or
making a complete determination, on the issues we have been
discussing.  I can't say, since I am apparently not one of those

BTW, Andre, I think decisions are due in the Appeals of CFJ 940 and

Both provisions are implemented and the Glork is Red.  Provision 1 makes it
Red because Provision 2 is implemented and Provision 2 does not make it Blue
because Provision 1 is implemented.  There is nothing here to stop either
Provision from being implemented fully.

Re: Preliminary Recalculated Indulgence Report

Note: nothing in this message is to be construed as a PO - it is merely a
description of what will happen if CFJ 933 is sustained.

Here is the result of my preliminary calculations of what a sustained CFJ 933
will do to Indulgence holdings.  If anyone spots a mistake, let me know.

Ironically, this results in Harlequin's attempt at paying multiple POs with a
delayed TO to be resurrected (although it is still delayed waiting for Kolja's
delayed TO to take effect).  Of course e would have to cancel prior delayed TOs
in order to get it to work properly once.  I am tempted to reject all
outstanding delayed TOs once this is decided, as is my right under R1730.  I
note that it does not specify when I am allowed to do this - only that I inform
the executor (of course it will have to be before it takes effect).  Thoughts?

It assumes the weekly lottery POs were all invalid except for the first PO of
the first lottery (since there was 1 Indulgence in the Bank at that time).  To
be very precise, all the other POs should be vacated, but it would be easier if
we don't have to record them in the reports after the game state is back on
track.  Note that they have no effect on G. Chaos's PI infractions, since e was
already guilty of Indulgence PI in each week.

It does take into account POs that were in dispute at the time, and leaves out
POs that were judged invalid (specifically, two of elJefe's) or COE'd out of
existence.  BTW, since I did this by reconstructing events, the PO numbers are
different than the current set - just look at time stamps to make the match. 
If people really think it necessary, I will go back and renumber these to match
the old ones.

It does not include any Blots that would result from other PI infractions
caused by the lack of VTs or P-Notes.  These will have to be added in after
they are reported by the corrected reports of those currencies.

If we decide for a general amnesty on PI infractions caused by the unrealized
lack of funds, it will only affect Zefram in this case.  E is the only one who
was able to wipe out all Blots with "phantom" Indulgences.  If we do this,
Zefram will end up with only 2 Blots, not 4.

Anyway, here it is.

Well, I would hope that the majority of them were dismissed. :)

Looking through Rules currently in the Ruleset, and those Repealed
which I still have records of (those repealed in the last 6 months or so)
I found 5 Rules which had been Changed twice by the same proposal.
Three of these (206, 1322, & 1432) were an amendment and a mutation,
and thus would have the same result regardless of which order the changes
took place in.

Rule 833 was created and then had its number changed by Proposal
3474.  Rule 1551 was amended twice by Proposal 3445.  Both are
below for reference.

Either of these may have been during the time during the time
when Rule whatever-it-was explicitly stated that Rule Changes
in a Proposal were to be applied sequentially.  I don't know.

Archivist (or anyone), you might want to go and dig up
Rule 1551/1 and Proposal 3445.

Rule 833/9 (Power=1)
Awards & Penalties for Proposals

      The entity which paid the Petition fee for a given Proposal
      shall be known as the Sponsor of that Proposal.

      At the end of the Voting Period for a Proposal, if a Proposal
      has received more FOR Votes than AGAINST Votes, the Assessor
      shall pay out to the Sponsor a number of P-Notes equal to the
      number of FOR Votes less the number of AGAINST Votes.

      If, however, a Proposal has received more AGAINST Votes than FOR
      Votes, the Assessor shall bill the Sponsor for a number of
      P-Notes equal the number of AGAINST Votes less the number of FOR
      Votes.

      If the Sponsor and the Proposer of a Proposal are not the same
      entity and the Proposal passes, the Assessor shall pay out 2
      P-Notes to the Proposer.  If the Sponsor and the Proposer of a
      Proposal are not the same and the Proposal fails, the Assessor
      shall bill the Proposer 1 P-Note.  This is in addition to any
      other payments required by this or other Rules.

      For the purpose of this Rule, Votes by Voting Entities which are
      not Players do not count.

      The Assessor shall execute all Payment Orders required by this
      Rule no later than the time e announces the Voting Results of
      the Proposal in question.

History:
Created by Proposal 3474 (Swann), May 2 1997
Number changed from 1704 to 833 by Proposal 3474 (Swann), May 2 1997
[Note: An earlier Rule with Number 833 was amended 8 times; thus
 the amendment number.]
Amended(9) by Proposal 3533 (General Chaos), Jul. 15 1997, substantial

Originator: Swann
Authors: Swann, General Chaos

Rule 1551/4 (Power=1)
Documents Subject to Ratification

      The ratification of an Official Document conforms the Game State
      to what it would be if the valid Official Document thus ratified
      was completely true and accurate at the time of the Document's
      publication in the Public Forum.  In other words, the State of
      the Game, upon such ratification, becomes that specified within
      the Document, plus all subsequent legal changes between the time
      of its publication and its ratification.

      All Game State changes due to the ratification of an Official
      Document occur at the time of such ratification; no retroactive
      effect is expressed or implied.

      A Document, once ratified, is for all legal purposes a true and
      accurate report.  The Game State it references may not be
      retroactively modified prior to the time it was published in the
      Public Forum, even to reflect a prior mistake, retracted or
      illegal move, or an Injunction.  This Rule takes precedence over
      any Rule that would allow such retroactive alterations or
      corrections to the Game State.

      In no way does the ratification of a Document invalidate,
      reverse, alter or cancel any prior moves or transfers, even
      unrecorded or overlooked ones.  Nor does the ratification of a
      Document change the legality or illegality of any prior move.
      Ratification only adjusts the actual Game State to conform to
      that perceived by the Players and Officers in Official
      Documentation.

      After a Document has been ratified, the Player in charge of
      maintaining that Document shall annotate all subsequent
      publications of that Document with the date of publication of
      the last such publication that was ratified..

I think I've been arguing more about what the Rules should be than what
they are.  I don't have any strong feeling one way or the other
about the proper way to interpret the current Rules.  Although
I suppose that could be important to a judgement if it came
down to "the best interests of the game."

Hmm, now that I think of it, perhaps CFJ whichever (the one about
the COTC not being paid enough) isn't irrelevant to the Rules
after all--whether the COTC is paid enough could be relevant
if a CFJ about the COTC's salary came down to "the best interests
of the game."

I do note that if VTs were destroyed, Rule 1435 was never amended by
Propsoal 3543, and thus Indulgences have no Mintor.  This means,
amongst other things, that the Chancellor cannot create new
Indulgences.

Proposal 3445 was Proposal Reform.  The double-amendment of Rule 1551
was the result of a typo.

I believe I've shifted into this domain as well.  I have held, rather
steadfastly, that there really appears to be no strong claim for
either position within the established corpus of law, both statutory
and judicially constructed.

Ah!  Well said.  I like this model best as the goal of any new legislation
we might adopt on this issue.  Whether it applies to the current
situation, I don't know.

Correct.

I forgot to mention that I am assuming Indulgences survived as a Currency due
to higher precedence than the Currency destruction Rule.

I also forgot to mention that this preliminary report just brings things up to
date with the last Herald's Report.  Looks like I may be maintaining two
reports for a while.  8)

I disagree.  I believe "eligible" has been given a Special Meaning
within Agora, and thus just because non-Players are not included
in the pool from which Judges are selected does not make them
ineligible.

I see no reason why some proposals might not be implemented atomically
while others are implemented temporally, absent Rules to the contrary.
This is law, not religious dogma. So I certainly won't take 933 as any
sort of precedent on this issue. Were I to judge, I would likely take
the intent of the proposer(s) as my most important consideration.

Unfortunately, as stated, this will not solve anything wrt the current
argument.  What you mean by "no intermediates" will have to be carefully
spelled out, otherwise the question still is, what is that new game state at
the end of each provision application?  When calculating the effect of a single
provision, either you take *all* the Rules into account or you take only those
Rules into account that pertain to the legality of implementing the provision
(including those from previous provisions).  I agree with Steve that the
alternative of implementing all legal provisions, without respect to ordering
in this kind of calculation, can lead to the "new game state" being
indeterminate.

I think this is also what Michael is advocating, albeit somewhat more

There is no such beast.  Any such calculated game states are a
mathematical convenience only, and never really exist.  Just
as in implementing X <- 2X+1, one might calculate 2X, but the
factor never actually has the value 2X.

In this model, the entire proposal is a single provision.

No, Steve actually stated that e also thought the exact boundaries of
'a provision' are rather fluid (but in the above case e would agree,
as one rule change is one provision) - for the moment I'm absolutely
not worried by that.

Having just reread 3445, I think it might be relevant. For easy
reference by those of us who don't have access to complete archives,
here is that Proposal. I'll refrain from comments on whether this 
sheds light on the issues at hand or not.

Proposal 3445 by General Chaos (AI=3)
More Power to the People

This Proposal shall have Adoption Index 3.

{{ While not required presently, it will be after the changes in this
   Proposal take effect, and in any case such specifications are
   courteous to the Promotor. }}

Be it therefore resolved, that a Rule be created at MI=3, with the
title "Power" and the following text:

      There shall exist a property of entities known as Power.  The
      Power of an entity is an Index, as described elsewhere.

      An "instrument" is any entity with Power greater than zero.

      The Power of any given entity is zero until and unless it is set
      to another value in accordance with the Rules.

{{ This idea is somewhat borrowed from both Zefram and from ThinMan of
   Ackanomic.  I note, however, that care should be exercised in
   making things instruments; this Proposal does not establish a
   concept of a "limited instrument".  Thus SLCs should not be made
   instruments unless you want SLCs to be able to change Rules, for
   example. }}

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      Immediately upon the adoption of this Rule, each Rule's Power is
      set to be equal to its Mutability Index.

      Furthermore, the Power of the Proposal which created this Rule
      shall be set equal to 3.

      One second after this Rule is adopted, it shall repeal itself.

{{ Converts Mutability Indices to Power.  Self-repeal is required at
   this point because Proposals are not yet empowered to do anything
   other than Rule Changes and authorized Directives, and setting a
   Rule's Power is none of these things.  We also need to fix this
   Proposal's Power because otherwise this Proposal won't have one,
   and there's a single spot where it would break things if it
   doesn't. }}

Be it further resolved, that Rule 105 be amended to read:

      A Rule Change is any of the following:

      * The enactment of a new Rule;
      * The repeal of an existing Rule;
      * The amendment of the text of an existing Rule; or
      * Any change to a substantive property of a Rule other than
        its text.

      A "substantive property of a Rule" is any property of that
      Rule (other than its text) which determines in part or in full
      the ability of that Rule to govern by itself or in conjunction
      with other Rules.

{{ This defines a Rule Change inclusively as anything that changes a
   Rule, insuring that no Rule's ability to govern will be compromised
   except in accordance with the Rules peculiar to Rule Changes. }}

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1339 be amended to read:

      Exact precision is required in the specification of Rule
      Changes; any ambiguity or irregularity in the specification of a
      Rule Change causes it to be void and without effect.

      Variations in whitespace or capitalization in the quotation of
      text in an existing Rule to be removed or replaced does not
      create an irregularity or ambiguity, for the purpose of this
      Rule.  Any other variation, however, does.

{{ Rule 1339 has been gutted by this Proposal, mostly because Rule
   1339 is an ugly potluck of provisions relating to the specification
   of Rule Changes, most of which do not deserve 3/4 supermajority
   protection.  The other provisions from Rule 1339 are reintroduced
   elsewhere. }}

Be it further resolved, that Rules 1482 and 1030 be amended by
replacing every occurence of the phrase "Mutability Indices" with the
word "Power", and the phrase "Mutability Index" with the word "Power".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 594 be amended to read:

      When a Proposal is adopted, its Power becomes equal to its
      Adoption Index, and the provisions contained in the text of the
      Proposal are implemented to the maximal extent permitted by the
      Rules.  Provisions which are unclear, ambiguous, or inapplicable
      are ignored.  In a Proposal containing more than one provision,
      each provision is severable from the others, unless the Proposal
      states otherwise.

      For the purpose of the Rules, the application of an adopted
      Proposal is a legal procedure for changing Nomic Properties.

      The Adoption Index of a Proposal is the maximum of 1, the value
      requested by its Proposer (if any), and the value required for
      that Proposal by the Rules (if any).

{{ This is the heart of this Proposal.  Now, when a Proposal is
   adopted, it becomes an instrument, meaning whatever it says is
   supposed to happen happens.  Fuzzy provisions are ignored, but this
   doesn't affect other parts of the Proposal unless it says it does.
   The second paragraph grants adopted Proposals the power to change
   Nomic Properties directly.  And the third paragraph puts the
   obligation on the Proposer to choose a sufficiently high AI to
   adopt all the provisions in eir Proposal, rather than making the
   Promotor figure it out, while at the same time allowing Rules (like
   Silliness) to require a specific AI for certain types of Proposal.
   }}

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1606 be repealed.

{{ This is no longer needed; the new 594 completely destroys any need
   for 1606. }}

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1322 be amended to read:

      A given Rule Change shall not take effect unless the Power of
      the instrument which specified it is at least as great as the
      greater of the current Power of the Rule to be Changed (if any)
      and the Power the Rule would have after the Change (if any).

{{ Rephrased to use Power of instruments generally. }}

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be created, with Power 1, the
title "Power of New Rules" and the text:

      The Power of a new Rule shall be as specified by the instrument
      which causes the creation of that Rule; if no such specification
      exists, the Power of the new Rule shall be 1.

{{ This is one of the minor provisions of Rule 1339 that I promised
   would be moved elsewhere.  We need this provision in force now so
   we can create some new Rules later on. }}

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1021 ("Mutability Indices") be
repealed.

{{ At this point, there are no substantial references to Mutability
   Indices left in the Rules, every Rule has a Power, and we can
   create new Rules and know what their Power will be because of the
   Rule just created.  So we're done with MIs.  Byebye. }}

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be created, with Power 1, the
title "Category of New Rules" and the text:

      A new Rule shall be assigned to whatever Rule Category is
      specified by the instrument which created it, if the Rule
      Category specified exists.  If there is no such specification or
      a category which does not exist is specified, the Rulekeepor
      shall assign the Rule to an appropriate Rule Category of eir own
      choice.

{{ Another minor provision from 1339. }}

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be created, with Power 3, the
title "Power of Rules" and the text:

      No Rule may have Power less than 1 or greater than 4.

{{ The MI limit from 1274 comes back. }}

{{ The remainder of this Proposal seeks to eradicate any trace of
   Directives from the Ruleset. }}

Be it further resolved, that Rule 993 ("Directives") be repealed.

{{ Good riddance. }}

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1550 be retitled as "Ratification"
and amended to read:

      Any Official Document (as specified in other Rules) may be
      ratified by the operation of an adopted Proposal (but no other
      sort of instrument).  The instrument must specify an Official
      Document (as specified in other Rules) which is subject to
      ratification.

{{ My, this is much shorter than the original!  I'm rewording the VOC
   process as "ratification", in part because that's the proper term
   for it (votes of confidence are used to confirm people, not
   documents).  Also trimmed a great deal of excess verbiage. }}

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1551 be retitled as "Effect of
Ratification of Official Documents" and amended to read:

      The ratification of an Official Document conforms the Game State
      to what it would be if the valid Official Document thus ratified
      was completely true and accurate at the time of the Document's
      publication in the Public Forum.  In other words, the State of
      the Game, upon such ratification, becomes that specified within
      the Document, plus all subsequent legal changes between the time
      of its publication and its ratification.

      All Game State changes due to the ratification of an Official
      Document occur at the time of such ratification; no retroactive
      effect is expressed or implied.

      A Document, once ratified, is for all legal purposes a true and
      accurate report.  The Game State it references may not be
      retroactively modified prior to the time it was published in the
      Public Forum, even to reflect a prior mistake, retracted or
      illegal move, or an Injunction.  This Rule takes precedence over
      any Rule that would allow such retroactive alterations or
      corrections to the Game State.

      In no way does the ratification of a Document invalidate,
      reverse, alter or cancel any prior moves or transfers, even
      unrecorded or overlooked ones.  Nor does the ratification of a
      Document change the legality or illegality of any prior move.
      Ratification only adjusts the actual Game State to conform to
      that perceived by the Players and Officers in Official
      Documentation.

      After a Document has been ratified, the Player in charge of
      maintaining that Document shall annotate all subsequent
      publications of that Document with the date of publication of
      the last such publication that was ratified..

{{ this may seem long, but it's 2 lines shorter than the original. }}

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1551 be retitled "Documents Subject
to Ratification" and amended as follows:

   a) In the first paragraph, replace "to be valid for the purpose of
      a Vote of Confidence (VOC) Directive" with "to be subject to
      ratification";
   b) in the first paragraph, replace "the VOC Directive"
      with "the Proposal which seeks to ratify it";
   c) in the first element "vi", replace "all VOC Directives" with
      "ratification";
   d) replace the entire paragraph beginning "Further, a Document",
      with "Further, a Document is not subject to being ratified if
      any of the following occur during the Voting Period of a
      Proposal which seeks to ratify it:"; and
   e) in the second element "i", and the second element "ii", and the
      final paragraph of the Rule, replace "the VOC Directive's Voting
      Period" with "the Voting Period of the Proposal which seeks to
      ratify it".

For the purposes of the interpretation of the above amendment, an
"element" is a paragraph of a Rule which begins with a lowercase roman
numeral followed by a right parenthesis.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1054 ("Changing the Category of a
Rule") be repealed.

{{ Rule 1054 is now completely unnecessary, as sufficient force exists
   to change a Rule's Category by Proposal directly, via Rule 594. }}

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1052 ("Creating New Rule
Categories") be repealed.

{{ The first paragraph of Rule 1052 is no longer needed for the same
   reason Rule 1054 is no longer needed.  And its second paragraph is
   replicated in substance in Rule 1681. }}

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1524 ("Directive to Change the Name
of a Category") be repealed.

{{ Same thing as 1054. }}

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1485 ("Titles for Rules") be
amended, by deleting the paragraph reading:

      A Rule's Title may be changed by a Directive.  The Directive
      must unambiguously state the number of the Rule and the new
      Title.

{{ Same thing again. }}

Be it further resolved, that Rule 649 be amended to read:

      Let there exist a class of entities known as Patent Titles.
      Patent Titles may be possessed only by persons.  The awarding of
      Patent Titles will generally be by Proposal, but this should not
      be taken to preclude any other means of award.

      The Registrar shall maintain a list of all Patent Titles that
      have been awarded, and to whom they have been awarded.  This
      list is known as the Gold Pages, and is part of the Registrar's
      Report.

{{ Drastically simplified by not having to specify details about the
   mechanism for the award of Patent Titles. }}

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1044 be amended to read:

      Let there exist a class of Patent Titles known as Unique Patent
      Titles.  At most one person may hold a specific Unique Patent
      Title at any one time.  Unique Patent Titles are the same as
      Patent Titles in all other respects.

{{ UPTs are just Unique Patent Titles.  So rather than restating
   ourselves, we just inherit. }}

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1370 be amended to read:

      A Degree is awarded by the operation of an instrument of
      sufficient Power specifying the Degree to be awarded, and its
      recipient.  The sufficient Power required to award a Degree is
      determined by the Degree to be awarded.  All conditions
      established by this and other Rules for the awarding of the
      named Degree must have been fulfilled before the Degree may be
      awarded.

      No Degree may be awarded to any recipient unless the recipient
      has posted a Thesis to the Public Forum authored by eirself,
      along with a statement explicitly indicating that the Thesis is
      being submitted with the intent to qualify for a Degree.  The
      Archivist shall retain a copy of each Thesis posted in this
      manner.

      The Degree of Bachelor of Nomic shall not be awarded unless the
      Thesis submitted for that Degree contains at least 500 words,
      and unless the instrument awarding the Degree has Power of at
      least 1.

      The Degree of Doctor of Nomic History shall not be awarded
      unless the Thesis submitted for that Degree contains at least
      500 words and contains a narrative covering significant events
      which have occured in Agora within at least the last eight
      weeks, and unless the instrument awarding the Degree has Power
      of at least 2.

      The Degree of Master of Nomic shall not be awarded unless the
      Thesis submitted for that Degree contains at least 500 words,
      and unless the instrument awarding the Degree has Power of at
      least 2.

      The Degree of Doctor of Nomic Philosophy shall not be awarded
      unless the Thesis submitted for that Degree contains at least
      500 words, unless the intended recipient has also posted in the
      Public Forum an additional creative work authored by emself
      whose topic or theme is related to Agora or Nomic in general,
      and unless the instrument awarding the Degree has Power of at
      least 3.

{{ This is just restatement; there is no substantial change in effect.
}}

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1466 ("Currency Directives") be
repealed.

{{ Currencies can be transferred or otherwise manipulated directly by
   Proposal. }}

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1589 be amended by replacing
"Notwithstanding any other method which may be defined, a SLC can
always be changed by the adoption of a Directive to amend the SLC. The
Proposal containing such a Directive shall have an AI of at least 1,
and if adopted the Directive has the effect of modifying the SLC in
the manner specified in the Directive." with "Notwithstanding any
other method which may be defined, a SLC may always be changed by the
operation of an instrument of Power 1 or greater."

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1008 be amended, by replacing "This
Patent Title shall never be awarded or revoked by Directive." with
"This Patent Title shall not be awarded or revoked except as specified
in this Rule; this Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would
permit otherwise."

But you still need some method of making that calculation.  What do you propose
that method should be?

This seems to me to just beg the question.  You still have to have some means
of determining the "new game state" at the end of each of the three game state
changes in the above example.  You can't just hand wave this and say it doesn't
matter, we just look at the new game state at the end, since it's a single
provision.  The thing you are calling a "mathematical convenience" is crucial
to being able to determine the exact result of the provision(s), otherwise you
end up with an indeterminate final new game state.  The argument here centers
around exactly which "mathematical convenience" we are going to use - one that
includes collateral effects of Rules on the intermediate step or one that does
not.

Maybe not.  Although the history of 1551 indicates that I applied
the amendments in the order in which they appeared (was this
when the Rules still explicitly specified that, though?), the
result is the same no matter which order they are applied in.

Um, one that does not, I think.  I'm not really sure I understand
what you're saying.  Perhaps you could give an example?  (Yeah, I
know we've had examples galore in this thread already, but
I haven't been paying close attention to all of them.)

Actually, I would say that there would be several provisions, but in the
application of a proposal, the game state changes directly to the game
state that is the result of applying all of the provisions to the game state.

Proto-proposal:

===
Rule 594 is amended to read:

When a Proposal is adopted, its Power becomes equal to its Adoption Index,
and the provisions contained in the text of the Proposal are implemented
sequentially on an exact duplicate of the Game State and to the maximal
extent permitted by the rules.  While these provisions are being
implemented, the Rules may have no effect on the game state other than
preventing a provision from being applied to it.  Provisions which are
unclear, ambiguous, inapplicable, or base their applicability upon later
provisions are ignored.  After all of the provisions in the Proposal have
been processed in this way, the Game State becomes the duplicate of the
Game State which all of the provisions were applied to unless the Proposal
has been determined to have no effect as described in the Proposal.

For the purpose of the Rules, the application of an adopted Proposal is a
legal procedure for changing Nomic Properties.

The Adoption Index of a Proposal is the maximum of 1, the value requested
by its Proposer (if any), and the value required for that Proposal by the
Rules (if any).
===

The "unless the Proposal has been determined to have no effect as described
in the Proposal" is meant so that proposers may add the clause "If any
provision of this Proposal are not implemented, this Proposal has no effect."

Is that unclear in any way?

I take your point and agree with it to a degree. But provisions usually
_do_ commute in real Proposals.

This kind of deference to a Judge should not apply when the Judge and the
Caller are the same person.  In that case I would say there is a special
duty for the Justices to examine the Statement's truth or falsity.

What a wonderful discussion, with lots of twists and turns I would not have
thought of!  I remember a slight uneasiness about Rule 594/3 when we passed
it, but never thought that it would admit three different theories of how
it operates.  Thanks, everyone!

Rule 594/2 did require the implementation of rule changes in the order they
occur within the Proposal (Interestingly, directives were handled in a
different Rule, and they used to be implemented in order too, but the order
in which they might be interleaved with Rule Changes was undefined...)

We amended that requirement out of the Rule.  Now we appear to have three
possible theories of how provisions are implemented:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.) (The Sequential School)  Each provision is implemented in order, if
allowed by the Rules then in effect, and the Game State is adjusted to
include consequent effects of this before turning to the next provision.

2.) (The Atomic School)  Each provision is implemented in order, if allowed
by the Rules in effect at the adoption of the Proposal, but no consequent
effects cause an adjustment to the Game State until all provisions have
been dealt with.

3.) (The Simultaneous View) All the provisions are considered to be
implemented simultaneously, except where dependencies among the provisions
require that some are implemented in sequence with other ones.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------


All three of these appear to be possible interpretations of the Rules.  Is
there any decisive reason to favor one of them from the point of view of
Game Custom, Commonsense, etc., etc.?


NOTES:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
(A.)  Even assuming strict sequentialism, a "provision" does not
necessarily mean "a single Rule change".  For example:

"NotaProposal (AI=3.1)
 ------------
 Provision 1. ElJefe wins the game.
 Provision 2. All the Rules are Repealed."

I'd ask that Proponents be prepared to state what effect this has...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
(B.)  Implicit in some arguments is the notion that events are strictly
ordered as to time, and that simultaneous occurrence is incoherent.  This
is not the view of real-life legal systems.

In fact there is an ancient legal conundrum which involves the assumption
of strictly ordered events.  A childless husband and wife who tragically
die in the same accident; of course they named each other as heir. The
question was which one died later, by even a fraction of a second (since
then their blood relations, and not those of the other spouse, inherit
_all_ the assets).

I believe most jurisdictions have adopted the rule (and most competent
wills have it written in anyway) that in such a case they are presumed
(deemed?) to have died simultaneously, unless one survived the other by a
specified period (like a month).

It has been pointed out that we _could_ order events if we wish to,
breaking a time-stamp tie by which one got to the PF first, or whatever.
This case is telling us that RL legal systems do not always find it
necessary to break temporal ties, and in fact that there may be merit in
refraining from doing so.

Not that we need to mirror RL.  But it would be ironic if Agora adopted a
view that restricts our options _more_ tightly than RL systems of law.
:-)

Many regards to all,
-- elJefe

One good thing about the Antimatter CFJs is that they are going to
rid us of the dead wood : any Players who Fail to Judge before the 
end of this month will be all of a sudden Deregistered for 
Lawlessness.

Informal request of the CotC : could you please find the time to
post a list of those Players who have yet to Judge, or Dismiss, the
Antimatter CFJs ? I want to count potential Lounge inductees. ;)

Er, there you go, "This message contains a file prepared for
transmission using the MIME BASE64 transfer encoding scheme." Which
is the text of P1759 and 1760. Doesn't your mailer handle MIME
attachments ? I can send it in another format, though mine does have
trouble with editing text buffers > 32k, which is why I sent it as
an attachment.

Oh right, you mean the Zombies. I understand elJefe's statement
better now, but I am still puzzled - 933 was called by Crito. Unless
there's a gaping hole in my memory, I have yet to be assigned, for
Elde or Blob, a CFJ which I myself called, which is the reason for my
bafflement at elJefe's post.

Why make that conditional on my dismissal ?

The two messages were separated by about 30 others on my system, and I
didn't see the MIME bomb until quite some time later.

My system can handle mail messages up to 1 megabyte, and that limit is
actually arbitrarily set in sendmail.cf.  In theory I'm only limited
by available disk space.

Hmm, that's a misfeature of Pegasus, then... Or maybe it's me, there 
must be some way to do that kind of thing correctly.

Yes, but then you don't have a nice application bar with a small
animated arrow that points at it with a cute message saying 'Start
here' when you boot up your machine.

Windows 95 is so nice. ;)

Not really.  Messages sent separately cannot be assured of being
delivered together.  Especially when they start in France, get bounced
through Australia, and then meander across a UUCP link that originates
in California and ends in Indiana.

I always find it interesting when Agora starts to parallel Magic: The 
Gathering.  Magic recently changed a rule that exactly corresponds to this.  
For a while, card abilities and game rules which said things like "whenever X 
happens, do Y" were evaluated continuously, even in the middle of resolving 
spells.  For example, there's a creature called Maro which has power and 
toughness equal to the number of cards in its controller's hand, and an 
automatic game action to destroy any creature with zero toughness.  A spell 
called "Wheel of Fortune" says "All players must discard their hands and draw 
seven new cards."  It was ruled that if you had a Maro in play when Wheel of 
Fortune was cast, it would be destroyed, since momentarily you had zero cards 
in hand.  As players started poking around the edges of this ruling, things 
got more and more complicated.  Finally they changed the rule to say that you 
only check for such effects at the end of the resolution, or at the word 
"then" if a card is written in a "do A, then do B" format.  Instructions in 
text without a "then" are specifically defined to be simultaneous but ordered.

Oh, and I've been meaning to post a quote, but hadn't gotten around to it.  
This is displayed on a poster at the business meetings of Worldcon (the World 
Science Fiction Convention), where parliamentary procedure occasionally gets 
as bizarre as some of the Agora discussions.  (I remember one great meeting, 
though I think it may have been a Westercon, where motions and amendments and 
this-n-thats were nested about 6 levels deep... and after they finally 
unravelled, the one who made the motion that started the whole thing 
innocently pointed out that he had phrased it as a question rather than an 
actual motion, so none of that actually happened.)  Anyway, I thought y'all 
would appreciate this.

Ah, but that's the point.  The method embodied in the Rules as a whole, or just
some subset of the Rules (i.e. without collateral effects)?

The best example is the current crisis.  One of the game state changes was the
destruction of the Mint.  If we agree on a total ordering of the provisions,
then you calculate, using your "mathematical convenience", the game state
immediately after the destruction of the Mint.  If you are using the Rules as a
whole, with collateral effects, to calculate this intermediate game state, then
you have just destroyed VTs and P-Notes, and none of the following provisions
in the proposal did anything to bring them back so that the final game state
reached at the end of this "black box" contains no VTs or P-Notes.  However, if
you ignore collateral effects (what I earlier called "indirect changes", then
VTs and P-Notes survive - but then you haven't used the Rules as a whole to
calculate the new game state.  So how do we justify ignoring collateral effects
in these calculations?

In my opinion, it's because the Rules regarding things like Mintors
have no application to the implementation of Rule Changes.  As far as
the Mintor question is concerned, by the time the Rule pertaining to
Mintorless Currencies gets a look at the Game State, VTs have a
Mintor.  A different Mintor than the one they had before, but a Mintor
nonetheless.  And thus the provision in question is not activated,
because it's not true.
