>>PROTO#2: Auto-Ratification

Is this really helpful with a time of two months? Most of the problems
we had recently were concerned with changes within the last two
months; on the other hand, reports of exactly two months ago already
contained some things we wanted to correct. If the last obviously
correct state of things is one of, say, 10 weeks ago, this will
complicate things rather than simplify a reconstruction of the game
state. 

>>PROTO#3: Inform the Assessor whence come yer Votes

Reasonable way to simplify the officer's work. I assume that this
information would have to be true under 1497,

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of a message to an Officer which that
      Officer is then required to act upon commits the Crime of
      Falsification, a Class C Crime.

right?

>>PROTO#4: Officer's Veto

I'd support this. Also because it would give officers some office
related power - we've been talking about this a lot, but not much has
happened in this direction so far.

I think that with only seven days from the assignment of a CFJ to the
deadline for the judgement there won't be enough time to get evidence
for all relevant facts. All requests for information are tied to
asap-timing, so everyone who has relevant information that is not
public (say, part of a report) can prevent timely judgements by
delaying the info.

To make this work you'll have to give judges more time - I'm not sure
whether such delays are an acceptable price for the higher judicial
standards of evidence you're trying to introduce.

I would have vacated them myself, being a reasonable person.  Were I
to be unreasonable, a judicial finding consequent to a CFJ would have
empowered a Judge to vacate them as well.  There is no automatic
anything under the Omnibus Reform.

(I admit that my grammar was a bit contorted.)

Then dismiss the CFJ for lack of evidence.  I would prefer that to a
possibly wrong Judgement based on inadequate or no evidence.

Not to mention that Judges have no power to require the presentation
of evidence, beyond that which they have pursuant to the Freedom of
Information Act.  I intend to, in the coming months, grant Judges such
a power as well as to replace the simple 7 day deliberation period
with a more flexible system that, hopefully, will balance the general
interest of speedy justice with the need for sufficient time for
interested parties topresent relevant evidence and arguments and for
the Judge to evaluate it.  In complex cases, especially involving
uncooperative Players, this may delay Judgement, in some cases
substantially, but in the typical case should not slow the process
down significantly, if at all.

Justice should be swift, but it should not be overly so.  I would
prefer longer deliberations resulting in correct findings to shorter
ones resulting in incorrect ones.  

Aside from that, Agora has basically no Rules at all regarding matters
of fact in judicial affairs.  This is probably due in substantial part
to there having been very few instances where the facts of a case have
been unclear; in the vast majority of CFJs, the dispute at hand has
been one of law or of the application of law to fact, not one of
fact.  If this trend continues, the proposed standard will only
infrequently affect the judicial process.

Well, since it would give me some extra power, I wouldn't have a problem with

Actually, though, I like your idea for a Proposal Queue better.

It's Blob's baby now, so to speak, but I would like to say that I
think the person who gets to do the voluntary lifting of things from
priority zero to one should be the Speaker and not the Promotor.  Not
that I have anything against you Crito :-) it's just that this fits
better with the nature of what it is to be Speaker, and is perhaps
another nice perk for that job.  

But hey, this is a minor quibble.  As long as someone gets a little
power to play around with, this has my full support. 

Michael.

I was thinking that a nice addition would be to extend this power to
the Speaker as well (both of them).  I'll support either or both (or
even neither, for that matter).

Considering that it was submitted by Ackanomic, I suspect this falls
firmly into the category of "trinket".  (Recall their efforts a while
back to make it possible to trade useless trinkets between Nomics?)

I keep wanting to scream when I see that paragraph.  Read one way it is
redundant (_of course_ Officer Reports are our most important form of
evidence)  and read another way it is wedging an axe between perceived and
actual game state.

Thinking about this, as our Game is slowly being dragged screamingly from
its original state of mostly automatic, unbreakable Rules, into being
based on breakable Player obligations, it would seem reasonable to give a
Judge wide powers to reverse indirect benefits (such as Wins, Currencies,
Patent Titles, and passage of Rule Changes) which a Player has achieved
through willful Rule Violation.

I first thought "NO WAY" but it's looking better each time.  It might have
the added benefit of regulating P-Note Inflation.

This could cause the Queue to get large.

One idea would be to reduce Priority (by 0.2, say) once per Week, with
Proposals that go negative removed.

Suggestion:  Change "Player" to "Entity", so that Contests and Groups may
also Sponsor Proposals.

I am here imagining philantropic Contests supporting "trivial" Proposals
like simple error corrections, which a Player might not bother to pay for
alone, but which are for the common good.  I.e. disinterested ones.

  Opposed. I like Steve's way better; you can break the Rules, but expect

to pay the penalty for doing so. And this would require introducing an
artificial
distinction between Rule violation and the commission of Infractions and
Crimes;
I'm sure all here will remember that several successful Scams - and some
nice ones
at that - involved perpetrating a number of Infractions. (In some cases,
a *large*
number of them).

Evidentiary status has nothing to do with our perception of the game state, or

with the determination of the actual properties of same; such a Rule would
merely obligate Judges to consider an Officer's Report a more reliable
indication of what the actual game state is than they would most other types
of information presented to them in the course of a judicial proceeding.

The point of this is to free Officers from having to constantly
crossverify each other's work.  Presently, an Officer may not assume
that another Officer's report is valid, but must instead (to be legal
and proper) independently verify that Officer's computations and
determinations for correctness before basing eir own reports upon
them.  This has become increasingly onerous as the Game has become
more complex.

It would still possible to challenge an Officer's report, but the
burden of proof would lie on the challenger, not the Officer.  And my
feelings about differences between the perceived and actual game state
are well-known. :)

Could someone explain to me why some Players feel it necessary to
claim errors in their own reports?  It's sufficient, as far as I am
concerned, to merely announce the correction.

The distinction already exists.  There is nothing in the Rules
that states that an Infraction or Crime can result only from
illegal activity.  (Not that I'm disagreeing with you about the
proto, I'm just pointing this out.)

NetDIVE> Isn't that exactly the current system ?

No.  The current system has no concept of personal liability for
illegal actions.  It is presently possible (in fact, quite easy) to
profit from illegal actions, something that would not be the case if
we had a working body of tort law.

The distinction is already there, as far as I am concerned;  There is an
expectation that Players will not plan to break the Rules. If someone e.g.
Won by willfully Violating the Rules, I for one would (1) Call them an
extremely bad sport (2) Propose to nullify their Win.

You could always try to change the Game into what you describe... I think
a properly symbolic way would be to Amend Rule 101.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

DIS: Re: BUS: COE on latest Herald's Report

I seem to recall a time when it *was* necessary to do this in order to change
official reports.  I guess this is just a hold-over from that time - playing it
safe.

Could someone explain to me why some Players feel it necessary to
claim errors in their own reports?  It's sufficient, as far as I am
concerned, to merely announce the correction.

I understand the goal and even support it, I just don't think the Proto is
sufficient from a Platonic point of view.

Actually what seems to be needed is a (high-powered) Rule about how this
Evidence actually affects the work of Officers and the Game in general.
First try, based on the last paragraph of 1598:

      The legality and effect of a procedure to change the Game State
      shall be determined using the best evidence available to the
      person or persons carrying out the procedure.  Such a person's
      reasonable and good faith determination that the procedure is legal
      and effective is definitive, even if it is based on erroneous
      information.

I am not sure whether that should be Player or person - I think using
"person" will be nice in the case of uncertainty about Playerhood, as well
as for the few cases when non-Players can do things.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

This has (at least) one fatal flaw: what if two people, both acting in
reasonable good faith, come to differing conclusions as to the
legality or effect of some procedure?

Actually, I can see a couple more problems myself.

Second attempt:

Sub-PROTO Effectiveness Determination (version 2)

      The legality and effect of a step of a procedure to change the
      Game State shall be determined using the best evidence available
      to the person primarily responsible for reporting the outcome of
      the procedural step.  Such a person's reasonable and good faith
      determination of whether the procedural step is legal and
      effective is definitive, even if it is based on erroneous
      information.

[2: Attempted to make only one person responsible.
Added "step" to handle e.g. Proposals which are handled in several
steps by more than one Officer.
Also changed "determination that" into "determination of whether"]

END Sub-PROTO


Next fatal flaw, please :-)

Greetings,
Ørjan.

I meant to talk to you about that. I understand why you want the power to
go to the Speaker, but I am on a campaign to spread discretionary powers
around a bit, so that all Officers get some kind of perks.

I think I constructed a list of possibilities for other Officers, once upon
a time. I'll see if I can dig it up.

True. Is this necessarily a problem? I suppose there should be some way
to drop ancient proposals from the Queue. Hsm.

This would mean that un-sponsored proposals would drop out after a week.
How about this instead: Priority decreases over time, but never below zero.
The Promotor may, at eir discretion, drop any zero-priority proposals which
are over (say) a month old.

Good idea. I'll make the change.

Orjan> Next fatal flaw, please :-)

You asked: The second sentence prohibits error correction for innocent
errors which occur reasonably and in good faith.  It also forecloses
CFJs on such errors, by making the result of a erroneus determination
correct as a matter of law.  If asked to Judge whether such a
determination was correct, I would be forced to find that it was, as a
matter of law, even though it was incorrect, as a matter of fact,
because Judgements must accord with the Rules, but need not accord
with fact.  My proto does not suffer from this failing because it
allows for "clear" evidence to set aside the presumption; your proto
leaves no avenue to demonstrate an determination to be in error
because the act of making a determination in good faith changes the
"game state" to reflect that determination, thereby making that
determination irretrivably correct.

'Perpetual Indebtness'? It's a bit soon to say that, surely...

Goodness, a siginificant expansion of Judicial power! I guess we

What's the point of asking Harlequin to deny his own Win? Surely the
thing to do in a case such as this is to make a CFJ, barring Harlequin.

I would reject this argument. It is based on a false assumption that
the word 'vote' has only one meaning and can only be used in one way.
In fact, the word 'vote' is equivocal between the act of voting on
the one hand, and whatever it is that gets tallied at the end of the
VP on the other.  The meaning of the word on particular occasions of
its use must be determined from context, and I would say that in the
context of R1729, it very clearly has the first meaning in the clause
"Nor shall a Player Vote in public", and reasonably clearly has the
second meaning in the clause "And should it occur (due to greed or
sin) / that no one Votes FOR it, the Proposer shall Win."

This line of argument is interesting and had not occurred to me before.
I'll leave to a Judge, if there eventually is one, to determine what
weight to give it.

I think there should be penalties for breaking the Rules. I can see
no reason for treating some violations differently to others just
because they are dignified with a name.

Should I take it that you don't like my proto to amend R833?
It replaces the complications and profligacy of the current Rule
with a simple and modest reward of 2 VTs for getting one or more
Proposals passed in a given week. I think there should be some
reward for making Proposals and getting them adopted.

Whoops, yes.  I removed it from the body of the Ruleset but
not from the ToC.  Thanks for pointing it out.

Proto-Proposal
Real VT scarcity *now*

[Comment: as promised, a proto for real VT scarcity, now. I've opted
for direct VT destruction for getting VTs back, rather than the much
more complex issuing of POs by the Chancellor, which would require
each Executor to make a Transfer Order returning their VTs to the
Bank. The paying out of VTs can be done simply by issuing TOs from
the Bank by the Chancellor, though, so I've opted for that. I note
that PC appears to have negated that effects of reforming R594: we're
back to the situation where you need to propose self-repealing Rules
to make game state changes by Proposal.]

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule be created with the following text:

      Upon the creation of this Rule, all Voting Tokens are
      destroyed.  Furthermore, as soon as possible after the creation
      of this Rule, the Chancellor shall execute Transfer Orders
      for five Voting Tokens to each Player naming the Bank as Payor.

      This Rule shall repeal itself as soon as the Chancellor
      has executed the Transfer Orders required by it.
####

Any problems with this, Scott?

Yes, "surely" that is the thing to do.  I have my reasons, which
will be revealed in due time.

Good point.  This will probably have to go to a CFJ.

Judicial Orders (in the Omnibus Reform) can be quite powerful;
however, if you look closely you will note that no Order can act to
prevent its own appeal.  I have not forgotten Lindrum. :)

The question of ultimate authority is interesting.

In the US federal system, there is no constitutional means to
challenge an order of the Supreme Court, except by demanding it
reconsider its opinion.  However, the Supreme Court has rarely
utilized this ultimate authority in a manner that is even arguably
inconsistent with its constitutional mandate (see _Marbury v. Madison_
as perhaps the best example of the Court extending its own power).
Similarly, the French constitution grants the President the power to
unilaterally declare an emergency, making the President almost
monarchal in authority; a state of emergency can only be ended by the
President.  Yet this power has never been abused.  In the British
system, the monarch, in theory, can do anything, but in practice is
strongly limited, by custom if not by law.

To a great extent, these nonwritten limitations on the power of
ultimate authorities are based on the fact that abuse of these powers
will result in revolt.  To my knowledge, there is no working
government that does not have some body (either one individual or a
small group of individuals) who effectively hold ultimate authority
but are restrained in its use by custom or other unwritten law (rather
than written constitution or statute) or the fear of civil revolt.  I
wonder if this is a structural necessity.

Chuck is correct.  I have discovered an, um,
idiosyncracy in some Microsoft software when
importing text into a database.  I've found a way
around it, so that my new count matches Chuck's. 
In the tradition of correcting for bad random
percentages, I have pulled 5 more numbers with the
correct random percentage - all were less than
287, so the original selections will stand
(fortunately).
