I have noticed that the Registrar broke Rule 1494 when he welcomed me to
Agora. I was considering a CFJ to have em pay a blot or 4, but I was
assured that CFJs are not usually called for inadvertant errors. Oh
well, it might have been nice to start out with a CFJ. So instead, I'm
just making it known so that e might rectify the situation (and perhaps
be slightly shamed ;o).

R1494 states

     The Registrar, in consultation with the Speaker, shall develop and
     maintain a Welcome Message, welcoming a new player to Agora Nomic,
     explaining any subscriptions required to receive the Public Forum,
     how to obtain a current ruleset, and any other information, advice,
     and gossip as the Registrar sees fit. The Registrar shall send a
     copy of the Welcome Message to any Player who Registers for the
     first time, within a week of such Registration.

The welcome message I received from em did not tell me how to obtain a
current ruleset. I discovered that I should receive a copy each week as
a matter of course. But this was discovered by my own reading of the old
ruleset which I had obtained. Therefore either; 1)  The Registrar did
not send me the maintained Welcome Message.  or 2)  The Registrar sent
me the Welcome Message, but it was inadequate as it did not have the
required information.

I have been told that the Welcome Message is currently blank and that
the rules don't allow for a new one to be written. My response to that
is that adding information to a deficient document should fall within
the realms of "develop and maintain".  :o)

Incidentally, I think the actual steps needed for subscription should be
included also for newbies like myself who have never met a majordomo
before.

Thank you Kolja.  All gifts gratefully accepted.
My vote can not be bought (but it can certainly be encouraged ;o).
I don't mind your current pair of proposals, so they will be voted for.
