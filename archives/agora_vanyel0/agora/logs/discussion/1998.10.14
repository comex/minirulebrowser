Lee's last recorded reports for Accountor and Cartographor were made
on 21 September, as my report says.

This falls into the week 21 - 27 Sep.

He didn't report in the week 28 Sep - 4 Oct, and he has been penalised
for that (in my last salaries report).

I have yet to produce a salaries report for 5 Oct - 11 Oct, but it
seems that he will again be penalised, though it's possible I've
missed a report for that week so I will be checking my mail logs
first.  He will be guilty of Dereliction of Duty if this is the case
and he doesn't report this week either.

Michael.

With many thanks to Macross for the inspiration...

Proto-Proposal
A Duty to Propose

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "A Duty to Propose", be
created with the following text:

      Every Player has a Public Service Status which takes exactly one
      of the values: Served, or Required to Serve. Initially, every
      Player Status is Served. The Promotor shall maintain a list of
      all Players, including for each Player eir Public Service Status,
      and the time at which eir Status last changed to Served. The list
      shall be sorted according to when each Player's Status last
      changed to Served, from least recently to most recently, with ties
      being broken alphabetically. The Promotor shall include this list
      in eir Promotor's Report.

      As soon as possible after the beginning of each Week, the
      Promotor shall select the two Active Players not in their Grace
      Periods highest on the list who are not already Required to Serve,
      and change their Statuses from Served to Required to Serve, by
      announcing this change in the Public Forum.

      Any Player who is Required to Serve continuously for 14 days has
      their Status changed to Served and commits the Infraction of
      Failure to Propose, incurring a penalty of 1 Blot and 1 P-Note, to
      be detected and reported by the Promotor.

      Whenever any Player submits a Proposal, eir Public Service Status
      changes to (or remains as) Served. 

####

Notes:

1. Macross' original draft would require the Registrar to undertake the
fairly arduous task of discovering, for each Player, the time when that
Player last submitted a Proposal. I avoid this by sorting according to
the time of last change of Public Service Status to Served. However,
this creates a new problem, in that this does not specify an ordering
when the Rule is initially created and no Players have Served. I solve
this problem by specifying that ties are broken alphabetically, which
effectively means that the initial list will be alphabetically sorted,
and thereafter be sorted by time of most recent Proposal submission.
Macross' idea of using the time of submission to sort the list is clever
because it simplifies the selection algorithm: you don't need a special
way of marking Players who have missed their turns due to being On Hold,
because a Player will get to the top of the list once it is their turn
and stay there until they make a Proposal. However, there is a price to
be paid for this simplification: either the Registrar will now need to
keep track of dates of Proposal submission, which is the natural domain
of the Promotor, or, if we give the job back to the Promotor, the
Promotor will have to keep track of Player Activity, which is the job of
the Registrar. I've chosen to hand the job back to the Promotor, since
making Proposals will be more frequent than changes in Activity.

2. Macross' original draft also contains special treatment for Players
On Hold, probably a hangover my proto. In working out this version, I
realized (I think) that this is not necessary. As suggested above, once
a Player gets to the top of the list (ie is the Experienced Player who
has least recently submitted a Proposal), they will stay there until
they submit a Proposal, which they will be required to do in the first
week after they come Off Hold.

3. As long as we adopt the proto currently floating about to make
Proposal submission an act performed in the PF, the last paragraph
should be OK. (There's no good reason to make the change in Status in
this case be triggerred by an action of the Registrar's rather than the
submitting Player's.)

4. I tried a version of this with no Statuses at all, just a list sorted
by time of last Proposal submission (after the creation of the Rule,
with ties being broken alphabetically, as above). It didn't work. The
problem is what to do with Players who are already Required to Serve (in
the sense defined above) but haven't submitted a Proposal after a week.
If there's nothing to indicate that the Rule has already affected them,
then they stay at the top of the list and get hit with another
requirement. (There are other problems, too.) The proto avoids this
problem because "the time of last change to Served status" is not
equivalent to "the time of last Proposal submission" in every case.

You did not, penalize away.  I will try to gather everything together
and report once i have my computer back (this is from one at work).

Would someone like to be the cartographer?  

I know no one wants to be the accountor.  

Really, this current system is very burdensome.  I want to try to
streamline the process, but so far my effort have been futile.  

I would love to see a trial run of free voting for a month or so, so i
can try to catch up on the report and then we will know if we like free
voting.  I was almost there, but since the new tos and pos pile up when
 i make revisions, and the reports are cumulative, it has been like
running up the down escalator.

It is not just the expense of voting that has cause a drop in it.  One
player expressed that they would vote on something if they felt they
would remember to and have the energy to pay for it as well.   I fondly
remember the good old days of free voting.

So let's go for free voting.

Scott, are you happy with your present version of this proto? I'd also
like to see the Ambassador stuff repealed as soon as possible - if we
make up our minds to simplify the game, then let's not wait too long.

Actually, I think I tried to propose them a while ago, but I sent them

I point out that Agora does not present itself as a simulation of
psychology, but it does present itself as a simulation of legal
processes.  The use of Black's seems somehow more appropriate than
would the DSM, either 3R or 4. :)

While some aspects of Agora show similarity to legal
processes, I would very much dispute your statement that
it presents itself as a simulation of legal processes.
Where do you believe it does so?

I thought of doing this pretty much as you have it but I decided against it.
One problem with linking the list Order to a change in Status is that if a
Player submits a Proposal when their status is Served they are not moved to
the bottom of the list because their status doesn't change.  I think a
Player should get full credit for every Proposal they make.  That's why I
tied the order to the time of eir last Proposal submission.  As written this
will only discourage Players from Proposing until they are required to
serve.  You will have to add something to change the Service date upon
submission of a Proposal if you agree this is a flaw.

Also, I considered having not special handling for Players on Hold but I
decided against that too.  As written wouldn't it be possible to just go on
hold on the beginning of every week to avoid service?  Thus I thought it
wise to try use a simple test to recognize suspicious behavior (i.e. going
on hold for less than a week when at the top of the list).  If one is
caught, one incurs the obligation immediately, presumably before one can
again go on hold.  If one isn't trying to avoid the penalty the only harm is
that the list is advanced a little quicker.  If this isn't fixed I intend to
write a script to avoid service!  :)

> With many thanks to Macross for the inspiration...

How about a coauthorship on this?  I have yet to be immortalized in the Rule
Set (of course that is ironically enough due to not Proposing!)  :)

Actually, because a Player is a person, the psychology is real, not
simulated.  :-)

Scott's proto is much more than a free voting proto - it's a completely
dismantle the economy proto.

I agree this is a flaw, and I will fix it by making the Promotor list
the "time the Player's Status last changed to Served, or the time the
Player last submitted a Proposal, whichever is latest." Thanks for
picking that up.

The simplest way to fix this would be to adopt, separately, the
amendment to R1016 which was a part of 'A Duty to Vote', but which
failed to have effect due to insufficient Power. This amendment will
make it impossible to go On Hold for less than a week.

The Rules don't officially recognize authorship anymore, which is a
shame in some ways. Wuold you like to submit the Proposal when it's
ready? I don't mind...

I've fixed the bug found by Macross, and clarified a timing issue. This
looks about ready to me. Macross?

####
Proto-Proposal
A Duty to Propose

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "A Duty to Propose", be
created with the following text:

      Every Player has a Public Service Status which takes exactly one
      of the values: Served, or Required to Serve. Initially, every
      Player's Status is Served. The Promotor shall maintain a list of
      all Players, including for each Player eir Public Service Status,
      and the date at which eir Status last changed to Served, or the
      date at which e last submitted a Proposal, whichever is later. The
      list shall be sorted on this date, from earliest to latest, with
      ties being broken alphabetically. The Promotor shall include this
      list in eir Promotor's Report.

      As soon as possible after the beginning of each Week, the Promotor
      shall select the two Active Players not in their Grace Periods
      highest on the list (at the time of selection) who are not already
      Required to Serve, and change their Statuses from Served to
      Required to Serve, by announcing this change in the Public Forum.

      Any Player who is Required to Serve continuously for 14 days has
      their Status changed to Served and commits the Infraction of
      Failure to Propose, incurring a penalty of 1 Blot and 1 P-Note, to
      be detected and reported by the Promotor.

      Whenever any Player submits a Proposal, eir Public Service Status
      changes to (or remains as) Served.

Evidentiary Status of Officer Reports

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1768 be amended to read:

      (a) The published Report of an Officer, with respect to those
          matters reported therein which that Officer is required by
          law to report, shall be afforded the strongest evidentary
          weight.  Evidence of this nature shall be determinative in
          the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the
          contrary.

      (b) No challenge to the published Report of an Officer, with
          respect to those matters reported therein which that Officer
          is required by law to report, shall proceed unless:
          (1) it was been initiated within 21 days of the publication
              of that report; or
          (2) credible evidence that the Officer acted in bad faith,
              or acted in good faith upon information presented to em
              in bad faith, is presented.

Winning

Be it further resolved, that Rule 112 be amended to read:

|     (a) A "potential winner" is any Player for whom, at a given

| 
|     (c) When the Speaker for the first time correctly and completely
|         reports that a potential win has occured, each and every
|         potential winner (at the time of the potential win) then
|         Wins.

Protoproposal Chaos50 [rev. 1]

Some Housecleaning

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 408 be amended to read:

      (a) The Judge of an open CFJ is required to, within seven days of
          when that CFJ last became open or seven days of eir
          assignment to that CFJ, whichever is later, close that CFJ
          by dismissing or judging the CFJ and/or granting or denying
          any outstanding judicial motions pertaining to that CFJ.

      (b) The failure of a Judge to close a case within the prescribed
          time constitutes the Infraction of Judicial Tardiness and
          carries a penalty of one Blot for each day (or fraction
          thereof) that the case remains open beyond the permitted
          time.  This penalty is to be reported by the Clerk of the
          Courts.

      (c) The failure to observe this time limit does not, by itself,
          cause the delinquent Judge to be recused from the CFJ, nor
          does it invalidate eir judgment or dismissal of the CFJ or
          grant or denial of any related judicial motion which that
          Judge might submit after the limit has expired.

      (d) This Rule defers to any other Rule which prescribes a
          different time limit in which a CFJ must be closed, and to
          any other Rule which establishes procedures by which the
          time limit specified in this Rule may be extended or
          shortened.

[This is a slightly modified version of a rule I proposed last
 November, and which was adopted but clobbered by the contemporaneous
 adoption of another Proposal.]

Protoproposal Chaos13 [rev. 4]

No Passing the Buck

Be it therefore resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      (a) A Recordkeepor may elect to reject any Transfer Order or
          Payment Order, the amount of which is not specified by its
          Executor as a fixed numeral.

      (b) The actual numerical value of the amount of a Transfer or
          Payment Order whose amount was not specified by its Executor
          as a fixed numeral is whatever the Recordkeepor, in good
          faith, determines it to be at the time the Order was
          submitted.

      (c) For the purpose of this Rule, a "fixed numeral" is a
          numerical constant specified in a manner that the
          Recordkeepor may determine its value with definite certainty
          without referring to any information in the Game State other
          than the message itself.

[This is to prevent Players from stating that they "execute whatever
 Payment Orders they are required to execute" or "transfer all but two
 VTs to some entity", thereby transferring the responsibility to
 determine what they are legally required to do to Recordkeepors,
 and/or creating uncertainty in Currency Records by specifying
 contingent transfer amounts.]

What have been the most difficult problems for you? You've had computer
trouble recently, I understand. Have you had trouble getting the
spreadsheet to do what you want? I'm no expert on spreadsheets, but my
understanding is that once you get them set up, they should recalculate
totals easily whenever you add new data. Is that not right?

Unfortunately, Scott is not proposing a trial of any sort. If 'Restore
Sanity' is adopted, we will simply have dismantled the economy tout
court. Blob's tweak to the Voting Tariff, currently being voted on,
will allow the Assessor the set the Voting Tariff to zero, which will
create temporary free voting. Personally, I'm not thrilled at the
prospect; it'll just lead to inflation as Salaries continue to pour into
the economy with nothing to spend them on.

Remembering to vote is a precondition to voting whether it's free or
not. As for having the energy to pay: how much energy does it take to
send a message satisfying a voting PO issued by the Assessor?

I don't like this much; it means that no-one can win without the
permission of the Speaker - and nothing requires the Speaker report that
a win has occurred. A Winner would have no legal recourse against a
Speaker who simply refused to report a win.

So anyone who's thinking of voting for it should not do so under the
misapprehension that it's effects will be limited to voting, or that if

Re: The lack of an Accountor's Report.

Can we now do what I suggested several months ago, and reset the VTs 
system to some agreeable state? Things are just getting way out of hand.

Also, what can we do, apart from following Scott's suggestion and nuking
the entire system, to prevent this sort of thing from happening again?
Is there some way we can simplify the Accountor's job?

I'll add a requirement for the Speaker to make a report when it is
made apparent that a win has occured.  Then the failure of the Speaker
to report will be an impeachable offense.

No Retroactivity

Be it therefore resolved, that the following Rule be created with a
Power of 3:

      No action by any Player may have, as a direct or indirect
      consequence, the effect of changing any part of the Game State
      prior to the moment at which that action occured.  Any change
      which the Rules might seek to require to occur at a time prior
      to the time of the Player action of which it is a consequence
      takes place instead at the time of that action.

Winning

| Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 112 have its Power changed to 1.
| 
Be it further resolved, that Rule 112 be amended to read:

      (a) A "potential winner" is any Player for whom, at a given
          time, at least one of the Winning Conditions, and none of
          the Win-Preventing Conditions, then defined by the Rules,
          were satisfied with respect to that Player.

      (b) A "potential win" occurs at any time that there is at least
          one potential winner.

      (c) When the Speaker for the first time correctly and completely
          reports that a potential win has occured, each and every
          potential winner (at the time of the potential win) then
          Wins.

|     (d) A Player who believes the Speaker has failed to report a
|         potential win as described in the preceding subdivision may
|         Call For Judgment on whether the alleged potential win has
|         occured.  If the Judge finds that a potential win has
|         occured and has not been reported, the Judge shall enter an
|         Order compelling the Speaker to make the report.
|

So much for increasing the size of the economy. Sigh. If Blob sets the
Voting Tariff to zero, then I hope the Chancellor will set the BOS to
zero. At least lee won't have any new POs to worry about.

I don't believe the VT system is in a disagreeable state. Of course we
don't know *exactly* what state it is in, but I remain hopeful that this
will soon be remedied. I think that when we do see the Report, we will
see that VT holdings have remained at reasonably sensible levels. 25 VTs
have been spent on voting in the last month, about what has been paid
out in Salaries. (Nevertheless, I'm expecting that taxes will need to be
levied due to other sources of VTs like the passage of IN Proposals and
Judicial salaries.)

This is not the same kind of problem that led us to introduce the
concept of a variable BOS, or taxes, and certainly not the same kind of
problem that required us to adopt one-off measures like 'Restore Game
Balance', which is what you seem to be recommending now.

I've already posted asking lee if he can tell us what has been the most
difficult part of the job. I should extend that query to Crito, who
served as Accountor for so long. Crito? What would you do to make VT
Recordkeeping easier?

I haven't quite rushed out to buy Black's just yet.  What
exactly does "the strongest evidentiary weight" mean?  What
level of evidence would be needed to refute the Officer's report?

What about a word or phrase that has a usual sense *and* a technical
sense?  Say, a word that has one meaning in general usage, but a different,
technical definition listed in, oh, let's say, Black's?

I don't think we can expect to have a working economy as long as we don't
have any real idea what our holdings are. If a month's break is what Lee
needs to get things back in order, then I'd rather leave off the 
economy for a month, and then start it up again with a working accounting
system.

I agree that, to this end, it would be good if the Chancellor could 
also set the BOS to zero. Michael, what do you reckon?

I agree with you that the economy is going moderately well, and I am 
not vying for a restoration of balance. I just think we should set the
economy to some known, and agreed on state. It doesn't have to be a
balanced state. It can be the state represented by the last Accountor's
Report, if you like. 

Of course, I'd rather that we could work out the actual state, and I 
am willing to give Lee a bit of leeway, by turning off the economy 
for a month if necessary, so that we can have the whole thing running
smoothly again thereafter.

Protoproposal Chaos47 [rev. 4]

Winning

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 112 have its Power changed to 1.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 112 be amended to read:

      (a) A "potential winner" is any Player for whom, at a given
          time, at least one of the Winning Conditions, and none of
          the Win-Preventing Conditions, then defined by the Rules,
          were satisfied with respect to that Player.

      (b) A "potential win" occurs at any time that there is at least
          one potential winner.

|     (c) A Speaker's Report of a Win is an announcement by the
|         Speaker stating that one or more Players have won.  Such a
|         report must identify the time at which the Player or Players
|         won, and the Winning Condition(s) satisfied by each such
|         Winner.
| 
|     (d) Upon the announcement of Speaker's Report of a Win, all
|         Players named therein as Winners Win; however, if the
|         Speaker retracts the Report of a Win, all benefits which may
|         have accrued to those Players as a result of having Won are
|         revoked, to the extent that doing so is legal.
| 
|     (e) The Speaker is required to report a Win as soon as possible 
|         after a potential win occurs.
| 
|     (f) If the Speaker reports a Win which does not correspond to a
|         potential win, e is required to retract the report as soon
|         as possible thereafter.
| 
|     (g) Any person who believes the Speaker has violated
|         subdivisions (f) or (g) of this Rule may Call for Judgment
|         alleging that the Speaker has violated the appropriate
|         subdivision.  If the Judge finds that a violation has
|         occured, the Judge shall enter an Order compelling the
|         Speaker to comply with the subdivision in question.
| 
|     (h) Any Speaker who is found by CFJ to have issued a Report of a
|         Win in bad faith shall be Tainted.

I think the second sentence in the proposed subdivision answers your
question rather directly:

>> (a) The published Report of an Officer, with respect to those
>> matters reported therein which that Officer is required by law to
>> report, shall be afforded the strongest evidentary weight.
>> Evidence of this nature shall be determinative in the absence of

(FWIW, "strongest evidentiary weight" does not appear in Black's.  The
only comparable provision in the Federal Rules of Evidence merely
states that the reports of government officials constitute an
exception to the rule of hearsay.  In federal law, there are some
statutory provisions relating to the evidentary weight of certain
documents; for example, the Statutes at Large, as published, are
declared to be conclusive and incontrovertible proof of the law.  This
Proposal stops short of declaring the report of an Officer to be
incontrovertible.)

Agora, for complex historical reasons among others, has an allergy to
automation. Perhaps it is time we asked ourselves if there is any way we
might pursue automation of Recordkeeping without running into the
problems of error that were endemic to Nomic World.

I think you means 'subdivisions (e) or (f)'.

We could just remove the concept of winning from the Ruleset entirely,
you know.

I'm not sure.  I personally am of the belief that conditional actions
are not possible, because I don't buy the "I do things by saying I do
them" axiom, but I understand that others disagree.  I remain open to
suggestions.

This Proposal should also require that specifications be made such
that no knowledge of uncommon non-Agoran-specific information is
required; this Proposal does not appear to address hypotheticals such
as the following:

* "I have written a number on a piece of paper and stuck it in my
  desk drawer.  I hereby transfer that number of VTs to Chuck."

* "I hereby transfer 1 VT to Chuck for each billion grains of sand
  contained within the boundaries of the Indiana Dunes State Park."

* "I hereby transfer either 1 or 2 VTs to Chuck, the number being 1 if
  Gail Riecken wins the election for Representative from Indiana
  Congressional District 8, and 2 if John Hostettler wins that
  election."

(One could also make transfers, the amount of which is the solution to
some intractable mathematical equation; there are even ways to phrase
it so that the quantity is unknowable given the current state of
mathematical theory.  Given that Oerjan exists, this should be deemed
a problem.)
