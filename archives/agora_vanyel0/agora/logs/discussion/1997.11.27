And you would argue that unlike Plato, I do possess VTs in the
ordinary, RL meaning of "possess"?  I think you would be
hard-pressed to defend such a view.

We've been talking about the sensible meaning of "possess" as in "Plato
possesses at least 0.9 VTs."

I agree.

This is another consequence of interpreting words like "deemed" and
"legally deemed" according to thei RL meaning, since the Rules and Game
Custom do not appear to assign them a special, different meaning.

The reason for the popularity of "human interest" stories like this is that
the notion of an animal "owning" things is so contrary to common sense.  In
reality, the legal owner of such property is never an animal, but usually
some legal entity (such as a trust) with a duty to care for the animal.

True, but only by changing the Rules.  If the Rules were changed to allow
others to take your VTs, then I might say that your Rule-based rights of
ownership were then diminished to some extent.

Thanks for a lively debate.  This has certainly helped clarify my own thoughts.

Are you sure he is the first? I do not think that 'being registered as
a Player' was defined in the original Ruleset, so it might well be the case
that at that time people were unregistered Players as well. For that sake,
is Michael a registered Player?

Good point.  I'm sure I'd know if I'd registered myself, and I'm
pretty sure I didn't :-)

Much APPRECIATED.  We look forward to the reign of a CINC dedicated to
maintain our PURITY OF ESSENCE.

Where above do I claim that this is NOT part of an evil PLOT?

EVERYONE KNOWS that the destruction of ozone layer is result of THE
RAMPANT fluorocarbonatization of our DRINKING WATER.

As for the COSMIC RAYS, I am sorry but you DO NOT HAVE sufficient
CLEARANCE FOR this information.

GNAT IS WAY OUT ONE,

The latter is not important - Rule 1730 specifies that it _will_ be
executed, and 1442 cares nothing about the effects, merely that the
execution is successful.

Now, prior to Infection 1598 established a difference between execution
and successful execution.  Without 1598, these terms would collapse into
one, or at least into the common sense definition: the execution is
successful if no other Rule prevents it.  The only Rule which could
prevent this is 1598 itself.


I am not sure whether it is too much of a stretch to claim that a
requirement of execution of a Transfer Order, in the absence of a
definition to the contrary, automatically means that the Transfer occurs,
merely by using common sense definitions.  In that case, the holdings
would be properly adjusted as well.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

Oh, and others have already noted that you need to be more explicit.

I would like some EXPLANATION of both those methods - I do not GENERALLY
eat cereal BOXES, and NSBPS, unlike NSDAP, is a NEW TERM for me.

As some DOUBT has been cast ON THE FAIRNESS of the current SELECTION
methods use for Mutation, I am NATURALLY looking for other APPROPRIATE
methods.

I think that one of the multitudinous versions of what is now Rule 869
acted to register all Players who were Players previous to its

I guess "reject" is clear enough...

This would not work with something like "At the beginning of the next
Nomic Week, I transfer all my VTs to the Nilpotent Group."  I am not sure
whether that is a bug or a feature.

I am still somewhat uncertain whether the conflict with 754 has been
resolved.  We have often allowed phrases that depend on the actual Game
State - in fact, they are vital for handling Game State uncertainties.
If 754 is not what allows them, what then is?

ODE TO THE THERMODYNAMICAL UNIVERSE

Once with a BANG
Thou art outspoken
in time to flow among equals
silently along the stars
slowly withering away
their precious rays.

Verily, even the mighty HOLES,
from whence not escape
light nor man
but a particle weakly appears out of naught.

Slowly, the daze
of highest entropy
by black explosions interrupted

then nothing;
nothing.


THANK YOU,
Ørjan.

Neither of them explains what it means for a Transfer Order be
successfully executed, or what happens when a Transfer Order is
executed.
<<

In the absence of explicit regulations in the rules, coudn't we
return to the "natural" meaning of the words? A transfer order is an
order to transfer currency, and it is (in natural language) quite
clear what that means. Also, every recordkeepor knows how to transfer
currencies - just note the change in your records.

If there is no definition of "successfully executed", you can either
say that no TO is ever successfully executed, or you can turn the
argument around and say that in the absence of a definition of a
failed TO all executions are successful. Kind of like the glass that
is half empty or half full, or the different theological approaches to
using the Bible for ethics ("Whatever is not prohibited explicitly in
the Bible is allowed" vs. "Whateever is not explicitly allowed is
prohibited").

Scott, can you cite game custom in favor of your approach or is it
just the one that suits your style more?

With the transfer orders rule suspended, it appears that even Proposals
3601-3613 cannot be passed.  I quote from Rule 1442:

      A Voting Entity's Votes on a given Proposal are counted for that
      Proposal only if the delayed Transfer Order implicitly submitted
      by Voting on that Proposal is successfully executed at the end
      of the Voting Period of that Proposal.

Could the implicit TO's (for votes already submitted) be successfully
executed today, without Rule 1598?  I don't see how...

In that case, I think that consistency requires us to conclude that
I could not have ceased to be a Player when I ceased to be Speaker,
or Michael should also no longer be a Player by now (that is, if e
wasn't Speaker - but then e should have ceased to be a Player long
before e became Speaker).

This is my position.

On the other hand, any Proposals distributed after the first of
December will be ok, because their VP will end after Rule 1598
disinfects itself.  I encourage the Promotor to delay any future
distributions until a time four days after the date of the Infection
of Rule 1598, to the extent that he can do so legally.

It would be illegal for me to change Currency Records without a
procedure mandated in the Rules; Rule 1011 says so.  The only
Procedure mandate by the Rules that might cause a change in 
Currency Records as a result of a Transfer Order was specified in the
(now suspended) Rule 1598.

This is an interesting point, somewhat orthogonal to the preceding.
However, I think it's goes against commonsense to hold that a Transfer
Order has been executed successfully when the Currency Records to
which it pertains have not been changed, and therefore come to the
conclusion that all Transfer Orders executed during the pendency of
Rule 1598's Infection will categorically fail.

A third, somewhat screwier issue: in my opinion, Players whose Votes
are not counted on a Proposal because the Transfer Orders executed to
pay for their Votes failed are still counted toward Quorum.  Quorum is
based on the number of Players who cast Votes, not the number of
Players whose Votes were counted.  I will indicate the Votes of such
Players on my Voting Reports with an "X", and a fifth number will
appear in the Voting Results indicating the number of disqualified
Voters.  (I could lump them in with Voters who declare Presence, but
that could be somewhat misleading, since many of them did not Declare
Presence.)

Because, as you have reminded me, Plato is definitely *not* a fictituous
entity.  I *don't* buy Morendil's argument that Plato should be treated as a
fictituous entity just because a transfer to him has the same effect on the
game state as if he were.

Not at all.  Rule 1598's Infection doesn't affect the casting of
Votes.  It merely affects their ability to be counted.

That aside, I want my Vote recorded in case I'm wrong about Rule 1598.

As far as I know, there is no such list, and has not been one for
about two years.

A given Player can only spend one P-Note per Proposal on Buybacks.  Wouldn't
any Quorum-lowering conspiracy either be too small to do much, or large enough
to force a scam Proposal to meet normal Quorum and pass?

"Quorum for such a Proposal is zero."  Otherwise this sounds good, as do
the other two.  (I was going to recommend moving duties from the Promotor
to the Assessor, but then saw that you had already done that in the next
versions.)
