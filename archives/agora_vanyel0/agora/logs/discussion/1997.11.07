There's only one way I can see it could have failed, and that is if
more than one Week passed between the enactment of 1743 and Crito's
resigning the Office in my favor. That isn't the case ?

Ah, wait, it is in my CotC-stuff after all, and it's just in the backlog
(my backlog is smaller than it has been, but your CFJ just happens to be
 the oldest thing in it). Expect it very soon.

This must be my fault. Either I missed it, or it is among the CotC-messages
which I have lost, I still don't know in which way. Could you give an
indication of the date that you made it?

Why would that matter?  There can't be any new PI Infractions until Dec. 1.

Rule 1743 requires the Herald's actions to take place ASAP after its 
enactment. I'm not sure whether failure to observe this requirement 
would prevent the rest of the Rule from taking effect. (And I'm too 
lazy to check).

One remark pending full review of the content - it is my opinion
that the above statement is equivalent to actually submitting your
Judgement to the CotC as such, which is not, I gather, what you
intended.

Rule 591/10 (Power=1)
Legal Judgements

      A Judge returns a Judgement by sending it to the Clerk of the
      Courts.  (...)

While I'm not particularly happy with the outcome of such a judgement
in this particular case, having read the judge's arguments I do admit
that 1339 is quite clear and the ambiguity found by Chuck is not only
a matter of eir personal taste or of game custom. So I guess I'd
accept that judgement, thank Scott for the careful outline of eir
reasoning and wait to see whether Andre's amendment gets through and
is an acceptable solution to the problem.

Well, he didn't send a judgement to the CotC; he sent an 'intended 
judgement.'

Failure to perform duties ASAP does not deprive the actions performed

Re: 1743

Rule 1743/0 (Power=1)
Blot Amnesty

      Upon the creation of this Rule, the Herald shall report, as soon
      as possible, all Infractions of Persistent Indebtedness that
      have been committed and not previously reported.  When e has
      done so, e is then authorised and obliged to, as soon as
      possible, vacate all unsatisifed Payment Orders for Indulgences.
      Immediately after e has done so, this Rule repeals itself.


Just to set minds at ease, the report of Infractions was completed within a
week of the passage of this Rule.  Even the COE was admitted and corrected
within the week timeframe (November 5).  The vacation of outstanding POs was
due within a week of the report (not a week from the passage).  This was
completed on November 7, well within the week required.

It's easier to give you that kind of information in terms of
word legnth--

Here's an overview;

Summary of the Object Proto's effect on the ruleset:

The Proto impacts 41 existing Rules;

9 Rules are amended in a minor fashion. (Essentially changing obsolete 
terminology)

15 Rules are repealed

17 Rules are amended in a substantial fashion.

In addition, a total of 11 Rules are created.


Not counting the minor changes;

The part of the Ruleset this affects is about 4700 words long. It is replaced
by about 3500 words of text. (21.5K down to 16.5K-- shaving 
about 2% off the legnth of the Ruleset Im working off of.)

I declare Presence on the INP 350 Referendum.  (Note that this is
effective despite only having been sent to agora-discussion, because I
am the Assessor.)

I would contest that conclusion.

I think so. Note that there is a Proposal outstanding that deals with
this very situation.

I might also note that you might consider that those transfer were not
actually made because they were contigent on their being made to
satisfy those particular Payment Orders.

Andre:

This was originally issued as CFJ 1051.  Which is the correct number?

I have never in my whole tenure with the Game seen such a string of
misnumbered CFJs.  Is there any chance that things will change if the
present CotC is re-elected?

Regards,
