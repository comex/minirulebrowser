Harvel was also eligible, yes? It doesn't matter in this case - you're
free to choose whomever you like - but you should remember to include
him next time.

I think that this still requires a Power = 3 Rule to be effective, and
that is a deal-breaker for me. I will support only SA mechanisms that
can operate at Power = 1. Your suggestion of a few weeks ago fits the
bill: allow a Proposer to declare Without Objection that a Proposal is
Trivial (personal preference: at a cost equivalent to the Voting Cost in
VTs, and the height of the Priority Bar in P-Notes). A Trivial Proposal has
a Voting Cost of 0 VTs, and is distributed in addition to whatever other
Proposals are distributed that week.

I will restict myself to offering to Judge Crito the obvious
counter-argument for his consideration, which is simply this: that the
message I sent to the PF does contain a clear indication that "An Object
Lesson" is intended to become a Proposal, namely the text the first
sentence of the paragraph quoted by Blob. Had anybody read the message
in full and noticed the paragraph in question, it would have been clear
to them that "An Object Lesson" was intended to become a Proposal. Hence
the message satisfies the requirements of R1483. R1483 does not require
that such clear indications as are present be noticed by the other
Players.

On the other hand, if an indication is not clear enough to be noticed
by a dozen Players, then this suggests to me that it is not very
clear, regardless of how it happens to be worded.  I think there is a
strong case for arguing that clarity is a function of more than just
content, but also of presentation.

What you're saying is that burying any Proposal in another message is
impossible: if it's a buried well enough not to be found, then ipso
facto there was insufficient clarity in the indication that it was a
Proposal. But then: what if someone *had* noticed "An Object Lesson"
buried in the spam? That was certainly not impossible. Indeed, given my
repeated warnings on the subject, and Oerjan's well-known reactions to
spamming, I more-than-half expected it. Surely in that case, "An Object
Lesson" would have been recognized as a Proposal, for the very reason
that the message clearly indicates that it is intended to become a
Proposal.

Something like that I guess.

In that case, there would have been much less evidence for the claim
that there wasn't a clear indication.  My argument is just that
assessing whether or not something is a clear indication can be done
(at least in part) by checking to see whether the appropriate audience
felt that they had had something indicated to them.  Surely the
failure of a dozen people to notice the Proposal is a good sign that
the indication is not clear?

I don't mean to assert an equivalence (that failure to notice proves
lack of clarity), only to point out supporting evidence for the view
that the proposal text wasn't properly accompanied by a clear
indication.

Suppose I print the entire text of War and Peace on a poster (it's a large
poster), while including the above paragraph Steve buried in his message.
There would be a clear indication to anyone who read the whole poster, but
the method of presentation makes it unclear. Thus, presentation _can_ affect
clarity.

I'm not certain whether the fact that a message *contains* a clear 
indication, etc. is sufficient in regard to R1483. To help 
illustrate, simply imagine some Agora-business post rambling on 
peripheral observations - such as "Look, Repeal 1483, it's useless".  

In fact, consider *this* very message - and in particular the 
beginning of my second sentence, which is an acrostich for "This is a 
Proposal"; I would be prepared to argue that it, too, 'contains' a 
clear indication that "Repeal 1483, it's useless" was intended to 
become a Proposal. However, R1483 does not use the word 'contain', 
but rather states "deliver some collection of text [...] *with* the 
clear indication", etc. which I would argue supports Michael's 
argument that the context is as important as the content.

Sigh.  Could someone please send me a copy of the entire posting, with headers?

My mind's not made up on the matter, but I'm not convinced that the Rules support
Blob's (et al.) argument.  The Rules say the text has to be sent to the PF "with
the clear indication...".  It is as if the text, including the "clear indication", were posted
on a bulletin board and we were asked to look at them through a door with a frosted
glass window.  Certainly we do not perceive the indication clearly, nevertheless the
text *is* accompanied by a "clear indication".  I need to hear better arguments to
convince me that the word "clear" in the above Rule applies to our perception of
the indication rather than to just the indication itself.

Of course, there may be other reasons for judging this statement TRUE and the full
text with headers may help me determine this.

Thanks,
Crito

Clever.  8)  I, however, would not be prepared to argue or to
accept the idea that an acrostich was a *clear* indication of
anything.

I don't think the distinction between "contain" and "with"
particularly supports the context argument.  "Contain" would mean
the indication must be within the collection of text itself, but since
the "collection of text" in the Rule refers to the Proposal text itself,
"contain" is not appropriate.  The clear indication must be presented
along *with* the Proposal text.  It still leaves us to sort out whether
that clarity applies to the text of the indication alone or to our ability
to perceive that text, as well.

I admit I am not sure myself in this particular case.

Of course. That's how I would have done it. I would have sent it to one of
the backup lists as well, to try to avoid the "BUS:" prefix on the Subject
header.

Alas.

Also, it seems to me that if it were not clearly a Proposal there would in
fact be no controversy at all.

Ahh...  yes, I think you are correct that this new idea would require Power
= 3.  After reflecting on this awhile I think I agree with you that such a
powerful, and potentially scammable, mechanism should be Power = 1 if
possible.  This will make it easier to either repeal or modify the mechanism
if the need should arise.
