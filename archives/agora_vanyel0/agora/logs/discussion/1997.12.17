      purpose for doing so, or if e specifies a purpose for doing so,
      but the transfer fails to accomplish that purpose, the Bank
      shall, as soon as possible, transfer that Currency back to that
      entity.

Fix Indulgence Distribution

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1712 be amended to read:

      At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Herald shall randomly
      distribute a number of Indulgences equal to the number of Blots
      executed in the past Week, less the number of Blots vacated in
      the past Week, among all Players: for each such Indulgence, the
      Herald shall randomly select one Player and issue a Payment
      Order from the Bank to that Player for one Indulgence.  If this
      number is negative, no distribution occurs.

Innocent Error Defense

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1575 be amended, by appending a
paragraph reading 

      Furthermore, it is a defense to any accusation of a Crime that
      the Player reasonably believed that eir actions were not a
      Crime at the time e performed them, or that e reasonably did not
      know that e was required to perform an action, when such
      nonperformance is defined as a Crime.  No Player shall be
      convicted of a Crime if this defense applies.

Not that INP356 does such a thing.

Erm, it doesn't?? It contains three transmutations, one amendment and
one repeal, concerning two different rules. And IN 106 defines

    A rule change is the enactment, repeal, or amendment of a mutable
    rule, or the transmutation of an immutable rule into a mutable rule or
    vice versa. 

Not that it matters very much, but I was a bit confused by Chuck's
remark.

>I hereby do whatever is necessary to become a Contestant of "Chain Letter 1".

This is in itself a request to join, in accordance with Reg. 2 (see below).
However, I doubt Michael will accept this as a Transfer Order of 1 VT to
the Contest, so you're not a Contestant yet.

Regards,
-- elJefe, Contestmaster

===================================================================
Regulations:

1)  The initial Contestmaster is elJefe. The Contestmaster may appoint any
other Player to become Contestmaster in eir place, if that player has
agreed to do so.

2)  Until there is a Winner, any Player who has not been a Contestant
before may become a contestant upon eir request and the payment of 1 VT to
the Contest Fund.  No other player may become a Contestant, nor may anyone
become or remain a Contestant after there is a Winner.

3)  Each Contestant, as soon as possible after becoming a Contestant, shall
designate two other Players as that Contestant's nominees.  No two
contestants shall designate the same Player as a nominee.

4)  Whenever both of a contestant's nominees become Contestants, the
Contestmaster shall pay that contestant 2 VTs from the Contest Fund.

5)  One week after any player becomes a Contestant, if no other Player has
since become a Contestant, that Player is the Winner and shall receive all
VTs remaining in the Contest Fund.  At that point all Contestants cease to
be Contestants.

6)  The Contest shall terminate when there is a Winner and all payments
required by the Regulations have been made.

It creates one Rule, which in turn does all those things.

Right. This would cost you a Kudo if there was someone else that deserved it.

Jeffrey> Um, quite wrong.  Read it again, Wizard.

Oh?

Proposal 3645 (elJefe)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Late Judgements

Amend Rule 408 to read:
 
      [...]

      A Judge who has neither judged nor dismissed a CFJ within seven
      days after the end of the assigned deliberation period becomes
      ineligible to Judge that CFJ, and any Judgement or Dismissal
      submitted after this time is not legal and shall not be accepted
      by the CotC.

      However, if the Player assigned to Judge a CFJ ceases to be
      eligible before judging or dismissing that CFJ, then e is neither
      required nor permitted to either return a Judgement on, or
      dismiss, that CFJ, and ceases to be the Judge assigned to that CFJ
      at the moment e becomes ineligible.

Seems like it to me that if you let seven days pass, you _are_
ineligible, and you _may not_ return Judgement.  Period, end of
sentence.  

It does turn out that I am not entirely correct; your proposed Rule
408 is internally inconsistent, which is a worse sin than what I
originally accused you of.  In fact, I should have docked you 3 Style
Points instead of 2.  The Proposed Rule 408 states that a late
Judgement is both legal (second paragraph) and not legal (third
paragraph), which is absurd.  This is a seriously flawed Proposal, and
should not be allowed to pass.

I hesitate to intervene here, but is it possible, Scott, that you have
misread the first paragraph of the Proposal? It does say "within seven
days after the end of the *assigned deliberation period*...", not
"within seven days of being assigned...".

So if you let 7 days pass, you have another seven days before becoming
ineligible. Or so I read it. Am I mistaken?

To be honest, I am no longer sure.  I am convinced that this Proposed
RUle is unnecessarily confusing, however.
