A question,
though: I ran a search for the word "terminal" in the SLR and came up
with two matches, both in rule 1739 (neither defines it).  Is it
defined somewhere else? 
<<

As far as I'm aware that is one of the bugs in the current probate
system, and the "boring" plans submitted and executed so far have all
simply skipped the steps intended for terminal estates, saying that
the estates in question were not terminal.

Hmm.  I'm not sure about this either.  But I think it doesn't work.  Quote from
Rule 1757.

      The Trustee may exercise the above powers only when implementing
      a Plan for the disposition of the Estate of the entity in
      Probate of which e is the Trustee.

      The Trustee of an entity in Probate ceases to be Trustee when:
        a) e announces in the Public Forum that e resigns as Trustee;
        b) e ceases to be a Player;
        c) the entity of which e is Trustee ceases to be in Probate;
           or
        d) the Notary announces that e has been removed as Trustee.

      An entity in Probate ceases to be in Probate when its Trustee
      announces the completion the implementation of a Plan for the
      disposition of the Estate of that entity.

You did already announce the completion of the implemention.  The above text
does not require, AFAICT, that the announcement be correct.  IMO, Morendil
ceased to be in Probate at that point and so you may now no longer exercise the
powers of Probate.

Yes, this is the same thing I was thinking after re-reading the code.  As a
matter of fact, unless someone else comes up with a good reason why this is
incorrect, I will go ahead and complete the vacation of these satisfied POs
later this week.

Morendil's implementation seems to have highlighted most, if not all, of the
major flaws in the current probate system.  8)

Ah, don't forget Time Agent's "creative" manipulation. I have looked
long and hard but cannot as yet find a good reason why e should not
be within eir rights in constructing a Plan that transfers to
Players other than creditors.

Proto-Proposal
Block successive Revolts

[Comment: at present, nothing prevents two Revolts happening one right
after the other. Given that only 1/3 of Players are needed for a Revolt,
I think that newly elected Officers should be given a secure period
of a few weeks in which they need not fear another Revolt. This is also
fairer on the Registrar, who has to conduct all those Elections.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 1664 (Rebellion) be amended by 
replacing the text in it which currently reads:

      If at any time at least 1/3 of all Players are Rebellious a
      Revolt occurs.

with text which reads:

      If at any time at least 1/3 of all Players are Rebellious, and
      at least one month has passed since the last Revolt, a Revolt
      occurs.

It is my opinion that this will, if adopted, reverse our current
practice of interpreting R1023 such that actions performed late
are still effective. 

R1023 allows that:

      This Rule does not deprive actions which do not conform to its
      requirements of whatever effects they would otherwise have. 
      Rather, this Rule defines the latest time at which actions to
      be performed "as soon as possible" may be performed without
      incurring a Penalty.

At present, we have some latitude to interpret the effects an
action 'would otherwise have', and we have been using that latitude
to give late actions effectiveness. But I think this proto will
remove that latitude by answering the question: 'what effects would
this action otherwise have?' with the answer 'none'. Is this what you
intend?

I like this, but I think that the ASAP rule might need some revision
to bring it into line (and make it comprehensible!)
