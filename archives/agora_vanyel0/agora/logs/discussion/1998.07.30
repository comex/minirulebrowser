Not at all.  If you disagree with the CotC's selection, allege that
the assigning order is improper.  The appeal would be eligible to be
filed with the Justiciar (per Rule 1831/0) so the CotC can't prevent
review.

But that's not what Blob suggested. In the situation as you describe it,
there are some circumstances in which a Judge, once selected, does not
remain selected if we discover at a later date that e was selected
improperly. I have no objection to pragmatizing Judge selection,
provided that it is done in such a way that abuse is prevented, and
uncertainty minimized.

Reading that back, perhaps I misunderstood you. My objection to Blob's
scheme was not that the CotC might refuse to distribute a CFJ accusing
em of violating a Rule, but that the violation of the Rule, once
accomplished, would simply be a fait accompli. Under Blob's scheme, even
if a Judge found that the CotC had acted improperly, there'd be no
recourse other than punishing the CotC, ie no way actually to ensure
that Judge selection was done properly. Although I suppose that if the
punishment were severe, this might strongly discourage the CotC from
doing anything untoward.

I think this is adequate.  We're happy enough to take this line with
necessarily unretractable errors/crimes such as electioneering.
Wilful criminal behaviour has yet to prove itself a problem in Agora,
and though I don't think we should ignore the possibility, I don't
think we need to lose too much sleep over it.

You're right.  I misread the rule.  It starts out talking about rule
violation CFJs and Crime CFJs but the last paragraph only talks about
Crime CFJs.  This is despite the fact the rule violations not classed
as Crimes actually still attract both Formal Apology and Blot
penalties (the latter from R1439).

I further apologise if my last post made me sound like a scofflaw.

First of all I apologize for my long silence - I was away to two
conferences and didn't get eMail access in Paris as I had hoped.

Now, here are my 2 cents (Euro or US$, your choice).

Cent 1 is more a question: is it even possible to retroactively change
judge assignments that are the result of intentionally or
unintentionally wrong assignment procedures, given that 951 says

      Once assigned as the Judge of a CFJ, that Player remains the
      Judge of that CFJ until e is recused from that CFJ, or e ceases
      to be a Player.

Or would you argue that a procedurally wrong assignment is not a real 
assignment at all? 

Cent 2 concerns the background of my judgement. I made it very
quickly, and based on what I've been thinking about the matter
before. As I mentioned in the judgement I have always found it rather
clear that the letter of the rule only allows avoiding CFJs that have
already been made and can be identified by a number or some such
thing. 

At the same time, the more liberal practice used by, at least, the two
last CotCs, was happily accepted by the Agora community and never
challenged.  Now I know what I'm saying now is not backed up by any
rules (and it is this situation, where legal and procedural practice
deviates from the letter of the law, unchallenged, that interests me),
but I think this general acceptance of the practice for a considerable
period of time should be reason enough to let the past assignments,
including those of CFJ1010 and 1011, stand. On the other hand, it is
not enough, IMO, to allow me as a judge to base my judgement more on
this generally accepted practice than on what I consider the letter of
the law.

So my idea was this: For a considerable time we didn't follow the
letter of the law in this respect; this practice was validated by the
fact that, although the deviation was obvious to everyone, noone ever
complained. Now it _has_ been challenged, and the challenge accepted
by a judge, so our practice should revert (now, not retroactively) to
the letter of the law (and if we want to go back to the more liberal
practice, we should do so by changing the rule, not by appealing the
judgement). 

I would not argue like this if the deviation from the law was either
new and so far undiscovered; or if it would have caused considerable
damage and/or conflict due to abuse based on the illegal practice. 

I know that all this is not based on interpretations of individual
rules; that is what makes the case interesting to me. I'm looking
forward to your opinions (I hope I have, at least implicitly, answered
most of the iportant points made by others in the discussion so far).

Even though I am inclined to agree with Kolja's judgement, the debate about
this is interesting and serious enough to warrant a thourough review, IMO.  So
I also call the appeal of CFJ 1101.

Re: CFJ1101

A little more justification for my appeal call.

Making Oneself Ineligible To Judge a CFJ

      A Player makes emself ineligible to be the Judge of a specific
      CFJ by transmitting a notice to the Clerk of the Courts,
      specifying the CFJ for which e wishes to be made ineligible.

I agree with Steve's assertion (to paraphrase) that saying "all CFJs made in
the next week" is no more a reference to a specific CFJ than "all the Players
whose nicknames start with 'M'" is a reference to a specific Player.

However, the wording in R1101 is ambiguous wrt the notice requirements.  "All
CFJs made in the next week", if effective, *does* make a Player ineligible to
judge specific CFJs.  OTOH, it seems natural to assume that "specifying the
CFJ" refers to the "specific CFJ" mentioned in the first clause - an
interpretation supported by the use of the singular in the final clause.

Still, it is not clear to me that the more liberal interpretation is truly
prohibited by the "letter" of this Rule, so that past practices may be relevant
and an appeal is warranted.

The CFJ alleging the assignment to be invalid could easily be
accompanied by a motion requesting that the order of assignment be
vacated; I would consider such an motion reasonable.  I'd have to
check the Rules to see whether such an order would be legal, but I
tend to think it would be, if issued by Judge in response to an
properly-made motion.

I don't feel strongly one way or the other, but if we're setting

Then allow a CFJ to be called alleging that the Clerk of the Court abused
his authority.  Of course in such a CFJ the Speaker would act in place of
the Clerk.

What's to stop us from empowering the Judge to Order that the original
Judgement be thrown out and the CFJ be reconsidered?

Whenever this has happened to me it was an issue with an extra period
in the actual DNS entry.  You know when you put a domain entry in some
DNS' they append the main host name again unless you put a period at
the end. It might have 2 periods accidentally.


Also, i had a problem once like this where my ISP said the site had no
reverse lookup record for that entry.  I'm new to this so this may just
be bulls*** from the ISP.

Yes, after I sent the message it occurred to me that there was already a
mechanism in place to handle such matters.

You may want to make sure there were no relevant Rule changes between that
time (which I believe is the time I began my Counter-revolution) and the
time at which Swann is alleged to have committed the crime.  My records
indicate only that there was a Voting report indicating the passage of P3747
"The Levers of Monetary Policy", but my records are a bit sketchy around
that time.

I noticed on Chuck's Nomic page the following claim:

	 Agora itself was started following the collapse of another
	 nomic, Nomic World, which remains the only known MUD-based
	 nomic. 

This claim is untrue. Shattered World, the MUD on which Geoff Wong (the
other co-founder of Nomic World) is a Wizard, has had a Nomic as part of
its structure for some time. It is one of the most interesting Nomics
currently in existence, because it exists within the confines of a very
rich and elaborate virtual world, with its own politics and objects. Its
amendments are thus less focussed on procedural rules than, say, Agora's
are, and more on legislating various aspects of Player interaction with
the environment (for example, laws against public drunkenness, whatever
that might amount to in Shattered World.) According to Geoff, Shattered
World Nomic has between 10 and 15 active Players, which is quite
respectable for a Nomic. Apparently it evolves quite slowly, going
through periods of relative dormancy punctuated by periods of intense
activity. They are currently enjoying a period of intense activity, as
one of the Players, (the owner of Shattered World's Casino) has captured
the King in a legal trap that was laid for him, sparking a complex
political confrontation.

Does this mean that you no longer need me to supply you with the May 21

Pragmatists and platonists will probably divide on the question. One
thing for sure is that we are not consistent on the matter. Michael,
for example, treated his initial assignment of CFJ 1100 (when he had
Macross mistakenly down as ineligible) as though his procedurally
incorrect assignment was not a real assignment; yet he argues that for
CFJs prior to CFJ 1100, those procedurally wrong assignements are
nevertheless real assignments - and who would disagree with him?

Well, that certainly would be convenient, but Agorans have some history
at least of eschewing convenience for adherence to the law. The idea
that the general acceptance of a practice contrary to law is reason
enough to allow the instances of the practice to stand was certainly
rejected by the Judges of CFJ 737, for example, with the result that
several months of Kudo transfers were tossed out as invalid. On the
other hand, there are plenty of occasions on which convenience has been
the victor over strict adherence.

Why do you think the deviation was 'obvious to everyone'? It certainly
wasn't obvious to me. I've never looked closely enough at R1567 to have
noticed this problem.
