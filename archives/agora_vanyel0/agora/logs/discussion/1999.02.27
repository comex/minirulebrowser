We should never have switched to monthly Salaries in the first place; it
was a silly over-reaction to lee's troubles as Accountor.

Of course, when the good General says that we need to fix Salaries, one
suspects that he probably means that we need to get rid of Currencies.

Protoproposal Chaos74 [rev. 4]

Broaden Actions Without Objection

Be it resolved, that Rule 1728 be amended to read:

      (a) When the Rules specify that an action may be performed
          "Without N Objections", where N is an integer between one
          and five inclusive, that action may be legally performed
          under the following conditions:
        (1) The Player who seeks to perform the action has announced
            eir intent to perform that action not fewer than four days
            before, nor more than fourteen days before, the
            performance of the action, and this announcement must
            unambiguously describe the action to be performed;
        (2) The action performed must match exactly the action
            described in the announcement made under subdivision
            (a)(1) of this Rule;
        (3) The Rule which authorizes the performance of that action
            Without N Objections must explicitly state which Player or
            Players are authorized to perform that action; and
        (4) During the time between the announcement made under
            subdivision (a)(1) of this Rule and the performance of the
            action itself, fewer than N Players have posted, in the
            Public Forum, Objections to the performance of that
            action.

      (b) If the action to be performed is the change of some property
          under that Player's control, the change may not take place
          until the Player announces that e is making that change. 
          (This requirement is met by making any announcement normally
          required by the Rules in order to make such changes.)

      (c) The specification in the Rules that an action may be
          performed "Without Objection" is equivalent to specifying
          that it may be performed "Without 1 Objection".

      (d) The specification in the Rules that an action may be
          performed "Without N Objections" in no way prohibits
          performing that same action if doing so would be otherwise
          permissible.

      (e) A Rule may specify further restrictions upon the performance
          of an action Without N Objections, and this Rule defers to
          such Rules.

Protoproposal Chaos50 [rev. 4]

Some Housecleaning

Be it resolved, that Rule 408 be amended to read:

      (a) The Judge of an open CFJ is required to, within seven days
          of when that CFJ last became open or seven days of eir
          assignment to that CFJ, whichever is later, close that CFJ
          by dismissing or judging the CFJ and/or granting or denying
          any outstanding judicial motions pertaining to that CFJ.

      (b) The failure of a Judge to close a case within the prescribed
          time constitutes the Infraction of Judicial Tardiness and
          carries a penalty of one Blot for each day (or fraction
          thereof) that the case remains open beyond the permitted
          time.  This penalty is to be reported by the Clerk of the
          Courts.

      (c) The failure to observe this time limit does not, by itself,
          cause the delinquent Judge to be recused from the CFJ, nor
          does it invalidate eir judgment or dismissal of the CFJ or
          grant or denial of any related judicial motion which that
          Judge might submit after the limit has expired.

      (d) This Rule defers to any other Rule which prescribes a
          different time limit in which a CFJ must be closed, and to
          any other Rule which establishes procedures by which the
          time limit specified in this Rule may be extended or
          shortened.

How about a requirement that any Proposal Adopted Without Objection is 
considered Disinterested, instead?  That way the Proposer isn't forced 
to choose in advance.  (Besides, if you do force Proposers to choose
in advance, one merely need Propose the same Proposal twice, once as
Interested, once as Disinterested.  So there's no merit in forcing
them to choose.)

Cleanup of R.1006

Be it resolved, that Rule 1006 be amended to read:

      (a) An Office is any position established by the Rules as such.

      (b) At any time, a given Office is held by exactly one Player. 
          If an Office would otherwise not be held by any Player, it
          shall be held by the Speaker.

      (c) An Officer is any Player who holds an Office.

      (d) A given Office has whatever duties, responsibilities, and
          privileges that the Rules assign to it.

[Most of the rest of the current R.1006 is superfluous baggage.]

Protoproposal: Trivial Amendments

Create a new rule to read:

A proposal shall be considered trivial if none of its effects do not
meet any of the following criteria:

i. A misspelled word is corrected.

ii. A grammatical error is corrected.

iii. A rule is reformatted, which is defined as a change in the way it
is displayed that does not affect its content.

iv. A rule is reorganized, which is defined as a change in the way any
parts of a rule are numbered such that there is no difference in the
application of a rule. [for example, a proposal could renumber these
criteria as ii, i, v, iv, and iii]

v. No effect occurs.

A trivial proposal shall be considered a disinterested proposal.

Could we get rid of the double negative?  It's easier to understand
if you say "if all of its effects are of the following types" or
something like that.

I'd leave out the example--we rarely put examples in rules.  And if
you do leave it in, use parentheses instead of brackets.  Brackets
are usually reserved for comments in a proposal which have no effect.

>
>v. No effect occurs.

Unnecessary, I think, since you say "its effects" above.

Would that leave those with Power of Attorney in limbo? How about adding
a sentence revoking all Powers of Attorney?

I don't think it is necessary, as Rule 1478 states:

      Except when the Rules stipulate otherwise, a Player is eir own
      Executor.

Unnecessary; the repeal of the Rule authorizing Powers of Attorney
would necessarily cause all existing Powers of Attorney to cease to
exist (see Rule 1586), and all Players then subject to Power of
Attorney would immediately again become their own Executors (see Rule
1478).

I note that any ties in the List of Active Players to be drawn up by
the Scorekeepor under Rule 1875 must be broken by random selection,
and that such selection must be made by the Speaker.  Scorekeepor Vlad
may not make random selections for this purpose.  See Rule 1079.

No, someone needs to make them.  The Rule doesn't say that YOU do, and 
Rule 1079 says the Speaker does.

Protoproposal Chaos78 [rev. 4]

Summary Adoption

Be it resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 3, to read:

      (a) The Proposer of any Proposal may cause it to be Adopted
          Without Objection, but only if the Proposal has not yet been
          distributed.

      (b) A Proposal Adopted Without Objection is Adopted at the time
          its Proposer changes its status to Adopted in accordance
          with the procedure for performing changes Without Objection,
          but only if at that time that Proposal has not yet been
          distributed.

      (c) When a Proposal is Adopted Without Objection, it is removed
          from the Queue.

|     (d) A Proposal Adopted Without Objection is considered to be
|         Disinterested.
| 
|     (e) This Rule takes precedence over:
|       (1) any Rule which would prevent a Proposal from being Adopted
|           Without Objection;
|       (2) any Rule which would prevent a Proposal Adopted Without
|           Objection from being removed from the Proposal Queue; and
|       (3) any Rule which would prevent a Proposal Adopted Without
|           Objection from being considered Disinterested.

May I say that this continuous repetition of proposals does get rather
annoying from time to time. Especially when they are the same protos that
have already been seen a zillion times before - or, when there are 
revisions, there is no explanation accompanying them as to what has
been changed, or why.

I really don't see the use in reposting them all the time. If I didn't
comment on the proto the first time, I am unlikely to care on the fourth
or fifth time either.

There are also a number of interesting precedence conflicts within the
various Tournament Rules; for example, Rule 1875 requires that the
Circles be seeded according to the scores of the preceding Round,
which clearly conflicts with the requirement in Rule 1876 that a
Player who opts not to participate in a Round shall be seeded with eir
Score in the Round preceding.

In Rule 1876, the Scorekeepor is required to "instruct" the Accountor
to pay out VTs to the members of a Team in certain circumstances, and
the Accountor is required to then do so.  Why?  Why not have the
Scorekeepor pay them out instead?  Why this extra level of
indirection?

As I read Rule 1877, every Team is immediately dissolved upon
creation: it is a condition for the continued existence of a Team that
none of its Players belong to an existing Team.

I have it set to send out not more than 1 Proposal a day nor more than
3 per week, and not more than 3 protos a day nor more than 15 per
week.  Protos will not be redistributed unless they have been changed,
or they haven't been protoed within seven days and have not yet been
proposed (this is actually a holdover from the days when
protoproposing was required to earn the protoproposal bonus; I should
lengthen this), or if they have been proposed but it has been more
than 21 days (which I should also change because the Proposal Queue
now means that I can't rely on a Proposal passing or failing within 21
days).  It takes sixty days before I repropose a proposal.  There are
other controls as well.  I've been experimenting with settings here to
try to find something that gets protos and proposals through in decent
time without flooding the discussion forum and Proposal Queue with
them.

I've changed the reproto time to 15 days and the reproto after
proposal time to 30 days.

I currently have 43 protos in some state of development; keeping track 
of all of these by hand would be difficult.  I've been using this
script for a very long time. 

Of course, one good way to make a proto go away is to vote FOR it when
they come up for vote.  I do remove protos from the system when a
Rulekeepor's Memo comes down that indicates a Rule Change that
conflicts with a provision in one of my protos.  (I have a script that
assists with this, although it is not yet automatic.)  So if you vote
in one of my Proposals, the associated proto will go away when it gets 
implemented. :)
