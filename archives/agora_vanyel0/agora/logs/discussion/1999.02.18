Agreed.  I think the most robust solution would be to add a clause like this
to Rules 1482 and 1030:  "Any attempt to create or amend a rule so that it
resolves such conflicts in a different way shall be without effect, Rules to
the contrary notwithstanding."  Then upmutate 1030 to Power=3.

Why that Rule? It doesn't really do anything, since there is no
possible penalty for Proposing. But I don't expect it to ever be
distributed. I just wanted to set a record.

No, just a random sequence of keystrokes. I thought about including
a significant number, like the first two phone numbers in the
Vladivostok telephone directory, but decided that was putting too much
effort into it. Just playing around with the Rules.

Wouldn't that make it very difficult to amend 1030 and 1482 as well?
The protection clause would apply to themselves.

R1030 is now a Power=3 Rule, although it wasn't when this discussion
originally took place.

This argument doesn't quite work. R1873 requires that Kolja have
effective control of his assets *at the time the batch of Proposals is
distributed*. It is true that Kolja could have withdrawn his Power of
Attorney, but it is equally true that in fact he did not. Hence, as it
happens, at the time the Proposals were distributed, he did not have
effective control of those assets. The fact that he could later revoke
my control is irrelevant.

Proto:  Registrar's Report tweaks

Amend Rule 1042 (Deregistration Due to Silence) by replacing this paragraph:

      The Registrar shall include in eir Report the most recent
      date on which each Player changed from being Noisy, Quiet or
      Silent to any of the others.

with this paragraph:

      The Registrar shall maintain a list of each Player's status (Noisy,
      Quiet, or Silent) and the most recent date on which each Player's
      status changed.  This list is known as the Blue-in-the-Face Pages,
      and is part of the Registrar's Report.

Amend Rule 1367 (Degrees) by replacing this paragraph:

      The Registrar shall note in eir report which persons possess
      which Degrees.

with this paragraph:

      The Registrar shall maintain a list of which persons possess which
      Degrees.  This list is known as the Gray Pages, and is part of the
      Registrar's Report.

This argument does not work. R1873 measures effective control of an
asset at a particular time, namely the time a batch of Proposals is
distributed. What the Grantor of a Power of Attorney does with eir grant
after that that time is irrelevant to R1873. Equally irrelevant is the
fact that the Grantor could have, but did not, withdraw the Power of
Attorney. Of relevance is only the actual state of affairs when a
Proposal is distributed.

At the time the batch was distributed, he could also have withdrawn his
Power of Attorney. And have done whatever he wanted with those assets in
the same message.

And the actual state of affairs is that he can withdraw the Power of
Attorney. In my opinion, if a series of actions, fully under a player's
control, brings something under that player's control immediately, then
it is effectively under that player's control already.

Well quite.  Somehow Steve wants us to distinguish between the
following two sorts of control of a Currency asset:

Kolja posts to the PF: 
  "I hereby transfer 2 VTs to the Bank to satisfy PO xyz"

If Kolja could do this, and have the Recordkeepor be required to obey
the instruction, then presumably Steve would concede that he had
effective control.

However, Steve doesn't think that Kolja being able to write to the PF:
  "I hereby withdraw my Power of Attorney from Steve. 
   I hereby transfer 2 VTs to the Bank to satisfy PO xyz"
constitutes "effective control".

At any given moment in time, including that moment when Assessor Blob
made his determination of "effective control of 3 or more VTs", Kolja
could equally well have posted the second message as the first.  The
second message would have resulted in the transfer of funds according
to Kolja's wishes.  Sounds like "effective control" to me. 

Michael.

That is correct, but insufficient as a refutation. That Rule states
"Effective control of an asset [...] is the ability to dispose of
that asset as one wishes." In the case of Currencies, the only choice
one has regarding their disposition is whether to keep them or
transfer them to another entity by the operation of a Transfer Order.

Thus, a test of effective control of 3 VTs must be framed as
follows: should Player X, at a given time, wish to remain in
possession of these Currencies, or wish to issue a Transfer Order to
another entity for that amout, would e be able to do so ? 

Now, the argument offered by Murphy is that a post worded thusly :
"I hereby withdraw my Power of Attorney, then transfer 3 VTs to the
Bank" would be effective, whether posted before, at or after the
time under consideration, and that therefore a Grantor of eir Power
of Attorney retains effective control of eir Currencies.

But this only adresses one half of the test, the case where the
Grantor wishes to transfer possession; what about the case where e
wishes to retain possession ? One can argue that the Grantor does not
have the ability to ensure that, since the Holder might, as long as e
hold the Power of Attorney for the Grantor, effect a Transfer Order
on behalf of the Grantor.

My conclusion would be that Kolja was not in effective control of 3
VTs at the time under consideration, because of the possibility that
Steve, by transferring enough VTs from Kolja to another entity,
could at that time ensure that Kolja would not be able to transfer
or keep 3 VTs if he so wished, and Kolja could not prevent that.

I don't believe this.  You might as well say that Kolja was not in
effective control of his 3 VTs because the Registrar might at exactly
the same moment have just hit "Send" on a message billing him for 6
VTs.  This would be just as much outside of his control as Steve's
putative embezzlement, but would also leave him without 3 VTs under
his effective control.  (Given that I believe the definition of
"effective" was specifically meant to exempt someone who might have 3
VTs but impending or current debts such that his net worth was less
than 3 VTs.)

Of course, the fact that Kolja could have at any stage removed this
ability of Steve's to dispose of his Currencies also suggests that
they were under his effective control.  

Michael.

At the time the Proposals were distributed, he could have withdrawn
his Power of Attorney and immediately spent his VTs.  Thus, he
had effective control over them at that time.

Then e need merely withdraw eir Power of Attorney.  Just as the
Grantor can transfer currencies as e wishes, e can retain currencies as
e wishes.

It doesn't look that way to me, then. If I have 3 VTs in my name,
but am subject to POs for 6 VTs, I see nothing in the Rules that
would prevent me from transferring these VTs to entities other than
the Payees of these POs, should I so wish. 

I would be incurring the risk of a PI Infraction, to be sure; but
then for all anyone knows I might also receive a windfall of VTs
immediately after that and be in a position to pay these debts, so I
don't see how you can argue that owning a VT debt deprives you of
effective control over those VTs that you do own.

Thus I dispute this, since in that case Kolja would still be able to
transfer 3 VTs to someone other than the Payee of this putative
Payment Order, and be within his rights to do so, and stand on the 
position that Steve, on the other hand, does have the ability to 
deprive Kolja of effective control over his Kolja's VTs.

One bothersome complication, though, is that Transfer Orders only
'take effect', so to speak, at the time the RecordKeepor for the
relevant Currency receives them. In the meantime, the amount of that
Currency owned by the transferring Player remains the same, or so it
seems to me - and that would imply that until such time as the TO is
actually recorded by the RK, the transferring Player is *still* in
control of the same VTs e has just transferred away; after all, if
eir TO is never received by the RK for whatever reason, or received
late, that Player is still able to submit other TOs which, if they
are themselves received, will be successful.

Only if he beats Steve to the punch, though; and that's the rub. I
trust you are not disputing that *Steve* does have effective control
over Koja's Currencies; we are debating whether Steve alone does, or
both Steve and Kolja do.

I submit that Steve's control robs Kolja of eir own's, because while
Kolja has the ability to transfer VTs away at any moment, he doesn't
have the ability to ensure that these VTs remain his to give away
*until* he withdraws his PoA. And we do know that at the time under
consideration, i.e. at the time the Proposals were distributed, Steve
was still the Holder of Kolja's PoA.

But you must admit that Kolja could have withdrawn his PoA. And if
the fact that Kolja didn't withdraw his PoA is relevant, than surely
the fact that Steve did not in fact rob him of his assets is as well.
Had Steve taken possession of Kolja's assets for just a brief
moment, while the Proposals were distributed, and then transferred
them back, then I would agree that Kolja didn't have effective
control. But the fact is that Steve didn't do that. 
  Here's an analogy. Would you consider me to have "effective control"
of the assets I have in my bank account? Surely yes, even though it
is possible for the bank to go bankrupt or to steal my money
(forgetting for the moment the Federal Insurance rules). Unless
that actually happens, I have no defense for the tax man.

It seems to me that either they both have effective control or neither
does.  Both can spend the VTs as they see fit as there are actions for
both of them that achieve that end. 

They can also both pre-emptively stop the other from spending the VTs
and making them exclusively their own:
   Steve transfers them from Kolja's ownership to his own; 
   Kolja removes the grant of the PoA

As far as Morendil's definition of "effective control" goes (and it's
a not unreasonable one), both are equally capable of both spending and
preventing the other from spending the Currency.  

Maybe there are other ways of distinguishing Steve's control of the
holding from Kolja's, but ability-to-spend, and
ability-to-retain-exclusively are no good.

Of course, this last issue (interesting though it is) is not really
the issue at question.  Rather, the Appelate Board needs to decide
whether or not Kolja had "effective control", not whether or not Steve
had more or less control than him.  If the rule had said "exclusive
effective control" then the story would be very different.

Yes, this is a nice analogy.  It seems reasonable to equate "effective
control over X" with the ability to perform arbitrary actions that
require X, but it is perhaps not so reasonable to hold that "effective
control over X" is equivalent with the ability to forever retain the
ability to perform those arbitrary actions.  

This latter ability is logically much stronger as it is dependent on
the future state of the universe, while the former ability is
dependent solely on the state of the world right now.

Well, there is a real distinction between the two cases.
Like the difference between potential and kinetic energy.
Rule 1842 states, "When the Holder is granted Power of Attorney
for the Grantor, that means that the Holder becomes the sole
                                                        ^^^^
Executor for the Grantor for as long as e has that Power of
Attorney."  Under Agora Rules, only the Executor has the power
to compel a Recordkeepor to record a transfer of currency.
Therefore the following statement is true:

As long as Player B has Power of Attorney over Player A,
only Player B can force the Recordkeepor to transfer
currency from Player A and Player A cannot prevent
Player B from making such a transfer.

Now it is true that, at any time, Player A can revoke POA
from Player B and so has continuous *potential* control
over eir Currency.  I remain unconvinced as to whether
this "potential" control over assets is equivalent to
"effective" control, for the following reason.  Suppose
Player A has unwittingly granted POA to Player B who has
the evil intent of robbing Player A.  Although theoretically
Player A could prevent Player B from carrying out the
robbery at any time, Player A would have to discover B's
evil intentions in time in order to actually prevent it.
This does not sound like particularly *effective* control
of an asset.

OTOH, this potential control *does* give a Player the ability
to actually pay for a vote at any time, which may be enough
to satisfy the definition in R1873, if one cares to give

Clearly, the fact that a Bank or anyone else can rob you of your
assets at any time does not prevent you from having control
over them.  But, IMO, the RL analogies such as this, given so far,
do not really apply to the current situation, because in
each case the person who has granted custodianship or power
of attorney over assets continuously retains the direct ability
to dispose of those assets.  This is not the case for Agoran POA.

People keep on saying that Kolja could remove the power of attorney from 
Steve at any time.  Surely, this depends on the reason why Kolja gave 
Steve the power of attorney in the first place.  E.g. if he was going to 
climb a hill for a couple of weeks.  In that case he would not be able 
to remove the power of attorney from steve at any time.

Peekee

PS This does not imply that Kolja was away climbing hills, it was just 
an example, sorry Kolja.

What happens if the bank is closed, do you still have "effective control 
at that time."

Actually yes, I can write a check. But surely your objection doesn't
apply here, since for Kolja to get his stuff back no action of 
Steve's is required.

I've been lurking for a while, but this discussion of effective control has
a few points which nobody else has brought up yet, so...
	I think that you have effective control over an asset when there is
no reasonable expectation of any negative consequence for executing a
transfer order for that asset, other than the loss of the asset.  In plain
english, you have effective control when you can spend it without a penalty.
You don't have effective control when you have outstanding debts for that
asset because then there is a reasonable expectation of paying the penalty
for persistent indebtedness if you don't use the asset to pay off the debt.
In Kolja's case, I believe that the fact that Kolja would need to revoke his
PoA first is not relevant to asserting control.  However, the fact that the
PoA could not be immediately restored does constitute a penalty - he would
be forced to assume a game status which he did not wish to for a period of
time.  Whether that penalty is significant enough to constitute reasons for
claiming that he did not have effective control is an issue for a judge.
However, there is more...
	Another issue that seems to be confused to me is the distinction
between Kolja the person, and Kolja the player.  While Kolja the person may
or may not have had effective control of the VT belonging to Kolja the
player, there is no question that Kolja the player did have effective
control of it's VT.  In this case, Kolja the player could easily have voted
without penalty by Steve sending a message to the PF as the executor of
Kolja the player.
  	There are some interesting consequences from pointing out the
distinction between people and players.  For example the rules state that it
is players who hold PoA.  Therefore in this case, Steve the person is the
executor of Steve the player, which is the executor of Kolja the player.
There are grounds for stating that Steve the player had effective control of
more than 3 VT (I don't know if it did or not, this is hypothetical) through
it's executorship of Kolja the player - which results in a duty to vote
being imposed twice for the same 3 VTs.  If Steve had no VTs he would be in
the unfortunate position of being required to transfer some of Kolja's VTs
to himself, and then using them to vote.
	In summary, I think that a duty to vote is broken with respect to
the power of attourney rules.  You can end up in a situation with multiple
players having effective control of a single set of VTs (one because of
ownership, and the other as executor of the first).  However, since a duty
to vote can only be satisfied by that player voting, you get a situation
where multiple players have a duty to vote with a single set of 3 VTs.

Welcome, lurker!  Hope you find your stay comfortable enough to plunge

A reasonable argument for maintaining that debts deprive you of "effective"
control.

I think the fact that a Player needs to revoke PoA in order to assert
control is relevant in the sense that we need to determine if that
requirement is sufficient to deprive a Player of "effective" control
over VTs.  Unless e revokes PoA first, e *cannot* transfer currency.
As I pointed out in my previous post, there can be negative consequences
because of this requirement that are outside the direct control of
the Player granting PoA.  By your argument above, I would think that
you would then say PoA *does* deprive a Player of effective control.

Be warned, R869 "A Player is any person who is registered as a Player." is
interpreted to mean that there is *no* distinction between the Player and
the corresponding person.  For some reason, this issue brings up a lot
of strong feelings on the part of some Players.  8)

I believe your summary conclusion is correct, although I would say that
it is independent of making any distinction between Player and person.
Since accepting PoA can give a Player control over additional VTs (I don't
think anyone disagrees with this) then, if you accept the argument that
the original Player *still* has effective control, three VTs is sufficient
to cause more than one Player to incur a Duty to Vote.

I am not sure that I agree that this is what it means in the current
Rules.  And, although not relevant to the current judgement, I don't think
it is what we want the Rule to mean, either.

I think the "effective control" language is broken in any case - what we
need is a general system for avoiding tax evasion, of which this is
essentially a special case.

Now this is another issue, which by the way shows that you haven't been
watching _that_ long, as it tends to pop up regularly.  In Agora there is
no difference between a person and the corresponding Player, and this is
well established - the opposite "avatar" concept is being discussed
occasionally, but it has not been tried out in practice yet - the closest
thing is the Executor and Attorney concepts.

Greetings,

Now, don't be *that* harsh on Steven.  I think it's been well over a

Let me try to rephrase this.  In summary, I feel that the fact that Kolja
granted his PoA to Steve did not affect Kolja's ability to vote at all.  It
simply means that in order for Kolja to vote, Steve needs to send a message
to the PF, as Kolja's executor.  
  In the process of thinking about people and players, I have come up with
the following argument for your consideration.  I can see that the rules do
not require a distinction between people and players, but the way people
have been interpreting the rules does imply such a distinction. Consider:
a)    The Executor of an entity is a Player who is empowered by the Rules to
act on behalf of that entity, as if e was that entity.
b)     When the Holder is granted Power of Attorney for the Grantor, that
means that the Holder becomes the sole Executor for the Grantor for as long
as e has that Power of Attorney.
from rule1841:
c)     The giving Player shall be known, for this Rule, as the Grantor. 
d)     This grant shall end when one of the following occurs; ...       ii)
The Grantor posts in the Public Forum that e is withdrawing eir Power of
Attorney.
	We know from c that the Grantor is a player.
	We know from b that the Holder is the Executor of the Grantor.
	We also know from b that the Grantor is not the Executor of the
Grantor (sole Executor)
	Therefore, from a, the Grantor is not empowered by the rules to act
on the behalf of the Grantor  (I think that you could reasonably claim here
that the Grantor didn't need to be so empowered, by virtue of actually being
the Grantor, but that implies that Kolja did not need to revoke the PoA in
order to vote, which everyone has been assuming.)
	But this implies that d means that the only person able to post a
message to the PF to revoke PoA is the Holder of that PoA, acting as
executor for the Grantor.  (Seeing as the Grantor can't act on his own
behalf, or as if he were the Grantor, from a).
	In my opinion, the intent of the PoA rules is that you can grant
your PoA to someone else, and let them run things for a while, revoking that
if they start abusing it.  The judgement call here is whether the Grantor
can always act on his own behalf.  If he can, then he continues to be able
to vote and perform other actions while he has granted PoA.  If he can't,
then he can't revoke his PoA until it expires normally.  Most participants
in this discussion have been assuming both that Kolja could not vote, and
that he could revoke his PoA.  This makes sense, if you assume that there is
some entity, distinct from the player, which can revoke PoA.

Trade for an Indulgence.  Or try for a successful Revolt, and meanwhile
don't bother paying your Indulgence debt.

"Only Players may be Senators."  I think Rule 1011 covers the rest.

This would not only affect new Players two months after their registration,
but also Players who had been removed from the Senate two months ago.  Was
this your intent?

What if there's a tie?

I would suggest adjusting the Without Objection mechanism to simplify your
work.  Something like this:

1) Amend Rule 1728 (Actions Without N Objections) so that a Rule specifying
   an Action Without N Objections may also specify that objections from
   certain Players are ignored for this purpose.

2) Define "Without N Senator Objections".

3) "A Senator may, Without Senate Objection, cause a Player to become a
    Senator."

 be a Senator."

How was *my* reaction overdoing it?  Scott called for Impeachment.  I only
called for an Election, which Andre might have won.

I disagree with this conclusion.  I believe that both Steve and Kolja
have control over Kolja's Currencies while Steve holds defeasible
Power of Attorney.  For Steve's Power of Attorney to give Steve
exclusive control of Kolja's Currencies, the Power of Attorney would
have to be indefeasable, and our Rules do not create such a
relationship.

Hm, so the next time I get so busy with classwork to find the time to

I should raise that as a defense?  I'll be relying on this come

It is reasonably well-resolved that there is no distinction between
persons and Players; a Player is a type of person, not an abstract
entity placed in correspondence with a person.

This statement is inconsistent with established Game Custom, general
agreement, and the sense of the Rules.  Players are persons, not
entities of which persons are the Executors.  See Rules 1478, 869, and
1432.

As has also been judged by yours humbly in the Judgement of CFJ 833. Quote:

  A Player is not 'automagically' created when a person registers. What
  happens, as Rule 869 shows, is that the person (an existing entity, although
  perhaps not an Entity yet) becomes a Player, i.e. is placed in a certain
  Category of Entities. This can be compared with the way Groups became
  Organizations under the Group/Contest/Contract Consolidation: There were no
  new Organizations formed to correspond to the old Groups, but the old
  Groups were placed in the Category of Game Entities which are
  'Organizations', and thus became Organizations. Likewise when someone
  registers, no new Player is formed, or even filled, but the person is
  placed in the Category Players. All this is implied by Rule 869, which
  equates the person to the Player, not just makes them correspond to one
  another.

and elJefe, in CFJ 869, states:

  The caller argues that the person and the Player are identical, are one
  and the same person, and that actions (e-mail messages) by the one are
  actions by the other.  This must be TRUE, and I so judge it.

On the other hand, Michael in CFJ 886 stated:

  Finally, I note that Game Custom doesn't prohibit two or more
  different people being the same Player.

I think it would be better to amend paragraph 2 of Rule 698 (but keeping
the Caller emself ineligible as well.)

Nonsense, Scott, your activity level goes *up* during finals.  Perfectly
understandable--I think mine did too when I was in school. :)

I should extend this point with the observation that there is no
absolute reason why this must be the case.  Other Nomics ascribe to
the opposite view, and they seem to do just fine.  I recently looked
at the Rules of one Nomic which makes this distinction explicit.  The
downfall with that that Nomic's model is that requires some rather
complex language to cope with the fact that the Rules may (and often
do) wish to limit actions of the person controlling the Player rather
than the abstract Player.  Recognizing the two separately makes doing
that more difficult, or at least more complex.

The Grantor would have to retract the Power of Attorney to Vote
because the ability to communicate a Vote is a power that inheres in
the Executor, not the Player.  One of the things that came out of The
Zombie Crisis was that a Player who is not (for some reason) eir own
Executor may still perform any act permitted of em by virtue of being
a Player, and such acts will have their usual legal effect.  The
Grantor need not "act on eir own behalf" precisely because e is
capable of acting as emself.  

In other words, we do not presume that the grant of power to the
Holder creates a legal disability in the Grantor, with respect to
those powers of a Player that inhere peculiarily in Players, and not
generically in Executors.  Rather, those powers inhere simultaneously
in both Grantor and Holder for the duration of the Power of Attorney.

(All hail Wesley Hohfeld!)

Up to this point, I agree with you.

Here I disagree with you.  In certain cases, the Rules specifically
require an entity's Executor to do something, and in those cases
I agree the Grantor cannot perform those actions on eir own
behalf.  But more generally, I think perhaps the Grantor can still
act on eir own behalf.   I do not believe (a) prevents this.

On this latter, you may have a point--I'm not sure that Kolja does need to
revoke PoA in order to vote for emself.

Then the Grantor could revoke Power of Attorney and keep the Currency.  Or
if e wished to give back Power of Attorney after locking down the Currency,
then e could (for instance) transfer it to a Contest with Regulations
stating
that the Contestmaster's Executor (if a different Player) may not do
anything
to that Contest.

I would argue that effective control is not prevented by the ability of the
Holder to take Currency for emself, but only if the Holder actually does so.

I would also argue that the momentary break in Power of Attorney is
unimportant.  The Grantor can give back Power of Attorney immediately after
locking down the Currency; if the Holder refuses, then e could just as
easily have revoked Power of Attorney emselves, by posting on behalf of
the Grantor.

And the actual state of affairs is that the Grantor *could* have spent
VTs as e saw fit.  The definition of "effective control" doesn't require
that any actual spending occurred.

	[Steven Damer]  A player is a voting entity in it's own right (rule
206).  Rule 683 states that a voting entity votes on a proposal by sending a
message to the PF.  You could take a later clause from 683 concerning voting
by entities without executors to imply that it is necessary to be an
executor to vote as outlined in the first clause, but I think that the only
implication that should be drawn is that it is necessary to have an executor
to vote as outlined in the first clause.  Is there something else that I'm
missing that outlines the relationship between voting entities and executors
more explicitly?

I incorrectly asserted that Voting was an Executorial power; I was in
error in this regard.  Voting does in fact appear to be an inherent
power; therefore, I would conclude that a Player who has granted Power 
of Attorney may nonetheless still Vote.

I've gone off on a tangent regarding the relationship between players and
executors and voting.  In regard to the effective control issue, what do
people think of the argument that Kolja had effective control of more than 3
VTs through the action of his executor?  In other words since Kolja could
have voted (by Steve sending a message to the PF), he had a duty to vote.

Citation?  I don't see that in R683 (although I haven't looked at other
Rules).

Protoproposal Chaos72 [rev. 4]

Simplify Probate

Be it resolved, that Rules 1637, 1738, 1739 and 1757 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1601 be amended to read:

      (a) An entity is inanimate if it:
        (1) possesses any number of units of Currency, and
        (2) does not have an Executor.

      (b) The Notary may perform any of the following with respect to
          a inanimate entity:
        (1) transfer Currencies owned by the inanimate entity for the
            purpose of satisfying a Payment Order naming the inanimate
            entity as payor;
        (2) Without Objection, vacate any Payment Order naming the
            inanimate entity as payor or payee; or
        (3) Without Objection, transfer Currencies owned by that
            entity to the Bank.

      (c) The Notary is authorized, all other Rules notwithstanding,
          to transfer Currency from any inanimate entity to any other
          entity as if e were the inanimate entity's Executor, when e
          is permitted to do so in accordance with subdivision (b) of
          this Rule.

      (d) A inanimate entity is considered to continue to have legal
          existence as long as it continues to possess units of
          Currency, even if it is dissolved, destroyed, or otherwise
          would cease to have legal existence prior to that time.
