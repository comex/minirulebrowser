It looks increasingly as if Michael has not made any TOs to pay the
Salary POs he issued on Aug 2, 8, 14, 24, 31 and Sep 6. I'm amazed I

I agree the import of the Judgement is difficult to summarize. Therefore
I suggest an unofficial annotation as follows:

[CFJ 790 contains a detailed discussion on what does and does not
qualify as a random choice.]

Thinking about it more, I think my original reaction was the correct
one. If a Player has insufficient funds to make a Transfer, then the RK
is instructed to ignore it. The RK is not instructed to stop ignoring it
once sufficient funds become available, so I think the correct thing for
em to do in the circumstances is just to go on ignoring it indefinitely.

Except that I specified the wrong date. The TOs specified below are for
POs issued prior to Aug 2, and are all already accounted for in lee's
Report. These seems to be the last Salary TOs to have beem ade by
Chancellor Michael that anyone has been able to find so far.

[etc.]

Nope. This is the message in which Michael issues the Salary *Payment*
Orders for the week ending August 9. Records of these POs exist and they
have been listed in lee's Report. But no-one has been able to find any
trace of these POs being satisfied by any corresponding Transfer Orders.
Blob has hypothesized that Michael has been waiting for the Accountor to
acknowledge receipt of the POs.

Got them!  Had them. Steve, this is one of the things that delayed me. 
I looked and looked for more bank transactions.  I was embarrassed that
i had missed them, but  i finally gave it one more good search and
published the report.  The other delay was the reassigning of PO
numbers.  The form aaa999 is most useful.  it is short  and  easily
searched for.  Michael's pointing out the pair of matching PO's gave me
the inspiration to sort by date and payor and payee and amount ignoring
time. I have in each case registered the time it went through gecko. 
If there is a dispute i can search and find the sent time as blob now
tells me that is the standard.  Can i recalculate now?  Or should i
wait?

I think

It hasn't been done.  As Chancellor I both wanted to (and was entitled
to, I believe) rely on an official reqport listing POs.  I haven't
made any VT transfers from the Bank since satisfying those required in
the last report (2 August).

When the state of play settles down wrt Lee's report, I will pay all
of the outstanding salaries.

Michael.

Dear fellow Internomicers of the Pumpkin Patch,

Recently your representative to IN, the GRAPE, explained your policy
concerning IN proposals. E mentioned three key factors in this policy:

>>
1.  Is it good for the Patch?
2.  Will Agora suffer because of it?
3.  Have they asked nicely?
<<

It is, of course, not in the interest of Agora to meddle with other IN
members' internal affairs. And we do appreciate that you published
these guidelines, because that helped to avoid the unpleasant, and
fortunately wrong, impression that the Patch is blocking IN proposals
whimsically and without considering their merits.

However, the requirement that "Agora suffer" has us confused and
surprized. We Agorans do not understand why the Patch should be
interested to hurt us.

Recently there have been accusations against Agora, saying that some
tiome ago some of our players joined another nomic with the intent of
changing its rules. While some participants in the ensuing debate
simply stated that an intention to change the rules is an essential
motivation for playing in any nomic game, I have also demonstrated
that all allegations that Agora players ever "invaded" another nomic
and/or caused any damage there, against the will of the established
players, are unfounded and have no facts to support them.

I would therefore be glad to hear from the Patch whether our
impression that an anti-Agoran attitude prevails in the Patch is due
to a misunderstanding, or to any questions which we may resolve in a
peaceful and civilized debate, or whether this attitude is a result of
the playfully non-serious general athmosphere that seems to reign in
the Patch in general, or of any other random influence beyond your
explicit control.

I must stress that I am asking for such an explanation, not in a
threatening or aggressive way (why, and how, should I?), but out of a
genuine curiosity to understand the issue, and to figure out whether,
and how, Agora should respond to the situation.

Looking forward to your reply,

Kolja A., Agora ambassador to IN and other nomics.


Technical P.S. :

It would be nice to see your reply on the agora discussion mailing
list, to which I cc'ed this mail. However, because we've had spam
problems on the list, only people subscribed to the list can post
messages to it. 

So if you want to reply to the general Agora public, you can either
reply to me and mention that I may distribute your posts to Agora, or
you can subscribe to the mailing list

agora-discussion@gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au 

by sending a mail to 

Majordomo@gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au 

with the message body "subscribe agora-discussion". Note that this
list is only used to conduct informal discussions, and joining this
list or sending any posts to it has no consequences whatsoever for the
game, gamestate etc. of Agora nomic.

Hm.  Do they allow CGI scripts?  It should be possible to put some kind of
listing together for those particular directories...

Greetings,

That seems reasonable.  Thanks.
