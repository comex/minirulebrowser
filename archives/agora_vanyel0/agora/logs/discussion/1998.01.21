Protoproposal Chaos22 [rev. 9]

The Omnibus Reform Act of 1998

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1503 be amended to read:

      Any entity who performs an action defined by the Rules to be a
      Crime, or fails to perform an action where such failure is
      defined by the Rules to be a Crime, shall be subject to whatever
      penalty the Rules prescribe for that Crime upon the execution of
      a Sentencing Order executed consequent to a judicial finding
      that e did in fact commit that Crime.

      Any entity who performs an action defined by the Rules to be an
      Infraction, or fails to perform an action where such failure is
      defined by the Rules to be an Infraction, shall be subject to
      whatever penalty the Rules prescribe for that Infraction upon a
      Notice of Infraction stating that e committed that Infraction.

      A Notice of Infraction stating that an entity has committed a
      specific Infraction consists of a report by a Player authorized
      to report instances of that specific Infraction that it is eir
      informed belief that the specified entity has committed the
      specified Infraction.  A Notice of Infraction shall also specify
      the penalty to be imposed for that Infraction.

      No action is a Crime or an Infraction unless defined as such by
      the Rules.  If the Rules define an act to be a Crime or an
      Infraction, but fail to prescribe a penalty for that act, then
      there is no penalty for that act.  If the Rules define an act to
      be an Infraction, but fail to authorize any Player or Players to
      report instances of that Infraction, then that Infraction cannot
      be reported.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1504 be amended to read:

      The imposition of penalties for the commission of a Crime shall
      be by Sentencing Order(s).  Upon a judicial finding that an
      entity has committed a Crime, the Judge so finding shall execute
      Sentencing Orders sufficient to implement the penalty required
      by the Rules for that Crime.

      The imposition of penalties for the commission of an Infraction
      shall be by the execution of a Notice of Infraction.  The Player
      executing the Notice of Infraction shall, at the time e does so,
      also execute Orders sufficient to implement the penalty required
      by the Rules for that Infraction.

      The punishment for a Crime or Infraction shall be whatever was
      specified by the Rules at the time the action so designated as a
      Crime or an Infraction was committed, even if the Rule or Rules
      which specified the punishment, or which designated the action
      as a Crime or Infraction, have since been amended or repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1652 be amended to read:

      No entity shall be subject to penalties more than once for a
      single instance of a particular Crime or Infraction, any other
      Rule notwithstanding.

      Any CFJ whose Statement alleges that an entity has, through
      action or inaction, committed a Crime shall be dismissed if
      there is a prior CFJ, the statement of which alleges that the
      same entity has, through the same action or inaction, committed
      the same Crime, and which was itself not dismissed.

      This Rule in no way bars the imposition of multiple penalties
      for the same act (or failure to act) if such action (or
      inaction) constitutes multiple Crimes, multiple Infractions, or
      any combination thereof.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      A penalty denying Voting Privileges to an entity for a period of
      time shall be imposed by ordering the Assessor to deny Voting
      Privilege to the named Voting Entity for that period of time.
      The denial of Voting Privilege begins with the beginning of the
      first full Nomic Week after the Order takes effect, and
      continues for the period specified.
 
      While the Assessor is ordered to deny Voting Privilege to a
      Voting Entity, that Voting Entity shall be entitled to cast no
      Votes on any Proposal, any other Rule to the contrary
      notwithstanding.

      The duration of the period of denial is tolled while an Order
      denying Voting Privilege is stayed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1509 be amended to read:

      Upon a judicial finding that a Player has failed to perform a
      duty required of em by the Rules, the Judge so finding shall
      execute an Order requiring that Player to perform that duty as
      soon as possible.

      If the duty in question arises because the Player in question
      holds a specific Office or other position of official
      responsibility, the Order shall bind that Office or position.
      If the Player holding that Office fails to perform the duty in
      question as ordered, the Judge shall Order that that Player be
      removed from Office or position.

      If the duty in question arises for a reason not related to the
      Player in question holding a specific Office or official
      position, and that Player fails to perform the duty as ordered,
      the Judge shall amend the Order to require the Speaker to
      perform that duty instead.

      The refusal of the Speaker to perform a duty when ordered to do
      so by a Judge according to this Rule constitutes being an
      Impossible Speaker, as defined elsewhere.

      The failure of a Player to perform a duty required of em by
      virtue of being a Judge is not subject to review by the
      procedures established in this Rule.  Any CFJ alleging that a
      Judge has failed to perform a duty of a judicial nature shall be
      dismissed.

      A CFJ alleging that the Clerk of the Courts has failed to
      perform a duty of eir Office may, at the Caller's option, be
      filed with the Justiciar, who shall then perform all the duties
      of the Clerk of the Courts with respect to that CFJ.

Be it therefore resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      An Order is a command, executed by a Player and directed to some
      entity requiring that entity to perform exactly one action, or
      to refrain from performing one or more actions.  An Order may be
      directed to the holder of an Office or other official position
      in eir capacity as that Office or other official position, and
      in this case if the Office or position changes hands before the
      Order is satisfied, the duty to abide by the Order automatically
      attaches to the new holder of that Office or position.  An
      Order, the purpose of which is to affect the operation of a
      prior Order, is as valid as any other Order, even if not
      directed at any particular entity.

      There are four classes of Order: Administrative, Judicial,
      Appellate, and Private.  A Judicial Order is an Order executed
      by a Player while acting as a Judge.  An Appellate Order is an
      Order executed by a Board of Appeals.  An Administrative Order
      is an Order executed by the holder of an Office or other
      official position (such as the Speaker or the Recordkeepor of a
      Currency) other than that of a Judge or Justice, in the course
      of performing the duties of that Office or position.  A Private
      Order is any other sort of Order.

      All Orders executed in the manner prescribed by the Rules for
      their class and type are presumed valid and enforceable until
      proven otherwise by CFJ.  However, in order to be proven valid
      by CFJ, the Rules must permit the Player who executed the Order
      in question to execute such an Order, that the execution of the
      Order must have been required by or permitted in the
      circumstances which existed at the time it was executed, and
      that the Order has not been rendered invalid by the operation of
      any other Rule.  Furthermore, no Order may act to prevent or
      hinder its own appeal in any way, and any portion of an Order
      which has this effect is void and without force.

      Knowingly and willfully executing invalid Orders constitutes the
      Class B Crime of Abuse of Authority.

      A Player who performs as required by an Order which is later
      found to be invalid is not liable for eir actions; but other
      Rules may establish procedures for correcting or remediating
      such circumstances when they occur.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      Generally, any Order may be amended, stayed, or vacated by the
      Player who executed it; certain classes of Orders may be
      amended, stayed, or vacated in other circumstances as well, when
      the Rules so allow.  In all cases, this is done by an Order to
      Amend, Stay, or Vacate, respectively, the original Order.
      Otherwise, an Order shall not be amended, stayed, vacated, or
      otherwise changed once executed.

      The effect of amending an Order is to cause it to be effective
      in its amended form.  The prior form of the Order ceases to have
      effect upon the amendment, and the new form has effect as if it
      had been originally executed in that form at the moment the
      amendment becomes effective.  Vacating an Order to Amend has the
      same effect as would an Order to Amend which reinstates the
      previous form of the Order.

      The effect of staying an Order is to temporarily deny the stayed
      Order from having any effect.  A stay may be ordered for a fixed
      time, in which case the stay expires at the time specified; or
      for an indefinite time, in which case the stay will not expire.
      If no specification is made in the Order to Stay, the stay shall
      be indefinite.  When the stay expires or is vacated, the
      previously stayed order again has effect as if it had been
      originally executed at the moment the stay ceases to be
      effective.  However, if the stayed Order is vacated while
      stayed, it does not regain effect when the stay expires or is
      lifted.

      The effect of vacating an Order is to permanently deny the
      vacated Order from having any effect.  Vacating an Order to
      Vacate reinstates the ability of the vacated Order to have
      effect, as of the moment the Order to Vacate is itself vacated.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:
      
      Judicial Orders are executed by being sent to the Clerk of the
      Courts, but do not take effect until their publication by the
      Clerk of the Courts.  The Clerk of the Courts shall publish each
      Judicial Order as soon as possible after receiving it from the
      Judge who executed it.

      Judicial Orders are subject to appeal to a Board of Appeal by a
      Call for Appeal.  The Board of Appeal shall, upon finding that a
      Judicial Order is improperly or invalidly executed, order that
      that Order be amended or vacated, as they deem appropriate.
      When the Clerk of the Courts receives a properly executed Call
      for Appeal of a Judicial Order, the Clerk of the Courts shall
      stay the Order under appeal.  If the Board of Appeals affirms
      the validity of the original Order, it shall then vacate this
      stay.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      Appellate Orders are executed by being sent to the Clerk of the
      Courts by the Lead Justice of a Board of Appeals, but do not
      take effect until their publication by the Clerk of the Courts.
      The Lead Justice shall certify in eir submission to the Clerk of
      the Courts that the Order is executed by the concurrence of the
      majority of the Justices comprising that Board of Appeals;
      failure to do so deprives the Order of effect.  The Clerk of the
      Courts shall publish each Appellate Order as soon as possible
      after receiving it from the Board of Appeal which executed it.

      Appellate Orders are not subject to appeal except by Motion to
      Reconsider.  However, upon a judicial finding that the
      certification required by this Rule was falsely provided, the
      Justiciar shall vacate the Order which was accompanied by that
      false certification.

      The Lead Justice of a Board of Appeals is the Justiciar, if e is
      serving on that Board, or the Player who serves in the place of
      the Justiciar otherwise.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      Administrative Orders are executed by being published in the
      Public Forum, and take effect upon publication.

      Private Orders are executed by submitting them directly to the
      Player to be commanded, and take effect upon submission.

      Both Administrative and Private Orders are subject to appeal by
      a CFJ, the statement of which Statement alleges that the Order
      is improperly or invalidly executed.  Upon a judicial finding
      that an Administrative or Private Order was improperly or
      invalidly executed, the Judge so finding shall vacate that
      Order.  When the Clerk of the Courts receives a properly
      executed Call for Judgement, the statement of which alleges that
      an Administrative or Private Order was improperly or invalidly
      executed, the Clerk of the Courts shall stay the Order in
      dispute.  If the Judge affirms the validity of the original
      Order, e shall then vacate this stay.  

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1736 be repealed.  [Rule 1736 is
redundant; a Judge's Order to pay Currency is a Payment Order in its
own right.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1737 be repealed.  [Rule 1737 is
redundant; Payment Orders are Orders subject to appeal according to
the processes detailed above and can be vacated directly according to
those procedures.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1599 be amended to read:

      Whenever a Rule requires a Player to execute a Payment Order, e
      shall do so within seven days of when the requirement arises.

[Rule 1599 is almost wholly redundant; the failure to execute a
Payment Order falls within the scope of the amended Rule 1509.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1598 be amended to read:

      A Transfer Order is an Order requiring the Recordkeepor of a
      Currency to note the transfer of units of that Currency from one
      entity to another.  A valid Transfer Order specifies exactly one
      source entity, exactly one destination entity, exactly one
      Currency, and a number of units of that Currency which is a
      positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ.

      A Recordkeepor is required to abide by all valid Transfer Orders
      submitted by the Executor of the owner of the units of Currency
      to be transferred (or, with respect to any entity which lacks an
      Executor, by any other person empowered by the Rules to execute
      Transfer Orders on the behalf of such entities), except for
      those transfers which would result in an entity possessing a
      negative quantity of Currency.  Transfers shall be noted on the
      Recordkeepor's records in the order in which they are received
      by the Recordkeepor.

      If a Recordkeepor notes a transfer pursuant to a Transfer Order
      which is subsequently vacated, e shall correct eir records as
      soon as possible after the Transfer Order is vacated by noting a
      transfer which is the reverse of the transfer originally noted.
      However, if such a reversing transfer would result in an entity
      possessing a negative quantity of units of Currency, e shall
      instead execute a Payment Order requiring a Transfer Order that
      would have the same effect as the reversing transfer.

      The effect of noting a transfer on the records of the
      Recordkeepor is to remove the specified number of units of
      Currency from the holdings of the source entity and to add the
      specified number of units of Currency to the holdings of the
      destination entity.

      Each Recordkeepor shall maintain a record of all Transfer Orders
      submitted which specify the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor, for at least four weeks after their submission,
      and a complete record of all transfers noted upon eir records
      for at least four weeks.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1746 be repealed.  [Rule 1746 is
redundant; a CFJ alleging that a Transfer Order is illegal would, if
found true, result in the vacation of that Transfer Order, which would
then trigger a reversing transfer or Payment Order under the revised
Rule 1598, above.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1730 be amended to read:

      The Recordkeepor of a Currency may, at eir discretion, elect to
      refuse any Transfer Order which requires em to note a transfer
      at any time other than as soon as possible after the Order
      itself became effective.  The Recordkeepor's election to refuse
      an Transfer Order in this fashion renders invalid that Order
      provided that the Recordkeepor sends a message to the Player who
      executed the Order informing him of eir election, within seven
      days of the receipt of that Order.

      This Rule does not apply to Transfer Orders which are required
      by the Rules to be executed with a specification that the
      transfer be noted at a time other than as soon as possible after
      they become effective.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1731 be repealed.  [Implicit
Transfer Orders are a pain, and exist only to support Voting.  The
conversion to paying for Votes after the fact eliminates the need for
this.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1596 be amended to read:

      A Payment Order is an Order requiring an entity (the payor) to
      submit a Transfer Order transferring units of a Currency from
      itself to some other entity (the payee).  A Payment Order
      specifies exactly one source entity, exactly one destination
      entity, exactly one Currency, and a number of units of that
      Currency which is a positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ.

      A Payment Order is only valid if a copy has been filed with the
      Recordkeepor of the Currency specified in it, and takes effect
      no sooner than the time of such filing.  (Publishing the Payment
      Order in the Public Forum is sufficient to meet this
      requirement.)

      Each Recordkeepor shall maintain a record of all Payment Orders
      filed with em which specify the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor.  This record shall also indicate, for each Order,
      if that Order has been satisfied, vacated, or both.  However,
      the Recordkeepor need only maintain records of satisfied or
      vacated Orders for four weeks after they have been satisfied or
      vacated.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1733 be repealed.  [The automatic
stay of Orders under CFJ renders Rule 1733 effectively redundant.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1734 be amended to read:

      When a satisfied Payment Order is vacated, the Recordkeepor of
      the Currency named in that Payment Order shall execute a new
      Payment Order identical to the vacated Payment Order, but with
      the payor and payee interchanged.

      If the Order vacating the original Payment Order is subsequently
      stayed or vacated, then the Recordkeepor shall stay or vacate
      the reversing Order required by this Rule.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1713 be amended to read:

      An Overdue Payment Order is a Payment Order which is presently
      effective, has been effective for more than seven days, and has
      not been satisfied.

      The Executor of an entity for which, at the beginning of a given
      Nomic week, there is at least one Overdue Payment Order naming
      it as Payor commits the Infraction of Persistent Indebtedness at
      the beginning of that Week.  If an entity has more than one
      Overdue Payment Order naming it as payor, its Executor commits
      as many such Infractions are there are different Currencies
      named in all these Overdue Payment Orders.

      The Recordkeepor of each Currency is authorized to report this
      Infraction with respect to the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor.  This Infraction carries a penalty of one Blot.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1442 be amended to read:

      The casting of any votes may only be achieved by the spending of
      VTs, as specified below.

      A Voting Entity Votes upon a Proposal when e, during the Voting
      Period of that Proposal, informs the Assessor of the Vote (or
      Votes) e is casting upon that Proposal.

      A Voting Entity may specify that e casts no Votes on a Proposal,
      and doing so cancels any previously Votes cast on that Proposal
      (if done during the Voting Period of that Proposal).

      At the end of the Voting Period of a given Proposal, the
      Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity a number of VTs equal to
      the cost of the Votes cast on that Proposal by that entity.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      An entity for which, at the beginning of a given Nomic week,
      there is at least one Overdue Payment Order naming it as Payor
      which was executed originally for the purpose of paying for
      Voting upon Proposals commits the Infraction of Debt Voting.
      This Infraction shall be reported by the Recordkeepor for Voting
      Tokens, and shall bear the penalty of the denial of Voting
      Privileges for a period of two weeks.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1696 be amended, by replacing the
characters "Assessor" with "Banker" throughout, and by inserting the
following paragraph at the beginning of the Rule:

      There shall exist the Office of Banker.  The Banker shall
      receive a weekly salary equal to 1.5 times the Basic Officer
      Salary.

Be it further resolved, that Rules 663, 1571, and 1573 be repealed.
[Judicial Orders cover everything that Injunctions cover.]

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      An Order is satisfied when the action which it requires to be
      performed is performed by the entity it requires to perform it.
      (Only Orders which require an entity to perform an action can be
      satisfied.)  Any entity who is required by an Order to perform
      an act who fails to perform the required action prior to the
      time specified in the Order commits the Crime of Contempt by
      Inaction, a Class C Crime.

      Except when otherwise specified, a single action can result in
      the satisifaction of at most one Order.  If an action would
      satisfy more than one Order, and no other specification is made,
      the Action satisfies the oldest Order which it would satisfy.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      Any entity who, while required by an Order to refrain from
      performing an action, performs the proscribed action while the
      Order is in effect commits the Crime of Contempt by Action, a
      Class C Crime.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1551 be amended, by replacing
"Injunction" with "Order".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 789 be amended to read:

      The Judge of any CFJ, the Statement of which alleges that a Rule
      should be interpreted in a certain way, which is judged TRUE,
      may, at eir discretion, issue an Order requiring the Rulekeepor
      to annotate the Rule in question with the Statement of that CFJ.
      Such an annotation, while it exists, shall guide application of
      that Rule.  

      The Rulekeepor may remove such an annotation only if that Rule
      is repealed, or when required to do so by a valid Order.
      Annotations to a Rule may not be modified in any way except as
      specified in this Rule.

      If a Player believes that an annotation is no longer pertinent,
      e may file, in the original CFJ from which the Order of
      Annotation arises, a Motion to Vacate the Order of Annotation.
      If such a Motion is granted, the Judge granting it shall Order
      the original Order Vacated and shall Order the Rulekeepor to
      remove the annotation in question.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1500 be amended to read:

      The Judge of any CFJ, the Statement of which alleges that an SLC
      should be interpreted in a certain way, which is judged TRUE,
      may, at eir discretion, issue an Order requiring the Maintainer
      of that SLC to annotate the SLC in question with the Statement
      of that CFJ.  Such an annotation, while it exists, shall guide
      application of that SLC.  

      The Maintainer of that SLC may remove such an annotation only
      when the SLC ceases to exist, or when required to do so by a
      valid Order.  Annotations to an SLC may not be modified in any
      way except as specified in this Rule.

      If a Player believes that an annotation is no longer pertinent,
      e may file, in the original CFJ from which the Order of
      Annotation arises, a Motion to Vacate the Order of Annotation.
      If such a Motion is granted, the Judge granting it shall Order
      the original Order Vacated and shall Order the Maintainer of
      that SLC to remove the annotation in question.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1742 be amended by replacing the
word "Injunctions" with "Orders".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 908 be amended to read:

      Upon a judicial finding that a Player (herein called the Ninny)
      has acted or has failed to act in such a way as to be in
      violation of one or more Rules, the Judge so finding shall Order
      that Player to submit, within 72 hours, a Formal Apology.
      However, when the action (or failure to act) is subject to
      penalties by virtue of being defined to be a Crime or an
      Infraction, the Order is optional and may be issued at the
      Judge's discretion.

      A Formal Apology shall consist of a letter of at least 200
      words, to be published by the Ninny in the Public Forum,
      explaining the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
      for self-improvement.

      The Judge issuing such an Order may, at eir discretion, include
      in eir Order a list of up to ten Prescribed Words (to be chosen
      by the Judge) which must be included in the Formal Apology.  If
      the Judge elects to include Prescribed Words, all of the Words
      required must appear within the Formal Apology. 

      The failure to abide by an Order of a sort specified by this
      Rule is an Infraction carrying a penalty of 3 Blots, to be
      reported by the Judge who issued the original Order. 

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1681 be amended, by replacing
"Injunction" with "Order".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1564 be amended to read:

      The Judgement entered in any CFJ by its Judge, the grant or
      denial of any Judicial Motion, and the execution of any Judicial
      Order are all subject to review on appeal to a Board of Appeal.
      
      In all cases, the insistence of any three Players, posted in the
      Public Forum, is sufficient to initiate the appeal of a
      particular matter.  In the case of the appeal of a Judicial
      Order, the insistence of any Player bound by the Order is
      sufficient.  In the case of a Judgement which convicts a Player
      of a Crime, the insistence of the convicted Player is
      sufficient.

      In each cases before a Board of Appeal, it shall collectively
      decide whether to affirm or to reverse the matter under appeal,
      and shall execute whatever Appellate Orders are necessary to
      enforce its determination.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1695 be amended to read:

      In the appeal of a Judicial Order, the Board shall consider
      whether the Order in question was both legally made and
      appropriate for the situation.

      If the Board finds that the Order was made legally, and was
      appropriate for the situation, it shall affirm the Order.  If an
      Order staying the execution of the appealed Order was entered,
      it shall vacate this stay.

      If the Board finds that the Order was made illegally, or that it
      was inappropriate for the situation, it shall vacate the
      original Order.  Should the Board further find that the Order
      was made without reasonable justification or for a clearly
      improper purpose, it shall (at its discretion) impose a penalty
      of 2 Blots upon the Judge who made the original Order.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1725 be repealed.  [If a Player
feels that a Judge has omitted an Order, e may file a Motion
requesting that that Order be issued, and may appeal the refusal of
that Motion, if refused.]

It seems to me that this should fall under the domain of the Omnibus 
Reform Act. (Which I just read, for the first time. Whew.) Anyway, I'm
not going to propose it. If anyone cares, they can do the job later on.
I'm going to make a few final touches to the new proposal system, and
then propose it, and let the chips fall where they may.

It was; I felt that Trustees were having enough problems as it was
that I should not make it harder on them, so I preferred to point
out possible objections and let each follow eir own conscience.

Only if the Judge is absolutely determined to answer Blob's generalized
question.  If e is determined only to determine the truth or falsity of
the statement's CFJ, then e need only find a single counterexample (assuming
that there is one).

I am assigning Trustees by arbitrary choice.  As Chuck has demonstrated, any
unwilling Trustee can avoid duty easily and without penalty by resigning.

OTOH, we've also long wished that there was a process similar to the
Judicial for answering general questions of interpretation.

If you can find a loophole that gives you one win is this not enough?
The big problem with multiple wins is that it is enormously
destabilising to the game's currency system.  At 10 VTs for each win,
lots of wins in a row will give someone far too much money.

Sorry.  Stated.  I joined on 2 Jan 98. The vote was not ended until 8
Jan 98, and was not reported as passed until 9 Jan 98. It would have
been a bit of fun in the courts.

Just out of interest, when is a rule change effective from ?

Thanx

Actually, it is valid and effective unless someone makes an objection
within one week, which has just expired.  No matter what other plans for
Calabresi you may have announced since then

The objection made by Zefram was the subject of CFJ 1079, which found the
objection to lack foundation.  According to Rule 1738, you may now proceed
to implement the original plan as if no objection had been made.

      from rule 1738:    "If a CFJ finds that an objection lacks
      foundation, then the Trustee may proceed as if that objection
      had never been made, and any attempt to announce that same
      objection again is not legally made."

I appreciate your idea of using the R-O-M to make new scams
possible. But I guess this very possibility is why most people will
vote against ROM-proposals that repeal anything that isn't obviously
useless. 

And repealing such useless white elephants (as zefram called them)
was, IIRC, the intention of the ROM in the first place. In any case,
that's the goal I have in mind when I decide to vote for or against
ROM proposals.

Because this patch (of course it need a rule change!) is something I
think I could write in a few minutes; on the other hand, I don't feel
like going through the whole probate code and repair it
systematically.

Morendil has a Proto to define "Terminal" already, I see.  In addition,
point (d) in Rule 1738 should be deleted - it should not be there for
non-Terminal Entities and is redundant with point (a) for Terminal ones.

Rule Changes pursuant to an adopted Proposal are effective upon the
first correct report by the Assessor that the Proposal has been
adopted (even if that Report misreports the number of votes FOR and

Yes.  And any entity presently in Probate which should not be can be
removed from Probate simply by its Trustee formulating a do-nothing
plan and subsequently implementing it; this will fulfill Rule 1757's
exit clause.

shall be considered terminal if the entity is not currently registered as a
Player.".

Upon the adoption of this Proposal, all entities listed in the most recent

Is one win enough for anybody?  Wouldn't the people who care about wins like
more than one?  I got a great deal of pleasure from the multiple wins that were
a side effect of my scam, quite aside from the amount of VTs I received.  I
don't like to see others deprived of the possibility of that pleasure.  If
Players don't like the possible currency windfall and the "destabilization"
this might cause, then either reduce the awards for wins or continue, as we
have, to wipe out the effects of such windfalls with other proposals.

I think you are right.  However, since this Rule didn't get selected, I think
the existing policy allows us to let the current selections stand.  After all,
if I had missed a Rule, I would simply select a number with only 1/291 chance
of changing the selections, which would change each selections effective
probability to 1/291.  But since I had an extra Rule, the only time I would
have to make a re-selection is if that Rule had been selected.  This gives each
remaining Rule an effective probability of 1/289 - the correct probability, as
well.

However, I promise to be more careful about the announcement of voting results

Yes, I like this solution much better.  Although note that the repeal of 1697
has already been submitted by the R-O-M.  (Not that it would matter if both of
these were proposed.)

Of course, the original loophole of which I took advantage has never been
closed.  I still think we should add the requirement that 0-0-0 does not count
towards a Win by Proposal in R1663.  Maybe I should go ahead an propose that
too, unless you want to add it to your proto, Oerjan.

Based on the recent discussion, I am going to treat these statements as
impersonations of Payment Orders rather than actual POs, since, apparently, the
Rules did not grant Chuck the authority to issue them.  This includes
Harlequin, who was never required to publish the information subject to this
COE.

If someone thinks this is incorrect, please send me a good argument against it
or issue a CFJ.  Of course, if I don't buy your argument, you may still have to
issue a CFJ.  8)

Hooray!  Yes, I'd vote for a non-currency Point system.  Your version is
quite pragmatic.

At first I didn't like the idea of freezing everybody's score for a week at
the end of a game, but I see now that the Score Change Orders would still
be generated, and the points for voting, Proposals, etc. would still be
awarded after the week was finished.

I like it!

I have no problem with two, as the Rules currently allow.  But I
don't think a Player should earn a Plutonium Cup (or whatever the
highest Cup is) from a single scam.

The following is my intended Judgement (not an actual submission of a 
Judgement to the CotC) in 1080, any comments welcomed.

>   "If the rules require that a player has to perform an action at a
>    particular time, or during a particular time period, and e fails to
>    do so, then e is not required to perform the action at a later time."

This is a broad (some might say overbroad) statement about the Rules.
As such it should be Judged TRUE if it is true in all instances to
which it can possibly apply, and FALSE if there are some instances
in which it doesn't.

As a general observation, I would like to note that my understanding
of the term "requirement" implies that, short of the Rules explicitly
absolving a Player of a given requirement, as do Rules 1584
(Absolvement of Duty for On Hold Players) and 1585 (Official Duties
upon Officer Change), the only way that a Rule-mandated requirement
can cease to apply is for the action required to be performed, or the
Rule or Rules involved to be amended such that they no longer
require that particular action.

However, if there remains a doubt, I contend that we can easily find
instances of Rule-mandated requirements for which the above
Statement fails to apply. (In fact, I am convinced that the sort of
requirement to which the Statement could apply is a rarity, the 
exception rather than the rule, if indeed there exit any such.)

In particular, if we can find some Rule or class of Rules such that a
Player who is required to perform an action at a particular time or
during a particular time period, and fails to do so, afterward
remains required to perform that particular action, then the above
Statement is FALSE. 

An almost ideal example is actions required "as soon as possible"; of 
these, Rule 1023 explicitly states that 

      This Rule does not deprive actions which do not conform to its
      requirements of whatever effects they would otherwise have.

Thus, in the case of ASAP actions, failure to perform within the
time period specified does not otherwise alter the significance of
performing such an action at a later time.

In particular, performing the action after the ASAP-imposed time
limit has expired will therefore fulfill the requirement for that
action to be performed. I argue that if performing a given action 
fulfills a requirement for that action to be performed, then that 
action was required up to that point.

I therefore find the statement to be FALSE.

I would like to note, however, that of the two classes of
requirements mentioned by the Caller, the first one raises a genuine
problem, and this Judge's task would have been much harder had the 
Statement been limited to that first class, to wit, requirements to 
perform an action *at* a specified, absolute time.

For instance, Rule 1007 states : "At the beginning of each Nomic
Week, the Registrar shall pay out to each Officer the designated
Salary for each Office that Officer has held without interruption
for the entire five days preceding."

Such a requirement is arguably impossible to fulfill, given our
definition of "the beginning of the Nomic Week". On the other hand,
Game Custom strongly suggests that clauses similar to this one should
be interpreted as specifying the time at which a requirement begins 
to be incurred.

I think the Judgement itself is probably right, but I believe
your particular example is flawed:

*If* the requirement is still in effect.  That is the central question
here, and you do not address it in regard to this example.

>I argue that if performing a given action 
>fulfills a requirement for that action to be performed, then that 
>action was required up to that point.

Circular reasoning.  "Performing an ASAP action after 7 days fulfills
a requirement, because a requirement exists.  A requirement must
exist in regards to an ASAP action even after 7 days, because it
is possible to fulfill that requirement."

Sure, there's no question of TIA. Is it against the Rules to execute
a Payment Order without proper authority? Or are these merely attempted
executions without legal effect?

I think I do. The argument goes that the language in 1023 does
nothing to absolve the Player who failed to perform the required
action of said requirement, and indeed explicitly states that aside
from having the effect that not performing that action within its
time constraints will result in the commission of the Infraction of
Tardiness, nothing else regarding that action is changed as a result
of the application Rule.

> Circular reasoning.  "Performing an ASAP action after 7 days fulfills

> is possible to fulfill that requirement."

So, given the above, it's more like "Performing an ASAP action after
7 days fulfills the requirement which existed prior to Rule 1023
being applied to limit the time during which the action could be
performed without incurring a penalty. Such a requirement still
exists with regard to an ASAP action after 7 days because Rule 1023
explicitly states that it has no other effect with regard to the
relevant action other than to cause an Infraction penalty to be
incurred." 

OK, yours sounds better. ;)

Seriously though, maybe I should drop this example altogether, I 
agree that it's not as enlightening as I thought, and keep only the 
main point that if the Rules impose a requirement, the only two ways 
in which that requirement no longer holds is if a Player has been 
absolved of it by the Rules or has fulfilled it ?

I wish Blob had just CFJed on the interpretation of R1023. That at least
would have been a question a Judge could tackle, and would have settled
an important point concerning a large number of the obligations imposed
on Players by the Rules.

This question implies an excluded middle which is not present.  It is
entirely possible that an Payment Order executed without "proper
authority" is nonetheless a Payment Order, with legal effect.

True. And, now that I think about, the way we've been interpreting R1023
probably provides plenty of counter-examples.

Not if the Player organizing the scam has eir wits about them. Time

Actually, that's not the impression I had concerning the motivation
for the ROM. I thought that its use of the Proposal mechanism was
a response to criticisms of the Virus and the FM that their changes
happened automatically.

I think this is one of the best examples of R116 in action.  R116 allows
Players to post anything they want to the PF.  However, any post to the PF only
has whatever legal (or illegal) significance that the Rules grant it.  So
Chuck's attempts at issuing POs were not illegal (no Rule defines them as
illegal) but the Rules also do not grant them any legal significance as real
POs.

It depends on whether the concept of 'proper authority' is treated
platonically or pragmatically in the Rules. If the concept is
platonic, then a PO executed without proper authority has no legal
effects (although attempting such an execution may be punishable); if
pragmatic, then such a PO may well be effective, and we should expect
stiff penalties to be imposed on those who execute POs without proper
authority.

Having said that, I'd gathered the impression from a previous
discussion that 'proper authority' was at present a platonic
concept. If that's right, then my way of dividing the possibilities
is appropriate.

If 'proper authority' were pragmatized, then it would turn out that
Chuck's actions were illegal, in the sense of 'punishable as a violation
of the Rules', while at the same time they would retain significance
as Payment Orders. There are pros and cons to this kind of approach
to authority. The major advantage would be that anything that looks a
PO almost certainly is one (although of course you'd be able to dispute
it); the major disadvantage would be that we'd need to introduce pretty
stiff penalties to discourage fraud. Almost certainly there would be
opportunities for major scams before the system was bedded down.

Not a bad idea, although we've managed for 4.5 years without them.
There is nothing in the proto, however, which states how a Holiday
is declared.

But 1023 is one of the less contraversial parts of the problem. 
ASAP requirements are relatively easy to interpret. It's those corners
of the ruleset which ASAP never reached that trouble me.

I'm not in the habit of searching in the light for something lost in 
the dark, even if it does make searching easier.

If the rules require a player do do something at a certain time, or
during a certain period, can the player possibly fulfil the requirement
at another time? Isn't the time frame a part of the requirement?

If the rules say "Clap your hands on Monday Jan 19 1998." and I clap
my hands on Tuesday instead, have I fulfilled the requirement? I'd 
say not. Maybe the requirement lingers, but the possibility of my 
ever fulfulling it is past. [Unless Time Agent is willing to let me
borrow his time machine. :)]

I'd also argue that talking about ASAP is a red herring, because the
rules explicitly avoid putting a fixed time-frame on such requirements.

This is slightly unclear. Probably best to be explicit and say "If a
COE on the Scorekeepor's announcement does allege an error which
affects a Player's eligibility to Win, and the Scorekeepor admits the
error..."

I have a procedural question. What if the COE is to the effect that
Player B is also eligible to Win, in addition to Player A, whom the
Scorekeepor has already reported as being eligible? Does the proto
handle this case gracefully?

You need to rewrite this to leave room for the possibility of Appeals.

I have a problem with the last sentence of the first paragrpah: "Such
bodies of law are part of the law of this Nomic, to the extent that they
do not conflict with the Rules." This implies, for instance, that to
the extent that an SLC conflicts with the Rules, it is not a part of
the body of the law of this Nomic. This seems to me to conflate the idea
of being part of a body of law with the idea of being a legally effective
part of that body.

It seemed to me that Proposal was assuming as a matter of metaphysics
rather than of law that changes to game state (probably better to say
'changes to Nomic Properties') occur only as the result of Player actions.

Making it true as a matter of law is an interesting project, I agree.

I think we need to think extremely carefully about what the consequences
of that would be before we adopt it, since they could be very far reaching.
It would be total pragmatization of the game, at a single stroke, and would
likely bring R1011 into conflict with any Rule still employing platonic
concepts. Nevertheless, here's a proto:

####
Proto-Proposal
Changing Nomic Properties

This Proposal has an Adoption Index of 2.

Be it hereby resolved that R1011 be amended by replacing the text in it
which currently reads:

      No Nomic Property shall be changed except in accordance with
      procedures specified by the Rules.

with text which reads:

      No Nomic Property shall be changed be changed except as the
      result of actions taken by persons in accordance with the Rules.

####

Note that we have to say 'persons' and not 'Players'; otherwise,
registration might be illegal. Non-player CFJs certainly would be.

The Omnibus Reform pragmatizes authority.  There definitely is scam
potential: the Justices in a given case could conspire to issue an
improper order, an act for which there is no appeal (except to ask the
Justices to reconsider their decision).  Since all other orders can be
appealed, I suspect that it will only be necessary to limit Appellate
Orders to have binding authority only over the Judge of the case below
and the Clerk of the Courts in eir official capacity.

You are again conflating what I believe to be two very different
classes of requirements, with, again in my opinion, two very
different answers to the question.

I would essentially agree, I think, and it is my opinion that a CFJ
raising the issue would be interesting, although we have
overwhelming Game Custom to the effect that it is meaningful for the
Rules to require e.g. an action to be performed *at* the beginning of
the Nomic Week, illogical as it may seem if we adopt a literal
interpretation.

If we follow Game Custom, then all Players who have been required to 
perform an action *at* a NW boundary did indeed violate the Rules, 
because they invariably did it somewhat later, but we chose not to 
bring them to the Courts for it. I would say that this gives "at the 
beginning of the NW" a meaning aking to "in a timely fashion", that 
is, there is an implied requirement to perform within a finite (and 
limited, on the order of one week) period, but this period is 
customary rather than rigidly specified.

> I'd also argue that talking about ASAP is a red herring, because the
> rules explicitly avoid putting a fixed time-frame on such requirements.

I thought 'within a week' was a pretty fixed time frame. And in this
case, the argument I make in my CFJ holds : the ASAP rule makes it
clear that not performing an action which is required ASAP will
result in the delinquent Player incurring a penalty, but that
otherwise the nature of the coercion imposed by the Rules and the
eventual effects of the action are not altered. 

Now, is there a general answer to the question of how it is that a
requirement to clap your hands on Monday remains in force, and can
be fulfilled, the following Tuesday ? I think there is, and it is to 
be found in a common sense interpretation of "required". I am 
required by law to pay taxes by a certain date, and incur a 10% 
penalty otherwise. I wouldn't even dream of turning up at the local 
collection office to say that, the date being past, I was no longer 
required to pay the taxes...

No, I didn't define any Holidays originally.  This is mechanism, not

I'm sorry, what are the two classes?

I am willing to agree with a loose definition of "at" in this case,
but there are other cases which are not so loose. When a player is
required to do something once a week, once the week has passed, the
requirement is impossible to fulfill.

As I have argued in an email I just posted, I think R1023 sets up two
obligations on a player - one to act within a week, and one to act "as
soon as possible" in the standard interpretation of the phrase. This
second obligation has an indefinite time frame.

I think that here there are also two requirements in action. One is 
the requirement to pay your taxes by the due date, the other is the 
requirement to pay your taxes, without any set time frame. When the due
date is past, you can no longer fulfill the first requirement, but you
can (and should) still fulfill the second.

individually to get rid of the shoddy language.

I see that I have not made myself very clear on this issue of rule 
requirements and time. I admit that I probably should have got my ideas
straight in my head before CFJing. Oh well, you can't change the past.

Let me see if I can explain things more clearly.

Imagine there is a rule that says, "Blob must clap eir hands on Wed 21
Jan 1998." Now, this rule places an obligation on me, which, as Morendil
says, won't go away until I fulfil it, or the rule is repealed.

But what is the exact nature of this obligation. Is it not that I must
clap my hands _today_? If I fail to clap my hands today, then I have
undoubtably violated the rule. What happens to the obligation?

Following Morendil's argument, it has neither been repealed or fulfilled,
so it must remain. Tomorrow I will still be under an obligation to clap
my hands on Wed 21 Jan 1998. But this obligation will be impossible to
fulfill. No amount of clapping tomorrow will change the fact that I did
not clap today. You can't change the past, as I said above.

Now, to bring this closer to the ruleset, what if the rule said "Blob
must clap eir hands [do blobs have hands?] every day." Once again, I
forget to clap my hands today. Once again, I have violated the rule.
I can clap my hands twice tomorrow, but this does not change the fact
that I did not clap them today, and hence did not clap them every day.
What is more, I see no reason to believe that this rule would require
me to clap twice tomorrow. 

Finally, consider the rule "Blob must clap eir hands as soon as possible 
after Wed 21 Jan 1998." Now this, in isolation, is quite a different
kettle of fish. I would argue that the time period is now open ended.
If I do not clap today, then I am still under an obligation to clap
as soon as possible. So clapping tomorrow is a way of fulfilling the
obligation. Even if I fail to clap for fifty years, as long as the
rule remains, I am still under the obligation to clap as soon as
possible.

R1023 confuses the issue a bit, because it places an explicit 1 week
time limit on ASAP requirements. I'm kind of uncertain about what this
means, because the rule seems to want to have its cake and eat it too.
It seems to claim both that the requirement has a specific time-frame,
and that this time-frame is not part of the requirement, but is only
for the purposes of applying penalties. 

I think that the best interpretation of this rule, and possibly the
one best fitting game custom, is that there are actually two 
requirements placed on a player by a rule such as "Blob must clap eir
hands as soon as possible after Wed 21 Jan 1998." One is created by 
the rule itself, and is open ended, as described above. The other is
created by R1023, and says, in effect, "Blob must clap eir hands
within 1 week of Wed 21 Jan 1998." Now if I do not clap my hands 
before next Wednesday, then after that point I am still able to fulfil
the first of these two requirements, but never the second.

Does this all make sense? Would anyone argue that the requirement to
clap my hands today can, or should, be fulfilled by clapping tomorrow?
I think that we have been interpreting the rules in that way in the
past, and I cannot see why.

Actions required *at* a particular time, for one, and actions 
required *within* some period of time, for the other.

Then again this is a third category, one not covered by the CFJ I am
considering. And a good thing too. ;)

The same reasoning as the tax situation holds, though. If I am
required by law to brush my teeth every day, then failing to do so on 
one particular day might result in a sanction but would presumably 
not absolve me of the requirement to do so on all other days.

Might be one way of looking at it. I'll ponder that...

Hsm. Is that one requirement, or many? I would regard it as placing
