Not yet.  First, instead of generating new Payment Orders (which you ought
to vacate now), you should submit Transfer Orders to satisfy the old POs;
see Rule 1757.  Second, you need to send your announcements to the Public
Forum (agora-business most likely); see Rule 478.

In processing this, I noticed that Blob had amended VT751 to be a
debt for 2 VTs, not 3.  This portion of the transfer failed, since a
3 VT transfer is unable to satisfy VT751.

Haven't I already done that? I checked the Herald's report, for example, and
all of macross's POs have been satisfied.

Technically, Murphy is correct.  However, it was clear from the context, as well
as from the message that Elysion issued immediately afterward, that "payment
order" in the original message was a typo.

Since it is impossible for a PO to satisfy a PO, I found it reasonable to
treat this as a typographical error, the true meaning of which was
unambiguous, and let it fall under R754.  Admittedly, p-a-y-m-e-n-t
is a rather egregious misspelling of t-r-a-n-s-f-e-r.  8)

May I remind everyone (except Kolja) that they have a Duty to Vote on
the current Batch of proroposals.

May I also express my regret at only distributing my own proposal this
week. I admit it was an opportunistic move, and I should at least have 
used my Promotor's Privilege to get either Oerjan's or Vlad's proposal
distributed at the same time.

(Nevertheless, to re-ignite an old debate, this does show why I favour
monthly salaries - they create interesting "seasons" in our voting
system.)

BTW: Am I the only one wondering, how Crito managed to collect quite 
so many VTs?
