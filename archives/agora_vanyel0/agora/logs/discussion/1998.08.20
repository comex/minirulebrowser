I disagree that precedence and deference are converse relations,
logical mirrors of each other, as you put it.  To defer to something
is to make no claims affecting others, it is merely to affect one's
own behaviour, over which one presumably has control.  To claim
precedence requires others to defer, but is not something that can be
done with an automatic guarantee of success.

Thus R1023 is surely allowed to state as part of its text (and this is
a paraphrase of what I believe it says):

"If another rule states that something is to be done before a week has
 passed, then that rule's determination of the time limit is correct."

Reading this sentence, we want to determine how long the hapless
Officer has to report.  R1023 says that they have a week, but (and
this is still the Power=2 text of R1023 remember) that if another rule
says otherwise, then R1023 agrees with that rule.    It seems to me
that the whole transaction is taking place at Power=2.  

Aren't the effects of rule texts allowed to be conditional on the
contents of other rules? 

Would you agree that if the relevant sentence ("Other Rules may impose
earlier latest times, and if so, this Rule defers to them.") of R1023
were replaced by my paraphrase, then the effect would be as I claimed
it? 

If so, why do you think that the paraphrase is inaccurate?

I hold that conflict exists between two rules if the two rules can not
be read on their own in a consistent manner.  If Rule A says "P", and
B says "not P", then there is a conflict because they do not admit the
possibility of yielding to each other.  In this case, our rules step
in and resolve the conflict in favour of the rule with the higher
Power, or the lower number if they have the same Power.

On the other hand, if A says "P, unless B says otherwise", and B says
"not P", then I would claim that there isn't a conflict, because these
two rules can be seen to be consistent without the interference of any
external machinery.

Our various conflict resolution mechanisms surely don't need to be
invoked in situations where the rules supposedly in conflict actually
agree with each other.

Michael.

What is your definition of conflict then?  It seems to me that if it's
logically possible for a Player to obey both rules, then they are
hardly in conflict. 

How do you characterise conflict such that Jeff's are in conflict but
the two following are not?

A: Officers must report once a week.
B: Group Ordinancekeepors must provide their Group's Ordinances to any
   Player on request.

Michael.

Except that it then goes and defers to those rules which impose an
earlier time.  My argument is that this doesn't introduce a conflict.

I agree with Michael in this regard.  While there is an aesthetic
cleanness in trying to treat claims of precedence and of deference in
complementary fashion, this does not correspond to the manner in which
such statements are actually used in practice.  Michael's point, that
a claim of deference always succeeds (although you get a rather odd
situation in cases of mutual deference, admittedly), but a claim of
precedence may not, is highly relevant.

I also agree with Michael that there is no conflict when the rules in
question are written so as to avoid it.

DIS: Ratification WO is broken

Hmm.  Is Ratification Without Objection an instrument?  I tend to think it is
not - it is merely a procedure defined by the Rules.  If this is true, then I
don't think there is a conflict, just two Rules specifying different ways in
which an Official Document may be ratified.  Note R1550 does not say "must be
ratified...".

I worried about this when I first saw it, and now I think I see why.
Look at R1550:

      Any Official Document (as specified in other Rules) may be
      ratified by the operation of an adopted Proposal (but no other
      sort of instrument).  The instrument must specify an Official
      Document (as specified in other Rules) which is subject to
      ratification.

It's true that R1791 say that:

      Any Officer who holds an Office in Normal Fashion can Ratify an
      Official Report Without Objection, provided the following
      conditions hold;

But that just brings R1791 into conflict with R1550, a conflict which
it loses. Ratification Without Object is therefore broken. I believe
that Swann proposed to fix it recently, but this was one of the worthy
Proposals which failed Quorum during the ban on Presence.

I didn't mean to imply that you had. The 'we' referred only to Jeff and

You have a point there. R1688 defines an instrument as "any entity with
Power greater than zero", which Ratification Without Objection is not.

And my argument is that R1030 forces us to assume that a conflict
exists, before a deference clause can be invoked to resolve it.

Your parenthetical qualification gives the game away. Indeed, deference
claims do *not* automatically succeed - mutual deference clauses (in
Rules of equal Power) result in the conflict being resolved by lower
Number. But why should we think that this case is any odder, or indeed
any different, to the case of mutual precedence claims? Especially when
R1030 treats them in *exactly* the same way! R1030 doesn't explicitly
state the Mirror Image Assumption, but it certainly treats precedence
and deference claims as though they were mirror images of each other.

>I also agree with Michael that there is no conflict when the rules in

I have no quarrel with either of you on that point. I only claim that
you can't avoid conflict by using a deference clause, since the way the
Rules talk about deference clauses makes it clear that they only get
invoked when a conflict already exists. If you want to avoid conflicts,
you have to use some other construction (eg "unless another Rules says
otherwise").

This is not quite true. If A claims precedence over B, it does so with 
the power and precedence of A. If B defers to A, it does so with the
power and precedence of B. Thus there could be situations where the
two and not the same.

It appears that the DNS name change has begun earlier than expected.
There may be some difficulties while the name change propagates. My
local name server appears to have picked up the change now.
