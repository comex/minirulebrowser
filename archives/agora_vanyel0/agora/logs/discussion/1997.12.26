Proposals take effect when the Promotor announces their passage, not when
the VP ends.  Rule 1753 took effect on Dec. 9.

I believe this is in error.  All five Proposals should be
distributed, and the Executor of the Repeal-O-Matic should be charged
with three counts of Executive Misconduct.

I am not entirely certain this fulfills Rule 1478's requirements that
when "a Player is acting on behalf of some entity of which e is the
Executor other than emself, e must make it clear that e is doing so".
With the exception of "it's time to discharge my duties as Promotor
wrt to the Repeal-O-Matic", I find no indication that Crito was 
acting as the ROM's Executor in this post.

I am satisfied that it was clear that he was acting as the Executor of

I am slightly perplexed that you should say so, given your position
on underspecification in Player posts... How did Crito make that
clear to you, then ?

The above observation is mainly due to the fact that, not having had
the time yet to fully examine the new Rules pertaining to the
Repeal-O-Matic, I was still unaware that the ROM was a Proposing
Entity with the Promotor as its Executor; and Crito's post did not do
anything to correct that ignorance, but rather your own message to
a-d about Executor Misconduct or somesuch.

The posting clearly indicated that the six proposals were submitted by the
Repeal-O-Matic for six different weeks, not for one week.  It is my impression
that we have well established game custom allowing this kind of "catch-up" to
recover from crises.  If you will insist on interpreting this as six proposals
for one week rather than one proposal for each of the six preceeding weeks,
then resolution of further crises may become more difficult than they already
are.  In any case, since this was done in the spirit of restoring things to the
correct game state, I think that any such prosecution for Executive Misconduct
(whatever that is - I couldn't find it in the Rules) would only be
mean-spirited.

However, I am going to use my own interpretation that this represented six
separate attempts for six separate weeks, and that the first four were
unsuccessful since there actually was no Repeal-O-Matic in effect at the
appropriate times.

I was not acting as the ROM's Executor in that post.  Here is a quote from the
Repeal-O-Matic Rule.

      For the purpose of the Rules governing Proposals, it shall be
      deemed that The Repeal-O-Matic Rule has submitted its Proposal
      concerning a given Rule immediately after the Promotor makes the
      selection of that Rule.

The proposals were submitted when I made the selections, not when I sent the
results to the PF.  If you read the entire Rule, you will find nothing that
requires the Promotor to publish the results of eir selections prior to
distributing the proposals.  I only did so to give other Players an opportunity
to pay proposal fees for the Repeal-O-Matic proposals, if they so desire.  I
will continue to do this in the future.
