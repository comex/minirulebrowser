No, I don't wish we were Ackanomic, but I do wish we had an Agoran
history along the lines of what is available at:
  http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/acka/history.html

Who wants to write it?  There are logs for most of the game
available I suspect.

I would interpret "hereby" as implying that the events occur at that point
in the message, which in this case means that Scott minted the VTs _after_
making the Transfers.  However, due to the last paragraph of Rule 1598,
this may not really matter.

> To Oerjan,               36.0 VTs (mandated by Rule 1754)

I wish to state that I have no intention of using these VTs for personal
gain, and that I wish to use them to fund some sort of charitable Contest. 
Exactly what, I haven't decided yet.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

Yes, on the 27th - and it did report Andre's deregistration.

Digging through some *old* protos (more than two years old!), I found
this. I changed only the date of the self-repeal.

####
Proto-Proposal
Amend Me If You Can

Be it therefore resolved that the following Rule, entitled "Amend Me
If You Can", be Created with MI=4:

      This Rule shall not be changed, that is, amended, repealed,
      Mutated, or subject to any other Rule Change of a kind defined
      by the Rules, under any circumstances, except as specifically
      provided for in this Rule. Such changes shall, for the purposes
      of this Rule, be taken specifically to include changes in the
      Number and/or Title of this Rule. This Rule takes precedence
      over any Rule which would permit such a change to take place.

      Furthermore, no Rule shall have any effects which has a higher
      Mutability Index than this Rule, and this Rule takes precedence
      over any Rule which would permit such a Rule to have any effects.

      This Rule explicitly claims the right to determine its
      precedence relations to other Rules according to its own
      provisions, and it takes precedence over any other Rules which
      seek to determine the precedence relations of this Rule in any
      other manner.

      Upon being Created, this Rule immediately and automatically
      renumbers itself. Its new Number is 100. Immediately after
      that, this paragraph automatically deletes itself.

      This Rule automatically Repeals itself on April 1, 1998.

Be it further resolved that the following Rule, entitled "The 'Amend Me
If You Can' Competition", be Created:

      The first Player to make a Proposal whose adoption results in 
      the Rule "Amend Me If You Can" being Amended, Repealed or
      Mutated, shall win the game.
