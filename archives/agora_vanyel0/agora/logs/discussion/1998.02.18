Protoproposal Chaos32 [rev. 2]

Capitalism, Ho!

[Note: This Protoproposal has not been substantially revised since
last July, and therefore is probably out of sync with the current
Rules in some areas.]

Title I: General Authorization

This Title establishes a general system by which Officers controls
fees, taxes, and commissions on certain actions.
      
1. Be it therefore resolved, that a Rule titled "Fees" be created with
the following text:
      
      The Rules may require that the payment of a fee be required for
      certain actions to have legal effect.  When an action is subject
      to such a restriction, the action so restricted has no legal
      effect until and unless the required fee is paid or waived
      An action which is subject to a non-zero fee does not take
      place, any other Rule notwithstanding, unless and until the fee
      is paid to the Officer who controls the fee for that action.

      Each fee has zero or more rates.  Each rate is specified as a
      fixed positive number of units of one Currency.  For each
      Currency, at most one of rates of a given fee may be specified
      in that Currency; if a fee has two or more rates specified in
      the same Currency, the least of all such rates prevails.  A rate
      which is not specified in the form of a positive number of units
      of exactly one Currency is not valid.  If no valid rates are
      specified for a fee, then that fee is zero.  Initially, every
      fee has no valid rate.

      A fee is paid when a Transfer Order is successfully executed for
      a number of units of a Currency matching one of its rates, from
      the entity attempting to perform that action, to the Officer
      controlling that fee, and for the purpose of paying that fee.

      Whenever the Rules require a Player to perform an action, and
      that action has a fee, that Player is permitted to, after paying
      the fee, execute a Payment Order from the Bank to emself for the
      amount of the fee.

      The execution of a Transfer Order for the purpose of paying a
      fee shall not be subject to any fee, tax, or commission of any
      sort, any other Rule notwithstanding.

      The Officer who controls a fee is authorized to add to it a new
      rate, and to increase one of its existing rates, Without
      Objection.  E may reduce or delete one of its existing rates
      simply by announcing the intended change in the Public Forum.

      The Chancellor shall maintain a schedule listing each fee, its
      rate(s), and the Office controlling it.  The Chancellor controls
      a fee for adding, deleting, or changing the rate of a fee.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Be it therefore resolved, that a Rule titled "Taxes" be created with
the following text:
      
      A "tax" is a surcharge on an action which does not need to be
      paid prior to the action having effect.  An action is subject to
      a tax only if the Rules specifically so state, and only if the
      Rules state which Officer controls that tax.

      Within one week of when an action for which there is a non-zero
      tax is performed, the Officer who controls the tax for that
      action is permitted to execute a Payment Order from the entity
      which performed that action to emself for an amount equal to the
      rate of that tax at the time the action was performed.  However,
      no Payment Order shall be executed if the entity who performed
      that action was the Officer controlling the commission.

      The rate of a tax shall be specified either as zero, or as a
      positive number of units of exactly one Currency.  The Officer
      who controls a tax is authorized to change its rate Without
      Objection, and may further change it to zero, or to a lesser
      number of the same Currency in which it is presently specified,
      simply by announcing the change in the Public Forum.

      The execution of a Transfer Order for the purpose of satisfying
      a Payment Order executed to collect a tax shall not be subject
      to any fee, tax, or commission of any sort, any other Rule
      notwithstanding.

      The Chancellor shall maintain a schedule listing each tax, its
      rate, and the Office controlling it.  The Chancellor controls a
      fee for changing the rate of a tax.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Be it therefore resolved, that a Rule titled "Commissions" be
created with the following text:
      
      A "commission" is a surcharge on certain types of Transfer Orders. 
      A Transfer Order is subject to a commission only if the Rules
      specifically so state, and only if the Rules state which Officer
      controls that commission.

      Within one week of when a Transfer Order for which there is a
      non-zero commission is successfully executed, the Officer who
      controls the commission for that Transfer Order is permitted to
      execute a Payment Order from the recipient of the original
      Transfer Order to emself for an amount equal to that
      commission's percentage (at the time the Transfer Order was
      executed) of the amount originally transferred, rounded down.
      However, no Payment Order shall be executed if the recipient of
      the original Transfer Order was the Officer controlling the
      commission, or if the amount of the resulting Payment Order
      would be zero.

      The rate of a commission shall be a percentage between 0% and
      100%, inclusive.  The Officer who controls a commission is
      authorized to increase its rate Without Objection, and may
      reduce it simply by announcing the change in the Public Forum.

      No commission shall apply to Transfer Orders made in order to
      satisfy a Payment Order executed to collect a commission, any
      Rule (including this one) notwithstanding.

      The Chancellor shall maintain a schedule listing each
      commission, its rate, and the Office controlling it.  The
      Chancellor controls a fee for changing the rate of a commission.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Title II: Specific Fees

This Title establishes a largish number of fees, so that most Officers
will be remunerated in proportion to the work they do.

1. Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1016 be amended by adding the

Hm, no.  The PO in question is not presently subject to a challenge.
Michael did in fact vacate the Order originally paying you 10 VTs.
Whether he should have done so is presently subject to dispute.
However, since that Order was satisfied before being vacated, I am
required (as Assessor) to issue a reversing Order.  The pending
litigation does not question the validity of that reversing Order.
(This may be considered a problem.)

I will admit that you have indeed received the shaft.

I thought everyone might like to know that I'm working
on a search engine for the Rules.  I hope to have it done
this week, but I can't make any promises.

Anyway, the reason I mention this is that I thought you
might like a taste of things to come.  The form for
searching and documentation are already online, and available
at:

http://www.dfw.net/~ccarroll/agora/rules/search.html

Please note: THE SEARCH ITSELF DOES NOT WORK YET.  I
am still writing the program.  If you enter a search
and hit the "Search" button all you will get is some
diagnostics I've set up to make sure that the portion of
the program I've written so far works like it should.

I'm mentioning this so that you can see the form and
documentation now, and let me know if you have any suggestions
or comments.  I can't make any promises that I'll incorporate
any suggestions, but now is the time to make them while I'm
still doing the programming.

You can always _make_ a good IN proposal (by sending it to me) - if it
passes in IN, you get a nice reward (5 VT, 1 P-note according to
1748).

One general remark : you need to add a mechanism for adding rates or
increasing fees by Proposal. Otherwise, one curmudgeonly Player
objecting to all WO postings of rate or fee changes can make the 
whole thing useless.

Doesn't Rule 594 provide adequate mechanism already?

I judged a SFJ (11?) on its behalf, but that's been it.  I really should
propose to have it start conducting internal votes on INPs.

The Proposal Queue made this kind of number skipping inevitable.
I can't say I like it much. Is there anyway to avoid it, say by
delaying the assignment of Numbers to Proposals in the Queue 
until after they have reached Priority 1?

My address was temporarily out of order this morning for some hours,
while the sysadmins attempted (unsuccessfully) a cluster installation.
If any mail you sent me bounced back to you, try again now; the problem
is fixed. For now.

DIS: Re: OFF:  New Proposals: 3695 - 3697, 3699

This would require an amendment to the Rules for any proposal that stayed in
the queue longer than one week at priority zero.  I would suggest assigning
queue numbers separately from proposal numbers, with the proposal number being
assigned at distribution time.  Should I work up a proto?

Well I was thinking more along the lines of Priority 0 Proposals simply
not having a number. Any reason why that wouldn't work?

And indeed his having received the shaft is only incidentally related
to 'Real VT scarcity, *now*'; he'd have been equally shafted if, having
received the 10 VTs, he'd merely spent them on voting. The problem
lies fundamentally in the way PC handles vacations of disputed POs.
Your suggestion that those who voted for RVSN should compensate 
Harlequin is therefore disingenuous: you're responsible for PC - 
why don't you compensate him? And, no, I'm not serious.

'Real VT scarcity, *now*' was accompanied by an explanation of the
philosophy behind it: that if we wish to explore the political dynamics
of scarcity, we have to be prepared to wipe the slate clean of the
mistakes of the past, by which I mean the oversupply of VTs. I freely
admit that I have been largely responsible for those mistakes. I've
been experimenting; it's hard to know in advance what will work and
what will not. There were also political aspects to consider; the 
idea of serious scarcity was not as popular in the period during
which I proposed 'Restore Game Balance' and 'RGBII'. I believe we
have Kolja to thank for its increased popularity; the day after
he registered he included among several astute observations a call
for real VT scarcity that provided a lot of impetus for what has
since transpired. Hats off to Kolja.

My question to you, Scott, is this: do you object to the philosophy
which motivated 'Real VT scarcity, *now*'? If so, I'm interested
in your reasons. I'd welcome a chance to debate the merits of this
policy.

Time Agent,

These messages should be sent to nomic-business. While the rules admit 
that both n-b and n-o are Public Fora, it is conventional around here to
reserve n-o for Official Reports only, and to conduct all other business
in n-b.

I raised this concern when I proto'd it, but no-one seemed to thing it
was a particular concern. Numbers are assigned when the proposal enters
the Queue so that there is an unambiguous way of referring to proposals 
in the Queue. They do not need to be the same as the Proposal numbers, 
but I didn't want to go to the extra complexity to have two sets of 
numbers.

Re: DIS: Re: OFF:  New Proposals: 3695 - 3697, 3699

If the queue gets large enough, recent proposals with priorities bumped up
ahead of others (to 2 or more) could also cause skipped or out of sequence
numbers in a distribution.

Well I was thinking more along the lines of Priority 0 Proposals simply
not having a number. Any reason why that wouldn't work?

This is interesting, no doubt about it, but I don't think I'd support
it any time soon. It would create an enormous amount of extra paperwork.
It would also introduce a completely different set of inputs and
outputs into the economy at a time when it's just about possible that
a year's tinkering with various things may be about to bear fruit. I
think we're close to getting VTs right (although I'm still worried
about Plots for more or less the same reasons as I give here), the
Proposal Queue looks a promising way to finally make P-Notes worth
something (although there are still too many in circulation), and
there's plenty of demand for Indulgences. I don't want to have to
start nearly from scratch with a completely new system when we're
just getting this this one working.

Not just Official Reports, I would have said, but any message which
the Rules require you to send, eg Speaker Transition messages, 
Judgements, etc.

I think there are plenty of other unambiguous ways of picking out
Proposals in the Queue, even if they are unnumbered: by Title, by
Proposer, by date of submission, by position in the Queue.

Right. It seems to me, then, that official Proposal Numbering ought
to be delayed until the time of distribution.

I'm not planning on introducing it right now.  Someone asked me to
kick it out, so I did.  I've moved it back to the inactive queue for
now.

You are probably right. I'll look into an appropriate amendment.

I've said it before, I'll say it again. I have Netscape 4's mail settings set to
wrap at 72 chars. If anyone knows why it isn't wrapping at 72 and how to make it do
it properly, I'm all ears.

I'm sorry but, I don't know what I can do about it.
I have had one other mail go missing that I know of.
What about if I got a Hotmail address and got everything cc'd to it ?

I know they were having trouble with the main Southern link last week, but I thought that was finished with.

It might be time to find another ISP. The speed is good on this one, but their news server stinks, and now it appears that
their mail server has a problem also. That's one of the problems with living in a small city. We only have two local ISPs
(Interworx is 200% better than the other one), and the only ISPs with a local POP charge through the nose.

Bye for Now
