A repost of a proto I made 2 weeks back.

####
Proto-Proposal
Electioneering and the Public Voting Experiment

[Comment: it occurs to me that during the Public Voting Experiment,
we might as well allow the Assessor to publish summaries of everyone's
votes, since votes are being sent to the PF anyway. Am I right in
thinking that votes which have been sent to the PF have already been
disclosed in the sense of R1625, and that the Assessor cannot violate
that Rule by republishing them?]

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 452 be amended by replacing in it
the text which currently reads:

      This Rule shall in no way prohibit the Vote Collector from
      posting, at any time and to the Public Forum, a list of those
      Voting Entities which have already voted or declared that they
      are Present on a given Proposal, Election or Referendum, as
      long as e does not indicate specifically whether the Voting
      Entity has voted or declared Presence. Doing so is not a Crime,
      unless specified as such by another Rule.

with text which reads:

      This Rule shall in no way prohibit the Vote Collector from
      posting, at any time and to the Public Forum, a list of those
      Voting Entities which have already voted or declared that they
      are Present on a given Proposal, Election or Referendum. If a
      vote or declaration of Presence has already appeared in the
      Public Forum prior to the publication of such a list, then the
      Vote Collector is permitted to indicate how the Voting Entity
      has voted, or whether it has declared itself Present. Otherwise,
      the Vote Collector is prohibited from specifically indicating
      whether the Voting Entity has voted, or declared Presence. The
      publication of a list as described in this Rule is not a Crime,
      unless specified as such by another Rule.

Protoproposal Chaos1 [rev. 2]

Nonchallenge of Election Results

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1445 be amended, by appending the
following paragraph:

      * Cutoff for Challenges: Any challenge of the correctness of the
      announced results of an Election must be made within seven days
      of the time the results are announced.  If seven days pass from
      the time the results are announced without a challenge, the
      announced results are the true results of that Election, whether
      or not they be in error in any way.

As Andre has pointed out, "pay out" implies "from the Bank".

I basically added a clause stating that, when you would otherwise receive a
Degree, you don't actually receive it till you Move to the University.

But the truth of the CFJ at the time it was made is now known;
precisely because you have consented...  Ah well.  If you hadn't, then
the CFJ would have been difficult to judge.

elJefe:

I have several remarks.

1. Public voting is fun! The battle around 3585 is besoming one about
the quorum; I consider all these activities a major success of Steve's
Public Voting experiment.

This is a strong argument to make Public Voting a permanent
institution.

2. elJefe's strategy shows a major weakness of Public Voting, though:
opponents of a proposal can stop it by retracting their
votes. Effectively this means that proposals need an _absolute_
majority of players behind them to pass. 

This seems to me to be an unintentional side effect of Public
Voting. It either makes public voting pretty unattractive, or would
require a change of 1442 in the sense that votes once made cannot be
withdrawn again to prevent the proposal from achieving quorum.

I'm not making any allegations as to Swann's Hold status as
Cartographer. Swann's last known location (unless I missed
something) is the Stasis Chamber; e since tried to move to the Beer
Hall but that didn't work as e wasn't eir own Executor at that time.

I may be mistaken, but I think eir deregistration for lawlessness was

I disagree; I believe that cancelling a Vote is changing it, and thus
you are forbidden from doing so.

Now, this I think you can do.  Your two ABSTAINS will not be counted,
since the implicit delayed Transfer Order you submitted is thereby
cancelled.

Erick> I hereby cast two votes FOR Proposal 3591.

Also barred by Rule 1717.  However, I believe you have just reinstated
the implicit delayed Transfer Order needed to make your two ABSTAINs
count.

Erick> I'd like to note that I still receive my two VTs as per Rule

Assuming my reasoning above is correct, yes.

My Policy was assessed at the time of voting.

In any case, both Proposals seem to have reached Quorum.

Claim admitted.  I will use the previously described method of recalculating
the distribution by drawing another 17 random numbers between 0 and 16
inclusive.  Whenever the number 16 comes up, the corresponding Indulgence PO
will be vacated and a new one issued to Morendil...

(set! *random-state* (make-random-state #t))
;Value 6: #[random-state 6]

(random 17)
;Value: 9

(random 17)
;Value: 5

(random 17)
;Value: 16

(random 17)
;Value: 9

(random 17)
;Value: 5

(random 17)
;Value: 7

(random 17)
;Value: 10

(random 17)
;Value: 13

(random 17)
;Value: 12

(random 17)
;Value: 13

(random 17)
;Value: 12

(random 17)
;Value: 4

(random 17)
;Value: 4

(random 17)
;Value: 11

(random 17)
;Value: 14

(random 17)
;Value: 14

(random 17)
;Value: 11


So, the third Indulgence distribution is switched from Swann to Morendil.

I hereby vacate POI277 and order the Bank to pay one Indulgence to Morendil.

Here is my ranking, highest consideration first:

commonsense     (application of logic and rational thought to maximum extent).
past Judgements
game custom     (this usually seems to come out of past judgements).
best interests  (only as an absolutely last resort).

I recall looking over the various reports.  There have been no disputes of

the dispute of the Morendil's Indulgence POs.

That is so only on the reading that my consent retroactively installs
me as of the time of Jeff's resignation. I'm not saying that reading
is incorrect, but neither is it forced by R880.

If his location is the Stasis Chamber, does this mean he is still On Hold?

I believe he was deregistered for Lawlessness on Oct 04, and thus
became eligible to be reregistered on Nov 04.

Alternative: lower Quorum, say to 1/3 of (Active?) Players.

On the other hand, there is now a CFJ before the Courts which, if Judged
TRUE, will show that Morendil registered as a Player under the auspices
of R103 when he became Speaker.
