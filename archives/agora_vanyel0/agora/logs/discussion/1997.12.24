Re: DIS: R1454 The Virus

Correct.  If you happen to pick a Rule with Power>1 then you are done, and no
Rule gets infected that week.

Re: DIS: R1505 Infected

It depends on how the crime is defined in the Rules.  If it specifies it's own
penalty without refering to a standard class in R1505, then the penalty would
be applied as stated.  However, if the crime is defined with a penalty
specified only as one of the standard classes, then that penalty would be
undefined.  In a way there is still a penalty, it's just that the penalty has
no consequences that incur a loss or gain of any entities.
