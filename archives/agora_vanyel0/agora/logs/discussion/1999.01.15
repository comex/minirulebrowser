No, I won't. But if the Speaker wants to do so, of course he can.

Thanks. Will be corrected in the next report.

On the meta level, Andre, what's wrong about following your own
preference on this? I would argue for a nonzero BOS, of course, but I
would be perfectly happy to 'play this out' as a political conflic, in
which your hold on the Chancellor's office allows you to pursue a
policy you consider betetr, even if others don't like it. Then we
could try to oust you from the office, and have lots of other

Oh well, I guess it's also ok as it is.

Hi,

it's nice to hear from you, and I'm looking forward to see you join
the game!

>>
b) I haven't yet ascertained all the consequences from joining and not
doing anything.
<<

Until a few months ago you could have done that with no consequences
at all. You do need to post occasionally, just to assure us that
you're still out there; players who seem to have given up on the game
can become 'silent' and, if they still don't post to a public forum
for some time, be deregistered under R1042. But posting just anything
to the PF occasionally is, in principle, enough to avoid this.

In the last few months, however, a rule was created that forces
players to make proposals on a regular basis (R1865). We have also had
an obligation to vote for some time, but that was an experiment with a
limited duration and is over now.

If you fail to propose when it is your duty, you are fined a
penalty. If you can pay that, and do, everything is ok (it'll cost you
one indulgence and one P-note). If you can't, or don't, pay, you'll be
in debt for two currencies, and once these debts are old enough you'll
start to collect additional indulgence penalties for being in debt too
long (R1713). If this goes on long enough, you'll end up with 30 or
more 'blots' (indulgence debts); this gives other players the
possibility (but not duty) to declare you a lawless player and have
you deregistered for some time (R1714). However, this has only
happened once so far.

So it is possible to play the game on a very low level. It's not too
exciting, but possible. In fact, I'll have to reduce my level of
participation for a few weeks in the future, and I'm thinking of
giving power of attorney (R1842) to someone for this time (I could go
on hold, too, R1016).

You should also note that a lot of the enjoyable discussions happen on
the discussion list. It is good to subscribe to this list, because
that's where most of the fun is, but it is not legally necessary. So
when people are away for some time, they often unsubscribe from a-d
and only follow the official business. This happens in the PF only.

Hope that helps!

Kolja A.

But it isn't; as yet another bit of factual information, I just
discovered the bounce mail and it was from my ISP's SMTP server
itself, the first link along the chain. So AFAICT I definitely did
send the message containing the Proposal, but equally definitely it
never reached anyone except me. And the reason I didn't notice it
earlier is that my mail-sorting rules can't tell a bounce notice from
the copy of the mail that is returned to me by the mailing list, so
it just got shunted to my 'submitted proposals' folder.

I was thinking of the provision

      It is the responsibility of each Active Player to ensure that e
      is able to receive messages sent to every medium which the
      Registrar has designated as a Public Forum.  The temporary
      inability of a Player to receive a Public Forum does not deprive
      that medium of any legal significance as a Public Forum.

Now if I could justify adding "within a reasonable time" to that, I should
be happy - it has occured that email messages have been sitting in queues
for _years_.  Although I think that is a case for legislation to handle

I would not object to reading such a requirement into the definition
of "deliver".  Of course, I'm used to American traditions of judicial
construction, where far more outlandish things happen all the time. :)

Now if I could justify adding "within a reasonable time" to that, I should
be happy - it has occured that email messages have been sitting in queues
for _years_.  Although I think that should be a case for legislation to
handle.

What I would like to be careful about is when messages bounce to the list
administrator, and e passes them on later - we have certainly treated
these as legal before.  This seems similar to the case in CFJ 752 (from
the Stare Decisis list):

>>>>
Swann, 752:
Something sent to someone in such a way that that person has the  obligation
to send it to all Players is sufficient for it having been sent to the
Public Forum. (upheld upon appeal by CotC)

except that Steve does not actually have an obligation to pass such
messages on.

Greetings,
Ørjan.
