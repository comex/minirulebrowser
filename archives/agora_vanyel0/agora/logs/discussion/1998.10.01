Well, I feel that I have a right to play by my gut if I choose.  You may
play in a gutless manner if you so choose!  :)

The reason I didn't give a more thorough argument is that I don't have a
great amount of time to devote to the game.  I thought it better to offer my
opinion rather than nothing at all.  I'm sorry if that's unacceptable to
you.

I fail to see how you can say that lowering the VTCL is not a penalty for
not voting.  Especially since that is precisely what you are trying to
accomplish.  You wish to forcibly remove VT's from players that do not vote
simply because they did not vote.  In my book that's a penalty for not
voting.

As to any arguments that this is an incentive to vote, I hope you don't
develop any employee incentive programs where you work unless your goal is
to increase personnel turnover! :)

Absolute nonsense and rubbish.  By this standard I must be opposed to knives
because I am opposed to killing people with knives.  I am not opposed to a
reasonable level of taxation for the purpose of funding the bank so that the
collective debts of the Agoran community can be paid.  (This, btw, is not at
all what is being done with the taxation system we have now, but, perhaps
foolishly,  I have hope.)  Such a use for taxation is bearable precisely
because the rampant inflation that otherwise results is far worse than the
taxation itself.  The lesser of two evils.

The difference is that a VTCL of 5 does not allow a reasonable level of
savings, imo.  But apparently you don't see this because of your view that
penalizing savings is an incentive to vote.

I happen to feel that a reasonable level of savings can help to make a more
interesting game.  Because of my savings I'm in a much better position to do
battle against you on this proposal.  If I chose I could buy quite a few
AGAINST votes (I'm open to offers).  I think that such a fight makes the
game more interesting.  But if the VTCL is lowered too much it would be a
difficult thing to accomplish.

There is nothing terrifying about it short of having to spend my VTs on
proposals that aren't worth the PNotes necessary to get them out of the
queue.  As I have said many times before, I will vote when I see a proposal
that I care strongly enough about that it's worth a VT to me.  This one
definitely qualifies in that regard unlike many recent proposals (I will be
the first to admit that I, myself, haven't offered any interesting proposals
and thus am part of the problem).

I am so much opposed to this, I will offer two VTs the first 4 players to
vote AGAINST this.  Be careful to avoid Public Voting however.

And the thug that beats you for the contents of your wallet provides a
strong incentive to remain indoors at night.  Can't we have some type of
positive incentive?

> I'm open to other ideas.

I must admit that I can't offer much.  Perhaps, a rebate on the Voting
Tariff for those that vote on the 'winning' side?  Perhaps an award given
weekly or monthly to the player that voted the most often?

>I've already taken on board your suggestion of
> increasing VT supply.
>

Yes, I must admit that you have done that.  An increase in VT supply will
hopefully result in more votes.

I'm not against your goal of increasing votes.  I too would like to see more
voting.  I'm just opposed to your methods.  As an unemployed player I cannot
quickly amass wealth to be able to make a big play in the game.  I therefore
invest significant time saving and significant effort looking for the right
play to spend that wealth on.  I don't want that time and effort to be lost
by a sudden reduction of the VTCL.  Not all of us who enjoy playing the game
have the time on a weekly or daily basis to hold an Office.  I know I don't.
I wish that I did.  I'd gladly give that time to the game.  But I don't, and
so the pace at which I play is slower.  Should I be penalized for that?  I
think not.

You have misrepresented the operation of the VTCL and the taxing powers
of the Assessor. Levying taxes does *not* remove VTs from Players that
do not vote simply because they do not vote. When a tax is levied, *all*
Players, whether they vote or not, lose a fraction of their VTs, and not
because they haven't voted, but because there are too many VTs in
circulation. This can happen for other reasons than low voter turnout.
The BOS might be set so high that even a high voter turnout cannot soak
up the extra liquidity. Players may have been exploiting the bug in the
Internomic Rules that awards 5 VTs to Players who get IN Proposals
passed. There's a big conceptual difference between the way the VTCL
operates, and the imposition of a penalty for not voting. 'A Duty to
Vote' imposes such a penalty, in a highly restricted range of
circumstances - but let's not run separate issues together. I maintain
that lowering the VTCL does not impose a penalty for not voting. It
only gives Players a reason to spend rather than save. In fact, having
the VTCL at all gives Players a reason to spend rather than save.
Lowering the VTCL simply makes the reason more urgent.

What we're disagreeing about is what is "reasonable" level of savings.
I'm coming at this from a *game design* point of view. Many games have
limits which prevent players from hoarding resources. In Risk, no player
may have more than 5 cards; in Settlers of Catan, the operation of the
robber makes it extremely dangerous for players to keep more than 10
cards in their hands at a time. These limits force Players to think
differently about the use of those resources. I want Players to think
differently about VTs, to have a more easy come, easy go, attitude
toward them.

Why? Lowering the VTCL does not affect anyone's relative ability to save
VTs. That is, it does not make it any harder than it already is for some
Players to save VTs than others. Obviously, as Distributor and CotC, my
income exceeds yours, so my ability to save VTs is in that sense
greater, but this has nothing to do with the level of the VTCL. Look at
it this way: you're using your savings to fight against P3792; I'm using
mine to fight for it. I agree that such fights are interesting, and I
wish that Players would make more controversial Proposals so that they
would happen more often. But even if the VTCL were now at 5, we'd still
be fighting over P3792. We'd just have to be a lot more canny about how
we went about it, since our respective abilities to distribute VT
largesse would both be similarly restricted. We'd have to sell Election
votes, votes on future Proposals, P-Notes, Indulgences, what have you.
Well, we can sell all those things now, too, of course. The point is
that the battles would be just as interesting.

Now, on 'A Duty to Vote':

And what is so terrifying about that? Yes, you might occasionally
(though, as an unemployed Player, not very often) find yourself having
to vote on a Proposal that you don't care so much about. I say: good!
Perhaps it will encourage you to think more carefully about the merits
of the Proposal, rather than dismissing it airly with an "I'm not going
to vote on that." If Players have a duty to vote, you will not be able
to rely on Proposals you don't like failing Quorum; heavens! you might
actually have to vote against them! Quelle domage!

I'll match Macross' offer, and offer 2 VTs to the first 4 Players to
vote FOR P3792 after this message,

Really, Macross, is it necessary to so grossly distort my position?
Comparing the operation of the VTCL to being violently mugged is
intemperate and irresponsible. And by doing so, you completely undermine
your own claim that you are not opposed to the VTCL tout court.
