What original proposal? Were we discussing a Proposal? Or even a

Maybe even 'proposal' is too strong; just 'idea,' then. But in any event, 
it *came* from you:

That's bordering on self-contradiction.  Here's my best suggestion so far:

"For the purpose of all Rules except this one, a message in a Shared Public
 Forum is deemed to be in the Public Forum only if it states clearly that it
 pertains to Agora, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding."

Similarly.

I had in fact decided to give in on the 2 months issue, as it's obvious
that I'm in a minority of one on that issue.  As for the announcement,
I had more to contribute to the debate, as there are some interesting
issues involved.

`Silent' is good.  Of course, we'll have to retitle the Rule.

Because the provision below requires the date to be expressed in the
same form in all child nomics.  With the above date that would result
in everything using the +1200 timezone, which is at odds with all other
times used in the ruleset.  I regard Happy Birthday as an exception,
in that it is recording part of Michael's email message rather than a
time that actually has any effect.  (I would, however, have preferred
Happy Birthday to use UTC uniformly, rather than being an exception.)

The nomic created doesn't have any Players other than those actually
creating it, so this is not a situation of a subset of Players imposing
their will on the game.  It's more akin to Group or Contest creation than
an Election.  So I don't think a proportional requirement would be at
all suitable.  However, I think it would be reasonable to require four
or five Senators, as it probably shouldn't be as easy as Group creation.

It requires a distinction between *the* Public Forum (where messages take
legal effect), and *a* Public Forum (which may be Shared or Unshared,
and whose messages are normally considered to be in the PF).  Can you
think of a better way to put it?  Do I need to invent new terminology?

I don't like this deeming.  Much better to just define the above
distinction.

I would disagree; I say that Proposals can conflict with the Rules,
but when they do, they lose.
