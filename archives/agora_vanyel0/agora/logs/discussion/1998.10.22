I don't understand your way of rounding, Crito. Did you always round
fractions up? Maybe I can't reproduce the taxed amounts because I
don't have the correct indulgence holdings of just before the tax, but
I'm curious anyway. 

And of course I'd like to see some justification for your rounding
_up_ instead of down - it is obvious that you are unable to bill
players for the exact, noninteger amounts. But I don't see what rules
authorize you to tax us for _more_ than the amount required by the
tax rule.

Of course, I'm saying all this without anger - I wanted this tax, and
I also welcome the chance to establish a precedent for rounding
procedures.

DIS: Re: BUS: Indulgence Taxation

I used standard "banking" rounding procedures.  Anything less than .5 is
rounded down; anything greater than .5 is rounded up.  That is, the number is
rounded to the *closest* integer.  Actually, I forget which is the standard way
to round an exact .5 (I think it's up), but since nobody ended up with 80%
equal to exactly n.5 anyway, it's not an issue here.

As to justification - I am interpreting R1853 as requiring me to compute an
amount of tax to be levied on each Player based on eir holdings and some
percentage, but that the indivisibilty of the Currency, as defined by the MUQ
of that Currency, requires this computation be made in units of the MUQ (hence
the need for rounding).  Therefore, IMO, the "amount required by the tax rule"
*is* the rounded figure - not the "raw" rational number generated by the
percentage computation, so that I am not, as you were afraid might be the case,
taxing Players for more than the Rules authorize.  Note that R1853 does not say
I have to bill Players *exactly* N% of their holdings, just that I have to
express the amount of the levy as a percentage when I make the announcement.

Also, in terms of establishing precedents for rouding procedures, IMO, since
there is nothing explicit in the Rules as to how tax collectors must make the
individual tax calculations, they can use any method of rounding their li'l ol'
hearts desire 8), whatever anyone else has done in the past.

Although if we use Rule 1577 as our basis to round at all, we should
note that this Rule requires rounding to the nearest multiple;
therefore, the only underspecified situation is rounding exact halves.

Actually, as it turns out, the number of Blots currently equals the number of
Indulgences.  So no distribution will be required.  However, it is a potential
bug in the Indulgence tax rule that, if Players don't respond promptly to the
tax POs, a new Indulgence distribution will be required at the beginning of the
next week and will undo some of the tax.

I think that's the wrong metaphor and the wrong question to ask. We are
constantly playtesting the Rules. We introduced Risky Rebellion, and in
the course of playtesting we discovered a bug: a successful Rebellion
takes all the Blots out of the economy without taking Indulgences with
them. (And now Crito has discovered another bug: POs for Indulgences
count as Blots, even if they were issued for the purposes of taxation
and not for penalizing Crimes or Infractions.) Since the concept of
Indulgences as anti-Blots was introduced, there's always been a concern
to make sure that the number of Indulgences in circulation is always
about the same, or slightly less than, the number of Blots, because we
want Indulgences to be highly sought after. To meet that concern, the
discovery of the Rebellion bug necessitated something like an Indulgence
tax. So the right question to ask is: what is the point of persisting
with a wildly unbalanced game state that is the result of a bug?
Especially when the economic aspects of the game that we want to explore
(scarcity, trading), will only be accentuated by correcting the game
state to account for the effects of the bug. It might have taken 6
months for 50 Indulgences to be spent paying off Blots - why should we
wait, given that Indulgence scarcity is what we're really interested in?
