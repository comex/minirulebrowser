I tend to think that it probably would be. I think it's probably best
to consider every Rule as implicitly claiming that it is in effect,
unless it explicitly claims otherwise. If you take this view, you arrive
at Oerjan's position (as I understand it), which is that R1513 can
deprive Rules with lower precedence than it of their effect, R101
notwithstanding. I think this is the position I now hold, despite
my earlier having said that R101 would prevent R1513 from depriving
any Rule of its effectiveness. Oerjan's insight, quoted in the first
paragraph of his above, is what changed my mind.

All of which sounds like an argument for legally defining "made
available" and letting the chips fall where they may, against
the position defended by Crito on this matter.

Oerjan, you have developed a delightful property: I can no longer tell
when you're being serious.

Taking the suggestion at face value, though, I'll just point out that
crises happen. During a crisis, questions arise which actually or
potentially go beyond the ability of the Rules to settle. Example from
Nomic World: it was never settled whether Blob did or did not win Game 3.
I can make no sense of the idea of there being an absolute answer to
the question of whether e did or e didn't.

There should be a Crime analogous to Misrepresentation attached to
the act of executing a PO by a Player who believes e is not authorized
to do so - Misappropriation perhaps ?

The relevant message does not refer to Blots at all, but merely
quotes a category of penalty, which seems insufficient - the norm
for reporting an Infraction now is to append a phrase similar to
"X is hereby commanded to pay Y as penalty". _That_ can be validly
called an 'order', merely mumbling a few words about penalties
cannot.

Furthermore, I wasn't at that time concerned with Blob's and Elde's
affairs and as such had no reason to review IPOs extensively - now
that I am and that the flurry of Judicial activity over the general
legal grounds for IPOs has abated, I have at last been able to devote
a couple hours to this research into the actual facts of the POs
that seem fishy to me.

As far as I'm concerned the Rules place no limitation on how long
after the fact outstanding POs may be contested.

I have good reason for believing that it is not so.

It is questionable - you were required to vacate & reissue. I don't
know whether that means that the two original POs are still outstanding
(I rather think they are). But your report is then in error in listing
these two POs, and in listing them with Blob and Elde as Payors rather
than Elde and me, isn't it ?

This is rather interesting - 1431 states that you are not required
to provide a Response to COEs regarding this error, since you already
responded to the same COE - but your 'correction' apparently left
the error uncorrected ?

Don't go out of your way to provide me with time stamps, though - I
already have all Agora mail archived, and I've done all the research
I needed to do.

Sorry - I had to do it at the end of the week, otherwise Elde would have
gotten slapped with one more unjustified Persistent Indebtedness Infraction.
(The one stemming from Elde's Blots I do not dispute.)

However, you have my sincere apologies if this has inconvenienced you -
I must again note that your work as Herald is exemplary. It's precisely
_because_ your latest report was as rigorous as it was that I was
finally able to review all those POs for 'procedural' problems.

I want to note that I'm pursuing the matter, as I did that of the legal
basis for IPOs, in the spirit of mapping the limits of P/C, establishing
what the proper forms for Payment Orders are, and generally have a fun
time with the new possibilities for litigation that P/C opens up.

I examined this before I based a COE on the opposite conclusion. I note
one problem with this claim. You state that the following sentence

      Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their
      legal report, and the Player making the report of the Infraction
      shall execute whatever Payment Order(s) are required to apply
      the penalty specified for that Infraction.

seems contradictory ("in tension with itself") or ambiguous. However,
you derive that contradiction from 1599, which states that when a
Player is required to execute a PO, e must do so within seven days.

I note that 1599 contains the following deference clause :

      This Rule defers to any Rule which specifies a different time
      limit for executing Payment Orders.

This seems to me to defuse any claim that interpreting 1504 as requiring
POs constitutive of the penalty for an Infraction to be executed at the
time the Infraction is reported causes a contradiction, or even a
conflict.

I read 1504 as "applied immediately [...] and the Player [...] shall
[immediately] execute". I also happen to believe that this is the 
more natural reading, and that your argument is somewhat contrived.

Your case-sheet has "Judge: Vir" at some point - I don't recall if 938
was actually assigned to Vlad or Vir initially, I assume it was Vlad as
this Infraction report as well as the case-sheet mention Vlad in all
other places. This is not a COE...

BTW, your phrasing of the Payment Orders is neat - it actually gives
no hint as to how you're likely to Judge 939 and 940. ;)

Good point. However, I'M afraid you should have pointed that out when
I protoed this a fw weeks ago... Now the proposal stands as it is.

One might be afraid that the moderator can abuse this to end the
voting period at a time that makes IN's vote concur with eir
wishes. But: E may only end the voting period when all members have
voted, so e doesn't have much of a chice here, after all. I guess if
the proposal does get through (which seems hard enough, given the
number of proposals that failed recently - effectively every voting
member has a veto at the moment) we'll just have to keep our fingers
crossed and hope noone notices ;) - or maybe propose an amendment
right away.

BTW, can we already vote in the Agora referendum on this proposal? It
has been dirtibuted already, but only as an internal information, I
guess - it probably hasn't been officially distributed in IN.

I think that this proto might allow illegaly made POs to cause
Persistent Indebtedness penalties. As a safegurd against this kind of
abuse we would either need penalties for making unauthorized POs that
are much worse than this negative effect for the Payor named in an
unauthorized PO, or some kind of timing aspect - delaying the
Persistent Indebtedness penalties long enough that unauthorized POs
have been vacated before the PI penalties are applied or some such
thing. 

Or is this already accounted for by the existing possibility to
dispute the POs? IT's the timing aspect that worries me here: Assume I
issue the unauthorized POs just before the end of the nomic week. Then
the PI penalties will kick in before the victim Payor has time to get
a COE published.

Guess I'd be severely tempted to try and make Elde lawless this way...

Maybe not, see the Double Jeopardy Rule and think a while. I think
it prevents recurring P.I. penalties.

No, the PO has to be outstanding for a week before Indebtedness penalties
are incurred - normally ample time to settle the debts. One problem
is Players who are On Hold - as Swann remarked, they should not have
to deal with such problems more than once.

> Guess I'd be severely tempted to try and make Elde lawless this way...

Elde is already subject to multiple unfair and hotly... disputed penalties.
However rest assured that any attempt to illegally submit POs naming
Elde (or Blob, for that matter) would *not* go unnoticed.

Plus, the penalties for a Class C Crime are no joke.

It is possibly appropriate that the penalties for Misappropriation
(using the name for short, not attempting to impose the notion) should
be equivalent to that for Misrepresentation, but I'm not sure it's
a good idea to have the criminal category Misrepresentation specifically
serve the purpose of punishing the act that your proto criminalizes.

I believe that the criminal category of Misrepresentation should not
be equated with Misappropriation, and, incidentally, that the current
ranking of penalties for Misrep. and the associated criminal categories
of Falsification and Perjury are not suitable, both beliefs stemming
from the same classification of Crimes of this nature according to
how easily relief from their ill effects can be sought.

(Actually, illegally executing a PO is a case of Falsification, since
all Recordkeepors are Officers and they are required to act upon the
submission of POs, at least by recording them.)

Falsification should be a Class A Crime. It consists of giving false
information to an Officer, which Officer will in most cases publish
such information or alter eir records according to such information
so that most, if not all Players, will as a consequence be in possession
of false information. Any Player acting upon such false information
may perform, or fail to perform, acts that e would otherwise not have
performed or not failed to perform, and no provision exists in the
Rules to provide relief to such Players in such cases. Falsification
is therefore among the most damaging non-retractable illegal moves
one Player can perform.

Misrepresentation should be a Class B Crime, as it has nearly the
same consequences as Falsification, but does involve an Officer,
in whom Players usually place their trust and whose publication of
false information is more likely to be regarded as guaranteeing the
truth of that information; in cases of Misrepresentation Players
can be assumed to be more cautious in taking the pronouncements of
a non-Officer at face value. Of course Officers can also commit
that Crime, and currently 1497 makes no such distinction; the definition
of Falsification should IMHO be broadened to include information a
Player is required to provide in the course of Official Duties.

Perjury should be a Class C Crime; a normal Judgement can always be
Appealed when it is suspected that evidence supplied was misleading.
When committed by a Justice serving on a Board of Appeals, Perjury
should be assimilated to Falsification, but otherwise its effects
can be reversed by the higher Court within a rather short delay.

Misappropriation should be a Class D Crime, or if that is too lenient
halfway between Classes C and D. It is always possible to Dispute
an improperly executed PO, and Judges have at their disposal adequate
means to afford Players relief for any damage caused by such acts.

We should not be concerned that the same act can be an instance of
more than one of the above Crimes, as our Double Jeopardy Rule
provides a way to prosecute a Player for the narrowest applicable
category. (There should be an option to Dismiss a CFJ on the
grounds of overbroad criminal classification of a given act. But
at worst a Player so prosecuted can always Appeal and file a CFJ
claiming the lesser penalty - IOW e can 'plead guilty' so to
speak.)

BTW, I think a case could be made that the Double Jeopardy Rule
prohibits multiple Infractions for Persistent Indebtedness being
applied for overlapping sets of Payment Orders - i.e. if you get
cited on Mon. 15 for Indulgence Debt for a PO dated Mon. 8 you
cannot be cited on Mon. 22 for the combination of that PO and the
latter one. Opinions pro or contra ?

No.  The relevant messages do refer to Blots.

Obviously.  However, I expressed my concerns to the Player's at large at the
time concerning this issue in general, not just specifically to Blob and Elde. 
I received no response, other than to have the Player's issuing PO's become
more explicit in their formulations.

True.  You are within your rights to contest these POs, and I think I am within
my rights as Herald to deny the claim based on game custom which I seem to have
established by accepting these messages as POs.  I won't complain too much if a
CFJ overturns this, except to grumble about the fact that it should have been
done when I asked about it in the first place.  8)

Nope.  I think you are confused because one of the POs in question was already
satisfied by you.  POI015 and POI017 are the two POs at issue here.  They were
originally issued to Blob and Elde respectively, but then I corrected them to
be issued to Elde and Morendil, as they should have been originally.  I think
it is true that the original POs should have been vacated rather than simply
corrected, but I have been cutting a lot of slack with people regarding PC and
it would be nice if you could return the favor here.  The correction was
legitimate, and the current reports are consistent with vacating and reissuing
them, since I would no longer have to report those particular POs if they had
been vacated at the time.

No, the error was not left uncorrected.  See above.

I suppose you ended up doing a lot of research here.  But it would have been
nice if you could have contested the report as soon as possible after it came
out, rather then the day before the next report was due out.

Yes.  I appreciate this, which is why I have refrained from any Kudo activity
even though keeping track of all these "zombie" POs and responding to multiple
claims on old POs is something of a pain.  8)

Well, I'm not likely to Judge 940 at all... And apart from that, I was just
making sure, as I hadn't made up my mind yet. I'll just check all the
business.

You list the Judge as Vir, but the header and comments say it was reassigned to
Steve.  Which is correct?

Fortunately, a PO has to be at least 7 days old before the PI Infraction can
apply to it.  This gives an alert player plenty of time to dispute a PO issued
just before the end of the nomic week.

I think adequate safeguards are already in place, in the form of the
disputation rules.  The only thing we might want to consider is
abrogating PI penalties for Players who are On Hold, perhaps by
stating that a P/O which becomes due while the Executor of its Payee
is On Hold instead becomes due three days after e ceases to be On
Hold.  Or something similar.

Nope.  A PO does not become due until one week after its publication.
The PI penalty is assessed at the start of each Nomic Week _after_ the
PO becomes due and remains unpaid.  You always have at least seven
days to pay (or dispute) a PO before PI penalties begin to be
assessed, and may have as much as just under fourteen.  A week is more
than enough time for an Active Player to respond, which means that the
only concern need be for Players on Hold.

I guess it would depend on whether you consider the PI Infraction relates to a
failure to satisfy a specific PO, or whether it is considered to be related
merely to the fact that you have undisputed, unsatisfied POs at the beginning
of the week.  The Rule, as written, seems to favor the later interpretation. 
It would seem that this makes it a new Infraction each week, regardless of the
source of the unsatisfied POs, not double jeopardy.

It might be more fair to remove POs issued as a result of PI from being
considered in determining later PI Infractions.  Of course, this will increase
the workload on the Herald.  Might be nice to increase eir salary in the
proposal that sets this up.  8)

Double Jeopardy assumes that an Infraction is an act or a failure to 
act. The only way to interpret P.I. in this light is as a failure to 
act. The question is, are all Infringers protected by D.J., or can 
there be some Infractions that do _not_ result from an act or a 
failure to act.

I tend to concur.  Especially since you can't point to any one P/O and
say "This is the one which leads to the Infraction".  The Infraction
is for having _any_ unpaid overdue P/Os drawn on a given Currency at
the beginning of the week.  Doesn't matter how many P/Os you have in
that Currency.

I don't see why.  At present, most Indebtedness Infractions are for
Indulgences anyway, so no additional Infractions arise.

You might say that the PI Rule, as written, describes an Infraction that does
not directly arise from an act or failure to act, but arises from a Player
having a specific property - overdue POs.  However, even if you take the more
intuitive view that PI is an Infraction that results from a failure to act,
i.e. failure to satisfy overdue POs during the preceeding week, a Player
failing to perform some action during the one week is a distinct event from the
same Player failing to perform some action during the next week, even if it is
essentially the same action that should have been performed.  It still seems to
me that D.J. applies only if the Infraction is related to the failure to
satisfy a particular PO, in which case you can only be cited for PI once per
PO.

But this is not the way the PI Infraction Rule is worded.  It cites the failure
to satisfy any outstanding POs that were still due at the beginning of the
week.  It doesn't matter how the POs came to be outstanding, each week marks a
distinct episode of failing to act and each then is a new and unique
Infraction.

Social sanctions seem a bit too weak, because there is a dreadful scam
hidden there: use this + the Lawless Rules to deregister all other
Players.

So while I support this idea, I strongly suggest Amending the Lawlessness
Rule to exclude Blots that are either directly unauthorized or stem
directly or indirectly from penalties assessed from unauthorized Debt. 
Amending the Debt Rule itself similarly may also be a good idea.

The latter, methinks.  The Infraction of Persistent Indebtedness is a
status offense, rather than an offense of omission or an offense of
commission.

I mentioned that possibility, too, but forgot that the payor of every
PO has seven days to dispute the PO, and PI penalties do not apply to
disputed POs. This should give a potential victim enough time to avoid
utter ruin. The lifespan of unauthorized POs is further limited by
Scott's provision that

Come to think of it, though, there is still a way to scam left:
Execute payment orders with the same payor for 30 _indulgences_ - and
voila, the victim is lawless on the spot. So Oerjan is right, after
all.

I didn't say that the absolute answer had to be discoverable. What I meant
(I think) is that a mathematical mind, when reasoning about matters, must
assume that there is an absolute answer, and thus may not shift
arbitrarily between arguments that stem from mutually contradictory
premises.

Good point.  Recommend changing the definition of Lawless to only
include Indulgence POs which are overdue.

Correct - my apologies. I misremembered that message as mentioning 
"the penalty for a Class D Crime", but that was another post.

If you remember I also intervened in that regard, mentioning what I 
believed was the correct form for POs. Not that I want to reproach 
your policy; I just think that the recent, in-depth examination of 
the effects of P/C show it wrong.

The one that's satisfied matters little, the other one is another
problem - I can't really afford to return favors as long as I stand
the risk of having my favorite Player ;) deregistered for
Lawlessness. But I'll let the Courts handle this for now.

That's the burden of Office for you - and none of the damn bastard 
plebeian Players hardly ever showing any gratitude in return.

Which I think is completely against the 'spirit' of the Infraction 
Rules (and, naturally, D.J.). But that may be so, that may be so.

Bzzt, wrong. I had an inkling of this when I started thinking about 
D.J., and Rule 1503 bears me out -

Rule 1503/3 (Power=1)
Crimes and Infractions

      The Rules can penalize Players for performing, or failing to
      perform, some specific action.  Such penalized actions, or
      failures to act, are defined as either Crimes or Infractions.

Note that this, to use the recently developed Nomic Property
formalism, assigns the NP of being either a Crime or an Infraction to
acts performed by Players, or failures on their part to take "some
specific action", and no other set of circumstances. There is no
such thing as a "status offense", to use your term, that is also an
Infraction.

My initial question therefore applies : in the case of a Player 
penalized for Persistent Indebtedness, what is the act that, because 
that Player failed to perform it, caused em to incur the penalties 
for that Infraction ?

One reply is that there is no such act. The P.I. Rule attempts to
define a set of circumstances, which fail to comprise any single act
such that, if performed by a Player, that Player will not have
committed that Infraction, but if e fails to perform it, then e will
have committed it. 

This applies to the general case - in some specific cases, P.I. 
penalties are incurred for the failure to satisfy one single PO. 
However, the fact that 1713 fails the "single act" test in the 
general case might be interpreted to mean that Persistent 
Indebtedness is not a validly defined Infraction.

We might however argue that 1713 applies to the fullest possible
extent, i.e.that in specific instances it penalizes one specific
failure to act (i.e. to satisfy a specific Payment Order) and that, 
though it may not apply to penalize the same Player for a PO that is 
still overdue the week after the first penalty has been incurred, 
that Player may be subject to further P.I. penalties if further POs 
have been executed naming them as Payor and _those_ have become 
overdue, on the grounds that it is eir failure to perform a different 
act, namely satsifying that new PO, that is constitutive of the 
Infraction.

I would also counter this interpretation based upon my metaphysical
premise that continued failure to act is not separable into multiple 
failures to perform different acts. But I'd also like to point out 
the wording of both the D.J. Rule, 1652 :

Rule 1652/0 (Power=1)
Double Jeopardy

      <snip>

      For any single act (or failure to act), a Player can only once
      be subject to the penalty of each Crime of Infraction resulting
      from that act.

and of Rule 1713 :

Rule 1713/1 (Power=1)
Debt

      <snip>

                                   If an entity has more than one
      Overdue Payment Order naming it as payor, its Executor commits
      as many such Infractions are there are different Currencies
      named in all these Overdue Payment Orders.

The latter combines the existence of several distinct POs into one
well-defined set of circumstances which is constitutive of the
Infraction (which rightly leads Scott to categorize it as a "status
offense"). But as 1503 defines Infractions, we may not reason in such 
terms; rather, I would construe this as meaning that the 'cause' of 
the Infraction is in part attributed to each relevant PO. 

I enquote 'cause' to mean, specifically, the relationship converse
to that embraced by 1652 when it mentions "[the] Infraction
resulting from that act"; in view of the above I would further assume 
that each relevant PO is, in part, 'resulting in' the Infraction, and 
therefore that the penalties for such may not be applied more than 
once for except for disjoint sets of POs.

Further comments before I lob this to the Courts ?

Well, I figured "lying" = "deliberate stating of a supposed untruth," which is pretty much the

It's the end of the *next* Nomic Week. Any Player would have at least seven days to dispute the 
PO before they start getting PI penalties.

I was hoping someone would bring this up. Several of the amendments occuring in my latest report 
would be invalid if this did indeed prevent further amendments. However, it is my personal 
opinion that it does not do so. Why? Look at this paragraph from the Frankenstein Rule:

      This is the last paragraph. This Rule can only be subject to a
      Rule Change as described by the Frankenstein Generator.  This
      Rule takes precedence over all other Rules that would otherwise
      allow this Rule to be changed in any manner whatsoever.

This certainly seems to give implicit permission to the Frankenstein Generator to change the FR 
in whatever manner it describes. Whether that is sufficient is another question...

I strongly advise Crito to DENY this COE. Look at the following text from R1435:

      A Payment Order for 1 Indulgence, the payee of which is the
      Bank, is called a Blot.  When a Rule states that a Player is to
      gain some number of Blots, a Payment Order shall be executed
      with that Player as the payor, the Bank as the payee, and for a
      number of Indulgences equal to the number of Blots that Player
      is to receive.  This order is to be executed by whomever is
      required to report the change in Blots.

This is quite specific about the way that Blots be assessed.

OK. We'll have to wait and see, I guess.
