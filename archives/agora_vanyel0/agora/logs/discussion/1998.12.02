Protoproposal Chaos44 [rev. 4]

Oh, what a tangled web....

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 478 be amended to read:

      (a) A Public Forum is any medium of communication so designated
          as such by the Registrar.

      (b) The Registrar may designate any medium as a Public Forum, or
          revoke such designation from a medium already so designated,
          Without Objection.  However, The message which is to
          effectuate the change intended must be sent via a medium
          which is a Public Forum both before and after the
          designation or revocation, in order to have legal effect.

      (c) Every Active Player shall ensure that e is able to receive
          messages sent to every medium which the Registrar has
          designated as a Public Forum.  However, the temporary
          inability of a Player to receive a Public Forum does not
          deprive that medium of its status as a Public Forum.

      (d) Any message conveyed by one or more Public Fora is deemed to
          have been sent to the Public Forum.

      (e) Subdivision (d) of this Rule notwithstanding, any message
          sent, by any medium or combination of media, to every Active
          Player so that each Active Player is reasonably certain to
          receive it, is deemed to have been sent to the Public Forum,
          but only if it bears a clear indication that it is intended
          to be a Public Forum message.

      (f) Whenever the Rules require a Player to "announce", "post",
          or "distribute" some communication or notification, that
          Player shall do so by sending it to the Public Forum, unless
          the Rules specify otherwise in that instance.

Unlimited Voting

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 206 be amended to read:

      (a) A Voting Entity is an Entity which is generally authorized
          by the Rules to cast a vote or votes on a Proposal.  Other
          Rules may withdraw this authorization from a Voting Entity
          in specific circumstances without that Entity thereby
          ceasing to be a Voting Entity.  Only those Entities
          designated by the Rules to be Voting Entities are Voting
          Entities.

      (b) No Entity is permitted to vote on a Proposal unless it is a
          Voting Entity.

      (c) Players and Groups are Voting Entities.

      (d) Unless otherwise specified, each Voting Entity may cast an
          unlimited number of Votes on a Proposal.

Be it further resolved, that Rules 1660 and 1765 be repealed.

Some Housecleaning

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 408 be amended to read:

      (a) The Judge of an open CFJ is required to, within seven days
          of when that CFJ last became open or seven days of eir
          assignment to that CFJ, whichever is later, close that CFJ
          by dismissing or judging the CFJ and/or granting or denying
          any outstanding judicial motions pertaining to that CFJ.

      (b) The failure of a Judge to close a case within the prescribed
          time constitutes the Infraction of Judicial Tardiness and
          carries a penalty of one Blot for each day (or fraction
          thereof) that the case remains open beyond the permitted
          time.  This penalty is to be reported by the Clerk of the
          Courts.

      (c) The failure to observe this time limit does not, by itself,
          cause the delinquent Judge to be recused from the CFJ, nor
          does it invalidate eir judgment or dismissal of the CFJ or
          grant or denial of any related judicial motion which that
          Judge might submit after the limit has expired.

      (d) This Rule defers to any other Rule which prescribes a
          different time limit in which a CFJ must be closed, and to
          any other Rule which establishes procedures by which the
          time limit specified in this Rule may be extended or
          shortened.

I personally am wholeheartedly in favor of this proposal, but I think
it will be hard to find a majority. Most Agorans prefer to start up
an economy, and this will make them have to start almost from the
beginning.


Note that this proposal needs Adoption Index 2 to be effective.

I don't like this kind of thing. Why not just change each usage of
"Voting Entity" to "Player"?

A bit too strict. I'd rather make it:

        (d) Votes, once cast according to this Rule, cannot be
            retracted, cancelled, or changed except when the Rules
            require or allow it, and then only as required or
 	    regulated by the Rules.

Perhaps add a restriction that e may not use both usages of this rights
for the same Proposal, or both for a Proposal e emself proposed.

Might be a nice idea for the normal change to, that one is not allowed
to increase the Priority of one's own proposal.

1. Does Rule 1772 really need to be repealed?
2. With the use of Voting Tokens and P-Notes gone, why not abolish them?
   Or at least change to a single currency?

I think we should always go ahead and use a-d.  In that vein, I'd like
to announce that I had my viva (oral examination) for my PhD on
Friday, and my examiners are recommending that it be accepted without
change.  I'll be graduating in May.  

I don't think it's truly sunk in yet.  

May agora-discussion be filled with much chat. 

Michael.  
PS: I'm about to go on Hold.  If anyone would like to be Registrar,
Chancellor and/or Justiciar until elections are held, please get in
touch and/or post consent in advance to the PF.  Morendil will get
them by default if no-one expresses an interest.

I hereby vote thus:
3810: FOR
 I don't know the peculiarities of the crisis, but I guess it's a
 good idea.
3811: AGAINST
 Why abolish the Office of Ambassador? I think it's still a useful
 function. Without IN a reduced salary would be in place, but
 slamming the door this loud does not seem like a good idea.
3812: 2 AGAINST
 Unnecessary addition of complexity.

Looking at the small number of proposals with positive priority, I
feel confirmed in my impression that the proposal batch size was
increased prematurely. 

For some weeks the batch size two caused real competition for the top
places in the queue, and many proposals had priority two when they
were distributed. I don't think this will happen again soon if the
batch size remains at three. What about going back to two again?

It's called "C formalised in HOL" and it's a rip-snorting read from
cover to cover.  Get it while you can.  :-)

Hmmm... We're closely related in our research then - I'm working
in formal methods too, in my case message sequence charts/process
algebra/testing

Never mind, I guess I'd have to take a course in theorem
proving before really understanding it.

In that case I suggest these be the Octarine Repeals.

Hi.  Note that when I resign in someone's favour, they don't become an
Electee to the Office in question.  They just get to hold the Office
until an Election determines a new Electee.  Of course, this can means
Office-holding for a long time.  (There hasn't been an Electee for
Notary since 7 September.)

At least two Proposals have priority two right now, and there are five

Too many changes.  I wanted something simple, and didn't want one of
those Proposals that has to amend a double dozen rules for a simple

Yes; what is now Rule 1772 is incorporated into Proposed Rule 1771,

Again, too much work for one Proposal.

Ok, maybe.  Kind of a subjective assessment.

Would appreciate your pointing out an actual precedence problem rather than just saying there might be some.  Any proposal might have some, for that matter.

*Only* insofar as there may be a dispute as to whether a Player is an Officer, since this is the only significant change - allowing Officers to make TOs directly from the Bank.  But this is really only a transfer of uncertainty from whether something is a valid PO to uncertainty whether something is a valid TO.  Scott may be right when e considers an uncertain TO to be worse than an uncertain PO.

The only exception is the Bank.  Hardly a swiss-cheese network, but definitely an exception.

>pointed out by Andre.

It doesn't solve the problem if you interpret "successfully executed" TO to mean any TO posted to the forum, regardless of whether it turns out to be valid.   My proposal attempts to make "negative" transfer TOs invalid and I think a reasonable interpretation would be that an invalid TO is not a successfully executed one.  In any case, the proposal was made before this bug was pointed out and was not specifically intended to fix it - something that can still be done with another proposal.  I urge Players to decide based on whether this is a good fix to the excess PO/TO work generated by the current system, as an alternative to Scott's more sweeping reforms.

Wonderful.  I hope these two are distributed simultaneously so Players have an interesting choice for currency reform (besides doing nothing).  Actually, I happen to like Scott's proposal.  I'll probably vote FOR both, in the hopes that one or the other will succeed.  8)

Protoproposal Chaos71 [rev. 1]

Make the Proposal Queue More Competitive  

Be it therefore resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) The Proposal Tariff is a number of P-Notes (which must be a
          multiple of the MUQ for P-Notes), greater than 0 and not
          more than 2.

      (b) The value of the Proposal Tariff, upon the adoption of the
          Proposal which created this Rule, is 1.

      (c) The Promotor may change the value of the Proposal Tariff by
          announcing its new value in the Public Forum, provided that:
        (1) the new value is within the range allowed by subdivision
            (b) of this Rule,
        (2) the announcement is made prior to midnight GMT Thursday,
            and
        (3) the Promotor has made no other such announcement earlier
            in the Week.

      (d) Whenever a new value is announced according to subdivision
          (c) of this Rule, the new value takes effect at the
          beginning of the next Nomic Week.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1771 be amended to read:

      A Player may increase or decrease the Priority of a Proposal in
      the Queue by announcing to the Public Forum that e does so, and
      paying a number of P-Notes to the Bank. For each multiple of the
      Proposal Tariff e pays to the Bank, the Priority of the Proposal
      is increased or decreased by one, as specified by the Player
      making the payment, provided that this transfer is not executed
      for any other purpose.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1701 be amended, by replacing "is 1"
with "is 0.01".

If both pass, the Rules will become a hopelessly befuddled mess, I
suspect.

Oh, definitely.  An uncertain transfer generates immediate uncertainly
in balances, which can have cascade effects on the certainty of the
validity of every subsequent transfer.  Payment Orders are the hedge
against this uncertainty, and your Proposal complete demolishes it.

A very ugly one, if you ask me.

Why wait?  My Proposal, already made and in the queue, will fix this
problem (admittedly by happenstance) anyway. :)

I would like to point out that, in addition to considerably reducing
Recordkeeping duties, my proposed system also allows for the
satisfaction of multiple debts with a single transfer and the ability
to prepay debts.  It also does away with Probate, which is apparently
something that most people don't seem to care for.

Probably for the most part.  There may be a few glitches caused by

That needs to be sub. a). Unless I've misunderstood something and you 
want the Proposal Tariff to always be 1. :)

Midnight of which Thursday ? This should be something along the lines 
of "between the start of the NW and midnight Thursday"...

Also... What is your intent ?

Or, as I prefer to look at it, a useful addition of functionality. I
made the proposal in response to General Chaos' threat to block any
attempt by the Notary to execute Plans disposing of the assets of
deregistered Players, if the execution of such Plans was made Without
Objection, as Murphy was suggesting. This Proposal would allow Murphy to
specify that such Plans can be executed Without 3 Objections, thus
preventing a single Player from stopping the process. Obvious the
concept has wider applications. This is a step we should have taken a
long time ago.

I note that Morendil, Crito and the General have all increased the
Priority of Proposals of theirs to 2 today.

Has anyone given any thought to what consequences will ensue if both

Having look looked at it briefly, I believe that, if Crito's is
numbered lower than mine, and both pass, all or almost all of my
Proposal will override Crito's.  If the opposite order holds, things
could be messy, but Crito's Proposal is older than mine and should
therefore be numbered lower.

I may endeavour to make a more thorough analysis, but keep in mind
that I have finals for the next two weeks.  I will be eating,
drinking, and dreaming civil procedure starting on about Saturday.

Why strictly greater than zero? Why not allow for periods of free Proposal
making?

Oops.  Fixed.

I rewrote this section; it's a lot simpler now.

Laurent> Also... What is your intent ?

To make things more interesting.  Lets the Promotor vary the cost of
Proposing, much as we now allow the Assessor to vary the cost of
Voting.

Protoproposal Chaos71 [rev. 2]

Make the Proposal Queue More Competitive  

Be it therefore resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) The Proposal Tariff is a number of P-Notes (which must be a
          multiple of the MUQ for P-Notes), greater than 0 and not
          more than 2.

      (b) The value of the Proposal Tariff, upon the adoption of the
          Proposal which created this Rule, is 1.

      (c) The Promotor may change the value of the Proposal Tariff by
|         announcing its new value in the Public Forum, provided that
|         the new value is within the range allowed by subdivision (a)
|         of this Rule.

      (d) Whenever a new value is announced according to subdivision
          (c) of this Rule, the new value takes effect at the
|         beginning of the next Nomic Week, unless the announcement is
|         made within three days of the end of the current Nomic Week,
|         in which case the new value takes effect at the beginning of
|         the Nomic Week following the next Nomic Week.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1771 be amended to read:

      A Player may increase or decrease the Priority of a Proposal in
      the Queue by announcing to the Public Forum that e does so, and
      paying a number of P-Notes to the Bank. For each multiple of the
      Proposal Tariff e pays to the Bank, the Priority of the Proposal
      is increased or decreased by one, as specified by the Player
      making the payment, provided that this transfer is not executed
      for any other purpose.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1701 be amended, by replacing "is 1"
with "is 0.01".

I don't think it's a bug. It makes sense from a certain point of view
that the more other Players propose, the sooner you will have to do so.
They're all doing their bit, after all, so why shouldn't you?

This modification is neither better nor worse than what we have now, I
think, just different.

What if we had two different types of Voting Token, one which could
only be used to vote FOR, and the other which only be used to vote
AGAINST? :)

I haven't really give mush thought to Blob's proposal but I had an idea of
how to handle this.

I am considering proposing (it's my turn in the rotation) a modification in
which proposing when you're not required to do so doesn't move you in the
list but instead causes your service to be automatically satisfied when it
does come up.  This will make the time between service periods proportional
to the number of players.

Also I am consider renaming the infraction to something like Dereliction of
Duty (are we using that yet?).  This is to make way for the possibility of
allowing activities other than Proposing to satisfy one's Duty.  It would be
nice to recognize that there are other ways of contributing to the game
(holding Office, for example).

Hey, I was going to suggest that!

In fact, we have discussed it before. I first heard of the idea from
someone describing a live face-to-face game of Nomic in which they used
black & white chess pieces to indicate votes FOR and AGAINST. Initially
every player had one of each, but then some smart alec made a rule 
which required each player to pass one piece to the right, each turn.
So sometimes you would end up with two black or two white piece, and
were unable to vote the other way, for a turn. 

It could be interesting. The voting rules would be easy to modify, but
how would we provide income? 

To save the Accountor from a complete bookkeeping nightmare, we could even
have a +ve Accountor and a -ve Accountor, one in charge of each currency.

That is pretty much what I suggested.

I have also considered making that change. I don't think holding Office
would be a good contender (too many Officers), but maybe judging a CFJ
could fulfill your duty too.

And may I recommend that the recordkeeping by transferred to another 
Office. The only reason why it was given to the Promotor was because it
required knowing when Proposals were submitted. This information is now
available to all Players, as Proposals must be made to the PF, so any
Officer could handle the job. I suggest we create a new office called 
"The Chief Whip".
