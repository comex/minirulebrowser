"As soon as possible after the beginning of the quarter, the Registrar

 only be Elected at the time specified by this Rule, Rules to the contrary
 notwithstanding."

"Each Nominee for Treasuror shall submit a valid Protobudget by the end of

"A valid Protobudget must contain all information that the Treasuror's
 Budget is required to contain."

(Now that I think about it, I don't like the idea of "This Protobudget is
 the same as Blob's, except that the Widgetkeepor's Salary is doubled"; the
 document ought to be self-sufficient.  One can simply copy and edit the
 current Budget.)

"If a Nominee submits multiple Protobudgets during the Nomination Period,
 only the last one is considered."

Ick.  Better to append a paragraph such as this:

"The previous text is entirely without legal effect.  As soon as possible
 after the beginning of the month, the Registrar shall pay out to every
 Player who does not receive any Officer's Salary for the previous month
 an unemployment benefit as set in the last Treasuror's budget.  After
 two quarters have passed, this rule will amend itself by deleting this
 paragraph."

Protoproposal h1 (Revised Summary Adoption)

Amend Rule 1883 (Adoption of Proposals Without Objection) to read:

	The Proposer of any Proposal may cause it to be Adopted Without
	Objection.  Such a Proposal is considered to be Disinterested.
	The Proposal is Adopted at the time its Proposer changes its status
	to Adopted in accordance with the procedure for performing changes
	Without Objection.  When a Proposal is Adopted Without Objection, it
	is removed from the Queue.

	In addition to any other requirements, no Proposal may be Adopted
	Without Objection unless it:

	(a) has been published in the Promotor's Report; and

	(b) has not yet been distributed.

	This Rule takes precedence over:

	(a) any Rule which would prevent a Proposal from being Adopted
            Without Objection;

        (b) any Rule which would prevent a Proposal Adopted Without
            Objection from being removed from the Proposal Queue; and

        (c) any Rule which would prevent a Proposal Adopted Without
            Objection from being considered Disinterested.

I had doubts about this type of system as I could be unclear to people 
which was the last protobudget the Nominee submitted.  Although the 
above version would be simpler.



>"A valid Protobudget must contain all information that the Treasuror's
> Budget is required to contain."

That would simplfy things alot.  I think I will change that.



>"If a Nominee submits multiple Protobudgets during the Nomination Period,
> only the last one is considered."

As above.  I think people could be confused, although I'm sure if 
asked why people would be confused I would not be able to hive a 
straight answer, and would only end up being confused myself.... I'll 
think about it, unless I suddenly remember why I thought this was such 
a bad way of doing things.

I think that I'll get rid of the "sunset clauses" altogether.  If it 
gets adopted and then removed I'm sure people will beable to return 
the rules to their current state, without any such ugly paragraphs 
having to be appended.

You still need to announce *in the Public Forum* that Macross's Probate is
complete.  However, your plan has already satisfied Payment Order "PO#59"
for P-Notes.  I assume that that's another reference to PR2032.03; Blob?

And if he had acted in a manner similar to yours, I would have acted
the same way. Don't forget that he has always had that power, since
an Official Document, if unchallenged, is assumed to correctly

How's this for a new version of SA?

A player may request that the Promotor summarily adopt any proposal in the
proposal queue.  The Promotor must then announce publicly that the proposal
will be adopted without objection in 3 days.  Such announcements should
probably be included in the proposal distribution report.  While this is
still scammable, it requires two players to cooperate, and an official
document published by the Promotor is more likely to be read all the way
through, especially if it is likely to contain such an announcement.

What do you think?

Interesting that you should mention my name is this thread.  I had an idea
to use the SA loophole and was hoping to reregister before it was closed.
When next I checked my email I found Steve had closed the loophole!  Lucky
thing too.  While I wouldn't have forged mail headers, I can assure you that
I would have gone for much more personal gain than Steve.
