You're asking the wrong person. The CotC only publishes Appellate
Orders. E does not execute them. See R1805.

He holds two highly paid Offices: Herald and Accountor.

However, I think Michael's payment of my Distributor Salary may have
pushed us all over the tax threshhold, so Crito, along with everyone
else, will now lose some fraction of his large holdings. This is the
down side of Monthly Salaries.

Declaring Presence does not satisfy the Duty to Vote.

>What do people think?

After a quick scan of the rules, I can find nothing that defines the adverb
"publically" to be equivalent to "via the Public Forum", so that I think it
retains its natural meaning.  IMO, voting in a-d is allowed when
unrestricted, as long as the Assessor gets the message.

--Crito

PS. There is one other Rule that uses the word "publically" - R1579
says Recordkeepors must publically announce when a Mintor
(and its associated currency) ceases to exist.  This was probably
*meant* to force it to the PF, but I think it fails to do so for the
same reason.

But wait.  You *are* the CotC, correct?  I wasn't asking you to execute
the orders, I was asking you to officially publish them so that they may
be executed.  Maybe I missed it, but I never saw any such publication
from the CotC's office for either set of Appellate Orders.
