Because Rule 869 provides the mechanism for becoming Registered:
you have to send a message to the Public Forum. There's nothing
in Rule 103 that suggests that Morendil became Registered in some
other way; R103 goes no further than claiming that Morendil became
a Player.

Haven't done this calculation for a while:

M = 101; N = 1748; r = N-M = 1647
R = 288;

Pr(infection) = 1 - (1 - R/r)^5
              = 0.6175

Somewhat lower than I expected...

I agree with Steve.  The phrase "is registered" is not just an adjective, it is
a verbal construction that implies an action taken by or on behalf of the
Player.  The only action defined by the Rules for being registered is the
sending of a message to the PF.

I agree with you on the likely translation of the first half, but from the
looks of the words in the second helf, I know _I_ don't want to be the 
first one the provide a translation. Do _you_ want to be "stemmemerke av
