That is exactly what my point of view does NOT do. For each Vote, my
position makes its legality AT THE MOMENT IT WAS CAST to be the deciding
factor. It's exactly that the legality of votes in this period are NOT
changed which discerns my (D+7.1) view from the D+7 view.

I don't see what my name is doing here.

Perhaps one should be considering the problem from other angles. What
if the voting period had been changed from seven days to ten days?
Since the problem of retroactivity wouldn't come in, I don't think
there would have be much objection to extending the VP of Proposals
already in the queue. Under the attribute model, that would not be
a correct application of the Rules.

I've been giving some thought to the effects of "Ten Days..."
and here is my analysis, fwiw.

Rule 693

      The prescribed Voting Period for a Proposal is seven days,
      beginning at the time the Proposal is distributed to all
      Players.

It seems to me that a voting period is either an attribute of proposals or a separate nomic entity associated with proposals.  In either case, the duration of a VP is clearly (IMO) a rule defined attribute as well.  I do not think that the end of a VP is itself an event.  Rather, it is a time at which the Rules specify certain events are to occur (e.g. the change in legal status for certain types of messages, the imposition of an obligation to report on the Assessor).

As you can see, I must be a proponent of the Attribute Model.  I don't think anyone would dispute the idea that Rule Changes can and do alter the attributes of entities within the game.  So what do I think are the implications here?

1.  The adoption of "Ten Days..." changed the voting period duration attribute of current and future proposals (or the duration attribute of current and future VPs) to be seven days.

2.  R108 prevents this attribute change from changing the legal significance of any events that occurred prior to the proposal's adoption (i.e. votes cast after seven days but before its adoption would still have been legal votes).

Forgive me, I misunderstood your view.

We don't have to wonder 'what if'; once upon a time, on April 28, 1995
to be exact, the Voting Period *was* changed from 7 days to 10, when
P1564 was adopted. And it's interesting to note that the VPs of the
Proposals distributed along with P1564 (1563-1580) were not extended.
Although that's not quite the same case, of course: you were talking
about Proposals already in the Queue (which of course we didn't have in
1995) which have not been distributed. Furthermore, we might want to
distinguish between the treatment of P1563-1564, and the treatment of
P1565-1580, with the thought that Proposals take effect in numerical
order.

Still, your claim about the attribute model is incorrect. What the
attribute model says is that the length of the VP of a Proposal is
established when it is distributed. If we now were to amend R693 so that
it once again specified a VP of 10 days, of course any Proposals which
were distributed after the amendment was adopted would have VPs of 10
days. Their merely having been in the Queue prior to the adoption of the
amendment is irrelevant.

It's a little hard to tell, but it sounds as though you're defending
Andre's solution. What do you say about votes cast between D+7.1 and
D+10?

Essentially, yes.  After D+7.1, as you put it, the change in attributes of Proposals (or VPs) caused by "Ten Days..." means the voting period for the proposals in question is no longer in effect and no votes can legally be cast on them.

I think I could live with this solution. Chuck and Scott have objected
that this would mean that the Proposals had VPs of neither 7 nor 10
days, but I think there may be game custom to support this. Consider
Promotor Crito's remarks accompanying the distribution of Proposals
3552-3554, distributed on Sep. 22, 1997, while R693 was infected:

The CFJ Crito was referring to was CFJ 944, which was indeed Judged
TRUE; I seem to remember that these Proposals did in fact end up having
a truncated Voting Period, which lasted from the disinfection of R693 on
Sep. 28, until 10 days after the distribution of the Proposals, on Oct.
2. I remember it because I remember being mildly annoyed at the fact
that P3552 (A Public Voting Experiment) failed Quorum due to the short
VP. (I immediately reproposed it; it was redistributed as P3555.) The
Assessor's Report for these Proposals doesn't show this truncated Voting
Period, it is true, but such issues may have been swamped by the first
wave of the Pragmatic Currencies crises which hit just at that time.

>days, but I think there may be game custom to support this.

But this would be a false and misleading conclusion because it conflates
the concept of what *is* a Proposal's VP with what *was* a Proposal's VP.
For example, what *is* the VP of Proposal 3500?  Well, according to the
current Rule set, it's seven days from the time of the proposal's distribution
(which is just an historical period of time that has no legal consequences).
But, of course, before the passage of "Ten Days...' the VP of Proposal 3500
*was* ten days from the time of its distribution.

 So you see, at no time did the proposals in question ever have a VP that was
other than seven or ten days in duration.  It's just that, because the duration of
the VP changed from one day to the next, the period of time in which votes
could legally be cast was of an intermediate duration.  Note that "Voting Period",
because of the way it is defined, is *not* required to be logically equivalent to
"the period of time in which votes may legally be cast".  Of course, the two
*will* be logically equivalent as long as the definition of a particular VP does
not change during its course.

This is not in the format specified by Rule 1753.  Now what happens?

I think you have to admit that it's pretty wacky to claim that the
effect of the passage of P3809 is to make it the case that every single
Proposal in the history of the game should now be said to have (present
tense) a Voting Period of 7 days. When I ask the question "how long was
the Voting Period of P3552?" (which I was asking myself just this
morning), I don't expect to get the answer back: "do you mean 'how long
was it before the passage of P3809?' or 'how long was it after the
passage of P3809?'" I just want you tell me how much time there was
between the actual historical beginning and end of the VP of the
Proposal.

On the other hand, I can see why you are forced into saying such wacky
things: it's a direct result of viewing R693 merely as attaching a
designation to an historical period of time, rather than the more
sensible view (as I see things), that it acts to specify when certain
events - the beginning and end of the VP - occur.
