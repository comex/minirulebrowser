Hi all,

Here is another attempt to reduce the number of POs and TOs around. 

>>
Amend R1442 to read:

      Every vote cast on a proposal has a voting cost, equal to 
      the Voting Tariff at the time the proposal was distributed. 
      The voting cost of a particular vote is unbilled if it has 
      not been billed yet.

      As soon as possible after the beginning of each month, the 
      Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity a number of Voting 
      Tokens equal to the overall unbilled voting cost of all votes
      cast on Proposals by that entity in the past month. 
<<

I tried to check whether changes are needed in other rules that
interact with the timing of these Voting bills, but I don't think
there are any such rules.

Denial of voting privileges (R1825) still works as written, there may
just be times when it is more or less likely that players are denied
this privilege.

Concerning R1863 (Duty to vote) we might either insert a clause that
the number of "effectively controlled" VTs is the number of VTs owned
minus the unbilled voting cost of votes already cast in that month, or
should we leave it to the courts to establish that this is just what
"effective control" means? I'd favor the latter.

One might try and bunch the Duty to Vote penalties together into
monthly bills, too, but that conflicts with the gereal infraction and
penalty framework, so I'd rather not change this.

...

While this does reduce the number of TOs, it really doesn't decrease 
the amount of PO recordkeeping. It just transfers the work from the 
Accountor to the Assessor. Someone still has to keep track of all those
voting debts.

This doesn't mean I am opposed to the change, just that I would like 
to see a small pay rise for the Assessor included in the Proposal, to
compensate em for the additional work.
