To tell you the truth, I'm not so sure myself.  8)

I've held multiple offices for a while, and I've been somewhat sparing
with my votes (no more than one per proposal), but that's about it.

--Crito

I just though that this might be more interesting than only being able 
to change priorities only once every week.  So here comes the revamped 
proto.


Protoposal  "Limited Priority Changes"

Create a new rule titled "Limited Priority Changes" with the following 
text.

A player may only change the priority of a proposal once.  If a player 
has already changed the priority of a proposal e shall not change the 
priority of that proposal again.


[Notes: 

Changed an increase to simply a change in priority, and changed week 
to eternity. Also now a new rule rather than just an amendment.]

Here is another idea that might be interesting, however there are 
still big holes in the thing, so any advice would be useful. 

(Other than "That's a crap idea, give it up." Or such like, I don't 
want any advice like that.  Only nice, happy, friendly advice, 
preferably saying that you like the idea and that everybody should 
vote for it if it ever get distributed...  Well maybe not, actual 
constructive advice that would be of some real use would be better 
even if it did slag off the proposal.  But enough about my 
indecisiveness -or maybe not it depends on your point of view really- 
Time for me to get on with the actual proto, which would be the part 
of this message that you would be interested in and not all this 
gibberish which I have just written.)


Protoposal,  "The Treasurer"


Create a rule titled "The Treasurer" with the following text

There exists the office of Treasurer.

There are elections for the office of Treasurer every quarter.  This 
is the only time at which there can be elections for the office of 
Treasurer.  Candidates for the office of Treasurer must post a valid 
Protobudget  to a public forum at least one week before the start of 
the quarter in which they are standing for election, or they will not 
be eligible for the election.
Any player that posts a valid Protobudget is a candidate for the 
office of Treasurer.  

A Candidates Protobudget should contain all the information that is 
required to be in a Treasurer's Budget.  However, if the Candidates 
Protobudget does not contain any of the above information, then it 
shall be taken that in regards to the missing information the 
candidates Protobudget is the same as the last Treasurer's budget.  A 
Candidates Protobudget is only valid if it is posted to a public forum 
at least one week before the start of the quarter in which they are 
standing for election.

A Candidate may amend their Protobudget by posting an amended version 
to a public forum at least one week before the start of the quarter in 
which they are standing for election.  If the amended Protobudget is 
posted with in one week of the beginning of the new quarter it is not 
valid.

As soon as possible after the election of a candidate to the office of 
Treasurer the candidate's Protobudget becomes the Treasurer's budget, 
and shall be posted to a public forum by

If there are no candidates for the office of Treasurer or no one is 
elected to the office of Treasurer.  The Treasurer's budget shall 
remain the same as in the previous quarter.

The Treasurer does not receive a monthly salary but instead receives a 
payment of VTs as set in the Treasurer's budget as soon as possible 
after e is elected.



Create a rule titled "The Treasurer's Budget" with the following text.

The Treasurer's Budget shall include the following: 

(1) The salary of every officer that receives a monthly wage.
(2) The unemployment benefit.

I don't really see the point of a Treasurer; it's just centralizing the
person who fiddles with all the number in the Agoran economy. If the budget
also included taxes to balance it, then we could have some interesting
developments.

Just a note to say that I got this, but I am not sure whether it is valid.

Rule 1764 says, in part:

           (3) If the mode of voting is Unrestricted, then any other
               Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
               any votes, or the declaration of Presence, by Voting
               Entities on that Proposal, Election or Referendum, may
               be achieved by sending a message either publically or
               privately.

In the context of the rule "publically" could be construed as meaning
"via the Public Forum", which this post clearly isn't. And it certainly
wasn't sent "privately". 

What do people think?
