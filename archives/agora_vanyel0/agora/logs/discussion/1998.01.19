I don't see any reason why it should be disHonorable for the Notary to
assign Trustees at random, if that is what he is doing.

It might however be wise of Murphy to make an official selection Policy.

I agree that the OR mechanism isn't very extendible.  On the other
hand, it does do what it's supposed to pretty well.  Rather than
trying to reform that as well as Proposal distribution, perhaps just
add a new rule along the lines of:
 
"If an Officer fails to fulfil a duty required of them by the rules,
 and is not otherwise penalised for it, they shall have committed the
 Infraction of Official Negligence, which can be detected and reported
 by any Player."

I would welcome such a rule, but I think it might also be a good idea to
tie it in to the Dereliction of Duty rule (1644) so that continued 
negligence results in removal from office.

I am tempted to make a CFJ stating that the rules do not require Officers
to play catch-up, but I suspect that existing game custom goes against me.
Maybe I can phrase it so that game custom is irrelevant. Hsm.
