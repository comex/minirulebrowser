No, no, no! 'More Fun with Priority' was the Proposal you
were *meant* to distribute. 'The Levers of Monetary Policy'
has *already* been distributed as P3747, and was no longer
in the Queue at the time of the last distribution.

How about "Their blood has washed out of of their foul footsteps'

There have been attempts to get the anthem changed to a song more sappily
patriotic, and less, um, violent, along the lines of "America the
Beautiful," but with little success.

Seems to me this in parts both vacuuous and overbroad. Due to Rule
1794, one cannot issue an Order that is not of a type explicitly
defined in the Rules; any Order is by definition of one of the four
types listed in 1794. As to attempting to restrict Players to only
submit Orders the Rules "specifically empower em to execute", I bring
to your attention that nowhere do the Rules specifically empower any
Player to execute Transfer Orders. Nor do I think they need to,
however; issuing an Order is a voluntary act, so the Rules cannot
"empower" anyone to do so, or in fact prevent them from doing so.
If anything, the second part therefore attempts to bar all Players
from issuing any kind of Order at all.

The Order Rules make a specific disticntion between class and type.
1794 defines classes of Orders, not types.  Types, in the context
of the order rules, refers to the specific instances of these
classes, ie.  Transfer Orders, Orders to Annotate &c.

Anyone can break the rules if they want to, but to do so, to avoid
a legally imposed situation just because they feel it is unpleasant, is
un-Agoran and, I think, damaging to the spirit of the game.

Shall we all just decide to obey the Rules we *like* now?
Shall we all go willy-nilly commiting such crimes that we
all feel are unjustly defined in the rules?  Is it anarchy
we want here now?  Lawless hordes roming the vitual streets...
</rant>

Seriously, disobeying a valid Order *is* a crime.  Are you seriously
suggesting that the Agora public start commiting criminal acts just to
avoid the consequences of a scam?  I think that's a very bad
precident.

I don't know much of the text, but I have heard some rumors that the
French national anthem (la Marseillaise) is even more violent.  There was
some reaction when they had a little girl sing it during the Albertville
Olympic winter games - someone noticed that it was not exactly appropriate
for children... :-)

<NRA> That would be a violation of the Second Amendment. </NRA>

DIS: Re: BUS: COE on Promotor's Report

has *already* been distributed as P3747, and was no longer
in the Queue at the time of the last distribution.

A rather simple rebuttal : shouldn't "in any way" be interpreted
such as to include "directly or indirectly" ? The 'effect' of an
Order prohibiting a Player from appealing a second Order which,
coincidentally, prohibits the same Player from appealing the first
Order is precisely as described in 1796, after all. A suitably broad
interpretation of 1796 would mandate that one of the two Orders is 
invalid due to the quoted provision. Since we have no precedent in
this matter, there's no clear reason not to favor that 
interpretation.

OTOH, someone might do it 'for the greater good', and throw emself
on the mercy of the Court citing mitigating circumstances. Possibly
deregister a while later to go live down the shame elsewhere. Who
knows ?

The same problem applies to any Scam that relies on the expectation
that every Player except for the Scamster will remain a law-abiding
citizen rather than interfere with the scheme.

On the other hand, a more specific answer is the following excerpt
from R1811 :

      This Rule shall have no application with respect to any Order
      which has been adjudicated to be invalid, and the invalidity of
      the Order is a complete defense to a Criminal accusation made
      under this Rule.

Thus, if the Orders you have submitted are indeed invalid, then not 
abiding by them is not a criminal act. In particular, if it is required
to disobey one or more such Orders before it can be properly 
established that they were indeed invalid, that is not a problem.

I don't see this distinction made anywhere else than in R1796. Other
than this mention, the notion of an order's "type" does not appear
elsewhere in the Ruleset; it is ill-defined enough to warrant the
interpretation that an order's "type" and an order's "class" are one
and the same.

What you meant to write, I suppose, was "a species of Order
explicitly characterized by the Rules", such as a Transfer Order.

Merely a detail, though - I'm more concerned by the fact that you've
(at least temporarily) outlawed Transfer Orders and Payment orders.

Again, is this a good precident?  Is the knowing commision of a
Crime ever *for the greater good*?  Should it be excusable to
engage in Criminal activity to explicitly avoid the legal, non-
Criminal actions of another Player?

I resent the implication that I am not a law-abiding player.  Everything
I have done is perfectly legal, permissible and valid given the
current state of the Rules.  You are arguing that it is valid for
someone to engage in a Crime to avoid a Scam that is, in itself legal.

That would be akin for me to refuse, in my capacity as Scorekeepor,
to record a 100 point scam that happened a short time ago simply
because I believed that the Scam was somehow morally wrong.  That
would have been a Crime, and I think the same category of action
you are advocating.  After all, nothing in the Rules *prevents* the
Scorekeepor (or anyone) from commiting such arbitrary and illegal
actions as are within their capability.  Do you argue-- barring passage
of the electioneering proposal in the queue-- that it would be 
excusable for the Assessor to electoneer a scam proposal that e
thought was pwersonally aggregious?

I am trusting that Agorans are a law-abiding people and will limit
themselves-- as General Chaos has-- to attempting to fight this Coup
with remedies permitted em by the Rules.  Acting within the law is
honorable, acting without it is not.  If it suddenly becomes a
legitimate move to commit such Crimes as one feels like, then we have
abandoned the rule of law and have decided to abandon the game in
favor of a free-for-all.

However, it is in the nature of Orders that they *are* binding until
they are vacated.  This clause is, in fact, why I was so timely
with my CFJ.  It is also why the first Orders were confined to
deny people the right to issue similar Orders.  There's a catch 22
for anyone wishing to exploit this--

If my Orders are ajudicated invalid, the same reasoning will apply to
any similar order, and defying my order will only suceed in issuing
a similarly invalid order.

If my Orders are ajudicated valid, then, not only is defying them a
crime, but will only result in an issuance of an Order that would still
be invalid due to the "curcumstances" clause of 1796.

Therfore, no Player-- other than myself-- can now issue a valid
arbitrary private Order, Q.E.D.

You are right, if the Orders are invalid, disobeying them is not
a Crime.  But if they're invalid there's no scam, and defying them
would be pointless.

Swann

PS-Needless to say, if the Orders are valid, then all similar
subsequent Orders by myself will be similarly valid and criminal to
disobey, by the same reasoning.  I defer such orders until the CFJ's
are properly ajudicated.  (Unless promted to action to preserve the
scam:) In the same light as I see Agoran's rightfully persuing all
legal means to deny me this power grab, I reserve the right to
persue all legal means to defend this Coup and bring it to
fruition.)

I think that the distiction in 1796 is quite enough.  The fact that
"class" is an explicitly defined term in 1794, and 1796 make a
distinction between class and type, is enough to define "type" as
the more restrictive term refering to individual cases, a language
that's used in other places in the Rules such as Applications.  The fact
that 1796 says "class and type" rather than just "class" or just
"type" is, IMO forcing the distinction that class is not equal to type.
Enforcing a synomity between the terms I think is forcing a nonsensical
interpretation on 1796.

Why would this term not be synonomyous with the terms "class and type?"
I don't see how your phrasology is more precise.

If this is a problem it is easily dealt with by amending the original
orders.  I will probably do so just so this scam doesn't get mired in a
side issue that doesn't address the central point.

As soon as we began to define penalties for breaking the Rules, and
in doing so acknowledged that the mere fact of being a Rule might be
an insufficient deterrent to its being broken, we introduced the
possibility that Players might deliberately and strategically break
the Rules, if they were prepared to wear whatever penalties the Rules
defined. For myself, I have never been clear as to what attitude I
should take to such a Player. I can see both sides. On the one hand,
if Electioneering is against the Rules, then that should be reason
enough for an Assessor not to Electioneer even if there is no penalty.
And certainly that is the principle that has guided me in the
performance of my duties as Assessor. But then, why make Electioneering
a Class C Crime? If I judge that some particular act of Electioneering
is worth sucking a 4 VT + 4 Blot penalty for (not to mention the political
opprobrium which doubtless would ensue), then isn't that a legitimate
strategic decision I can make? If it's really so important to us to
stop Electioneering, and if we're going to use penalties as deterrents,
then it's up to us to make the deterrents plausible, say suspension of
voting rights or even temporary deregistration. If they're not, then
isn't that just a loophole and therefore a legitimate target of a scam?
As I say, it's a thorny question and I don't think there are any obvious
and easy answers to it.

Well, this raises all kinds of interesting questions. For one thing,
the Voting Periods for Proposals 3747-3748 have just concluded a
few hours ago. As a result, several Rules (eg R1442) trigger asap
obligations on me as Assessor to issue Payment Orders for Voting
and so on. So, assuming your Orders are valid, they appear to
conflict with the requirements of other Rules, with consequences
that are unclear to me at this very late hour, but which probably
depend on the precedence of whichever Rules are the source of 
whatever authority your Orders have.

But secondly, your last remark begs what seems to me to be an
important question: what are the ultimate aims of this Coup D'Etat?
What is it that you want?

Yup. There's probably a great deal of literature on the subject, and
relevant references will probably be quoted by better minds than I,
but I hold it for self-evident that a citizen must be prepared to
disregard the law if abiding by it would be a morally worse course
of action. E.g., the actions of so-called "freedom fighters" under
most totalitarian regimes. I'm not saying your own Scam justifies
such a radical position; but I do think that there are circumstances
under which actions defined as criminal are morally justified.

I'm implying nothing of the sort; nothing you've done so far is
currently punishable by law, althuogh of course the eventual outcome
will set some precedent as to that. I'm merely pointing out that the 
successful execution of a Scam of that sort requires that no Player 
commit a currently unlawful act, something that can't be relied on,
because Players are entities with free will.

My point, I guess, is that by arbitrarily classifying some actions as
"illegal" which were formerly legal, by a process which may appear
legal, but is nevertheless severely at odds with our democratic
traditions, you are making it easier for Players to perceive the 
resulting game state as one in which such actions are nevertheless
morally justified. Marginally easier, because you've exercised
commendable restraint, but nevertheless.

Let's be clear that there is a "game vs. meta-game" issue involved
here; discussions of morality should not enter into considerations
which apply purely to the mechanics of the game. The whole point of
the Crimes/Infractions framework is that the Rules have no power to
physically compel Players to perform, or refrain from performing,
some actions; they merely specify consequences of such actions or
inactions. From a purely mechanistic point of view, there's no
difference between the fact that being Elected to Office results in
my gaining Points, and the fact that failing to Judge in time
results in my gaining Blots.

However, we are not limited to a strictly mechanistic view of the 
Rules, and we do recognize some actions as being morally wrong.
But for exactly the same reason that an action is not morally 
excusable just because the Rules have no power to prevent Players 
from performing it, an action is not morally excusable just because 
the Rules, directly or indirectly, authorize a Player to perform it.
That said, again I'm not passing judgement on your own Scam -
it's well within the bounds of reason, and I've done worse myself. ;)

I don't think the two are remotely similar. I can't honestly claim to
believe that it is legal for a Scorekeeport to refuse to record a
Score change; but I can (and in fact I do) believe that it is legal
for me to Appeal any of the Orders you've placed me under an Order
not to Appeal, because Calling for Judgement is a right granted to
me by the Rules (Rule 911, to be precise) which I don't believe you 
can deprive me of. (If anywhere, I think that's where the Scam's 
fatal flaw lies; there's no reason to interpret the Rules as giving 
Orders more power than themselves.)

> If my Orders are ajudicated invalid, the same reasoning will apply to

But not, however, a properly issued Judicial Order. So, take your
Orders denying Players the right to Appeal them : if I decide to take
the risk and Appeal these Orders, the Judge might rule them invalid,
and in such circumstances I would be - legally - entirely safe from
Criminal prosecution . Now, if I was intimately convinced that these
Orders were indeed invalid, from my point of view at least Appealing
them would certainly be morally excusable, wouldn't it ?

The above notwithstanding, I certainly agree that it would be more
elegant to defeat the Scam on its own failings, or let it succeed on
its own merits. But that's a purely aesthetical view. ;)

Hmm, that's probably correct - amend that to "a species of Order
(other than classes of Orders as defined in Rule X) explicitly
characterized by the Rules".

Well, I've amended the Orders so that its clearer what they prohibit,
so I don't think they criminalize your duties (if they ever did,
which I dispute, but that's an issue which is *so* beside the point I
thought it more reasonable to amend the orders then start arguing
about it.)

My main intent here is twofold.

First, I obviously want some recognition.  At least a win, and possibly
a Patent Title and an Official Holiday in recognition of the Coup.

Second, I want to (in the same proposal as above) amend the order rules
to prevent such a Coup as mine from happening again.  It may only be
a matter of adding a rule explicitly invalidating any Order not of a
type explicitly defined in the rules.  Also a rule explicitly
invalidating *all* Orders that direct Judicial actions.  There are
probably a few other nits I'd address.  I'll admit, somewhat shamedly,
that I haven't drafted the proposal yet.  I was working on this scam,
waiting for the "proper moment"  when suddenly, a question was asked--
by Oerjan I think-- about Transfer Orders that came perilously close to
the ground I tread with this scam.  To me the loophole was so
self-evident that I was in an immediate panic about anyone closely
examining the Rules in question and beating me to the punch.  So I
executed this a little bit before I intended to.

I most vigorously do not want to permanently change Agora into a version
of Fascist.  Nor to I want to compel any players beyond the issues I
outlined above, or beyond what is needed to execute the scam itself.

To the fearful I would like to outline what I (or anyone first to
utilize this loophole) *could* have done, but refrained from doing:

i) I could have ordered everyone to give me their currency.
ii) I could have ordered the Chancellor to transfer me all the
    currency in the bank.
iii) I could have ordered all Offices delegated to me, and then order
the Speaker to resign.
iv) I could have ordered everyone to deregister.
v) I could have ordereed everyone to decline to judge the CFJs I called.

In fact, the amount of damage such ill thought orders could do to the
game is incalculable.  I wish it to be taken as a sign of my good faith,
and of my intent to do no harm, that I have not, and will not, issue
such orders.  I do not wish to damage the game.  

I know I am the only one who knows my own heart.  And I can only assert
my benign intentions.  But please understand that, upon seeing a
loophole granting someone absolute power, I was honor bound to exploit
it, for that is the only case where *I* could be certain that it would
be exploited benignly.

One point worth mentioning is that by the very nature of our current
system of penalties, Players will not be uniformly affected by identical
deterrents. A 3-Blot penalty might mean little to a Player with 9 
indulgences, or a 4-VT penalty to a VT-rich Player. Currently, our 
only 'democratic' penalty is suspension of voting rights. This is 
certainly going to have some incidence on whether a particular Player 
considers a prohibition enforced by Currency penalties 'morally
inescapable' or merely 'inconvenient'.

It's possible (though I judge it unlikely) that precedence does not 
enter into it. One way of looking at the situation is that we have a 
Rule that specifies a penalty for your issuing such POs, as well as a 
Rule that specifies a penalty for your not issuing them; damned if 
you do, damned if you don't. (Unless Swann's recent amendments
to his own Orders makes it legal for you to issue such POs, in whic 
case this will have been a merely theoretical point. All the same, if 
I were you I'd feel slightly miffed at having to decide on the issue 
before you can safely carry out the duties the Rules require of you.)

I grant your point as far as RL is concerned.  I, however am talking
about in-game actions here.  Just because the Rules admit the
possibility of a Rule being broken doesn't make it permissible as far as
the Rules are concerned.  We are engaged in Agora to play by the Rules,
and if we admit that game actions that are illegal by the Rules are
still, in some circumstances, permissible to do, I think we have done
ourselves a greater injury than my scam would ever do.

I see no practical difference between disobeying a rule that says, "A
player shall not..." and disobeying a Rule that says "A Player commits a
Crime if e..."

I think, in the history of Agora, it has never been acceptable to
knowingly engage in a Criminal act.  I don't think it is now.

I'm sorry if I misinterpreted you.  I really have tried to execute this
scam in a legal and just manner.

In the same light, we cannot rely on any Player obeying the Rules of
Agora in general.  Somehow, except for oversights and accidents, the
players seem to do so.  I expect them to continue to do so, and I would
hope that responsible players would encourage them to.

True, insofar as such a far-reaching scam is going to inspire some ill
will.  I have tried to learn something from the mousetrap scam.  I am
trying to do all of this in public, singling out no particular player,
and being direct in what I believe I am doing and what I intend to do. 
I might point out that, while the moustrap scam inspired the most heated
and inflamed rhetoric of any other in recent memory, it is my belief
that no single player advocated breaking the rules as a reasonable
option to pursue in the fight against *that* scam-- a scam whose scope
and effect almost exactly parallels my own.

Even talking in these purely mechanistic terms, I believe that there is
a strong Game Custom that equates a "criminal act" to be one that
"breaks the rules."  There is, IMO, no such Custom in regard to
Infractions.  Both of these are effects of the origins of these two
processes, whose nature and effects have not changed even while their
language has been-- perhaps overly-- pragmitized.

There's the difference.  If there is a legitimate legal argument for the
case you state above, I see no problem with it.  My objection is to
someone saying, "I don't give a &^%$* if it's a valid Order, I'm defying
it."

I also think your own CFJ is a pretty good response to the scam.  It
doesn't completely hobble the Coup, but it does put some restraints on
its power.  (IMO, if the reasoning is valid, the segments of my Orders
dealing with appeals would be voided, but the remaining language would
remain in force.)  It does give a neat shorthand for determining the
validity of my Orders-- i.e. would a Power=1 Rule saying the same thing,
numbered 9999 and with no precedence clause, be effective?

In light of your CFJ, I'll try and restrict future Orders to conform to
that formula.

I don't think so.  Given the above construction, I think it is
permissible for our hypothetical Power=1 Rule to specify the action of
the Judge, if not the act of calling a CFJ.

I must also say, while I'm impressed with your response, I am not
completely convinced that it applies exactly how you believe it does.

I certainly agree with you there, though I suppose that's no surprise.

Now *that* would be an interesting project. ;) Actually, that's one
of the more fascinating sub-goals of Nomic games that don't actually
start out like Fascist, i.e. to see whether one person (or a small
subset of the playerhood) can grab absolute power. (The interest of 
Fascist-type Nomics being exactly the reverse, i.e. can the player(s) 
holding absolute power hold it indefinitely while allowing the game
to run at a normal pace.)

Well, the point of Orders is that all Players could do so - and, in
fact, *can* still do so. Right at this moment I could order you,
Swann, to deregister within one day and refrain from registering
again in the next month; no one can physically prevent me from
posting a message to the PF that happens to be an Order.

To be sure, due to your elaborate precautions, I would (possibly) be
committing a Criminal act, but - by your own reasoning - so would
you, if you didn't comply. Given your stated position on the 'moral'
issues, I (and possibly other Players) would expect you to be a
law-abiding citizen and comply; we could then sort it out among 
ourselves, and I'd take whatever penalty is coming to me, comforted 
by the though of having saved Agora from a horrible tyranny. (This is 
the practical illustration of the moral position I was advocating a 
few posts ago.)

In other words, your notion of this loophole granting anyone absolute
power is demonstrably wrong; the worst you can do is foster the kind
of 'free-for-all' you indicate you are concerned about.

The crux at this point is that I believe that 1796 renders any Order
issued in violation of a valid Order invalid.  The "circumstances"
1796 refers to are different for you in this case than it is for me.
Innitally issuing my Orders, I was under no prohibitions, thus 1796
defines the resulting Orders valid.  When you issue the hypothetical
Order above, you are operating under (we'll presume) a prohibition
imposed by a valid Order, and it is thus invalid by 1796.  As you point
out it is no Crime to disobey an invalid Order.

At this point I believe that an arbatrary Order is no longer
"permitted in the circumstances" that exist for every Player other than
myself.  Any such Orders issued, IMHO, are not only Criminal, but
also invalid.

Ah, but this was the whole point of the (now hopefully obsolete)
Platonist vs. Pragmatist debate ! (Or, at least, one axis of it).
The class of actions that Player cannot be physically restrained from
performing, or compelled to perform, is well identified : it consists
of posting messages to the PF. Any "Moves" that are in fact legal
fictions can be "prohibited" by adjusting the conditions under which
these actions are "deemed legal" : e.g., "A Player may not legally
perform more than two Kudo Transfers per Week", or "A Player may not
transfer more Currencies than e has".

Parallelism is not identity. ;) Your own attempt strikes much closer
to the very definition of "legal" and "illegal" in Agoran terms,
which is why we're having this fascinating exchange; personally, I
won't be turning rogue to defeat it unless you do turn out Fascist, 
but I wanted to point out why that might look like a defendable 
option in some alternate scenarios.

I disagree with these statements.  There has always been a strong
separation between Crimes and Rule breaking. 

At no time that I can remember have the Rules prohibited Crimes, only
punished them. Therefore, I have no problems committing them, in
principle.  (Notwithstanding that penalties and bad consequences for the
game may make specific Crimes a bad idea.)

However, I will not willfully break the Rules.  If it should come to such
a point that obeying them becomes intolerable, I will instead use Rule
113.

So, there is at least one Player here for whom the penalties are much less
important than what the Rules actually say.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

I don't think so. The first paragraph clearly refers only to the
Rules; the presumption of validity applies to "All Orders executed in
the manner prescribed by the Rules". The 'circumstances' language
only sets out guidelines for Judicial evaluation.

Looks to me as if you're confusing the Rules' 'presumption of
validity' with a Court-assessed 'claim to validity'. An Order may be
presumed valid but be later declared invalid, which is what 1796
specifies. The point of establishing 'simple' criteria for a
presumption of validity is precisely that we can know, relatively
fast, which Orders should be considered binding until a CFJ is
called.

To put it another way, the above Order of mine could be phrased "I
hereby Order Swann to Deregister within one day, and I hereby Order
all Players to refrain from Appealing Order II (Order II is to Order
all Players to refrain from appealing this Order)". Now, no CFJ can 
question the validity of this order, so the 'circumstances' clause 
cannot enter into play, so it should be considered binding purely
because it's presumably valid.

I think this is an ill-conceived approach; the solution is better
acquired by a better definition of validity (which I had in mind to do
but never got to) and by clearly hierarchicalizing Orders (Appelate
being superior to Judicial, Judicial to Administrative, and
Administrative to Private), which I had intended to do but forgot to
make explicit.  "Categorizing" orders is stultifying and ultimately
ties the hands of those who have to issue orders, rendering the
mechanism useless for what I view as its primary intended purpose:
judicial remediation.  Since proper remediation is almost inherently a
case-by-case question, trying to lay down narrow categories of proper
orders is, in my opinion, contrary to this inherent useful purpose,
and I will oppose it.

Steven> Also a rule explicitly invalidating *all* Orders that direct

Appelate Orders, and certain Administrative Orders issued by the Clerk
of the Courts, must be able to affect Judicial Orders for the appeals
process to function.

However, note that your orders would likely have been ignored.

I do not think so, and if some separation exists I believe it is
a pragmatist contrivance to make the rules explicitly admit that
players have agency independent of them.  If is a fact that committing
a Crime is not in fact breaking the Rules-- and I don't yet admit that
the game has reached, IMHO, such a sorry state-- then I believe that
every single rule defining a Crime, and perhaps the concept of Crime
itself, should be abolished and the rules redrafted to once again make
these actions "against the rules."

Or, perhaps, and amendment of Rule 101 is needed;

"All Players must always abide by all the Rules then in effect, in the
form in which they are then in effect.  If the Rules define an act, or
failure to act, as a Crime, then committing such an act is not abiding
by the Rules."

I have to admit that I find this train of reasoning re: Crimes
disturbing in the extreme.

My only appeal to someone who believes thus is that if it was generally
held that the only reason not to engage in the strategic commission of
Crimes was the inconvenient penalties they might impose, it opens a
pandora's box that is not easily again closed.  If we begin to weigh the
option of criminal actions based solely on their cost in a few units of
currency, we have essentially destroyed the ability of the Rules to
restrain the Player's action.

Again, I cannot see how willfully committing a Crime is *not* willfully
breaking the rules.  At the very least, I think it is close enough to
breaking the Rules that I would not willfully do it.  The line is close
enough that, even if the two aren't equivalent-- I've been on the wrong
end of interpretations before I'll admit-- I would venture to assert
that if willfully committing a Crime becomes accepted, it is not a far
distance until willfully violating the Rules is also acceptable.  I do
not wish to see the game head in that direction, it would be doing Agora
a great disservice.

You may have a point about the presumption of validity there, despite
the fact that proper adjudication would render such an order invalid.
Faced with such an order I would probably deregister, and *then* call a
CFJ, based on the fact that the Rules aren't binding on a non-Player. 
The Orders I made would remain in force, and eventually the Criminal
Order would be adjudicated invalid, at which point-- as soon as the
Rules allow-- I'd re-register and resume my business.

PS-- I don't think the above steps are necessary for the current
Playership, I don't believe my actions require such drastic steps.  If
anyone feels I am overstepping beyond what is required to perpetrate the
scam and achieve the goals I outlined in a prior post, please tell me
and I will attempt to accommodate you.

I am interested in hearing your specific thoughts on the matter.  I
actually respect the order rules, and you as their primary drafter (the
only reason I barred you from the CFJ was because I felt it might be
clearer in your mind what the Order Rules *intended* to say, rather than
the implications of what they do say.)  If you have in mind a preferable
approach, let me hear it.

I can see where that was where the Rules were heading.  That is a very
good idea, which coinsides with tightening the restrictions on the more
powerful orders.

I can see what you're saying. And I think what you said about tightening
the definition of validity is very close to what I have in mind myself.
When I draft the loophole fix, be certian I will solicit your opinion of
it.

Pardon, I should have said arbitrary Orders.

Again, that is a meta-game issue.  It would be possible to issue such a
set of orders to cause the Playership to "reboot" automatically, so to
speak--ignoring the Orders as something "outside" the game they're now
playing.  This seems to be a common response other nomics have to
crises, simply restart the game with the same ruleset, minus the
problem.  Agorans, I believe, will want to resolve the problem within
the game as far as it is possible.

What you said is indeed possible, but that wouldn't render the Orders
moot or ineffective.  CFJs alleging criminal acts would inevitably
follow from one as evil as to submit such orders, and it would be
possible, simply from a suffusion of Blots on the unfortunate Players so
condemned, to deregister everyone except the evil person who commited
this plot.  Such evil need not travel all the way to its conclusion for
it to irreprably harm the game.  Imagine the kind of acidic rhetoric and
vutupritive recriminations that would follow such an episode. . .

I intend to avoid such a catastrophe.
I urge calm.

That presumtive validity, at least in the case of private orders not
defined in the Rules, may be a bug.

The game started at that "sorry state"  when Crimes were originally
defined.

Crimes and Infractions were invented as ways to discourage actions without
prohibiting them, thus allowing them to be done if the perpetrator was
willing to take the consequences.

You have to remember that in the initial Platonic climate, an action which
was prohibited usually didn't happen at all.  You had to permit things
before you could penalize them.  This came in addition to the fact that
Players did not (and still do not) willfully break the Rules.


This separation has rarely been a problem.  Witness Electioneering,
customarily one of our most strongly discouraged actions:  The Rule
contains _both_ a prohibition and a Crime designation.  This is
flexibility.

I agree that there might be a problem if Rules are crafted without an
understanding of these issues, and your idea to make Crimes explicitly
prohibited is a good one.  After all, we already have two tiers through
the difference between Crimes and Infractions.

Also, I am always in favor of legislation that makes different Players'
interpretations agree what the game is.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

I will note for the record that Rule 116 permits almost everything.

This sentence does not parse ("To be proven valid, the Rules must X,
that Y, and that Z"). Swann, if you're going to fix the Rule, please
fix the grammar as well. ;)

My feelings-- obviously-- are different.  It is my feeling that Crimes
were instituted to prohibit action where the Rules could not physically
prevent a Player from committing such an action, and that Infractions
were intended to be mere "discouragement."

This is, IMHO, just a rule that the rabid pragmatists haven't gotten
their hands on yet :)  I believe that Crimes, initially, were all of the
"electioneering" type-- prohibition *and* penalty.  It is only over the
course of time that there have been pragmatic arguments that it is
non-sensical to have the Rules prohibit *any* action made by a
free-willed Player.  Until now I have accepted and supported such a
pragmatic approach, but if what you say is true, and that Crimes have
shied away from their phohibitionary role-- or indeed, if you are
correct an they never held such a role-- and are now mere penalties,
then I think we have lost much, much more with the Pragmatic approach
than we have ever gained.

At least, in this, we agree :)

Heh.  I was wondering how long before this loophole in Swann's
loophole would be exploited. :)
