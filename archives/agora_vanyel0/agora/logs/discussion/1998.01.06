My solution would be to set a minimum number of Plots one must own to Win
by Ownership -- i.e., "Any entity who Owns all Plots not owned by the Bank
Wins by Ownership if e owns 5 or more Plots."

I found another mistake in Plots v2.3:

>Create a Rule entitled "Types of Structures" with this text:

...

One of these Rules should have its title changed...

Not really. I'm voting against it for now, and most likely it'll
fail, what with Swann voting 2A and all, but you shouldn't take that
as indicating that the Proposal is without merit. I'd just like to
see its merits properly discussed before we adopt it.

I think it's not completely clear how we should interpret the provision
in R1729 that if "no one Votes FOR it, the Proposer shall Win". One could
interpret this as referring to votes received, or one could interpret it
as referring to votes ultimately tallied. Personally, I prefer the latter
interpretation as being more in the spirit of the Rule, and I tend to think
that this is game custom, too: the Wins achieved by Andre, Morendil and
myself were recognized after it became clear that the vote *tallies*
were incorrect, even though voting messages were still received.

I do think it's pretty clear that the provision in R1729 that no Player
shall vote in public refers to the act of voting, ie sending a certain
kind of message to the Public Forum. This act cannot be rescinded by
retracting the votes contained in such a message.

I'd say that you may be trying to split hairs *too* finely. Rule 1729
("Insanity") says, in part, "...If no one votes FOR it, the Proposer shall
Win." Several other Rules, including Rule 955 ("Votes Required to Adopt a
Proposal") and Rule 833 ("Awards & Penalties for Proposals") define things
in terms of "Votes received" for a Proposal. I would say that the phrase in
Rule 1729 does not count cancelled votes FOR for the same reason that Rules
955 and 833 don't.

You missed my point.  Feel free to discuss the merits of the Proposal,
without regard to your votes.  I will probably repropose some version
of it at a later date.

The Plots proto has forced some thinking about how we do Currencies,
how we own things, transfer them, and so forth.  It's already been
noticed that Plots are poorly approximated by Currencies, and that
something else is required.  Other efforts in this direction have been
made (ref: Swann's recent Objects proposal), but none have approached
the topic in quite the right manner.

Property, generally, is the category of entities which can be owned.
Note that I exclude things like Kudos and Style Points from this
discussion because they do not behave like property.  Their "owner" is
not empowered to do the things that normally go with ownership.  While
it is possible to encompass such valuta under a generalized object
concept, they are not property because they have no or limited
ownership rights.  If we treat Kudos as property, their ownership
would have to be retained by the Bank in order for Kudos to retain
properties similar to what they have presently.

There are subcategories within this rather broad class.  Some
properties, like Currencies, have no location; others, like the
proposed Plots, do.  Call properties with location "tangible", and
those without, "intangible".  Tangible properties can be further
divided up into those whose location is mutable, and those for which
it is immutable.  Call the former "portable", and the latter "fixed".
This gives us a partition into three classes: intangible, (tangible)
fixed, and (tangible) portable.

Nearly orthogonal to this is fungibility: whether instances of a class
of entity are substantially (and, more importantly, legally)
distinguishable.  Fixed property, as a rule, is not fungible;
generally, different instances will have a different location, which
serves to distinguish each instance from the others.  Portable
property, however, may be either fungible or nonfungible.  An example
of a fungible portable property would be a "commodity".  An example of
an nonfungible portable property would probably be Mules, as proposed
in the Plots proto.

Similarly, intangible property may be either fungible or nonfungible.
Fungible intangibles include Currencies.  An example of a nonfungible
intangible would be the custom Mule designs I proposed in my recent
comments on the Plots proto, or the old Powers.

This did not change as a result of Steve's assertion in the PF. 

Why?  The relevant rule was infected.  For the same reason, I will not
be reporting a noisiness transition date for Kieron in my forthcoming
Registrar's Report.

Why didn't Agora vote?

Saperlipopette - I _meant_ to explain this in the report, but
forgot. Sorry. The truth is that I'm not really sure whether I voted
or not - I received very few votes (four overall) and was expecting
for some time that we might fail quorum in our referendum. I guess I
still did vote, but if I did, I didn't keep a copy of this message,
and Malenkai missed the vote because of eir mailing problems. I may
also have forgotten to vote in between of all the other RL and Agora
things that went on before Christmas - if I did, I'm sorry, and I'm
quite willing to accept responsibility for it.

I would like to comment on Steve's remarks that the abolition of the
FM and the virus were the result of successful PR by Michael and
Scott. 

While I admit that Scott's resignation helped to muster support for
these two proposals, I must say that I fully understood Scott's move,
and I supported them not because of the short term hubbub they created
but because they were a welcome deviation from what I consider a very
unsatisfying strategy in Agora gameplay: I'm not sure whether I'm
using this expression correctly, but I think we are too busy playing
with paper tigers instead of tackling the real issues.

What I mean is this: We create lots of "fun" structures like the FM
and the virus. These have two possible effects: 

1. They are harmless or nearly unnoticable. When they are, all they
create is extra paperwork (and, admittedly, some fun for the officers
involved and the players who are interested). Lots of activity of this
kind seem to be a very attractive thing for some players - fun to
watch, quite a bit of work to administrate, but really with no
significant effects. I personally consider this more of a waste of
time, especially as there are much more substantive things to do in
Agora, like trying to win, fixing the huge number of holes and
weaknesses in the rules (remember zeframs Huff?), IN participation,
scams etc pp.

2. Or they really do things - like the FM did when Oerjan started to
introduce all the mutations conderning voting, or the virus with the
recent infections of rules relevant for voting or TOs. But in this
case our instinctive reflex is to avoid such effects: by forcing the
Mad Scientist into a statement of policy that e will intentionally
limit the mutations to the harmless/useless category, by raising the
power of rules we don't want to see infected by the virus etc. So we
end up trying to get back to the first category again.

To me, this appears to be highly inconsistent: either we let the FM
roam free and wreak havoc - Oerjan really did a great job at
this. And, because we run out of troublesome ideas ourselves, we rely
on a random machine like the virus to push us into interesting
situations, point out or create loopholes that need fixing etc. But
then we should go for it and really enjoy it when these concepts work
and _do_ something.

Or we decide (and this is my viewpoint) that we can create enough
trouble to keep us busy and entertained ourselves. We are sliding from
one crisis into another anyway, some officers are very busy even when
things are running smoothly, so what do we need extra noise generators
for?

_This_ is why I was glad to see the abolition of the FM and the virus
proposed, and voted for them although I do understand that, for
example, Oerjan lost a toy he enjoyed playing with (and I must say
that he was a very efficient Mad Scientist, regarding both results and
(role)playing style). This, by the way, is also why I consider P-notes
superfluous at the moment - what do they really do? Create work for
the recordkeepor, cause PI penalties and nothing else. Big deal.

Well, enough ranting, off the soap box and back to work now.

I'd say that you may be trying to split hairs *too* finely. Rule 1729
("Insanity") says, in part, "...If no one votes FOR it, the Proposer shall
Win." Several other Rules, including Rule 955 ("Votes Required to Adopt a
Proposal") and Rule 833 ("Awards & Penalties for Proposals") define things
in terms of "Votes received" for a Proposal. I would say that the phrase in
Rule 1729 does not count cancelled votes FOR for the same reason that Rules
955 and 833 don't.

Not enough to pay people to vote for it. If it fails, Murphy will
just repropose it as part of the Plots proto. The only difference
will be that inflation will have gotten worse in the meantime.

I completely agree with you about P-Notes. The way they are presently
constituted, they are of no interest. There is the kernel of a good idea
in them, though. If P-Notes were really hard to come by, and if one had
to do interesting things to get them, then they might have a point.
Unfortunately, even this point that they might have is limited in its
scope - because it is a fact that not all Players make Proposals.
Nearly all Proposals are made by a small group of Players, and so
even if P-Notes were working properly, they would have interest
only for this small group of Players. Perhaps we should just get
rid of them entirely?

It doesn't seem to have mattered in this case, but Morendil and I were
both ineligible to Judge this CFJ, I as the Caller and Morendil because
I barred him.

Here's what it would take to excise P-Notes from the Ruleset:

####
Proto-Proposal
Repeal P-Notes

[Comment: even if Proposal Notes worked, only that small group of
Players who actually make Proposals with any regularity would care
about them. Better, I think, to give up on them altogether as an
interesting idea that didn't quite work.]

Be it hereby resolved that R1701 ('Proposal Notes') be repealed.

Be it further resolved that R1702 ("Petition Fee for Proposals') be
repealed.

Be it further resolved that R1727 ('Happy Birthday') be amended by
replacing the text "and shall pay out to each such Contest 5 VTs, and
to their Contestmasters 2 P-Notes each;" with the text "and shall pay
out to each such Contest 5 VTs;".

[Be it further resolved that R1451 ('Disowning Proposals') be repealed.]

Be it further resolved that R1760 ('Quorum Buyback') be amended by
replacing the text "one P-Note" with the text "three Voting Tokens".

Be it further resolved that R833 ('Awards & Penalties for Proposals')
be repealed.

Be it further resolved that R947 ('Bonus for Repeal') be amended by
replacing the text "3 P-Notes" with the text "one Indulgence".

Be it further resolved that R1047 ('Patent Title of Zeitgeist') be
amended by replacing the text "one P-Note" with the text "one Indulgence".

Be it further resolved that R1542 ('Style Points') be amended by
replacing every occurrence of the string "P-Note" with the string
"Indulgence".

Be it further resolved that R1748 ('Awards for Internomic Proposals')
be amended by replacing the text "In the case where the InterNomic
Proposal passes, the award shall be five Voting Tokens and two
Proposal Notes." with the text "In the case where the InterNomic
Proposal passes, the award shall be five Voting Tokens."

Tweak R1465 (Champion's Reward)

[Comment: R1465 was incompletely pragmatized by PC: strictly speaking,
it is impossible for the Registrar to pay out the VTs 'at the onset'
of the Champion's Reward.]

Be it hereby resolved that R1465 (Champion's Reward) be amended by
replacing the text

      At the onset of that Player's Champion's Reward, the Registrar
      shall pay out ten VTs to that Player.

with the text

      As soon as possible after the legal and correct announcement
      that a Player has won a Game, the Registrar shall pay out ten
      Voting Tokens to that Player.

An interesting and useful set of distinctions, Scott. The tangible/
intangible distinction, however, is not completely clear to me: what
sense of 'location' do you mean? Ie, in what sense do Plots have a
location while Currencies do not? Perhaps you're getting at something
like this: a tangible property is one which can be tracked (ie one
whose status can reported by the relevant recordkeepor) regardless of
who owns it. The only thing you need to know about a unit of Currency
is who owns it. Plots, however, can be distinguished from each other
in terms of their topological relationships to other Plots on the
grid, regardless of who owns them. It seems to me that it is this
definition of a topological relationship between Plots that secures
the tangible/intangible distinction. Have I understood you correctly?  

I think it's worth noting that there is no reason in principle why
Currencies could not be pushed over to other side of the tangible/
intangible divide. I can imagine that we may in the future introduce
new kinds of Structures which are not owned by any particular Player,
and which might produce units of Currency, also not owned by any
Player, but just sitting in a heap, as it were, on the Area where the
Structure is located. The Currency migbt go to the first Player to
move there and pick it up. ("You enter Area 25 from the south; there
are 5 Voting Tokens here.") In that case, we would have an example
of Currencies distinguishable in terms of their locations and not
in terms of who owned them.

OK. What we need, then, is a nice example we can thrash around.
Now, for reference, here's your Proposal again:

      No action by any Player may have, as a direct or indirect
      consequence, the effect of changing any part of the Game State
      prior to the moment at which that action occurred.  Any change
      which the Rules might seek to require to occur at a time prior
      to the time of the Player action of which it is a consequence
      takes place instead at the time of that action.

What if there were a Rule which retroactively tried to change the
text of another Rule? Imagine a Rule of the form:

      For the purposes of the Rules, Rule R shall be deemed to
      have had text T from time t (in the past) onwards.

Or, perhaps more straightforwardly:

      Rule R has had text T from time t (in the past) onwards.

Let's ignore whether this would get past R108 - that's a separate
question. Do you think such a Rule would be prevented from having
its intended effect by your Proposal? What do others think?
