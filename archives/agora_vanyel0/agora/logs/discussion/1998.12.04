This can be circumvented by reformulating the Rule into doing the
calculation the other way around, thus multiplying instead.

Not that I distrust you, Morendil, but yould you explain why you think
this ratification is important? I'm not sure I want to go through all
these reports for mistakes in detail (for example, I think the
Registrar's report had the wrong BOS listed). Therefore, I'm tempted
to object to all ratifications just to make sure I don't miss
something. But that wouldn't be fun, either.

If you have strong reasons for puuting all records in a clear state,
why not have one player check each report carefully before we ratify?

If we knew that the documents were 100% correct, there would be no point
in  ratifying them...
