My plan is to release the Accountor's report for the 9-the 13th later
today with revisions including the vacated orders.  I will then try to
prepare the report for the 14th through 20th for release very near the
beginning of the week, within hours i hope.

Given that the Rules make the time at which a TO is executed an
essential property of it, I would say that it's probably a mistake to
say that the TO "continues to exist" if it cannot be executed at the
appropriate time. The TO cannot float free, independently of the time of
its intended execution. If it continues to exist at all, it continues to
exist as a TO naming a transfer which was supposed to happen at a
particular time (or at least in a particular order relative to other
transfers), but which could not be executed at that time. There's no
reason to think such a TO should be executed at some later time, and in
fact the Rules say that it cannot be.

Can Speaker Murphy confirm that he has any intention of conducting the
Registrar Election, which is now two weeks overdue?

Curiously, I can find nothing in the Rules that places any time limit on
the Vote Collector to call for Nominations when an Election is required.
Am I missing something?
