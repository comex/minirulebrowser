I just did a 
  grep -i Chuck * 
in my directory of these old proposals, and the first you appear on is
#460.  You didn't vote on that one, but are mentioned in a list of
active players appended to the result.  Here it is:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
PROPOSAL 460 (Jim Shea) Tue, 7 Sep 93

Deregistration of Inactive Players
(Creates a New Rule)

A player not on hold who fails to post a message to the listserv, cast a
vote, or submit a proposal or CFJ for 14 consecutive calendar days is deemed
to have left the game and shall be removed from the list of players. If the
former player re-enters the same game, it shall be with the same score as
when e left and e shall not be considered a new player. Otherwise, e shall
enter on the same terms as a new player.

[ Motivation: There seem to be several players who have lost interest in the
game. This affects quorum, slows down the judicial process, and makes it
harder to implement rules which require participation of a majority of the
players. ]

Must be Voted on by: Tue, 14 Sep 93

[Speaker's commentary: I suppose that the implication is there that this is the
Speaker's responsibility. However, there is no way for me to check how long it
has been since a player has interacted.

I would be inclined to believe that the following players have left the game,
but cannot know for sure.

Sai <sai@comp.vuw.ac.nz>                             0
Joe Lindsay <lindsay@cs.wisc.edu>                    0
Kevin Watkins <watkins@sqba.bahs.twsu.edu>         -10
The Ed Blevins <thedward@wixer.bga.com>            -10

How about if we tentatively declare them to have left the game unless we hear a
protest from them. 

Clerk of Courts: Since Joe Lindsay was a judge for a CFJ, we need to get a new
judge for that CFJ.

You forget about Rule 1764:

      Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
      any votes, or the declaration of Presence, by Voting Entities
      on Proposals, Elections or Referenda, may only be achieved by
      sending a message to the Public Forum.

The first part "Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding..." IMO
says that this Rule takes precedence over all Rules that conflict with this
paragraph, so that includes 1715.

[Long list snipped]

Although it would double the Proposal length, I still think you should
include the original text of the Rules, as otherwise, especially with the
number and variation of Rules changed, there is a significant risk that
this would accidentally undo some other intermediate Amendment.

I was thinking about using the arguement that rule 1764 indirectly 
affects if a propoposal has met Quorum, by the virtue of allowing of 
disallowing private votes.  Thus the end of rule 1715 applies

R1715....

   This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which determine
   Quorum or whether a Proposal, Election or Referendum has met
   Quorum.

And so there is a contradiction over which rule takes precidence, and as 
1715 < 1764, then rule 1715 takes precidence, and my arguement stands.

Besides this, there is still the arguement that I managed to send a 
message to a public forum by sending it to every active player.  (I 
don't know if there is an active player not registered to the discussion 
forum but I doubt it.)

I don't think that this reading would be consistent with our game
custom of situational precedence; as I interpret the Rules, at least,
it is entirely possible for one Rule to take precedence over another
in one situation, and defer to it in another.  If we allowed your
reading of "indirect affect" then practically every Rule would have
some "indirect effect" on every other Rule, and precedence clauses
would be meaningless.

But your message lacked a clear indication that was intended to be a
Public Forum message.

I don't see as all precedence clauses would be meaningless.  As not all 
prededence clauses contain condtions about rules "affecting" various 
aspects of the game.  

Rule 1715 states that declarations of precence should be sent to the 
vote collector.  Rule 1764 states that it overrules other rules 
concerning if a vote (declaration of precence) is valid, for reasons 
only of where it has been posted.  Thus rule 1764 overrules rule 1715, 
and takes precidence over it.

Rule 1764 also disallows private votes, by changing the number of 
"allowed" votes rule 1764 determines whether or not a proposal has met 
Quorum.  Rule 1715 states that it takes precidense over rules which 
determine whether a proposal has met Quorum, and so rule 1715 takes 
precidence over rule 1764.  

Rule 1030

      If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

The Numerical method in this case favouring rule 1715.  So all of rule 
1715 takes presidence over all of rule 1764, and thus my declaration was 
valid.

>But your message lacked a clear indication that was intended to be a
>Public Forum message.

My message contained my declaration of precence.  If as you argue such 
declarations have to be sent to a public forum.  The fact that I sent 
such a message at all, would suggest that it was intened for a public 
forum.  (In this case it was, I did not mean to post it to the 
disscussion forum).  

I think this does make sense (hopefully)

By that reasoning, though, practically every other Rule also

Is that a "clear indication"?  At best it's an inference.

I would agree that there are elements of the games state that are not
legally protected from being changed and that changes do occur
outside the "authority" of the Rules.  However, I'm not sure what you
mean by "not subject to being changed under the authority of the Rules".
If you mean the Rules don't have authority over entities which are subject
to change from "outside" influences, then I would still disagree.  The Rules
can attempt to make themselves have authority over anything, but there are
certain kinds of *changes* over which the Rules can exercise no control, even
if they attempt to, i.e. changes which occur as a result of "natrual law".

>I'm not sure that there is a meaningful distinction between "game
>state" as you have defined it, and "everything".

Of course there is.  And it should be easy to see.  "Everything to which the
Rules refer or to which they have ever referred" (i.e. everything pertaining to Agora),
is clearly not identical to just plain "everything".  Although, as we have seen with
your proposed changes to the Proposal definition, it could encompass a large
number of essentially extraneous and "unkowable" entities.

If you are trying to eliminate having to make a distinction between those
properties that entities have intrinsically and those properties which they have
solely as a result of the Rules, I don't think you will be successful.   Changes to
the latter can always be protected from change via legislation.  Certain kinds of
changes to the former could not be so protected.

I do understand the reasoning.  But most other rules which affect Quorum 
in that manner do not contradict rule 1715.

Hmmm fair enough, I could try to fight on.... But I think that all this 
over a miss posted message is a bit much though.  It has been in insight 
into the rules though.... Thanx...

Indeed.  I'm not saying you're wrong; you might actually be right.
You could try calling a CFJ on the question.  In fact, I encourage you 
to do so.

Don't give up so easily.  One of the things Agora is known for is
niggling over little tidbits of language.

Perhaps we should legislate that the Registrar can designate certain 
forums to be explicitly NOT the PF, not matter how the message is marked.
I certainly do not want to ever have to accept votes sent to agora-
discussion.
