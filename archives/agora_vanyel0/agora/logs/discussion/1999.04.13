Ah, I missed that one.  However, it's still too early for PI isn't it?
 
According to R1713, this PO became overdue seven days after it was
issued, i.e., on 13 April 1999 (today).  The beginning of the week was
the 12th (yesterday), so it's only just become overdue, and I won't be
due for a PI penalty until the beginning of next week.

No?

Michael.

published my Appellate Orders so we can complete this?  It seems this
is long overdue.
