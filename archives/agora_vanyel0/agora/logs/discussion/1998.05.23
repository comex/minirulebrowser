I believe the question is whether the act of amending a single order
can "bifurcate" that order into two orders.  That's the situation
which exists here.  If we take your interpretation (which seems
logical), then the actual effect of Swann's amending order was to (a)
amend one order and (b) execute a new order.  Unless I've missed
something, (b) was prohibited.  It becomes an exercise in sophistry to
decide which of the two resulting orders is the improperly executed
one, however.

It should be noted that I made no Orders; I made several motions
requesting Orders.  Not quite the same thing. :)

Oh, right. I hadn't seen it that way - guess I'll have to go and read
all those silly messages once more to get the fine points straight. 

I would certainly, however, agree that it's not possible to amend one
Order into more than one. Generally, in fact, I think we'll need to
give 'amend' a commonsensical interpretation; amending an Order
means altering some particulars of it, e.g. changing the amount,
the Currency or the payee in a Transfer Order; but I'm not certain
it should even be possible to amend an existing Order to apply to
a different Player than it applied to originally, and it is certainly
no more admissible to amend one Order to make it effectively two
than it is admissible to amend a Rule into two Rules.

Hmm. I take that back. If we interpret Orders as being non-Rule
bodies of text with coercive power granted by Rules 1810 and 1811,
as it still seems logical to me to do, then amending such bodies of
text in the same manner that we amend Rules makes sense.

The problematic notion here is that of 'one' Order. The problem is
that there is no clear 'granularity', so to speak, which could let
us count Orders. Suppose I posted a message saying "Swann is
hereby commanded to give 1 VT to an English-speaking Player,
and to give 1 VT to a Player living in the US", how many Orders
should we count ? Two, because there are two sets identified,
or only one, because Swann could comply with this Order by
carrying out only one action (giving a VT to an English-speaking
Player living in the US) ?

Thus, what Swann did was more akin to amending one Rule to
contain two clauses when it originally contained one. So I would
probably rule that Macross' objection doesn't apply.

Wait a moment.  He still may not, then, Amend an Order to increase the
number of provisions, since that amounts to creating new Orders.

I'm not arguing that the Order was invalid.  I'm arguing that, since e
made the order conditional-- e said "I make the following order only if
it is legal for me to do so..."-- and the Orders I made were
presumtively valid, e never made the Order because the precondition was
never valid.  Since it wasn't legal to issue the Order, e never issued
it.  Now, I agree, if e had issued the order, legal or not, it would be
binding and we'd be in a pickle right now.  But since e didn't the
problem, fortuntly, never arose.

The good General made a similar remark a while ago. I initially
agreed, but that interpretation clashes with my notion that Orders
are no more nor less than bodies of text with coercive power (i.e.
the equivalent of Subordinate Legal Codes). Under that interpretation,
there's no problem with multiplying "Orders" by amendment - youre'
only adding more clauses to a text which previously covered fewer
cases.

I'm still not sure whether that is a fatal flaw with the "Orders as
SLCs" principle or an indication of its usefulness. ;) But as I've 
remarked, an argument based on the principle that Orders can
be somehow counted might get dangerously close to angels-on-
a-pinhead issues.

However, I hold that it doesn't apply in this case.  In your example
you create two separate orders.  In this case Swann is amending a
single order, which after amendment would not split into two separate
orders but rather remain a single order.  This amended Order is by
definition not an Order at all, or, if it is an Order by virtue of
it's having been one in a previous form, it is at least invalid.  I admit
that in the latter case I may be afoul of the presumption of validity
clause.

I don't believe that I have issued any illegal orders, since the only
Order I've issued since Swann amended his Orders to include me was
proceeded by a clause that it was only issued if it was legal to do
so.  The questions now are was it legal and can we find that out before
I might fall afoul of Swann's requirement for me to vacate the Orders
I issued.

This is why I have refrained and will continue to refrain from making
any further Orders.  Also, you will note that my last Order enjoining
Swann was specifically designed to prevent em from making any further
Orders which would only convolute the situation.  I, for one, don't 
want to bog the game down anymore than necessary to resolve this.

On a related issue, I intend to make myself ineligble to judge any
CFJ's that relate to this matter.

"
      An Order is a command, executed by a Player and directed to some
      entity requiring that entity to perform exactly one action, or
      to refrain from performing one or more actions.
"

If it commands someone to both perform and not to perform actions, or to
perform more than one action, it is not an Order.

However, the above does, of course, allow an order to forbid more than one
action.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

I see a number of possible interpretations in decreasing order of
probability;
(Invalidity here refers to an Order that would be properly adjudicated
invalid eventually)

1) The amendment caused a split of One Order into two, and both orders
were valid because the amendment creating the second Order was
permissible.

2) The amendment caused a split of one Order into two, and the latter
Order, the appended text that was amended, is invalid because the
amended was a de-facto issuing of a new arbitrary Order, which was
forbidden.

3) The amendment didn't cause a split, but created a new, improperly
formed Order which would be adjudicated invalid.

4) The amendment didn't cause a split, and the Order is still valid
because 1783 explicitly grants power for 1800 to allow amendments, and
the amended Order, to be effective even when the amendment contradicts
the provisions of 1793.

5) The amendment made the Order into something that isn't an Order.

5.1) The above, and the amendment itself was invalid because of that
fact.

6) The amendment itself wasn't properly formed, and therefore wasn't an
Order, and never changed anything.

The first three I find the most likely interpretations, the latter four
I find to be somewhat unlikely or "weird" but possible alternate
interpretations.

The issue is not that he added clauses but that he amended the Order
such that it now contains clauses that by definition cannot be
contained in the same order.  An order may not, by definition, contain
requirements for both action and inaction.

In this case I think the Order ceases to be an Order.  Consider a CJF
that said "An Order requiring action and inaction is invalid.".  Bearing
in mind that such a beast is by definition not an Order, how would you
handle the CFJ?

Rule 1800/0 reads in part:

"
Amendment of Orders

      The effect of amending an Order is to cause it to be effective
      in its amended form.  The prior form of the Order ceases to have
      effect upon the amendment, and the new form has effect as if it
      had been originally executed in that form at the moment the
      amendment becomes effective.
"

This is the only place in the Rules that I can find mention of
the effects of amending an Order and I don't think this would
allow amended Orders to bifurcate.  I am of course open to argument
to the contrary.

I think that's also wrong ! If you want to get *that* subtle, you 
will have to pinpoint exactly what shade of meaning of the word
"legal" Macross was using in that conditional. Myself, I'm of the
opinion that "legal" in that context could very well be equated with
"permitted, on a prima facie basis, by the Rules" -- which means
the above objection falls afoul of the 'presumed validity' issue once
again. You would *still* have to CFJ on Macross's Order to prove
that it was not legal for em to issue it, which means that until such
a CFJ is called and judged we have to assume that it was legal.

Then, by definition, something that contains both is actually two
Orders.

That can be ruled out, at least - an Order to Amend cannot have the 
effect the creation, de novo, of a new Order. But then again my own
feeling is that it's a moot point because counting Orders is as 
useful as counting dancing angels on the head of a pin.

 Confusion of levels here. In the same *sentence* (or for that matter
in the same phrase) you might very well find more than one 'command'
(in the standard english meaning of the term, synonymous to
injunction, entreaty, etc.). But the Rules don't require that an
Order be a full sentence (and no more). Examples : "Oerjan, shut up
and stop contradicting me" is a sentence with two commands; "Swann,
please vacate one of the Orders you've issued. I'm referring
specifically to the last Order in your message 'Here we go'" is one
single command in two sentences.

 Short of a logical contradiction, therefore (e.g. "Morendil, will 
you please make yourself clear by not writing anything more on
the subject") you will have a very hard time finding a single Order 
that both requires an action and prohibits an action.

 The Rule fragment you quote above is confusing because of the 
tension between "exactly one" and "one or more" - suggesting that 
Orders are something you can count with precision - but in my
opinion that's simply not the case.

 We do on the other hand have some game custom to the effect that if
one writes "I hereby issue _one_ Order requiring Player X to do Y",
then that should count as one Order. (I'm reasoning by analogy to the
occasion when I was brought to court for issuing, as Judge, illegal 
Injunctions and it was ruled that a Player stating "I hereby issue 
many Injunctions" was presumed to have issued more than one. The 
situation here is not quite analogous, but somewhat similar.) But as
far as I can see Swann was not using this kind of phrasing; merely 
stating "I hereby Order X to doY, Z, and W".

Not good. A Court of Appeals needs to be able to reverse a Judge's 
incorrectly issued Order to Stay or Vacate another Order.

I'd replace v) by something much stronger, such as "v) it seeks to 
deprive a Player of a right granted em by the Rules, in the absence 
of explicit provisions in the Rules for an Order with such effects".

This will both preserve the Rules' ultimate power, as well as let us
rewrite something like Orders to suspend Voting privileges more
naturally : "The Assessor may deprive a Player of eir Voting
privilege by issuing an Order to refrain from Voting on Proposals
for a period not exceeding X weeks".

On the other hand, I'd be even more in favor of making the notion
of "Orders as non-Rule entities with coercive power" explicit, which
would make a lot of the foregoing unnecessary, as well as some
of what follows.

> Let the following Rule be created with a Power=2;
> (Title: Precedence of Orders)

This could be tied in with 'Orders as NREs' simply by having one
Rule for each class, explicitly stating that "Orders of class X have
coercive power over Players; this Rule takes precedence over any
Rule granting coercive power to Orders of class Y but defers to any
Rule granting coercive power to Orders of class Z and W".

>      An Order can only affect the operation of another Order when the 
>      Order so affected does not take precedence over it.  An Order that

This (plus an implied 'unless the Rules specify otherwise') would 
directly follow from "Orders as NREs".

>       All Administrative, Judicial, and Appellate Orders executed in the

Let's drop this "type" language altogether. Let all such orders be
presumed valid.

>        i) Private Orders shall not be for a proper purpose unless they

That's good... Perhaps i) needs some fine-tuning; something along
the lines of "are directly relevant to an agreement entered into by
the Player issuing the Order and the Player or Players to whom the
Order is directed", which would form a good basis for adjudicting
contract disputes.

I don't think this is appropriate either, for a variety of reasons.
I'd prefer a "In order to be proven valid, a Private Order must ..."
and define alternative conditions on what we want to consider valid
Private Orders.  The main value of Private Orders is pursuant to an
agreement between Players; I think such orders should be presumptively
valid, but your "fix" makes them presumptively invalid.  Orders which
are not pursuant to an agreement between Players should be
presumptively invalid, except for Transfer Orders, which are special.
I have not yet come up with a good way to deal with this distinction.

"Orders which are not pursuant to an agreement between Players, or

maybe ?

On consideration, I think it would be better to simply make it
improper to issue a Private Order except when permitted by the Rules
or by an agreement between Players (and restrict the latter case to
allowing such Orders to be directly only to Players who are party to
the agreement).  Such orders will be probatively invalid.  Their
presumptive validity is not important because if you try to take such
an order to "court" (CFJ alleging contempt) the invalid order defense
can be raised.

The presumtive validity, IMHO, doesn't apply to the conditional--
either e made the Order or e didn't.  And you're implying retroactive
effects here. . . The Order can only be adjudicated invalid if it
exists in the first place!

I don't think "cannot" [sic, as I know from bad experience :-)] belongs

However, "cannot" (and "can not") are frequently used to denote
impermissibility, the strict incorrectness of such usage
notwithstanding.
