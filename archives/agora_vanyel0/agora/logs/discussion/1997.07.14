How can a body of text which derives it authority from the Rules, as this
Constitution clearly does, since it it parasitical upon the notion of
Power defined in the Rules, be considered to be separate from them?

To put it another way, what reason have I to obey this Constitution
*apart* from the fact that it adopted according to the Rules and is
granted authority by them?

All players agreed to abide by the Ruleset at the time at which
they joined, and implicitly (just as the initial agreement is
implicit) at any time after that in which they were players.

None, if all players decided to do so.  It's when the agreement
is not unanimous that there are problems.

Agreement to accept the Initial Ruleset (again, implicit) was unanimous
among all players who joined before the first proposal was adopted.
Unanimous agreement seems to me to be a "stronger" form of agreement
than non-unanimous agreement.

Then I would have no problem with the actions of the players,
although I would call it an extra-game decision to also grant
authority to the Constitution.

For the instant it's in effect.

Because it's only through the Power=4 Rule that the new body has
"authority" over Rules.

Hm, I just noticed that I have no record of a Herald's Report from
Crito either. My first thought was that we are having a regrettable
epidemic of failures to Report. Then I remembered that I had some
mail trouble last week, and might have missed some Reports. So, 
before I go ahead and report Crito, I thought I'd wait a bit and
see if either Harlequin or General Chaos (or both), can produce evidence
that my reports above are mistaken.

In fact, it might be a good idea if all the Officers who have to
produce weekly Reports - ie Ambassador, Assessor, Cartographor,
Herald, Mad Scientist, Notary, Registrar, Rulekeepor and Wizard -
could confirm with me whether they produced Official Reports for
the week ending Jul 13.

Well, I know I produced a Registrar's Report and Chuck published a Ruleset.
For the others, I have no records.

The relevance of the Nomic Potato precedent should not be taken
for granted, but needs to be carefully investigated. Rule 1011 has
been amended 3 times since then. The two cases are at least
superficially similar, however.

My take on this: bodies of text, qua bodies of text, are not Nomic
Entities, since they exist regardless of the Rules. However, the
property of being a Rule, being a Proposal, being an Application,
being an SLC and so on are all Nomic Properties in the sense defined
by Rule 1011. Likewise, I would regard being a Transfer Order or
being a Payment Order as a Nomic Property that a body of text can have.

Hence I interpret the 'destruction of an Application' to mean the
removal of the property of being an Application from a body of
text. It cannot mean the destruction of the text itself, since
clearly the text continues to exist, it's just that it no longer
has the legal force of an Application after it has been 'destroyed'.
In this light, the choice of that word is perhaps seen to be unfortunate.

Much the same has been said of the adoption of the Constitution of the
United States, in contravention to the then-prevailing (but
inadequate) Articles of Confederation.

If a Proposal was adopted that stated "The Rules shall be amended in
full, so as to read.... <text of Constitution>", that would establish
a Constitution, assuming the Proposal met with the relevant criteria
for such a sweeping amendment.  In general, a subsequent body of
supreme law cannot hope to establish itself (without a revolution)
unless it does so in accordance with the procedures for doing so
stated in the prior body of supreme law.  If no procedures exist, then
it cannot be established as a new supreme law without first
establishing the necessary procedures in the old supreme law.

I agree with Chuck, a class of entities defined by the Rules is also a Nomic 
Entity.  So the point being no two nomic entities may have the same name.

      A "Nomic Entity" is any entity which has no discernible
      existence without the Rules, only existing by virtue of the
      Rules defining it to exist.  No two Nomic Entities (including
      Players) shall have the same name or nickname.

However, currencies minted by groups in this way do not exist *only* by virtue 
of the Rules.  They also exist by virtue of the Player with proper authority 
creating them.  IMO, Misanthropists Orders, Payment Orders, and Transfer 
Orders are not Nomic Entities by this definition.

I was about to reply that as Promotor you are not required to
make a weekly Report - but then I remembered that you have to
publish a P-Note Report. Which you have.

There seem to be two possibilities here: either the Misanthropist-minted
Transfer Orders are completely distinct from the bodies of text which
the new PC Rules will designate as having the property of being
Transfer Orders, merely happening to share a name (we had no problem
distinguishing between the Power Cards and the Power of Rules, or between
the Nomic Potato Contest and the Nomic Potato), or we could adopt
your suggestion that each Misanthropist-minted Transfer Order has
associated with it a body of text, wiuth consequences that are unclear.

But does the latter possibility really make conceptual sense? I have often
found it useful when thinking about such issues to imagine that we are
actually playing face to face, using physical tokens. Imagine that we
are using round red poker chips to represent Voting Tokens. We have these
Rules about Mint Authority, and in anticipation of these Rules being used,
we've acquired a large number of poker chips of different colours so
that each newly minted Currency can be assigned a differently coloured
chip to represent it. Your announcement concerning the Minting of
'Payment Orders' , 'Transfer Orders', etc, bsically amounts to saying
"I'm creating a new Currency, with such-and-such a name, and I'll be
using round blue chips to represent them."

Now come the new Pragmatic Currency Rules. According to these Rules,
a Payment Order is an obligation imposed upon you to transfer poker
chips to the Bank. The conditions under which such obligations are
created and satisfied are of a completely different nature to the
conditions under which your blue poker chips are used. There's no
particular reason to represent the existence of such obligations using
poker chips, although of course we could choose to do so, perhaps using
square chips to represent the fact these are not to be confused
with Currencies, which are all represented using round chips of
different colours. But even if we did choose to represent the
existence of obligations with chips, I cannot see that anyone would be
remotely tempted to argue that we must use your round blue chips
to represent them, or that these round blue chips would then have
both their old properties as Currencies, and their new properties as
obligations, merely because they happen to have the same name.

In other words, I think that ultimately, this attempt of yours, 
interesting as it is, should probably share the fate of the Nomic
Potato Contest. We should regard your newly minted Currencies as
distinct entities which happen to share a name with some other,
different entities. Where the new PC Rules refer to Transfer Orders,
Payment Orders, etc, we should have no trouble disambiguating from
context which of the two kinds of entities is being referred to.

Uh ? According to which of these Rules ? The ones I have read state that a PO
"is an order" - which can be read as "is a pale blue chip", or as "is a
requirement stated by a person", since as you know the pale blue chips that I
minted are also called "Orders".

Actually, the introduced Rules describe no such conditions; as pointed out
already, they don't even attempt to regulate how Orders, little say POs and
TOs, are created.

Unfortunately, you would have to show proof of that, for each individual Rule
involved mentioning Transfer Orders. I think that the above reasoning places
simply far too much credit witth the _intent_ of the Rules created by P/C,
rather than with their letter; again, the PO Rule for instance states that a PO
is "an order" - that _could_ be the same as "an Order", depending on how you
interpret the Rule. It doesn't say, let there be a class of Entities known as
Orders - I admit the situation would have been different then.

I find this helpful for many questions - so many things are much
easier to understand in the context of a face to face gaming group.

Steve:

I would love to be able to follow your application of the face to face
picture with respect to Agora currencies, too. (Nomic) life would be
so easy if using currencies would simply be the equivalent of pushing
around poker chips.

But I am afraid this doesn't quite work. Most of the hassle that the
rules (both before and after PC) impose on making, owning and
transferring currencies appears to me to be necessary only because we
are _not_ playing face to face, so we can _not_ use physical tokens
for currencies. If we could, a huge amount of recordkeeping,
ordering/asking for/inititating, detecting and reporting currency
transfers would be superfluous, wouldn't it? Written payment or
transfer orders - just imagine how silly they would be in a face to
face game of Monopoly.

And as far as currencies are concerned, the "game state" could be very
simply defined by the physical contents of every player's (physical)
treasury. Just like cash in real life - if you loose some, tough
luck. You might want rules against (physical) theft and the like, of
course, but in many board games such rules are simply part of the meta
rule set ("fair play").

But playing in the virtual world we need means to avoid
counterfeiting, stealing and other unwanted things - they could not
only occur bacause of intentional cheating, but also "by accident" as
communications are lost, inconsistently tracked etc. And that is more
complicated because virtual currency is so much easier to create or
manipulate in ways not provided for by the rules than a one inch
plastic token.

I think much of the problem raised by Morendil hinges on our
representation of things that have no physical existence whatsoever
outside of the game (Nomic Entities) in a "physical" way. "Physical"
in quotes, because email-messages still have something distinctly
virtual about them, they are easy to fake/manipulate/destroy etc. (Did
you notice how terms like "a slip of paper", "the text of a xyz" and
the like appear in a rather unsystematic way in our arguments around
Morendils Mint Manipulation (MMM)?)

So we'll have to sort that out more clearly: the relation between
completely virtual entities and actions that exist only within the
game, the half virtual and half physical means to report, record
etc. these things in out email communications and the all physical
means we _could_ use playing ftf, but don't because we are not sitting
in the same room. I for one feel rather confused about these things,
but then I am a newbie with a lot to learn (do I hear the shadows in
Plato's cave shouting "yes, go for it"? ;)

Agreed. We had a huge debate about this issue once before, when *I* was
still "the new guy." I think we likened our own system to being closer to
having a bank account you could transfer money to and from; the issue
revolved around whether, if the bank misrepresented your balance, you
actually lost/gained money until it was fixed, or merely had the same
balance with an incorrect bank slip. I argued the former...

I produced a Cartographor's Report on 7 June (incl. below.) I did not
produce a Mad Scientist's Report because Ex-Mad Scientist Morendil had
already produced a Report for the week of 7 July (also incl. below),
which should absolve me of any need to do so.

I produced a Cartographor's Report at the following date:

I did not produce a Mad Scientist's Report because Ex-Mad Scientist
Morendil had already produced a Report for the week of 7 July, which (I
believe) should absolve me of any need to do so.

Murhpy, thank you much.  I just got a new 200mghz Pentium computer for
my workstation  last week.  Unfortunately I forgot about my mail archives
at the time, so they were lost when I switched from the old one.  Boy,
how's that for timing.  8)

I think one of the central points of the Judgement is still
relevant, though: (to paraphrase) whether something is "named"
should be interpreted narrowly.  The Rules which would be
enacted by PC would create Transfer Orders and Payment Orders,
but nowhere does it say those classes of entities are *named*
Payment Orders and Transfer Orders.

I would argue that two entities (or classes thereof) which
coincidentally have the same common appelation are identical with the
other if and only there is a sufficiently compelling reason for
adjudging them identical.  The only reason I can see for holding the
Misanthropist-minted currencies identical with the entities that would
be established by Proposal 3533 appelated with the same names is that
it would be vaguely amusing for some people; I do not hold this to be
sufficiently compelling.  I also draw the attention of the Electorate
(as potential Judges in this matter) to Rule 217, which requires
that the Judge of any CFJ consider both commonsense and the best
interests of the game.  Is it in the best interest of the game to hold
the game's economy hostage to Morendil's whim?
