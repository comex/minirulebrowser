I am willing to put a lot of time into making interesting stuff in
AgoraMOO.   I might even know some people who might want to play there.
So what if it takes five years to build it up?  It is a DIVERSION.  I,
for one, would ten times rather build my own world than walk about in
someone else's mature world.    We might develop something to be proud
of, like Agora itself.  

I think we have a chance to make something different.  How about a home
for several Nomics? Or just another environment, less of a physical RPG
than SW, more than a talker.  We have a chance to make it whatever we
want, to build constructs to embody some of our theoretical concepts.
In the past we have had a virus in the rules, we still have the R-O-M,
what might we invent in a MOO? We might stumble onto something new and
fill a void. If it fails, and doesn't takeoff, SW will still be there.

Not really. I think attaching Agora to something 'concrete' is 
probably the wrong direction - it would be better to start with 
something concrete and add a Nomic. Besides, I suspect that many 
players of Agora *like* it not being attached to anything concrete.

Okay. What are people's opinions on these questions:

Should Agora have a MUD, of any sort?

Should it be simple or complex?

What should the style be...
Hack & Slash? [ala Dungeons and Dragons]
Economic? [trade, etc.]
Combinations, other?

Who should determine the physics? How can it be changed?

What elements of Agora should be influenced by the MUD...
Kudos?
Points?
Wins?
Currencies?
Proposals?
Voting?

Who should have to play in the MUD...
Only those who want to?
Officers and those who want to?
Everybody?

Should the MUD attract non-Agorans? If so, how?

What other concerns are there? Suggestions? Comments?

This seems like a good time to introduce another of my ideas for 
dealing with VT scarcity: a Proposal that merely launches several 
Referenda on whether or not to change the rules. Perfectly legal 
(although somewhat complex), probably honorable, and mabie stylish.

A CFJ alleging that one cannot request to be disqualified for "all
future CFJs" was ruled TRUE.  Thus, your attempt to disqualify
yourself was ineffective.

Initially simple, tending to complex very fast as we use it.

RPG-oriented, without imposing an RPG style of play on people who 
don't want that. This means combat and money and everything, but
you don't have to know about them if you don't want to.

The programmers of the system.

None.

Y. One idea is to invite other Nomics in.

The fewer the better.  It might be interesting to allow a means of

Hmm - actually with a little effort it would be easy to link
boards/mailing-lists directly into gecko's web site. Shattered
currently has direct access into the mud's web page and we can
modify the web site from within the mud. I could also 
create an account on gecko which would be subscribed to the 
Agoran mailing lists and could mailout and/or receive mail and
put it into the mud environment (and web environment).

I think there needs to be a clear recognition that the rules set
is above and beyond any particular medium. By being in the email
environment for so long Agora has developed a number of rules
specifically for that environment making it hard to separate the
environment from the rules. I think by changing the 
tools/environment you use to interact and develop the rules set
it would certainly shake it up and give a totally different perspective
to it. It also puts the rules set in a position to slide around
into different environments in the future.

In earlier posts I was advocating a stronger embedding, but I've been
convinced that this is not politically saleable. Therefore I'll add my
voice to Scott's remarks above.

Here's my suggestion for starting up. It's also an example how new
legislation might work. I think we should propose that, at least
initially, all businesses run in the Land of Agora are community owned,
with profits going back to the community. I'm not sure if a community
can literally own a business in SW, but if not we can simply give
ownership to one of the Officers (or create a new office for the
purpose), and instruct the Officer to collect all revenues on Agora's
behalf. We'll need money if we're to survive as a community. (Cf Blob's
post on bounties.)

The first problem new players in SW face is: what to eat? In Sanom City
players kill creatures (eg rats) and sell the corpses to player-owned
butchers who make food out of them which the butchers sell to
player-owned restaurants, who sell the food to hungry players. All
prices are set by players, so there's genuine economy happening there.
Geoff has indicated that he'll create a butchers shop and a restaurant
in Merenth so that Agorans won't starve.

Here's my first business idea: delgath owns the butcher shop in Sanom,
and he's currently running the business at a loss as a kindness to new
players with little money. He doesn't need the money, since he's one of
the richest players in SW. He's also sympathetic to our cause. I think
we should ask him to raise his prices. We'd only be asking to stop
making a loss. We could then advertise cheap food to the other citizens
of SW. This would bring us money, and bring players exploring in our
domain, so giving us a chance to interact with them where our laws are
in effect.

On the other hand, that Judgement has been Appealed, so its status is

Proto-Proposal
A Duty to Vote

[Comment: effectively, compulsory voting for those can afford it - a real
'use it or lose it' scheme. This ought to increase the size of the
economy, and enable the BOS to be lifted, which I think we'd all like to
see, if it were consistent with maintaining balance. Perhaps this proto
will be controversial; I hope it will be supported. I would be prepared
to add a sunset clause to make this a trial, if enough people thought
that was a good idea.]

[v1.1: added an activity test, and changed the On Hold Rule to prevent
Players from being On Hold for less than week. This change is long
overdue, in my opinion, and should help to eliminate all sorts of
opportunities for abuse of the On Hold system that are springing up
between the cracks of the order system.]

[v2: having considered the difficulties in capturing in a definition
of 'net assets' the intuitive idea of effective control of assets, I've
taken a new tack in this version of the proto: the Assessor decides
what assets e thinks a Player has effective control over and acts
accordingly. Eir decisions can be challenged in the Courts if
necessary.]

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "A Duty to Vote", be enacted
with the following text:

      An Active Player with effective control of more than three Voting
      Tokens at the time a batch of Proposals is distributed, who is not
      denied Voting Privileges at that time, who is Active at the end of
      the Voting Period of the Proposal in the batch whose Voting Period
      finishes latest, and who fails to cast a vote on any Proposal in
      the batch, commits the Infraction of Failing to Vote, to be
      detected and reported by the Assessor. The penalty for commission
      of this Infraction is 1 Blot and 1 VT.

      Effective control of an asset (eg. a unit of Currency) is the
      ability to dispose of that asset as one wishes. The Assessor is
      empowered to make determinations as to whether a Player has
      effective control over a particular asset at a particular time.
      Such determinations are defeasible and may be overturned by the
      Courts.

      Three months after this Rule is created, this Rule shall repeal
      itself.

Be it further resolved that Rule 1016 (Putting Oneself on Hold) be
amended by replacing in it the text which currently reads:

      E may not do so until at least 96 hours after e last went On Hold.

with text which reads:

      E may not do so until at least a week after e last went On Hold.

Er, when did we start talking about taxation?

Hm. I wasn't quite thinking straight there. Delgath is, of course, in
the business of buying corpses, not selling them, so what we'd have to
do is ask him to is to *lower* his prices so that we could offer better
ones. But there's a hitch: we'd need capital to start a butchers shop in
Merenth. Still, we should be able to raise capital from somewhere.
Perhaps what we really ought to be looking at is the restaurant end of
the food chain, not the butcher shop end, But I don't know who has the
food selling concessions in Sanom City. Delgath? Are you listening?
