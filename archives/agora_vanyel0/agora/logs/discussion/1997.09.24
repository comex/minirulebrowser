I am very much in agreement with this position.  While interesting
arguments exist for both positions, I have not seen a compelling
reason why nonsimultaneity is mandated, and I think that there is an
intuitive appeal to simultaneity.  Has anyone any arguments they wish
to make?  My Judgement is due in about six days. :)

Hmm.  Since that is not a rule change, I would think it is *not* prohibited by
R108.  It would constitute another example of "legal deeming".

Your elaboration here is precisely what I had in mind and why I worded the CFJ
the way I did, i.e. those 10 days take on the designation of Voting Period *at
the time of disinfection*, not before.  Note that this interpretation still
allows voting in the portion of the 10 days that extend beyond the time of
disinfection.  Votes cast *before* the time of disinfection within those 10
days may or may not be valid, depending on how you define "during the Voting
Period", but that would be another CFJ.  8)

IMO the first claim of Sole Purpose is effective, and the other two are
TIA violations (but only if the scammer didn't expect to get away with it).

Actually, I like simultaneous implementation better as a default,
perhaps also allowing the proposal to specify an order instead.

A determination can be made: Whatever the judge determines it is, it 
is. It's not uniquely determinable as either true or false, but 
there's valid evidence (the statement combined with the judge's 
determination) for either way.

Clause iii) is, of course, the most applicable. If all of these 
are dismissed, I have an idea for some clearly relevant CFJs... :-)

Do you mean the distinction between, say,
A) the Herald incorrectly believes that you have no Persistent Debt, and
B) the Herald incorrectly believes that the Rule defining the Persistent
   Debt Infraction is broken and ineffective?

Opposed.  I don't like infinitesimal increments of time much to begin
with, and think we should be trying to get rid of them, not trying to
introduce more of them.

Perhaps the Rules could be amended so that, for the time it takes a Proposal
to take effect, the game state is frozen such that only the state changes
listed in the Proposal can occur.  Any intermediate state the game enters
while the Proposal is in the prosses of taking effect has no effect on the
frozen game state.  Only the final state has any impact at all and then only
in the next instant of time when the game state is unfrozen.  Essentially,
the idea is to create a situation where the proposal takes effect between
two instances of time.  Other than the changes listed in the proposal it's
as if that instant never happened.  If something like this were in place, a
proposal that destroyed a currency's Mintor and then made a new Mintor would
not destroy the currency because the lack of a Mintor can have no impact on
the frozen game state.  When the game state is again unfrozen, the currency
has a Mintor so it is not destroyed.

FWIW  I agree with you, but I would expect someone to scam this the instant
that the TIA rule is infected.

I also believe that the second and third claims would be TIA violations on
their face, whether or not the scammer expected to get away with it.  E
can't claim three distinct purposes are each the "sole" purpose.

Actually, my most fun as a Judge has always come when I do _not_ do this.
Keeping an open mind as far as possible into the process has led me to some
surprising and delightful discoveries.

I'm wondering more and more about this.  For example, an earlier Judgement
(CFJ 914) addressed this very issue (with respect to the order of
payments). Judge Chuck made some telling comments:

>There is nothing in the Rules which suggests that if a Rule requires

I would go further.  In implementing a Proposal, while the natural and
commonsense way might be to start at the beginning and work our way down,
this is no longer mandated by the Rules, and any Game Custom along those
lines would have to yield to Rule 594's instruction to implement the
provisions to the maximal extent permitted.

If some different ordering (or unordered simultaneous implementation)
yields a fuller implementation of the Proposal, we must abandon the
top-down method.

Further, I'm not sure that Game Custom is clear in requiring the top-down
order. In the last year we've passed close to 70 multi-part Proposals.  In
all but six of these the ordering was irrelevant  (E.g., P.3500 amended
"Mutability Index" to "Power" in Rule 1681, then in 1439.)  Any ordering
(or unordered simultaneous implementation) would have the same effect.

In the others (P-notes, Agoraverse, Indulgences, Ambassador, Office of
Wizard, End of Marks) the ordering was important, but the top-down order
followed was one in which the Proposal could be maximally implemented (not
an accident; it's natural for Proposal authors to write that way).

I'd say if the ordering makes no difference with respect to Rule 594's
requirements, we are entitled to assume the provisions are implemented
simultaneously.

In order to make the judicial process somewhat more responsive to the
views of the masses, I make the following proto-Proposal, and invite
comments upon it.  

Unless there are serious and/or numerous objections I will propose it
quite soon.

The original version of this idea is due to Jim Shea who had it
adopted in the Tabula game.  (His version of the rule is available at
 http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/mn200/games/nomic/reed/387.html)

(Promotor: the following is not a Proposal)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend 951/9 so that the first paragraph reads:

      Whenever there is a Call for Judgement which is neither Judged
      nor dismissed, and to which no Player who is eligible to Judge
      that CFJ is assigned to Judge that CFJ, the Clerk of the Courts
      shall select a Judge to be assigned to Judge that CFJ.  This
      selection shall be done as soon as possible after this condition
      becomes known to the Clerk of the Courts, and shall be done in
      accordance with those rules that specify the eligibility of
      Players and the method of random selection to be used.

Create a new rule called "Acuity recorded" with the following text:

      Every Player shall have associated with them a rating known as
      their Acuity.  Acuities are natural numbers (including zero).
      New Players shall join the game with Acuities of 10, unless they
      have been a Player within the last three months, in which case
      they shall rejoin the game with whatever Acuity they had when
      they left.

      A Player's Acuity may only change in ways specified by the
      rules.  Generally, if a change to Acuity would see it fall below
      zero, the change is altered so that the Acuity becomes zero.

      The Clerk of the Courts shall maintain an Official Document,
      known as the Acuity Ratings, that records the Acuities of
      present Players and those ex-Players who have left the game
      within the last three months.  The Acuity Ratings must also
      include the mean Acuity of all current Players. The Acuity
      Ratings must be published as an official report at the beginning
      of every week.

Be it hereby resolved upon the adoption of this proposal that the
Acuities of all Players be 10, with the exception of the Justiciar,
Speaker and Clerk of the Courts, all of whom shall have Acuities of
12.

Create a new rule called "Acuity guides judge selection" with the
following text:

      The Clerk of the Courts selects a Judge from those Players
      eligible to Judge by randomly choosing from all those eligible
      subject to the provision that a Player's chance of selection is
      directly proportional to their Acuity.

      The selection method must thereby satisfy the following
      criteria:
       *  Players with Acuities of zero will have no chance of
          selection;
       *  Players of equal Acuities shall be equally likely to be
          chosen; and
       *  If Player A has twice the Acuity of Player B, then Player A
          shall be twice as likely to be selected as Player B.

Create a new rule called "Acuity changes in response to Player
opinion" with the following text:

       In the week following the publication of a CFJ's outcome
       (whether it be dismissed or decided), all Players are eligible
       to vote in an Acuity Referendum with respect to the Judge who
       decided that CFJ.  Similarly, in the week following the
       publication of an Appelate decision, all Players are eligible
       to vote in an Acuity Referendum with respect to the each of the
       Justices who decided that Appeal.  (Hereafter, where this rule
       refers to a Judge, it is mean to refer equally to an Appeal's
       Justice.  Note that an Appeal's decision will thus be followed
       by three distinct Acuity Referenda.)

       Default rules for Referenda apply except that
       * The Vote Collector for an Acuity Referendum is the CotC.
       * Vote values are SOUND or UNSOUND.
       * Voting begins upon the publication of the CFJ's outcome.
       * Acuity Referenda do not have Adoption Ratios, Quora, or the
         notion of failure.

       When an Acuity Referendum has finished, the CotC is both
       authorised and obliged to alter the Judge's Acuity in the
       following manner:
          * if the number of SOUND votes exceeds the number of UNSOUND
            votes, the Judge's Acuity is increased by the number of
            excess SOUND votes;
          * if the number of UNSOUND votes exceeds the number of SOUND
            votes, the Judge's Acuity is decreased by the number of
            excess UNSOUND votes.

Create a new rule called "Acuity changes in response to Judges'
performance" with the following text:

        If a Judge commits the Infraction of Failing to Judge, the
        Clerk of the Courts is authorised and obliged to decrease that
        Judge's Acuity by one.

        If a Justice commits the Infraction of Failing to Judge an
        Appeal, the Clerk of the Courts is authorised and obliged to
        decrease that Justice's Acuity by two.

        If any aspect of a Judge's decision is appealed, and the
        Appeal Court overturns the Judge's decision, then the Clerk of
        the Courts is authorised and obliged to decrease that Judge's
        Acuity by one.

        On the other hand, if an Appeal Court sustains a Judge's
        decision, then the Clerk of the Courts is authorised and
        obliged to increase that Judge's Acuity by one.

Create a new rule called "Speaker may re-introduce failed Judges" with
the following text:

        The Speaker is permitted to ask the Clerk of the Courts to
        increase by one the Acuity of any Player with zero Acuity.
        The Clerk of the Courts is thereby authorised to do so, but
        need not unless the Justiciar also makes the same request with
        one week.

Create a new rule called "Usual Justices must maintain a high Acuity"
with the following text:

        If the Justiciar's Acuity is below the mean Acuity of all
        Players, and this fact is pointed out in the Public Forum,
        then the Justiciar is removed from office.

        If the Speaker or Clerk of the Courts have an Acuity below the
        mean Acuity of all Players, they shall not serve as a Justice
        but when selected to serve as a Justice must, if possible,
        delegate their duty.  If possible, the delegation must be to a
        Player who does have an Acuity higher than the mean.

And lots of PI POs to write, as will other recordkeepors. We may even
see some deregistrations due to lawlessness. And I don't see how the
exact wording of 1733 could give us a way to describe such POs as
disputed: there were several CFJs connected to their effectiveness,
but none doubting their legality.

My suggestion would be to try and get a few VTs in circulation soon
and then adopt a kind of RGBIII - an amnesty cancelling all these PI
blots, and redistributing a small initial supply of VTs to everyone.

Of course all this is only necessary if the judgement of CFJ933 is
sustained.

Hmmm... Don't know how it got there. It was originally assigned to Vlad,
now to Steve. Maybe I made some mistake when adding Vir to the Eligible

Would it be illegal, given a few VTs in

VTs , Indulgences, and P-Notes and go on from
there?  Or would that violate the spirit of Agora

I like this except for the fact that it is extremely fragile in the face of
errors.  For example, if somebody notices that their Acuity was wrongly
reported 5 months earlier, the CotC would be obliged to re-assign all CFJs
called during that period.

I'm actually tired of the amount of "re-rolling" we have to do _now_ when
there's a mistake in the eligibility list.  Couldn't we have this depend on
the *reported* acuity and registration? (with sufficient safeguards to
prevent scams by the CotC).

Also:  the provisions for removing the Justiciar, Speaker, and/or CotC from
the Board of Appeal are begging for trouble, as soon as the first Appeal
CFJ of the form "The Justiciar's acuity holdings are actually NN."  It also
isn't necessary; if someone's decisions are that unpopular, or if they
default too many times, they can be impeached.

Other than this, I think it's worth a try.

How about something like: "Reliance by the CotC on the most recently
published report of Acuity Ratings is deemed sufficient to satisfy this
Rule, unless that report is subject to a COE or CFJ."

This might have the effect of booting the Justiciar out of office, only to
discover much later that there was some error in the calculations and e
actually hadn't left Office after all.

This might mean that a CFJ about Acuity holdings would have an
indeterminate Board of Appeals.  I don't like this.

I usually start with a provisional position, and then change my mind

Frank writes that the seeking of justification is distinct from the
seeking of a decision.  One seeks a decision based on hunches and
intuition, and then, after having found the decision, seeks its
justification in law.

Although there are a number of interesting ideas contained in this
Proposal, I think on the whole I will oppose it, mainly for two
reasons: firstly, Judge selection ain't broke - so why why fix it?
It's not as if we've been suffering from a spate of ridiculously
inept Judgements from inexperienced or ill-informed Players. On the
contrary, I think the standard of Judgements lately has been pretty
high. The system we're using now is well understood, stable and seems
to be working, so unless you're arguing for change for change's sake
(and why not? The same justification has been offered for PC), I don't
see a compelling need for this. Secondly, I'm afraid don't like the
fact that the idea is borrowed from Tabula.  I'd rather see Nomics
differentiate than homogenize.

Notwithstanding my general opposition, I'd still like to offer
a suggestion regarding the proto: I'd completely exempt Boards of
Appeal from selection by Acuity. One of the most desirable features
of the current system is that more or less the same Players hear all
the Appeals arising from various CFJs which different issues and
crises tend to provoke. I'd be vehemently opposed to altering this
feature of the Judicial system. Likewise, I'd scrap the provisions
which would see the Justiciar dumped from Office, and the other
regular Justices made ineligible to Judge, more or less for making
one bad or merely unpopular decision. The proto as it stands is
almost an invitation to mob rule. The Justiciar, Speaker and CotC
deserve more slack than that.

Interesting remarks. So: imagine we had adopted a Proposal containing
the following amendments:

(1) Amend Rule 7777 by replacing all occurrences of the word "Points"
    with the word "Marks".
(2) Amend Rule 7777 by replacing the text "New Players shall receive
    5 Points." with the text "New Players shall receive 10 points."

Is it your contention, then, that Rule Change (2) must be held to
take effect before Rule Change (1) in order to satisfy R594's
requirement that the provisions be implemented to the maximum
extent possible? (On the plausible assumption that the null amendment
resulting from (2) if (1) is carried out first is not the fullest
possible implementation of the provisions in the Proposal.) It's not
that I can see anything wrong with this conclusion. It's just that I
had never before considered that R594 might have this kind of effect.

I am more sympathetic to your conclusion than to the argument you
give for it here, which seems to me a desperate stratagem. If the
falsity of CFJ 933 really rested on this interpretation of R1586,
then your argument would be in a poor state indeed, for that
interpretation is insupportable. If a single Rule defines a Nomic
Entity and that one Rule is repealed or amended such that it no
longer defines that Entity, then it is equally true to say that the
Rules defining that Entity have been repealed or amended so that they
no longer define the Entity. Your conclusion that R1586 applies only
to the effects of whole Proposals and not to the effects of
individual Rule Changes is completely unwarranted.

I think you're much better off with the argument gestured at in
your first remark, that there was no constructible moment in time
at which VTs did not have a Mintor. While I have been arguing, and
am on the whole still of the opinion, that there was such a moment,
I can see merit in both sides of that argument.

Not illegal, but also Not Done. I believe the custom has been
to VOC/ratify only proactively, not reactively. Of course, while
it's a custom I approve of, nevertheless it remains only a custom.

Not illegal, but also Not Done. I believe the custom has been
to VOC/ratify only proactively, not reactively. Of course, while
it's a custom I approve of, nevertheless it remains only a custom.

Change for change's sake is basically the argument.  The judicial
system is all of the things you describe, so why not try and do
something new with it?  Also, I envisage that it might give people
another metric by which they could measure their impact on the game.
People who care about their judicial reputations can have these
quantified a little.

Tabula is dead, and has been that way for at least a couple of years.
I don't see that we're in any danger of homogeneity.  Lifting ideas
from other nomics might be dodgy if those others were still around,
but this is completely unclaimed judicial property.  Jim Shea was also
a player at Agora, if that helps at all.

The proto as written does not alter the selection of Board of Appeals.
All the rules relating to Appeals would be left unchanged.  The aspect
you identify as favourable in the current system would not change at
all, unless (and this is the second issue you raise) the incumbents
were forced to delegate their authority because they had insufficient
Acuity.

"Mob rule" is a bit emotive in my opinion.  Let's face it, the
proposal mechanism is such that the mob _does_ rule in Agora;
proposals can bring about any change, and the judicial triumvirate
can't do anything about this. 

Low Acuity scores don't forbid the Speaker and Clerk from Judging,
only from serving as Justices.  

In any case, I'd be happy to make the provisions with respect to the
Usual Justices more liberal; making the cut-off point two thirds of
the mean, say.  If the usual Justices have already been elected by a
majority of the voters, then it doesn't seem that likely that they
will be subject to too much unwarranted criticism in the form of
UNSOUND votes.

Michael.

Yes, I had meant to address this more fully, but see that things are
still too "Platonic".   I will address this in my next version
(forthcoming).

I believe that making it clear that Acuity values are to be taken from
the last published report will finesse this problem.

If the Players' opinions are such that an impeachment would be
supported then I think UNSOUND votes and the mechanism I outline would
do the trick.  Conversely, I think that the "automatic impeachment" of
the Justiciar (perhaps with more generous limits, as mentioned in my
reply to Steve's comments), is unlikely to fire without an impeachment
also being likely. 

The CotC and Speaker cases are less interesting, because they aren't
impeached, only stopped from performing as Justices.  Perhaps doing
the same for the Justiciar would be better. 

Michael.

Am I correct in assuming that we don't have to do anything in particular about this - that the new selections simply render our previous decisions irrelevant and that all that remains is for Blob and Elde to submit their decisions?

I am unswayed by elJefe's argument, because I hold eir particular 
measure of the 'fulles possible implementation' to be highly
subjective, and suspect that it would lead to purely ad hoc decisions.
Not, mind you, subjective in the sense that it would be idiosyncratic
to elJefe and em alone; only in the sense that it would depend on the
Judgement of some Player or Players and that different Players might
hold different opinions as to what constitutes that 'fullest possible
implementation'.

For instance, consider a highly hypothetical Proposal stating :

* If at least one Puffle exists, then one Piffle shall be created.
* If less than one Piffle exists, then one Puffle shall be created.
* If one Piffle and one Puffle exist, both will be destroyed.

Implementing this in order creates one Puffle; in reverse order, it
creates one Piffle and one Puffle; and there is one ordering that
creates one Piffle, then one Puffle, then destroys both. The results
of a simultaneous implementation are *much* harder to define, too.

How would one measure the 'fullest possible implementation' for the
above ? Would we have to look to other Rules to determine if it would
be more desirable to have a Piffle than a Puffle, and if so why not
consider that the fullest implementation of the Proposal would be to
create the least desirable situation ? After all, the aim of the
Proposal might be to punish, rather than to reward. Do we have to
take the Proposer's intent into account, something we usually want
to avoid when interpreting Rules ?

The only objective measure that I can think of is counting the actual
*number* of 'separable provisions' taking effect as a result of applying
all provisions in a Proposal in each possible order, which may vary
because some orderings may result in earlier provisions will place
the Ruleset in such a state that later provisions would be ineffective.

Then again, that would screw up the following Proposal :

* Amend Rule 1579 by appending, "This Rule has no legal effect".
* Repeal Rule 3000 ("The Mintor of VTs is the Bank")
* Repeal Rule 4000 ("The Mintor of P-Notes is the Bank")
* Repeal Rule 5000 ("The Mintor of Indulgences is the Bank")
* Enact a Rule : "The Mintor of all Currencies is the Speaker"
* Remove the last sentence of Rule 1579

Such a Proposal would only make sense if implemented in order; but,
setting that aside, I for one certainly wouldn't be able to determine
if some other ordering yields a 'fuller implementation' than any other
ordering (except maybe for the 6 trivial permutations of the three
Repeals, which I guess would leave the Proposal's 594-value invariant).

I suppose that the strongest possible argument in favor of the notion
that ordering of Rule Changes is called for by the current Ruleset as
augmented by Game Custom is that all of us would expect a Proposal such
as the above to work as designed. Which I suppose is a variant on what
Steve has been saying.

Don't you see a contradiction between that statement and your previous 
comments about the order of application of judicial standards? The 
'implied order' you were advising seems even more subjective to me than 
the definition of 'fullest possible implementation.'

I (obviously) do not agree.  The problem is that Rule 1586 is
essentially referring to "before" and "after".  I find that when I
seek to determine whether Rule 1586 has application to the VT Mintor
problem, I see that VTs had a Mintor both before and after the Rule
Changes in question (albeit a different Mintor before than after), and
Rule 1586 imposes a continuity through this change.  The fact that
multiple Rule Changes took place effectively simultaneously does not
alter the requirement for continuity required by Rule 1586.

Rule 1586 clearly speaks to temporality, and I think when multiple
Rule Changes take place at the same time, Rule 1586 speaks to them as
a whole, rather than to each Rule Change individually.

I am now reasonably convinced that there is no compelling reason to
believe that the application of the multiple parts of a Proposal are
separated by infinitesimal moments, nor do I believe that any existing
Game Custom is strong enough to overwhelm Rule 594's "maximum extent"
requirement.  I admit that the simultaneity thesis does lead to
complexity when a Proposal contains two or more Rule Changes which
stand in conflict with one another.  I consider the resolution of such
matters to properly be the domain of the Courts.  Morendil, I believe,
complained that such an evaluation is subjective.  This may be; it
does not deprive the law of its meaning, any more than a Rule which
stated "Only those Rule Changes which Michael approves of shall be
implemented" would be deprived of meaning because of its reliance on
Michael's subjective evaluation.  I have no problem at all with
leaving the determination of the "maximal extent" of a Proposal in
"difficult" cases to the (possibly subjective) evaluation of a Judge.
This is, after all, why we have Judges.

In closing, I should note that I despise the "infinitesimal moment"
concept and wish to see it abolished.  If I am given the opportunity
to write case law which will lead in that direction, I will do so.

I also challenge that subjective standards of adjudication are somehow
barred.  I cannot, for the life of me, see how "the best interests of
the Game" can be evaluated in an objective fashion.  I would expect
that Morendil and myself are often at complete odds as to what this
legislative judicial factor entails in specific cases.

Why, and with what would you replace it?  It seems to be a very well
understood concept, that simplifies a lot of otherwise complex events.

Unfortunately, this proposal was before my stint as Promotor and I have no

Sorry,

I have admitted as much, haven't I ? Don't rub my nose in it. ;)

"Sole purpose" is really too strong, when you think about it.  If I
Transfer an Indulgence in order to satisfy a Blot, it should be obvious
that I am not doing it for the sole purpose of removing that Blot.  I am
also doing for the purposes of avoiding PI, and to reduce my risks of
becoming Lawless. For other types of actions there might be even more
purposes, some of which might not be direct effects of the main one.
Determining the full set of purposes of an action is probably impossible,
even for the performer. 

So I might suggest something like "sole declared purpose", which might
however be too vague (declared where? by whom?).

The best would probably be to make "sole purpose" a Rule-defined term like
ASAP, Random and the like.

Greetings,
rjan.

I have occasionally been thinking that it would make sense to allow any
Game State Change whatsoever to be declared Without Objection. Possibly
but not necessarily excluding Rule Changes.

However, I would then want some extra safeguards in place so that such WO
Declarations cannot be buried in other reports. It would be far too easy
for Chuck to hide something in the Ruleset, for example.

Maybe a requirement that any Without Objection declaration must be within
the first 20 lines of the body of the message containing it.

Hmm.  I'm not so sure that infinitesimals is very well understood, based on
recent posts.  Looks to me like Players aren't sure exactly what is the
definition of infinitesimal that we are using.  I haven't made up my mind
whether the concept is helping or hurting at this point.

The best would be to drop the idea of "sole purpose", and just state that

That only plugged the loophole that gave Crito an enormous number of wins. 
It did nothing to prevent one such Win by proposing an enormous number of
Proposals.

That is only prevented (by strong discouragement) by the Rule whose repeal
has just recently been Proposed.

I would leave out this last paragraph. Also, you have to have some fall-back
mechanism if all players have zero Acuity. Furthermore, you have not
specified when a Player loses Acuity in an amount that would make it
negative.

What if they are selected as Justice, and it is impossible for them to
delegate their duty? For example because noone is willing to take it over?
If you do not want a certain Player to fulfill Justice duty, e should not
be selected to serve a Justice. Furthermore, if we disallow the Speaker and
the CotC to serve as Justice with less than average Acuity, why not the
same for other Players?

My understanding was that while this argument could very well resurrect
the Currencies, it would do nothing about the destroyed Currency units.

Hard cases make bad law. Try something like this (not yet a Proposal, Crito):

============================
Steve is installed in the Office of Dogcatchor, created as a result (direct
   or indirect) of this Proposal.

Create a Rule:
      Let there exist the Office of the Dogcatchor, with the duty to
      search through the Ruleset for outdated or inapplicable Rules.

      The Dogcatchor does not receive a fixed weekly salary.
============================

Strict adherance to order would say that the Office is created, but Steve
is not installed in the Office because the first clause was invoked before
the Office existed.  Wouldn't such a reading violate Rule 594?

The discussion about this makes me think it would be much simpler and clearer
to just specify that a TO can only satisfy one PO, as in the original proto. 
It might be less elegant than the above, but it is certainly less open to
interpretation.

Why should we want to make a concept the explicit default in a rule
that has caused so much trouble? I'd rather go the opposite way, as
Chuck suggested.

I think it is rather unelegant to deliberately keep such concepts
alive - just look at the weird extra regulations Morendil had to use
to give an example of a working variant of the PC reform:

>>
* Amend Rule 1579 by appending, "This Rule has no legal effect".
* Repeal Rule 3000 ("The Mintor of VTs is the Bank")
* Repeal Rule 4000 ("The Mintor of P-Notes is the Bank")
* Repeal Rule 5000 ("The Mintor of Indulgences is the Bank")
* Enact a Rule : "The Mintor of all Currencies is the Speaker"
* Remove the last sentence of Rule 1579
<<

I think it is silly that provisions like the first and last step in
this example should be necessary to make such proposals work. 

I must admit that zeframs remark,

>>
It seems to be a very well
understood concept, that simplifies a lot of otherwise complex events.
<<

left me quite puzzled. I wouldn't really call our recent discussions
of infinitesimals an indication that the concept is well understood,
and I wouldn't call the possible unwanted destruction of all
currencies in the PC reform a simplification of otherwise complex
events, but the complification of otherwise simple ones - even if at
the end of the day they did survive, the hassle with CFJs and all that
may have been fun, but it sure wasn't a simplification of things.

Obviously some of the reasons that led you to introduce this ordering
with infinitesimal time steps are not clear to newbies like me - and
in a game with some fluctuation of players, like Agora, I think that
is a bad sign for a concept. Do new players really have to learn lots
of esoteric tricks and convoluted extra clauses to be able to make
proposals work? I think rule mechanisms that avoid this would be much
preferable.

Kolja A. (still hoping someone will give a short historical lecture on
why this ordering-with-infinitesimals business was ever considered
preferable to simple simultaneity)

I can imagine that this would be fun. Having elections, referenda and
things, some reputation involved like in the Kudo system, also a
punishment for failing to judge that slowly reduces the chance that
absent or negligent players delay important decisions...

One detail I don't like: A single referendum vote can (and often will)
change a player's acuity much, much more than all the one-acuity-point
penalties. I think that failing to judge should, if anything, have a
more negative effect on a player's acuity than making one unpopular or
even sloppy judgement. So I'd suggest either doubling the penalties
for failing to judge, or limiting the changes in the acuity after a
single referendum to, well, maybe two points or so.

As I read this, it is basically equivalent to inserting "Officer Reports"
into the list of Rule 217.

I don't see a need for that exception. I think I like the below suggestion
better.

For the last part, simply define the Crime of Deliberately Hiding an
Infraction, with heavy penalties and specifically excepted from the
statute.

Hm. While I am divided between making provisions take effect
simultaneously (thereby avoiding entities being destroyed by other Rules
in the middle of the process) or in order (thereby avoiding questions
about the effect of several amendments to the same text), I pretty much
think we should get rid of the word "infinitesimal".

a) It's not well understood, as is evidenced by recent discussion;

An excellent point.  It seems that it is erroneous to challenge case
law, as opposed to statutory law, with exceedingly contorted--not to
mention unlikely--situations.

Agreement there, my point was that if Players cooperate, they can avoid
reporting the Infractions until the Crisis can be properly settled.

That's the result of a mistake.  If Scott had borne the infinitesemals
issue in mind, e could have avoided this.  What I was referring to was the
interpretation of otherwise ambiguous events -- simultenaity introduces
much complexity, as the discussions of "maximal extent" indicate.

It seems to have been Game Custom before it was legislated.  It's fairly
intuitive to apply the parts of a message/Proposal/whatever in the order
they are stated.

I don't agree that the first claim is effective, given that it is also a

It's not just that the RK can refuse to record them, e can refuse to honor
them, solely on account of their being delayed.

If things happen at the same time, then they happen at the same time,
and can't be ordered.  The closest one can get is an infinitesemal gap.

Yes, that's true. To my defence: No, I wasn't thingking of R1663 when
making this proposal. My intention was to use it to start something like
a chromatic repeal (although with a twist - making a proposal to repeal
each and every Game Entity instead of each and every Rule). Well, some
other time I guess...

Discussion has assumed that "implement to the maximal extent possible"
is, at least in some cases, in contradiction with applying provisions in
strict sequence, infinitesemally separated.  But I believe that sequential
ordering is not a matter of the *application* of a Proposal; rather, it
is a matter of *interpretation*.  Game Custom is clearly that Proposals
should be interpreted such that their provisions take effect in the
order they are specified; "implementing to the maximal extent possible"
is entirely subordinate to this, as it says nothing about changing the
meaning of Proposals.

CFJs 750-880 can be found at http://www.imsa.edu/~dwarf/agora/cfj/. (Vanyel)
CFJs 871-938 at http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/mn200/games/nomic/yoyo/cfjs/
 (Michael)

If I find the time for it I will put down CFJs 930 onwards, I suppose.
I don't think I'll find that time anytime soon, though.

I fail to see any force in this objection.  Subjective or not, "Implemented
to the maximal extent permitted" is the language of the Rule.  It's not
being offered as some nice metagame principle for us to try; we are obliged
to follow it.

When I first studied this, I noticed two things:

(1.)  Rule 594 does not say that we implement the Proposal.  It says we
implement the _provisions_ contained in the text of the Proposals.  It does
not say anything about an order for doing so.

[[ There could be disagreement about exactly how a given Proposal is
divided into "provisions", but that is not an issue with 3533.]]


(2.)  Rule 594 explicitly recognizes the "provisions" as separate entities
when it states that the provisions of a Proposal are separable. That is, if
one is found invalid the others are implemented regardless.  This looks a
lot like "changing the meaning" of the Proposal.


Given these, I have no trouble saying that 594 may force us to implement
the provisions in a particular order.  How would you rule on the Dogcatchor
proposal?

Game Custom is subordinate to the Rules?

No, it's not.  Rule 217 does not assert that any of the things it
lists are true, or are to be accepted as true.  

In fact, Rule 217 is completely the wrong place to put this; or, at
least, the issue that Rule 217 is orthogonal to what I am speaking of.
Rule 217 defines what is considered the _law_ of Agora Nomic, and
speaks to resolving questions of law.  I am seeking to establish rules
of evidence, which speak to resolving questions of fact.  The two are
almost orthogonal to each other.

I disagree, and I see no reason to accept your assertion as true
without justification.

Keep very much in mind that we are speaking of a construct of law.  It
is entirely reasonable, to me at least, that two things might occur at
the same time, but one before the other, if a law requires that we
consider them to have occured in that order.  You are assuming that
order of action must be precisely temporal; I am permitting the
existence of a "tiebreaker" for events with the same temporal index.

I have occasionally been thinking that it would make sense to allow any

<<

My problem with such changes without objection is this: Objections are
meant to be a safeguard against unintentional mistakes and intentional
scams. But: how often did we figure out that some change had a
completely unwanted side effect, or introduced a nice big loophole,
only weeks after that change took effect? In such cases, the
possibility to object is long gone when the problem is identified.

So we'll either have to run the risk of getting lots of unwanted or
scammed changes (or annotations to the rules, in Steve's more specific
project), or, in trying to avoid this, get paranoid and object
anything that isn't obviously and explicitly foolproof, thus stifling
all the wanted changes.

Doesn't anyone run diff on a published ruleset and the previous
version to make sure I haven't changed anything I shouldn't have?
You really should, you know.

I did between the last two FLRs, just for the principle of it, and I
intend to continue doing this.

However, for the WO case the diff would have to be done each time the
Ruleset is published. 

Moreover, diff doesn't make much sense for those documents that change
most of their content between postings.

Greetings,

It means that actually, they take place at the same time, but for purposes
of anything that cares about order, such as resolution, they take place
sequentially.

You're going to have to work a little harder to convince me that two 
things can happen at the same time, but one before the other. It's not as 
though "before" is a term defined in the Rules.

I find that kind of stupid; if it's for the purposes of "anything that 
cares about order,"
then why not just define them sequentially but separated by *zero* time? 
That makes much more sense to me than things happening at the same time 
but at different times, which is what this boils down to.

That's exactly what it is... they happen at exactly the same time (i.e. they
are seperated by *zero* time), but they happen sequentially.  Exactly what
you just said.

That's what the "infintesimally(sp)" part means.

The Necker cube strikes again. Both, it seems to me, are ways to 
state the exact same thing. So Players of Agora have traditionally 
been of a slightly mathematical bent, and we end up with the ugly 
term 'infinitesimal', big deal. If that's all that's bugging Scott, 
by all means let's rewrite 1527, I don't think it makes an iota of 
difference which way you state the principle.

That is, IMHO, just bull. Scott raised the issue that the Rules in
some places explicitly require subjective interpretation of matters
of law or of fact, as in "the best interests of the Game". However,
while it is entirely reasonable to require a Judge to render a
decision based on wholly subjective grounds, which can after all be
corrected by a Courts of Appeal, and keeping in mind that Rule 217
requires that a Judgement must first be consistent with the Rules,
it is something else entirely to require the Rulekeepor to make
judgement calls as to which of the huge number of permutations in a
complex Proposal produces the 'fullest possible implementation' of
the provisions therein.

IMHO that would be simply unfeasible, and I challenge you to come up
with a reasonable measure for determining which ordering of the
provisions in an arbitrary Proposal produces this fullest
implementation.

No - but then I would argue that the Proposal was effective, because
it implicitly delays the time when its first provision takes effect
until the Office is created. IOW, it has more provisions than you 
think.

Now consider the following :

============================
Create a Rule:
      Let there exist the Office of the Dogcatchor, with the duty to
      search through the Ruleset for outdated or inapplicable Rules.

elJefe is installed in the Office of Dogcatchor, created as a result
(direct or indirect) of this Proposal.

Steve is installed in the Office of Dogcatchor, created as a result
(direct or indirect) of this Proposal.
============================

Who is Dogcatchor ? Why ?

Well - if you want, I could give you an example of a Proposal where
simultaneity is going to require its author to resort to contorsions
just as 'silly'. But we've been doing quite well with the 'ordered'
assumption up to now, and I think one exception only proves the rule. 
In any case, you should be the one providing support for your 
position instead of deriding a hypothetical Proposal that I offered 
as an example of something else altogether anyway, and I'm not going 
to do your work for you. So there. ;)

On the other hand, we 'old hands' have been around long enough to 
know what works - where do you newbies get off telling us how we 
should go at this stuff, uh ? ;)

My opinion is that one would be as bad as the other, and it's a case 
of better the devil you know.

And it actually seems to me - sorry folks, but I need to be frank - 
as if Scott and elJefe are resorting to desperate measures to save a 
patient who's already dead. However 933 is Judged, I'm sure no one is 
going to think that 3533 wasn't severely flawed - not that anyone 
should be blamed for flawed Proposals, but there's such a thing as 
caring too much.

Actually, I believe the point is that we write messages to the PF as
well as Proposals as if they were recipes, sets of instructions : do
this, then do that, and so on. I suppose that if we had a Rule
stating that all provisions in a Proposal are implemented
simultaneously, Proposal authors would feel compelled, for
moderately complex Proposals, to write stuff like -

A) The Mintor of VTs shall be the Bank
B) After provision A) taking effect, Rule X shall be Repealed

Yes, there are "silly" examples given either interpretation.
Which is why I believe that any new legislation along these
lines should have whatever paradigm we choose as a default
only, and allow individual proposals to override the default.

I would think that a Player's State of Mind is inseprable from the Player
as far as the Rules go (at least in this instance) The Game State Change
that is most proximate to the effect being prevented is the change which
put the obstinate player in office.

We habe a causal chai like so:

a) Player becomes Chancellor, b) Player becomes Obstinate, c) Proposals are
impossible.

Obviously c) is the result of a in combination with b (neither alone could
result in c) and since b is not a Game State Change, what we have left is a,
a change in the game state that resulted in c.

They can already do that - 594 provides for it. If in a Proposal some 
provision requires some earlier, or later, provision to have been 
implemented before it takes effect itself, then 594 guarantees that 
this will be honored, doesn't it ? (But that's a far cry from claiming 
that it rearranges provisions 'all by itself', which is actually what 
I think upsets me the most in elJefe's theory.)

Yes, it would.  If they occured at the same time, then the entire CFJ
933 issue would be moot: there would, without any doubt, be no
constructible moment of time at which the VTs had no Mintor.

I take the above as a repudiation of your prior claim that there was a
constructible moment of time at which the VTs had no Mintor, by the
way, as that prior claim lies in contradiction with the above claim.

Do try not to be more royalist than the king, and not split hairs
into any finer pieces than I do. You admit the notion that these
events might have occurred in order; if they did, provisions in
other Rules which were relevant to these respective events were 
applied in the same order.

I concede that 'infinitesimal increments of time' is a confusing
concept - but we must either accept that the provisions in 3533 took
effect in order - in which case the Mintor of VTs 'ceased to exist'
before the provision instating a new Mintor came into play, and VTs
were destroyed before getting a Mintor back - or that they took
effect in no particular order, a hypothesis of which I can't yet
fathom the full implications, precisely because the notion of events
occurring in order is much ingrained in the game's traditions.

IOW, the phrase 'constructible moment of time' is no more nor less
meaningful than 'infinitesimal increments of time'. It all boils down
to whether you want to string game events like beads on a thread, or
you'd rather have bunches of them in small packages that happen to be
messages or Proposals or whatever.

Just read the rule :)

Rule 1527/2 (Power=1)
Timing of Multiple Events in One Message

      Whenever a message contains more than one notification, report,
      or other communication in which the Rules place some legal
      significance, the communications in that message shall be taken
      to have been sent sequentially, separated by infinitesimal
      increments of time, in the order which they appear in the
      message.

Note what this says...

Whenever a message contains more than one ... communication in which the
Rules place some legal significance.

This is why I asked to see the "e-mail" that was sent (which I didn't receive,
but I did receive the proposal).  The mintor of VTs rule being repealed and
the Bank becoming the mintor rule all took place in the same *proposal*.

Rule 1527 says *nothing* about timing of multiple rule changes in one
proposal.  It would, however, affect the timing of multiple proposals in one
rule.

I think the applications of Rules 1527 and 376 are well understood in
their respective domains. Most of the confusion has arisen from the
attempts to apply these Rules beyond the scope which they set for
themselves.

In the case of R376, the ordering requirement makes sense and has
served us well (as can be seen from the fact that it has not been
amended for 30 months) in handling the case where different Players
submit different Proposals to amend the same Rule independently of
each other, and these Proposals get distributed together, and are
adopted together. In order to figure out in a sensible way what the
combined effect of the two Proposals is, it is necessary that the
Rule Changes they contain be held to take effect in some order or
other. The ordering imposed by R376 is simple, sensible, easy to
understand and quite intuitive, although it certainly not the only
possible ordering that could have been chosen. It's greatest
advantage is that everyone can tell when they cast their vote what
order the Proposals will take effect in, and hence what the outcome
will be if both Proposals are adopted. I am quite frankly mystified
by Scott's suggestion that we repeal R376 and lob such cases to the
Courts to be decided on a case-by-case basis, since this very
important feature of the current system will then be lost.

I take (c) to be equivalent to the reintroduction of infinitesimals.
If we had a Rule which said: rule changes in a single Proposal take
effect at the same time, in the order they appear in the Proposal
(which in fact is what I argue is the case at present), then Morendil
would be making exactly the same arguments about CFJ 933. Ie, that
since VTs lost their Mintor before getting a new one, R1579 must
have been triggered.

By all means, get rid of the word 'infinitesimal' if you like. But it
won't help.  All the puzzles about whether R1579 was triggered by
P3533 and destroyed VTs all still arise in exactly the same form if
provisions take effect at the same time, but in the order they appear
in the Proposal.

Breaking the tie amounts to ordering the events. Yes, you can deny that
this is a temporal ordering. I might even agree with you. But it's
still a logical ordering - and that is enough to generate the puzzles
about the effect of R1579.

Morendil does not need to argue that there is a constructible moment
in time at which the condition in R1579 is met. Logical orderings are
as available to him as they are to you. If the provisions in P3533
are held to take place in a logical-but-not-temporal order, then
Morendil can accept this and argue that VTs ceased to have a Mintor
logically-but-not-temporally before they acquired a new one, and that
this is enough to satisfy R1579, which says nothing about moments of
time.

I make sense of this by distinguishing logical from temporal ordering.

Isn't this beginning to skate close to the edge of the 'severability'

But, as I've been trying to point out amidst all the clamour,
Morendil needn't rely on there being a constructible moment in time
at which VTs had no Mintor. He can say instead that all that is 
required to trigger R1579 is that its condition be satisfied, and
that this is a logical, not a temporal, matter. R1579 does not say
"if there is a constructible moment in time at which a Currency has
no Mintor..." - that's a temporal interpretation that you and others
have been imposing, in a reasonable attempt to get clear about R1579
actually means.

But you can't have it both ways: you can't insist on a temporal
reading of R1579 on the one hand, and repudiate a temporal reading
of the concept of 'ordering' on the other.

Without doubt, Agorans are the finest collection of tetrapyloctomists

It appears that Morendil and I have independently reached precisely
the same conclusions. This is a rare thing! And, I think, good evidence
that the position we are together defending is not lightly to be
dismissed.

Well, the *expressed* object is to get VTs into circulation. The

I too am mystified.  When did I suggest repealing Rule 376?  I was
speaking only of multiple provisions within a single Proposal, not of
conflicting provisions within different Proposals.

Anybody remember when it is improper to make a Proposal which sought
to amend or repeal a Rule which a previous Proposal sought to amend or
repeal, if that prior Proposal's Voting Period had not yet ended?

My remarks above can be explained as follows: you said that you
found the concept of 'infinitesimals' despicable, and would seek
to have it removed from the Ruleset entirely. I, and apparently
a number of other Players, see no difference, at least in effect,
between saying that a certain set of events occur sequentially,
separated by infinitesimal increments of time, and saying that
those events occur at the same time, but in a certain order.
That is, I don't think it makes any difference to the effect of
R376 whether we read it as implicitly employing the concept
of 'infinitesimal'. At any rate, I didn't realize when I wrote
the above that you think there is a big difference between Rules
like R376, which don't use the word 'infinitesimal', and Rules
like R1527, which do. So I took your attack on infinitesimals
to be an attack on R376 also.

Of course, I think you're mistaken that there's a big difference
between R376 and R1527, so I think your attack on infinitesimals
is an attack on R376, whether you think so or not.

c) is untrue [and thus a) is not cancelled] as long as Impeaching the
Chancellor is possible.

That last sentence is redundant; you've already defined all this as an
Official Document.

"The CotC selects a Judge from those Players eligible to Judge by randomly
choosing from a list containing each such Player's name a number of times
equal to eir Acuity.  In other words, a Player's chance of selection is
directly proportional to eir Acuity."

"The CotC is both authorised and required to increase by one the Acuity
of any Player with zero Acuity, if at least two of the Speaker, the CotC,
and the Justiciar request it within one week."
