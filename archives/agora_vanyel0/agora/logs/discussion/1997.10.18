I don't think we ever had such a Rule. We had a paradox Rule, but I
don't think it said anything about CFJs. About 2 years ago, I protoed
a Paradox CFJ Rule, but I never got it into a form I was satisfied with
and so never proposed it.

You still don't need to define 'Abandoning' to achieve that effect.
You just arrange things so that if the Speaker is Absent, and is
alleged to have Abandoned, they cease to be Speaker, the Speaker-Elect
becomes Speaker, and the old Speaker is deregistered, in that order.

I didn't leave it out: I got rid of it. There's no need to define
'Abandoning' as a state a Player can be in.

I suppose so, in that if you post to the PF 'X is Quiet' this could
be interpreted descriptively, or as actually causing the Player to
become Quiet. Is this really a problem?

Well we've actually had a CFJ, judged TRUE, that non-Players may
submit CFJs. So I take it that's well-established.

Ah, now that I doubt. A bald statement in the Rules will always override
any metagame principle which contradicts it.

My own view is that there is no such distinction with any legal
significance. In my view, Morendil is a non-Player and therefore
cannot be required to do anything by the Rules.

I think I was just speaking loosely. I think as the Rules are currently
written, strictly speaking, 'dismissal' is not a Judgement, which according
to R591, must be TRUE or FALSE.

My proto 'What is a Judgement?' would make dismissal a Judgement.
Do you object?

In my opinion, the arguments already adduced, particularly the new
one from Jeff about R1736, show that it is not the case that both
interpretations are supportable.

I think it probably is true that the Rules cannot (effectively)
place *obligations* on non-Players, ie, they cannot effectively
require a non-Player to do something. But they come close: they
can and do place *restrictions* on non-Players, eg on when some
recently deregistered non-Players can reregister.

An interesting point, but I don't think it can be pressed into service
here. Firstly, it says nothing about whether non-Players are permitted
to be Nominated; secondly, just because Morendil was deregistered during
the Nominating Period, that does not show that he would not be permitted
to hold the Office, quite apart from that fact that it's not at all clear
that non-Player aren't permitted to Hold Office. We might have passed a
Guillotine Proposal in the interim, granting Morendil an Amnesty and
reregistering him. I think shows the need to carefully rethink the above
provision.

There seems to be a consensus about that.

>3) However, Rule 1555 causes em to be immediately removed from Office.

Again that rather depends on how you interpret R1555. The Rule states
that "If an Officer.. is deregistered, e shall immediately be removed
from every Office e holds." Is being deregistered a continuous state
of a person, in which case we could say that Morendil is, right now,
in a state of being deregistered,  or is it a momentary event,
something that happens to them just at a particular time? I have to
say, I incline toward the event interpretation. Morendil is currently
not registered, but he is not currently deregistered - he was
deregistered for Lawlessness a few days ago.

I suspect that won't work for reasons given above. We need a much clearer
notion of what it means to say that a Candidate would not be permitted
to fill the Office.

Or, alternatively, upmutate R1006. Preferable I think. R1006 is a good
candidate for the middle tier of Rules.

I think you meant to say "I hereby allege that I have Abandoned the game".
According to the first paragraph of R1042, such a message sent to the
PF makes you Not Absent by virtue of being a message sent to the PF by
you. Assuming that you are Active, the second paragraph makes you Absent.
But the first paragraph states that you can only be exactly one of
Not Absent, Maybe Absent, Absent or Abandoning. Thus does R1042 tie
itself up into neat little knots.

I would have thought that if the Registrar denies the legality of
the deregistration, then it will be because the deregistration did not
really happen, eg because the Player alleged to have Abandoned was
not really Absent. I suspect that if you have a tendency to think
that illegal deregistrations are deregistrations that really have
occurred, only illegally, then no wording I can come up with is going
foreclose such a reading.

Hm. the third of these, I think. You're right it's not clear enough.
More revisions on the way...

Sure it does!  If Morendil had said "I issue an Injunction of the type
described by Rule 1736, ordering ..." etc. etc., then the presumption would
be that he had issued a single Injunction that was illegal because it was
against 1736, rather than an attempt to issue several injunctions that were
inappropriate and possibly illegal for other reasons.

Why would a Revolt be a nightmare? Not that I'm keen for a Revolt,
you understand (first against the wall when the revolution comes,
and all that). R1664 says that when a Revolt occurs, all Players
who hold Office are retired. Obviously that wouldn't include Morendil.

In any case, Morendil would no longer be Speaker-Elect, since he
becomes Speaker, which is not an Office, before all the Player
Office-holders are retired. Amazingly, none of the Rules which define
the Speaker (in particular, R103) say that the Speaker has to be a
Player, at least as far as I can see.

If Morendil does become our first non-Player Speaker (what a turn of
events!), I think I'd allege he was Tainted. We've never had a
Referendum on Speaker Taintedness before (and in these times of 
exploring new territory, that alone is a good reason to have one!),
and not being a Player sounds like solid grounds for Taintedness to me.

...except I didn't look very hard. The last sentence of R103 does
say that "Player" refers to Voters and the Speaker. So I guess
Morendil would be reregistered, or at least be a Player, whether
or not he counted as being registered.

I don't see that myself. As I read R103, nothing prevents you simply
from becoming our first non-Player Speaker.

What happens if a candidate is deregistered during the election
period? Are votes cast in favor of em then invalidated
retrospectively? That doesn't really appeal to me.

Why not require that in such a situation the election is to be
repeated (to allow voters who voted for the deregistered candidate to
change their votes - 1434 forbids that while the original election
period is still running).

Nominations of players who are deregistered during the nomination
period could be defined as implicit retractions in the sense of 1445.

I would have thought that if the Registrar denies the legality of
the deregistration, then it will be because the deregistration did not
really happen, eg because the Player alleged to have Abandoned was
not really Absent. I suspect that if you have a tendency to think
that illegal deregistrations are deregistrations that really have
occurred, only illegally, then no wording I can come up with is going
foreclose such a reading.
<<

Why not defer the actual deregistration until the registrar has
officially confirmed it? That would be similar to the PC paradigm:
players or officers can request currency transfers via POs/TOs, but
the recordkeepor has to note them (and can, e.g., find that a TO can
not be successfully executed due to lack of funds).

Similarly, the registrar could be the "recordkeepor" for players and
find that a requested deregistration did not actually happen for some
reason.

If Morendil had said "I issue an Injunction of the type
described by Rule 1736, ordering ..." etc. etc., then the presumption would
be that he had issued a single Injunction that was illegal because it was
against 1736, rather than an attempt to issue several injunctions that were
inappropriate and possibly illegal for other reasons.
<<

Makes sense. Now if Morendil never had used the word "injunction" at
all, simply stating "I issue the following POs" or some such phrase,
these would have been numerous inappropriate and possibly illegal
injunctions (but formally legal as far as 1736 is concerned), right?

I've made changes to meet objections and comments from Andre and
Zefram.  The extraneous 'a' in the second paragraph has gone; the
ambiguity of stating 'X is Quiet' is gone: you now make X Quiet by
alleging that e is Absent. Of course, 'X is Absent' is now ambiguous,
but not I think in the way that was bothering Zefram. If I'm wrong
about that, then I note that the current R1042, which Zefram wrote,
suffers from precisely the same ambiguity to which Zefram is objecting, 
which I would find odd. I have made it clearer what happens when it
is alleged that the Speaker has Abandoned the game, and I've changed
the reference to 'the legality of the deregistration' which was
bothering Andre to whether 'the deregistration has actually
occurred', which I hope is better. I maintain that there is no need
to define 'Abandoned' as a state a Player can be in.

####
Proto-Proposal
Straighten out Absence

This Proposal has an Adoption Index of 2.

[Comment: the terminology in R1042 has somehow gotten all twisted
up. I think this straightens it out. I've added a reporting requirement
for the Registrar. (Zefram?) I have also put the definition of Active
back in R1016 where it belongs.]

Be it hereby resolved that R1042 be amended to read:

      Each Player is either Here, Quiet or Absent. Whenever a
      Player posts to the Public Forum, or a new Player registers,
      that Player is Here.

      If a Player posts to the Public Forum clearly identifying 
      another Player who is Here, and alleging that that Player is
      Absent, then that Player becomes Quiet. If a Player has been
      Quiet continuously for two weeks, e becomes Absent. If a
      Player has been On Hold continuously for sixty days, e becomes
      Absent.

      Any Player can cause an Absent Player to be deregistered by
      stating in the Public Forum that the Absent Player has
      Abandoned the game. If the Speaker is Absent, and it is alleged
      in the Public Forum that e has Abandoned the Game, e commits
      the Class A Crime of Speaker Abandonment. E ceases to be
      Speaker, and the Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker. E is then
      deregistered. In either case, the Registrar shall confirm or
      deny that the deregistration has actually occurred in the
      Public Forum as soon as possible.

      The Registrar shall include in eir Report the most recent
      date on which each Player changed from being Here, Quiet or
      Absent to any of the others.

Be it further resolved that Rule 1016 be amended to read:

      At any time, each Player shall either be On Hold or Off Hold.
      This status shall not be changed except as specified in the
      Rules. For the purposes of the Rules, 'Active', 'not On Hold'
      and 'Off Hold' are all synonyms.  

      When a Player registers (or reregisters), e is Off Hold.

      An Active Player goes On Hold when e Moves to the Stasis
      Chamber.

      An On Hold Player becomes Active when e Moves from the Stasis
      Chamber.  E may not do so until at least 96 hours after e last
      went On Hold.

Ick, reuse of terminology - which is what we're trying to *fix*.  How about
replacing "that that Player is Absent" with "that that Player has Left"?

If the relevant time is specified as the end of the Election, would that

Dismissal is a disposition, but is not a judgement.  I would prefer

"The Registrar shall confirm or deny the actuality of such
deregistration."?

Still bothers me, because it introduces a potential uncertainty (is
Player X registered or not?).  I'd prefer to have the Player remain
registered until the Registrar makes an announcement.  Of course, the
present legal climate is inadequate to support such a system (since we
have no notion of tort, nor can a Judge issue an order "that X be
considered, for all intents and purposes, as though e were a Player
from time T forward" as rectification for improper deregistration).

Maybe. :)  What would the advantages be to making a dismissal

I have to say, I've never understood the rationale for that provision.

It is the "administrivia" option in the list configuration files.

There is also an "Approve: password" line you can insert before the
message to resend articles while bypassing all checks.

Read the list-owner-info file (now why didn't I get that when I started
maintaining the FRC list?), the majordomo manual page and the lists'
configuration files.

Well, I guess what I mean is that the Rules have a certain "sphere of 
influence", mostly related to Nomic Entities, etc. And of course all 
Players are within this sphere of influence, and their actions may be 
regulated and obligations may be placed upon them. People who are not 
playing Nomic only enter this sphere of influence when they do so 
directly; so the Rules have no authority over, say, President Clinton, 
unless he were trying to register to play the game, in which case a rule 
like "any head of state wishing to register must first declare Agora's 
birthday a national holiday in eir nation."

The disintction is or can be maintained among kinds of Judgements.
I want to be able to say that returning a Judgement is what Judges do.
So Judgement and 'ruling' become synonymous for us.

I played around with alternatives but they were all more awkward.

Heh. You can't please everybody. If I use the same term, Quiet, Zefram
objects. If I use a different term that I've already used, you object.
You suggest I use a different term that I haven't already used. Doubtless
someone will object that I haven't defined what 'Left' actually means.
So I'll add a definition of 'Left', and then you'll complain I'm
reusing terminology. Around we go.

What we're trying to fix is that you don't cause someone to Abandon
the game by stating that they have Abandoned the game. I've fixed that.
It's true that on the current wording, you don't make someone Quiet
by stating that they are Quiet - but Zefram objected to that. I think
it makes reasonable sense to make someone Quiet by stating that they
are Absent. Being Quiet is after all, a step on the road to being Absent.

That's more or less the wording I've moved to.

It bothers me, too, but I agree with you that we don't at present
have the resources to any better. What I've protoed is the best I
can come up with using the resources we do have.

Only the preservation of the natural idea that Judges return Judgements.
Anyway, read the proto and tell what you think. I'll forward you a copy.

Turning the administrivia option off will mean that bounces go the
list instead of to me, This means that you'll get all the bounces
without my having to do anything - but you'll also see all the other
administrative stuff that is currently hidden from view, such as
subscription and unsubscription requests. Are people happy with that?

An interesting example. It makes me doubt, or at least reconsider, my
previous assertion that the Rules cannot impose obligations, only
restrict, non-Players.

Consider a Rule which stated that "Before registering, non-Players
must deposit $US20 in the bank account of Agora Inc." Intuitively, I
think we want to say that such a Rule can be effective, in that the
Courts could justifiably strike down the registration of person who
had not made the required monetary deposit before registering. If we
accept that, we must accept that the Rules can place obligations on
non-Players.

The alternative, of course, is to deny that the Rule can be effective
in the sense given above. Would we be prepared to give up our intuition
that such a Rule is effective in order to maintain the intuition that
the Rule cannot place obligations on non-Players? I'm not sure what I
think.

No - for how can you be sure in advance what will be the case at the
end of the Election? If you want to discount votes for Candidates who
turn out to have been intuitively ineligible to hold Office (I say,
'intuitively' because it seems to have turned out that non-Players
can hold Office, out intuitions to the contrary notwithstanding), then
you can't perform the test when the votes are cast (which you'd like
to be able to do, understandably enough), but only when the Election is
over. It's only then that you know for sure which of the Candidates are
intuitively eligible. So the place to put the test is in that part of
the Rules for Elections which deal with tallying the votes at the end
of the VP.

Well, I don't mean to argue against myself here, but one possible 
solution is to interpret the rule to mean "No person may register who has 
not deposited $US20 in the bank account of Agora Inc."
