The offense in question would presumably be the Crime of Falsification,
defined in R1497 as the presentation "as correct [of] information
which e believes to be incorrect as part of a message to an Officer
which that Officer is then required to act upon...". Whether Harlequin
commits this Crime will come down to whether his request to Registrar
Zefram represents his address as being Antimatter's correct address.
I expect that Harlequin will argue that he made no allegation that
<harlequin@tmbg.org> really is Antimatter's address, only that
Registrar Zefram should note it as such. Such an argument is pretty
dubious, but you should probably make a CFJ and get an Official ruling.
[Although, if arguments in the style of Morendil become popular, this
may not do you much good. It'll be no use making a CFJ that "Harlequin
committed the Crime of Falsification by sending such-and such a message
to the PF", since a Judge will have to reach a decision without
interpreting R1497 - a tricky assignment!]

The rejoinder to that is "Why should he note is as such?"

I'll contemplate calling a CFJ on this issue.

The Board must necessarily consider any issue which bears to the
question placed before it.  In the Appeal of an Injunction, the Board
is specifically mandated by Rule 1695 to consider both the legality
and appropriateness of the Injunction which has been appealed.
Clearly, identifying criteria of appropriateness is an issue which
bears to the appropriateness of individual injunctions and is thus a
legitimate matter for consideration by the Board considering the
Appeal of an Injunction.

Scholars of American jurisprudence generally consider the case of
Marbury v. Madison, which confirmed the power of the Supreme Court to
strike down laws adjudged to be unconstitutional, to be one of the
most important cases in American legal history.  However, this
defining case was little more than a boring little writ of mandamus
filed directly in the Supreme Court by William Marbury, seeking an
order compelling Secretary of State James Madison to deliver Marbury's
commission as a federal magistrate and to pay him the salary due that
position.  Quite a mundane matter.  Would you hold that Chief Justice
Marshall and his fellow Justices were improper in considering whether
the Judiciary Act of 1789 was lawfully adopted in order to resolve
whether Mr. Marbury's application for mandamus should be granted?

The Notary is no longer defined at all.  My interpretation of this is
that anything depending on Notary actions will not be satisfied, and
anything requiring the Notary to act is vacuous.

The way I interpret the Executor being "empowered ... to act on behalf of
[an] entity, as if e was that entity" (R1478), it does not preclude the
possibility of an entity acting on its own behalf even if it is not its
own Executor.  Therefore, Antimatter is empowered to take game actions
on eir own behalf, in addition to Harlequin being empowered to act for em.

I have noted Antimatter's change of address.  (By the way, changing one's
preferred email address is of no legal consequence -- it certainly does
not affect the PF subscription requirement.)  I interpret Antimatter's
objection as having no effect -- e said "no e doesn't", which is simply
false, as e just did.

I am definitely not saying that - and I have to wonder to what extent
you are deliberately failing to understand what I've gone to some
trouble to explain. The above is no less a caricature of my own
argument than, by your lights, my interpretation is a caricature of
game custom in Judicial matters.

Not quite correct. My point is that *if* there is substantial doubt
as to whether a Judge is correctly interpreting a Rule, our Judicial
Rules ensure that this matter will be considered by a Board of
Appeals.

At the risk of oversimplifying, my contention is precisely that the
lower Court usually does not get to make definitive decisions as to
the interpretation of Rules; that is a privilege of our higher Court.

However, the decision of a Board of Appeals is also, in normal
circumstances, directly framed as a confirmation or a refutation of
a Judge's decision, and adresses the same issues that the original 
Judge adressed. This is, in my understanding of Agoran Judicial 
processes, most of what gives the Board of Appeals its authority.

Whereas the decision of the Board of Appeals in the case of the 1045 
Injunctions was reached without reference to any previous decision, 
discussion or argument. IMHO this makes it less convincing than a 
more conventional decision would be.

As an illustration, let me point out that the Board did not at any
time consider alternative interpretations of the phrase
'appropriate', and did not at any point justify their preferred
interpretation.

Lastly, this case is unusual in that the issue on which the Board of
Appeals returned a decision (that of the meaning of 'appropriate')
not only had not been considered in the original Judgement, but had 
also never (AFAIK) been considered by a Court previously. It is this 
last circumstance that IMHO makes this particular Board's decision 
suspect.

I seem to recall that I did; in particular that there was no reason
to narrowly interpret "appropriate to the situation" as "appropriate
in the context of what the Statement of the CFJ was referring to".

Consider two related examples; in eir Judgement on the Statement
"The CotC is not paid enough", by your interpretation Oerjan, it
would seem, would have been able to return an appropriate Injunction
ordering the Registrar to pay out 100 VTs to Andre. Conversely, were
one to CFJ on the Statement that "Rule 101 should be interpreted
such that the Players must abide by the Rules at all times", if the
Judge were to issue an Injunction to the Rulekeepor to annotate Rule
101 with the Statement, I for one would think it inappropriate.

I don't see anything of that nature in the current Ruleset.  Can you

Oh, come on. If anyone has lost perspective, it's you. Since when
has a Kudo transfer, justified or not, become a good reason for
forced deregistration ? Sheesh.

Maybe it's just me, but Lawlessness sounds like a pretty good reason
for forced deregistration.

Rule 1585/1 (Power=2)
Official Duties upon Officer Change

      Whenever the holder of an Office changes, any duties which the
      Rules had imposed upon the prior holder of that Office as a
      consequence of holding that Office which have not been fulfilled
      must instead be fulfilled by the new holder of that Office, as
      soon as possible after the change of Officer occurs and in the
      same order in which the prior holder of that Office had been
      required to fulfill them.

I don't read this as relaxing any timing requirements, only imposing
additional ones.  Anyway, the Infraction is defined as the *failure* to
post the Report -- any interpretation of R1585 could only ever absolve
you of the Rule violation (R1686), not the Infraction.

Well, I agree that his original comment about needing a month off based 
on what he saw as a fallacious argument was inappropriate. But I don't 
think the above qualifies as a boorish statement; he's making a 
rhetorical point there, not a personal attack.

I don't see that the rules stipulate that I am not my own Executor. They
may stipulate that Harlequin is my Executer, but that is not neccessarily
mutually exclusive with me being my own Executor.

I request to have my email changed back to what it was.

BTW, could someone tell me why this sentence in rule 1738 is ineffective?
"The Executor in Probate of an entity is the Executor of that entity, and
empowered only to submit Transfers Orders for that entity." I missed
Morendil's reasoning.

I'm about ready to make a couple of CFJs, including "Harlequin has
violated Rule 1738" ("... and shall do so in a timely manner."), but won't
just yet.

Hmm.  Interesting interpretation.  I think this better be put to a CFJ for
clarity's sake.  H. CotC, I hereby make the following Call for Judgement.

Rule 1714 should be interpreted such that an allegation of Lawlessness sent to
the PF must contain an explicit declaration that a particular Player is
Lawless.

Relevant Rules: 1714

Arguments:  Unfortunately, I can't think of any better argument at the moment
other than "intention".  Clearly R1714 was intended to make the reporting of
Lawlessness optional (and slightly dangerous).  Scott's interpretation makes
the reporting of Lawlessness mandatory and opens the Herald up to being
prosecuted for a Class A crime if e makes a mistake in reporting someone's
Blots while having no intention of alleging Lawlessness.

Hmm, this gives me an idea for another argument.  To "allege" something
requires intent on the part of the alleger.  The fact that the commission of a
crime can be inferred from someone's statement of fact does not mean that
someone has alleged that a crime has been committed.  Simply reporting a number
of Blots does not clearly identify the Herald's intentions wrt Lawlessness and
therefore cannot be considered equivalent to an explicit declaration that a
Player is Lawless.

Judges have often interpreted Rules in CFJs even when the Rule
interpretation was not the matter directly under consideration,
as stated in the CFJ's statement.  What evidence do you have
to support this assertion?

My apologies, but they shut the power off at the office this weekend, and since
it was closed on Monday, I couldn't get to the mail until today.  I'm still
catching up, but I will be releasing Promotor stuff as soon as I can.

There are enough references to "the Executor", "eir Executor" and so on
that it is clear that an entity can only have one Executor.

R1478 takes precedence due to having a lower number.

I note that this CFJ should probably be dismissed (or judged FALSE),

Actually, now that it's changed, can you officially act as you?  I mean, as
far as the game is concerned, Antimatter is registered as
<harlequin@tmbg.org>, which you are definitely not.

Myself, I had a notion that Lawlessness was a process whereby the
deregistration, due to the accumulation of failed duties and
therefore of various Infractions, of an inactive or particularly
stubborn Player charged with duties critical to game play could be
expedited.

I don't suppose this will come as a surprise ;) but I am concerned
that it can be viewed as a convenient way of putting on ice someone
whose actions one doesn't approve of, even though such actions stay
within the traditional bounds of scheming and scamming and are not in 
and of themselves particularly disruptive to the normal flow of the 
game.

I am, alas, of the opinion that Ronald Kunne's dictum ('Thou shalt
not make waves so high the boat capsizes') is becoming increasingly
descriptive of Agora. Not that I mind terribly - tacit Rules are just
as fun to play with as explicit Rules. But there's a risk that this
attitude might stifle the game's creative spirit.

This is quite untrue. Andre vacated only the POs from the Bank.
Those which your own COE listed; not those pertaining to
Infractions.

There is that. Then again, legislative intent is traditionally not
relevant. The problem can easily be fixed by amending the Rule to
"alleges, in these exact terms, that a Player is Lawless".

I don't think so - if I state that someone is a bastard, I am
alleging that e was born out of wedlock, whether I intended this
meaning or not.

The problem is that Lawlessness *is* equivalent to the possession of 
a certain number of Blots - thus, as Scott remarked, one statement is 
legally equivalent to the other.

But then, never without the possibility that a Board of Appeals might 
not reverse such an interpretation. This IMHO constitutes an adequate 
safeguard against Judges abusing this authority, a safeguard which 
does not exist when a Board of Appeals is in a situation of handing 
down an interpretive decision de novo.

All the Rules concerning Appeals. :)

The Rules place no significance on preferred email addresses.  Antimatter
is the person Ross Morgan-Linial, who has today posted to the PF and
taken some game actions.

I contest that it is the case that "as far as the game in concerned,
Antimatter is registered as <harlequin@tmbg.org>".  Many Players have
had multiple email addresses without specifically registering those
addresses.  The game establishes no formal connection between email
addresses and Player identity as far as I can tell; the only reasons
for the reporting requirement that I can see are to provide the
Registrar with the information e needs to maintan the directory of
Players.

All that aside, I do believe that Harlequin committed a TIA violation
by presenting to Zefram the claim that Antimatter's preferred email
address is <harlequin@tmbg.org>.  Quite clearly, Antimatter's
preferred email address is not <harlequin@tmbg.org>, and I believe
that Harlequin knew (or reasonably should have known) this when he
presented that claim to the Registrar.  I should probably CFJ on this.

It's not that simple.  From previous discussions it has been made clear that a
Player is the *person* who is registered, not the address.  The question then
is, who is the person that is Antimatter?  The Rules make it clear that one
person cannot be registered as two different Players.  Therefore Harlequin (or
any other Player besides Antimatter emself) cannot be that person.  The only
logical choice is that the real Antimatter (the real person) is still the
person who is registered.  So, can Antimatter, the person, be eir own Executor.
 I don't see anything in the Rules that prevents it.

I would disagree with this, since "bastard" now has a colloquial meaning
unrelated to one's circumstances of birth.

Yes, the two statments are logically equivalent, but there *is* a difference
between them, in the intention of the speaker of the two statements.  Will the
law recognize that difference?

I am perplexed at the notion (which you seem to be espousing) that
Boards of Appeals are not entitled to "write case law", as it were.
It seems to me that this is a power unavoidably inherent in judicial
officers of all sorts.  It seems exceedingly artificial to hold that
this power is, or even should be, restricted only to those judges
whose opinions may suffer being overturned.  (This certainly is not
true in the United States; if anything, the judges who are in greatest
possession of this power are those of the Supreme Court, whose
opinions cannot be overturned or set aside by anything other than a
later act of that same Court or an amendment to the Constitution.)

Norwegian certainly has no problem adding intonation to the pattern. It
probably helps that words differing only in tone are about as rare as
other homonyms, and that tone doesn't apply to one-syllable words.

I have read (probably in sci.lang) that in Cantonese Chinese the word
tones (6 or 7) are important enough that pop music takes them into
account, while this is not the case in Mandarin Chinese (4 tones).

Greetings,
rjan.

I think his point, with which I don't agree, is that the Board of Appeals 
is not entitled to "write case law" unless that case law is either in 
support of or contradicting some specific "case law" written by the 
original judge. Correct me if I'm wrong, Morendil.

More accurately, IMO, nothing in the Rules prevents Antimatter from
acting on his own behalf.  He is not his own Executor (in part because
he is not registered) but he can definitely act on his own behalf.

Not a problem.  There is nothing in the Rules which states that
messages from a Player must come from that Player's registered
address.  In fact, Players have occasionally sent messages from addresses
other than their primary ones, and the legitimacy of such messages has
never been challenged.

Remember: a Player is a person, not an email address.

Oh sure. Quite a few of us have been down this road before, in fact,
some more than once. But you'll have to agree that of all the
penalties that were ever in force in this game, enforced
deregistration, though only temporary, is by far the most severe,
blurring as it does the line between 'play' penalties - transferring
Kudos or Currencies or taking away Offices and more 'concrete'
penalties - in this instance actually keeping a person away from a
favorite game. 

Sure, I know 'keeping away' is too strong a word; I was never
'there' in any sense, and there's arguably a sliver of a difference
between being deregistered and being registered. But then, we all
have a keen appreciation of this difference.

To pursue your analogy, Lawlessness is a sharp instrument - I do not
think it should be wielded lightly. More people might get cut than
we'd care.

Not too far off the mark. 

I'd elaborate and add that I recall cases where Justices handed down
decisions on matters only peripherally related to the issues at
hand, and that I'm only enunciating that as a principle that is, or
should be, be part of the implied rules of judicial conduct in Agora.
I just offered an example in a different post (what if the Board of
Appeals in CFJ 987 had handed down the same decision as the Board in
1045 did ?)


Also that I'm only claiming validity for this principle in Agora,
beause of the extreme simplicity and lack of elaborate protections
compared to RL law.

Lastly, that in the present instance the Board of Appeals did in a
sense reach a decision in contradiction to one reached by the
original Judge; they just failed to adequately justify their
authority to do so, which IMHO would have required a more detailed
discussion of the underpinnings of their intepretation of
'appropriate to the situation'.

> I am perplexed at the notion (which you seem to be espousing) that

I agree that in the majority of cases they are. But this authority
derives from the context in which this is done. OK, time for a
thought experiment. Suppose the Board of Appeals had decided, in
Judging the Appeal of Zefram's Judgement of TRUE in CFJ
whatever-it-was, to overturn and dismiss the Judgement on the grounds
that Rule 1695 should be interpreted to mean that Injunctions are
'appropriate' when the Justices feel that they are.

Such a decision would have been suspect, wouldn't it ? The reason why 
it would have been suspect is that the Board did not _have_ to take a 
decision in the matter, before deciding that Zefram's Judgement 
should be dismissed.

The case at hand is different, in that the Board did have to
consider the appropriateness of the Injunctions before it. But the
Board was, however, under no obligation to overturn my own notion of
'appropriateness'; the Rules are silent on what this covers, and no
previous Game Custom existed as to this notion - except for my own
issuance of the Injunctions.

Did the Justices consider 'other standards' ? It seems plain that 
they did not. Justice Steve wrote :

   (...) it is plain that the Injunctions were inappropriate for the
   situation: they have nothing whatsoever to do with the matter that
   Morendil was asked to consider in his Judgement.

Justice elJefe wrote :

   It is clear that the Injunctions were all inappropriate for the
   situation of the CFJ.  "Appropriate for the situation," in the clear
   sense of the Rule, would mean that the injunction was a natural and
   expected result of the Statement being found TRUE.  In this case
   there is simply no reasonable way to connect the Statement (that CFJs
   945-970 and 972-1044 must be dismissed under Rule 1563) to the
   Injunctions (that various Officers distribute currencies to the
   masses).

Both handed down a particular decision as to what constitutes
'appropriateness', not in the form of a contradictory argumentation
buttressed by appeals to such authorities as the Rules or Game
Custom. One could argue their statements follow from common sense,
but this is clearly stretching things too far; without prompting, 
Steve was readily able to come up with an alternative reading of 
'appropriate' that does not necessarily involve the narrow context of 
the CFJ. (Actually, I think the proper focus of debate in this 
instance is the phrase 'the situation' rather than 'appropriate'.)

Actually, I am saying the converse - that this power shouldn't be,
and possibly isn't, granted to Justices whose *initial* opinions may 
not be overturned.

I am aware of that - I read up on S.C. decisions a while ago, it 
makes for very entertaining reading. :)

I think the Lawlessness Rule should be Amended somewhat - I think "30
Overdue Blots" might be better, and perhaps even "non-disputed", although
in that case there should be a way to make a decision about a PO final so
that it cannot be made indefinitely disputed by constantly making new
CFJs.

And of course make the reporting truly voluntary, as I originally intended
(darn, so far Indulgences had seemed bug-free...)

I think we should have a stronger Double Jeopardy Rule too, based on not
applying an Infraction more than once per message.

Greetings,
rjan.

I phrased that badly; I meant, "with which I don't necessarily agree." I 
do not have a strong viewpoint on the subject, as I have not had time to 
follow it fully.

Yep. Very practical, since email hosts have this tendency of breaking down

There was some noise the one or two times someone posted anynomously,
though.

Letting Disputed Blots stay Blots is a good way of limiting frivolous 
CFJs. I like having Lawlessness apply to Overdue Blots - this gives 
one a chance to do something about it.

Hmm, you can fit a Chromatic Repeal into one message. I like D.J.
just as it is; I think a strong case can - and will - be made that
even if Rule 663 doesn't mandate that the Judgement of 1045
contained only 4 Injunctions, then Double Jeopardy dictates that
whatever the number of Infractions committed as a result of these
Injuctions, there should be at most 4 distinct penalties incurred.

It hinges on what you define to be 'single act', and it seems
reasonable to assume that the posting of one single sentence to the
PF which has legal repercussions cannot be broken down into many
"single acts" for the purposes of 1652, as long as we make a
distinction between 'natural' actions - among which we'd include
utterances by Players - as opposed to 'legal' actions, i.e.
specifying multiple Currency Transfers in a sentence such as "I
hereby transfer as many VTs to the Banks as are necessary to satisfy
all POs".

There is some room in R1465 for this interpretation, but I note
firstly that nothing would have prevented me from aking 7 separate
announcements of the Wins, and this would probably have removed
what little room for manoeuvre there is, and secondly, there is
game custom that multiple simultaneous wins result in multiple
payments of the Champion's Rewards: Crito was paid multiple times
for his scam Wins.

Did the Group possess any Currencies? If so, it is now a terminal
estate and will require an EiP as soon as we have a Notary again.
See Rules 1601 and 1738.

This is all getting very interesting.

And if that weren't enough, R1478 states that "Except when the Rules
stipulate otherwise, a Player is eir own Executor." Since the Rules
do in this case stipulate otherwise, we should conclude that only
Harlequin is Antimatter's Executor.

Here, however, we appear to disagree. I am of the opinion that only
a Player's Executor is empowered to act on behalf of that Player.
So I don't think Antimatter can change his address, or deregister
for that matter, unless Harlequin sends the relevant messages.

I think you do make an interesting point about Judicial process here,
but nevertheless, on its own it does nothing to show that there is
anything wrong with the actual decision handed down by the Board.
It's an argument only for thinking about changing certain aspects of
the way Appeals of Injunctions are handled. Perhaps we should hand them
to a Judge first, rather than straight to the Board of Appeals. The
Judge's decision could then be Appealed if it were unsatisfactory. 
This potentially lengthens the process, but addresses the concerns
about justice you raise here.

R1478: "Except when the Rules stipulate otherwise, a Player is eir
own Executor." When the Rule do stipulate otherwise, a Player is not
eir Executor. The Rules stipulate that Harlequin is Antimatter's
Executor. So Antimatter is not eir own Executor.

There's a further question about whether this means Antimatter is
disempowered to act on eir own behalf. I think so. Zefram disagrees.

No, it did not (although it lost quite a bit in PC--13 VTs and

The reasoning being, I assume, that Antimatter is Ross Morgan-Linial,
and that Ross therefore has the right to deregister. Even if we
interpret the Rules on Executorship as giving Harlequin sole
authority to act on Antimatter's behalf (as I do), to the extent that
these Rules would deprive Ross of his right to deregister, they
conflict with R113, a very high-Powered Rule.

It would appear, therefore, that Antimatter is safe until November 1,
at which time Harlequin will be able to reregister him (assuming
we haven't enacted a legislative remedy by then).

I would argue that I committed no such action. Why? Firstly, because I
see no reason that the e-mail address of a Player should neccesarily
be one at which the person who is that Player regularly reads mail,
if there is a unique situation such as this one, where the executor
of a Player is not that Player eirself. And secondly, because I *did*
believe the game move I was taking to be legal, aided in no small 
part by the numerous posts suggesting that Morendil do the same thing.

I can promise you I won't make silly arguments about a judge's ability to
interpret Rules in Judging a CFJ.

Evidence he wants. I don't think there's much evidence on one side or
the other, particularly. I think both sides are offering interpretations
of ambiguous Rules. 

Here, however, is an argument: I think both sides agree that
Antimatter has only one Executor, and that is Harlequin. This is a
consequence of R1478's provision that "Except when the Rules
stipulate otherwise, a Player is eir own Executor." together with
the observation that the Rules do stipulate otherwise.

What we disagree about is whether Antimatter is empowered to act on
his own behalf, even if he not his own Executor. But now notice that
R1478 also states that "The Executor of an entity is a Player who is
empowered by the Rules to act on behalf of that entity, as if e was
that entity." I think that if Antimatter were so empowered, then he
would count as his own Executor, and this contradicts our starting
assumption that only Harlequin is Antimatter's Executor.

Objection: this just shows that we were wrong to accept that starting
assumption in the first place.

Reply: No, we were right to accept that starting assumption. The Rules
do clearly make Harlequin and only Harlequin Antimatter's Executor.
The Rules do not clearly grant Antimatter the power to act on his own
behalf; this is simply being assumed to be the case, which makes the
argument circular.  

NB when I say 'the power to act on his own behalf', I mean the power
in general. I agree with elJefe that R113 overrides R1478 and grants
Antimatter the right and therefore the power to deregister on his own
behalf, since the right would be useless without the power.

On the other hand, reading R1478 again with this distinction between
power in general and power in specific cases in mind, I note that
there's nothing in R1478 which suggests that to be an Executor is
to have power to act in general. One might with equal consistency
read it as saying that any Player who has the right to act on behalf
of another Player, even if only in specific cases, is that Player's
Executor. On that reading the Rules - specifically, R113 - *do* make
Antimatter his own Executor, since he is empowered to deregister himself.

Where would that leave us? If we took that view of R1478 (and remember,
it's not forced upon us), we'd have to say that since every Player
always has the right to deregister, every Player is always empowered
to act on eir own behalf, and hence every Player is always eir own
Executor. That's not unreasonable, and indeed amounts to the position
you've been arguing for: every Player is always eir own Executor, and
in some cases Players also have an additional Executor.

If we take the other view of R1478, a Player only conts as eir own
Executor if he the power in general to act on behalf of that entity,
as if e were that entity. On that reading, the right to deregister
alone does not make you your own Executor. The onus would then be on
you to show why we should think a Player who is not eir own Executor
is generally empowered to act on eir own behalf.

Why all this is very amusing, I must interject a dose of common sense.
Why ever did we pass the Rules for Probate, and Wills, etc.? Simply

of a deregistered Player to the Bank, or among the Players. This
would mean a Player is responsible for handling his own estate if
he doesn't want everything lost.
