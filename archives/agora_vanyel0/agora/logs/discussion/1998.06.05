I agree with this analysis. But why wouldn't the same reasoning
hold for SLCs - after all, they're just bodies of text, which
exist independently of the Rules. Does this show that something is
wrong with R1513?

I think more that it shows that there is a problem with the concept of
Nomic Entities.  But I believe we've had this discussion before.

It may be time to have it again though, in the new post-PC environment.

I think the problem may arise from people trying to do things with the
Nomic Entity concept that the concept was never intended to deal with.
I still think there's a distinction between things like Kudos, Voting
Tokens and (potentially) Plots, which I think of as Nomic Entities in the
sense of R1586, and things like Players, Rules, SLCs, Orders, Annotations,
Official Reports and so on, which I think are not Nomic Entities.

Here are some questions it occurs to me to ask though: even if the
distinction is a perfectly valid one, have we now reached a position,
post-PC, where there's nothing really useful that the distinction
can do for us? Has PC given us the resources to answer the questions
about changes to and continuity of (the properties of) Nomic Entities
which R1586 was designed to answer? Or is there still a role for a
Rule like R1586 to play?

After my last proposal failed quorum, I've decided that I have very
little to gain by voting or declaring presence on other people's
proposals without being offered something in return.
