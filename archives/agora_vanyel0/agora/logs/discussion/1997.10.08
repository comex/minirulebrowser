Very interesting!  However, I think there is a flaw in your
analysis: when you say, "You can't dismiss it, because then you
should judge it FALSE," you really ought to say, "You can't
dismiss it on the grounds that it is irrelevant, because then
you should judge it FALSE."  You may well be able to dismiss
the statement on other grounds.

I think I'm beginning to see Vir's point.  Let me state it
as I understand it.

CFJ 2001: The proper judgement of CFJ 2001 is TRUE.

I now think that perhaps this can be dismissed as irrelevant
to the Rules.  If it should be dismissed as irrelevant, then
there is no need to determine the proper judgement (recall
a dismissal is not a judgement), and thus its truth-value
*is* irrelevant!  (The statement is probably meaningless
as well, since there is no proper judgement of CFJ 2001.)
A bit circular, I know, but along similar lines, if we
eliminated 1565(iii) and 1565(vi), a judgement of
either TRUE or FALSE would be legal for a statement
"This statement is TRUE," and the logic supporting either
judgement would be equally circular.

I disagree.  Rules 1030 and 1482 define precedence only when Rules
conflict.  (And wisely so, IMO, since it is meaningless to talk
about precedence between Rules which do not conflict.)

Ah, but it's R1738 that defines the precedence to which we are referring:

Rule 1738/0 (Power=1)
Executors in Probate

      <snip>

      The Executor in Probate of an entity is the Executor of that
      entity, and empowered only to submit Transfers Orders for that
      entity.  An Executor in Probate also has the power to execute
      and vacate certain Payment Orders, as specified by the Probate
      Code.  This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which
      would specify a different Executor for an entity in Probate.

       <snip>

Note that it says any other Rule which *would* specify a different Executor
for an entity in Probate.  In the case where the EiP is not the estate in
Probate (which is always), R1482 *would* specify a different Executor for
an entity in Probate, and therefore, under all conditions would R1738 take
precedence over R1482.

I'd like to note that if R1738 were amended to add the sentence "The
Executor of an entity not in Probate is that entity.", then that would
override R1478.

I disagree with "Blob is ... eir own Executor in Probate"; nothing

I think so, yes.

I disagree with part 2:  You can dismiss it even if it's false, just as
you can dismiss "Water is not wet" even though that statement is false.

IMO, "Executor in Probate" is a specific sort of Executor only because
R1738 says so - that is, the suggested fix to R1738 "An Entity's EiP is
not eir Executor, but is empowered to..." would succeed in making EiPs
stop being Executors.

This is a good point; if the statement is false, then it's not relevant, 
in which case you may dismiss it even though it's false.

Something did: Elde's ceasing to be a Player. An Executor in Probate
is kind of Executor. An Executor is a kind of Player. A non-Player
such as Elde cannot be an Executor (definition of Executor in R1478),
and so he cannot be an Executor in Probate.

I disagree with your example.  I would dismiss it as irrelevant to the
rules, its claims to the contrary.  The fact that it is also false is
not relevant.

I note that R1478 says pretty much exactly that:

      Except when the Rules stipulate otherwise, a Player is eir own
      Executor. 

I also claim that the Rules do not stipulate otherwise. Elde cannot
be Blob's Executor because he is not a Player; therefore he cannot
be Blob's Executor in Probate. I conclude that R1478 and R1728 agree
that Blob is eir own Executor, and eir own Executor in Probate.

Good point. Oh well, I started out agreeing with Vir anyway; I was
just playing devil's advocate. Apparently it worked: in the course of
pointing out my logical mistakes, Chuck seems to have convinced
himself that Vir was right, too. I believe this is known in philosophy
as 'the Socratic method'. :)

True enough, but you do agree that as things stand, an Executor in
Probate *is* a kind of Executor, and therefore that Elde cannot be
one.

Oh, well, of course, it makes no *practical* difference...but I'm a
philosopher - I'm interested in the question for its own sake :)

Besides, the question of how to interpret R108 has broader implications
beyond the present case.

Yes, I am.  There is a specific provision that an entity's EiP is also
eir Executor -- I view this provision as being separable from the rest
of the Rule.

So it would normally seem.  In this case, both Rules can be satisfied
simultaneously, but doing so brings about a situation in which they
do conflict.

But R1738 explicitly states that an entity's EiP is eir Executor.
There's no need to regard the terms as being linked in that manner.

I agree that the game custom concerning the treatment of R1551 by
P3445 is pretty weak. But I actually think there's an independent
line of argument from game custom which provides additional support
to the sequential view. This support comes from how we treat the very
similar case of multiple Proposals adopted at the same time.  R376
basically legislates the sequential view for Proposals: each Proposal
is applied individually, and the Rules may act on the intermediate
game states. I think it's a very natural move to extend that
treatment to multiple provisions in a single Proposal, particularly
when you consider the evolution of the game over time from the single
provision per Proposal model we began with to the multiple provisions
per Proposal model we have now. This both allows us to see why the
Rules are silent on the issue, and reinforces the naturalness of
extending the sequential view of Proposals we already have to cover
provisions.

I think you've forgotten how most null-amendments actually occur:
not as the result of attempts to modify high-Powered Rules by
Proposals of insufficient Power, but simply as the result of
mistakes in quoting the text to be replaced. The second amendment
to R1551 in P3445 is a case in point. It is not *prohibited* by any
Rule, it simply doesn't occur. The fact that we count this as a
null-amendment indicates to me that we have a functional, or
algorithmic, or recipe view of how provisions in a Proposal are
applied. If a particular provision instructs us to replace text
A in Rule R with text B - and there is no text A in Rule R - we
still attempt to apply the provision, and hence we count the
amendment. On the atomic view this application is invisible, on
the sequential view, it is not, or need not be.

Another way of putting this point would be to say that we don't have
to give up on the definition of an Amendment as a change to the text
of a Rule; we only have to slightly extend our concept of 'change'
to include the degenerate case of the null-change. Multiplying by
1 is still multiplication, adding 0 is still addition - and replacing
non-existent text is still amending. That's how I see things, anyway.

The objection is not to your treating them as distinct - we all agree
that an Executor is a different kind of thing to an Executor in Probate.
The objection is to your treating them as unrelated. An Executor in
Probate is a kind of Executor. Elde cannot be Blob's EiP because he
cannot be Blob's Executor - he is not a Player.

So says R1738, but R1478 disagrees.

However, I agree that this is a possible interpretation of R1738.
I did deal with this in my analysis: it means that Blob is (temporarily)
eir own Executor, and has no EiP, and the Notary must select a new EiP.
I do not think that even this interpretation that an EiP is a type of
Executor can support a view that Blob is automatically eir own EiP.

I don't follow this.  Why can't you dismiss it?  Dismissal is not a

Not that it matters, since the lack of VTs necessarily forces all

Which part of 1478 do you read as irreconcilable with 1738's 
designation of an EiP as a particular class of Executor ?

We have assumed that an "Executor in Probate" is a kind of "Executor"; not
from precedence relation amongst the Rules, but from the meaning of the
words.  If the terms are completely separable as this suggests, then EiP
Morendil was not an Executor and could not have registered Elde at all.

To clarify: R1738 alone gives the impression that an EiP is a kind
of Executor.  R1478, in the case of a non-Player EiP, determines that
an EiP designated by R1738 can't also be an Executor.

R1738 states that an EiP is also an Executor.  It's only when the EiP
is not a Player that R1478 steps in and prevents em also being Executor.

The fact that one interpretation would make this sentence redundant,
while the other does not, should not be taken as evidence in
favor of the latter interpretation.  (At least not strong
evidence.)

What about the clause in R1738: This Rule takes precedence over any other
Rule which would specify a different Executor for an entity in Probate.
R1478 *would* specify a different Executor (namely, a player), and
therefore, the entire R1738 takes precedence over the entire R1478, which
includes the clause: Any other entity has an Executor only when the Rules
specify either a Player or a means to designate a Player to be the Executor
of that entity.

Okay... I mis-typed :)  That didn't sound the way it was meant.  I meant
that I don't have very many reasons to choose one candidate over onother.
I would always at least declare presence on an election :)

I am generally uncomfortable expanding provisions applying
to particular situations into more general principles.  For
example, I also refused to create a general principle of "game
actions may not be simultaneous" based on the fact that actions
in messages were ordered, in CFJ NNN, where I ruled that
multiple currency transfers could take place simultaneously.
(This was prior to the adoption of PC.)

No, I have not forgotten--in fact, Game Custom also holds
that attempts to modify high-Powered Rules by low-Powered
Proposals are not Amendments at all.

I don't follow this--why would this have to be invisible in
the atomic model?  Although the change (or lack thereof)
might be invisible, the provision in the proposal attempting
the change is not.

>Another way of putting this point would be to say that we don't have

I considered this and rejected it.  If a null-change is also
a change, then can't one say there have been infinitely many
null-changes to a Rule, and thus every Rule should have
an infinite amendment number?

The obvious objection to this is that Rule 116 states that
Rule Changes can only take place as permitted by the Rules,
and thus, null-changes do not take place at arbitrary times.
but in doing so you admit a difference between "a null-change"
and "no change at all."  Thus, a null-change is more than
simply a lack of a change.  How do we know that Proposal
3001 appplies a null-amendment to Rule 2525, but 3002
makes no change at all?  As you correctly note, 3001 attempts to amend
2525, and is not prevented from doing so by any Rule (such
as Power requirements), while 3002 makes no allegation of
changing 2525 at all.  But in making this determination,
we have looked at the provisions of the proposals, and
the atomic model can do that as easily as the sequential.

To put it another way: to use the first definition of
"Amendment" I suggested ("a change to the text of a Rule"),
to determine how many Amendments took place, we would have to look only
at the state of the Rule before the proposal took effect, its
state after it took effect, and intermediate states, if any.
But the Game Custom of Null-Amendments cannot (as far as
I can see) be reconciled with any method of counting Amendments
only by looking at the state of a Rule--given this custom,
any definition of Amendment must look "inside" a Proposal
to determine whether an Amendment (or how many) has taken
place, and the atomic view can look inside a Proposal just
as easily as the sequential view can.  Once we have a
definition of "Amendment" which includes looking at the mechanism
of a Proposal, we must admit that even the atomic model may
view two alleged Amendments in a single Proposal as two
actual Amendments.

The forces of nature seem to be against poor Kolja A. 

Apparently, his On Hold message was sent almost 6 minutes backwards in
time and so reached the PF almost 4 minutes before his Nomination. 

Greetings,

Not quite; 1738 does state that an EiP is an Executor. Now, if it is
indeed the case that 1478 conflicts with 1738, and actually
prohibits a Player's Executor to be other than that Player emself,
it makes on the other hands no stipulations as to who the Executor
of a *non-Player* can be - thus 1738 was in any case fully effective
in granting me the authority to register on the behalf of Elde.

Zefram's interpretation would OTOH make all my later actions on
Elde's behalf ineffective, including my reregistering Blob via Elde.

The PF isn't a proper venue for propagandizing, I believe. At least 
not until our Public Voting Experiment starts. ;)

I have reasons for aiming to become the next Speaker, which also have
to do with my nominating for - and being elected to - Ambassador; in
a nutshell, I want to pursue a political agenda that includes, among
other things, the 'Speaker as Head of State' proto that I posted a
while back (and didn't elaborate on for lack of time, but I think
that will no longer be such a problem), a stronger drive to recruit
new Agorans, more concrete diplomatic relations between Nomic, and a
completely novel concept for an Agoran "economy". I will naturally
expand on all of the above in much more detail as time goes by.

But I'd also like to point out that the good General has already had
a turn at Speaker - the desire, if it exists, for a change in that
area should be reason enough to Vote for me.

That's stretching things a bit. It seems just as sound to interpret 
1478 as stating that a non-Player cannot be an Executor, in Probate 
or otherwise. Your interpretation would also require us to read 1738 
as conflicting with 1478 as soon as a Player was initially assigned 
an EiP by the Notary, not just if and when that EiP later 
deregistered.

Recall that 1738 states "The Executor in Probate of an entity is the
Executor of that entity". Now 1478 states "Except when the Rules
stipulate otherwise, a Player is eir own Executor." But your 
interpretation is tantamount to claiming that 1738 does *not* 
stipulate otherwise. IOW you can't have it both ways: either the 
Executor in Probate is a special kind of Executor, in which case only 
Players can be EiPs, or Rule 1738 always fails to make the Executor 
of a Player someone else than emself.

On the other hand, it's not great form to Nominate for an Office, and
then immediately go On Hold.

Especially since if elected, one would be immediately removed. :)

Well, that's what I meant. Of course, Kolja might well be intending
to be Off Hold before being Elected - but we don't know that, do we?
And even if we knew of his intention, we couldn't know whether he
would be able to honour it.

Well, he gave a specific reason, and it's only for a week. I see nothing 
wrong with that.

No allegation of registration is made by the inclusion of an Entity in
the Assessor's Report of Voting Token Holdings.  Elde is listed
because e owns Voting Tokens.  Blob is not listed because he does not.
