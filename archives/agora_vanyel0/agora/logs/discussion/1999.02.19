By the time the Proposals were distributed, it would have been too late.
I think you'rem missing my point, which is that R1873 is not concerned

What I ment to raise was the point of the difference between, the player 
and the person.  As has now been metioned in other discussions.  I 
should say exactly what I mean in the future and then give an example...

I prefer to keep paragraph 2 of Rule 698 minimal.  On the other hand, the
use of "Barred by the Caller" in the rest of Rule 698 would need changing,

I think you're missing the entire point, which is that because e can

Might we try an analogy ? I'm driving a car and have a passenger. 
After a moment I get tired and ask em to take the wheel - with the 
understanding, of course, that I can at any time get back in the 
driver's seat. Suddenly, we crash and total the car. The insurance 
company is keenly interested in who had 'effective control' at the 
time of the crash, since my policy states that I am covered only when 
the car is under my 'effective control'. Now, the insurance company 
will probably argue that at the time of the crash, I was definitely 
not in control of the car, but my friend was, although I could at any 
time have assumed control again - the point is that *at that time* I 
wasn't actually driving.

If you want to make that closer to the situation in Agora we're
discussing, think of a car used for driving lessons, with one wheel
(and set of pedals) on the driver's side, used by the student, and
the same on the passenger's side, used by the teachers; in such cars,
the teacher's controls always override the student's. So the teacher
can let the student drive, while at any time having the possibility
to turn, brake, whatever. The teacher has told the student to go
ahead and drive, and is enjoying the ride - when they pass a radar
speed meter. They are 5mph over the speed limit, and the speeding
ticket goes to whoever has 'effective control' of the vehicle. Who 
gets it ?

In that case it might be an idea to streamline the difference between
Barred and Ineligible.  I suggest using Barred as a general term for those
who should only be allowed to judge as a final last resort.  Then the
Caller should be Barred.

In Minnesota, you can be "in control" of a motor vehicle while asleep
under a blanket in the back seat.

But in this case we aren't talking about a specific action taken
by Steve (for which he would be rightly responsible), but about
the nonperformance of an obligation by Kolja. If you are
obligated to pay a car tax, you can't relieve yourself of that
duty by lending the vehicle to a friend (an official sale is
another matter--Kolja could have transferred all his assets to 
Steve to be returned later). If I decide to have a friend type
all my e-mail for the next week, does that relieve me of "effective
control" of my assets? Kolja could have voted by posting a single
message to the PF. In that respect, he was no more disadvantaged
than any other Player.
  Again, some Players are hung up on the fact that Kolja didn't
in fact give up his PoA. I submit that that is irrelevant, what
matters is whether or not Steve embezzled Kolja's funds. The
fact that he did not do that trumps all.

Another hypothesis (unless this is what Chuck's 2nd savings and
loan contest is all about): What if one were to escrow one's funds
in a contest whose ordinances only allowed withdrawals at
certain times. Does this deprive one of "effective control". Again,
I'd say not, since one is always free to leave one's contest.
Even if one weren't , I'd say probably yes, since it is possible
to plan ahead and make withdrawals if necessary.

No, it doesn't trump all.  I think those arguing in favor of Kolja's
retaining "effective control" are glossing over this issue too
easily.  Once Kolja gave eir PoA to Steve, it  became *impossible*
for em to prevent Steve from embezzling funds without foreknowledge
of Steve's intentions and the timing of eir actions.  This constitutes
diminished control over those funds, since Kolja is not omniscient nor
omniprescient, even if Steve did not actually perpetrate the deed.
The question is whether this diminishment of control brings it below
the standard of "effective" control.  So far, all arguments seem to be
to be denying any such diminishment, rather than dealing with it
directly.

I am beginning to lean toward the viewpoint that "effective
control" does not necessarily mean "exclusive control".  If we had
left out that word "sole" in "sole executor", I don't think we would
be having this argument.  We would be saying that both Players
have effective control over those assets at the same time, even
though it would still be possible for Steve to "embezzle" funds
from Kolja by making a transfer that e would not want done.
The fact that the Rules allow Kolja to mimic this situation
by judicious use of revocation and reinstatement of PoA *is*
a compelling argument for this being "effective control".

OTOH, Steve also has a compelling argument from an historical
perspective.  The fact that Kolja did *not* revoke PoA at the
time of the proposal distribution means that Kolja was not the
Executor for eir VTs at that time.  Nothing can change that now,
even though Kolja *could* have revoked PoA before then.  So
in order to rule against Steve, you have to take on the somewhat
counterintuitive notion that it is not necessary for you to actually *be*
the Executor wrt an asset in order to have effective control over it.
But you do have to have the ability to *make* yourself Executor

Oops, I just noticed this typo.  This sentence will have no effect
(unless you want to try to make the Senate itself a Senate Suggestion).
But it doesn't look like it will break anything, at the moment.

Two things:
1. Specify that the CotC is to report the awarding of the title
2. If you're going to amend Rule 1789 anyway, change "those who ey feel"
   into "those who e feels" as well

That is precisely what Chuck's Second Savings and Loan Contest

No, my point (and Scott's and Vlad's, I believe) is that it was
*not* impossible for Kolja to prevent Steve from embezzling his

Please re-read what I wrote. I am talking about what was the case at that
moment, not before or after. I am talking about what he could do at that
moment, not about what he could do later.

But it does matter here whether or not Steve *did* embezzle. The
question I believe needs to be answered is: When the Proposals
were distributed, was there a legal series of actions by which
Kolja could *guarantee* that 3 VTs were available to em? At
that instant, the only things that matter are the *actual* state
of the game and Kolja's *potential* legal actions (sorry for using so
*many* asterisks). Steve's potential actions are irrelevant. Steve's
actual actions are relevant insofar as they affected the actual
game state at that moment. And the answer to the question is yes.

And it is this point with which I strongly disagree.  Kolja can only
prevent this if e revokes PoA *before* Steve embezzles.  This is
only truly possible (not just theoretically possible)  if Kolja has perfect
knowledge of Steve's future actions.  And we can be reasonably
certain that Kolja does not have such perfect knowledge.

I was using the word "impossible" in the same sense that it is impossible
for me to fly to the moon without a spaceship, even though it is
still theoretically possible for me to fly to the moon.

I wrote in comment of the recent discussions:

I have a basic idea for this, but its drawback is, as usual, more
recordkeeping.

My idea is to base responsibilities such as Duty to Vote or Taxation on
how much Currency a Player owns, possibly minus eir private debts.

The Currency holdings of an Organization should be divided into Shares
belonging to each Player within its Jurisdiction.  A Player is then deemed
to own the Currency e holds privately, plus any Shares assigned to em.

The Executor of an Organization would be responsible for reporting to the
Currency Recordkeepor how the Organization's holdings of that Currency are
divided into Shares.  By default, we might either let Currency belong to
the Executor, or to the Player who owned it before it was transfered
to the Organization.

In this way, every amount of Currency in the game would belong to some
Player, except that in the Bank.  Given the basic system, it would of
course be relatively easy to grant some Organizations Tax Exemption,
whereby their Holdings belongs to now Player.

So, what do you think?

Greetings,
Ørjan.

Sorry, Chuck, I found the ordinances. To be brief, I think
you do have effective control of the assets held by the contest.

Not at all.  Kolja can prevent it by revoking the Power of Attorney.

There is diminishment insofar as control is shared.  Suppose you own a
business.  Suppose further that you take on a business partner.  Under
the law, your partner has power equal to and severable from your own
to, inter alia, convey any or all of the property of the business to a
third party, a power you held solely to yourself prior to taking on
the partner.  Is your control over the business diminished?  Do you
retain effective control over the business?

This is the argument that I, Vlad, and Chuck are all making.

I don't think this is particularly counterintuitive.

I think Vlad and I have come to close to the same conclusion.  The
only difference that remains seems to be my argument that Kolja's
control over those 3 VTs was lessened by eir giving PoA to
Steve because Steve could have disposed of them without
Kolja's knowledge or consent.  However, I have convinced myself,
with the help of everyone's thoughtful arguments, that because
Steve did *not* embezzle enough votes prior to the proposal batch
distribution and because Kolja could have accessed those VTs at
any time, Kolja did still have "effective" control of them.

Again, I said it was impossible *without foreknowledge*, since Kolja can
only prevent it by revoking PoA before Steve embezzles (see my
response to the same argument from Chuck).

This was my point.  Shared control is a lesser form of control than
exclusive control.  But I agree that it is still effective control.

And, as I've said, I've been convinced.  8)

My mistake. I misread ordinance 7. I agree that the contest
funds are out of your effective control. On the other hand,
the utility of the contest is reduced insofar as the funds
are out of your control. If there are sudden expenses, you
may be in trouble. But as long as you are content to budget
ahead, it should be fine.
