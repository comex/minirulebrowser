Protoproposal Chaos18 [rev. 2]

Probate, Take Two

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1601 be amended to read:

      The Notary shall place in Probate any entity which possesses
      Units of Currency or which is named as the Payee or Payor of any
      Payment Order, which does not have an Executor, and which is not
      already in Probate, as soon as possible after being made aware
      of this condition.

      No entity may be destroyed while it possesses Units of Currency
      or while it is named as the Payee or Payor of any Payment
      Orders; any attempt to destroy an entity while it is in this
      condition shall be deferred until this condition no longer
      holds.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would destroy an
      entity while it possesses units of Currency.

      The following definitions apply with respect to entities in
      Probate:

      1. Assets: all units of Currency held by the entity in Probate,
         along with all Payment Orders naming the entity in Probate as
         payee.

      2. Debt: a Payment Orders naming the entity in Probate as payor.
 
      3. Credit: a Payment Order naming the entity in Probate as
         payee.

      4. Creditor: an entity which is the payee of a debt.

      5. Debtor: an entity which is the payor of a credit.

      6. Heir: an entity named in the Will (if any) of the entity in
         Probate.

      7. Estate: the assets and debts of the entity in Probate.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1745 be repealed.

[An entity possessing stranded Currencies is placed in Probate
 instead.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1738 be amended to read:

      Whenever there is an entity in Probate which does not have an
      Trustee, the Notary shall nominate a Player to be that entity's
      Trustee.  E shall announce this appointment in the Public Forum.

      As soon as possible after the Notary announces the appointment
      of a Trustee for an entity in Probate, each Recordkeepor, with
      respect to the Currency of which e is the Recordkeepor, shall
      provide to that Trustee an accounting of the number of units of
      that Currency held by the entity in Probate, and a list of all
      Payment Orders naming the entity in Probate as either Payor or
      Payee.

      As soon as possible after the Trustee has received all of the
      reports required by the previous paragraph, e shall formulate
      and announce in the Public Forum a Plan for the disposition of
      the estate of the entity in Probate according to the provisions
      of the Probate Code.  However, if the Trustee determines, during
      the course of constructing the Plan, that any of the credits or
      debts of the entity in Probate is disputed, e shall announce
      this fact in the Public Forum, and shall neither formulate nor
      announce a Plan until after the dispute has been settled, and
      shall do so as soon as possible after the dispute has been
      settled.

      If no legally-made objection to the Plan is posted in the Public
      Forum during a waiting period of seven days following its
      announcement, the Trustee shall, as soon as possible after the
      expiration of thia waiting period, perform whatever steps are
      necessary to implement the Plan for disposition.  If there is a
      legally-made objection, the Trustee shall, as soon as possible
      after the objection is announced, formulate and announce a new
      Plan as above, repeating the process until there is no
      objection.

      However, if a CFJ is made alleging that an objection to a
      Trustee's Plan lacks foundation, then the Trustee shall neither
      formulate a new Plan nor implement the existing Plan until the
      CFJ is resolved.  If a CFJ finds that an objection lacks
      foundation, then the Trustee may proceed as if that objection
      had never been made, and any attempt to announce that same
      objection again is not legally made.

      An objection to a Plan for disposition has foundation if it
      properly alleges that:
        a) the Plan constructed is not in accord with the provisions
           of the Probate Code;
        b) the Plan disregards the Will (if any) of the entity in
           Probate;
        c) the implementation of the Plan as constructed would be
           substantially unfair to a creditor or heir of the entity in
           Probate; or
        d) the Plan would not fully dispose of the estate of the
           entity in Probate.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      The Trustee of an entity in Probate is empowered to submit on
      behalf of that entity whatever Transfer Orders are necessary to
      implement eir Plan for the disposition of that entity's Estate,
      as if e were that entity's Executor.  The Trustee may also
      execute and vacate Payment Orders when necessary to implement
      the Plan for the disposition of the Estate.

      The Trustee may exercise the above powers only when implementing
      a Plan for the disposition of the Estate of the entity in
      Probate of which e is the Trustee.

      The Trustee of an entity in Probate ceases to be Trustee when:
        a) e announces in the Public Forum that e resigns as Trustee;
        b) e ceases to be a Player;
        c) the entity of which e is Trustee ceases to be in Probate;
           or 
        d) the Notary announces that e has been removed as Trustee.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1739 be amended to read:

      The Plan for the disposition of the estate of an entity in
      Probate shall be constructed by its Trustee as detailed below.

      First, the Plan shall divide the assets of the estate amongst
      its creditors, assigning to each creditor assets equal to the
      amount due that creditor if possible, or a pro-rata portion if
      not.  All debts, whether satisfied in full or not, shall be
      cancelled.

      Next, if the entity in Probate is terminal, the Plan shall apply
      the Will, if any, of the entity in Probate to the extent
      possible.  Any assets remaining after the application of the
      Will shall be divided amongst the heirs named in the Will,
      assigning to each heir a portion computed in a manner consistent
      with the Will; if the Will is silent or unclear on the division
      of remaining assets, the division shall be equal.

      Next, if the entity in Probate is terminal, and there is no Will
      or the Will fails to fully dispose of all assets of the entity
      in Probate, the Plan shall then cancel all remaining credits and
      assign all remaining units of Currency to the Bank.

      Units of Currency are assigned to an entity by requiring a
      Transfer Order for those Units of Currency from the entity in
      Probate to that Entity.  

      A credit is assigned to an entity by requiring a Payment Order
      from the payor of the credit to the entity to whom it has been
      assigned; however, if the payor of the credit is the same as the
      entity to whom it is to be assigned, no Payment Order shall be
      required.

      A debt is cancelled by requiring the vacation of the Payment
      Order which established it.

Protoproposal Chaos12 [rev. 1]

Simplify Judicial Salaries

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 502 be amended to read:

      The Clerk of the Courts shall, within one week of the time a
      Player earns a Judicial Salary, pay out that Judicial Salary to
      that Player.

      If a decision (or dismissal) which resulted in a Player earning
      a Judicial Salary is subsequently appealed and overturned on
      appeal, the Clerk of the Court shall vacate the Payment Order
      paying the salary originally received for that decision.

[Simplifies matters considerably.  The "within one week" is used
 instead of ASAP to allow the CotC to batch salary payments together
 instead of having to do them in strict ASAP order.]

Protoproposal Chaos3 [rev. 1]

Persistent Judges

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 951 be amended to read:

      Whenever there is an open Call for Judgement to which no Player
      has been assigned as its Judge, the Clerk of the Court shall, as
      soon as possible after being made aware of this condition,
      randomly select a Player to be assigned as its Judge.  This
      selection shall be made from amongst all those Players eligible
      to serve as the Judge of that CFJ.  

      Once assigned as the Judge of a CFJ, that Player remains the
      Judge of that CFJ until e is recused from that CFJ, or e ceases
      to be a Player.

      The Clerk shall announce the identity of the Player who is
      assigned to Judge a CFJ as soon as possible after the selection
      is made.

      A CFJ is "open" if it has neither been dismissed nor judged, or
      if there is an outstanding judicial motion pertaining to that
      CFJ which has been neither granted nor denied.  A CFJ which is
      not open is closed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 408 be amended to read:

      The Judge of an open CFJ is required to, within seven days of
      when that CFJ last became open or seven days of eir assignment
      to that CFJ, whichever is later, close that CFJ by dismissing or
      judging the CFJ and/or granting or denying any outstanding
      judicial motions pertaining to that CFJ.  Other Rules may
      prescribe a different time limit or establish procedures by
      which this time limit may be extended or shortened, and this
      Rule defers to them.

      The failure of a Judge to close a case within the prescribed
      time constitutes the Infraction of Judicial Tardiness and
      carries a penalty of one Blot for each day (or fraction thereof)
      that the case remains open beyond the permitted time.  This
      penalty is to be reported by the Clerk of the Courts.

      The failure to observe this time limit does not, by itself,
      cause the delinquent Judge to be recused from the CFJ, nor does
      it invalidate eir judgment or dismissal of the CFJ or grant or
      denial of any related judicial motion which that Judge might
      submit after the limit has expired.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 591 be amended to read:

      A Judge judges a CFJ by sending eir Judgment to the Clerk of the
      Courts.  The Judgement of a CFJ must be either TRUE or FALSE.
      Only the Judge assigned to a CFJ may Judge that CFJ.

      As soon as possible after the receipt of a legal Judgement, the
      Clerk shall distribute the Judgement to the Public Forum.

      A Judge shall receive a Judicial Salary of 1 VT for judging a
      CFJ.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1567 be amended to read:

      A Player makes emself ineligible to be the Judge of a specific
      CFJ by transmitting a notice to the Clerk of the Courts,
      specifying the CFJ for which e wishes to be made ineligible.

      If, at the time a Player makes emself ineligible to be a Judge
      of a CFJ in this manner had already been selected as the Judge
      of that CFJ, the Clerk of the Courts shall bill that Player a
      fee of 0.5 VT and shall recuse that Player as the Judge of that
      CFJ.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      The Clerk of the Courts shall recuse from a CFJ any Judge who is
      delinquent upon the demand of any two Players.  A Player demands
      the recusal of a delinquent Judge by posting eir demand in the
      Public Forum.

      A Judge recused for delinquency commits the Infraction of
      Judicial Delinquency, which bears a penalty of 2 Blots to be
      reported by the Clerk of the Courts.

If e was a Player, I do not think e can unbecome a Player unless
the rules explicitly (now) deny him Playerhood.  If e was never registered
(which isn't the case IMHO, but we'll assume so) then I don't think e can
ever stop being a Player since the only way the rules take away playerhood
is by deregistering people.

You're equivocating.

Eek. I certainly received enough Infractions of Failure to Report for
failing to produce a non-existant report...

Indeed, I think this would tend to support the argument that Morendil
*was* registered -- i.e., he became Speaker, and then, since "Players"
is defined to include "the Speaker," became a Player and thus was
registered.

Game custom, since I've been here, at least, argues for "FOR each week,"
which I've done, and seen done by other Mad Scientists, several times.

Right. The CFJ judging the two to be the same was judged during that
one-month period, I believe, when Scott was registered *as* Scott.
Kelly's registrations were much earlier, I believe.

As do I. As several players are so fond of pointing out, it is a great
fallacy to assume that because something works in a certain way in RL,
it works that way in Agora as well. At the moment, I don't see "ownership"
of currencies as being akin to real physical ownership; it's more like 
numbers in bank accounts than anything else.

I take this opportunity to note that Morendil's outburst is obviously
a case of contaminated bodily fluids and that, should I become CinC
once again, I shall vow to keep fluoridated water from Agora 
forevermore. :)

Ah, you're right - the messages I thought were dated Oct 96 were, in

I think the idea is: he never was registered. He was a non-registered
Player, courtesy of R103's prescription that the Speaker is a Player.
Now that he's no longer the Speaker, he'd revert to being a non-registered
non-Player. (Of course, he's reregistered since then.)

This anticipates a Judgement on FALSE in CFJ 1070.

Crito has made some good points, and I'm reconsidering my position.
Nevertheless, it's not obvious to me that the numbers in bank accounts
view makes any more tenable the view that Plato is capable of having a
bank account.

I never claimed the two were logically equivalent. 'is' is not 'if
and only if'. Nevertheless, how does the argument offered differ from
this argument, which seems plain enough: "An Officer is a Player; a
Player is person registered as a Player; therefore, an Officer is
a person registered as a Player."? There are no claims of logical
equivalence being made here, note.

It seems to me that you read R103 and R869 as being in conflict with
each other on the question of whether Morendil is a registered
Player, with R103 taking precedence and making him a non-registered
Player.  But you have yet to justify your claim (as I see it) that
there is a conflict. Nor have you shown what is wrong with the
argument.  Merely calling it contorted does not make it so. To me it
seem quite straightforward. R103 does that the term 'Player' in the
Rules in specifically includes the Speaker. How can you avoid the
conclusion that the term 'Player' in Rule 869 specifically includes
the Speaker, which gives us a flat declaration that the Speaker is
a person registered as a Player? I see no higher precedence Rule
contradicting this flat declaration.

Thanks for posting these, Morendil. I have some comments.

I think this is a fine principle on which which to let a Judgement of
FALSE rest. As Judge Crito noted, the Rules are silent on the meaning
of 'entity'. This principle provides a useful clarification: 'entity'
is wider than things mentioned explicitly in the Rules, since it can
include Bill Gates, but not so wide as to include what you call
'arbitrary legal fictions'. The discovery of such principles is in my
view one of the most important functions of the Judiciary.

It could be objected, perhaps with some justification, that what you
have discovered is simply a different principle than the one applied
by Judge Crito, the difference being merely one of taste, and that
previous remarks of mine have been to the effect that where a Justice
disagrees with a Judge on a matter of taste, the Judge's decision
should be allowed to stand. This argument deserves consideration, but
I am inclined ultimately to reject it on the grounds that what separates
your (proto-)Judgement from Crito's goes beyond mere matters of taste.
In elucidating the principle above, you have given a substance to
the term 'entity' which Crito's Judgement does not provide, since he
appears to take the silence of the Rules on the meaning of 'entity'
as consent to interpret it as placing few if any restrictions on
what can be a destination entity for the purposes of R1598. 

Having written the above, I confess that I have not entirely
convinced myself that what separates your Judgement from Crito's
really does go beyond matters of taste; it seems just as likely that
I simply prefer your taste, and your principle, to that of Crito. I
believe that the game would be better served by adopting your
principle rather than Crito's, but again, it's not clear to me that
such an appeal to the best interests of the game justifies
overturning Crito's Judgement. I commend the matter to your best
conscience.

I think my remarks above provide a better (although by no means 
conclusive) argument for allowing Crito's Judgement to stand than
these remarks do. The silence of the Rules concerning the meaning
of 'entity' provide you with great latitude in interpreting R1598.
Had your proto-Judgement been submitted as the original Judgement
of CFJ 1062, I would be applauding it and recommending its acceptance
without the reservations expressed above, which are entirely concerned
with the role of the Board of Appeals. R1011 is irrelevant in my view.

I think the time has come to consider various mechanisms by which
a Judge or Justice might be able to gain an extension of the time
available to em for Judging. As a framework for discussion, I
propose that such extentsions be limited to one week, to be granted
at most once. Thw question I want to focus on is: how should such
extensions be granted?

My first thought was to use the Without Objection mechanism. But
this has its problems. To perform any action Without Objection
you must give 4 days warning. This means that unless you know
you're going to need an extension in the first three days after
your selection as Judge or Justice, the WO mechanism cannot help.
Since I think there are cases where a Judge or Justice might not
discover until quite late in the day that they need an extension
(eg delays in getting statements from concerned parties), we have
to look elsewhere.

My current idea is that a Judge or Justice might seek an extension
by submitting an Application for an Extension to the CotC. There
are a number of details to be filled in. In particular, three
questions present themselves:

1. Should the CotC be given the power to refuse such Applications?
Not giving em this power invites lazy Judges and Justices to seek
extensions where they are not necessary. Giving them this power
might significantly politicize the Office. Perhaps, though, that's
not a bad thing. I tend to favour giving the CotC the power to
refuse Applications.

2. Should the Applicant be formally required to 'show cause' why they
should be granted an extension (ie, should the Applicant be required
to include such reasons in the Application?) Or should such arguments
be kept informal?

3. Should the Applicant be required to seek other Signatures than
eir own for the Application? If so, how many, and whose?

I agree. I was thinking the same thing after Swann's recent late 
judgement. I would be happy to let such extensions be made purely
at the discretion of the CotC.

     But why "fortunately"? I think that it would be very amusing to use
     a really obscure language. 8)

   Yes, you're right, but I am content to choose French, because I know 
   most Players read it, and also because ["+riglais;" - the asciification
   of this word means I don't recognise it] English words come (for the 
   most part) from French. So, I would hope that people can read it, even
   when that they do not know any French.

Okay, would all relevant Officers send me the info about outstanding
Payment Orders naming Elde as either payor or payee.

Also, the same people send me the same information with regard to myself.

I agree.  And as far as more power, giving Officers more power
is something we've wanted to do for awhile.  Let's give R1665 (Abuse
of Responsibility) a chance to actually be used!

I would keep them informal.  The COTC should be encouraged
(by the populace, not by any Rule) to refuse extensions where
no cause is given.

>3. Should the Applicant be required to seek other Signatures than
>eir own for the Application? If so, how many, and whose?

Nope, that would just make it take longer.
