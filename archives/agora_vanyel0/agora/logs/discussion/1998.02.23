My fault, 3688 should of course be annotated with an asterisk.

But when someone gets around 10 Indulgences in the hole, they'll 
probably get pretty desperate. Particularly if the players who have 
Indulgences demand high prices (in VTs) for them. [Now, why would 
that happen?]

Yeah, about 1 out of 3 buildings or more needs to be a Mine, or 
things start collapsing. More than that is needed when people want to 
build a different structure. So out of 10 players, perhaps 4 would be 
Miners, 5 Farmers, and 1 Houser [heh].

A player who builds three Churches will get nearly half of the 
Indulgences distributed. Then, whenever anyone gets Blots, about half 
of the Indulgences will go to that player. The player with the Blots 
will then be stuck with PI until he pays the Indulgence-holder's 
price. Seems like a nifty racket to me, unless Agorans stop breaking 
Rules.

The design is no longer mine. At the time, it seemed that some system 
involving extra Plots for officers could be worked out, not to 
mention that was around the start of "Capitalism, Ho!" (IIRC).

The original purpose of Plots was to create the economic imbalace of 
Jobs, but in a more interesting way.

Be warned, making a version of Plots such that the other stuff can be 
added later without restarting will be a severe headache.

Probably a good idea. [Heck, I wrote those early versions. I _know_ 
they're a mess.]

Eeek! Too much paperwork! And anyone who doesn't pay will not only lose
their production, but they'll be hit with a Blot penalty too.

> Proto-Proposal:  Plots (v3.3)

Actually, this style of version numbering is quite outmoded - 
especially with products that have this kind of revision cycle.
I suggest that you call the next proto "Plots' 98". Next year
you can trot out "Plots '99", unless you prefer to wait, as I'm
sure they will all be doing, for the Millenium Edition.

This is all that came up when I tried to reply.  Not even my usual special
trick for including text attachments worked.  Reading is a pain too, I
have to use the View Attachment menu.

Anyhow, I saw someone quoting part of the church production system, and I
must protest.  Indulgences are self-balancing, and I will not support the
destruction of that property.

Greetings,

I would recommend that a nomic is given a period of grace in which it is
to find itself a new liason. If this period expires, without a new liason
being appointed, then the nomic suffers a loss of status.
<<

You could argue, of course, that this is the situation we have at the
moment. "Having a liaison" is not very strictly defined - if a nomic
"ceases to have a liaison" all we will notice on the IN level will be
silence as far as that nomic is concerned.

I recommend cutting down the supply rates drastically.
<<

I agree.

Regarding salaries, I think it would be a natural extension of the
plots principle (to be proposed later, not in the first version) to
abolish salaries paid by the bank, and instead fill all the office
buildings with some more life: have the officers' buildings prodice
VTs or whatever, to be collected by whoever holds the office. We might
even have a new office for the administration and maintenance of these
public buildings (in control of some mines, and responsible to use
these ergs for maintaining the office buildings).

A while ago (nearly a year) I started working on an Agora FAQ.
I thought I'd repost the outdated version in hopes that someone
might think to contribute to finishing and updating it.

(For instance, none of the Pragmatic Currency items are
 dealt with in this.)

I've done a little updating, but not much yet....

Unwritten sections are marked by (+)

Sections marked by (+) are unwritten but other Players have expressed

All contributions of questions/answers are welcome.  (Even if you don't
have the time or energy to make a major contribution, draft an answer
to one or two of your favorite questions, every little bit helps.)

0.0: INTRODUCTION

 0.1: What's the point of this FAQ?
     This FAQ is intended to be a quick and dirty way for pepole not 
     familiar with the game of Agora to learn enough of the basics to 
     participate in the game.  Ideally, someone new to Agora will be 
     able to read this, register as a Player, and participate with a 
     minimum of confusion.

 0.2: Where can I get this FAQ?
     This FAQ will eventually be made available through monthly posts to 
     alt.games.nomic, and a web site at 
     http://www.sff.net/people/SASwann/nomic/Agorafaq.htm

 0.3: Ok, so what is Agora?
     Agora is one of the most long-lived games of nomic in existence. 
     The Agora Ruleset has been in existence for over three years and 
     has grown from a initial set not much different from Suber's 
     original, to now encompass over 250 Rules and 280K worth of text.

 0.4: Hey, I didn't understand any of that, what is a nomic?
     This FAQ assumes that you are familiar with the concept of nomic, 
     if you aren't, you should look up Malcolm Ryan's Nomic FAQ.  You
     can find it at;

     The nomic ftp site:
     ftp://ftp.cse.unsw.edu.au/pub/users/malcolmr/nomic/FAQ

     Its web site:
     http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~malcolmr/nomic-faq.html

     & Doug Chatham's mirror at:
     http://funnelweb.utcc.utk.edu/~chatham/nomicfaq.html

     As well as periodic postings on;
     alt.games.nomic, alt.answers, alt.fan.hofstadter, & 
     rec.games.abstract.

     We'll wait for you :)  For those who want to read this straight 
     through, nomic, most simply stated, is a game where one of the 
     principal "moves" is to change the rules.  Therefore, the rules of 
     any particular nomic game are changing over time, mostly at the 
     hands of the players.  Agora has been compared to a Parliament, or 
     a Senate.

 0.5: Version notes
     This is the Agora FAQ Version 0.2, based on the Short Logical
     Ruleset dated Sun Jan 25 1998.

============================================================
1.0: Getting on board.

 1.1: Where do I find Agora?
     At the moment Agora is Played through five mailing lists. Four 
     comprise what in Agora is known as the "Public Forum," the fifth 
     is a discussion list which by the Rules, and game custom, has no 
     real impact on the game.  In order to play Agora, you must be 
     subscribed to the four lists that comprise the Public Forum.  
     Subscription to the discussion list (traditionally the highest 
     volume list) is optional.

   agora-official@gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au  -- the discussion list:
                                             for unoffical Agora talk.
   agora-business@gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au  -- the public forum:

     REMEMBER: the backup lists are part of the Public Forum, and
     Players are required to subscribe to them.

 1.2: What are all these lists for?
     agora-discussion is a pure discussion list. It is a forum for the 
     Players to talk to each other.  Anything non-essential (i.e.
     anything the Rules don't require to be produced and/or read by any
     Players.) goes here.  Ideally, any player can participate in Agora
     without paying attention to the discussion list, though watching
     the debates that erupt on it is one of the better ways to learn
     some of the fine points of the rules-- and is also one of the fun
     parts of the game.  REMEMBER: Officers will generally not pay
     attention to official business placed on the discussion list.

     agora-official is the part of the Public Forum that is generally 
     reserved for Officers' Reports.  Normally a Player who is not an 
     Officer will not have need to post anything to this list.  However, 
     Players should generally pay attention to what is posted in agora-
     official, because these reports are descriptions of the Game State, 
     which includes everything from lists of who is an Officer, to the 
     Ruleset itself.

     agora-business is the part of the Public Forum used for all other 
     communications that Rules require, or other communications that are
     related to the "business" of Agora;  things such as public
     communications to Officers, announciments that a Player is going On
     Hold or deregistering (see section 2), the creation of Contests
     (see section 7), and, in general, anything that should be posted to
     the Public Forum that isn't an official report. If a Player needs
     to send a message to an Officer, it is almost always acceptable to
     send that message to agora-business-- the Officer will receive it, 
     even if the Player is unsure exactly who the Officer is.

     The two backup lists usually lie dormant unless some problem 
     erupts with the main lists.  They are also part of the Public 
     Forum, and can be used in the same way as agore-business & 
     official, but only if necessary.

  1.2.1: Are there any other restrictions on what can go in the Public
         Forum?
        There are few legal restrictions on what goes on the lists, but
        you should be aware that anything you send to the Public Forum
        should be correct, to the best of your knowledge, or else
        contain a disclaimer that it is not/might not be correct.
        Deliberate lies may not be posted to the Public Forum.  (Lying
        on agora-discussion, while strongly discouraged, is allowed.)
        [cf. 1497]

 1.3: What do I need before I Play?
     The two indispensable documents for the beginning Agoran are the 
     Registrar's Report, and the Logical Ruleset.  You can wait for them
     to be posted to the Public Forum, which they are, weekly. Or you
     can post a request for them in the Public Forum, and the Officers
     in charge will e-mail them to you.  In addition, you can find the
     Logical Ruleset in a number of different forms at:

     http://www.dfw.net/~ccarroll/agora/rules/

1.4:  What is the Logical Ruleset?  How do I find specific Rules?
      What's the difference between the Short and Long Rulesets?
     The Logical Ruleset is the preferred format for dealing with the 
     large collection of Rules that govern play in Agora.  The Rules are 
     in the Logical Ruleset are organized to facilitate finding the
     rules covering specific areas.  Every Rule is placed in a
     particular category with other Rules relating to the same area.
     So, if you are interested in finding a specific Rule related to
     Voting, you'd spend time looking in the categories "Voting on
     Proposals," "The End of the Voting Period," and "Referenda and
     Elections," without worrying about Rules in categories like
     "Patent Titles," and "Silliness."  (Of course there's inevitable
     overlap in categories, and since the Rules change over time,
     sometimes a Rule ends up in an inappropriate Category-- but the
     broad principle still holds.)

     The Long Logical Ruleset contains a lot of other information
     in addition to the Rules and their Numbers, such as Rule titles,
     amendment numbers & histories, and annotations (mandatory ones
     ordered by the courts, and unofficial ones provided by the
     Rulekeepor) that help in interpreting the rules. The Short Logical
     Ruleset is the Ruleset that is limited to the Number, amendment 
     number, text, title and categories of the Rules.
     [cf. 1681]

     The Long Logical Ruleset is published every month, the Short one
     every week.
     [cf. 1051]

     In most Agora correspondence, a Rule is referred to by a Rule 
     Number alone, without an amendment number.  This is taken to refer 
     to the current version of the Rule.  In this FAQ, most sub-sections
     will contain refrences to Rule numbers ( such as [cf. 1051] ) which
     refer to the Rules that most apply to the section containing them.

     Hint: A simple way to find a rule, given its number, is to load the 
     Logical Ruleset into any text editor and search for the text string 
     "NNNN/" (no trailing spaces) where NNNN is the number of the Rule.
     It will take you straight to the heading of the Rule.

 1.5: Why do I need the Registrar's Report?
     The Registrar's Report includes a sction known as the Nomic Phone
     Books, which are important for two reasons.  First, they 
     will give you a list of all the current players, and their contact 
     addresses.  Second, they will tell you which Players serve in which 
     Offices, which is indispensable information when you're first 
     trying to feel your way around the game.
     [cf. 1502]

 1.6: How do I join the game?
     Joining the game is called "registering." All you have to do is
     post a message to the Public Forum (not the discussion list) saying
     that you want to join, and give (optionally) your fellow Agorans a
     nickname to call you. [cf. 869, 1432]

============================================================
2.0: Being a Player in Agora.

 2.1: What's "On Hold" Mean?
     When you know that you will be away from your internet access for
     more than a couple days, you may place yourself "On Hold".  Doing
     so lets everyone know that you'll be quiet for a while, and
     prevents game-related obligations from cropping up while you're
     away. [cf. 1016]

   2.1.1: How do I go On Hold?
         Simply post a message to the Public Forum (nomic-business,
         preferably) saying that you go On Hold. [cf. 1016]

         Currently, being on hold means that you move to the Stasis
         Chamber.  Current game custom seems to be that simply saying
         you go On Hold implies such a move. (see section 7.5)

   2.1.2: What happens when I am On Hold?
         Being On Hold means that you can't Vote or make Proposals, but
         also absolves you of any game-related duty that might crop up.
         In addition, it precludes being an Officer or being the Speaker
         (see section 5.) [cf. 1584]

   2.1.3: How do I come off Hold?
         Simply post a message to the Public Forum (nomic-business,
         preferably) saying that you go Off Hold.  You have to have
         been On Hold for at least 4 days. [cf. 1016]

         Currently, this implies a move from the Stasis Chamber.

   2.1.4: What's an Active Player?
         "Active" is synonymous with "Off Hold", and is usually a lot
         less awkward to say.

 2.2: How can I deregister?
     Simply post a message to the Public Forum saying that you
     deregister.  Deregistration means you are no longer a Player,
     although you can rejoin at a later date (at least a month later).
     [cf. 1043]

 2.3: Can I be deregistered for any other reasons?
     Yes.  If you aren't On Hold (see 2.1) and don't post anything at
     all for a period of two weeks, you may be deregistered.  If you are
     On Hold for longer than sixty days, you may also be deregistered.
     [cf. 1042]

============================================================
3.0: Democracy in Agora.

 3.1: How do I Vote?
     Whenever something is voted upon in Agora, there is a specific 
     Player the Rules designate to collect those votes.  A Player votes 
     by sending a message indicating what e is voting upon, and how e is 
     voting, to that Player.  While vote collectors keep the votes of
     Players (and other entities who may vote) secret, the Players
     themselves are permitted to post their votes in the Public 
     Forum.  [cf. 452, 1625]

     An announcement that there is something to vote upon is always made 
     in the Public Forum.  After this announcement there is a limited 
     time for Players to submit their votes to the appropriate vote 
     collector.  This time is called the voting period, and votes 
     submitted outside this period are not counted.

   +3.1.2: Voting Token, what's that?

   +3.1.3: This is a democracy, but Voting isn't free?

   +3.1.4: Then what's Presence?  Isn't that a Vote?

   +3.1.5: How do I get a Voting Token then?

   +3.1.6: I can't vote on anything without a Voting Token?

 3.2: What is there to Vote on?
     Players vote on Proposals, Elections, and Referenda.
     [cf. 693, 1434, 1445]

   3.2.1: What characterizes a Proposal?
         The Assessor collects Votes for Proposals.  To vote
         on a Proposal, a Player sends a message to the Assessor
         indicating a specific Proposal, and a vote of either For,
         Against, or Abstain for that Proposal.  This vote can be
         changed if the Player sends a corrected vote to the Assessor
         within the voting period.  The voting period for Proposals is
         ten days. [cf. 683, 693]

         REMEMBER: The Assessor collects votes on Proposals, but the
         Promotor collects Proposal submissions, and distributes the
         Proposals. (see section 3.3, 5.4)

   3.2.2: What characterizes an Election?
         The Registrar announces Elections for all Offices (except for
         the Office of Registrar itself; those Elections are announced
         by the Speaker).  Whoever legally announces an Election is the
         vote collector for that Election, even if someone else becomes
         Registrar (or Speaker) before the voting period ends. To vote
         in an Election a Player sends a message to the vote collector
         indicating the Election being voted in, and the nominee for
         whom the Player is voting.  This vote cannot be changed once
         made.  The voting period for Elections is one week.
         [cf. 1445, 1558, 790]

   3.2.3: What characterizes a Referendum?
         Referenda of various sorts may be called for by the Rules.  In 
         general they are announced by that Referenda's vote collector, 
         require a non-retractable vote of For, Against, or Abstain, and
         have a voting period of one week.  Things that call for
         Referenda are the Impeachment of Officers, the Tainting of
         Speakers, and things related to Internomic.
         [cf. 1434, 1486, 1658, 1632]

 3.3: How do I make a Proposal?
     All you need to do is label a piece of text as a Proposal and send 
     it to the Promotor, either directly or through the Public Forum.
     [cf. 1483, 404, 1605, 1036]

   3.3.1: What's Disowning a Proposal and why/how would I do it?
         Disowning a Proposal prevents the Proposer from getting
         penalized for that Proposal.  Usually it's done when the
         Proposer realizes (after submitting it) that eir Proposal is
         flawed.

         A Player may disown eir own Proposal either before its
         distribution or early in its voting period, by posting to
         the Public Forum that e does so.  Disowning carries a 5 Mil
         cost. [cf. 1451]

   3.3.2: What's a Disintrested Proposal and why/how would I make one?
         Disinterested Proposals are related to Disowned Proposals, but
         their purpose is completely different.  Disinterested Proposals
         came about because it was silly that the uncontroversial,
         minor-fix Proposals were receiving bigger rewards than the
         really good major-revision Proposals.  Some Players were voting
         against Proposals they liked just to decrease the author's
         reward.  By making a Proposal Disinterested, the author states
         that e wishes no reward for the Proposal, to prevent that.

         Proposals are made Disinterested by designating them as such
         when they are submitted.  [cf. 1623]
  
     +3.3.2.1: P-Notes? Petition fees? What are they?
   
     +3.3.2.2: You mean Proposing things isn't free either?

   3.3.3: What's a Proto-Proposal?
          It is customary to submit preliminary drafts of all but the
          most minor of Proposals to the Public Forum for review and
          comment by the other Players. Such submissions are labeled
          Proto-Proposals (PROTO for short) to distinguish them from
          actual Proposals being submitted for vote.  The Proto custom
          is completely informal at the moment, and while optional, it
          is highly recommended to Proto any Proposal of more than a few
          lines. 

   3.3.4: No one commented on my Proto-Proposal.  Is that good or bad?
         Well, as you might expect, that's hard to say.  If you
         don't get any comments on your Proto-Proposal, it might mean
         any number of things.  It could be that no one found any
         problems with your Proto.  Or it could mean that everyone is
         very busy, and didn't really look at it.  If your Proto
         is fairly short and makes no radical changes, that probably
         means it's OK.  But if it's a longer proposal or makes some
         radical changes, you should definitely get comments on it
         before proposing it.  You might try posting it again saying,
         "Hey, no one commented on this the first time around," or you
         might want to send it privately to a few Players to ask for
         comments.

   3.3.5: No fair!  My Proposal failed because another Player pointed
          out a flaw after it was Proposed!  Why didn't e bring that up
          when it was a Proto-Proposal?
         This is a debate that comes up every once in a while, even
         among the more experienced Players.  There are a few who feel
         that it's unfair to criticiize a Proposal if you didn't do
         so when it was a Proto.  However, this view is not held by
         most Players.  As much as we all might like to devote 8 or
         more hours per day to Agora, that is not possible.  And so,
         Players don't always look over Protos very carefully.  Most
         Players do, however, examine Proposals carefully before voting
         on them.  Unfortunately, there's not a whole lot that can
         be done about this.  When the flaw is first pointed out,
         you do have a few options, though.  If it's still less
         then four days since the Promotor sent out your Proposal,
         you can disown the Proposal, so you won't be penalized
         for it.  Another option is to convince the Players that
         although your Proposal is flawed, the flaw is not fatal,
         and they should go ahead and pass the Proposal, and that
         you will then propose a fix for the flaw.

 3.4: What can be in a Proposal?
     Strictly speaking, anything can be contained in a Proposal.  
     However, when a Proposal is adopted, the only parts of it that have 
     effect are legally defined Rule Changes and Directives contained 
     within it. [cf. 404, 594, 993, 1606]

   3.4.1: What's a legal Rule Change? 
         Legal Rule Changes are one of the following; the Creation of a
         new Rule; the Amendment of an existing Rule; the Repeal of an
         existing Rule; and the modification of an existing Rule's
         Mutability Index, known as Mutation. [cf. 105, 1339]
 
   3.4.2: What's a legal Directive?
         There are a number of permissible Directives, they include; a
         Vote of Confidence, which adjusts the Game State to conform to
         a given official report; there can be Directives to change the
         Title and Categories of Rules; there can be Directives to
         create new Rule Categories, and new names for Categories; there
         can be Directives to award Patent Titles to Players; and there
         can be Directives to manipulate the amount of currency, and its
         distribution in the game.

         REMEMBER: that the only Directives that can have effect in a 
         Proposal are Directives that are defined in the Rules.  There's
         no such thing as an undefined Directive.
         [cf. 1550, 1551, 1552, 1054, 1052, 1524, 1485, 649, 1466]

 3.5: What's an Index?

     Indices are one of the potentially confusing aspects of the game.  
     However, they provide little difficulty as long as they aren't 
     confused with each other. [cf. 1274]

   3.5.1: What are Adoption & Voting Indicies?
         Only Proposals have Adoption and Voting Indices.  These Indices
         are properties of the Proposal as a whole.  The Voting Index of
         a Proposal is (generally) the ratio of Votes in favor to those 
         opposed. The Adoption Index of a Proposal is a measure of
         how much support a Proposal needs to pass.  If a Proposal's
         Voting Index exceeds its Adoption Index, it passes.
         [cf. 594, 955]

   3.5.2: What are Power & Mutability Indices?
         Only Rule Changes have a Power Index, and only Rules have a
         Mutability Index. If two or more Rules are in conflict the
         Rule(s) with higher Mutability Index wins the conflict.  Since
         those Rules are more powerful, they're also harder to amend;
         A Rule Change only succeeds if its Power Index is at least as
         high as the Mutability Index of the Rule it tries to amend
         create or delete.

         The Power Index of a Proposed Rule Change is equal to the
         Adoption Index of the Proposal that contained it.  If a Rule
         Change is caused by another Rule, its Power Index is the same
         as the Mutibility index of the Rule that caused it.
         [cf. 1322, 1021, 1482]

   3.5.3: Can you give an example of how all these Indices work?
         Let's say you Proposed an amendment to an existing Rule with a
         Mutability Index of 2.  To have any effect, that Rule Change
         has to have a Power Index of 2. (At least as great as the
         Mutability Index of the Rule it is trying to amend)  Because of
         this, the Proposal containing your amendment would have to have
         an Adoption Index of 2 as well, because the Adoption Index of a
         Proposal has to be the least possible Adoption Index that would
         allow all Rule Changes and Directives within it to have effect.
         This means that in order to pass, your proposal will have to
         achieve a Voting Index of more than 2 (In other words; two For
         votes for every Against vote, plus at least one more vote For.)
         because to pass, a Proposal has to achieve a Voting Index
         greater than its Adoption Index.

 +3.6: What's Quorum?

   +3.6.1: What affects Quorum?

   +3.6.2: My Proposal failed Quorum, what does that mean?

  3.8: What is the Wizard?  Is e an Officer?  What does e do?
      The Wizard gives or takes away Style Points from all the other 
      Players, based on how "stylish" e thinks their Proposals are.

      Style is a concept borrowed from the FRC, in which each Proposal
      author is given a certain (very subjective) number of Style
      Points.  Style Points accumulate until a Wizard Transition, when
      the Player with the most SPs becomes Wizard and all SPs are reset
      to 0.

      The Wizard is not an Officer because the Wizard's salary is paid 
      in Extra Votes, and it used to be required that Officer Salaries 
      be paid in Marks (see section 6); however, that requirement has 
      since been removed.  More importantly, the Wizard is not an Office
      because the Wizard is not an elected position (see section 5)
      [cf. 1542, 1543, 1609, 1610]
============================================================
 4.0: The judicial system of Agora.

   4.1: What's a CFJ?
       CFJ stands for a Call for Judgement (BTW, for reasons lost in the 
       mists of Agora pre-history, that is the correct Agoran spelling) 
       and is the method used for resolution of legal disputes in Agora.  
       A CFJ can be submitted by any Player.  A Player making a CFJ is 
       referred to as the Caller of that CFJ. [cf. 991]

    4.1.1: How do I submit a CFJ?
          You send a message to the Clerk of the Courts, identify it as
          a CFJ, and make sure it includes a clearly identified
          Statement as well as any other information you wish to include
          in the CFJ (see section 4.1.2) [cf. 991]

    4.1.2: What is submitted with a CFJ?
          A CFJ must at the least consist of a mandatory Statement to be 
          judged true or false.  It may include an optional (but 
          recommended) list of reasons and arguments for (or against) 
          the Statement made by the Caller.  The Caller can also include 
          evidence, usually in the form of Rule texts (which is polite, 
          relieving some of research the Judge has to do.) and posts 
          made by the Players.  The Caller can also include a list of up 
          to three Players who are barred from Judging the Statement. 
          [cf. 991, 897, 1563]

          In addition, a CFJ alleging that a Rule is to be interpreted 
          in some way, should include a list of Rules relevant to the 
          given interpretation, including the rule being interpreted.  
          [cf. 1571]

    4.1.3: Am I ever forbidden from making a CFJ?
          Technically no.  However, after you make a CFJ it can be 
          dismissed if you've made more than five CFJs in the prior
          week. This is an Infraction (see section 4.7) for the Caller
          if the Clerk of the Courts catches it.  This doesn't mean 
          anything's wrong with the CFJ, and it can be resubmitted and 
          Judged normally after the week's over. [cf. 1562]

   4.2: What can I make a CFJ about?
       The Statement in a CFJ can cover a lot of technical ground.  The 
       two major things that Statement can cover are allegations that a 
       specific Rule or Rules should be interpreted in a certain fashion 
       and allegations that a player has committed a Crime (see section
       4.7).  However, a Statement can be anything relevant to the Rules 
       that can admit to being true or false.  Often, when Agora is in 
       flux, CFJs are made alleging that the Game State is one of some 
       number of alternatives. [cf. 1563, 1565]

     4.2.1: What can't I make a CFJ about, then?
           The major restriction you need to worry about is that you 
           cannot submit a Statement alleging that some post in the 
           Public Forum is erroneous unless you first make a COE (see 
           section 4.3) about the alleged error, and that error is 
           denied by the Player in charge of the post. (This broadly 
           applies to all official reports, as well as other things.) 
           [cf. 1431]

           Also, bear in mind that Crime (see section 4.3) is a serious 
           business in Agora, and it is very rare that a CFJ is called 
           alleging the commission of one.  This is primarily a cultural 
           phenomenon, but it's one you should be aware of.  A CFJ 
           alleging a Crime is taken as a grave matter, and should be 
           called with some gravity.  Even if a Player commits a Crime, 
           e is often given the benefit of the doubt.

   4.3: What's a COE?
       COE stands for Claim of Error. It is a allegation made in the 
       Public Forum that some other post to the Public Forum is 
       incorrect in some fashion.  The person who produced the allegedly 
       incorrect information has a week to respond to the COE, either 
       admitting the error and correcting it, or denying that the 
       alleged error exists.  This is primarily a mechanism allowing 
       Players to officially point out mistakes in official reports.  It 
       was created to prevent frivolous CFJs on the accuracy of the many 
       reports in Agora; a Player can't CFJ as to the accuracy of such 
       a report until e's COE'd the error first. (see 4.2.1) [cf. 1431]

   4.4: What happens after I make a CFJ?
       The Clerk of the Courts selects a Player at Random to serve as 
       Judge.  The Players come from the pool of active Players who are 
       legible to Judge the CFJ.  (i.e. Players who aren't barred, who 
       aren't the Caller, who aren't otherwise made ineligible by the 
       Rules.) [cf. 951, 698]

     4.4.1: What's the Judge do?
           The Judge determines if the Statement in the CFJ is True or 
           False based first on the Rules, or, if the Rules are unclear 
           on the matter, then based upon game custom, common sense, 
           past Judgements, and the best interests of the game.
           [cf. 591, 217]

           The Judge is bound by a higher standard of proof in the case 
           of alleged Crimes, i.e. True only if beyond a reasonable 
           doubt.  In other case e's only obliged to rule based on the 
           preponderance of the evidence.  [cf. 1575]

           A Judge also can Dismiss improperly-made CFJs and issue 
           Injunctions. [cf. 1565, 663]

     4.4.2: What causes a CFJ to be Dismissed?
           A Judge is required to dismiss CFJs that don't contain 
           identifiable Statements, whose Statements aren't relevant to 
           the Rules, whose Statements can't admit to being True or 
           False, whose Statements aren't in accord with the Rules, or 
           Statements where a reasonable effort cannot determine the 
           truth or falsity of the Statement.  The Clerk of the Courts 
           can also Dismiss excessive CFJs (see section 4.1.3)
           [cf. 1562, 1565]

     4.4.3: What's an Injunction?
           An Injunction is a Judicial order telling certain Players to 
           do something in response to a Judgement.  A Judge can only 
           issue Injunctions that are defined in the Rules. (Like a 
           Directive, there's no such thing as an undefined Injunction.)
           [cf. 663, 1571]

           The primary defined Injunctions are Injunctions to annotate a 
           Rule with a Statement alleging a specific interpretation of 
           that Rule, and Injunctions requiring specific prescribed
           words (up to ten) to appear in a Formal Apology (see section
           4.7.1) in the case of a Player found to have violated a Rule.
           [cf. 789, 908]

   4.5: What if I'm chosen as a Judge?
       Don't panic! :)  You can always make yourself ineligible to Judge 
       a specific CFJ by notifying the Clerk of the Courts that you 
       decline to serve. [cf. 408, 1567]

       If you wish to serve, just remember that your job is to find the 
       given Statement true or false under the Rules. (see section 
       4.4.1)  If you're lost, ask the other Players their opinions 
       before you render yours.  And make sure you're legally justified 
       in a dismissal or an Injunction.  You have a period of one week 
       from your assignment as Judge to send your rulings to the Clerk 
       of the Courts. [cf. 591, 1565, 663]

   4.6: What's an Appeal, what can be Appealed?
       An Appeal is made when a number of Players post in the Public
       Forum that they feel that a CFJ was dealt with incorrectly.  A
       Player can insist on the Appeal of the Judgement delivered by a 
       Judge (believing that the CFJ was Judged in error) on the Appeal 
       of a Injunction (in the belief that it was incorrect or not in 
       accord with the Rules) or on the Appeal of a CFJ's Dismissal,
       (believing that the dismissal wasn't mandated by the Rules.)

       When three Players (or fewer in some special cases) an Appeal is 
       made and a Board of Appeals is formed to decide if the original 
       CFJ was handled correctly.  The Board can issue its own 
       Judgements, set aside prior Judgements, Injunctions and 
       Dismissals, or order that a CFJ be Judged again. The decision of 
       the Board is final. [cf. 911, 1564, 1447]

   4.7: What's the difference between a Crime and an Infraction?
       Some Rules make requirements of Players, and provide to penalize 
       Players if they do not act as they dictate.  Generally, these 
       Rules specify that such a Player has committed a Crime or an 
       Infraction.  The difference is that an Infraction is generally 
       less serious, and its penalty is applied immediately.  Penalties 
       for a Crime are only applied after a CFJ alleging the Crime is 
       Judged true. [cf. 1503, 1504]

       These penalties are usually an award of Blots, or a fine of
       Marks. [cf. 1505]

     4.7.1: When and how do I have to make a Formal Apology?
           Formal Apologies are mandated whenever a CFJ alleging that a 
           Player violated a Rule is Judged true.  This happens even if 
           the violated Rule doesn't specify such a violation to be a 
           Crime or Infraction.

           A Player makes a Formal Apology by positing to the Public 
           Forum an essay of at least 200 words that shows eir 
           contrition, and contains all the prescribed words (if any) 
           given by the Judge who ruled on the CFJ, in the order they 
           were prescribed. (see section 4.4.3) [cf. 908]

   4.8: What's a Blot do?
       Blots prevent a Player from Winning the Game, and every calendar 
       Quarter a player with Blots loses an amount of Mil equal to eir 
       Blots.  [cf. 1435, 1441]

     4.8.1: Help! I'm Blotted, what do I do?
           You don't _have_ to do anything.  However you can remove 
           those Blots by paying five Mil to the Bank for each Blot you 
           wish to erase.  Every calendar quarter Players' Blot totals 
           are halved, though never reduced below one.  [cf. 1440, 1441]

    +4.8.2: How do I get an Indulgence?

============================================================
 5.0: The executive branch of Agora.
   5.1: What's an Office?
      An Office is a position of authority or responsibility.  Each
      Office is held by one Player at all times, and carries a number of
      duties and responsibilities. [cf. 1006]

    5.1.2: What's "held in normal fashion" & "held temporarily" mean?
          All Offices are elected positions in Agora, and anyone who is
          elected to fill an Office holds it in "normal fashion" until
          eir term of service expires. However, an Office is never
          vacant, so Players may serve "temporarily" in an Office until
          an election to fill the Office is resolved.  Whenever an
          Office is held temporarily, an election is held to fill it in
          normal fashion. [cf. 790]

          Offices held normally can be declared to be held temporarily
          (therefore starting an election for the Office) by a Speaker
          calling for Elections, by a Referendum to Impeach an
          Officer, or by a Revolt. [cf. 1486, 1644, 1659]

   5.2: The Speaker isn't an Officer!  Why not? What does e do?
      The Speaker isn't an Officer because most of the default rules for
      Officers simply don't apply.  Prior to the invention of Offices,
      the Speaker had a whole lot of duties; now eir only job is to be
      a "default Officer"--if an Officer disappears or resigns without
      appointing a successor, the Speaker takes over until everything is
      sorted out.  The Speaker is most important in times of crisis,
      such as when several Officers disappear.  [cf. 1006]

      In addition, the Speaker is granted a few extra benefits and
      privileges, such as the Speaker's Vote, Patronage, and Gratuity.
      [cf. 1660, 1661, 1662]

     5.2.1: Who then is the Speaker-Elect, does e do anything?
           The Speaker-Elect is the Officer who is designated to be the
           Speaker's sucessor.  The Specaker-Elect becomes Speaker when
           the Player holding the Speakership ceases to be Speaker.
           [cf. 1647]

     5.2.2: What's a Tainted Speaker mean?
           A Speaker is Tainted if e was not elected to Speaker-Elect
           before becoming Speaker.  A Tainted Speaker is replaced by
           the Speaker-Elect whenever the Office of Speaker-Elect is
           held in normal fashion. (see 5.1.2)  [cf. 1648]

           A Spaker can be Tainted by a Referendum. (Therfore initiating
           a change in Speakers.)  [cf. 1658]

   5.3: What do the Registrar and the Notary do?
      The Registrar's main job is to maintain a list of all Players and
      their email addresses, and a list of all Offices and Officers.  E
      also calls elections for vacant Offices, keeps track of Patent
      Titles, and a few other minor things. (see sections 1.5, 3.2.2)
      [cf. 676, 790]

      The Notary maintains a list of Groups and Contests, and Players in
      the Jurisdiction of their SLCs. (see section 7) [cf. 1458]

   5.4: What do the Assessor and Promotor do?
      Players submit their Proposals to the Promotor, who then
      numbers and distributes them.  This distribution begins the Voting
      Period on those Proposals. (see sections 3.3, 3.4) [cf. 1036]

      Players then send votes to the Assessor, who tallies these Votes
      and publishes the results of the Vote on a Proposal.  In addition,
      the Assessor is the recordkeepor for Extra Votes and Powers.
      (see sections 3.2.1, 3.6, 3.7) [cf. 683, 1477, 1517]

  =5.5: What does the Chancellor do?
      The Banker keeps track of all Marks in the game, and the value of
      the Mil.  In addition, e keeps track of what currencies exist and
      who keeps Records for them. (See section 6) [cf. 1548] 

   5.6: What do the Clerk of Courts and the Justiciar do?
      The Clerk of the Courts is in charge of the judiciary branch of
      Agora.  E receives all CFJs, assigns Judges, distributes CFJs,
      etc. [cf. 991, 951]  In addition, e serves on the Board of
      Appeals. (See section 4) [cf. 911]  

      The Justiciar serves on the Board of Appeals. [cf. 911]

   5.7: What do the Rulekeepor and the Archivist do?
      The Rulekeepor maintains the Ruleset, and every week distributes a
      copy. (see section 1.4) [cf. 1051]

      The Archivist maintains the Archives, which in theory contain all
      prior Proposals, Rules, CFJs, and anything else that ever happened
      in Agora.  (Unfortunately, the record is not quite complete.)
      [cf. 417]

   5.8: What do the Wizard and the Herald do?
      The Tabulator keeps track of Win Tokens and Blots, and every week
      distributes a report containing current holdings of each.
      [cf. 1436]

      The Herald keeps track of Kudos, and every week distributes a
      report containing holdings of each. [cf. 1377]

   5.9: What's an FOIA request, and how can I make one?
      FOIA stands for "Freedom of Information Act" and anything
      protected by it is public record.  About the only thing in Agora
      that is _not_ protected by FOIA is statistics on a Vote
      in progress.  If a Player is requested to provide information
      protected by the FOIA, e must provide it within one week.
      [cf. 1064]

============================================================
6.0: The economy of Agora.
  6.1: What's a Currency?
      A currency is a unit of exchange between players.  There are 
      several types of currencies, each with their own characteristics.  
      All of them share the properties of being quantized, and being 
      transferable between (some) treasuries.

    6.1.1: What's MUQ?
          MUQ stands for Minimum Unit Quantity.  All currencies have a 
          MUQ, and all transfers of currency must be made in integral 
          multiples of this MUQ.  The default MUQ of all currencies, if 
          not specified otherwise, is 1.  [cf. 1577]    

   +6.1.2: What's an Executor?

    6.1.3: What's a Recordkeepor?
          The precise definition of a Recordkeepor is a Player in charge 
          of recording transfers of a specific currency, and the amount 
          of that currency in each Treasury. [cf. 1578]
 
          REMEMBER: "Recordkeepor" in Agora discourse has become a 
          generic term for any Officer or Player whose main job is to 
          record data about the Game State.  So occasionally you might 
          hear the Herald or Wizard referred to as a Recordkeepor,
          though this is-- strictly speaking-- erroneous.  Always bear
          in mind that this usage is distinct from that used in the
          Rules, and should not be used in any official manner
          (Proposals, CFJs, &c.)

   +6.1.4: What's a Transfer Order?  Payment Order?
           What's the Difference?

   +6.1.5: What's Persistant Indebtedness?

  6.2: What Currencies are in the Game, and who keeps track of them?
      The primary currency in the game is Marks, the Recordkeepor of 
      Marks is the Banker. [cf. 1473, 1548]

      Powers and EVs are currencies, and their Recordkeepor is the 
      Assessor. [cf. 1477, 1517]

      Win Tokens are a currency, and their Recordkeepor is the 
      Tabulator. [cf. 1491]

      Each Group has the power to create its own currency, and the 
      Recordkeepor for each Group's currency is that Group's Vizier. 
      [cf. 1620]

    6.2.1: Are Blots and Kudos currencies?  Style Points?
          No.  The primary characteristic of a currency is the ability 
          of a Player who owns a currency is permitted to transfer that 
          currency to another Player.  This is not true of Blots, Kudos, 
          or Style Points, none of which are transferable in the normal 
          sense. [cf. 1435, 1062, 1542]

  6.3: Can I transfer Currencies to other Players?  How?
      Yes.  That is the main univeral characteristic of currencies.  As
      long as you have a positive value of any currency in your Treasury
      you can, with some restrictions on certian currencies, transfer
      any amount of that currency (up to the amount you have) to another
      Player's Treasury by sending a message to that currency's
      Recordkeepor.

      With some more restrictions, you may transfer that currency to any
      other Treasury in the game.  [cf.  1596, 1598]

    6.3.1: I know Kudos aren't a currency, but I can transfer
           them, sort of, right?
          Kudos are transferred, but in a way distinct from currencies.  
          Each Player has two Kudo transfers a week.  A Kudo transfer 
          takes one Kudo from some Player, and gives it to another 
          Player (other than the Player doing the transfer.)  To 
          transfer Kudos, a Player sends a message to the Herald stating 
          where the Kudo is coming from, and who it is going to, the 
          message must contain the reason the transfers are being made.  
          [cf. 1378]

============================================================
7.0: The society of Agora.
  7.1: What's an SLC?
      SLC stands for Subordinate Legal Code.  There are a number of
      different kinds of SLC, and they are best thought of as limited-
      power extensions of the Ruleset.  An SLC can be as binding as the 
      Rules, but only within its own limited domain, and usually limited 
      to a subset of the Players. (Again, as with so many general 
      entities in Agora, there's no such thing as a "generic" SLC, the 
      only SLCs are those defined in the Rules.) [cf. 1588, 1595, 1591]

    7.1.1: How do I find SLCs?
          Every SLC has a Player defined as its Maintainer, who must
          provide the SLC e maintains to any Player who requests to see
          it. [cf. 1590]

    7.1.2: What's an Organization?
          An Organization is defined as a specific SLC, a Treasury, and
          the Players within the Jurisdiction of that SLC.  There are
          two types of Organization currently; Groups and Contests.
          [cf. 1528, 766, 1446]

7.2: What's a Group?

   +7.2.1: How do you form a Group?
   +7.2.2: Who can be in a Group?
   +7.2.3: What can the Ordinances do?
 +7.3: What's a Contest?

============================================================
8.0: The language of Agora.
  
  8.1: Rulekeepor?  Promotor?  What's with the misspellings?
  
  8.2: What's with all the e's and eir's?
      These are the Spivak pronouns, created by mathematician
      Michael Spivak.  They are gender-neutral and are the
      preferred pronouns for referring to a person in the Rules.
      The Spivak pronouns were first popularized on Nomic World
      (a predecessor to Agora) by Malcom Ryan, a player whose
      nickname was Blob.  As an amorphous Blob, e used these
      gender-neutral pronouns to refer to emself.

      The Spivak pronouns are:
       e (for he/she)
       em (for him/her)
       eir (for his/her)
       eirs (for his/hers)
       emself (for himself/herself)

      You may occasionally see _eir_ corrupted as _eis_, _em_
      as _eim_ and _emself_ as _eirself_, but these are not
      the recommended forms.

  8.3: EVs?  AI?  TIA?  COTC?  What's with all the acronyms?
      Here are some commonly used acronyms (capitalization may vary):

  8.4: Why are so many words Capitalized for no readily apparent Reason?
      Some words have a specific meaning in Agora, different from their
      meaning in ordinary speech.  For instance, a group is just any
      collection of two or more persons; but a Group is a collection of
      Agora Players, subject to various rules, and able to Vote on
      things (in addition to the Players themselves Voting).

      REMEMBER: Not all words that have a non-ordinary meaning in Agora
      are capitalized, e.g. "random", "as soon as possible".  Look
      through the "Definitions" Category of the Logical Ruleset.
      [cf. 766, 206, 1653, 1023, 1079]

   8.4.1: How did that custom start?
         Rulekeepor Wes took it upon himself to capitalize Words he felt
         were Important.  many of the capitalizations that now exist in
         the Rules were not there in the originally proposed versions of
         those Rules.

============================================================
9.0: History, in-jokes, and miscellany.

 9.1: Who is this "Kelly" person anyway?
     For almost two years (Aug 94-Jul 96), there was a Player named
     Kelly in Agora.  This person was very careful not to specify eir
     gender.  Kelly was a major player in the development of the ruleset
     during eir tenure; you can thank em for much of our modern judicial
     system, as well as the way Currencies work, and the fundaments of
     the legislative system (eir influence there used to be much more
     extensive, but much has been Amended since).

     Unfortunately, due to internet difficulties, Kelly was forced to
     deregister in late July of 1996.  Several months later, a player
     named Scott joined Agora.  Scott has some definite but unspecified
     relationship to Kelly, although Scott isn't saying which.  A number
     of current players believe them to be the same.

 9.2: Err... what is a Walrus?
     A large mammalian sea creature.
   9.2.1: No, I'm serious, what do Walruses have to do with Agora?

 9.3: Why do the Repeals have colors?
     A rather long time ago now (early 1994), Ronald Kunne (then known
     as Stella?) submitted a whole set of Proposals to repeal every
     single rule in the ruleset.  Just a few people took them seriously,
     but those people voted FOR the proposals--all of them!--which,
     subsequently, passed.  Agora was in an uproar, until it turned out
     that the proposals were illegally submitted and didn't count
     anyway.

     This time is now known to Agora historians as the Black Repeals.
     There have since, at various times, been other sets of proposals to
     repeal every rule, which are now traditionally colored.  In Fall of
     1994, there were the Grey Repeals (named by comparison with the
     Black Repeals); a few months later there were the Pink Repeals
     (named after their proposer, Kelly, who was at the time known as
     "the Pink Bimbo"); and then in November there were the Green
     Repeals.  Quite the Agoran tradition, really.

I must admit I am impressed, and at the same time surprized, how much
effort has already gone into this. Really, this aims to be an
alternative to the ruleset - read this instead of the rules, and
you'll know how to play. But I wonder how we could ever hope to keep
this up to date? That would be much more work than maintaining an up
to date ruleset. And whether the effort is worth it - at some point a
new player will have to read their way through the ruleset anyway, I
guess.

What I found good fun and informative to read where the "history" bits
in the last part. Those don't need constant updating, except for
adding new bits, of course (what is a hot potatoe? what is RGB?).

I think it's also especially good to have for the information
on customary/recommended-but-not-required actions, which usually
don't make it into the Ruleset.  Protos, for example, or the
custom of phrasing CFJs so that the desired result (if there is one)
is TRUE.  (Is that last in there?  I don't remember.)

Are we abandoning the "Plots are the only currency inputs" concept, then? I
thought that was one of the more interesting ideas, actually -- make the
Bank mint its own currencies if it needs to pay off debts, instead of just
letting the Chancellor mint more. But I suppose we *can* keep that for
later...

I don't like this. I don't understand why it's so difficult to bill someone
individually for each Structure.

You have the list addresses and descriptions for the official and discussion
lists swapped.

I think there should be special section just for scams and their
histories. In general, Agora needs a professional Historian.
Proto to come.

It certainly makes for a stronger incentive to pay the Fees if all
your Structures are at risk if you don't.

What about the following?

PROTO
Office of Historian

Enact

      There shall be an Office of Historian, whose duty it shall be to
      collect, collate, arrange and publish material pertaining to
      Agora and the activities of its players in the form of game
      summaries. These summaries shall be made available to all
      players, and posted to at least the following Usenet newsgroups:
      rec.games.abstract, sci.logic, sci.philosophy.meta,
      sci.philosophy.tech, comp.ai.philosophy, if those newsgroups are
      in existence.  Summaries shall also be posted on the InterNomic
      Mailing List, if that list is in existence. 

      When the Historian posts a note to the public forum stating that
      e has produced a summary and had it posted in accordance with
      this rule, and this note is posted more than four weeks after e
      was last awarded 10 points for posting such a note, e shall be
      awarded 10 points. 

      If any player is dissatisfied with a summary, e may make a CFJ
      stating that the summary is unsatisfactory. The Historian is
      automatically barred from Judging such a CFJ. If the statement
      in the CFJ passes into game custom, then the Historian is
      penalized 15 points. 

      The Office of Historian shall be transferred according to the
      default rules for transference of Offices. 

      The Badge of the Office of Historian shall be a quill. This
      shall be known as the Quill of the Historian.

The first Official Nomic Historian shall be Steve.

Why not requirement payment in advance (without billing).
(Overpayments are held and applied when they become needed.)  This
makes for some extra paperwork for the Cartographor (I guess) but
allows a Player to pay a whole bunch of fees at once with one order.

More sensibly the responsibility of the Rulekeepor.

More sensibly the responsibility of the CotC.

Should be done by the Registrar.

I can see some sense in using the Archivist as a central repository,
but it makes no sense to for the Archivist to reproduce work already
done by other Officers, or to do work that other Officers are in
a much better position to do. (ii) in particular is obviously the
province of the Rulekeepor.

What I'd like to see happen is a major overhaul of the duties of the
Archivist, to turn eir position into that Official historian. My idea
is that each week (or whatever period), the Archivist would select
among research topics submitted by Agorans, including emself if e wishes,
and undertake to write a brief historical treatise on the subject.
I envisage typical topics might be "The history of R1442", "The Hot
Potato Scam", "The Black Repeals" (if any further exegesis on that topic
were felt to be needed). The Archivist would then get paid for eir
work. Over time, a body of historical research would get built up,
which I would regard as a very good thing.

So, there are actually two subjects here. Firstly, how to modernise
the current duties of the Archivist. Which need to be kept and which
modified or assigned to other Officers? And how to write legislation
governing the historical duties I intend for the Archivist?

With input from the other Players, I intend to develop a Proposal
to achieve these aims, and it is on this platform that I will be
campaigning for Archivist.

If the objection is simply to the paperwork involved in executing
a PO for each Structure, the language employed in 'Split the
Assessor's functions' to relieve the Assessor of the need to issue
a PO for each vote cast can be adopted for this purpose. But I
suspect that Harlequin's was not merely objecting to the extra
paperwork, but to the idea that failure to pay Maintenance on
one Structure results in the loss of all Structures.

I wouldn't normally be one to put a flippant answer in the FAQ,

I'd have no problem in general doing this, as long as I could
be provided with the information (or, as much of it as still
exists).  Just a few caveats, though: Inasmuch as this might
involve reconstructing old Rules from Proposals, I can't
promise that it would be done with any sort of alacrity.
Secondly, due to memory limits on dfw.net, I probably wouldn't
be able to keep them online, and there might therefore be
a slight delay (on the order of a few days) in responding to
requests.

Also, it seems silly to me to require that all historical
Rules have to be kept concatenated into a single
"historical Ruleset."

I like the idea of distributing the current archivist duties
among several relevant Officers.  I'm not so sure about
having an Office to write historical research, though.  It
seems that this is at least somewhat covered by our current
concept of Theses and Degrees.  Rather than having an Officer
required to write a historical treatise each week, why not
just further encourage the writing of Theses?  Perhaps, for
example, rewards could be given for theses even if they do
not lead to a new degree.

I disagree with that analysis. The reason we have inflation is that
inputs (Currency leaving the Bank and going into circulation) exceed
outputs (Currency leaving circulation and returning to the Bank).
Now admittedly, a taxation Proposal such as you outline here is one
way of forcing outputs to at least equal inputs - but the fact 
that it's forced is the main reason to oppose it. The general thrust
of all the recent efforts to get a balanced and interesting economy
where commodities are scarce and therefore valuable has been to
achieve this without using brute force, by designing a system in
which commodities are more difficult to obtain than they are to spend. 
A taxation proposal which doesn't address the excess of inputs
into the economy simply takes blindly with one hand what it gives 
blindly with the other. It makes much more sense simply not to
give so much in the first place and so obviate the need for
taking.

Rule 1756/0 (Power=1)
Delinquent Judges

      The Clerk of the Courts shall recuse from a CFJ any Judge who is
      delinquent upon the demand of any two Players.  A Player demands
      the recusal of a delinquent Judge by posting eir demand in the
      Public Forum.

      A Judge recused for delinquency commits the Infraction of
      Judicial Delinquency, which bears a penalty of 2 Blots to be
      reported by the Clerk of the Courts.

Under what circumstances is a Judge held to be delinquent? The term
is not used in any other Rules in the Ruleset.

Also, am I right in thinking that the CotC more or less has the
power to decide whether a late Judge  cops a 1 VT penalty or a 3
Blot penalty, by deciding whether or not to wait for a late Judge's
Judgement before reporting the Infraction of Judging Late?

This could be formalised by creating a "Maintenance Account" for each
player - an entity which could own Ergs, whose executor was the Carto-
grapher. Players could transfer Ergs into their Accounts (or even into
each others') whenever they wanted. The Cgr could then execute transfers
from the Accounts to the bank, whenever Maintenance needed to be paid.

I agree. Agora has a long and glorious history, and it should not go
unrecorded. 

I have little to suggest as to how it should be implemented, but I do
feel that there should be a mechanism for players to formally submit an 
annotation to any of the Historian's Reports, to help keep the history
books honest. :)
