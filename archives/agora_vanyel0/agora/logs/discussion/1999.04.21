Hmmm... Same holds for me - it's in the spam folder ('website traffic' to
me shows spam). Although I must say I never was a very great spam fighter -
I merely have a spam folder to read and delete every two weeks.

</color>After more thought, I think either of Misrepresentation, 
Falsification, or Impersonation would apply. I don't necessarily 
condemn the act itself as harshly as Scott does; but all of its 
implications, definitely including Criminal ones, should be carefully 
examined.


It is also possible, as Scott notes, that the Proposals might have 
failed to meet legal requirements - I'm thinking more of Rule 1483's 
"clear indication" criterion. Steve deliberately framed his Proposal 
submissions in such a manner as to make it unclear that they were 
Proposals; that was, in fact, the whole point. (You have to agree 
with Steve to the extent that passing legislation which made such a 
murky situation possible might not have been such a hot idea.)

It wasn't appended. It was buried in the text of the message, about
three quarters of the way through. If you read to the end, you must have
skipped right over it.

I'm rather unmoved by these two claims. Opposing proposed or current 
legislation is fair play, as long as one abides by the Rules. Neither 
should manipulating the Rules, for whatever purpose, be considered 
objectionable. I'm undecided on the charge of hypocrisy - you could 
defend the tactic of using some legislation you opposed to defeat 
that same legislation as neatly ironic - there's this catchy American 
phrase, "turnabout is fair play", which I think might apply.

The important point as far as I'm concerned is whether one can be 
allowed to get away with, as Vlad aptly puts it, "subvert[ing] the 
Good Faith basis of communications" - not that this hasn't been done 
to a lesser extent on previous occasions (there are some Way Cool 
players who have used related tactics), but I would say that a line 
has been crossed here.

The mail headers were not forged. I don't have the expertise to do that.
The spam mail I used to encase the Proposal was a genuine piece of spam
mail that was sent to a friend of mine. He bounced it to the
agora-business list at my request, where I received it as list
administrator. I simply inserted the Proposal paragraph, adjusted
the datestamps to make it more inconspicuous, and forwarded it on using
the majordomo approve script.

I did warn everyone that we would all have to be on our guard. I
explicitly warned against the possibility of a person trying to slip a
Proposal past the rest of the Players. I warned that Summary Adoption
had removed crucial safeguards against the passage of an arbitrary
Proposal. I was pooh-poohed. Summary Adoption made a scam like An Object
Lesson inevitable, and I would have continued to be very nervous indeed
until it was repealed.

As for my "nefarious purposes", consider what I did *not* do with an
opportunity to entrench any text I wished into the Ruleset at Power = 4.
If I were motivated by a lust for power as you say I am, I could have
adopted a Proposal saying:

      Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding:

      - a Proposal is adopted if only if Steve consents to it in the
      Public Forum;

      - Steve is the Judge of all CFJs;

      - Steve is the sole Justice on all Boards of Appeal.

I did not do this, because I know from experience how futile absolute
power is in a game like this. But I was afraid someone without that
experience might try it first. So I acted to repeal Summary Adoption -
in the best interests of the game. I awarded myself nothing - no wins,
no Currency, no Patent Titles. 

I can sleep easy now that the loophole opened by Summary Adoption is
closed. Or at least, I would be able to if it were not seriously being
Proposed to ban me from the game 6 months for executing a scam.

Quite. "Turnabout is fair play" is the essence of scamming. Using the
loophole to close the loophole. 

I feel justified in acting as I did because:

1. The danger was real. The scam itself is proof of that.
2. The danger could not have been removed using normal means, since an
   AI = 3 Proposal would have been required to repeal R1883.

I think everybody is going overboard in condemning Steve. Sure, he broke
our gentleman's agreement not to abuse the communications system, but 
only after pointing out how ridiculously insecure Summary Adoption was.

I agree that such behaviour should not become commonplace - we could
not survive it - but I am willing to accept it happening from time to
time, when the cause merits it. In my mind, Steve's scam is more 
honourable than my own. At least he was endeavouring to close a loophole
in the rules, whereas I was just making a grab for points. I do think
it was unstylish of him to force a Separation of Powers on us in the
process, but that it forgivable. Certainly he has done nothing to deserve
being expelled from the game!

And I also feel it is rather inappropriate for people who have abandoned
the game to hang around and cast aspersions on the Players. If I could,
I would deKudo Scott for his recent behaviour.

How do you answer to the other charges, though ? In particular, how 
do you justify violating the spirit if not the letter of TIA, and - a 
point which your description of how the spam-mail was generated 
highlights - abusing your powers as Distributor ? This position is 
particularly sensitive - if we can't trust the Distributor, the whole 
game breaks down; the Distributor can block Proposal submissions or 
Voting messages, and by its very nature the position cannot be 
effectively regulated by the Rules. I would think that Scott has a 
point when he suggests that the manner in which the scam was 
perpetrated is potentially far more damaging to the Game than what 
the scam itself did (or undid) ?

I would still call it mail header forgery.  Whether you did it manually
(which you admit you *did* do with the datestamps) or had a script
do it for you, however, even if it's not "forgery", I believe it
still falls under the purview of R1497.

In other words, you abused the public trust invested in you by virtue
of being Distributor.  This particular scam relies on an improper
manipulation of the email system made possible only because you own
the mailing lists.  As such, I consider it reprehensible.  This is a
an abuse of trust of the worst sort, and should be punished as
severely as possible.

I was monitoring the game to see if conditions would change so as to
render it suitable to be played again.  I am disappointed that Steve,
instead of rectifying his odious behavior, has taken the opportunity
to magnify upon it further and commit what I honestly believe to be
the most heinous crime possible in Agora.  

I do not believe that Agora can survive if it does not impose a very
severe penalty for this sort of abuse of trust.  Steve should, at the
very least, be stripped of his authority as Distributor, and harshly
punished.  I would prefer that he be banished.

If he is permitted to profit from his malfeasance, I am afraid that my
long affiliation with Agora will, indeed, be at its final end.

I'm not certain this is really necessary; Barring Steve from Judging 
a related CFJ should be sufficient, preventing him from sitting on 
such CFJs as either Judge or Justice. Individual Callers and Judges 
do not need particular protection from Misrepresentation of their 
views, since it would be easy for them to verify that anything Steve 
publishes as CotC conforms to their actual submissions. There's the 
matter of Steve being able to select Judges, but that can be 
countered by the Barring mechanism - and it's not a conspiracy we're 
dealing with here, but an isolated act.

It seems to me that there are two separate issues here; one is the 
eventual need for extralegal sanctions appropriate to the charges of 
"subverting the good faith basis of Agoran communications" (I like 
that phrase), and we have no specific mechanism for imposing such 
sanctions, other than ad hoc Proposals such as Vlad's; and there's 
the possible Criminal acts which Steve might have committed, but 
those were not committed by Steve in his capacity as CotC and I'm 
therefore not certain that the situation warrants Impeachment, 
although I understand Chuck's concerns.

It doesn't have to be a "conspiracy in advance", if you will.  If
there's a single other Player sympathetic to Steve's views, Steve
can appoint em as Judge to all CFJs relating to this matter.  Once
we find out about this that Player can be barred too, but several
CFJs may already have been judged by them.

I also think you underestimate the threat of an officer willing to
engage in Misrepresentation.

The "danger" is that an unscrupulous Player can manipulate the
game's "hardware" in order to influence its "software". You have
shown yourself to be such a Player. The danger isn't Summary Adoption,
it is you. The danger isn't removed, since I honestly don't know
what you are capable of. I consider all of the following real
"dangers" at present:

* You divert or delay certain voting messages to influence the
results of Proposals.

* You edit official reports as they come through so that you get
extra VTs or P-Notes. If the fact is discovered, the officer gets
blamed, not you (heck, you could even give *them* extra goodies,
then use that as an excuse to call for impeachment.)

* You impersonate a new Player in order to increase your influence 
(harvel, we're going to need proof of your identity).

* You send threatening letters to the White House in my name in
order to divert my attention with an FBI investigation.

[As a side note, I don't think Blob's scam was worse than Steve's.
If Steve had simply given himself 20 VT's, I'd be much more likely to
let it slide. His protests that he didn't give himself dictarial
powers are ingenuous, since he did pass substantive legislation
without giving others the fair opportunity to comment on it.
Subtlety is not the same as innocuousness, as we have seen.]

I have not suggested that anyone would.  If you believe this is my basis
for impeachment, you should re-read my post calling for impeachment
more carefully.

I am not particularly worried by the argument that Steve would commit
Misrepresentation, either, as I am not convinced that he thought he was
committing it in the Scam message.

The point has been brought up that this game has depended on Players not
forging mail.  But I consider it even more important that it has depended
on believing Players on their words.

Greetings,

This isn't proof, of course, but I registered as a Watcher in June 1998, well
before Summary Adoption came about.  (Of course, I could have been created
"just in case"...)

Further, I voted FOR the Referendum (although I am beginning to regret doing
so).  I doubt that Steve would (had e the chance) vote for such a thing.
(Then again...)

A week ago I would have sworn that Steve would be the last Player
to forge an email for his own gain.

We did this with many such rules under the banner of "pragmatism' or some
such.  Note that if Steve's post was actually illegal, then there could be
a lawyer's talking point that it had no legal force. As things stand, the
crimes committed in posting it do not bar it from having its effect.

I too originally felt that Steve had gone too far. But I do not now think
that he deserves removal from the game.

Steve's recent action conforms in many ways to the grand old scamming
tradition of Agora Nomic. He used a loophole to plug the same loophole.  He
did not take any further advantage of the awesome power of that loophole,
other than to pass a Proposal that might well have passed anyway (Sep. of
Powers), and to leave a reminder in the Rules (like "A Monument to Threat",
which (alas) never made it).

Even his fiddling with the e-mail header has an honourable precedent, as it
was (I think) this very method that was used to establish the junta in
Tabula (Michael?).

This whole scam could have been executed without diddling e-mail headers or
using the special powers associated with the Distributor.  That would have
been far more stylish, and would not have inspired such a wrathful
response.  As it is, it's a little like the Wizard in a MUD winning by
blocking out everyone else's access for a few days during a critical period.
