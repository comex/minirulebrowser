My situation is such that I will be willing to put time in on economic
and administrative issues, but do not have time to adventure.  I have
a JD to pursue, and two kids who are extremely skilled at sucking up
what little time is left me by my employment. :)

Some gods and wizzes have chosen to participate in the legal
system as citizens. There is a clear understanding (among these participants)
that if the legal system attempts to compel them (as citizens) to perform 
tasks that are impossible (or undesirable from a game management point of view)
for `normal' citizen they'll simply de-register as citizens and not 
participate.

Basically wizzes agree to abide by a set of rules which 
are outside the realm of normal players and the legal system.
These are basically things like `don't waste disk space', `don't 
abuse powers to abuse players', etc. 

There have not been any direct problems between those that are wizzes 
and citizens of the legal system as yet. I can envisage areas that could
be problematic in some circumstances which would require the wizzes to 
deregister as citizens. But you have to remember most citizens of
Sanom are really only interested in `common' law to run the world
`fairly' rather than the meta-legal issues that Agora tends to immerse 
itself in.

Yay. More bloody bookkeeping! :(

As for the current Accountor's report, I am working on it.
I have been writing some s/ware to handle some of the bookkeeping.
I thought it was stable, and so just entered all the actions for the
last week and a half. It didn't work. :(

I certainly didn't receive these e-mails.  Something's wrong
somewhere, but anyway, I will issue the appropriate vacating orders
and corrections.

CotC Michael.

PS: if you can send me message-IDs for the two messages as well, I may
be able to ask for a system wide check as to whether or not we
received the mail.  This might help in tracking down the problem
between us.

I'm not sure how one gets message-IDs; are these generated by the
mailer itself or an SMTP server ? My mailer apparently doesn't
generate them, or make a note of them if the server tells it about
them.

OFF: appeal of CFJ 1100 continues with Morendil replaced

H. Scorekeepor,

Please note that Morendil loses 6 points as a result of the Blots described below.

-- Herald Crito

>>> Michael Norrish <Michael.Norrish@cl.cam.ac.uk> 08/13/98 04:25am >>>

Indulgences.

returned decisions already, and they are on the case-sheet.

Appelate decisions
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Clerk of the Courts Michael:

I hereby OVERTURN the decision above.  The Judge relies on Rule 1808
specifying that Private Orders be made directly to the recipient
Player.  However, we know from the higher precedence Rule 478 that
sending something to the Public Forum is equivalent to sending it to
every player (directly).  Therefore, though sending things via a
mailing list might seem to be indirect, the legal fiction of R478
makes us conclude otherwise.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Speaker Steve:

I hereby SUSTAIN lee's Judgement that the Statement is FALSE.

This Judgement is in three sections. In the first section, I explain
the substance of lee's Judgement; in the second, I consider three
arguments against the Judgement, and reject them all; in the third, I
consider the role of the Board of Appeals.

1. The substance of lee's Judgement.

Let us begin by examining lee's Judgement itself. On the key question
on which the Appeal turns, Judge lee was in his actual Judgement
almost telescopically brief. The Order issued by Macross being Private
Orders (which no-one denies), Judge lee argued that:

      Since they were Private Orders, they are executed by submission
      directly to the Player to be commanded, as per Rule 1808/0.
      Since these were submitted to the Public Forum rather than
      directly to Player Swann, these orders were never executed and
      never took effect.

Thus Judge lee interpreted the phrase "submitting them directly" in
R1808 as requiring that Private Orders be submitted directly to the
subject of the Order, as opposed to being communicated via the Public
Forum. From this follows the obvious conclusion that Macross never
Ordered Swann to do anything, and so that Swann could not have
committed the Crime of Contempt by Action. This act of interpretation
was merely implicit in his Judgement. But it was explicit in a defence
of his Judgement lee posted to the business list the following day, in
which he said:

      In particular, i looked at the way the word directly is used in
      Rule 1808/0. In other many places in the Rules, there are
      specifications about Nomic Entity being submitted to another
      Nomic Entity, such as a Player or an Officer.  Only in this Rule
      does it specify that something a Nomic Entity is to be submitted
      directly.  The phrase is unique. However i did not find it
      ambiguous.

      I reasoned that if posting a statement to the Public Forum
      saying it was an Order to a Player were sufficient to execute an
      order, then the language of Rule 1080/0 would be more like the
      language that specifies how Appeals are submitted to the CotC,
      or more like the language in many other Rules. In addition, if
      there were no other more direct way to contact a Player, then
      the language in Rule 1080/0 would be ambiguous.

      In an Official report, the Registrars Report, the email address
      of each Player is given.  Thus, in an official document, a way
      to directly contact a Player, other than a message to their
      attention in the Public Forum, is given.

      To me it was unambiguous that according to Rule 1080/0 that
      Private orders had to be submitted not simply to the Public
      Forum, but rather to that Player in a more direct fashion.
      Since the Rule seemed clear to me, i could not even consider
      game custom. I knew my ruling would be inconvenient, but i felt
      compelled by the Rules to judge the way that I did.  I gave this
      more consideration than some Players would have, and for that I
      have been insulted in the Public forum.


2. Arguments against the Judgement considered, and rejected.

This reasoning, and the Judgement more generally, has been attacked on
three separate grounds. I propose to deal with these in order from the
least serious to the most serious grounds.

Firstly, it has been argued that if the Judgement is allowed to stand,
then a great many Private Orders, including a very large number of
Transfer Orders, will turn out to have been invalid, with consequences
for the game state that will at the very least be difficult and at
worst impossible to calculate. This is true, but it is not an argument
for overturning the Judgement. Agora has suffered crises of this kind
before and survived them. We do not yet know how much work
recalculating the game state will be. Perhaps it will turn out to be
achievable after all, and we might decide to attempt it. Or we might
decide not to attempt it, or discover that the task is impossible,
(for example, because we have no records of whether certain messages
were sent to the PF or privately to Recordkeepors), in which case we
might be forced to Ratify portions of the game state using the
Ratification (or some other) mechanism.  We've done it before, and if
necessary we can do it again. And in any case, some Players have
recently been arguing that we don't have to correct mistakes made in
the past but can just let them be and move on (compare the response to
Kolja's Judgement of CFJ 1101).

Secondly, it has been argued that lee's Judgement conflicts with prior
Judgements, in particular with the Judgements returned in CFJs 1094,
1095, and 1097, all of which confirmed that the various Orders issued
in connection with the Coup d'Étât were legal and valid
Orders. However, none of the Judges in those CFJs considered the
question of the correct interpretation of R1808 which lee raises in
his Judgement. One way of seeing this situation would be to say that
since those Judgements address different questions, the question of
conflict between the Judgements simply does not arise. A different way
of seeing the situation would be to say that if the point lee is
making is correct, then the prior Judges were simply in error in
finding those Orders to be legal and valid. But on either way of
seeing it, lee's Judgement deserves to be considered on it's own
merits.

But what are those merits? The third and most serious challenge to the
validity of lee's Judgement alleges that lee did in fact err in law,
in that he ignored the requirement placed on Judges by R217 to
consider game custom. The argument runs that since the meaning of
R1808 is unclear, game custom should have led the Judge to conclude
that Private Orders can be legally executed by submitting them to the
Public Forum since this has been our common practice. This argument
can only be as compelling as is its premise that R1808 is
unclear. Judge lee considered this question in the defense of his
Judgement, quoted above. He said that the wording of the Rule appeared
to him to be unambiguous, and hence that game custom did not enter
into the question. He is certainly correct in his understanding of
R217: if the wording of R1808 is clear, then not only did lee not have
to consider game custom, he was not permitted by the Rules to do so,
and was in fact compelled, as he claimed to be, to Judge according to
the clear meaning of the text of R1808, game custom to the contrary
notwithstanding.

But is the meaning of R1808 clear? A definitive answer to that
question is probably impossible. Judgements of clarity are a vague and
subjective matter, about which rational people may disagree. But even
judgements about matters of taste can be more or less arbitrary. It is
proper for the Board of Appeals to ask: was lee's judgement that R1808
is clear a judgement that a reasonable person was entitled to make? My
view as a Justice is that Judge lee was entitled to take the view of
R1808 that he did. The construal he gave of the word "directly" as it
appears in that Rule is in my view by far the most natural of the
interpretations that were available to him. No other candidate
interpretation comes close enough to this one to being reasonable to
make the Rule ambiguous.  Therefore, lee was within his rights as
Judge to view R1808 as being clear, and hence to ignore game custom.


3. The role of the Board of Appeals.

This Appeal affords me a welcome opportunity to expand upon views I
have already stated elsewhere about the proper role of the Board of
Appeals.  As is probably well known by now, I have often stated (as I
did, for example, in my Judgement of the Appeal of CFJ 921) that one
should be reluctant to overturn Judgements unless they are mistaken in
law or set a bad precedent. In this Judgement we have another
application of that principle. My own views on the clarity or
unclarity of R1808, whether they are in agreement with lee's or not,
are not to the point. What is important is whether lee's view was one
that a reasonable person was entitled to take of the situation. In
making his Judgement, what lee has really done is contribute a
creative act to the game, a considered act borne out of his own
particular set of aesthetic responses to the situation. In my view the
proper role of the Board of Appeals is to encourage such creative
contributions to the game by respecting them as much as possible.

======================================================================
Original Judgement: FALSE

Reaons and arguments:

The orders that Swann believes e disobeyed were issued by Player
Macross in the same message as e registered as a Player. I believe
that Player Macross did not hold office and e was not a Judge, and was
not on the board of appeals at the time e issued the Orders. Since
Macross did not hold office and e was not a Judge, and was not the
Board of Appeals, eir Orders were private as per Rule 1794/0.  Since
they were Private Orders, they are executed by submission directly to
the Player to be commanded, as per Rule 1808/0.  Since these were
submitted to the Public Forum rather than directly to Player Swann,
these orders were never executed and never took effect.  It is not
required that Players obey Orders not in effect, therefore Player
Swann could not have disobeyed orders.  Therefore e never committed
the crime of Contempt by Action as defined in Rule 1811/0.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

I believe that Macross' Orders were valid, and when I published the
message entitled "No New Player Tyranny"-- either through accident or
excessive enthusiasm-- I violated Rule 1811 and committed a Class C
Crime.  I plead no contest and will not appeal the Judge's verdict on
the matter. I only hope is that the Agora public will recognize this as
a genuine accident and not a willful and hypocritical flouting of the
principles I've been wont to expouse.

Appelate decisions
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Clerk of the Courts Michael:

I hereby SUSTAIN the decision above.  The rule in question states that
one may exempt oneself from judicial service for a specific CFJ by
specifying that CFJ in a message to the Clerk of the Courts.  I
believe the language requiring the mention of a specific CFJ thereby
requires the request for exemption to be made when that CFJ actually
exists.  A CFJ can only really be said to come into existence when
submitted, as per Rule 991.

======================================================================

Original Judgement: TRUE

Reasons and arguments:

The question is not new to me; the practice of making oneself
ineligible to judge all CFJs called in a certain period of time has
always struck me as against the letter of rule 1567. This never
bothered me very much, as I think it is nice to have this
possibility. I consider this an interesting example where game custom
quietly accepted a practice that is against the letter of a rule; I
think that a challenge of such custom in a CFJ is enough reason to
change it and go back to the rules proper.

I hope, however, that noone will advocate changes in past CFJ
assignments that respected ineligibilities illegal under this
CFJ. Anyone who thinks about doing so should have formally challenged
the practice when it was begun.

======================================================================

Motions
-------

1. Motion to Annotate:

I hereby file a Motion with the Judge of this CFJ that R1567 be
annotated with a copy of the Statement.  -- Steve

<Granted>
======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

I begin with the general observation that being eligible to Judge a
CFJ is a Nomic property of Players in the sense of R1011, and hence
can only be changed by procedures specified in the Rules. Hence if the
procedure described in R1567 for changing one's eligibility to Judge a
CFJ does not permit Players to make themselves ineligible to Judge
CFJs which have not yet been called (as I contend), then, since no
other Rule specifies such a procedure, that action is simply not
permitted by the Rules at all, and the Statement is TRUE.

The first paragraph of R1567 itself states that:

      A Player makes emself ineligible to be the Judge of a specific
      CFJ by transmitting a notice to the Clerk of the Courts,
      specifying the CFJ for which e wishes to be made ineligible.

Attention should be drawn here to two points about this paragraph. The
first is that it describes a procedure for making oneself ineligible
to Judge 'a specific CFJ'. The second point is that the procedure
described requires the the Player to specify 'the CFJ for which e
wishes to be made ineligible'. I submit that a CFJ which has not yet
been called and hence does not yet exist cannot meet the requirements
of specificity in R1567. "All CFJs called in the next two weeks" does
not name a specific CFJ, for example. Neither does "Any CFJ called by
Chuck in the next month." Even "Any CFJ called by Chuck in the next
three days concerning the interpretation of Rule 1567" does not, I
claim, name a specific CFJ, even if Chuck actually makes a CFJ
matching that description. 'A specific CFJ' can only refer to a CFJ
which already exists in the full particularity of its details: its
text, who called it, and when it was called.

I don't actually want to reify the currencies of Agora, I would prefer
that the dollar, if that is to be our currency, have its own value. 
The problem is that  we need a way to get dollars in the economy
without making them too common.  

But I am not opposed to trade.  In order to gain value initially the
currency could be backed by Agoran currency, like the dollar was once
backed by gold and silver.  However the MUQ of the Agoran currency is
too high; it will make dollars too dear i think.  if a dollar were
worth one  MuQ of a VT, we could also have cents below the MUQ.  Cents
are worthless in Agora, but if we can change them for dollars, which
have value backed by VT's.

I didn't get anything from you yesterday.  On that basis, you were
late this morning (after your week had elapsed), so I selected a new
Justice.  If you did actually send me your Judgement yesterday, then I
will retract the lateness orders, and finish the case off. 

Can you produce a time-stamped message from yesterday?  I will take
your word for it if not, but it would be reassuring if so, and it
might also help us figure out why it went astray.  (I take it that the
message didn't bounce.)

Michael.

No wait,  your original message has just arrived.  It seems to have
spent all of yesterday in the machines at your end. 

Some of the headers look like:

Anyway, I'll be vacating those orders.  

It's nice to know that I'm not dropping people's mail on a regular
basis, possibly just Morendil's, and then only if he uses his
alternate strategy.

Well i discovered some problems on my email server that affected
messages set yesterday and early today, but I thought That the message
containing my decision went out yesterday morning.  In any case i
resent it this morning and  from this:

One idea is to have the MOOBank pay out interest based on time spent 
online, and provide every player with a little capital to get them started.
Of course something needs to be done to take money *from* players,
which means having things to sell.

Good. In fact, I believe this will be the only way to go if we get
involved in two MUDs at the same time.

Exactly. Getting there with respect to VTs has taken Agora several
years of finetuning, and several wholesale destructions of all VTs in
existence.

>>
But I am not opposed to trade.  In order to gain value initially the
currency could be backed by Agoran currency, like the dollar was once
backed by gold and silver.
<<

I guess this is the only way to create a MUD currency at the
moment. It requires some trustworthy institution, however, that
collects Agora currency, issues correpsonding MUD currency and pays
out Agora currency to players who return MUD money.

Making one MOO dollar 0.1 VT would be ok. Also note that if a bank
issues MOO dollars to players who pay in a certain amount of VTs (or
P-notes, or indulgences, for that matter), then it can also issue 100
MOO$ per VT. that only means that you can't recover Agora VTs if you
don't have at least 10 MOO$. But in principle the MUQ of the dollar
can be different from that of the "gold" that backs the dollar. One
US-dollar was worth much less than one of the gold bars kept by the
federal reserve in the times of gold backed currencies.

Well i discovered some problems on my email server that affected
messages set yesterday and early today, but I thought That the message
containing my decision went out yesterday morning.  In any case i
resent it this morning and  from this:

>lee you can consider yourself selected as of this message though; so
>you get an extra day to consider if you really want it.

I still think that it would be on time.  Am I mistaken?

I resent everything that I sent out this morning.  I apologize if
things go twice.  I don't understand why they would not show up, as my
server says that they left our site fine.  But since my last message
got through, i think these will to.

Thank you,
I just now received a flood of mail:)  No the message didn't bounce or
I would have known about it yesterday.  The problem at my end was
caused by a moron sending out a message with 50 MB of attachments,
coupled with severe DNS and routing problems at my ISP.  Half the time
I pinged today, i got no response from gecko.

It makes no difference to the selection, but I'm curious: are Justices
who have already delivered a Judgement in an Appeal eligible to be
selected if the case is re-assigned?

A note from the Distributor: aol are reporting that lee's mailbox there is
full, and bouncing all of his mail back to gecko. Since lee is
alternately subscribed at schawk.com, I have removed his aol address
from the lists.

lee's note on logic is true only up to a point. It is only a convention
adopted by orthodox classical logic that "All Fs are Gs" does not imply
"Something is F". It is perfectly possible to adopt the opposite
convention.

Well i also studied alternative mathematical systems where
a^2+b^2=(a+b)^2.  I assumed we use the most traditional conventions
here in Agora, but then I thought i (and my dictionary) knew what
directly means.

If you don't want to know the answer, don't ask the question.

I hereby volunteer to write LPmud code for Agoran type stuff (Vototron,
anyone?) on SW, if the gods there grant me the access to do so.

I would also suggest that anything we choose to automate - on SW or
AgoraMOO - can be written to keep a proper audit trail, and even
generate weekly reports in human-readable form.  That way, if the
system breaks down, or we decide that it's been doing things wrong
and we want to retcon a bunch of its past work, then we can do so.

Probably best to talk to Geoff about that. His address is
<geoff@moo.cs.rmit.edu.au>.
