Sigh.

I hereby tranfer 2 VTs to the Bank to satisfy the above PO for VTs.

I'm seeking Indulgences...I'm going to need 6 of them. I have P-Notes,
and information as Assessor to sell, and I have the Speaker's Right of
Patronage to use as I wish. If you have Indulgences to sell, make me an
offer.

I have a record of Swann CFJing on "Player Swan committed the crime of
Contempt by Action." on May 22, but no record that the CotC distributed
or otherwise processed it.  What happened to that?  Was it submitted
improperly or something?

My records indicate only three messages concerning that CFJ.  The original
message in which Swann made the CFJ, a mention in the illustrious Agoran
Weekly Journal, and, of course, your message now.  It seems that the CotC
dropped the ball on this one.

Strange that no one picked up on this sooner, especially since I seem to
recall that someone (I think it was Steve) mentioned that they thought there
was an unresolved CFJ from the Coup.

I did say something to that effect, Michael made reassuring noises, and
I accepted them. Too hastily, it seems.
