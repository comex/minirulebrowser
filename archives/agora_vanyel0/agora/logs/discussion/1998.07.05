I dispute that this is a "right" or a "privilege". I would term it to be
a "duty" or just a plain requirement, which is not covered by R402.

Acutally, I wonder whether Rule 1662 requires the Gratuity is given
to me or to Steve, who is now Speaker. Or is it another privilege
which I no longer receive?

I would argue that the Speaker's Gratuity is neither a special right
nor privilege, but a payment in recognition of services rendered. In
my view it is payable to you. I was paid my Speaker's Gratuity in
similar circumstances in April. At any rate, the Gratuity cannot be
payable to me, since I was not Speaker continuously (or at all)
during the month of June.

First, let me say that I agree with Blob that R1445 does not make
the Speaker's choice of Election Winner in the case of a tie a
special right or privilege, and that this action is not covered
by R402.

But second, assuming that that were not the case, who in your opinion
*would* get to decide the Election? Me, as the new Speaker?

This is what I'm talking about. Now this useful bug fix proposal has
failed, I've wasted a VT on it, and our game is a little worse off. *This*
is why we need to reinstitute Presence...

Think again. P3764 was to have amended R1766. But P3765 proposed simply
to repeal R1766 outright. Therefore at most one of these Proposals could
be expected to pass. Crito and I decided that we preferred the option
of repeal to that of amendment, and to work together to get P3765
passed, which we succeeded in doing. So the game is no worse off. In
fact, I'd say it's a little better of for having gotten rid of the
Officer's Veto, which I never liked much.
