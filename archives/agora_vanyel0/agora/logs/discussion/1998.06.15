I think the point that the constructionists want to press is that merely
saying that a counter-example can be found in a finite amount of time is
not enough to ensure that the conjecture is provably false.

The latter question seems obviously true if the word "only" is struck;
I haven't formed an opinion on the former question, which is
considerably more complex.

Thanks.  The Official Reports table is not always entirely up to date.
I use it as a baseline for determining salary penalties, but I do
always check my mail archive for missing reports before issuing an
Infraction report.

As you have no doubt noticed, I am discharging my official duties in
rather a batched fashion at the moment.  This is due to work pressures
in "real" life.  I apologise for thereby making the service that bit
less responsive.

My scan of messages I received from you in the date-range May 31 to
June 8 (being paranoid because of time-zone differences) reveals the
following dates and subjects:

Sun, 31 May 1998 17:16:02 -0500 -- OFF: Short Logical Ruleset

The two rulesets above were the previous week's.  Of course, it's
possible that I've missed something, so anyone, please do send me
evidence that I'm wrong if there is any such.

I doubt any constructivist mathematician would say this, though any 
number of constructivist philosophers might.

However, a contructivist mathematician would want to be sure that the
counter-example could be found and proved in a finite amount of time.
Fortunately this is the same as the existence of the counterexample.

Actually, I have heard rumors on sci.math or sci.logic that there are a
few rabid constructivists who think that arbitrarily large finite numbers
may be a contradiction. In particular there is some mathematician/logician
(I don't remember the name) who has tried to prove contradictions from the
Peano axioms.

Wow.  There is no limit to the folly of scholars.

Actually that reminds me of  Yesyenin-Volpin's article on the "highest 
integer to which it is possible to count."  He didn't actually think
this involved a contradiction!  (But I do classify him with the 
philosophers rather than the mathematicians...)

Dear Chuck, 

thanks for your remarks in which you raise a few important points.

>>
Currently, as Rulekeepor, I earn 0.8 VTs a week.  Currently, I may
also own Plots and gain currencies that way as well.

If this were to pass, I would earn only 0.8 VTs a week as Rulekeepor.
Or, I could resign my office, build 2 Mines and 1 Farm, and net 1 VT and
1 Erg per week.  Hardly an incentive to be Rulekeepor!
<<

I'd like to note that for me as ambassador the situation is very much
the same (except that both my workload and my salary are smaller), so
I'm facing the same dilemma. 

At the moment I'd favour your solution 3/4,

>>
3.  Lobby the Chancellor to increase the BOS.  A simple, and reasonable
    solution.
4.  If (3) fails, impeach the Chancellor and get one who will increase
    the BOS.  (Or, replace the Chancellor by other means, such as Rebellion,
    "encouraging" him to step down, or whatever.)  A somewhat lengthy process.
<<

for two reasons: one, this will work (can work quickly), and can be
taken back if inflation rises too much and/or the plots situation is
clearer; two, it will be fun to try this aspect of politics.

Insofar as the rulekeepor's office is special (more, and more tedious
work, than some other officers', and at the same time a stronger
dependence of the game as a whole on this job's quality and
timeliness), you might also consider variant

6.  Propose to raise the rulekeepor's salary to, say, 4 BOS.

In the long run, however, I support Steve's view that income from
plots should be reduced, not officer income increased.

As far as the just distribution of income is concerned, I'd like to
make some more basic remarks.


I believe that Chuck's complaints are on the roleplaying level of
nomicking (although he seems to take this as a rather personal
affair) because all these concepts of "reward for work", "justice"
and so on are necessarily paper tigers - it's a game, after all (and
no matter what we do to the rules, a game in which those who invest
more time have more power, at least in the middle and long run). 

I don't want to use this observation as a weapon against Chuck, but I
think my classification of his remarks as roleplaying is supported by
Steve's observation that Chuck has hardly done anything with the loads
of VTs he made in the last weeks and months. At the same time, while
he didn't vote much, he made a huge contribution to the game, by
performing his duties as rulekeepor in the good and reliable way we've
grown accustomed to, and also by starting debates like the present
one.

So I'd like to urge Chuck to please form his opinion about the
appreciation we as Agorans have for the way he does his job based on
more or less symbolic gestures like the Office in Perpetuity thing and
from our explicit expressions of appreciation, and not from in-game
moves like P3760.


P3760 should be seen in a different context (I'm going into metagaming
mode now, or at least switching to the corresponding mode of arguing
to make my in game point, namely that you should support P3760): as a
contribution to the current drive to use economic structures not just
as something to play around with on the white elephant level, but as a
source and incentive for political playing and making some tough
decisions.

Chuck's post is a wonderful proof of how successful plots, and P3760,
can be at this: It provides a potential incentive to put pressure on
officers to use their political powers in certain ways, and it forces
Chuck (and me, and others) to make the tough decision whether they
want to be officers or landowners. (If the decision wasn't tough, it
would be just another white elephant; if it hurts, it works - same
goes for Critos recent remarks about our possible inability to pass
even important proposals. If we always pass all of them, our VT
economy is just a huge waste of time, and we could also do without
it).


Concerning the latter, tough decision I'd like to add some
remarks. Number one: we should count performing officers duties as
part of the fun of playing nomic. Granted, the rulekeepor's job is one
of the hardest, and one we depend on very strongly. But still, I hope
Chuck is not doing this only because he needs the 2 VTs salary (and if
he desperately want a higher salary, consider the above variant 6.,
which I'd support, by the way). So the question is: will having some
offices be more fun, or playing a simple plot owner - given the amount
of time I'm willing to invest?


This leads to the first design idea for P3760: Give players with a low
time budget a more interesting alternative to just being unemployed,
while keeping the more active players (who often hold multiple
offices) from dominating the game too much (a trend that is strong at
the moment, with very few officers earning a lion's share of the
overall salary payments. If these players also become the most
successful plot owners, because they work on it harder than others,
we'll either end up with a huge inflation, or with still scarce
currency but even more power in the hands of even fewer players than
right now).

The second design idea leads me to remark number two: make the economy
work, and encourage specialization. The latter was a major reason why
plots were proposed in the first place (although there specialization
was just between producers of the different types of currency). The
former requires a limit on the amount of currency brought into
circulation. One very simple way to do this is not to allow everyone
access to every source of income.

Oh my, this post has become much longer than I intended - I'd better
stop now, or you'll never get around to voting for P3760 before the
deadline.


Kolja A.


P.S. to all players who want some special bribes, arguments etc before
they vote on anything: please count this mail as what it is, a good
reason to vote for. I can't (and don't want to) bribe you into voting
for this, becasue a) I'm broke and b) I'd like to drum up support for
good ideas, not scams or personal pets.

Indeed. I support the concept of allowing players to only be land owners or
officers, not both, BUT only as part of a comprehensive Plot Reform package
which gives the Cartographor control over production rates.

One solution: get rid of unemployment benefits (again) and keep the Plot
production level at about that of the Unemployment benefits, i.e. 1/2 the
BOS.

Sounds like the Constructionists have an, um, interesting definition of provability.

I have not received Iris data, although I believe Sherlock had no Irises.  I
will submit a plan based on that assumption this week, if that is
acceptable.

In the Notary's Report of May 31, I incorrectly stated that Sherlock's
Probate had been completed.  I now correctly (I hope) state that Time
Agent's Probate is complete.

Crito, I haven't seen you submit a plan for Sherlock.  I assume that
you have "received" VT/P-Note/Indulgence data from yourself.  Have you
received Iris data from Harlequin?  If so, then you've probably
violated ASAP; if not, then Harlequin certainly has.

The situation is beginning to clarify. I believe Scott will argue
that R1843 requires Players to do something impossible in order 
to purchase their first 3 Plots, namely, transfer 0 VTs to the
Bank, which R1598 does not allow.

Well, I'm still making up my mind about all of this. But it seems to
me that at bottom the constructionists have an important point to
make: our concepts cannot outrun our own ability to apply them. There
cannot be such a thing as the application of a concept totally
independently of our ability to determine whether that application is
correct. They are, after all, our concepts, and it's up to us to say
when they are correctly applied. When the platonist mathematician
commits emself to saying that Goldbach's Conjecture is at this time
determinately either provably true or provably false, it is incumbent
upon them to say something - something nonmysterious - about the
concept of 'proof' to which they are appealing. If the platonist's
response to this challenge is to appeal to some concept of 'proof'
which completely transcends of our ability to determine whether that
concept is correctly applied in particular cases, then it seems to me
that it is the platonist who has the, er, interesting definition of
provability.

Which effectively prohibits a R1843 para. 2 purchase.  However,
para. 3 purchases are still possible; if I am now mistaken, nothing
prohibits the Chancellor, as Executor of the Bank, from transferring
Plots to other Players under whatever circumstances e feels
appropriate.  (I can't find anything that would restrain the
Chancellor from selling--or even giving away--the Bank's Plots.)
