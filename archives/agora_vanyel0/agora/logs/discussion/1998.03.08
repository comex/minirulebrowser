Not at all.

On another note:  I intend to send out the next proto of "Plots" shortly,
and hopefully Propose it within the next week.  I believe that Michael is
not particularly interested in the Office of Cartographor in its current
incarnation.  However, who would be interested in the Office as "Plots"
would redefine it?

Very astute observation.

I've stated previously and I restate now. I hate (loath, abhor, detest,
etc.) politics. I don't think I've been here long enough to know the
political candidates. Even if I did know the candidates well I would
probably have abstained anyway.

Et tu, Blob?

You're the one I was trying not to target as much--it was quite
intentional that I did not call for your Impeachment as Promotor.  I
thought I was being a nice guy about that. :(

Well, that doesn't matter, just do like I did--choose a few assorted
people and open fire on them.  I imagine in the long run that will
define your political leanings. ;)

Out of curiousity, does that rule out bribes?

To quote a phrase from the impeachment forces, or agora-discussion, is not
to accuse Sherlock of writing it.

This was rhetoric used earlier by someone else, which I am re-cycling for
effect. ((Though if people don't recognize it as such then the effect is
lost.  I'm really not that good at oratory.  I wish I _had_ Cicero to
defend me, even though the mullets of Marseilles are quite good...))


Am I right in supposing that the Impeachment referenda are supposed to be a
strategic move to force elections for Threat-held offices, while keeping
Morendil, Crito, Kolja A., etc. in Office?  If we don't actually deserve
this, morally speaking, then what is the point?  Except that someone who
lost the previous elections can have another chance to grab Office?

I'm afraid I don't see how you draw your conclusion from these
premises. Take elJefe's Votes, 2 permitted by 206, 2 permitted by
1766. The lower of 'two plus any granted by other Rules' and 'five' 
is, in that instance, four.

Is your argument to the effect that the maximum allowed to a Player,
absent the first sentence of 1766, is two, and that it is that number 
we should take the last sentence of 1766 to refer to ?

I will make no comments on the merits of that interpretation until
and unless it the case reaches a Board of Appeals, should I serve on
such a board, but I would like to note that we have Game Custom of
very long standing (nearly a year and a half) to the effect that a
Rule with a very similar wording, 1660, does indeed authorize the
Speaker to cast a third Vote.

Yes. Since, absent the first sentence of 1766, a player can only make 
two votes, that's the maximum number of votes the player can make.

So, you are essentially arguing that 1766 is self-contradictory ?

What wording of that last sentence would in your opinion have the
intended effect, i.e. that even if a Player is already allowed to
cast four or more Votes by a combination of other Rules, the
additional Voting privileges granted by this Rule cannot exceed the
maximum of five Votes allowed by Rule 206 ?

And how would you interpret Rule 1660 in the light of your claims ?

But Game Custom clearly supports that in some circumstances a Player
may cast three, or even four, Votes.  So clearly two is not the
maximum number of Votes a Player can make.

I would suggest that "" would have the intended effect.

Rule 206 is a Power 2 Rule with an explicit precedence clause.

I don't see how you can play this game and avoid politics. Even your
decision not to vote for anyone was a political one, and it had significant
political effect.

Or self-depriving.  However, I think this contradicts the canon that
the Rules should be interpreted to give each Rule as much meaning as
possible.

This is something I've wondered about.  Why does "Game Custom" exist
at all?  Shouldn't the Ruleset be read without prejudice towards
previous occurrences?  If a Rule specifically prohibited some action,
but for years it was ignored and a different course was taken, would
"Game Custom" prevail?

Also, with the absence of any written "Game Custom", does this
discriminate against new players in that they might infer something
from the Rules that is completely legitimate, but is then invalidated
because the other Players say "that's not how we do it"?

I'm not trying to be argumentative here, just trying to understand an
issue I'm a bit unclear on.

No. Well, sort of.

None at all. Rule 206 has a higher precedence, and the five-vote 
limit has a precedence clause giving it power over all other rules, 
so the best way to give the intended effect would be to leave out the 
last sentence altogether.

> And how would you interpret Rule 1660 in the light of your claims ?

Rule 1660 is a bit more muddled, since the last sentence does not say 
'... that can be cast by that Player.', but instead says '... that 
can be cast by a Voting Entity.' I am not sure whether that has the 
intended effect or not, but IMO, it is entirely plausible for Rule 
1660 to have effect and Rule 1766 not to, since the two clauses have 
an important difference. If Rule 1660 said 'that Voting Entity' or 
'any Voting Entity' or 'the Speaker', I would agree that it has no 
effect either. However, I think 'a Voting Entity' could be 
interpreted to mean Voting Entities in general, and that is how it 
has been interpreted.

If some other rule raises the number of votes that player can make, 
that player's maximum is higher than two. However, Rule 1766 clearly 
says it doesn't raise the maximum number of votes 'that Player' can 
cast.

Actually, I didn't notice that. My apologies. Still, I don't see why
I should receive that privilege, when Gen Chaos has been an exemplary
Assessor, and elJefe an excellent CotC for some time now. If they don't
deserve to keep those Offices, I don't see why I do.

Or are you favouring me because I am a more political moderate than the
other guys?

Heh.  It's a much simpler reason than that.

A brief look into the history of "Game custom".

Our current rules refer to Game custom in only one place:

> Rule 217/3 (Power=1)
> Judgements Must Accord with the Rules
> 
>      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however,
>      if the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the

This has changed very little since the initial ruleset, written by
Chuck:

> 217.  All judgements must be in accordance with the rules; however, if
>       the rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the statement
>       to be judged, then the Judge shall consider game custom and the
>       spirit of the game before applying other standards.

This in turn goes back to the original ruleset of Nomic World, authored
by Steve and Geoff Wong:

> 101. Obey The Rules
>
> All players must always abide by all the rules then in effect, in the
> form in which they are then in effect, and interpreted in accordance with
> currently existing game custom.
>
> 215. Judgements Must Accord With The Rules
> 
> All Judgements must be in accordance with all the rules then in effect.
> When the rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the statement in
> question, however, then the Judge shall consider currently existing game
> custom and the spirit of the game in reaching a decision.
> 
> 216. Judgements Are Not Rules
>
> If a statement on which Judgement has been called is Judged to be true,
> and that Judgement is not overruled, it does not thereby become a rule, or
> any part of a rule.  It merely becomes an explicit part of currently
> accepted game custom.

Interestingly, this appears to give a different meaning to "game custom",
referring more explicitly to the body of past judgements, than some vague
sense of "the way things are done". Notice that this is clearly _not_
what "game custom" in our ruleset, since rule 217 refers to both "game
custom" and "past Judgements".

In Suber's initial ruleset rule 212 reads, in part:

> 212: 
>    ...
>
>    New Judges are not bound by the decisions of old Judges. New Judges
>    may, however, settle only those questions on which the players currently
>    disagree and that affect the completion of the turn in which Judgment
>    was invoked. All decisions by Judges shall be in accordance with all 
>    the rules then in effect; but when the rules are silent, inconsistent, 
>    or unclear on the point at issue, then the Judge shall consider
>    game-custom and the spirit of the game before applying other standards.

[This is his latest published version, from his web page. I have reason
to believe that this paragraph was not included in the original publication
in Metamagical Themas. Could someone with a copy check this?]

I'll leave it up to someone else to do an analysis for what "game custom"
means in each of these cases, why we have it, and whether we should keep
it, but before I finish I'll just add that there is obviously a strong
game custom towards using game custom. And that's a good enough reason
for me. :)
