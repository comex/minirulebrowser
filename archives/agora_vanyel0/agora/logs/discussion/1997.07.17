"A 'Nomic Entity' is an individual entity belonging to an Entity Class.  In
 general, a Nomic Entity has no discernible existence without the Rules,
 only existing by virtue of the Rules defining it to exist.  A Nomic Entity
 with a discernible existence without the Rules (e.g. Players; any body of
 text with a special Agoran significance) is 'destroyed' by losing all Nomic
 Properties it possesses, including and especially membership in any Entity
 Classes."

"No Nomic Entity may have the same name as an Entity Class, unless it is
 an instance of that Entity Class."

You can't - the Misanthropists' Group is the only Entity which is
authorized to create Transfer Orders. You _might_ have better luck
ordering the transfer of 1 VT from yourself to the EE, or just
plain transferring it.

You can even less order the creation of a TO - of _whatever_ kind, this
time. You can't call for the creation of a Currency TO because you're
not the Mintor of that Currency, and you can't "order" the creation
a non-Currency TO because that is a voluntary action (well, assuming
that there is in fact no identity of Currency and non-Currency TOs).

That should be fine... although Rule 1598 will probably require that
you preface this with "H. Assessor, please record etc.". As stated
above, your transfer attempt may not be, if we interpret Rule 1598
literally, a valid Transfer Order. It might be argued that you are
implicitly requiring the appropriate RK to note the transfer, but
to be on the safe side one should not omit the formality.

Ah. You appear to be using the verb 'name' more narrowly than I was.
My thought was that when I say "I transfer a kudo", I say something
which implies that the entity I'm transferring has a name. Evidently
you deny this. I don't know who has the right of it.

'Name' is ambiguous, apparently. It's another type/token ambiguity, I
think. Imagine an African immigrant arriving in Australia for the first
time and visiting Melbourne Zoo. Seeing a platypus for the first time,
she turns to a zookeeper and asks: "what is the name of that creature?"

Scenario 1: the zookeeper turns to her and says: "that one is called Thomas".
Scenario 2: the zookeeper turns to her and says: "that one is called
a platypus".

Both seem permissible uses to me.

No. Powers were a Currency, but individual Power Cards were not units
of more than one Currency.

But speaking of Powers, you have said nothing of the precedent which
the divergent uses of the word 'Power' in the Ruleset seems to set.
We never had any trouble distinguishing the Power of Rules from the
Power of Influence. Why should we now have any trouble distinguishing
the execution of Transfer Orders from the minting of 'Transfer Orders'?

I don't believe that individual Kudos have names; when you say that
you transfer a Kudo, you are actually underspecifying which Kudo you
intend to transfer, but it's irrelevant because Kudos, like (most)
Currencies, are fungible.

In Scenario 1 the zookeeper gave the instance name; in Scenario 2 the
zookeeper gave the class name.  With regards to Rule 1586, I believe
it's absurd to apply this to mean that no two entities may have the
same class name; this would require that every entity be of a class
distinct from every other entity, which certainly does not appear to
be the case, and probably conflicts with some lower-numbered Rules
(such as Rule 1062, which appears to create a class of entities known
as Kudos, for example).  In my opinion, the only reasonable
construction of "Name" in Rule 1586 is as "instance name".

It is also quite clear to me that not every entity has an instance
name.  My car doesn't.  If you asked me the name of my car, I'd tell
you quite readily that it doesn't have one.  It's a Toyota Tercel, but
I don't consider that its name.  And, again, to return to Rule 1586, I
believe this Rule is silent with respect to such nameless entities.  I
do not believe that two nameless entities have the same name, since
neither has any name.

I'm still trying to come up with a good text for the definition of Nomic
Entity. Your "discernable existence" may help. 

      A Nomic Entity is an individual entity which has no discernable 
      existence without the Rules. 

would probably do the trick. The problem with making all Nomic Entities
belong to an Entity Class is that (a) unique entities like the Virus still
need their own class, and (b) Entity Classes themselves are Nomic Entities,
which would lead to an uncomfortable infinite recursion effect. The bit
about non-Nomic entities being "destroyed" by losing all Nomic Properties
is good, but it might belong in a different Rule.

Wry amusement here. Crito's and Murphy's difficulties with the correct
formulations for effecting transfers leads me to believe that, in the
minds of some Players at least, Transfer Orders have been conflated
with Currency-like entities ("I hereby create a Transfer Order...").
You'd have to believe that two _very_ similar types of things, who
are referred to by the same name, are in fact the same thing.

But actually, as I think someone has already commented upon, weren't
Powers adopted well after Powers were repealed ?

Actually, I used the formulation "I hereby submit a Transfer Order...".  This
is not a conflation with Currency-like entities, it just bypasses the shorthand
formulation allowed by pre-defined game custom for transferring currencies.

According to PC, you have to submit a Transfer Order to the proper Recordkeeper
before currency is actually transferred.  We agreed ahead of time that
statements of the type "I hereby transfer ..." are equivalent to a Transfer
Order.

I don't think of a Transfer Order as a Currency-like entity.  I think of it
as a "document" I have to send in order to have Currencies that I possess
transferred.  I have to agree with Steve on this point.  The checks I write
(Transfer Orders to my bank) and the dollar bills that I carry in my wallet are
not in fact the same thing, even though I tend to refer to both of them as
"money".

If this is the case, it is probably because more so because of your
impassioned advocacy than because of any rationally-held belief.

Yes, and I believe my usage is supported (at least in part) by
the judgement of CFJ 803.  In his arguments, Judge Michael
opined that "known as" was not synonymous with "named."
In a similar vein, I would argue that "called" (cf. R1062)
is not synonymous with "named".

Hmmm... Yes. I made a wrong interpretation based on Rule 108, but that
one only provides a lower limit. The Rule that gives the actual timing
is Rule 376, and that one indeed does say what you claim.

By the way, the duty to admit the error and make a correct report is
yourself, ironically... (at least, if you are Speaker as I think you
are)

I'm seeking people's opinions on the interaction of R947 and
P3533--specifically, what exactly is my duty here, if anything?

At the time P3533 was adopted, 947/10 was in effect:

      If there are more than 100 Rules, and a Proposal is adopted
      which, as part or all of its effect, repeals one or more Rules,
      that Proposal's Proposer shall receive 3 P-Notes.  This transfer
      shall be reported by the Rulekeepor, who shall do so as soon as
      possible after the Proposal's Adoption.

However, I did not report this before P3533 took effect, and when
it did, 947/11 took effect:

      If a Proposal is adopted which, as part of all of its effect,
      repeals one or more Rules, and, immediately prior to the
      adoption of this Proposal there were more than 100 Rules, the
      Rulekeepor shall pay out 3 P-Notes to the Proposer of that
      Proposal.

Does 947/11 now require me to pay out 3 P-Notes for the
adoption of P3533?  947/11 was not in effect when P3533
was adopted.

I will note that, as Assessor, I will accept just anything that

Here's my opinion (even though my opinions don't carry much weight 8).

I think an obligation placed on a Player by the Rules can be considered a Nomic
Entity and therefore there is continuity between the obligation placed on you
by 947/10 and 947/11.

If an obligation is *not* considered a Nomic Entity, then I don't think the
947/10 obligation disappeared when 947/11 took effect, so you are still
required to report the transfer ASAP.  What effect would this have? 
Apparently, the PC proposal has established an equivalency between Rule
mandated transfers reported by Players and Rule mandated pay-outs by Players.

So I would think, in either case, you still have to transfer the 3 P-notes
awarded by R947.

I have to disagree here--Rule 101 says we must follow the rules
currently in effect.  947/10 is not currently in effect, so
I am fairly confident that I am not required to simply report
the transfer of 3 P-Notes.  What I'm not clear on is whether
I have an obligation to report a Payment Order, or whether I
have no obligation at all in this respect.

Hmm.  Yes, I think you are right here.

I do think that the PC proposal maintained continuity between the obligation
imposed by 947/10 and 947/11 so that you are required to report the Payment
Order.

I doubt the advocacy had anything to do with it, and I'm slightly
displeased with your characterizing it as impassioned; the issues
are interesting and that's why I wanted to discuss them. I'll readily
admit that my creating similarly named Currencies was possibly
the cause of any confusion arising, but that was the point, wasn't
it ?

I think the transfer occured, but Chuck may be absolved of reporting
it.  This has happened before.

My take is that the transfer occured, but you have no obligation to
report it.  (The Recordkeepor does have an obligation to record it,
however.)  There is no obligation to execute a Payment Order because
the Rule regarding Payment Orders was not in force at that time.

It would be courteous of you to inform the Recordkeepor of the
transfer, however.

Ah, that does seem likely.  I don't know why I didn't think of that
interpretation myself.  I think this is the interpretation I'll
use, unless there is a strong argument for some other intpretation.

The Payment Order that 947/11 would have required em to issue had it been in
effect.  But I think you are right.  In this case the transfer does take place
at the passage of the proposal - not at the time of it's being reported as I
originally thought.

If elected Wizard, I promise to do whatever I can to reward conciseness
and clarity in proposals. I will favour those who attempt to add interesting
new concepts to the game, without creating needless complexity; and those
who can turn the hopelessly convoluted passages of our rules into simplicity
and light. I will judge all proposals impartially, without reference to 
other political associations.

Sounds cool.

If elected Wizard, I promise to do whatever I can to penalize excess
consistency and legalist nit-picking in Proposals; I will favor those who
attempt to add interesting new Scams to Agora's convoluted history and create
needless complexity; and those who can turn the few boring areas of the Rules
that remain into something as obfuscated at the rest. I will judge all
Proposals on the sole merit of their Silliness, to the exclusion of all other
criteria. :)
