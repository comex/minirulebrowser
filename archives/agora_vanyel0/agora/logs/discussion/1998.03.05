An enormously impressive achievement, Scott. I have just a few comments:

I think this ought to be 3 weeks. Given that we have 10 day Voting
Period, suspension of Voting Privileges for 2 weeks is only going
to deny an Entity the chance to vote on Proposals that are distributed
in the first 4 days of the suspension. The other way to do this would be
suspend the privilege with respect to any Proposal distributed during
the 2 week period, even if its VP ends after the 2 week period is over.
You might also consider cancelling any votes already cast by the
suspended Player on Proposals whose VPs end during the suspension.
But simply making it a three week period is probably simplest.

Can you explain how this works, exactly? If I believe that an
Annotation that's long been in the Ruleset is now no longer
pertinent, what do I do?

Not any more. 'Speaker Transition Reform' repealed Rule 942.

Proto-Proposal
Indelible Proposal voting

[Comment: indelible voting has a number of advantages: it's legislatively
simpler (no need to worry about retracted or changed votes), it
encourages VT spending since Players can't retract votes in excess
of those needed to achieve the result they desire, and it provides a
negotiation-friendly environment, since Players can publically keep
promises and/or signal that they are not available to be negotiated
with by voting.]

Be it therefore resolved that R683 have its Title changed to
"Voting on Proposals" and that it be amended to read:

      A Voting Entity votes upon a Proposal when, during the Voting
      Period of that Proposal, e informs the Assessor of the vote or
      votes e is casting upon that Proposal, provided that e is
      authorized to cast those votes on that Proposal. Once cast, a
      vote cannot be changed or cancelled by the Voting Entity which
      cast it, although it may be cancelled as other Rules require.

      A vote upon a Proposal must be one of FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN
      (or an obvious synonym of one of these).  Something which is not
      one of these is not a vote upon a Proposal.

      A vote cast by a Voting Entity which does not have an Executor
      is cast at a time and in a manner specified in other Rules.

      This Rule in no way authorizes any entity to cast votes upon
      Proposals.

Be it further resolved that Rule 1442 have its Title changed to
"The Cost of Voting" and that it be amended to read:

      As soon as possible after the end of the Voting Period of a
      given Proposal, the Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity a
      number of Voting Tokens equal to the votes cast on that
      Proposal by that entity.

[Comment: together these amendments also eliminate some overlap between
the current versions of these Rules.]

Maybe, but it also allows easier and neater formatting of replies.

Although you could work out a deal with the Rebels. As has been
noted, if enough of use become Abiding by then the Revolt won't occur
and you can keep your hard-won Offices. Of course, the Threat would
have to offer something in exchange. ;)

If made at the time of Rebellion, this apology, or one like it that
didn't try to claim that dumping work on me for the sake of a win was
justified, would have probably eased my feelings somewhat, and
probably saved you a Kudo.  As it was, I felt that I was having my
position abused by the Threat for their own nefarious ends, and lo, I
was.

By way of contrast, when Ronald Kunne and I scammed the rules for
winning by judging things quickly, he was CotC and knew of all the
work that was going to descend upon him.

Would it also have saved the further one you transferred from him, for
"grumbling"?

Hardly.  That was for him grumbling about Kolja A.'s post (to the
extent, recall, that Kolja lost a Kudo for it).

That a group calling itself the Threat should be surprised to
occasionally find itself on the receiving end of a bit of hostile
rhetoric is in itself a bit surprising.  Perhaps people find you
threatening? 

And recall that not everyone here knows the history of how the name
came about.  (I thought then, and still do, that it was a particularly
nice response to KoJen's own rhetoric.)

Michael.

Was the Speaker-ship relevant?  Before the revolt, Blob was out of
Office, but it's not as if the Speaker gets an Officer's Vote.  One
way or another you were going to have to see Blob fight an election.
Wouldn't it have been easier to have General Chaos resign as Wizard,
appointing Blob to that post, and then after winning that election
(hopefully), you would be in position to spring the proposal on us.

Yes: the Speaker can call elections, blocking the Officer's Vote.

We had originally hoped to do this with just 3 Officers, and one Proposer
(Blob), plus bribes.  Swann's addition came about as is outlined in the
Scam proposal.


You'll understand that I'm a bit hesitant to discuss our strategy any more
deeply until after the scam is over.

It may not have Officerdom in a stranglehold, but it's got it in a pretty good
headlock.  8)

Ah yes. I was thinking that having the Speakership might give you some
ability; however, in this case, it is important to control it to
prevent somebody else using it.

Can I just point out that R1036 says that the Proposal Queue should be
sorted in order of descending Priority, and not by Proposal Number? These
Rules are about to be amended though, and I don't what the new arrangements
might be.

You're right. I've only just realised what a bother that is, for little
benefit. I think we ought to change it. I'm not sure what the new 
arrangements are.

Sigh. We seem to have lost Vanyel. I'll wait a while and see if this

Still, there wasn't a lot we could do about it. Explaining to you
at the time why we had triggered the Revolt would have been disastrous
for the scam. But also, I think you have to admit that conducting 15
Elections, or whatever number it is, is not on the same scale as
distributing hundreds of CFJs, something I also would not have
done without consulting the affected Officer. The Assessor has often
in the past had to tally votes on 15 Proposals at once, or even more,
(my first batch, back when the Speaker still tallied votes, in
September 1994, was 23 Proposals!), and no-one has ever claimed that
this was unreasonable, or that the Assessor should be warned in
advance of this, and so on. And as I say, no-one warned me when I
was Registrar of an impending Revolt. When I pointed that out to
you, your reply was to say, pretty much, that the Revolt was a
pointless and grubby little exercise to install a Threat clique in
power, and to transfer a second Kudo from me. Now, that may have been
an understandable conclusion for you to draw in the circumstances,
but it nevertheless was a false one, and a pretty offensive one at
that, since it implies that the members of the Threat, and myself in
particular (since you referred to us derisively as "Steve and his
little cohorts") are motivated solely by desires of the cheapest sort
for power for its own sake, an accusation I vehemently deny. Can you
understand why I find that characterization of my motives upsetting?

Sigh. It seems I might as well demonstrate the other reason why it
was crucial to the scam that a Threat be the Speaker.

I hereby declare Proposal 3710 to be a Senate Proposal.

It doesn't? What about:

Rule 1486/3 (Power=1)
Procedure to Impeach An Officer

      ...

      The Referendum must list both the Office and the Player holding
      this Office by name. If upon passage of the Referendum the named
      Player is holding the named Office, then that Player is
      immediately removed from that Office.

Currently, the largest source of VT input is Officer Salaries. This 
would change that to VTs, paid monthly instead of weekly. VTs would 
be available through ten Birthrights, which produce 0.5 VTs per week, 
and through alternate methods (such as proposals, internomic 
proposals, Winning the Game, etc).

The justification for changing Officers' rewards to P-Notes is 
twofold: first, the officers are also the players who tend to submit 
the most Proposals; and second, the current state of affairs gives 
Officers far too much power.

ProtoProposal: Birthrights

Let Rule 1007 (Salaries of Officers) be amended to read:

      At the beginning of each month, the Registrar shall pay out
      to each Officer the designated Salary for each Office that
      Officer has held without interruption for the entire five days
      preceding.

      There shall be a Basic Officer Salary, which is equal to 1 
      P-Note. Salaries are permitted to be expressed in terms of the 
      Basic Salary. Salaries expressed in half units shall be rounded 
      up every even numbered month, and rounded down every odd 
      numbered month.  Unless otherwise specified, the Salary for an 
      Office shall be equal to the Basic Officer Salary. 

Let a rule entitled 'Birthrights' with Power=1 be enacted, reading:

	  Birthrights are a currency. The MUQ of Birthrights is 1. The 
      Recordkeepor for Birthrights is the Accountor. The Mintor of 
      VTs is the Bank.

      Birthrights may not be either minted or destroyed except by a 
      provision in the text of a passed Proposal.

      Whenever any entity other than a Player possesses a Birthright, 
      the Accountor is authorized and required to submit a Payment 
      Order for one Birthright from that entity to a randomly 
      selected Player.

      A Noble Player is a Player with at least one Birthright.

Let 10 Birthrights be minted and placed in the Bank.

Let a rule entitled 'Payment from Birthrights' with Power=1 be 
enacted, reading:

      At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Accountor shall pay 
      out 0.5 VTs to each Noble Player who has not recieved any 
      Blots during the preceding Nomic Week.

Just to clarify the effects of this: firstly, Group votes by the
Threat and the Order of the Evil Eye are cancelled. Secondly,
the votes of Sherlock and Time Agent are cancelled, as they will
not become Senators until March 16. Thirdly, Antimatter will not be
permitted to vote. Cf Rule 1717.

I tend to thing of 'a month later' than today (for example) as being 
N days after today, where N is the number of days in the current 
month.

I think it's too early to be claiming that. Ignoring the Officer's
Veto scam, which is an anomaly which will soon be corrected one
way or another, what you have left to support the claim that Officers
are excessively powerful in the current system is that being an
Officer is the predominant way of earning VTs. Now, in the first place,
the current system (VT scarcity, limited VT supply, Salaries in VTs)
has only been in place for a very short time, and so I think it's too
early to be drawing conclusions, and certainly too early to be thinking
about moving to a completely different system entirely. Personally,
I want to explore the possibilities of this one for a good while longer
yet.

But in the second place, insofar as the effects of the current system
are discernible at this early stage, those effects appear to have
been good ones. We've just witnessed the most interesting and
closely fought set of Elections ever held in the game, a fact which I
think is directly attributable to the desirability of holding Office
in the new system. Since Officers perform the functions that keep the
game running, it is entirely appropriate that they be rewarded by
granting them privileges which make holding Office desirable. This
ensures that Players are motivated to discharge their Official duties
well.

Call me paranoid, but I am extremely suspicious of anyone who scams 
for a Power=4 instrument and 10 VTs, regardless of declared 
intentions, even if it *does* close a loophole. Also, since a Revolt 
is imminent anyways, I don't see it making much of a difference. 
Finally, if the Speaker can use eir powers to pursue a scam, lesser 
players can use their powers to respond, yes?

They will have an effect if they are adopted. The idea that they will
not was a mistake initiated, I think, by Murphy in his ADJ, and
unfortunately spread by me. From R1486:

      The Referendum must list both the Office and the Player holding
      this Office by name. If upon passage of the Referendum the named
      Player is holding the named Office, then that Player is
      immediately removed from that Office.

It's not so much for the benefit of seeing a representation
of it, as it is for the actual operation of it.  R1770
says that if there are more than 5 Proposals in the Queue
in a given week with Priority>0, those 5 which occur
first in the queue are distributed.

Maybe a specific exemption saying that the order in which
the Proposals appear in the Promotor's representation of
the Queue need not be the same order they actually
occur in the Queue?

You're right, of course.  I'm still not voting or declaring
presence on them for the time being.  I am interested in
hearing any arguments why I should vote one way or the other.

Possibly. However, I think that being able to outspend everyone else 
due to VT income qualifies.

It's not a completely different system - the proto would make a total 
of three short rule changes; hardly enough to overhaul the system. It 
would just change the inputs, it wouldn't effect scarcity much.

Hmm. Why don't I believe you're unbiased? :-)

Having the most signifigant source of P-Notes would also be 
desirable, especially if a P-Note RGB provision were added to the 
proto. Does anyone support that?

I agree totaly; I'm not proposing to eliminate salaries, only change 
them to a less unbalancing form. Granted, I'm also proposing to then 
unbalance the game differently.

I don't believe that the current level of reward is neccessary to 
encourage Officers to do their jobs well.
