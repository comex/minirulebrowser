The latest one is at

(whenever I update it).  There is a link to this document from my Nomic page.

Also, back issues are available at URLs such as

for the 20 Feb 98 issue.  I have no links to these (yet), but they exist.

Severely doubtful. It was balanced to give a slight excess, given a 
few assumptions about the number of proposals etc. made, and several 
methods of draining the excess were added (Churches, switching Plot 
types, and the diversity penalty). Although the numbers have been a 
bit fiddled (it's gotten easier to get several Plots quickly), I 
believe that the Proposal Queue will act as another mechanism to 
drain any excess wealth.

I may, however, oppose any changes from recent versions (I haven't 
read the lastest ones thoroughly) that would make Plots or Mules 
easier to get. Of course, I haven't seen that happening (mabie I need 
to look closer :-)

I'd appreciate someone doing a numerical analysis for the latest 
version of Plots: maximum average production assuming everything is 
placed at maximum efficiency, no player has more than one type of 
Mule, no Churches, and no Mules being switched around of P-Notes and 
VTs per player, and a reasonable guess assuming a low but plausible 
amount of spillage.

Regarding Plots v3.1:

1) How is this supposed to "get moving"? Each player can buy three Plots --
if they intend to sink their entire "starting package" into doing so. Is
this your intention?

2) There are three outdated amendments: To R1763 (Inadvertant Transfers
II), R1753 (Repeal-O-Matic), and R1702 (Petition Fees.) 

3) Right now, Maintenance Fees are paid by month, while Production is
weekly. It's a bit confusing...

4) Make sure you plug the "Inadvertant Transfers" loophole before this gets
passed -- as written, it's still wide open.

Okay. If we assume that no player uses Indulgences to purchase Plots, each
player has enough currency at the adoption of Plots v3.1 to purchase 3
Plots. Given optimal placing (i.e., checkerboard pattern of Houses and
Farms), a Player who made all three into the same type of structure could
expect to generate 9 P-Notes or 9 VTs per week. They'll require only 3 Ergs
per month as upkeep -- easily purchasable from a player who specializes in
Mines (e'd produce 3 Ergs per week, and require only 3 per month for eir
own upkeep, giving em 9 per month to sell -- enough to keep up three oher
Players' plots.) 

And remember, with such a large income of P-Notes, a Player could easily
purchase a large number of additional Plots, allowing em to get enough
Mines to be self-supporting.

     Hey, I was trying to catch up on reading my back issues of
Analog magazine, when I came across a letter to the editor from Scott
Goehring in the Nov. '97 issue.
     Turns out, Agorans are just as outspoken in the real world...

Heh, indeed, that was me.  I'm surprised nobody else has noticed it
before.  I'm kinda surprised they printed it (and, of course, by the
time it was printed, the comments were out of date).

It _is_ a terrible pun, but is it "truly hideous" ? This is possibly 
going to give us an occasion to settle something that's had me 
wondering ever since the Silly Rules were enacted - in the case of a 
dispute over what "a truly hideous pun" or "a joke" is, are the 
Courts competent to make a decision, and if so, what criteria should 
they adopt ? The case of limericks and rhymed poems is, after all, 
much more straightforward - there are definite constraints of form.

I think you should send that to a-b rather than a-o for a clearer
distinction between Proposal Queue postings and official Proposal
distributions. I actually started sending in my Votes...

Well, I thought, since it was an official publication (i.e., required by the
Rules), a-o was more appropriate.  NBut I'll be glad to send it to a-b if that
fits better with Players' sort routines.

Oh, right. I thought its publication was discretionary, but you are
correct; it is Rule-mandated. Of course that is just a rule of thumb
as far as the distinction between a-o and a-b goes. I don't know
what others think, but the reason I raised the issue was that I tend
to send in my Votes whenever I see new Proposals distributed, and
the Proposal Queue publication triggered a kind of knee-jerk reflex -
see Proposals, send Votes.

I'm afraid the question will be mooted; the Silly Rules will be
repealed as soon as I report Voting Results.

I take the opposite tack. I think it's pretty clearly truly hideous,
but I worry about whether it's a really a pun, or actually a distinct
species of wordplay, eg a spoonerism.

He's required to send it, so as far as I'm concerned, it belongs on
the Official list.

Not necessarily; as you pointed out, the Silly Rules were still
in force when Crito sent in his Proposal. In particular, I think 
that if you waited until after then end of this week to report
the results, then I think the question of whether Crito satisfied
the requirements of the Silliness Rules would be actionable. Not
that I'm suggesting you do this...

Hm, yes, there is that.  I was more thinking about the reward for
successful Silliness.

It is both a pun *and* a spoonerism. "Writ of FAGE" is a pun for "rit of Fage".
