I would be willing to be the Contestmaster for Contests of Prediction;
I suspect my other duties might prevent me from being a Contestant.

Newbie ramblings - an introduction

I am a new player (and one without any earlier Nomic experience, apart
from reading the Agora mailing logs kept by Vanyel/Don Blaheta for a
few weeks), and I would like to shortly introduce myself and make a
few remarks about things you were discussing in the last few weeks. 


I. Personal stuff

I am  PhD student in theoretical/computational physics at the Ruhr
University in Bochum, Germany. I waste a lot of time surfing the
Internet (that's also how I came across the idea of Nomics, including
Agora). So I guess if you want to know more about me you could try
a look at my Web-Profile, maybe checking out some of my bookmarks
(they are not meant to be used like that, but feel free...):
<http://www.tp3.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/~klaush/Welcome.html>

But now let's get to business :) The Agora issues I am interested in
most are economics and foreign relations, so here are some ramblings
concerning these points.


II. Economics

In a game economics (most importantly the existence of scarce
resources that are somehow required to play) can exist for two
reasons: as a simulation which is fun in its own right, and as a way
to create some pressure on decisions players have to make. 

I think that in a Nomic the latter aspect should be most important -
simulations are much easier to do in a computerized context (sorry if
my job comes through here :). Now I'd rather not say anything against
those of you who have put a lot of effort into preparing more aspects
of an aconomy within Agora (in some recent protos, like those on
resources, plots, production, etc, but also concerning the Agoraverse
as a "virtual space" where these economics can happen). But somehow I
have a feeling that many efforts in that direction could be seen as an
attempt to create something MUD-like within a Nomic - of course with
the advantage over MUDs that everything can be changed, because there
are no hardware or code based restrictions. But with the huge
disadvantage that every single small transaction has to be done by
hand by real humans. The pragmatic currencies proposal and the
discussions around it show how much repetitive and boring work is
involved even at a rather elementary level. Do we really want to
reinvent the MUD concept and run one by hand?

On the other hand, I think that some pressure on the political
decision making (which certainly is a focus of a Nomic game) could be
produced in much simpler ways using the structures that already
exist. Ignoring the technical problems around "Restore Game Balance"
there is such a huge number of VTs and P-notes around that I would
really like to ask you (this is an honest question, not a rhetorical
one, so I'd appreciate getting some answers!): did you ever feel that
you did not have enough VTs or P-notes to do things you wanted to do?
I don't mean just the general habit of being present instead of
voting on not-so-hot issues - did you ever face a "tough" decision
whether to use a VT or P-note or not? Or is one of the lessons to
learn here (and a very interesting one it would be!) that in a
democracy it is very hard to adopt proposals that make life harder for
everyone? 

What would you think about making the VTs a more scarce currency, like
for example (rough sketch, not even protoproposal level, just to give
you the idea):

Limit the overall number of VTs to five times the number of players
(ouch - but that's the point!). If the bank is required to give out
VTs it doesn't have (by Rule 1684 or whatever else) it collects a tax
from all players, either a flat tax (everyone pays 1 Nth of the
required amount, where N is the number of active players) or a
percentage of the VTs in eir treasury. 

This would make spending VTs harder, non-voting penalties harsher etc
- you must admit that even after a balance restore transfers of 0.5 VTs
don't really make a difference if you have 20 of them to vote on five
proposals a week.

But it would not create more red tape, manual work etc, at least not
as much as the bookkeeping for plots, production etc. 


III. Foreign policy and Diplomacy

One of the things I enjoyed reading were the discussions about
internomic relations, wars, diplomacy, high treason etc, because these
are new areas of "game space". At the same time many socail and
political phenomena come up here: moral, ethics and politics; loyalty,
patriotism etc; communication and conflict solving between different
groups with different custums and cultures... This sounds like fun!

I was a bit surprized, though, how seriously some of you seemed to
take all these things - both Morendil and his critics (see below). I
would like to point out that, viweing the whole thing as "just" a
game, all the contributions and actions were highly interesting and
also connected with similar things in the real world - including
conflicts between patriotism and pacifism, differing opinions about
the "proper" means (and goals) for resolving conflicts, etc.

In my opinion Morendils actions not only triggered a series of highly
stimulating discussions, as well as new developments in the field of
diplomacy (including all the subsequent Internomic proposals). The
existence of "dissenters", "pacifists" or even "traitors" is also an
integral part of the politics of conflict - let's play that out and
enjoy it!


IV. Playing style

Which leads me to the mst difficult question I faced for my own style
of playing Agora, especially in respect to the "war" issue. Extreme
approaches to this would be either to behave just as I would in the
real world (where I am a Christian trying to ive according to the ten
commandments, and where I am trying hard to be honest and open,
because I don't like talking behind others' backs etc. pp.), or on the
other hand a kind of "it's just a game, innit?", roleplaying approach
- in games I can enjoy backstabbing former partners, using lies and
deception, and even play out killing others as long as that lies
within the rules of the game (yes, I like Cosims, ASL anyone?). That's
because in games I'm not dealing with real people but with cardboard
counters, or at least with other gamers who voluntarily agreed to play
the same game I play, according to the same rules (which may or may
not allow lying, killing and other acts that are immoral in the real
world) - nobody really dies or gets hurt, and the worst thing that can
happen is losing a game.

I think in Agora I'll have to choose a middle way - I'll try to be
myself as far as manners and procedures are concerned, but I will
behave just as if I was playing any other _game_ face to face, so
things that are allowed within the rules, including warfare (and
treason!) are ok as long as they contribute to the general enjoyment
of the game and don't completely spoil the game for others.


Well, I'll leave it at that for a start ... I guess you won't be
seeing another post this long from me anytime soon - I'll be glad if I
can just keep up with the everyday "duties" of playing along without
collecting too many blots and the like. Please let me know what you
think about these things, especially about the economics thing - if
some of you think it's feasible I'd like to try and turn the ideas
about scarce VTs into a proposal some time.

Thanks for reading and for all the friendly "Welcome"-mails!

Disclaimer: I apologize for any style problems (Spi.. Whatsisname, a
yes, Spivak, I think, pronouns, which are new to me; repeating
arguments you have already had ad nauseam, etc) - if you noticed any
please let me know so I can do better next time. Thanks!

No, I have never faced a really *tough* decision about using VTs or P-notes
based on available supply (even before my VT windfall).  I *have* faced
interesting decisions about whether or not to vote on a proposal for tactical
reasons, which is one of the things that keeps the game fun even without a
complex economy.  And yes, I think in a true democracy such as Agora, it *is*
very hard to adopt proposals that make life harder for everyone.  It's even
hard to adopt proposals that make life (significantly) harder for one Player,
such as an Officer.

I'm not against making VTs really scarce, per se.  However, I think most of us
tend to be very wary of the possibility that it might become impossible for a
Player to vote at all (or make proposals, although some Players are content to
play without proposing).  The discussions generate a great deal (if not most)
of the fun here, of course, but voting and making proposals are the two
fundamental moves of the game - running the risk of preventing Players from
making these moves for extended periods of time is probably *not* a Good Thing.

Hear! Hear!  But sometimes it *is* hard not to get so caught up in things that
we take it too seriously (or sometimes too personally).  Beware of causing
narcissistic injuries! (That's what Rishonomic did to Agora when they called us
"boring".) 8)  Morendil's actions *did* cause a lot of interesting events and e
took a lot of criticism for it.  I'm glad e seems to have taken it in stride
and I hope we continue to get out of these little spats without any blood on
the floor.  8)

Excellent choice. 8)

P.S.  I've gotten used to this spivak pronoun stuff in a way, but I still find
myself mentally translating them whenever I read them (kind of a pain). 
Personally, I think using third person plural to refer to singular persons of
indeterminate sex is perfectly fine in English.  After all we have the
precedent of using the plural form to refer to both singular and plural in the
second person.

Interesting concept.  Note that our present concept of currencies
effectively makes the Bank bottomless, because the Bank can go
indefinitely negative without substantial consequence.  (This is
untrue under the system I propose in the Pragmatic Currencies Proposal
recently Promoted, by the way; your suggestion is more relevant under
that conceptualization.)

I want to repeal the non-voting penalty.  I also want to repeal the
general stipend.  The second is a poor effort to rectify the
unbalancing affect of the first.  There has to be a better way.

I'm willing to accept a reasonable amount of bookkeeping if it makes
the game more interesting.

Thanks for pointing it out!  Although the amendment is also
not unattributed, as I reported.

He receives 2 P-Notes for F-A, reported by the Assessor (R833).  He
receives 3 P-Notes for the Bonus for Repeal, reported by the
Rulekeepor (R947).

Of course that is a crucial point, and I would certainly not want to
make it impossible to vote (or propose things). But I think it could
be solved within the general framework of very scarce VTs, with 
appropriate finetuning of the taxation system (like a minimum income
and/or amount of VTs in each player's treasury that can not be touched
by the tax collector). 

In Germany income tax works like that: not only the gross amount of
tax you pay depends on your gross income, but the _percentage_ of your
gross income that is your tax varies with income, as well: from zero -
no income tax at all - for people with very low income (like me :) to
a top tax rate of 50% or so.

So your point is definitly valid (and as a new player without any
regular source of Agora currencies from salaries etc I am certainly
very much concerned by this), but solving it would be part of the fun
of introducing taxation.

Strangely enough, that's also (roughly) how the income tax works in the

Harlequin,

I keep forgetting to ask.  What is the definition
of a single move in Tag?  A move to one adjacent
position or a single message stating a move to a
(possibly) more distant location?

Regards,

I believe the US uses something like

  tax = P1% of your income below $L1
      + P2% of your income between $L1 and $L2
      + P3% of your income between $L2 and $L3, etc.

IOW, say P1=10, P2=20, P3=10, L1=10000, L2=20000, L3=30000:
  income $7000 -> tax $700
  income $12000 -> tax $1000 + $400 = $1400
  income $24000 -> tax $1000 + $2000 + $800 = $2800

Heck, with all these people joing the Democratic Movement, I'm going to 
have to create the Undemocratic Movement. Democracy is all very good for
the real world, but in a game it is boring! Bring on dynamic power shifts
and cunning political manoevres (sp?), I say!

I started this recent economic push, and I did it for a bit of both of
these reasons. I want to simulate a meaningful economy, not just the 
passing around of arbitrary tokens. This will only happen when the
economy can effect the things that we value - ie our power to direct
the game. 

The is why I have supported the creation of the VT and P-Note currency
as they are not just meaningless tokens, but are a direct measure of 
a player's power to change things. At the moment the market is flooded
with both. I am keen to bring about some scarcity.

However, scarcity when it is evenly distributed is boring. What I aim 
to do is to arrange things so that some players have a lot of one 
currency, but lack another. This will create a need for players to trade
and interact with one another in order achieve their ends. In short, I
aim to produce more wheeling and dealing.

I think things have rather got out of hand, and are getting far too 
complex. I am inclined to go back to my original Jobs & Wages ideas, 
get it running, and then make it more complex as time goes on.

Indeed, no.

No. The main restriction I have felt is the inability to spend the VTs
I do have.

Yes. Tell me about it. How long will it take to convince these people that
democracy is boring! (Of course, where would I be without them? The game
would also be boring if I did not have an enemy to fight! The next best 
thing to a good friend is a noble enemy.)

I would prefer, as I stated above, to coordinate the scarcity of VTs 
and P-Notes (and other valuable commodities) so that a player had surplus
of one and little of the other.

I agree that Morendil's move was a good one, even if it opposed my aims
(vis "noble enemy" above), but I do feel that e went a bit far with the 
rhetoric. This is a difficult line to draw. Partly you want to get into
the feel of the game and argue your position strongly, but you also have
to keep in mind that it is only a game, and you don't want to really 
offend the other players. 

This is a very interesting issue, and one I have never really got to the
heart of. How do you keep a game being fun? Too little competition and the
game becomes boring, too much and people's feelings can become hurt. Their
must be some way to strike a happy medium.

I, too, am a Christian and I feel very much the same way. I love playing
games with scheming and intrigue, and yet such behaviour is anathema to me
in real life.

I commend your attitude. I hope we can work together. Or else, play
hard against each other. It would be a privileged to be betrayed by one
such as you. :)

Blob does not see what the difficulty is. E has been a Spivak for years.
E would refer to emself in any other way. E hopes you get the hang of them

That's no surprise. The Threat is kind of an Undemocratic Movement already.
Ironically, in spite of the extra push it would give to their ideals, the 
Democratic Movement cannot become a Group, as that would rather be 
betraying their goal, would it not? :)

A maxim from Diplomacy seems appropriate here: "One enemy is
good.  No enemies is bad."

Another part of the problem is that people have different tolerances,
if you will, for what will offend them.  To draw an analogy
to Diplomacy (can you tell what I've been doing a lot of lately?)
some people tend to take the betrayal and stabs in Diplomacy
too personally.  For Diplomacy, it's easy enough to say that
those people probably should just find a game more suited to
them, but somehow it seems that nomic should be more egalitarian.
