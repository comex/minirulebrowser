Proto: Simplify Currency Handling v 2

Good catch.  Here is an amended version that makes newly minted official
currency units start out in the Bank.  BTW, is there an "approved" format for
claiming precedence in cases like this?

=================
Amend Rule 1661 by replacing the text "order the award of" with "pay out" and
by replacing all occurrences of "Payment Order" with "Transfer Order".

Amend Rule 1721/0 by appending the sentence "The Chancellor has Mint
Authority."

[I'm not sure this is really necessary, except that it may ensure the
continuity of Mint Authority for Currencies across Chancellor transitions and
avoid claims that all Currencies have been destroyed.  Better safe than sorry. 
Anybody think we need other changes to prevent Currency destruction when the
Chancellorship changes hands?]

Amend Rule 1701 by replacing the text "The Mintor of P-Notes is the Bank" with
the text "The Mintor of P-Notes is the Chancellor.  Newly created units of
P-Notes are added to the Bank's holdings, any Rule to the contrary
notwithstanding.".

Amend Rule 1696 by replacing the text "The Mintor of VTs is the Bank" with the
text "The Mintor of VTs is the Chancellor.  Newly created units of VTs are
added to the Bank's holdings, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.".

Amend Rule 1846 by replacing the text "Their Mintor is the Bank" with the text
"Their Mintor is the Chancellor.  Newly created units of Ergs are added to the
Bank's holdings, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.".

Amend Rule 1435 by replacing the text "The Mintor of Indulgences is the Bank"
with the text "The Mintor of Indulgences is the Chancellor.  Newly created
units of Indulgences are added to the Bank's holdings, any Rule to the contrary
notwithstanding.".

[Make the Chancellor the Mintor of all "official" Currencies, but make newly
minted units start out in possession of the Bank.]

Amend Rule 1817 as follows:

Recordkeepors' Obedience to Transfer Orders

      A Recordkeepor is required to abide by all valid Transfer Orders
      submitted by the Executor of the owner of the units of Currency
      to be transferred (or, with respect to any entity which lacks an
      Executor, by any other person empowered by the Rules to execute
      Transfer Orders on the behalf of such entities), except for
      those transfers which would result in an entity possessing a
      negative quantity of Currency, which are considered invalid.  A 
      Recordkeepor must refrain from honoring invalid Transfer Orders.
      Transfers shall be noted on the Recordkeepor's records in the
      order in which they are received by the Recordkeepor.

      Whenever a Transfer Order naming the Bank as payor would result in
      the Bank possessing a negative quantity of Currency, the
      Recordkeepor shall issue a Payment Order from the Bank for the
      same amount of Currency and to the same payee as specified in the
      Transfer Order.

[Clarifies the idea that TOs resulting in negative holdings are essentially
invalid and that a Recordkeepor is not allowed to honor invalid TOs.  Also
takes care of the problem caused by Bank pay-outs that are made when the Bank
has insufficient funds.]

Amend Rule 1470 by deleting the text "The Bank has Mint Authority".

[Mint Authority has been transferred to the Chancellor for the three "official"
Currencies, so the Bank no longer needs Mint Authority.]

Amend Rule 1735 by changing the Title to "The Chancellor's Banking Duties", by
deleting the text "The Chancellor is the Executor of the Bank.", by deleting
the text "(as the Bank's Executor)", and by deleting the entire last paragraph.

[The definition of "satisfy" for Payment Orders requires the Chancellor to
execute TOs for the Bank's POs.  Under this scheme, the Chancellor can no
longer commit Misappropriation because only TOs authorized by the Rules are
honored when the Bank is payor.]

Amend Rule 1479 by replacing the first occurrence of "Payment Order" with
"Transfer Order".

[Now anytime the Rules say "pay out", it means all the Player has to do is
issue a TO from the Bank to the payee.]

Amend Rule 1712 by replacing the text "and issue a Payment Order from the Bank
to that Player for one Indulgence" with the text "and pay out one Indulgence to
that Player".
