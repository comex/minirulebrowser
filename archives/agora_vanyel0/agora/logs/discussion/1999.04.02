Opposed.

Essentially, this has all the economic problems of Summary Adoption, but
without the administrative advantages.

What economic problems? Any proposal one tried to make this way would
require more votes than if one went the normal route. Currently,
it takes 3 votes to pass a proposal. Under the proposed system, 
it'd take at least ten. I don't think this route would be chosen by
most Players, but it would be available for uncontroversial proposals.

The defenition of trivial is not important,  If the rule was changed so 
that proposals to be adopted without objection can only amend current 
rules rather than create new rules.

As I understood your suggestion, these wouldn't be Votes and so wouldn't
cost VTs.  This means that the value of VTs (and P-Notes) would be
strongly reduced, even more so than by Summary Adoption (where at least
all the Players have to agree that a Proposal should be free.)

I accept your explanation, but you have to admit it *looked* mightily
suspicious. A huge batch of highly non-trivial Proposals, some but not
all of which had appended to them announcements of intention to
Summarily Adopt, proposed en masse right on the cusp of the conveniently
4-day-long Easter break - just long enough to get a Proposal Adopted
Without Objection - a time at which it might be worth a gamble that
several potential Objectors might be away on holidays or otherwise
distracted...I went to bed last night thinking that it had been pretty
shrewdly calculated on your part.

I don't see how that changes things, since you can amend the text of a
current Rule to say anything you like.

Hm... somehow I think that quote would have been better the other way
around.  Or maybe not.

Greetings,

While I don't love the idea, I would prefer it to Summary Adoption as it
currently stands. And such a system would have the advantage of not
needing to override R955 to be effective, and of employing the
safeguards of the regular Proposal-making system (see the dicussion
below). I could probably be persuaded to not to oppose a trial of such a
system, particularly if it had sunset clauses attached, and if it meant
we repealed Summary Adoption. 

But repealing - or even amending - Summary Adoption will not be easy.
It's now entrenched in the Ruleset at Power = 3. Changing it in any way
will require virtual unanimity, which is highly unlikely where such a
controversial Proposal (now Rule) is concerned. I think we're stuck
with it.

I should have made this case against it earlier, while voting on it was
in progress. The fundamental mechanisms of the Ruleset are deeply
entrenched for good reasons. In most cases, we did not allow them to
become so deeply entrenched until we had seen them in action for a good
long time and were very sure they didn't contain any unpleasant
surprises. (At any rate, this is true of R955.) In hastily adopting a
radical new mechanism which interferes with R955, and entrenching it
immediately at Power = 3, we have created the potential for a lot of
trouble. It's always difficult to see what the full ramifications of a
radical Proposal are at the time it is adopted. If Summary Adoption does
prove to have any nasty loopholes or cause any unexpected and
undesirable effects, it will be extremely difficult to do anything about
them.

I would further argue that some undesirable (although not unexpected)
effects of Summary Adoption are already coming into view. The accident
last night with Scott's Proposal-management script should alert us to
the scam-potential which Summary Adoption presents. Absolute power is
now just four days' collective non-vigilance away from the hands a
sufficiently cunning scamster. Summary Adoption has stripped away two of
the most important safeguards of the normal Proposal-making process: no
limit on the number of Proposals you can make, and no necessity to
submit Proposals to the Promotor. All a scamster has to do now is figure
out a way to slip a scam Proposal past potential Objectors. That's not
an insignificant obstacle, I agree, but neither does it make me feel
particularly safe. With no limit on the number of Proposals one can
make, certain tactical possibilities immediately suggest themselves. We
must all now be permanently on our guard - I'm not the only one who
can't afford to take a four day vacation.

Do you mean: "Appearances to the contrary, things are just what they
seem."? You may be right - that does seem more paradoxical and sinister.
I may change it.

But I was thinking about that quote last night, feeling dissatisfied
with it, actually, more or less for the reasons you give. When you first
hear it, it seems to be clever and subtle and paradoxical, But what does
it actually say? Just that things merely seem to be as they appear, but
aren't really, which is a pretty banal observation. Along with that
thought came the thought that I would therefore probably change it soon,
perhaps to "Objects in the mirror are stranger than they appear." But
then it occurred to me that by giving the appearance of paradoxical
subtlety while actually being fairly banal, it's an instance of
precisely the phenomenon it describes, and so is self-referential in
what turns out after all to be a surprisingly interesting, subtle and
paradoxical way! I found this discovery piquant, and am now somewhat
more endeared to the quote than I was. But I still like your version.

But the point is few proposals would make it through this route
since so many votes would be needed. I don't see how it would affect
the value of VTs, which would still be needed by the majority of
proposals.

If this is true, then how did it pass in the first place? I
think this makes a good case that the system everyone seems to be
passionately defending is broken. Exactly four Players voted for 
this Proposal. Four. Only five votes were cast in favor (plus a 
couple of Presences). If this is all it takes to bring down our
mighty machine, then something is wrong with that machine. And how
do you explain that no one, not one single Player voted against? This
is the system you want to protect? If anything, the passage of
Summary Adoption shows that it is obsolete already.

Absolute power was already seven-days collective apathy away from the
hands of a moderately cunning scamster. I'd bet on the second guy
winning first.

I agreed wholeheartedly with this sentiment.  We should hold no
pretenses that Agora is a democratic society at this point; it is
clearly plutocratic, and arguments from democracy should be dismissed
as empty rhetoric.

I challenge Steve to create an economy that preserves democracy, or
else to stop pretending that Agora is, even remotely, democratic.

(I have half a mind to lower the Proposal Bar to zero and set the
Batch Size to six, in order to do my best part to restore democracy.
But it would take a collateral agreement by the Assessor to lower the
Voting Tariff to zero as well for this gesture to be truly effective.)

Protoproposal

==================
A Safeguard

Amend Rule 1728 as follows:

Make the following amendments to subsection (a):

Amend subparagraph (1) to read:

        (1) The Player who seeks to perform the action has made a valid
            announcement of eir intent to perform that action not fewer
            than four days before, nor more than fourteen days before,
            the performance of the action, and this announcement must
            unambiguously describe the action to be performed;

Delete the trailing "and" from subparagraph (3).

Replace the trailing "." with "; and" in subparagraph (4).

Append the following subparagraph:

        (5) In order for an announcement made under subsection (a) (1)
            above to be valid, the announcement must either be the first
            statement within the body of the message text or be
            immediately preceded by another valid (a) (1) announcement,
            and no such announcement may be preceded by more than two
            visible lines of white space.

[Prevents Players from trying to sneak WO announcements through by
imbedding them in other text.]

The subparagraph you propose to append is grammatically inconsistent
with the rest of the Rule.  Subparagraphs (1) thru (4) are clauses;
your proposed (5) is a sentence. :)

Nope, can't have me annoucing my intent to change Rule Titles WO 10
or 15 lines down in the Rulekeepor's Memo.  That would certainly be
an abuse of my authority.

Actually, the other subparagraphs are also sentences.  But you are correct
that there is a semantic inconsistency.  (1) thru (4) describe conditions
which must be met for (a) to be valid, while my proposed (5) specifies
conditions which must be met for (1) to be valid.  I suppose I should
reformat it so that (5) is a subsection of (1).

Oops, you're right.  I should probably restrict this to Adoption Without
Objection.  Anybody think there are other kinds of WO actions that

Protoproposal

================
A Safeguard v. 2

Amend Rule 1728 as follows:

Amend subsection (a) subparagraph (1) to read:

        (1) The Player who seeks to perform the action has made a valid
            announcement of eir intent to perform that action not fewer
            than four days before, nor more than fourteen days before,
            the performance of the action, and this announcement must
            unambiguously describe the action to be performed;

Renumber subsections (b) through (e) to become (c) through (f).

Insert a new subsection (b) after section (a) as follows:

      (b) If the action to be performed is the adoption of a Proposal,
          the announcement made under subsection (a) (1) is only valid
          if it is not preceded by more than two visible lines of white
          space and is either the first statement within the body of its
          message text or is immediately preceded by another valid (a)(1)
          announcement.  Unless another Rule specifies otherwise,
          announcements for other kinds of actions are always considered
          valid.

[Prevents Players from trying to sneak AWO announcements through by
imbedding them in other text, but allows other WO announcements to
be unrestricted.  Also fixes the stylistic problem noted by G.Chaos.]

Well, Summary Adoption passed because I forgot to vote against it. But
you're right that this doesn't explain why others didn't vote against
it. The explanation for that is probably that Summary Adoption seemed to
those who didn't vote against it to be a good idea at the time. None of
the arguments I've been making against it recently had been raised prior
to and during the vote.

That's not true. To get a Proposal distributed, you have to raise its
Priority to get it into a week's batch. Then the Promotor will have to
deal with it. That means it will have to be subjected to scrutiny. Any
power-grabbing Proposal is going to wear its ambitions on its sleeve, so
scrutiny will kill it. And you still have to get the Proposal passed,
which takes at a minimum 3 votes for and 2 declarations of Presence.
Apathy may stop Players voting against a Proposal, but it won't motivate
Players to vote for it, or declare Presence on it.

The situation with Summary Adoption is quite different. Nobody need
scrutinize the Proposal other than the Player making it. And Player
apathy may be enough to get the Proposal passed, if no-one Objects.

I decline the challenge. Who's pretending? Who said anything about
democracy? Vlad didn't, and I certainly didn't, so I'm a little confused
as to why you bring it up. I have never objected to Summary Adoption on
the basis that it's undemocratic. That would be absurd. Agora has not
been a simple democracy for a long time. It is, as you observe, a
plutocracy. Actually, that's a bit simplistic: it would probably be more
accurate to say that it mixes plutocratic and democratic elements. We
decided a long time ago that simple democracy was far too boring. (Of
course, there have alwaysd been dissenting voices, like Andre's and now
Vlad's. And it may be that we want to review that decision, but that's a
separate issue.) If you go back and read my original post following the
passage of Summary Adoption, you'll see that my complaint against it was
that it effectively reintroduces free Proposal-making and voting, thus
undermining the (explicitly plutocratic) concepts that we have been
elaborating here for last few years.

>(I have half a mind to lower the Proposal Bar to zero and set the

>But it would take a collateral agreement by the Assessor to lower the

Whence comes this new found enthusiasm for democracy, Scott? It's never
been much of a concern of yours before. In painting yourself as a
champion of democracy, it's you who's pretending, not I. You have been
as involved in the development of the plutocratic elements of the game
as anyone. And Summary Adoption, while anti-plutocratic, is hardly
democratic either. It's much closer to forms of authoritarianism.

Just because I'm opposed to Summary Adoption, that doesn't imply that I
think the current system is perfect, or even nearly so. I agree with you
that the fact that Summary Adoption was adopted at all without a proper
discussion of its ramifications does not say good things about the
health of the Agoran polity, although I suspect I'd disagree with you
about the source of the problem, and what ought to be done about it. But
I'm quite sure that Summary Adoption is not the answer to our problems.

CotC Steve,

Rubbish.  Practically every parliamentary body has a procedural device
similar to "Summary Adoption": "Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent
that..."  In some bodies, legislation can be adopted by unanimous
consent.  The United States Congress routinely adopts minor rules and
occasionally resolutions by unanimous consent; I believe it is legally
permissible (although politically improbable) for a bill to be so
adopted.

The question is: about what? Are you saying that a system which relies
solely on the vigilance of the Players to protect it against the passage
of an arbitrary Proposal is to be preferred to one which has in addition
procedural safeguards against such an eventuality, on the grounds that
it keeps us on our toes? What stunning logic!

If that's the case, then I'm sure we can devise far superior systems to
Summary Adoption, ones which require *much* more stringent vigilance,
even states of permanent wakefulness.

What - you're not planning to enter, Scott? I'm disappointed. I'd enter
myself, but I fear that any attempt on my part at self-description is
bound to be painfully wide of the mark.

I quite like the idea. Although I have argued in favour of Summary 
Adoption, I recognise that it is not a perfect system. It is still 
too easy to scam by hidden adoption messages and the like. Perhaps 
I was foolish to think that players would refrain from pulling off
such a tired old stunt. (No offence to Vlad, whose attempt at doing
this was at least done with a shot of originality and humour)

I think it is a bug that R955 has to be overridden at all. There ought
to be room for rules of lower power which describe ways of adopting
proposals of lower AI. I would've been happier to see Summary Adoption
adopted with power 1 only, so that it couldn't affect higher power 
rules.

The apathy problem is a big one, but I'm glad to have a shake-up like
this. Apathetic voters should get a bit worried, if you ask me. Failing
to vote should be risky. Summary adoption may have pushed that too far.

Summary Adoption could not have worked at all at Power 1, since the
adoption of any Proposal without a vote would conflict with R106.

We should be careful not to make the mistake of thinking that apathy is
the limit of the problems with Summary Adoption. Say Vlad tries to sneak
a Proposal under our guards. You catch him at it, and Object. Thinking
the matter dealt with, I don't bother Objecting. Four days go by, and
Vlad suddenly notices that your Objection was not sent to the PF.
Seizing his chance, he announces the passage of the Proposal. Here,
apathy is not the problem, but lack of appropriate safegaurds.

More generally, I don't think it's productive to mix together the issues
raised by Summary Adoption and those of voter apathy. They are not the
same. We'd all like it if more Players voted, despite the disincentives
to do so in a system in which voting costs scarce resources. That's why I
introduced the Duty to Vote (and Taxes, too, for that matter). We'd all
like it if every Proposal was properly reviewed in discussion before
going to a vote. But that doesn't mean that the answer is to require
every Player to be permanently on guard for attempted scams.

I would support this, but I think we need to look at Denial of Voting
Privileges at the same time. At present, DoVP is time based, whereas I
think it would make more sense for it to be Proposal-batch based. Ie,
Players should be Denied Voting Privileges on two subsequent batches of
Proposals.

Rule 106 requires that all distributed Proposals be voted upon; it
does not require that a Proposal can be adopted only through voting.
Summary Adoption does in fact require Power 3, but not because of Rule 
106.

Why do we need safeguards?
