I seem to have missed the distribution in which this proposal was

By my count that 41 VTs that have entered circulation in the past few

Bravo! Now we have a contest on our hands, precisely the kind of
political battle we have been striving to create with the Officer Rules.
Of course, it's merely ironic that it's a part of this system that you
are opposed to.

Now, what to do? In a way, your announcement is not immediately drastic,
given the 40-odd VTs that have just been pumped into circulation in
Salaries as a result of your announcement last month. In the short term,
assuming that Blob lowers the Voting Tariff, there'll be enough VTs to
go around.

The medium to long term is another matter.

Not necessarily. A Transfer Order is a Private Order (except for Transfer
orders done by the Chancellor from the Bank), and so it need only be sent
to the person that has to do something, in this case the Promotor, not
necessarily to the PF.

I think as a matter of general policy, I would like to be able to rely
on just reading the CFJ submission to see who is barred from judging.
So it's going to be my policy to interpret R897 as requiring Players who
wish to bar Players from Judging to make such specifications as part of
their CFJ submission. If you feel I've exceeded my authority, feel free
to CFJ. It would make for an interesting paradox of eligibility if you
were to bar me from Judging that CFJ in a message sent separately to
your submission...

I won't pick Andre as Judge.

I think I'm within my interpretative rights. R897:

Rule 897/1 (Power=1)
Barring Players from Judgement

      The Player who submits a Call for Judgement is permitted to
      specify up to three Players who are to be Barred from Judging that
      CFJ.  Any Players that are so Barred are ineligible to Judge that
      CFJ.

I think it's a permissible reading of this Rule that the specification
is permitted only as part of the submission. Certainly, this is not the
only permissible reading.

Hmmm...what is the actual effect of this? Consider R1486:

Rule 1486/4 (Power=1)
Procedure to Impeach an Officer

      Any Active Player is permitted to call a Referendum to
      Impeach an Officer at any time, by requesting such in
      the Public Forum. The Officer is Impeached when such a
      Referendum is passed.

      The Referendum must list both the Office and the current
      Electee to that Office by name. If upon passage of the
      Referendum the named Player is the current Electee of
      that Office, then the Player is immediately removed
      from Office.

      For this Referendum the default procedure for referenda is
      modified as follows: Vote Collector is the Player who called for
      the Impeachment Referendum. Voting Entities do not include the
      Officer under consideration for Impeachment. Adoption Ratio must
      be greater than or equal to 2 for the Referendum to pass.


The Rule says that you're permitted to call for Impeachment, and it
says what happens if the Impeachment Referendum passes, and it even says
what is necessary for that to happen, but it doesn't actually say that
your calling for Impeachment causes a Referendum to be held or to be
required to be held. Just a thought...

...and another: where in the Referendum Rule (1434) does it say in
general what Players are voting *on*?

In any case, I think Impeachment is not a weapon of first resort. Why
not try asking Speaker Murphy to declare that the Office of Chancellor
is being held temporarily? 

Perhaps in the interests of even-handedness, he should declare that 
the Offices of both Assessor and Chancellor are being held temporarily.
The Elections will then function as referenda on the direction of 
economic policy, without the nastiness of Impeachment.

Personally, I find it incredible that any one Player can call for
Impeachment. If the existence of such a mechanism is thought to be
necessary (which I would dispute), it should take three Players to
trigger it at an absolute minimum.

Speaker Murphy?

No disagreement from me on that score; it's been an enlightening

What's the danger in allowing one person to call for Impeachment?

Tempting.  8)  I agree it would be better for the CotC to get all required
CFJ information in one message.  I don't think the Rules as written
would support your policy, but I don't think I'll CFJ.  I think I'll just write
up a proposal to make it explicit.

Thanks.  Of course, if you did pick Andre, then I *would* have to CFJ.   8)

Look at what you just quoted.  You're permitted to call for a Referendum, not
just to call for Impeachment.  The only argument you might make against
Scott's call is that it wasn't a call for a Referendum.  But I think a
natural interpretation of Scott's message was that it was a call for
Referendum as specified in R1486.  IMO, the Referendum has already begun.

I don't think it matters.  There is a Referendum.  You can vote FOR it or
not.  If it passes, then the Rules declare that the Officer is removed
from eir Office.

This is one choice of action, but what if the Speaker and the Officer
you think should be impeaced are in cahoots?  Without Impeachment you
would have no recourse but to wait for the term to expire.

Hmm.  This might be better.  OTOH, it is interesting that one Player
can force a situation where all the other Players may be forced to show
their "true colors" (speaking in an in-game fashion) politically.

I don't think I will support your move to repeal Impeachment, but I would
probably support an amendment to require more Players in the call.  Maybe
make it a kind of Application.

Don't forget the new Herald's Privilege.  This would have been a good

Ok, now are you going to bar Steve as a Judge in a separate statement?  8)

This portion of Rule 1868:

Once assigned as the Judge of a CFJ, that Player remains the
      Judge of that CFJ until e is recused from that CFJ, or e ceases
      to be a Player.

strongly suggests Players can not be Barred after the fact.

No, I don't think so, as that would force Steve to pre-judge the
issue.  Maybe you think that would be a good thing.  :-)

Because I merely called for his Impeachment; I did not call a
Referendum on his Impeachment.  I think the distinction is
significant.

Rule 116 permits me to just call for Impeachment.  True, no Rule lends
any legal significance to the act should I do so, but it's perfectly
permissible to do it.

I didn't call a Referendum.  I called for his Impeachment.  Anyone who 
wants to is free to take up the gauntlet and initiate Impeachment
proceedings.  Is Ken Starr out there?

The Referendum, obviously.

Why?  You still have to have a vote, after all.

OK, in the light of the morning, the Rule looks different. I agree with

Not so. You could try and replace the Speaker by means of a Rebellion.

I thought about that, but I wanted the transfer to be made by me, not

This sounds to me like an ex post facto attempt to avoid having to
conduct a Referendum about which you are now having second thoughts. I
believe that at the time you sent that message you intended to initiate
a Referendum by sending it - else why send it to the Public Forum? (The
message was sent to agora-business.)

Of course your intention is neither here nor there. You may well be
right that we should distinguish between calling for the Impeachment of
an Officer and calling for a Referendum to Impeach that Officer. On
reflection, though, I doubt it. It's too nitpicky a distinction. If
someone else were now arguing as you do that your message did not
initiate a Referendum, and you were insisting that it did, I think I'd
agree with you. So I guess I do think that the Referendum has begun.

Actually, you're right.  But Rebellion carries some risk.  Also, it gets rid of
*all* Officers, not just the one you want to impeach.  It's a very blunt
instrument, and more extreme than impeachment, IMO.

>Better still, I think, make it an Action with 3 Supporters.

Yes, that would probably be best.

H. Rulekeepor Chuck,

May I suggest the following unofficial annotation be made to R1030:

     In CFJs 1114 and 1115, the Judges re-affirmed the doctrine of
     'situational precedence' (without using the term), according to
     which precedence relationships between Rules are determined in
     specific situations, and not generally.

The point might be to get the Speaker to relent rather than face a
Rebellion, which might not actually be necessary.

The result is drastic, *if* the Referendum passes.  The process
itself is no more drastic than any other Referendum.

Actually, no, I am not having second thoughts.  I am merely living by
the Rule of Law, which says quite clearly that I failed to perform the 
necessary acts to start a Referendum.

What difference does it make what my intent was?

I insist that it did not.

Nonsense.  There's nothing drastic at all about calling for
Impeachment.  It's being Impeached that's drastic.
