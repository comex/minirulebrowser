A final point about precedence relations and the situation with respect
to Rules 1585, 1686 and 1023. My position has been that R1023 attempts
to defer to R1686, but cannot do so becasue R1482 forces higher Powered
Rules to take precedence of lower Powered Rules. Michael's position has
been that R1023 does not conflict with R1686 because it defers to it.

I think it's interesting to compare Rules 1030 and 1482:

Rule 1030/4 (Power=3)
Precedence Between Rules with Equal Power

      If two or more Rules with the same Power conflict with one
      another, then the Rule with the lower Number takes precedence.

      If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of Rule) or
      takes precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supercede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.

Rule 1482/1 (Power=3)
Precedence Between Rules with Unequal Power

      In a conflict between Rules with different Power, the Rule with
      the higher Power takes precedence over the Rule with the lower
      Power.


The first paragraphs of each of the Rules are analogous. They both give
a rule for resolving conflicts in the cases with which the respective
Rules are concerned. So it's significant, I think, that R1482 contains
nothing analogous to the second paragraph of R1030. If it did have such
a paragraph, it would say something like this:

      If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of Rule) or
      takes precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supercede the Power method for determining
      precedence.

and in that case, even on my view that the two Rules conflict, I'd have
to agree with Michael at least that the provisions in R1686 prevail over
those in R1023, Power notwithstanding. But there is no such paragraph.
