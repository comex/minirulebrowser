region of 1000 hours study to get my Diploma of Information Technology. Of
these, somewhere in the region of 10 hours were specific to the internet.

Not necessarily.  You're using politician's logic.

Surely you meant to send this to business, not discussion?

This logic is quite suitable for a Jester, so this is certainly very
much in character, but I guess Agora follows more boring variants of
logic. Note that in standard logic, it does _not_ follow from A => B
that B => A, and in the present case you are trying to make such an
argument with A="P3690 has been adopted" and B="No rule with the title
LET JESTER BE FÉTED has been created".

I hereby call for Nominations for the newly created Office of
Accountor, a lovely job with a whopping 1.5 VTs salary, up there with
the Assessor, Promotor and Registrar.  (Below the Archivist, but
that's something that's a definite anomaly in my opinion.)

Michael.

Nominations don't have to be to the Public Forum.  As long as I see
them, they're valid. 

I saw Crito's nomination.

What the heck?  Rule 1504 only specifies that the Judge must work
through the Clerk of the Courts IF THE CFJ FINDS A PLAYER TO HAVE
COMMITTED A CRIME.  You show me where in my Judgement I state that.
No where in the whole thing did I mention a crime, I just suggested a
remedy to the problem.

Fine, I'll still fight you on this one.  I did make a mistake in not
issuing an Injunction to the Clerk of the Courts, but I think I can
argue that the Injunction I did issue is valid.  That last line does
not say that the ONLY Injunction a Judge may make is the one to the
Clerk of the Courts.  Thus you can fault me for forgetting the
required Injunction, but I don't see where you have a problem with the
latter.

(In fact, R663 seems to imply that a Player is free to make as many
 Injunctions as seen fit.)

I see two issues in this appeal.

1) Was your Injunction of a type explicitly defined in the Rules? (663
(iv))
2) Was your Injunction appropriate for the situation?

The only Rule that could work for (1) is Rule 1736.  The argument that it
does has been tried before, by Morendil.  Unfortunately the Injunctions he
made were so over the top that I don't think the Justices bothered to
consider (1) carefully, but just threw it out over (2), thus giving
Morendil 50 Blots and making him our first Lawless Player.  So I don't
think (1) has yet been sufficiently considered by the courts.  I may
remember wrong.

In your case, (2) is more plausible, although I won't bet on it.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

I think it is more subtle than that. It hinges on the definition of
"adopted". If you regard "adopting" a proposal as some event, one 
consequence of which is that the changes it dictates have effect, 
then you are right that B does not imply A.

BUT: If you regard "adopting" a proposal as synonymous with performing
the changes that it describes, then Jester's argument is sound.

Sadly, it seems to me that the first definition is the one supported
by the rules. Eg: R1561 talks about a rule which has been adopted 
but which explicitly does not take effect. The two are not synonymous.

I do not appreciate the boorish way in which you condemned Jester 
without trying to appreciate the subtlety of what he was saying. I
think it was a good effort for a new player. A Kudo transfer will 
follow.

I find the latter interpretation sufficiently counterintuitive that I
cannot characterize it as other than absurd.  It seems patently
obvious to me that the nonadoption of a Proposal can have no effect
(other than those warranted by existing law as a consequence for the
nonadoption of Proposals generally), regardless of its wording.  The
opposite argument is not only badly inconsistent with Rule 594 (and
others), but obviously leads to some pretty stark absurdities (for
example, if a Proposal fails, it can never be reproposed and
subsequently adopted without generating a paradox).  I therefore
cannot imagine how anyone could reasonably adopt the stance that
Jester's argument requires.

If Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 11 applied, I'd move for sanctions for
presenting an argument neither warranted by existing law nor based on
a nonfrivilous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal
of existing law or the establishment of new law.  I consider Jester's
argument frivilous, and holding it in contempt on that basis is
grounds for a Kudo transfer, so be it.  

I do appreciate the "subtle distinction" he was seeking to exploit; I
merely think that doing so displays no particular talent, except for
what I call "wordmangling", and as such not worthy of more than
summary dismissal.
