You forget that I wasn't around when the Walrus episode occurred.
I didn't know that Waggie had Left In A Huff.

As I understand the current legal situation, voting is something only
your Executor (that's me) can do on your behalf. See CFJ 1060. Hm, it
might be different for declaring Presence, though: that's a
possibility worth looking into.

Not sure about this either.

It seems to me that Agora does, in the main, make sense, at least
enough sense to keep playing it. It's not as if we'd just replaced
every number in the Ruleset with 'A Suffusion of Yellow'. The little
nuggets of conceptual nonsense, like the status of the Frankenstein
Monster or the fact that ownership of VTs is not apparently limited
to the kinds of entities it ought intuitively to be limited to, are
just weird things happening at the margins, being resolved in wider
context of sensibility.

If eveything worked perfectly, what would we spend our time doing?
It seems to me that the most interesting part of the game is finding
the bugs in the Rules, working out their consequences and correcting
them. God help us if we ever run out of bugs. We'll die of boredom.

I don't know what you mean by 'formal systems' in this context. Legal
systems are not formal systems as I understand those terms. I understand
us as being engaged in a collective task of evolving a legal system,
not a formal system.

Why is that a cause for cynicism? Are you the only Player to have a
Proposal rejected by electorate as unnecessary? I worked for 3 months
on the first version of the Powers, only to see KoJen successfully
propose to have them repealed before they'd been in action a month!
Although I found this frustrating and upsetting, I redoubled my
resolve and entered into long and complex negotations with the
opponents of the Powers, in order to determine what changes they
wanted made before they felt they could support them. Some, like
KoJen, were implacably opposed and so there was no point negotiating
with them. I negotiated with the others instead, and eventually
secured enough support for the Powers to have them enacted a second
time, and with a broader base of support. 

The electorate might have judged your proposed further refinements
to be unnecessary. I had been conceding for the sake of argument that
the proto you claimed to have up your sleeve really was superior to P3578
and demonstrably so to the satisfaction of the electorate. If we relax
that assumption, then we're talking about a proto which perhaps is no
better, in the opinion of the electorate, than the one already before
it. Why indeed shouldn't the electorate reject such a Proposal? I don't
imagine that you're claiming that your Proposals should be adopted
regardless of their actual merits.

But, as I say, the point is moot: the proto remains hypothetical.
What can be gained from discussing how the electorate might have
received a hypothetical proto? On the other hand, you're more than
welcome to shift the discussion into the realms of the concrete
by actually posting some of your refinements. Then we can judge
them on their merits.

As I've already noted, neither consent nor desire to register are
necessary for registration to occur. Just look at Morendil's
reregistration of Elde.

Presence is declared by Players, not by Executors.

This may not settle anything, in particular whether you are empowered
to vote, since it rather depends on what you think Executors are
empowered to do.  R1478 defines an Executor as follows:

      The Executor of an entity is a Player who is empowered by the
      Rules to act on behalf of that entity, as if e was that entity.

As I have noted previously, there are two ways of reading this, a
general way and a specific way. Read generally, being a Player's
Executor empowers you do anything they would ordinarily be able
to do. Conversely, to be your own Executor, you have to show that
you are empowered to do all those things. If you can't vote or
make Transfer Orders, for instance, you won't count as your own
Executor.

Read specifically, being a Player's Executor only empowers you to
do certain things, eg make Transfer Orders, and vote. Conversely,
if you are empowered to do certain things, eg register and make
Proposals, you may therefore count as your own Executor - but it
won't follow from that that you can vote or make Transfer Orders.

It seems that what you really need to settle is the direct question
of whether you are empowered to vote on your own behalf. We have
one Judgement (in CFJ 1060) which suggests that you are not, but the
question has not been definitively settled.

One of the motivations I have in constructing new systems is the
ongoing creation of bugs, so that we may be amused, confounded,
frustrated, befuddled, or plain dumbstruck by them.  I have never
claimed that any of my big proposals were bug free.

A formal system cannot be coded in English.  English is far too
poorly-defined for that purpose.

On the other hand, if I were to vote on Swann's behalf, which I think
I'm empowered to do as his Executor, that'd take precedence over any
declarations of Presence he might have made, correct? (I don't mean
'take precedence' in the sense of any Rule conflict occurring, but rather
in the sense that the votes would count, and the declarations would be
superfluous.)

As one of the 'evil forces' of which Oerjan spoke, I suppose I should
say something about what we're up to. I hope my fellow conspirators
will forgive me for speaking out unilaterally. It's not our intention
to deprive our various Zombies of their rights in any permanent way.
Rather, we wish to use the temporary leverage our control over the
Zombies gives us to press for our demands to be met. We urge calm :)

And what, precisely, are our demands? Well, we're not entirely sure
yet, but let me try this out on you, the rest of the Agoran community,
as a formal offer (and again my co-conspirators will have to forgive
me for my unilateral action, but we really have to move things forward):

      We, the Executors in Probate of the various deregistered
      Players, will agree to relinquish what control we have of said
      Players and terminate Probate for them, and to support
      Proposals aimed at closing the loopholes which have allowed
      this situation to arise, in exchange for a Win each, and some
      appropriate Patent Title recognizing our morbid tendencies, say,
      the Patent Title of Necrophiliac.

How say you, fair citizens of the light?

A surprising and, I think, rather dubious claim. Consider the _Principia
Maethmatica_ of Russell and Whitehead. It's a formal system of mathematics
entirely written in the language of symbolic logic. Or so it would seem.
Yet at some point, in order to explain what any of it means, you have to
advert to English words to explain the meanings of the logical atoms of
the language employed. If those English words are, as you claim, poorly
defined, then precise formalization is completely impossible. I don't
think you're prepared to admit that. So my guess is you'll have to give
up your claim that English is too poorly defined to codify a formal
system. You just have choose your words carefully.

Trivially FALSE, if you ask me.  The new Officer can post the required
Report within a week of assuming Office and still fail ASAP, if e does

In principle, yes. This time I was in a bit of a hurry (I wanted to
post the rules in this month to make sure I don't make more mistakes),
so I didn't get around to requiring a plain text one from the IN

I've discovered what I consider a bug in 1715 (Annoucing One's
Presence) - Presence must be declared in a message to the assessor, no
matter who is responsible for the Proposal, Election or Referendum
concerned. Therefore I would suggest the following amendment:

Amend 1715 by replacing the sentence       

      A Player may declare that e is PRESENT on a Proposal, Election
      or Referendum, by sending a message to the Assessor to that
      effect.

with

      A Player may declare that e is PRESENT on a Proposal, Election
      or Referendum, by sending a message to that effect to the Vote 
      Collector of this Proposal, Election or Referendum.

At the same time, correct the spelling error in the rule's title so it
reads "Announcing One's Presence" (not "Annoucing").

I think the point Scott is missing here that 'people' can be either
singular or plural depending on context.  People can be used as a plural
of person, or as a synonym for nation, in which case it is singular, and
has the plural 'peoples'.
In the above case, at least in the example zefram gives, it is used as
singular noun.

Just a side remark: who is this Plato you're referring to? I know that
there once was a philosopher of that name (I've read some of his books
in school, and yes, in Greek), but the Plato you refer to might also
be your dog, or anybody else whose parents had a weird taste for
names.

Of course, had you written "Steve" or "Kolja" it would be quite clear
that you are talking about the players of Agora, although there are
plenty of other people with these names - after all, the Agora players
Kolja or Steve are the obvious persons an Agora CFJ should refer to.

I would be tempted to dismiss this CFJ under 1565 ii), because it is
not clear which Plato you refer to.

I never actually got around to putting together the actual proto (which
is why it was never posted).  But the last revision I wrote included
changing all the alleging things to explicit actions, for clarity, and a
paragraph actually defining what happens if someone posts to the PF and is
made Quiet in the same message (the current Proposed version falls down
if a Proposal saying "The Assessor hereby becomes Quiet" is adopted).
These changes I am sure would be deemed unnecessary by the electorate,
and would be voted down.  But I think you'll agree that they are also
a clear improvement on the current Proposal.

I think it would only be fir to include the zombie players in such a Win

If it's trivially false for that reason, that's OK with me - the
recent, disputed reports of FtR were then wrong, which is my point.
But I wonder - if a Player violates ASAP, e commits the Infraction
of Tardiness, not that of Failure to Report.

Trivially FALSE, if you ask me.  The new Officer can post the required
Report within a week of assuming Office and still fail ASAP, if e does
things in the wrong order.

A Declaration of Presence is without significance if that Player has

Well, I guess there are certian perks to being a zombie, after all,
Steve now has to deal with all my debts. :)

I just checked the rules and it seems pretty clear that I am free to
propose though. Rule 1605 defines _players_ as proposing entities, and just
adds the bit that a Proposing Entity must have an Executor.  I have an
Executor (There's no doubt about that at least) and I am a Player (Since I
am a person who posted a message requesting to be registered) therefore
I am a Proposing Entity by 1605 Q.E.D.

Note that 1605 gives no instruction about what function the Executor has,
given the wording, I doubt it has _any_ in this particular case since 1483
is quite clear in saying that if the Proposing Entitiy delivers some text
labeled as a Proposal, that text is a Proposal.  It does not say "The
executor of the Proposing Entity. (Directly Opposed to 683 which specifies
that Votes are cast by the Executor of a Voting Entity.)

Is this a bug or a feature?

Swann
============================
Rules for Refrence:

Rule 1483/3 (Power=1)
Definition of Proposals

      A Proposal is created whenever a Proposing Entity delivers some
      collection of text to the Promotor with the clear indication
      that that text is intended to become a Proposal.  The collection
      of text thus delivered is a new Proposal, and the Proposing
      Entity which delivered it its Proposer. A collection of text is
      said to be Proposed when it becomes a Proposal.

      The delivery of the text of an existing Proposal which was
      Proposed less than three weeks previously does not cause that
      text to become another Proposal, unless there is a clear
      indication that that text is intended to become a duplicate of a
      prior Proposal.  In this case, the Proposing Entity must
      specifically acknowledge that the intended new Proposal is a
      duplicate of an existing Proposal.

      Further, the Promotor's distribution of previously undistributed
      Proposals never causes the Proposing of new Proposals.

[CFJ 762: Anything contained in a Proposal is part of that Proposal,
 unless the Rules or Game Custom specifically says otherwise.]

==============================================================
  
Rule 1605/1 (Power=1)
Proposing Entities

      Let there exist a type of entity called a Proposing Entity.
      Only Proposing Entities have the right to make Proposals,

      Each Player is a Proposing Entity.  Other entities are Proposing
      Entities only if defined as such by the Rules.

      Any other Rule notwithstanding, in order to make a Proposal, a
      Proposing Entity must have an Executor.

History:
Created by Proposal 2522, Mar. 10 1996
Amended(1) by Proposal 3533 (General Chaos), Jul. 15 1997, substantial

Authors: ..., General Chaos

=====================
Rule 683/5 (Power=1)
Legal Votes

      A Vote upon a Proposal must be one of FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN
      (or an obvious synonym of one of these).  Something which is not
      one of these is not a Vote upon a Proposal.

      A Vote cast upon a Proposal by a Voting Entity which has an
      Executor is cast at the time its Executor either posts it to the
      Public Forum or otherwise sends it to the Assessor.  A Vote is
      legally cast if it is cast during the Voting Period of that
      Proposal, and if that Voting Entity is entitled to cast a Vote
      on that particular Proposal.

      A Vote cast by a Voting Entity which does not have an Executor
      is cast at a time and in a manner specified in other Rules.

      This Rule in no way authorizes any Entity to cast Votes upon
      Proposals.

I interpret the Rules that way too. I think you can do anything
that's in the Player's authority to do rather than the Player's
Executor as specifically provided for by certain Rules. For
instance, transferring Kudos - now that is one way of doing the
things you cannot otherwise do : you could threaten Steve to deKudo
him unless he agrees to carry out actions that only the Executor is
empowered to carry out, such as changing your Location.

Actually, I think a moral duty - and possibly a legal one - is 
incurred by an Executor. That Player is defined as one who acts 
"as if e were" the Player whose Executor e is. If Steve were you, e 
would have moved to the Beer Hall and Rebelled after registering; 
it's possible that Steve would be in violation of 1478 in not doing 
so - on your behalf, of course.

Against. Fear of penalties should not hinder a Player's ability to
call upon the higher courts when not satisfied by the determination
of the lower, if he so wishes.

Try this, to be inserted in 1732 :

    A Payment Order is Partially Satisfied when a Transfer Order from
   the payor to the payee named therein, for an amount of the Currency
   named that is less than the amount named therein, is successfully 
   executed for the purpose of partially satisfying that Payment Order.

   Such a Payment Order becomes a Payment Order for the original
   amount minus the amount transferred, and the Recordkeepor shall
   be required to alter their records of that particular Payment 
   Order accordingly.

[This assumes that the bug with one TO satisfying multiple POs is 
dealt with elsewhere.]

Then we might as well abolish the lower court entirely, for less than one
decision in five stands without appeal.

I have a systematic approach to handling both division and

about date of execution around here somewhere.

That sounds like I will have to make a countably infinite number of
random determinations. Much thanks.

I'm not so sure this actually triggered so many actions. Really, what
the "all actions" phrase means is "I perform all actions that can be
performed by simply stating that I perform them". 

Making CFJs, for example, requires sending a document to the CotC;
making TOs requires naming payors and payees; movement requires
naming a destination; and so forth. If I were an officer responsible
for some actions possibly involved I'd do nothing and wait for COEs -
the proof that this general phrase triggered anything rests with the
wannabe action performer, I think.

Of course, in this light I wonder how much sense statements of similar
generality make, like (quote - I'm not doing this :) "I hereby to
everything required to come off hold, vote for proposal xyz and do
everything required to go on hold again". Such phrases have appeared
quite often recently, and I wonder whether they are valid just as much
as in the above, blatantly unspecific and general announcement.

Dear Vlad,

I am afraid some of these proposals would have found it easier to get
my vote if they had been protoed. Well, I'll do my nitpicking now -
if they get adopted, you or I can propose amendments; if they don't,
maybe you can improve some details slightly befroe you repropose.

Please don't take this criticism to heart too much - I don't want to
create new enmities or personla feuds or somesuch thing ;)

>>

<<

Why this limitation? It makes pardons a matter of personal favors, but
destroys the chance to use pardons as a remedy for trouble people are
not, or not fully, responsible for - e.g. due to rules bugs etc. If
there is a bug that drives people into lawlessness, it will very
probably reach several players at the same time (like the recent
indulgence debt problem did).

>>

I consider myself one of the more low-ranking players of Agora (no big
offices, no nothing), and I feel very good about having a chance to
appeal judgements without fear of bad consequences. I don't think
unnecessary appeals are such a problem.

If the appeals court has too much work on its hands, maybe appeals
should be handled by a larger group of people, e.g. by making random
assignments to the court of appeal from all senators originally
eligible to judge the CFJ.

Amend Rule 217 by removing the phrase "game custom"

Again, on a rather personal note, I rather like the game custom thing,
because for me the anglosaxon case law and precedence stuff is rather
exotic and fun to play with.

This is interesting, but we've just had a major new paradigm
installed for dealing with Currencies. Isn't this a bit too early to
repeal that paradigm and putting one more brand new one in its
place ?

Suber knows I'm no neophobe, but this is maybe carrying it a bit too 
far.





( Actually, he ver probably doesn't. That's the problem with a
non-omniscient, non-omnipotent deity, all the nice phrases that apply 
to the standard sort of deity are untruths.)

The point is not to allow blanket amnesties, but to allow some leniency
for Players whose penalties may outweigh their Crimes (such as, IMO,
Morendil).

The problem is it's too easy. The Appeals Court should, IMO, only be used
to right a patently wrong decision, not as a second roll of the dice or to
prolong debate on an issue. I see no problem with inducing people to think
carefully before initiating an appeal--the penalty is only 1 blot after
all.

Fine, I don't figure this to be too popular. But I don't think its too
rational to subordinate the current situation to a half-assed practice on
a distantly related issue several years ago. And as I said before, if
following Game Custom is appropriate in a particular case, it falls under
"The best interests of the Game"

I'm not sure there are any.  The full effect of Rule 1713, and
Proposal 3568's amendment to it, are not clear to me.  It seems quite
clear to me that, at this moment, the Infraction of Persistent
Indebtedness is undefined by the Rules.

As Assessor, I have previously reported Infractions of Persistent
Indebtedness for Blob in Week 216, General Chaos and Swann in Week
217, and Harlequin in Weeks 220, 221, and 222.  If I reported any
other Infractions, I can't find any record of having reported them.
