This may be an argument for drastically lowering the Voting Token
Circulation level, to, say, 5 VTs per Player. The argument would be
that Players would have an incentive to spend the VTs they have if
know that hoarding more than 5 VTs at a time is impossible.

More generally, any ideas for ways to encourage Players to vote
whilst maintaining VT scarcity are to be encouraged. Do you think
it's possible Morendil?

It would appear that it has been repealed.  That's nomic for you.

Current new Player privileges tend to center around the Grace Period, see
Rule 1676, 1677, 1678 and 1583.

> P.S.  What's a Walrus.

Time to get out gunzip... this is BethMo's explanation:

>>>>
The "Walrus scam" was one of the most entertaining bits in the entire
history of Nomic, IMHO -- not for the scam itself, but for the
discussion which followed. The scam was fairly simple. A Rule had been
passed that prohibited proposals from directly giving/subtracting
points to/from voters based on their votes for/against that proposal.
The Walrus proposal, instead, created "happy walruses" and "sad
walruses" and awarded them to those who voted for/against the
proposal. Then, some miniscule amount of time later (I don't remember
the exact figure, but it was a number of seconds with a large negative
exponent), all of the walruses would convert themselves into positive
and negative points and self-destruct. After the Walrus proposals
passed, some of the more studious members of the populace pointed out
that this time unit was small enough that, due to the uncertainity
principle, the actual numbers of walrusses could not be determined,
according to modern physics. From there, the discussion became more
and more obscure, including speculation on the "ideal walrus" and
whether an ideal walrus had no hair, or an infinite number of hairs.
The officer responsible for awarding the points refused to do so until
the question as to whether the walrusses could be measured was settled
by CFJ; this got the originator of the scam so annoyed that e finally
quit the game in disgust.

As a legend, no.  However, it's no longer in the Rules.  I was
able to use the Rules Search at
http://www.dfw.net/~ccarroll/agora/rules/search.html
(blatant plug) to quickly ascertain that.

According to the long-out-of-date Agora FAQ, it's a large mammalian

I hereby transfer 2 Indulgences and 2 VTs to the Bank to satisfy

Well, as you only registered to play on Saturday 18, you aren't eligible
for last week's benefits. But this week's benefits will be paid to you
by the Registrar, Michael Norrish. To be more precise, Registrar Michael
will issue a Payment Order, and Chancellor Michael will satiasfy it. In
fact, they may have been paid to you already. Watch out for a message
from Michael entitled "Bank Transaction Notices". You don't have to do
anything.

 Well, I was a Player for part of the last Nomic Week, Saturday in fact.  The
rule doesn't state That I needed to be a player for the entire week, ar even
most of it.  The rule does not state that the Player had to be registered the
prior week, just "not receive any Officer's Salary for the previous week". I
have not received an Officers Salary the previous week.  I would have
remembered if I had. 

I want Unemployment Benefits for last week.

There is a small grey area in the Rule, although I'm not sure it'll help
you any. The Rule requires the Registrar to make the payment as soon as
possible after the beginning of the Nomic Week. So a case could arise
where a New Player registered before the Registrar made the payments. In
that case, it might be argued that the Registrar has to pay the New
Player, the argument being that the Registrar should pay every
unemployed person who is a Player at the time e makes the payments. On
the other hand, it could equally (or perhaps even better) be argued that
the Registrar need only pay those unemployed persons who were Players at
the beginning of the Week. Here the argument is that since the Registrar
incurs the obligation at the beginning of the Week (ie that's when the
asap clock starts ticking), that's the natural time to measure the state
of the game with respect to who qualifies for Unemployment Benefits. Or
so I would argue before a Judge.

In the present case, since I was away last week, I don't know if Michael
had already paid the benefits before you Registered. I assume he did. In
that case, I think it's clear that you don't qualify. If you weren't a
Player at the time the Registrar made the payments, then the Registrar
had no obligation to pay you anything, and your registration does
nothing that I can see to create a new obligation on the Registrar to
pay you.

>I want Unemployment Benefits for last week.

If you find my argument unpersuasive, and can get no joy from Michael, I
suggest you Call for Judgement

I have a sinking feeling. I've just noticed that R1645 (Temporary
Delegation of Office) only allows Electees to Delegate. According
to R1555, and Electee ceases to be an Electee when is retired from
Office, something which, according to R1556, happens at the expiry of a
Term of Service. In short, I was not an Electee to the Offices of
Assessor or Wizard when I attempted to Delegate those Offices. Which
means that Blob and Chuck were never Delegated to those Offices. Ulp.

Anyone care to show me I'm wrong? Please?
