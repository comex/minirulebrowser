The problem is that all aspects of the economy are arbitrary and
fixed.  Your endless tinkering with inflows and outflows (which will,
of course, never solve the problem, just shuffle it around into mazes
of ever-growing complexity) will never fix that.

I think that in both stopping people from saving (with your suggestion
to lower the VTCL), and in forcing them to spend on voting, you are
removing, or at least making more difficult, a possible strategy for
game-play, and I think that's bad.  The strategy in question is one
I've been attempting to play myself, and that is to accumulate VTs as
an insurance policy against Indulgence problems and to be able perhaps
to swing votes on crucial proposals.  Actually, I wouldn't be
surprised if my voting behaviour was actually compatible with 'A Duty
to Vote', but I've also been pretty well paid thanks to having held
three salaried offices until recently.  Others might not find it so
easy to pursue this strategy if 'A Duty to Vote' passed.

How about this (an idea had over the weekend): 

Allow a proposal to be made free-to-vote by having people pay the
Promotor (in VTs) in advance of its distribution.  You could make this
cost as much as the number of Players multiplied by the current Voting
Tariff, but I think it would be more encouraging to give someone being
so charitable a discount of perhaps 50%.

All Players could vote once on a free-to-vote proposal without charge,
so that the Assessor would only bill people for second votes, (and
groups if they voted at all).

Another twist (though probably more complicated without real reward)
might be to allow for the funding of a limited number of votes, and
then that many votes on the proposal would be free, but subsequent
votes would be charged.  I don't much like this, but it might appeal
to the particularly frugal. 

The model I have in mind is that the proposor of a proposal would pay
not only a P-Note to get it distributed, but would also make a
free-for-vote payment.  This is better than just distributing VTs to 
Players as it is better targetted and does not require lots of
miniature contracts to be repeatedly negotiated, but worse in that
there is no guarantee that people will vote in a particular way. 

Michael.

What I'd say we have is a not completely well-designed game.
Nevertheless, there are a number of good ideas in the current design
which I think are worth further elaboration. 

Do you have any ideas to fix the economy, or is your preferred option
to "do away with it entirely", whatever that might mean?

What does that mean, precisely? All aspects of every game are arbitrary.
For that matter, the whole universe might be arbitrary - we don't have a
satisfactory answer to the question: why is there something rather than
nothing?

But from a perspective internal to the game, the elements of the economy
do not seem to me to be arbitrary. If Nomic is essentially anything (a
dubious claim perhaps), then it is essentially a game of making
proposals and voting on them (although Fascist comes to mind as a
counterexample). So the existence of VTs and P-Notes is internally
justified and so not arbitrary. That doesn't mean we couldn't get rid of
them and try something completely different - of course we could. But
these are the ideas we're exploring at the moment.

What do you mean by 'fixed'?

>Your endless tinkering with inflows and outflows (which will, of
>course, never solve the problem, just shuffle it around into mazes of

But I'm not really 'tinkering' with inflows and outflows, at least at
the moment. What I understand by 'tinkering' is changing individual
Rules so that certain actions give greater or lesser rewards or
penalties of economic items. For example, amending the Zeitgeist Rule
(1047) so that Zeitgeists get only 1 P-Note rather than 3 was tinkering.
Most of the tinkering of that kind that needs to be done has been done.
But the creations of R1852 (Ciruclation of Voting Tokens) and R1854 (The
Chancellor can set the BOS) are not tinkering, but significant
conceptual developments. I'm not saying that these Rules will forever be
enshrined as features of our game, but I think they are sufficiently
interesting ideas to be worth playing around with for a while yet.

I'd support this. Or even Chuck's suggestion to give Blots to all 
non-Rebelling players.

It had never occurred to me that reducing P-Note supply would encourage
more Proposals, any more than reducing VT supply was supposed to
encourage people to vote. The purpose of reducing supply is to prevent
the value of economic items being reduced by inflation.

Of course, if nobody has any interest in making Proposals, then the
value of P-Notes is going to be close to zero whatever the situation is
with respect to P-Note supply. The concept of P-Notes is premised on
there being Players who wish to make Proposals. At the moment, that
doesn't seem to be the case - and this is a problem which we need to
address. But 'The P-Note Tap' is not designed to address it.
