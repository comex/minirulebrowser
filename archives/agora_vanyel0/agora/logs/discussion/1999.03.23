I suggest you arrange for the distribution of 'Simplify Probate'. I'd
vote for it. I think we can do without Wills and Probate. If a Player
wants eir assets distributed a certain way on leaving the game, that is
easy enough to organize by a variety of other means.

I'll even contribute 0.5 P-Notes towards raising its Priority in the
direction of the Bar Height.

Then why didn't you oppose the Herald's Privilege?  The above option is still
available to all Players.  The Herald can exercise this option only once a month,

Radical Proposals will not be objected to?  I know you're not that
naive, Steve, so I can only assume you're grandstanding.

Oh, the withering pressure!  I objected to "Simplify Probate" and
I can barely stand the torment I've been through since!  The one
message from the General asking me why I objected was almost too
much to bear!  And the rest...oh, well, actually, that's all there
was.  But I'm sure it's just a matter of time before hooded Agorans
come to my home to lynch me!

Poppycock.  Summary Adoption does not mean that costs cannot be
imposed on getting Proposals adopted; it just means that those costs
are not dictated by Rule.  It's entirely possible that controversial
Proposals could be adopted summarily by Players entering into an 
agreement not to object, and I should expect that such agreements
would not come at no cost.  

What I don't understand is why you believe that political costs are
not costs, or why you think that all costs need to be representable in
VTs, P-Notes, and Indulgences.  I think you've lost sight of the
forest for the trees.  Summary Adoption creates a very valuable
commodity (agreements not to object) which can be bargained for, and
yet you oppose them?  Why?

"When a Soldier with one or more recruits <Sarge> is promoted or discharged,
 eir recruit with the longest term of service becomes a recruit of Sarge's
 former CO, ceases to be anyone's CO, then becomes the CO of all the rest of
 Sarge's former recruits."

Add to "Recruitment":

(4) No Soldier of lower Rank is eligible to recruit.

Protoproposal Chaos63 [rev. 10]

Let the Promotor Exercise Judgment

Be it resolved, that Rule 1483 be amended to read:

      (a) A Proposal is any document clearly marked as such.

      (b) A Proposal is Proposed when it is posted by a Proposing
          Entity to the Public Forum with the clear indication that it
          is being posted for the purpose of Proposing it.

      (c) A Proposal is not Proposed if, in the Promotor's judgment,
          it is substantially identical to another Proposal Proposed
          within the past three weeks, unless
        (1) the Proposing Entity posting the Proposal clearly
            indicates at the time of posting that the Proposal is
            intended to become a duplicate of the prior Proposal, or
        (2) the prior Proposal has been discarded or withdrawn, or has
            been distributed and the results of voting upon that
            Proposal have been announced by the Assessor.

      (d) The Promotor's determination that a Proposal has or has not
          been Proposed (including a determination made under
          subdivision (c) of this Rule) is subject to judicial review
          only for abuse of discretion.

      (e) Under no circumstance shall the Promotor's distribution of
          previously undistributed Proposals constitute the submission
          of a new Proposal.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Any CFJ which alleges that an Officer made an error
          regarding a determination of fact where the Rules state that
          such determinations shall be subject to judicial review only
          for abuse of discretion lacks standing and shall be
          dismissed.  (Such CFJs, to have standing, must allege that
          the Officer in question abused discretion in making the
          disputed determination.)

      (b) This Rule takes precedence over all other Rules pertaining
          to when a CFJ has standing, and over all other Rules which
          specify when a CFJ shall be dismissed.

Protoproposal Chaos73 [rev. 5]

Standards of Proof

Be it resolved, that Rule 1575 be amended to read:

      (a) A CFJ alleging that a Player has violated a Rule or
          committed a Crime shall not be judged TRUE unless the
          evidence is sufficient to be certain of that Judgement
          beyond reasonable doubt.

      (b) In all other CFJs, the Judgement shall be consistent with
          the preponderance of the evidence at hand.

      (c) Furthermore, it is a complete defense to any accusation of a
          Crime that the Player accused, at the time e performed or
          neglected to perform the actions which constitute the Crime
          accused, reasonably believed that the circumstances were
          such that e was legally permitted to perform or neglect to
          perform those acts.  No Player shall be convicted of a Crime
          if this defense applies.

I do not see that this is essentially different from the already existing
commodity of agreements to declare Presence.

As I see the legitimate role of Summary Adoption, it is not as a way to
increase bargains and politicking, but rather as a way to pass "little"
fixes that one would not expect anyone to put money and bargaining work
into.  It is only within this framework that I am willing not to Object to
such Adoptions.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

I'm not sure why this is the only "legitimate" role for this rule. If
I attempted to Summary Adopt one of your Proposals, would you Object?
What if I offered to not Object to one of your Proposals, if you
didn't Object to one of mine? What if, by some accident, Summary
Adoption became the only way to get a Proposal passed? Would you
then Object to any fix? What if getting a Proposal distributed
required a 20 page application to be filled out? Would you then be
tempted to try Summary Adoption? I'm not sure you can
draw any reasonable line between the kinds of proposals that you would
be willing not to Object to, and those you would Object to without
consideration.

Only the Proposer of a Proposal can attempt to adopted it summarily.

The rest of your points are valid.

N/A, yes (for the sake of principle), no, no, only if I felt wicked (as I
mostly do nowadays), perhaps.

It's similar in character, but not identical.  I also note that Steve

understands.

That would be the main reason I suggested the mechanism at all.  The

I have to wonder whether your position on this matter might not be

Actually, I'm deregistering for the same reason that I got those blots.
I've been so busy that I hardly have time to play the game.  I don't really
know why I stayed registered this long.  I only reregistered to trump Swann
in his attempt at Coup d'etat and since that time my activity in the game
has been minimal to say the least.  I do intend however to continue lurking
about the lists, following the game to the extent I can.  I don't think I'll
ever lose interest in this great game.

Protoproposal Chaos70 [rev. 4]

More Sensible Amendment Numbers

Be it resolved, that Rule 1069 be amended to read:

      (a) Each Rule shall have an Amendment Number.
        (1) The Amendment Number of a new Rule, when that Rule is
            created, is zero.
        (2) The Amendment Number of each Rule existing at the time
            this version of this Rule takes effect is whatever its
            Amendment Number was under the prior version of this Rule;
            if a Rule had no Amendment Number on that version of this
            Rule, its Amendment Number is zero.
        (3) The Amendment Number of a Rule is incremented by one
            whenever a Rule Change affecting that Rule takes place.

      (b) A Rule's Amendment Number shall be displayed in Official
          copies of the Ruleset, appended to the Rule Number, and
          separated by a forward slash.  Responsibility is given to
          the Rulekeepor to accurately update Amendment Numbers.

|     (d) Amendment Numbers may be used for Official purposes and in
          Official documents to distinguish between old versions of a
          Rule and the Rule's current text.

Because I didn't want to waste VTs on a token attempt to resist a proposal

I supoprted Summary Adoption becuase it was clear to me that many small 
changes and trivial fixes were not being made, because nobody cared to
muster the political forces to get them proposed and passed. Summary 
Adoption seems to me to be a perfect way to handle those "Disinterested"
proposals which we have always had trouble with. And if we adopt a 
sensible custom of Objecting to non-trivial proposals, then it is pretty
much closed to abuse. It only takes one person to Object to stop such 
a proposal - and if you can buy-off everyone, then there's no-one left
to cry injustice.

Of course, if Steve continues his foolish practice of stubbornly 
objecting to everything in sight, then the mechanism is useless, and all
those little fixes will remain undone, until the ruleset is a hopeless
mess.

I agree with this policy. If it wasn't trivially easy to work around,
I would propose an amendment to Summary Adoption that made it impossible
to attempt to Summarily Adopt a given proposal twice.
