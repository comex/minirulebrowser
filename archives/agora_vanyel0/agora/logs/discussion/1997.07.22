What purpose would that serve?  As Chancellor I would have to satisfy
those Orders (creating Indulgences to do so, if necessary) or face
Persistent Debt Infractions.  I won't allow that to happen.  Such
Payment Orders would be satisfied as quickly as I can manage it.

So then we are left with a situation where the only way to handle this is
to create an exception for the Bank in the form of a new Entity or Property
which applies only to the Bank in cases where there are more Indulgences
than there should be. *sigh*

Um, question: why is the Bank capable of Persistent Debt, and why would the
penalty go to the Chancellor, should it go into it? Does that have a purpose?

Or to consider a different mechanism for distributing Indulgences
altogether.  Something like:

      At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Herald shall distribute
      amongst all Active Players a number of Indulgences equal to the
      total of the amounts of all Payment Orders in Indulgences for
      which the Bank is the payee executed in the past Nomic Week,
      less the amounts of all Payment Orders in Indulgences for which
      the Bank is the payee vacated in the past Nomic Week, and less
      any negative amount carried forward from the prior week.  This
      distribution shall be accomplished by, for each Indulgence to be
      distributed, selecting a random Active Player and paying out one
      Indulgence to that Player.  If the amount above is negative, the
      Herald shall not distribute any Indulgences, and shall instead
      carry this negative quantity forward to the next week's
      calculation.

(I know, ugly.  It can be worked on.)

Chaos> Um, question: why is the Bank capable of Persistent Debt, and

Because not having the Bank capable would amount to an exception.  The
penalty goes to the Chancellor because the Chancellor is the Bank's
Executor.  (The price you pay for power, I suppose.)

Hmmm, that just might work. I'll have to fiddle with it some -- I'll think
about it more closely for tomorrow. Right now I need to get some sleep or

You realize, of course, that after the Bank commits such an error, assuming
the Chancellor is not able to obtain the neccesary Indulgences, e will get
socked with *two* Blots the next week, and each week following that,
because of eir own debt *and* the Bank's?

Your point about mapping the conceptual boundaries of Agoran Entities
onto physical boundaries (of some physical medium of representation)
is an interesting one. It is certainly true that numbers stored in
files are not precisely analagous to poker chips: the difference
between '4' and '5' is not a difference between there being four of
something and there being five of something. I suppose that
ultimately the difference between a file which records my VT balance
as 4 and one which records it as 5 is underwritten by the different
ways in which those numbers will be used: I'll be able to cast 4
votes, but not 5. That's only to speak of the difference for us as
game players, of course. There also the matter of the difference it
makes to a computer executing a program, which are ultimately
underwritten by the physical differences in the binary representations 
(and hence in whatever medium of physical memory the computer is
using) of the two numbers. To say more about the differences between
numbers in files and poker chips would be to lead us into the murky
waters of the philosophical literature on the analog/digital and
discrete/continuous distinctions, and my head is hurting enough as it
is.  

However, none of that should blind us to the fact that numbers in
files and poker chips still share the important property of being
physical things. And couldn't the same points you make above be
made with respect to the difference between using poker chips and
using plastic money?

So what? That's the same as saying that some manipulations of Monopoly
Entities do not correspond to movements of Monopoly money. Depending on
what you mean by 'correspond', that claim is either false, or trivially
true, but uninteresting. Consider the Monopoly rule that a player who
passes Go collects $200. I think that rule is pretty much analogous
to one of our Rules which automatically changes Currency holdings at
the start of a Nomic week, as our Salary Rules used to do before PC.

Of course, simply having the rule there does not magically result
in $200 making its way from the Bank to the Monopoly player: some
person, probably the banker or the player, is going to have to perform
some physical action of transferring plastic money from the bank to
the player who has just passed passed Go. And similarly, simply having
the old Salary Rule (1007/11, I think) did not mean that any numbers
in files actually got changed: the Assessor had to do that. In each
case, the rule licenses some person to perform some physical action
(transferring pastic banknotes, changing numbers in files) which will
count as legal in virtue of the rule's having licensed. So I maintain
the basic similarity between Monopoly and Agora in this respect.

Again, so what? We could play a Monopoly variant with a similar rule,
eg instead of receiving $200 when passing Go, a player receives $50,
or $100, $150, or $200, each with a probability of one quarter. If the
actual number of Kudos transferred in your example above is unknowable
(but why is that, precisely? Can't we just roll a dice?), then the amount
of money received by the player from the bank is unknowable, too.
But what objectionable consequences are supposed to follow from this
I don't yet see. No doubt you will soon enlighten me.

That's ok as long as you consistently refuse to identify such Nomic
Entities as Rules, Proposals, SLCs, Applications etc with bodies of
text - which, unfortunately for this suggestion, I think there is
a strong temptation, and good reason, to do.

I am sceptical about a simple reintroduction of this mint
authority. All of Morendil's Mint Manipulation is based not on a
loophole in the PC rules, but on a hole that resides at least partly
in the minting rules: That a player can create nomic entities with any
names e wants, and that via a suitable naming conflict this can mess
up the results of proposals which are just being voted on. Such
attacks are possible against all proposals that introduce new nomic
entities, and they remain so now (wonder what Morendil will mint next
... :)

Of course, refusing players mint authority is useless to prevent
further scams like the MMM, as long as groups' executors still have
that power. 

But as a response to the MMM something somewhere has to be changed. I
would prefer this change to happen in the naming and/or definition of
nomic entities, but still I feel we should solve this first before we
restore minting rights. So I would suggest the opposite regulation for
a first cleanup: deny minting rights to groups as well as players.

I am feeling a bit uncomfortable because we are so slow to react to
Morendil's Mint Manipulation and the issues raised in that context. 

What about the existence of P-notes, for example? Is there a good
reason why nobody has called a CFJ on that? If yes, please let me
know, if no, I'll submit one, I guess. _If_ there is trouble, I think
we'd better find out soon, otherwise the number of reports and
transactions that will be found to be illegal will grow too much.

I agree - I am not sure why some people are so intent of identifying
such entities with bodies of text. This raises all the problems about
the "existence without the rules" etc, especially for the Transfer and
Payment Orders of PC. 

By the way, IMHO in the case of _implicit_ Transfer Orders, eg in
voting, the associated body of text will be hard to find - as I
understand the new phrasing of 1442, a message for voting only needs
to include the votes and nothing else. VTs, Transfer orders or
anything alse connected with paying the VT cost of voting does not
have to be mentioned at all. This seems to me the best example of such
a nomic entity not connected with a body of text.

Much of the success Morendil's Mint Manipulation hinges on the naming
issue - the identity of names is the only (potential) connection
between the currencies e minted and the entities created by PC. 

So I checked the use of some terms in PC again.

Four terms occur. "Payment Orders" and "Transfer Orders" are
explicitly defined by the rules, as "an order requiring ..." in 1696
and 1598. Note that these definitions use "order" with a small
"o". This seems to make it clear that in this context "order" (o) is
just the English word you could look up in the dictionary, not an
entity defined by the Agora rules.

In fact, there isn't even a definition of "Order" (capital "O")
anywhere, either. When this term appears alone, it is only as a rather
obvious shorthand for either "Transfer Order" or "Payment Order",
e.g. in 1596, 1598, 1599, 1730 and 1734.

I think this is clear enough now, so Morendil's creating "Orders" as a
separate curency was a kind of overkill. But nevertheless I would like
to propose an amendment of these rules that expands the shorthand with
the full "Transfer" or "Payment" Order as appropriate, if ther are no
serious objections to that.

I found it a little embarassing to see in the last Ambassador's report
that Internomic, while now a player in Internomic, is not voting at
all. 

Therefore I'd like to suggest the following proto:

###
InterNomic will try to vote on every proposal 24 hours before the
end of the voting period of the proposal. 

InterNomic's vote will be determined at the time InterNomic tries to
vote, according to the following rules:

i) If at the time InterNomic tries to vote more voting members of
Internomic have voted for the proposal than against it, InterNomic
will vote for the proposal.

ii) If at the time InterNomic tries to vote more voting members of
Internomic have voted against the proposal than for it, InterNomic
will vote against the proposal.

iii) If neither i) nor ii) applies, InterNomic will not vote on the
proposal. 

This vote from InterNomic is automatic. Its outcome shall be
determined by the moderator. This vote is a valid vote. 

The last paragraph of this rules takes precedence over any other rule
defining the validity of a vote.
###

Remarks: 

- Note that 309 (voting period ends before the full two weeks'
time if all nomics have voted) cannot stop InterNomic from voting. In
fact, at the moment, with InterNomic eligible to vote but not doing
so, the second sentence of 309 never applies at all.

- The last two paragraphs are needed because 332 does not make it
clear who will actually cast a valid vote (= send a message to the
moderator according to 207) for InterNomic.

- The time when Internomic votes could be earlier as a reward for
other nomics that vote early - what do you think?

Ooops, you want to watch this. If you take this interpretation the
whole carefully constructed edifice of the refutation to my arguments
re POs and TOs as Nomic Entities tumbles down. :)

The way this is intended to be interpreted is, naturally, legal deeming.
For the purposes of Currency Transfers a Voting message is declared to
be legally equivalent to "H. Assessor, please note that I pay for this
Vote by transferring N VTs to the Bank". This is what 'implicit' Transfer
Order means. You Voting message _is_ an 'order' in 1598's acceptation
of the term. (Note though that this is largely supported by Game Custom,
though whether Game Custom remains relevant in the face of such a large
change is debatable.)

You want to look up Rule 754. Capitalization does not matter at all
in legal communications - it's just a frill Rule authors use to attract
attention to what they think is important, and that is used in n-d to
distinguish between references to NEs and real-life entities of the
same names. It can't be used as the basis for an argument against any
consequences that might or might not arise from two entities having
the same name. IOW, an Order is also an order and might or might
not be an order (or an Order). ;)

>>You want to look up Rule 754. Capitalization does not matter at all

The capitalization is only what made me notice this point. My argument
does not rest on it. All I am saying is that the word order (o or O,
never mind) used in the definitions of POs and TOs in 1596 and 1598 is
just the English word, not e reference to a nomic entity. Why? Because
the definitions are clear and working this way, and because there is
no explicit definition of an "order" per se anywhere.

Later "Orders" is used as a shorthand. At least that is how it is
meant; you may argue that this is not unambiguously clear from the
rules, and that is why I would like to change this, expanding the
shorthand to the full phrases "Transfer" or "Payment" Orders.

I think this is only nitpicking a minor point, but I still don't see
why the "Orders" of PC should be considered an independent nomic
entity (or class of ne's) - of course the currency "Orders" you
created are an ne, but the conflict with PCs comes from your POs and
TOs only and would not be different had you not created any "Orders".

Well, so be it :) I'm not sure I have yet seen a clear strategy to

situation that lets your manipulations succeed, at least partially,
than some improvised arguing around your points that only messes up
many other concepts involved. 

>>The way this is intended to be interpreted is, naturally, legal deeming.
For the purposes of Currency Transfers a Voting message is declared to
be legally equivalent to "H. Assessor, please note that I pay for this
Vote by transferring N VTs to the Bank". This is what 'implicit' Transfer
Order means. You Voting message _is_ an 'order' in 1598's acceptation
of the term.<<

I agree completely. But I still don't see the "body of text" that
constitutes the TO. The TO only exists because the rules create it at
the time I send the message with my votes. That's exactly the point
I'm trying to make.

Implicit Transfer Orders are quite clearly connected with messages.

General Chaos:
>>Yes, I object.  Why is it necessary?

You may consider it nitpicking, but the reason is that in my opinion
there is no need to have three categories of orders, "Orders" in
general, "Transfer Orders" and "Payment Orders". And as I see it
at the moment we do not have them, either, at least not based on
PC (Morendil created currencies with all three names, of course).

Why did Morendil create three currencies, then, including one
called just "Orders"? When I tried to check this I realized that
PC does not create or define any "Orders", it uses the word
a) to define POs and TOs (but there, 1596 and 1598, "order" does
not stand for  a - nomic or other - entity defined anywhere, but
just for the English noun).
b) as a shorthand for "Transfer" or "Payment" Order. If this
shorthand use is avoided, as I suggested, then Morendil's 
manipulation is not destroyed, but at least the nitpicking
point is made that eir creation of a third currency ("Orders") was
unnecessary for the success of eir scheme.

If you disagree, would you say that PC does create "Orders" in
addition to "Transfer Orders" and "Payment Orders"? If yes, why, and
what are they good for? If no, what is the system that decided when
the rules use shorthand and when they spell out "Transfer" or
"Payment" Orders? If it is merely to save space, shorthand could have
been used more often. If there are other reasons, they have escaped me
so far (not that it would surprize me very much :)

The Voting message you send to the Assessor is that body of text.

There aren't three categories of "orders".  There's two.  Frankly, the
present use of "Order" as an short form for either Transfer Order or
Payment Order is crystal clear in every context in which it appears.
I see no point in adding unnecessary words to an already overlong
Ruleset.

I do not consider the off whims of Agora's Least Honorable Citizen to
be indicative of any legislative need.  I presume that he created the
"Orders" Currency because he misapprehended the need to do so in order
to further his nefarious goal of world confusion, or whatever the hell
he's doing over there.  Or maybe he thought doing so would create more
confusion.  I have no idea.  Can't trust those Frenchmen, nosiree.

Shrug.  Again, I don't see the point.  And I don't ascribe to
nitpicking for its own sake, which is what I see this as being.

Klaus> If you disagree, would you say that PC does create "Orders" in

It doesn't create any of them.  It _defines_ Transfer Orders and
Payment Orders, and occasionally uses Orders as a shorthand reference,
when the context is clear.

Perhaps so.  I wrote this proposal over the course of several months,
and I don't guarantee that my state of mind was constant throughout
the entire time I worked on it.

I think if we spent less time picking nonexistent nits and spent more
time on the obvious, commonsense interpretation of the Rules, we'd be
less confused, and have shorter Rules to boot.

Morendil:
>>The Voting message you send to the Assessor is that body of text.

That's the obvious answer, of course, but I wouldn't dwell on
this point if I liked this answer. Yes, a voting message is a
body of text, and it does have something to do with the connected
implicit TO. 

But "has something to do with" is different from "constitutes".  Ok, a
proposal may be constituted by the text that lists the proposal. But
the TO connected with a vote is created by rule 1442 (and note that
the implicit creation of a TO must be expressly permitted by a rule,
see 1731). In fact, 1442 says that the implicit TO submission is
included in the _act of informing the Assessor of the vote cast_ - it
is not created by a suitable redefinition of terms, as you wrote
earlier:

Morendil:
>>> For the purposes of Currency Transfers a Voting message is declared to
> be legally equivalent to "H. Assessor, please note that I pay for this
> Vote by transferring N VTs to the Bank". This is what 'implicit' Transfer
> Order means. <<

Tu summarize: The possibility to connect items like proposals, rules,
TOs etc with bodies of text has been used in descriptions of the
"entitiness" of such items. Others have mentioned that these items can
cease to be Nomic Entities without ceasing to be connected to bodies
of text; I still insist that items like TOs or POs may be created
implicitly by the _act_ of making or communicating a body of text, but
they are definitely distinct from this body of text. So the connection
"Nomic Entitiness" <--> "Body of text" does not work.

I am not saying this with any particular consequences or applications
in mind, I am just trying to get a clear idea of what is going on.

General Chaos:
>>I think we are way too deeply concerned with "entitiness".  It is
pointless, to me, to dwell on whether or not something is an entity.<<

I am afraid I was sloppy here, I meant "Nomic Entitiness" or
whatever. And my interest is not general or theoretical. The only
reason I am thinking about this is that it may be relevant for a
confirmation or refuting of Morendil's Mint Manipulation. 

One strategy suggested for refuting it was that for some reason or
other POs and TOs are not Nomic entities after all, so they and their
names are not governed by 1586. It is the validity of this strategy
that I am interested in, not some general philosophizing.

General Chaos:
>>I ask you: in your opinion, what is the status of unsubmitted Transfer
Orders?  Do they exist, or not?  Why?<<

I would not be interested in that question at all - except that under
eir scheme Morendil might say that the answer to your question depends
on whether e, as the mintor of these objects, has made any or
not. That's the only interesting aspect of the question, and it
depends, of course, on whether Morendil's scheme works or not.

General Chaos:
>>I am becoming more and more convinced that the entire "Nomic Entity"
concept is a very bad one, and one which should be jettisoned from the
game entirely.<<

I tend to agree - the concept seems very abstract and somewhat
unmotivated to a newcomer like me. However, I thought it might have
been introduced to close some loopholes you found - in that case a
replacement would be needed.

I would be very happy to follow your concept of looking at the
commonsense interpretation of rules, instead of, well, nitpicking and
hairsplitting, or put more politely, looking at details, literal
meanings and hidden loopholes due to weird rules interpretations. Why
aren't you all doing that all the time, anyway?

You could argue that every Payment Order owes its existence to the
Rules because it was created in reponse to a Rule-based requirement
for its creation.  However, I don't think this is a reasonable
argument.  The more I look at and think about the Nomic Entity Rule,
the more convinced I am that there are no Nomic Entities at all,
except perhaps for those entities which are deemed to exist, such as
the Frankenstein Monster.  IMO, Voting Tokens are not a Nomic Entity,
because I could choose to continue to maintain records of Voting
Tokens even if the Rules which "define" them were repealed; their
existence would continue.  I believe Steve has expounded at length on
the actual existence of the myriad of supposedly abstract objects that
comprise Agora, and I am in substantial agreement with Steve on these
issues.  

Of course, under this particular conceptualization of existence, the
entire Nomic Entity concept falls apart as almost wholly devoid of
meaning.  Oh well.

Klaus> I tend to agree - the concept seems very abstract and somewhat

There is, I believe, a deep and fundamental conflict between myself
and several of my fellow Players (most notably, Chuck and Oerjan) as
to the nature of the Rules.  I deny that the Rules have any
generalized power to create, modify, or destroy entities.  In my
opinion, the Rules are limited to creating constraints on the
activities of Players.  The power to create, modify, and destroy
entities lies with Players.  When a Rule states that such and such an
entity is created, it means that this entity has a legal existence,
but not necessarily an actual existence.  Voting Tokens exist because
I and other maintain records of their existence; I do so because I am
required to do so; others do so (or may do so) to insure that I
execute my duties properly and faithfully.  Voting Tokens, and the
records maintained of them, have legal significance because the Rules
specify that they do.  Their existence is not predicated by their
legal significance, and their legal significance is not predicated by
their existence.  It would be most inconvenient to have legal
significance granted to something that did not exist, admittedly, but
it is possible.

I don't believe that a "weird rules interpretation" should be admitted
unless all less weird interpretations are demonstrably meaningless or
contradictory.  This is part of what I mean by using "common sense".
This does not in any way rule out hairsplitting or nitpicking, but it
does rule out creating hairs to split and nits to pick out of thin
air.

Actually, the strategy (mine) suggested that Morendil's currencies are not
Nomic Entities.  This is based on a strict interpretation of "only existing by
virtue of the Rules defining it to exist".  It doesn't really have anything to
do with bodies of text and their relationship to Nomic Entities.  It has to do
with the fact that there are no Rules that directly define the existence of
Morendil's currencies.  IMO, the classes defined by PC (POs and TOs) *are*
Nomic Entities.  The discussion about bodies of text is relevant to whether
specific instances of POs and TOs are also Nomic Entities, but, as has been
pointed out, they don't have names anyway 8).

A very Pragmatic thing to say.  As a Platonist, of course, I
would argue that Voting Tokens are entities distinct from your
records of them.

Oh boy - the newbie is really getting under your nails, uh ? Or is it

Whichever it is, do mind your blood pressure, there's a good fellow.

Who said anything about having to like it ? It's the only answer you're
going to get that is consistent with all Transfer Orders being 'orders'
in the normal, non-overloaded meaning of the term. Game Custom is even
consistent with this use, since starting with the VT Reform we have 
been taking "I hereby Vote FOR" to mean "I hereby Vote FOR, spending
one VT to do so". Which is in fact the main reason why I haven't been
particularly interested in implicit TOs during the Currency-Orders
discussion.

I'm not saying your interpretation is unreasonable, mind you. I'm
saying that the other one is the politically fashionable one. :)

Maybe you should CFJ. My point was that instances of Nomic Entities
that answer to the name "Transfer Orders" may only be created under
particular circumstances which will likely conflict with 1442 if it
is so interpreted.

Yes, and as someone in between the extremes, I would argue that the class named
Voting Tokens is a Nomic Entity, but the individual instances of them may not
be, depending on whether you grant them a physical existence via their records
or not.

I tend not to think as much about entity classes; after all, entity
classes can be constructed arbitrarily by anyone at any time.  The
definition of a specific entity class in the Rules is, to me, an
artifice of law, serving only to aid in expressing the law, and not
actually creating any "entity" of any sort.  The ability to group
entities into classes is epiphenomenal of the qualities of the members
of the class; the class is defined by the entities comprising it,
rather than the other way around.

I agree with this, except that when the Rules define a class I would say the
Rules have defined/created *something* and to me it is natural to think of that
something as an entity - to me "entity" just means something that has
existence.  The fact that it is just an artifice of law does not deprive it of
its existence and therefore, IMO, does not prevent it from being an entity.  I
would disagree with the idea that a class has no existence unless actual
instances of that class exist.

Except that it is, IMHO, stretching the analogy with poker chips much too far. 
The above is, as you would say, a trivially true but wholly uninteresting 
observation; of course they are.

Your "metaphysical manifesto" has at its core the claim that the relationship 
between Monopoly entities and Monopoly chips is basically the same as the one 
that underlies Nomic entities and an unspecified class of physical 'tokens'. I 
dispute this claim mainly because I see no way that the physical tokens that 
are manipulated in Agora can be meaningfully viewed as equivalent to poker 
chip-like entities, which are largish, discrete, form an easily identified set, 
and so on.

You state that it is equivalent to stand up in a Monopoly game and shout, "I
receive one 100-dollar bill", and post to the PF a message stating "I receive
1 VT from the Bank". Well, that's where I disagree - it's not equivalent,
because the former is a physical manipulation to which the Monopoly tokens are
entirely impervious; just standing around shouting silly things is not going
to move no poker chips around. Whereas _all_ manipulations of physical
entities that are relevant to our playing Agora consist of sending messages of
one sort or another, and it is a very difficult matter to tell which of these 
manipulations are legal and which are not.

I think this gets into an orthogonal issue, actually.  Or perhaps not;
it seems that the entire Platonic viewpoint is untenable if you do not
grant the Rules power to create entities on its own.

Well, there's the rub. Defining and creating are completely different
things. It's like the difference between me saying "An ice cream sundae is
a dessert consisting of ice cream topped with chocolate sauce, whipped
cream, nuts, and/or other toppings" and actually going downstairs and
dishing myself out one. In this case, I agree with Scott -- the Rules may
very well define something, but they don't just bring it into existence.

Scott isn't saying that they aren't entities, AFAICT -- he's arguing that
abstract things can be entities whether or not the Rules describe them or not.

You're missing the point: even though, say, "H. Assessor, I hereby vote FOR
Proposal 9999" does not specifically mention anything about the transfer of
VTs, it is still a body of text which is a TO because the existence of that
particular text, whatever it might mean in "plain English," within the body
causes it to transfer a VT.

If we decide to do so, it's easy to fix this without actually getting rid
of Mint Authority for Players and Groups -- just make it an action Without

Actually, I agree with this, somewhat. As this whole fiasco has indicated
to us, the concept of a Nomic Entity often seems to be more trouble than
it's worth. So, I ask: what are the advantages of having the concept of
"Nomic Entity"?

I don't see the difference. The only reason it is more difficult to
determine the legality of such posts in Agora is because the Rules
regarding money in Agora are far more complex. Should you successfully
convince the Recordkeepor that you should actually receive that 1 VT, even
if the Rules don't say so, you *will.* In Monopoly, if you convince the
other players that the rules would have given you that $100, even if in
reality they don't, you still would get the $100.

Actually that's not quite right - the Implicit TO Rules in fact dictate that
such a message should be considered to be a request of the Assessor to record
a delayed transfer of one VT from the Player casting a Vote to the Bank (and,
in fact, additionally the submission of a request that any previous such TOs
should be vacated). The voting message itself doesn't _cause_ a transfer, it is
deemed to be equivalent to _requiring_ one, a subtle distinction.

Naaah, get real - considered as an economic game, Agora doesn't even approach
the complexity of Monopoly. The Rules governing the recordkeeping are more
complex, mostly because they're rooted in the Rules for Currencies, Officers,
CFJs, &c. - but there are far fewer events in Agora that cause transfer than 
there are in Monopoly.

I certainly don't agree with that. I don't only have to convince the Assessor,
I have to convince every Player, plus everyone who might at some future time be
a Player and has access to the game's records, and also I have to cover my
tracks entirely and eradicate every trace of the actual, legal, Game State
from every file wherein it's recorded - and these files are duplicated all
over the world.

Steve would probably say that there is it merely a difference of magnitude
between the task of illegally stealing one VT from the Bank and stealing $100
from a Monopoly Bank, but I disagree - precisely because in Monopoly, the 
'records' are the chips and notes themselves, and there is IMHO a world of 
difference between large-scale, discrete objects such as chips and notes and 
widespread, fuzzy collections of small objects such as the one that comprise 
our 'records' of the Game State.

But transfers in Monopoly are easily trackable. On your turn, you ask a few
questions. Did you land on someone else's property? Did you land on Chance
or Community Chest? Did you land on Free Parking? Did you pass Go? Did you
mortgage any Property? They're all directly related to the game actions you
have performed on your turn. In Agora, transfers and requirements to make
transfers occur at any time, and because of the semi-automated nature of
the game, are much more difficult to track and record.

It's not nearly as hard as all that. You convince the Assessor e's somehow
made a mistake in totalling, reporting, &c. your number of VTs. If e's
convinced, e'll admit a COE about it and you get the money. Only if anyone
else raises an issue do you need to convince anyone else.
