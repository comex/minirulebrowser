But don't you see that this is a natural part of the economy - for the
less wealthy to envy the wealthy and try to hinder their accumulation
of wealth? It's a curious paradox of nomic, that you can construct a
system whose natural outcome is the deconstruction of that system.

My advice to you is play along with it! You are rich - use your riches
to protect your riches. As long as I am poor, I will play the part of
a poor person, and may be forced to struggle against you. That's what
the game is about! That's why I pushed for an economy in the first place.

You've got it easy in one sense - at least your meta-level and your
role-playing interests coincide. I am at a disadvantage, because it is
in my best interests as a role-player to resist the economy, but in my
interests as a meta-gamer to keep it in place, so that I can continue
to enjoy the role-play.

Except that I am not rich, because every time I get a little bit rich,
the Equalizers go "Oh dear, the economy is out of balance, we must fix
this immediately" and once again level the economy.  At this point, I
am convinced that the political climate here is such that an economy
is pointless because political forces will destroy a nascent economy
faster than it can grow to fruition.

I disagree, obviously, or I wouldn't have asked the question.  In
fact, I think it's rather ridiculous of you to dismiss my question in
that manner; you are presuming that everyone shares your particular
vision of the best future of Agora.

You have that concern, true; I do not.  My opinion is that if
Indulgences become plentiful, we should, instead of confiscating them,
increase the demand for them in some other way (i.e. raise
penalties).  The major problem I see with your approach to economic
management is that it's too crude.  I think you've also failed to come
to terms with the fact that every economy contains unstable elements
and imbalances, if for no other reason than the costs imposed by the
lack of imperfect information.

I disagree that it was wildly imbalanced.

Scott,

I hope you're not getting _too_ paranoid about our unwillingness to
bear the existence of rich players. For example, for quite some time
now, at least two months IIRC, Steve has been very wealthy both in VT
and P-notes, and he dominated the proposal queue and the votes on
proposals. Nobody was worried by this, and noone took his VTs away.

That you are now losing your indulgences should, IMHO, be considered
as part of the successful revolution that occurred some weeks ago. And
if anything should ever hurt rich people, then it should be
revolutions.

(Not to mention the fact that in contrast to VTs and P-notes, becoming
rich in indulgences is a matter of shear luck...)

But the whloe point of indulgences and blots is that there are just
not enough indulgences around to satisfy all existing blots. This was
the case before the revolution, and I agree that the "imbalance" of
the distributions of blots and indulgences before the revolution
wasn't really an imbalance, but a natural outcome of how our economy
works. 

But the post-revolution blot amnesty created an artificial imbalance
with a mechanism I would expect you to oppose on principal reasons
(see above) - why you should want such mechanisms to lead to unwanted
imbalancing effects in addition to the wanted (tinkering level)
effects I don't understand.

Scott, it may be time for you to form a Small Government Party. :) Of
course, there would be appreciable irony in the existence of such a
party within a game exclusively obsessed with government. Kind of like
the "Abolish the Australian Capital Territory Legislature Party" that
has a seat in the Australian Capital Territroy legislature.

Not at all, Scott, not at all. The above is, as indicated, merely what
*I* think. Of course, the arguments I give in my posts are generally
intended to persuade people to think as I do, just as the arguments you
give in your posts are intended to persuade people to think as you do -
but that's politics, right? We find out at the ballot box who did a
better job of persuading. (Actually, it occurs to me that not all of
the arguments I give in my posts are intended to persuade: some are
intended simply to articulate my own view of the game, without a strong
expectation that others should share it.)

But, anyway, thank god for disagreement, eh? If we didn't have it, then
where would we be? So, here's to you, Scott - grouchy, terse and
irascible, I wouldn't change a hair on your head - long may we disagree
(in between stints of working together). Cheers.

Fondly, 

Steve

I'm generally relatively wealthy, because I'm generally pretty Active: I
make a lot of Proposals, and work hard to make sure they pass, and I've
held many Offices (and I get a nice stipend for being Distributor), so I
have VTs. But I've used this influential position to introduce most of
the measures (taxes et al.) to which Scott objects as "soaking the
rich". Why? Because I recognize that (at least for me) there's no point
in being so wealthy compared to other Players that wealth loses all
meaning for me. That might be an understandable aim to have in real life
(although it's not one I have in real life either), but to me it really
makes no sense at all here in the context of playing a game. I *want* to
have to make hard decisions about VT expenditure; those are the kinds of
tough decisions I find enjoyable.

If I found a loophole in the Rules tomorrow that would give me 1000 VTs,
would I exploit it? Well yes, I certainly would: but only for the
pleasure of executing a scam. I wouldn't expect, nor would I
particularly want, to be able to hold on to my winnings. This is in fact
more or less what happened back in 1996 when Crito exploited the bug in
the 'Win by Proposal' Rule (since repealed) to win about 600 times, with
a 10 VT bonus per Win. It wasn't my scam, but I got a cut (about 2000
VTs) - the price of my silence and co-operation. I enjoyed the politics
and the backroom dealing - and when it was all over, I crafted, and
shepherded through the legislature, 'Restore Game Balance', to relieve me
(and Crito and Jeff) of 90% of my wealth. It was patently obvious that
VTs could have no meaning while there were 7000 of them in circulation.

>(Not to mention the fact that in contrast to VTs and P-notes, becoming
>rich in indulgences is a matter of shear luck...)

Not quite, or not only, sheer luck - you also have to stay out of
trouble, particularly FtR trouble.

Of course not.  Steve tends to be the architect of wealth-reduction
schemes, so it stands to reason that he would refrain from creating
one which would principally injure his own wealth (unless doing so
would injure another's wealth even more).

But it should be noted that I was one of the rebels.  If anything, I

And also a matter of not doing anything culpable.  (Which I achieve
mainly by virtue of not doing anything.)

Whoa.  I don't see this at all.  Could you expand on this argument?
In fact, I think my stance is entirely opposite to this.  The erasure
of blots due to revolution is akin to abrogating debts in bankruptcy,
which does in fact create inflation in real economies (the LS monetary
model that Steve pointed me to some years ago seems to assert that
monetary inflation in a closed system is primary or entirely caused by
loan failures).  I think Steve's goal of having a balanced,
inflationless economy is completely unreachable, and as long as he
seeks to attain it we will be barraged with constant adjustments
necessitated only by his failure to admit that no economy can do what
he expects.

This is not necessary for there to be trade in indulgences.  All that
is required is that there be Players who need more indulgences than
they have.  It is not necessary that the economy _as a whole_ be
critically scarce; that just raises need to the level of desparation.
In fact, I personally think that enforcing desparation on at least one
unlucky Player is cruel and pointless.

That brings to mind an idea that I had.  Perhaps the successful rebels
should handle their blots by seizing the Indulgences of the non-rebels.  Of
course the non-rebels may not have enough Indulgences to cover the Blots but
that just makes things more interesting.
