I think the current "Nomic Entity" idea existed to prevent arbitrary
modifications to the game, by making Nomic Entities immune from the
corrosive effects of 116.  

What may be needed is a jettison of the term, and a reweite of the rules
so that Entities (of any sort) that the Rules claim jurisdiction
over cannot be legally manipulated in ways other than provided for in
the rules.  The idea of a special place for entities created "solely by
the Rules" (however you define it) should be completly orthoginal to
the question of how we want 116 to apply to it.

What about using new Nomic Properties (e.g. "Playerhood") in place of Nomic
Entitiness?  For the purpose of Rule 1586, certain Nomic Properties could
be defined as Important, and an entity which loses an Important NP loses all
its NPs (except as stated otherwise).

[I can just see someone minting a Currency named "Nomic Properties", or at
 least attempting to do so for eir own amusement.]

The TO exists as something separate from the voting message, it was

I like that idea very much. It would be sad to abolish mint authority
for playrs just because it can be abused. Action Without Objection
might give a bit too much power to other players to prevent mintings
that are non-abusive, but still introduce some effect that is
unpleasant for some players.

What about giving some control over this to relevant officers like the
Chancellor? Like an "Action without objection by the Chancellor"? 

We might also want to give such an officer the possibility to stop
abuse after the creation of anew currency; if we don't, new scams will
just include the new challenge to hide the intended results long
enough to get the creation through. Or some payers might get paranoid
and just object to any new currency that is not abviously harmless and
boring. So the Chancellor may have the power to command the destruction
or at least a change of properties of privately minted currencies.

That would also give an office some real power in addition to record
keeping tasks.

Yes, that's the difference between defining a class and creating a specific
instance of that class.  What I'm saying is, when the Rules define a class of
entities, they have brought something into existence - a new class.  And that
class is thus an entity.

Well, I apologize if I have misunderstood Scott, but AFAICT he *is* arguing
that a class is not an entity (and therefore it is irrelevant to discuss
whether or not it is a *Nomic* Entity).  But of course Scott can speak for
emself here.  8)

I am not necessarily arguing that classes are not entities.  Rather, I
am arguing that classes are too nebulous to be discussed in the same
manner as other, less abstract entities, which I shall call "objects",
for the lack of a better word.  My main point of contention is that
classes don't have properties of their own (except for trivial ones
like names); rather, class properties are imputed from the properties
of their members.  Most, if not all, of the time, when we appear to be
assigning a property to a class entity, we are actually merely using a
shorthand to assign some property to each of the members of the class.

Of course, there can be argument as to whether an entity is a member
of a given class, but that really boils down to whether that entity
possesses the characteristics that are defining of that class, or
not.  Furthermore, creating or destroying a class in no substantial
way changes the properties of its members, since a class is nothing
more than a grouping of objects, presumably based on the presence or
absence of some distinguishable characteristic shared by the members
of that class.

Because of this substantial distinction, I believe that it does not
all that much sense to treat classes as on an equal level with
objects, nor do I believe that doing so creates any substantial
benefit in interpretation, expression, or operation of the Rules.

Good.  Thanks for the clarification.  I agree with this.  The problem here is
that the "trivial" property of class, name, is one that is important in the
current dispute about Morendil's currencies, since it is the name of eir
currencies that causes potential problems via R1586 with the classes of
entities named POs and TOs.

I agree that the distinction of Nomic Entities in the Rules probably causes
more trouble than it's worth.  However, in this case I think it happens to
provide us with a way out of problems caused by MMM (as Kolja so succinctly
names it 8).

And, I would add, how R1011 applies to it.  This is the tack I think I would
prefer, along with some provisions to avoid problems with duplicate names.

While going through the types of Entities in the Ruleset recently, I found
that almost all of them would work better as Properties. Being able to Vote
or Propose, for example, should be Properties.

The Nomic Property concept is, of course, much newer.  The Nomic
Entity concept is an outdated anachronism that deserves to be put to
rest.

Laurent> How about MUQs ?

MUQs are a consequence of the size of the individual units and the
fact that the units are atomic.  The MUQ of a currency is merely that
portion of the common name of that currency that an individual unit
comprises.  There is no functional difference between a currency whose
MUQ is 0.01 and one whose MUQ is 1, except that we call a group of 100
of the former "1" and 100 of the latter "100".

I gloss "Voting Entity" as "an entity possessing the property of being
a Voting Entity" (which sounds recursive, but isn't), and similarly
for Proposing Entity.

Neither Voting Entities nor Proposing Entities need be Nomic
Entities.  In fact, presently, no Proposing Entity is a Nomic Entity.

Except, as others have noted, the entities created by Pragmatic
Currencies are not named "Payment Orders" or "Transfer Orders"; they
are merely known by those appelations.

I am not particularily bothered by the fact that a Payment Order (the
unit of currency) is not a Payment Order (as defined by R.1596).
Stranger things have happened.
