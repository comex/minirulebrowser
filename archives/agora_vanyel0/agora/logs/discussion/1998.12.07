The MUQ of Irises was changed to 0.01 when we destroyed and recreated
this currency recently. 

When the VT reward for the Assessor was introduced, the MUQ for VTs
was also changed to 0.01 (R1695/5).

I think this is fine. The most natural way to think of Voting Periods is
as an attribute of Proposals which is fixed at the time they are
distributed. If we think of them in this way, then changing the VPs of
Proposals already distributed becomes a retroactive application of the
amendment to R693.

(One might argue that the application need not be retroactive: we might
think of the effect of the amendment as changing, in the present, the
value of the Proposals' attribute "length-of-VP". But at least in this
case, that argument won't quite work, since the effect will be to make
it the case, in the present, that the VPs ended a few days ago - and
that is a change in the past.)

When we extended the voting period from seven to ten days, I think it
was concluded that the Voting Period of a Proposal was determined when
the Proposal was distributed.  I don't remember the reasoning; I think
it had something to do with the notion that some Proposals would have
their Voting Periods reopened under the alternative interpretation.

"Most natural" is highly subjective.  Is there anything in the Rules
to support such an interpretation?  It seems to me that that is
contrary to the Rule that a Rule Change resulting from a Proposal
takes effect when the Proposal results are distributed, and of
Rule 101--that Rules, at any time, are obeyed in the form in which
they are then in effect.  If we say the VPs of these Proposals
are still ten days, aren't we obeying a former form of the Rule
rather than the current form?

I've argued against such an interpretation before.  Just becasue we are
setting a new designation of a time in the past does not mean that the change
of designation actually takes place in the past.  Analogy: a Rule stating,
"July 4 1776 is recognized as the birthday of the United States" is not
retroactive simply because it changes the designation of a date in the
past.  The designation becomes effective at the time the
Rule is enacted, not on July 4 1776, and is not retroactive simply
because it refers to a date in the past.

I think that is a poor analogy. What is involved here is more than just
reference to a date in the past. Here we are trying to determine whether
or not specific events (such as the conclusions of Voting Periods, and
the legal castings of votes) did or did not take place in the past. If
we now say that the VPs of Proposals 3810-3812 concluded on Monday, then
votes cast after that time but before the passage of P3809 which were
legally cast at the time they were cast are having their legal statuses
changed retrospectively.

To put it another way: how can it be true on Monday afternoon that the
VPs did not conclude on Monday morning, but false on Tuesday morning
that they did not conclude on Monday morning, without a retrospective
change?
