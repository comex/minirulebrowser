I made that choice, not Michael.

Ouch, what an embarassing mistake! If I had given Michael someone
else's Kudo, I'd now transfer one of mine to you. But since it was
mine anyway, I hope Michael won't mind if I correct it in the obvious
way. 

So - H. Herald take note - as a new Nomic Week has started, I hereby
transfer the misplaced Kudo from Michael to Murphy, because it was
intended for Murphy in the first place.

Well, due to my failed attempt to go on hold I unintentionally
contributed to these quorum problems (not that this made the
difference...)

But on other occasions I deliberately do not vote at all - just like
being present is a way to support a proposal without investing a VT,
not voting and hoping for failed quorum is a "cheap" way to vote
against. Or do you consider that bad style?

But IN does not have that power: Each nomic is sovereign except where it
has explicitly given up control within its own rules.
<<

Agora, for example, is quite clearly protected from such outside
attempts to change rules, in my opinion: 1322 specifies that
successful rule changes need to be due to an "instrument" with
sufficient power, and I don't see that IN rules, proposals or other IN
actions are listed as a rule changing instrument anywhere in the Agora
rules.

I don't think anyone thinks that InterNomic has the power to directly
change the Rules of any Nomic.  It does, however, have the power to
command a Member Nomic to change its Rules.  But, InterNomic's Rules
lack any sort of formal sanctions for a Nomic that fails to comply
with such a command, so InterNomic is basically powerless to enforce
such demands.

That the wish to make things happen is not sufficient for success has
nothing to do with the Rules.  It's a simple fact.  "If wishes were
fishes we'd all cast nets."

I don't recall ascribing any power to Internomic to "make things
happen".  I recall ascribing to Internomic the power to command Member
Nomics to do things.  Don't confuse commanding a thing with doing a
thing.

I don't follow what you're saying here at all.  Sorry.

I'm a bit confused.  Let's see if we can clear this up.  I'm going to quote
the rules pertaining to my arguments/discussions first, because I feel it's
more convienient to read it here than have to go look it up somewhere :)

IN Rule 101 reads as follows:
-----
All member nomics must always abide by all Internomic rules then in effect,
in the form in which they are then in effect. At the start of the first
game, rules 101-114 are immutable, and rules 201-216 are mutable.
Subsequently, the number of a rule does not indicate that rule's mutability.
-----

IN Rule 112 reads as follows:
-----
A member nomic may always withdraw from Internomic.
-----

IN Rule 214 reads as follows:
-----
All business to be conducted with a member nomic shall be conducted with
the liaison to that nomic. No entity may be liaison to more than one member
nomic. 
-----

The proposed rule reads as follows:
-----
Create a new rule reading: All terms in this Rule should be interpreted
according to Ackanomic law. The players who comprised the Organization
known as Vulcan as of August 25, 1997 are considered Internomic Fugitives.
They are forbidden from altering the Ackanomic game state in any way
whatsoever. 

This Rule becomes a part of the Acka rulset, with a number one lower than
the lowest existing rule number. 
-----

Now, it seems to me that rule 101 says that all "member nomics" must abide
by the IN rules.  That means that Ackanomic must abide by the rules.
Ackanomic is an entity which is not a player.  If the proposal passes, then
Ackanomic must add the rule to the Ackanomic ruleset, according to the new
rule.  It seems to me that the only thing that may stop that is for
Ackanomic's liason (according to rules 112 & 214) to withdraw Ackanomic
from Internomic.  It seems that 214 does not stop Ackanomic from being
forced to add the new rule to Ackanomic's ruleset since it only specifies
business and 101 already makes it clear that the nomic must abide by all of
the rules.

If, for some reason this is not the case and IN R101 is interpreted that
the member nomic (as a group of people) must abide by IN rules, then the
group who is running Ackanomic must either use eir power to create rules to
add the new IN rule into Ackanomic's ruleset (thus stripping em of all eir
power) or withdraw from IN.  Either way, it might not be a bad idea for a
player to submit a SFJ to clear this up.

It also seems that the way IN R101 is worded, it says that all member
nomics must abide by the rules of Internomic.  Does that mean that if a
nomic does not abide by the rules, it cannot be a member nomic, since if it
was, it would be abiding by the rules?  It seems to me, I remember
something like this being mentioned as something that was discussed long
ago, but I'm unsure.

If it is, then I am guilty of bad style as well.

Well, due to my failed attempt to go on hold I
unintentionally
contributed to these quorum problems (not that
this made the
difference...)

But on other occasions I deliberately do not vote
at all - just like
being present is a way to support a proposal
