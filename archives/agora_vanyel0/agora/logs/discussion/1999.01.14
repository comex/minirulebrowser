Andre, could you please announce the results of these elections soon?
I don't think any of them were actually contested, were they? I want to

I have no record of it ever reaching the Public Forum.  And I don't
think you can admit the COE since you were no longer Promotor at the
time you sought to do so.

This statement does not conform to the record as I have it.  I show

Scott,

Sounds good.  Earlier, you mentioned a "spiffy" interface for P-Note transactions.  Does
this interface work through e-mail, and if so, how?

Thanks,

Why don't we use the fresh start to put on some more tax pressure?
Like a VT circulation level of 4? A level of 8 is a white elephant of
prime quality - it will take ages until we have so much money around,
and until then all the VT tax stuff does is sit around in the
Accountor's report.

Well, I don't want to set a low circulation level just to make sure the
tax laws get exercised regularly.  How soon we might get back to 8
depends on the BOS and the Voting Tariff.  Once these are set, I'll
take a closer look at the VTCL.

For now, I'm assuming that the polity is still interested in exploring
the development of an interesting economy and 8 seemed a
reasonable average amount for being able to vote on 2 or 3
proposals a week and still have VTs left over for trades, bribes,
etc. - based on a Voting Tarriff of one.

OTOH, if there is some consensus that we need to try really
painful VT scarcity to get an interesting economy going, then
I'll acquiesce and set a painfully low VTCL.  8)

No, it requires Linux, X11R6, Gtk+ version 1.1.6, perl 5.005, and
mysql 3.22.14b-gamma and runs on my console only.  It is also closely
tied to my email archive.

I am still working on an email interface.  If I ever get a static IP
address, I may add a web interface as well.

Perhaps you and I should jointly develop a standard syntax for
specifying payment and transfer orders in email to foster automatic
recognizition of the same.

Why do we need a VTCL of 8 for this? 2-3 VTs for voting, ok. And, say,
a third of the palyers engage in trading, bribing etc (really, there
are less!). So a VTCL of 5 should be quite enough...

Come one,let's have some fun with the money stuff! ;)

Yes, I'd like that.  I currently have software already set up to track
POs and TOs, too.  But I have to enter the data into my system
manually.  It would be nice to be able to automate that part.
The biggest problem I see here is in assigning PO numbers.  We
need a standard that will allow each PO issuer the ability to assign
a unique PO number without constantly having to keep track of
PO numbers issued by other Players.  Something like, TTXXXNNNN,
where TT = type (e.g., VT, IN, or PN), XXX = unique Player initials,
NNNN = sequence number tracked by Player XXX?

Is it your wish that the R-O-M be repealed? Why?

Before I cast my vote on P3824, it'd be nice to have some kind of idea
of how effective the R-O-M has been. How many ROM Proposals have been
adopted since the ROM was created just over a year ago?

Lost, indeed. There's no record of this message in the findmail
archives.

I don't really care that much about this, actually; my system
generates internal numbers for all POs.  I can track POs that don't
have numbers provided by their issuers, which are, after all, strictly
a convenience.  If the issuer of a PO doesn't give it an identifying
number, I don't create one for it.

I have a form that let me enter a new PO or TO in under a minute; the
form system interfaces with my mail archiver so I don't have to
translate the dates by hand, which is probably the most tedious part.

Morendil has proven he sent the message. That doesn't mean you should
necessarily admit the COE. According to R1865, the way to change one's
Public Service Status to Served (and thereby avoid committing the
Infraction) is by submitting a Proposal. According to R1483, a Proposal
is created whenever an appropriate collection of text is delivered to
the Public Forum. The findmail archives contain no record of Morendil's
message; it appears that message never entered gecko's "normal technical
domain of control", and was thus never delivered to the PF.

This is not cut and dried. One could argue that Morendil *submitted* a
Proposal, it's just that the Proposal he submitted was never *received*.
But equally, given the distinction made in R1483 between collections of
text and Proposals, one could argue that Morendil merely submitted a
*collection of text*, which does not become a Proposal until it reaches
the PF. On that basis, the requirement in R1865 to "submit a Proposal"
becomes a requirement to submit a collection of text which is actually
received in the PF.

That may be the best thing. I'm undecided between continuing the old
policy of random selections, and using the new powers your amendments
have given me.

I can say that if I decide to use the new powers, then I will be
selecting Judges whom I think will deliver the best Judgements, not
necessarily the Judgements I want to see delivered.

Can it be? My god, an Accountor's Report. We haven't seen one since
September. I'd almost forgotten what they looked like.

Congratulations on being elected Treasuror and Accountor, Crito.

Would Chancellor Andre like to turn the key in the ignition of the
economy by raising the BOS?

Thanks for this careful summary, Steve. There is only one point I
disagree with: I don't think that "The findmail archives contain no
record of Morendil's message" is the (factual and/or legal) equivalent
of "this message was delivered to the Public Forum". The rules don't
know the findmail archives, after all; and the mistake _might_ be on
findmail's side instead of Morendil's or Gecko's.

True enough, but the absence of the message from the findmail archives
is a significant piece of evidence in determining the factual/legal
question. So is Scott's corroborating statement that the message does
not appear in *his* archives either. Taken together, these two pieces of
evidence seem to me be pretty conclusive: Morendil's message did not
reach the PF.

Brain error. Core dumped.

Assessor Blob (Blob is still the Assessor, right?) should regard that

I also have no record of Morendil's message in my archives.  The
probability of failure of both my archives and of findmail's (and also
of Blob's) is remote.

This is a factual issue, not a legal one, and we have damn little
evidentiary law in Agora.

What do you make of my argument that to "submit a Proposal", an
appropriate collection of text must not only be sent by a Player, but
also received in the PF?

But then how will you provide a standard for Players to match a TO to a PO in
their messages (when they want to pay one off before you have reported the
internally generated PO identifier?

I don't really care that much about this, actually; my system
generates internal numbers for all POs.  I can track POs that don't
have numbers provided by their issuers, which are, after all, strictly
a convenience.  If the issuer of a PO doesn't give it an identifying
number, I don't create one for it.

I have a form that let me enter a new PO or TO in under a minute; the
form system interfaces with my mail archiver so I don't have to
translate the dates by hand, which is probably the most tedious part.

I guess it is fairly clear now that no subscriber, nor the list manager,
actually received that message from the listserv?

However, that still leaves the two possibilities that the message was
received by gecko, which then swallowed it, or that it never actually
reached gecko.

Greetings,
rjan.

Rule 1483 requires that for a collection of text to become a Proposal, 
it must be delivered to the Public Forum.  I think for an act of
delivery to be considered accomplished, the article delivered must be
received by the intended recipient; otherwise, the article is not
delivered.  Hence, I agree with you that receipt by the Public Forum
is required before a collection of text becomes a Proposal.  Evidence
of an attempt is, by itself, insufficient.

IMO, it's up to each Player who issues POs to adopt a mechanism for
denominating eir POs in a useful, unambigious manner.  The usefulness
of concocting a scheme of my own is limited because other Players
don't know in what order I might assign such systematic identifiers
(because of the mail reordering problem).  If the Officer executing
the PO neglects to provide an identifier, there is little utility in
adding one of my own beyond the sequence number necessary to keep SQL
happy.

I would note that Rule 1483 requires not that a Player "send" a
message to the Public Forum, but that e "deliver" the message.  To
this writer, to "send" a message merely entails throwing it out into
the wilds with the intent that it be received.  In contrast, to
"deliver" a message necessitates having the message actually reach its
intended recipient.

It seems clear to me that the weight of the evidence is that Morendil
failed to deliver (although not to send) to the Public Forum the
collection of text he intended to become a Proposal.  He therefore
failed to submit a Proposal prior to the time by which he was required
to do so to avoid liability.

Steve, your argument reminds me of Justice Marshall.  :)

I don't think it is useful, or even meaningful, to distinguish between
the two cases; both would seem to me to be instances of nondelivery.

I'll assume that was a compliment. On the other hand, wasn't it Marshall
who delivered the infamous judgement which allowed the US to break the
treaties it had already signed with the American Indians, and push them
off the land it had already granted them?

Hello,

I am popularly known as Leadryl Dracos.

Eventually, I will join this Nomic, but I will lurk for a little while more
as:

a) I haven't read all the rules and
b) I haven't yet ascertained all the consequences from joining and not doing
anything.
c) I want to see the economy run for a bit before I have to make decisions
about my actions.

Just thought I'd introduce myself now before I started making comments.

I may have to decide on just that...

I definitely agree that it would be in our best interests if we didn't
need to look at automatic, possibly unlogged processes to find out whether
something has reached a PF.  On the other hand the Rules are clear that
whether a message reaches the PF is not dependent on any single Player
receiving it.

Greetings,

Are the Rules so clear? We have your Judgement in CFJ 866, in which you
ruled "the time of receipt to be when the message enters the recipient's
normal technical domain of control, whether this be eir private machine
or eir private account on a shared machine (but not the shared machine
itself, if the recipient does not control it.)"

However, you restricted yourself in that Judgement to dealing with the
case in which recipient is a person (see the case sheet for CFJ 866),
not addressing the question of what it means for a message to be
received in the PF.

Nor is R478 any help, since it only defines what it means for a message
to be *sent* to the PF, not what it means for a message to be received
in the PF.

Unless there are obvious legislative bars to do doing so, I'd be
inclined to judge that it is a minimum (ie necessary but not sufficient)
condition on a message's reaching the PF that it be received by at least
one Player other than the sender.

More just a comment.  After having spent four entire days discussing
_Marbury v. Madison_, I am a bit sick of the man.  Besides, it's not
like he had the purest of motives: in order to come to the conclusion
he did in _Marbury_, he had to deliberately misinterpret both the
Judiciary Act of 1789 _and_ Article III of the Constitution.

I believe so.  Of course, if he had not done so, he may very well have
been impeached.  The doctrine of judicial review was not
well-established at that point, and the Supreme Court acting to
abrogate an act of the Executive would likely have raised a
Constitutional crisis.

I checked the records yesterday, and that's what I saw. I have just 
checked them again, and you are perfectly right. Nevermind, all it means
is that both transfers succeeded, and the Priority of the proposal was
four, rather than two. I don't think that effects any later events.

I would in no way object to a brightline rule holding that no message
can be considered to have been delivered to a Public Forum if it has
not been received by at least one Player other than the sender.

I regard it as a white elephant, and a lot of busy-work for the 
Promotor which rarely produces anything interesting.

"PF" is shorthand for "Public Forum". For Kolja's vote to be valid,
it must be sent to the Public Forum (by Rule 1764). Agora-discussion is
_not_ a Public Forum (check the Registrar's Report, and R478). Kolja
should have sent his message to agora-business. (Agora-official, or 
either of the backup lists would also have worked, but generally this
kind of traffic is meant to go on a-b).

Actually most of these are no longer in use, because the concepts they
refer to are no longer in the Rules. What things do we need to add to 
this?

VT   = Voting Token
VTCL = Voting Token Circulation Level
BOS  = Base Officer Salary
a-d  = agora-discussion (replaced the old nomic-discussion mailing list).
a-b  = agora-business
a-o  = agora-official (these three may still be referred to as n-d, n-b, n-o)

R1234 = Rule 1234
P3456 = Proposal 3456
