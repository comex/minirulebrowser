Rather than R1647 overriding *its own* claim that Speaker-Elect is an
Office, I consider it far more natural that R1647 should override R1006's
claim that Offices are always held by exactly one Player.  This would make
Speaker-Elect an unheld Office.  (This might be just as bad as having the
identity of the Speaker-Elect be indeterminate; I shall leave it to others
to analyze that situation.)

Then again, wasn't there some situation recently in which something took
precedence over R1647?  None of the Power > 1 Rules seem applicable, so
it'd have to claim precedence over R1647 and also have a lower Rule number
(to override R1647's precedence claim).

Really?  All Maintenance Fees are in terms of Ergs, and the text is intended
to allow one Payment Order to cover all Structures - so it should be just one
additional Payment Order per week.  (I have taken to checking the Currency
Reports each week to see whether I owe anything.)
