Why? Voting is not a form of taxation.

The reason I wanted the BOS lowered is that more VTs were being paid
out than spent. But achieving that balance is only part of what I
want. With that done, what I'd really like to do is increase the
absolute *size* of the economy, ie the number of VTs actually being
spent. Then we could happily raise the BOS again. Most of my recent
activities have had the aim of increasing VT expenditure - including
lobbying non-voters to vote.

That's certainly a good reason to be saving your VTs, and I wish you
luck, because I think you're going to need it. VTs are not yet so
scarce (and therefore so valuable) that one of them will buy an
Indulgence, which are much scarcer. My intuitive estimate of the
price of Indulgences in VTs in the current environment would be an
absolute floor price of 3 VTs, possibly going as high as 5 VTs.

I shall review my VT position and consider making you an offer.

Only to the extent that one is prepared to see the game stagnate
completely as Proposals fail Quorum one after the other. This is
precisely the dilemma for Players I want to spend the next 2 months
exploring.

I'd vote for the first part, and not because I'm the Assessor!
I'm not sure I'd vote for the second part, though. It's just
another easy out for Players who don't want to vote, whereas
everything I'm trying to do at the moment is aimed at increasing
the pressure on Players to vote. If it turns out that nothing
will persuade enough Players to pay to vote so that Proposals reach
Quorum, then we might as well just let the suspension of R1715
quietly expire on August 12. I don't think lowering Quorum is the
way to go.

Because a tax tends to penalize hoarders more than non-hoarders,
while a reduction in salary makes no distinctions.

I think the issues are more complicated than that. In terms of
the absolute quantities if VTs levied, a tax hits the richer harder
than the poorer, but in relative terms, since it's a flat tax, the
tax also makes no distinctions between hoarders and non-hoarders.

But that has nothing to do with why I lobbied to have the BOS
lowered, rather than lobbying to have the VTCL lowered. The reason
for that is that I want to see whether the threat of stagnation
alone might be sufficient to induce Players not to hoard. If that
doesn't work, and expenditure contracts again so that scarcity is
again threatened, I might well change tack and start lobbying the
Accountor to lower the VTCL to, say, 5, and see whether that might
be effective in encouraging Players to spend VTs.

But in relative terms, a reduction in the BOS hurts non-hoarders
more than hoarders, at least in the short term.  Regardless of
whether you look at absolute or relative values, a reduction
in salary is better for hoarders, relative to non-hoarders,
than a tax is.

(Yes, I know that wasn't your main point.  It's not that I'm
ignoring it, I just don't have anything to add to it.)

Dear nomics connected to Agora in friendship,

I am required by the rules of Agora, and it is a pleasure for me, to
announce to you that June 30th will be Agora's fifth birthday. Rather
than tell in my own newbie words how Agora was born, and why we
celebrate its birthday, I present to you the lovely rule that
commemorates Agora's birthday in our ruleset:

Rule 1727/3 (Power=1)
Happy Birthday

      WHEREAS, in June 1993, the world's only MUD-based nomic, Nomic
      World, had recently collapsed; yet, many of its players enjoyed
      nomic and did not wish to forego such a noble pursuit;

      And WHEREAS, Originator Chuck Carroll therefore composed an
      Initial Ruleset for an email nomic, based on the Initial
      Rulesets of Peter Suber, inventor of Nomic, and on the Rulesets
      of Nomic World and other nomics,

      And WHEREAS, a nomic thus rose like a phoenix from the ashes of
      Nomic World, played on the mailing list originally set up for
      discussion of Nomic World, and coming into existence at June 30,
      1993, 00:04:30 GMT +1200, with a message sent by First Speaker
      Michael Norrish, which read, in part,

      each;

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Chancellor shall, on behalf of
      the Bank, submit Transfer Orders for one P-note each from the
      Bank to each Player who posts to the Public Forum during Agora's
      Birthday a message recognizing Agora's Birthday; these Transfer
      Orders to be executed as soon as possible after Agora's Birthday
      ends;

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Notary may select up to three
      Contests, in existence on Agora's Birthday, which have as their
      purpose encouraging the celebration of Agora's Birthday; and

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Courts shall be closed on
      Agora's Birthday; that is, the Clerk of the Courts shall not

      Decisions of Appeals Boards, or Opinions, on Agora's Birthday;
      nor shall any Player submit to the Clerk of the Courts a Call

No?  It seems to me that Agorans are saying "We appreciate
your contribution to the game, but not enough to make
it economically worthwhile."
<<

Well, I'd say that P3760 wasn't an attempt to say anything to
officers. It was an attempt to avoid two unpleasant alternatives, both
based on the observation that now, with a flexible BOS and several
incentives to spend VTs we are getting close to making the economy
work (by abolishing inflation), but that additional currency produced
by plots would completely upset this fine balance and thwart our
recent efforts. The two obvious reactions to this are: Delay the
introduction of plots (while we have passed the initial proposal, we
can still follow this path by delaying the bug fixes, but that's a bit
unstylish if you ask me). Or give up our attempts to make the economy
work, go back to role-playing red tape mode and spens lots of time
pushing around currency everyone has, without any serious effect.

P3760 was an attempt at a compromise: allow active players
(i.e. officers) to continue playing as if plots had never happened;
but at the same time it is possible to work on plots, if one or two
players are willing to be non-officers and try out the plot stuff
(with both the potential gain, and the risks connected with untested
rule sections). This reduces the risk of flooding the economy with
additional money (if all officers play around with plots). 

The question whether officers are getting fair salaries compared to
what can be made by plotholders should be adressed when we know how
much money plot owners can make (far, far in the future...), and it
can easily be made by adjusting the BOS and the yield of various
structures.

      Quorum for a Proposal is achieved if a vote is cast on that
      Proposal by one-third of Active Players who have not been 
      denied Voting Privileges, or one-fifth of all Players, 
      whichever is greater.

      Quorum for a Proposal is calculated using the number of
      Registered Players, their Hold statuses (On or Off), and their
      Voting Privileges at the beginning of the prescribed Voting
      Period for that Proposal.

I think that's a good idea. Why should the Agora community as a whole
be pubished (with more difficult quorum) for the neglect of individual
players who don't pay their bills?

I think that recent attempts to reduce the influx of VTs to match the
current rate of VT expenditures has actually caused a reduction in VT
expenditure.  One might also consider that the recent reluctance to vote is
actually a sign that a VT is now, due to scarcity, worth more than a vote on
most proposals.

That is true, however I think many Players will take quite a risk to be in a

Currently, I have no source of VT's.  There is next to nothing you could do
to increase my VT expenditure.  Each VT I spend merely places me in a more
precarious financial position and makes it even less likely that I will
spend more.  Currently, it would take an extraordinary proposal that was in
danger of failing (or passing as the case may be) to get me to expend VT's.
My VT's are simply worth more to me than a vote.

I encourage you all to join me in the game of Pass the Parcel. It's fun.
It's free. It's Agora's Birthday, and it offers you a no-risk opportunity
to win up to 5 VTs! What more could you ask?

Overall, a very worthwhile idea, I think.  A few specific
comments:

Keep in mind that there's currently a proposal up to get rid of delayed

Too broad, I think.  You'll need a Recordkeepor for Patent Titles,
Groups, Rules, SLCs, etc.  I would just keep 1578 pretty much the
way it is, and explicitly define Recordkeepors for Plots, Structures,
and Kudos.

That's not so clear: 18 VTs were spent on Proposals 3761-3763.

It's not quite true that you have *no* source of VT income - you are
on unemployment benefits (currently 0.2 VTs/week). Not much I know,
but still...

Nevertheless, recognizing your impecunious state, I'll pay you 1.5
VTs to vote FOR P3761.

My vote is not for sale.  If you convince me that the proposal is worth one
of my VTs I will vote for it.  Hmmm...  I suppose that now that I can't
declare presence, I might allow you to pay the cost of my Vote as an
alternative way of showing a small degree of support.

An average of slightly more than 1 VT per Player on 3 Proposals.  I stand
corrected.  There is obviously an abundance of enthusiasm for Voting in the

P3761 changes the reward for getting a Proposal passed from 2 VTs
to 2 P-Notes. This is a good idea for two reasons: firstly, the VT
rewards are high and were concentrating wealth in the hands of
Proposers. Secondly, and more importantly, we need a reliable mechanism
of P-Note supply.

I'll happily pay the cost of your vote FOR P3761.

Despite the fact that I don't want to overly limit means of gain VTs, I do
agree that in the current climate 2 VTs does seem high for this.  Also, I
like the idea of changing the reward to P-Notes.  This somewhat offsets the
cost getting a Proposal out of the Queue. As such, it seems a not
unreasonable reward.  I accept your offer.

I just had an idea that might encourage Votes.  How about adding a lottery
aspect to Voting?  One voter at random would receive a small portion of all
VTs spent on a Proposal.  Or perhaps, a percentage of the proceeds could be
divided among those Voters on the 'winning side'?  If the prize could be
kept smaller than the total spent by gamblers, it would have a net positive
effect on VT expenditure.

Good. When I was writing this proto, I was surprised that the Rule was
still there -- I was sure we would have repealed it a long time before now.

A secondary idea that came to me as I was working on it, though, was that
many things we currently require people to track are basically Nomic
Entities that *would* fall under this Rule as written. Then, we can just
say for each of these Entities, "Officer XXXX is the Recordkeepor for
Entity YYY," and add a requirement of all Recordkeepors to report the
required information on their Entities every n weeks, and voila! 

I do think I should change the Rule to only requiring a Recordkeepor for
Entities which the Rules specifically say should have a Recordkeepor, just
to keep things well-defined and keep away the split game states. :)

As I've been thinking about this, I've been thinking about Chuck's (I
think) massive proto that solidified the slightly shady Rules involving
Nomic Entities and Nomic Properties in the Ruleset currently. It must have
been almost a year ago. Do you still have a copy of that lying around
anywhere, Chuck (or anyone)?


Oh, and BTW: I haven't forgotten about the "Plot Reform" proto I promised
to take off of Blob's hands. I just felt that it would be better to pass
this first and get the framework set up rather than write a brand new
transfer framework for the Plots proposal and then replace it almost
immediately...

I'm not questioning that we might define Recordkeepors for these
things.  I just don't know that it would be particularly useful
for things like this that aren't transferred around.

That's more or less what I was envisioning.  (Or even more so, isn't
it kind of redundant anyway to say "Plots must have a Recordkeepor
at all times" and "The Recordkeepor for Plots is the Cartogrphor?")

Well, I gave an idea of the general framework, but didn't really
flesh out many of the details.  If I had, it certainly would
have been massive!  I'll look and see if I still have it
around somewhere.

Trickier than I'd hoped. The Regulations of the Pass the Parcel Contest
do not state how they may be amended - a serious oversight - and
neither do the Rules. 

The Regulations of a Contest are an SLC, and R1589 states that:

      A SLC shall not be changed except in accordance with the Rules.
      Notwithstanding any other method which may be defined, a SLC may
      always be changed by the operation of an instrument of Power 1
      or greater.

      A SLC is permitted to define its own mechanisms for changing its
      own content, and any change to a SLC adopted in accordance with
      its own mechanisms is legal.

We don't have time to pass an Power=2 Urgent Proposal to amend the Regs,
so it seems to me at least that the Regulations of the Pass the Parcel
Contest cannot be legally amended.

No - wait! At the last minute, I find this:

Rule 1612/1 (Power=1)
Organizations' SLCs

      Unless otherwise specified in an Organization's SLC, that SLC
      can be changed by the unanimous consent of all the Players
      within the SLCs Jurisdiction.

      The Jurisdiction of an Organization's SLC is permitted to vary
      over the period of its existence. The SLC of an Organization
      ceases to exist when the Organization ceases to exist.

So you can amend the SLC with the unanimous consent of yourself
and the Contestants, which I think are Harlequin and myself.
Post an amendment an I'll consent to it.

18 VTs is a good turn out in a Week where only 10.6 VTs were paid out in
Salaries.
