The trend recently has been towards giving Officers more autonomy;
however, there have been few suggestions as to how to give
such power to the Rulekeepor.  Here is one way:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

ProtoProposal Chuck121.1
Power to the Rulekeepor

Rule 947 is amended to read:

      If a Proposal is adopted which, as part of all of its effect,
      repeals one or more Rules, and immediately prior to the
      adoption of this Proposal there were more than 100 Rules, the
      Rulekeepor may pay out 1 P-Note to the Proposer of that
      Proposal.  

      For each Batch of Proposals, the Rulekeepor may select one
      Proposal in that Batch which was adopted and effected at least
      one Rule Change, and pay out to its Proposer a number of VTs
      not to exceed 0.3 VTs.  The Rulekeepor may not pay emself VTs
      in this way.  

The Title of Rule 947 is changed to "Rewards for Rule-Changing
Proposals".

[Comment: in the first paragraph I simply changed "shall" to "may".
This allows the Rulekeepor, for example, not to pay rewards for
Proposals which Repeal a Rule but do not repeal anything "in spirit",
such as P3816.  The second paragraph was inspired in part by the old
Wizard rules, although only one proposal per batch may be rewarded.]
