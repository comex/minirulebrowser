1 VT or less, actually.  How many Proposals in recent history have
had only 1 VT - or no VTs - spent on them?

Yes.  There is no Welcom Wagon.  There may be a Welcome Wagon, though.

[Seriously, there is supposed to be a Welcome Wagon, but in practice
 we have often lacked one.]

Part of an old scam to get around the anti-bribery rules:  Players were
said to receive "happy walruses" or "sad walruses", which later turned
into positive and negative Extra Votes, or something.  The delay period
was so short that everyone got into a ridiculous quantum-physics argument
over whether the claimed effect was possible, until the scammers gave up.

I wasn't around at the time of this scam, but from the sounds of it, the
scammers were right to be disgusted.

If it helps, here is the last Scorekeepor Report that I have on

Urg.  Ugh.  That leaves us with a situation which is confusing,
at best, since each of those Rules will now have two copies
of that paragraph.

We have no general principle for deciding conflicts within
a single Rule.  This, I feel, is as it should be--they should
be decided on a case by case basis.  In general, a Rule
is a short enough document that cases where a Rule conflicts
with itself are rare, especially when one takes into account
the natural usage of language.

For example, suppose a Rule says, "If Chuck's score becomes prime,
the Scorekeepor shall pay him 1 VT.  However, if everyone else's
score is prime when Chuck's score becomes prime, the Scorekeepor
shall pay him 10 P-Notes instead, and not pay him any VTs."

If we were to take an ultraliteral interpretation of this
Rule, it conflicts with itself when everyone else's score
is prime and my score becomes prime: the first sentence
says I get 1 VT, and the second says I do not.  However,
few, if any, people would insist on this ultraliteral interpretation,
and I think it could be agreed that the second sentence, by
virtue of natural usage, "takes precedence" over the first.
(One might appeal to the unwritten principle that a more
specific case takes precedence over a more general case.
I'm not sure that this always applies, but I can't think
of any counterexamples.)

I would argue that a Rule containing a single "viral paragraph,"
such as the current Rules 452, 1625, and 1764, are such examples
as well.  An ultraliteral interpretation would be that
they conflict with themselves; however, a natural reading
is that the viral paragraph supersedes the rest of the Rule.

However, if Steve's Proposal were to pass, we would have
two viral paragraphs in each of those Rules, and I
don't see any "natural" preference for one or the other
having precedence.

The matter would have to be decided by the courts.  While
there's nothing wrong with our courts (at least not that's
relevant to this case :) I'd prefer not to enact such
a Rule in the first place, especially when non-confusing
alternatives would work just as well.

Also note that if the courts determined that the second
viral paragraph took precedence over the first, the first
would remain in the Rule indefinitely, and make secret
voting the standard indefinitely, rather than merely
extending the trial for an additional two months.

Ouch. How silly of me. A moment's thought should have revealed to me the
pernicious way in which the two copies of the paragraph would interact
with each other. What I should have done, and may well still propose to
do, was to delete one paragraph and replace it with a new one.

When I proposed this, I had hoped it would pass because people
would be too VT-stingy to vote against it.  Since VT scarcity
has been instituted, there's been a lot less AGAINST voting
going on.  While it may have become a bit harder to pass
non-controversial proposal, I think it might now be easier
to pass controversial proposals.  I had hoped that
people would either be too frugal to vote against it
(particularly since there's no guarantee that it would
fail, in which case the VTs against would just be wasted),
or else that they would consider the overall proposal worthwhile
even with the "rider" attached.  (A common practice in
actualy legislative bodies, I understand.  One of the
most odious recent examples being the inclusion of the
Murkowski amendment in the otherwise good and popular
anti-slamming bill in the U.S. Senate, S.1618.)

It didn't really occur to me that it might pass simply
because the rider wasn't noticed by most people--or if
it did, I considered it exceedingly unlikely--until
Steve's Wizard's report on the proposals came out,
shortly after they were distributed.  When he didn't comment
on the rider in assigning style, I concluded that he
probably hadn't noticed it, so there was a good chance
that others would miss it too.

I guess this isn't a scam in the traditional sense.  Certainly,
I haven't taken advantage of any rule loophole.  Yet somehow
it seems to me to have the feel of one--I propose to call this
the (a?) Purloined Letter Scam, after the Poe short story.  (Had
I been thinking about it, I would have titled R1861 "The
Purloined Letter.")

An alternate solution might be to delay its distribution until
a time such that, when/if it is adopted, the first viral
paragraphs have already been repealed.  Of course, in that
case there would be a short period of public voting.

Turns out it affects Proposal results, too, if Steve's right--and
not just a matter of Steve having to report them again.  I
didn't receive any votes on the Proposals I reported as Assessor,
but if I wasn't Assessor, Steve's attempt to buy back Quorum
on P3766 failed (the Assessor can't buy back Quorum), so
P3766 fails quorum 4-0, instead of passing 4-0 as I reported.

For votes which were sent to me on those Proposals which are
still up for vote, you may wish to re-send them to Steve
to be safe.

Of course, it could have been worse, if I had received lots
of votes.  This points out a problem with mandatory private
voting (as opposed to optionally private voting).  When
effects that are usually achieved by private mail to an officer
may also be achieved by a post to the PF, then if a person is
unsure of the identity of an Officer, e can still achieve
the desired effect in the PF.  When an action *must*
be private, this sort of problem is more likely to
arise.  (Actually, I realized this problem with mandatory
private voting a few days ago, before I knew of this specific
case.)

I believe this to be undesirable, and so, I will oppose
any extension to our current mandatory private voting
trial.  (I have no strong feelings on optionally private
voting vs. public voting.)

I don't think the appeal to principle is required; clearly the word

I also don't see the point to mandatory private voting, since there
appears to be nothing prohibiting a Player from voting privately, and
also publically announcing eir intent or desire to vote, which is not
prohibited by the Rule.  Because it fails to proscribe public
discussion of voting with sufficient breadth, I believe the Private
Voting Rule serves no substantial purpose to justify its
reauthorization.

It did have quite an affect on Marks.  It had to do with a rule that said, if
anytime in the future an entity known as the Point Sucker exists, then . . .
So I changed my Agora Nickname to The Point Sucker.  I believe it was elJeffey
that insisted I could not just change my name like that.  

So what is the curretn process for changing Agora nicknames?

It nevertheless remains true that few Players have discussed their
votes, and indeed there are good reasons not to do so, since that
information can be used by other Players to optimize their own voting.
You will no doubt reply that we could return to the situation prior
to the imposition of Public Voting, when voting could be private or
public at the discretion of the Player. This would be a good point if
Players always behaved completely rationally, but they do not. In
particular, given the option of Public Voting, Players tend to exercise
it, "just to be sure" that their votes reach the Assessor, and so
the information which permits vote optimization comes into the public
domain. So Private Voting does serve the substantial purpose of
increasing VT expenditure, since in practice it does have the effect
of reducing the ability of Players to optimize their voting strategies,
just as it was intended to do.

You should have assessed demand first: I would have offered you twice
that, and don't you think a bidding war would have been fun? 

Have you got any more Indulgences to sell?

Michael.

I could probably have gotten more from Steve, but it seemed a fair price.

I would be willing to sell 1 more.  Let's see... that would be 4 VTs
correct?
