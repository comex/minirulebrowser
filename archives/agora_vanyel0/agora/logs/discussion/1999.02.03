Protoproposal Chaos109 [rev. 1]

Reformat Rule 1665

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1665 be amended to read:

      (a) The Rules can give certain Officers latitude to make certain
          decisions and determinations based upon their judgement. 
          When these decisions and determinations have effect on the
          Game State, Players shall always have the ability to make
          Claims of Error alleging that these decisions and
          determinations were made outside the authority given to the
          Officer.  This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which
          otherwise defines a final arbiter for such decisions and
          determinations.

      (b) If such a Claim is denied by the Officer, the Player making
          the Claim is then permitted to make a Call for Judgement
          alleging that the Officer is guilty of Abuse of
          Responsibility, a Class C Crime.  This is the only time such
          a CFJ is permitted.

      (c) In Judging such a CFJ, to find the Officer guilty the Judge
          must establish that the Officer:
        (1) went beyond all reasonable interpretations of the Rules;
        (2) disregarded explicit instructions the Rules gave in regard
            to eir decisions and determinations; or
        (3) showed a pathological lack of judgement in such decisions
            and determinations.

      (d) The accused Officer must be given the opportunity to explain
          eir actions, and such Judgements shall be made in accord to
          the strictest possible standard of proof.

Changes to this version: I added a small premium for those who
form a Team, as incentive to do so. The rest is mostly cosmetic.
I intend to officially Propose this in a couple of days if I
don't receive any more feedback, so let me know if this can
be improved. The big question: is there any objection to letting
the Scorekeepor compete along with everybody else?

Vlad


The following is not a Proposal. My comments are in brackets.

Protoproposal Vlad-GAT v.5:
The Grand Agoran Tournament
This Proposal consists of a number of Proposed Rule Changes, each
marked by *

* 	Create a Rule entitled "The Grand Agoran Tournament" with the
following text:

	The Grand Agoran Tournament consists of a series of Rounds.
These Rounds begin on the First of March, June, September, and October
of each year, and last for three months. The first Round begins March
1, 1999. At the beginning of each Round, the Scorekeepor will draw up
a list of all Active Players in descending order of their Scores from
the preceding Round. For the first Round, this will be done instead in
descending order of the Players' combined P-Note and VT holdings taken
from the most recent Official Reports. Ties will be broken by random
selection. 

	The Scorekeepor will then define a number of Circles among
which the Active Players will be partitioned. These must be as few as
possible, but there is a minimum of three Circles and an initial
maximum of six Players per Circle. They are designated the First
Circle, Second Circle, etc. ... Nth Circle. The First Circle is the
highest ranking Circle, and the Nth Circle is the lowest ranking
Circle.
	 The initial number of spots in each Circle will be the number
of Active Players divided by the number of Circles (FRD). If there are
more Active Players than spots the Scorekeepor will add one spot to
the Nth Circle, then one to the N-1th Circle, etc. until there are
exactly as many spots as Active Players. The First Circle spots are
filled with the highest ranked Players from the preceding Round
(skipping Inactive Players), and so on down the remainder of the
Circles in order. After the above procedure, if a Player is assigned a
Circle below that of another Player with whom e was tied at the end
the last Round, that Player shall be moved into the same Circle as the
Player with whom e was tied (this last procedure is ignored for the
first Round). The initial Score for each Player in each Round is zero.
	When a Player joins the game e is automatically assigned to
the same Circle e held when e deregistered (if applicable and
possible), or else the lowest Circle. A Player going On Hold is
automatically withdrawn from the current Round of competition. A
Player coming Off Hold is treated as a new Player for the purposes of
this Rule, with an initial Score of zero.

[The Circle system I consider the heart of this Proposal. The
Circle system allows Players to compete against others with a similar
amount of time to devote to the game or of a similar skill level. This
should hopefully increase competitiveness among all Players, not just
those at the top.]

* Add a new Rule entitled "Competitions" with the following text

The Individual Competition
	At the end of each Round each Player with the highest Score in
eir Circle wins that Round for that Circle and receives the
corresponding Scoring Patent Title. Any Player winning eir Circle has
the option of not participating in the Round immediately following. To
exercise this option, the Player must post eir wishes to the Public
Forum within two weeks after the beginning of the Round e is opting
out of. The Player then receives no Score, and is ineligible for SPTs.
The next Round the Scorekeepor shall seed the Player based on the
score that Player received two Rounds previously.

The Team Competition
	The Team Competition runs parallel to and concurrently with
the Individual Competition. A Team consists of a group of Players who
have signed an Application to Form a Team within two weeks of the
beginning of the Round in which they wish to compete. If fewer then
two Teams register for a round, there is no Team Competition that
Round. A Team's Score is the combined Scores of its members. A Team
wins the Team Competition if at the end of that Round its Score is
greater than that of the other registered Teams. If a Team is formed
and persists to the end of the Round without being dissolved, the
Scorekeepor shall instruct the Accountor to pay out 2 VTs to each
member of that Team.

*	Create a Rule entitled "Applications to Form a Team" with the
following text:

There is a type of Application called an Application to Form a Team
(AFT). A valid AFT, in order to have effect upon Execution, must
contain the following:

i)	The name of the proposed Team.
ii)	The Players who will compose the Team, which must include the
Sponsor.
iii)	The Signatures of the Players who will compose the Team.

The Sponsor of an AFT will be known as the Team Captain for the
duration of the Round.

To be valid, an AFT must also fulfill the following conditions:
i)	The proposed Team must consist of at least three Players
ii)	No two proposed Team members may belong to the same Circle.
iii)	No proposed Team Member may belong to an already existing
Team.
If any of the above three conditions ceases to be true, a Team is
immediately dissolved and removed from the current Team Competition.

A valid AFT is Executed by sending it to the Scorekeepor or submitting
it to the Public Forum.

The effect of Execution of an AFT is the entrance of the proposed Team
into the current Team Competition. A Team is automatically dissolved
at the end of the current Round, but may register again in subsequent
Rounds.

An AFT shall only be valid if its contents are not in conflict with
this or other Rules.  An AFT that is not valid shall never be
Executed.

[The Team Competition adds an interesting new dimension, combining
cooperation with competition. The requirement to have the Players come
from different Circles makes all Players desirable to have on one's
team.]

* 	Create a Rule entitled "The Scorekeepor" with the following
Text:

	There is an Office of Scorekeepor, whose Salary is 1.5 times
the Basic Officer Salary, and whose responsibility it is to keep
accurate track of the current Score of all Players. The Scorekeepor's
Report consists of the Circles of the current Round and the Players in
each Circle, the current Scores of each Player, the changes in Scores
since the last Report and the way those points were earned, the Teams
entered in the current Team Competition, and the current Team Scores
of each Team. The Scorekeepor is only obliged to keep track of scores
and post reports if a Round is currently underway.
	The Scorekeepor is also responsible for posting the final
Scores at the end of each Round, and announcing the SPTs awarded to
the Players that have fulfilled the conditions for receiving them.

Once per Round, no more than two weeks and no less than one week
before the end of the Round, the Scorekeepor may act to change
the Scoring Rule Without 3 Objections. The Scorekeepor may only
propose changes to the basis of Scoring, otherwise the Action
automatically fails. If the action takes effect, the Scoring Rule
is changed appropriately at the beginning of the next Round.

[Basic stuff. Of course, the Scoring Rule can be changed in
conventional ways, but I felt it was good to have a way of easily
making changes between Rounds. Question: Should the Scorekeepor be a
competitor in the GAT?).]

*	Create a Rule entitled "Scoring" with the following text:

 	Players receive Points when certain actions are performed by
them or when certain events occur. This is the only Rule which
may define the methods of Scoring. In general, a Player may receive
points only for actions which occur during the current Round, although
those actions may depend on others which occurred previously (thus,
for example, a Player could gain points for one of eir Proposals
passing, even if the Proposal was distributed before the beginning of
the current Round.). Points are non-transferable.

	In general, a Player may receive points for a certain type of
event any number of times, unless that event has a number (N) after
it, in which case a given Player may be awarded points for that type
of event only N times in a given Round.

	If not otherwise noted, Points awarded for events referring to
"a Player" or "any Player", go to that Player. Bonuses are in addition
to the basic award. Multipliers are in lieu of the basic award.
Bonuses can be multiplied.

Responsibility for detecting changes to a Player's Score from the
following events is the responsibility of the Scorekeepor:

If a Proposal proposed by a Player passes: 5 points for first passing
Proposal by that Player in that Round, 3 for second, 1 for third, 0.5
for fourth and subsequent Proposals, +0.5 if Proposal is a Repeal, +1
if the Proposer does not Vote on the Proposal. Double points if
Proposal passes unanimously. Triple Points if the Player making the
Proposal is the only Entity who votes AGAINST.

To any Player winning a contested Election: 8 points. Double points if
Elected unanimously.

To any Player holding the most of a given currency at the end of a
Round: 8 Points per currency. Tripled if at any point during the Round
a Player had no holdings in that Currency.

To any Player tied for the most of a given currency at the end of a
Round: 5 Points per currency. Tripled if at any point during the Round
a Player had no holdings in that Currency.

To any Player holding no Currency whatsoever at the end of a Round: 5
Points.

To any Player earning no Blots during a Round: 4 Points.

To any Player having no Blots at the end of a Round: 6 Points.

To any Player voting on a Proposal: If the Player casts at least
one vote which is the same as 80% or more of the Votes cast on a
Proposal (including eir own): 1 Point, scored when the Proposal
results are announced..

To any Player voting on a Proposal: If the final tally of Votes
shows the same number of FOR votes as AGAINST votes: 2 Points,
scored when the Proposal results are announced.

To the Player Voting or declaring Presence on all Proposals of a
single distribution: 0.5 Points.


Changes to a Player's score from the following events may be reported
by any Player by notifying the Scorekeepor or posting to the Public
Forum. No Player, however, not even the Scorekeepor, is legally
required to do so.

If a Rule is created containing a Player's name in the text: 15
Points.

If a Player gains a Patent Title (other than SPTs or Degrees): 4
Points (1).

To any Player receiving a Degree: 4 Points for am A.N., 6 points for a
B.N., 8 Points for a M.N., and 12 Points for a D.N.Phil or a D.N.Hist.

If a Proposal made by a Player successfully creates a Rule with a
number that is a multiple of 23: 4 Points.

If a Player submits a Proposal to the Queue that is subsequently
discarded: 5 Points (1).

To any Player Proposing an Insane Proposal for which no Entity votes
FOR: 30 Points.

To any Player who is chided for posting a single document that is not
an Official Report to a forum other than the Public Forum by more than
one Player (other than themselves): 2 Points (1).

To the third Player other than the Poster making substantive comments
to a protoproposal: 1 Point (3).

To the Player making a COE that is Responded to and admitted by the
relevant Officer (other than themselves): 1 Point (1).

To the Player Holding an Office for at least one month during the
Round, and issuing at least one Official Report: 2 Points (1)

To the Player making a Sane Proposal for which a Non-Player Voting
Entity successfully Votes: 15 points (1).

To the Player making a Senate Proposal for which a non-Senator
successfully Votes: 25 points (1).

To any Player submitting a Judgment for a CFJ which is not Appealed
before the end of the Round: 1 point.

To the Player making a CFJ which is not Judged for one month from its
original assignment: 8 Points (1 per Player per CFJ).

When an Appeal successfully overturns a Judgment, to the Players
calling for that Appeal: 2 Points

When an Appeal fails to overturn a Judgment, to the Judge who made the
original Judgment on that CFJ: 4 Points.

If three consecutive CFJs are Judged TRUE, FALSE and UNDECIDED (in any
order), to the Player making the third CFJ: 17 Points.

When a Player is Deregistered due to Silence, to the Player last
making em Silent: 5 Points.

To the Player successfully Calling for a Revolt: 15 Points.


[Any scoring system, both in the assignment of point values to actions
and in the selection of actions themselves will be arbitrary. I sought
to have a large number of scoring actions, of various levels of
difficulty. I am open to suggestions for other scoring methods.]

*	Create a Rule entitled "Scoring Patent Titles" with the
following Text:

	Scoring Patent Titles (SPTs) are a subclass of Patent Titles.
They are identical to Patent Titles except that they are automatically
revoked at the end of the Round subsequent to the one for which they
were awarded. The valid SPTs, and the circumstances for which they are
awarded, are as follows:

For winning an Individual Competition in the Nth Circle, a Player
receives the SPT of 'Victor of the Nth Circle' (where Nth is replaced
by the ordinal corresponding to eir Circle number). If a Player wins
the same Circle two Rounds in succession e receives instead the SPT of
'Double Victor of the Nth Circle', for three consecutive Rounds
'Triple Victor of the Nth Circle', etc.

If two or more Players within a Circle are tied for the highest score
in a Circle at the end of a Round, they receive the SPT of
'Pseudo-Victor of the Nth Circle' (where Nth is replaced by the
ordinal corresponding to eir Circle number).

For being a member of a Team winning the Team Competition, a Player
receives the SPT of 'Team Victor', except for the Team Captain who
receives the SPT of "Victorious Leader"

If two or more Teams are tied for the highest Team Score at the end
of a Round, their members receive the SPT of 'Team Pseudo-Victor'

If a Player Scores enough in a Round that e would have won at least
one of the Circles higher than that in which e competed, e receives
the SPT of 'Overachiever'.

If a Player Scores so low that e would have placed last in at least
one of the Circles below eir own e receives the SPT of 'Slacker'.

[This replaces the current Champion PTs]

* Rule 755 'Champions' is hereby Repealed.

* Rule 1465 'Champion's Reward' is hereby Repealed.

* Rule 1498 'Winning by Blots' is hereby Repealed.

* Rule 1580 'Multiple Winners of a Single Game' is hereby Repealed.

* Rule 1622 'Forfeiting the Game' is hereby Repealed.

* Rule 1697 'Multiple rapid wins prohibited' is hereby Repealed.

[Clearing out the detritus of the old system. 112 is left alone for
now since repealing it now would give this Proposal an AI of 3. I
think it is best if 1638 stay as long as 112 is still on the books,
although it is irrelvant to the GAT.]

* Amend Rule 1435  'Definition of Indulgences, Blots and Immaculate'
by removing the last sentence "It is a Win-Preventing condition for a
Player to have one or more Blots."

* Amend Rule 1729 'Insanity' by replacing the last two lines with:

And should it occur (oh, need I say more?)
that no one Votes FOR it, the Proposer shall Score.

[Needed to complete the installation of the new system.]

Hm. I voted for yours, partly with the idea that this might encourage
you to return the favour.

I understood that, and I did intend to return the favour, but I was 
waiting to see if anyone else voted first. If you received three votes
without my help, I was going to save my VTs. Sorry for being so 
calculating, but the times demand it. Then again, maybe that's a good
reason to be taking care of your friends...

Protoproposal Chaos112 [rev. 1]

Reformat Rule 1664

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1664 be amended to read:

      (a) Any Player is either Abiding or Rebellious. A new Player is
          always Abiding when e becomes a player. A Player can switch
          from Abiding to Rebellious or from Rebellious to Abiding by
          sending a message to the Public Forum saying e does change
          so. The Registrar shall maintain a list of all Players that
          are Rebellious. This list is known as the Red Pages, and is
          part of the Registrar's Report.

      (b) A Player may Call for a Revolt at any time, by sending to
          the Public Forum saying e does so. A Call for Revolt is only
          effective if:
        (1) the player posting the Call is Rebellious;
        (2) no other effective Call for Revolt has been made that
            week; and
        (3) a successful Revolt has not occured for a month or more.

      (c) As soon as possible after an effective Call for Revolt has
          been posted, the Registrar must determine whether the Revolt
          succeeds, as outlined below, and post the result to the
          Public Forum.

      (d) The result of a Revolt is determined as follows: The
          Registrar selects a random integer from 1 to the number of
          Players at the time of the Call for Revolt. If this number
          is less than or equal to the number of Rebellious Players at
          the time of the Call for Revolt, then the Revolt succeeds,
          otherwise it fails.

      (e) If a Revolt succeeds, then:
        (1) A Speaker Transition occurs;
        (2) All Players that hold one or more Offices in the normal
            fashion cease to hold those in a normal fashion and hold
            them temporarily instead;
        (3) The Registrar becomes required to:
          (A) vacate all Blots of, and pay out 2 VTs to, each Player
              who was Rebellious at the time of the Rebellion; and
          (B) levy a tax of 75% on Indulgences.
        (4) All Rebellious Players become Abiding again.

      (f) If a Revolt does not succeed, then:
        (1) All Rebellious Players gain 2 Blots.
        (2) The Player who Called for Revolt gains 2 (additional)
            Blots

      (g) The Registrar is empowered to levy the tax mandated by
          subdivision (e)(3)(B) of this Rule, when it is required.

      (h) The holder of the Patent Title "Robespierre" is exempt from
          the tax mandated by subdivision (e)(3)(B) of this Rule, even
          if other rules do not allow tax exemptions.

      (i) The Registrar shall execute all Payment Orders required by
          this rule.

      (j) The Registrar is authorised to vacate any payment orders
          this rule requires em to vacate.

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 105 be amended to read:

      (a) A Rule Change is any of the following:
        (1) The enactment of a new Rule;
        (2) The repeal of an existing Rule;
        (3) The amendment of the text of an existing Rule; or
        (4) Any change to a substantive property of a Rule other than
            its text.

      (b) A "substantive property of a Rule" is any property of that
          Rule (other than its text) which determines in part or in
          full the ability of that Rule to govern by itself or in
          conjunction with other Rules.

Protoproposal Chaos42 [rev. 2]

Cleanup of R.1445

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1445 be amended to read:

      (a) When an Election is required and the procedure is not
          defined elsewhere, the following Standard Election Procedure
          shall be used. Details specified herein are defaults which
          may be modified by other Rules for specific situations.
        (1) Vote Collector: The Vote Collector is the Entity
            responsible for taking nominations, collecting and
            tallying the Votes, and announcing the result.
          (A) Unless otherwise specified, this Entity is the Player
              who is Speaker at the time the Referendum starts.
          (B) If another Player is specified, this Player shall be the
              Vote Collector for the entire duration of the
              Referendum.
          (C) If the Vote Collector deregisters or is deregistered
              before the Voting Period ends, the Election has no
              Winner.
        (2) Nominating Entities: Every Player not on Hold may Nominate
            eirself in an Election. On Hold status is measured at the
            time a Player makes a Nomination.
        (3) Nominations: A Nominating Entity makes a Nomination by
            sending a message to the Vote Collector during the
|           Nominating Period, indicating what Election e is
            Nominating for.
        (4) Candidates: A Player who has Nominated for an Election is
            called a Candidate for that Election.
        (5) Retraction: A Nomination, once sent to the Vote Collector,
            may be retracted before the end of the Nominating Period.
            A player may retract a Nomination e has made by sending a
|           message to the Vote Collector, indicating that e wishes to
            retract eir Nomination.
        (6) Start of Nominations: The Nominating Period begins at the
            time of the first correct and legal announcement that the
            Election has begun, as required by the Rules calling for
            the Election.
        (7) Duration of Nominations: The Nominating Period lasts for
            one Week.  All Nominations received by the Vote Collector
            outside of the Nominating Period have no effect.
        (8) Secrecy: Nominations need not be kept secret.

      (b) Announcing Candidates: the Vote Collector shall announce to
          the Public Forum, as soon as possible after the Nominating
          Period is over, the names of all Players who Nominated for
          the Election.

      (c) If there are no Candidates in a given Election, then that
          Election shall have no Winner. If there is only one
          Candidate in a given Election, then that Candidate shall be
          the Winner of that Election.

      (d) In all other cases, a Referendum shall being at the time
          Candidates are Announced, which shall be conducted using the
          standard procedure for Referendum Voting with the following
          exceptions:
        (1) Vote Collector: The Vote Collector for the Referendum is
            the same as the Vote Collector for the Election.
        (2) Vote Values: A Vote is the name of exactly one of the
            Candidates for the given Election. Words which are
            effectively synonymous with these are also permissible.
        (3) Adoption: The Winner of the Election is the Candidate for
            whom the most votes were cast. If there is more than one
            such candidate, the Speaker chooses one of those
            candidates as the winner, and must announce eir chosen
            candidate as winner to the Public Forum.
        (4) Quorum: Quorum shall be set at 50% of the eligible Voting
            Entities at the beginning of the Voting Period. If a
            smaller fraction voted, the Election has no Winner.

      (e) Nonperformance by Vote Collector: The Vote Collector must
          perform eir required duties, but if the result of an
          Election is not announced within one Week following the end
          of the Voting Period, the Election has no Winner.

      (f) Effective Time of Election Results: The results of an
          Election are effective at the time the results of the
          Referendum are announced; or, if there is no Referendum, at
          the time that the Vote Collector announces that there is to
          be no Referendum.

      (g) Cutoff for Challenges: Any challenge of the correctness of
          the announced results of an Election must be made within
          seven days of the time the results are announced.  If seven
          days pass from the time the results are announced without a
          challenge, the announced results are the true results of
          that Election, whether or not they be in error in any way.

Protoproposal Chaos50 [rev. 3]

Some Housecleaning

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 408 be amended to read:

      (a) The Judge of an open CFJ is required to, within seven days
          of when that CFJ last became open or seven days of eir
          assignment to that CFJ, whichever is later, close that CFJ
          by dismissing or judging the CFJ and/or granting or denying
          any outstanding judicial motions pertaining to that CFJ.

      (b) The failure of a Judge to close a case within the prescribed
          time constitutes the Infraction of Judicial Tardiness and
          carries a penalty of one Blot for each day (or fraction
          thereof) that the case remains open beyond the permitted
          time.  This penalty is to be reported by the Clerk of the
          Courts.

      (c) The failure to observe this time limit does not, by itself,
          cause the delinquent Judge to be recused from the CFJ, nor
          does it invalidate eir judgment or dismissal of the CFJ or
          grant or denial of any related judicial motion which that
          Judge might submit after the limit has expired.

      (d) This Rule defers to any other Rule which prescribes a
          different time limit in which a CFJ must be closed, and to
          any other Rule which establishes procedures by which the
          time limit specified in this Rule may be extended or
          shortened.

Cleanup of R.1006

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1006 be amended to read:

      (a) An Office is any position established by the Rules as such.

      (b) At any time, a given Office is held by exactly one Player. 
          If an Office would otherwise not be held by any Player, it
          shall be held by the Speaker.

      (c) An Officer is any Player who holds an Office.

      (d) A given Office has whatever duties, responsibilities, and
          privileges that the Rules assign to it.

[Most of the rest of the current R.1006 is superfluous baggage.]

Protoproposal Chaos70 [rev. 2]

More Sensible Amendment Numbers

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1069 be amended to read:

      (a) Each Rule shall have an Amendment Number.
        (1) The Amendment Number of a new Rule, when that Rule is
            created, is zero.
        (2) The Amendment Number of each Rule existing at the time
            this version of this Rule takes effect is whatever its
            Amendment Number was under the prior version of this Rule;
            if a Rule had no Amendment Number on that version of this
            Rule, its Amendment Number is zero.
        (3) The Amendment Number of a Rule is incremented by one
            whenever a Rule Change affecting that Rule takes place.

      (b) A Rule's Amendment Number shall be displayed in Official
          copies of the Ruleset, appended to the Rule Number, and
          separated by a forward slash.  Responsibility is given to
          the Rulekeepor to accurately update Amendment Numbers.

      (c) Amendment Numbers may be used for Official purposes and in
          Official documents to distinguish between old versions of a
          Rule and the Rule's current text.

Protoproposal Chaos120 [rev. 1]

Reformat Rule 1723

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1723 be amended to read:

      (a) A Proposal is Sane if:
        (1) the text of the message wherein it is submitted explicitly
            states that it is a Sane Proposal;
        (2) the Proposal is Interested; and
        (3) the Proposer has paid, prior to the distribution of the
            Proposal, 2 P-Notes to the Bank, expressly for this
            purpose (and not for any other).

      (b) Players may cast no more than one vote on a Sane Proposal.
          Non-Player Voting Entities may not vote on Sane Proposals.

      (c) This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would allow
          non-Player Voting Entities to vote on Sane Proposals, or
          which would allow Players to cast more than one vote on a
          Sane Proposal.

Surely one proposal could easily change both rules?

No. Rule 910 specifies that e does not receive a WEEKLY Salary. But because
the basic salary is monthly, that does not stop things any more.

I suppose this is a reasonable interpretation, and as Justiciar I shouldn't
argue too hard against it.  But I do note that while R1007 does specify that
salaries are paid out at the beginning of the month, and by implication
defines the BOS as a monthly amount, it does *not* define an Officer's
Salary.  It merely allows Rules to define Salaries in terms of the BOS
(but does not require it).

Rule 910 clearly does not define the Justiciar's salary in terms of the BOS.
The real question is, does "The Justiciar does not receive a fixed weekly
salary" succeed in defining the Justiciar's Salary as null?  This would
fall under R1007's "unless otherwise specified" clause.  I think this is
also a reasonable interpretation.  Anybody think this is worth a CFJ?

Reformat Rule 1786

      (a) A Proposal is considered to have passed by the narrowest of
          margins when:
        (1) the Proposal has met the requirements established by other
            Rules to be considered passed;
        (2) the Proposal would not have passed, would not have met
            Quorum, or both, had there been one fewer Vote cast FOR on
            it; and
        (3) at least one Vote was cast AGAINST against it.

      (b) As soon as possible after a Proposal has been determined to
          have passed by the narrowest of margins, the Assessor shall
          pay out to that Proposal's Proposer an award of 3 (three)
          Voting Tokens in addition to any other award that Player
          might also receive for the passing of that Proposal.

Protoproposal Chaos131 [rev. 1]

Reformat Rule 1726

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1726 be amended to read:

      (a) There is a type of Application known as a Guillotine
          Application.  Such an Application is Executed by submitting
          it to the Assessor.  A Guillotine Application may specify
          when it is to take effect; if it does not do so, or
          specifies a time prior to its Execution, it takes effect
          when Executed.  For a Guillotine Application to take effect,
          it must:
        (1) state that it is a Guillotine Application;
        (2) clearly identify exactly one Proposal to which it applies,
            the Voting Period of which must be in progress;
        (3) bear the signatures of a sufficient number of Active
            Senators such that the ratio of the number of Active
            Senators whose signatures it bears to the number of Active
            Senators whose signatures it does not bear exceeds the
            Adoption Index of the Proposal; and
        (4) bear the signatures of at least two Senators.

      (b) When a Guillotine Application takes effect, the Voting
          Period of the Proposal to which it applies immediately ends.
          This Rule takes precedence over all other Rules governing
          the Voting Period of Proposals.

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1724 be amended to read:

      (a) A Proposal is Urgent if:
        (1) the text of the message wherein it is submitted explicitly
            states that it is an Urgent Proposal;
        (2) the Proposal is Interested; and
        (3) the Proposer has paid, prior to the distribution of the
            Proposal, 1 P-Note to the Bank, expressly for this purpose
            (and not for any other).

      (b) The Voting Period of an Urgent Proposal is five days.

      (c) This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would specify
          the Voting Period for Urgent Proposals.

It is worth a CFJ.  We need more CFJs.

      defined elsewhere, the following Standard Referendum Voting
      Procedure shall be used. Details specified herein are defaults
      which may be modified by other Rules for specific situations.

      This procedure shall under no circumstances be used for Voting
      on Proposals, unless specifically required by the Rules
      governing specific types of Proposals.

      (a) Vote Collector: The Vote Collector is the Entity responsible
          for collecting and tallying the Votes and announcing the
          result. This Entity is the Speaker if not otherwise
          specified.

      (b) Voting Entities: Every Player not on Hold may Vote on a
          Referendum.  On Hold status is measured at the time a Player
          sends eir Vote.

      (c) Voting: A Voting Entity Votes by sending eir Vote to the
          Vote Collector during the Voting Period, indicating what
          Referendum e is Voting on, and what eir Vote is.

      (d) Vote Values: A Vote is FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN. Words which
          are effectively synonymous with these are also permissible.

      (e) Vote Strength: Every Vote has equal strength. No Voting
          Entity may Vote more than once on any single Referendum.

      (f) Retraction: A Vote, once sent to the Vote Collector, cannot
          be changed.

      (g) Start of Voting: The Voting Period begins at the time the
          first correct and legal announcement that a Referendum is
          begun, as defined in other Rules, is sent to the Public
          Forum, together with the identity of the Vote Collector.

      (h) Duration of Voting: The Voting Period lasts for one Week.
          All Votes received by the Vote Collector outside of the
          Voting Period have no effect.

      (i) Secrecy During Voting: Unless otherwise specified, the Vote
          Collector may not give away any information about the Votes
          while the Voting is underway.

      (j) This shall in no way prohibit the Vote Collector from
          posting, at any time and to the Public Forum, a list of
          those Players who have already Voted.

      (k) Secrecy After Voting: Unless otherwise specified, the Vote
          Collector shall post to the Public Forum, after the Voting
          Period is over, the number of Votes of each kind as well as
          the name and Vote of each Entity which cast a Vote.

      (l) Adoption Ratio: The Adoption Ratio, the ratio of FOR Votes
          on a Referendum relative to the AGAINST VOTES, must be
          greater than Adotion Index for the Referendum to pass. If it
          is not, the Referendum fails.

      (m) Adoption Index: Unless otherwise specified, the Adoption
          Index for a Referendum is 1.

      (n) Quorum: Quorum shall be set at 50% of the eligible Voting
          Entities at the beginning of the Voting Period. If a smaller
          fraction voted, the Referendum automatically fails.

      (o) Nonperformance by Vote Collector: The Vote Collector must
          perform eir required duties, but if the result of a
          Referendum is not announced within one Week following the
          end of the Voting Period, it automatically fails.

      (p) Effectiveness: the full effects of a Referendum, as defined
          in Rules which make use of the Referendum procedure, come
          into force as of the moment the results are announced to the
          Public Forum.

Protoproposal Chaos160 [rev. 1]

Reformat Rule 1565

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1565 be amended to read:

      (a) A Judge must dismiss a CFJ if:
        (1) it contains no clearly-identifiable Statement;
        (2) its Statement can not logically admit to either being TRUE
            or FALSE;
        (3) its Statement does not relate to a matter relevant to the
            Rules;
        (4) its Statement fails to comply with the Rules;
        (5) it lacks standing, as defined elsewhere; or
        (6) after a reasonable effort by the Judge to obtain all
            relevant information, no determination can be made of the
            truth or falsity of its Statement.

      (b) The Judge does this by notifying the CotC of the CFJ's
          dismissal, and the reasons e is doing so.  Dismissals are
          only legal when made for the reasons listed in this Rule. 
          Dismissal occurs when the CotC is notified of a legal
          dismissal.

      (c) As soon as possible after being notified of a legal
          dismissal, the CotC must post to the Public Forum a notice
          of the dismissal and the Judge's reasons for doing so.

      (d) If the dismissal, upon appeal, is subsequently set aside,
          then that CFJ is no longer dismissed. It shall be considered
          again and can not again be legally dismissed for the same
          reasons.

      (e) A Judge who dismisses a CFJ before the end of the assigned
          deliberation period shall receive a Judicial Salary of 1 VT.

Protoproposal Chaos165 [rev. 1]

Reformat Rule 1365

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1365 be amended to read:

      (a) There shall exist a type of Application called an
          Application to Submit an Opinion.  Such an Application, if
          effective, has the effect of annotating a Judgement or
          Dismissal in a given Call for Judgement. In order for such
          an Application to have effect upon Execution, it must:
        (1) clearly indicate to which CFJ it applies.;
        (2) be labeled as either a Concurring Opinion or a Dissenting
            Opinion;
        (3) indicate whether the Judgement or Dismissal to which it
            applies is that of the Judge or that of the Appeals Court;
        (4) be accompanied by reasons and arguments, which may
            include, but are not necessarily limited to, citations of
            deciding Rules, past Judgements, and Game Custom;
        (5) bear the Signatures of at least two Players; and
        (6) be Executed no earlier than the submission of the
            Judgement or Dismissal to which it applies, and no later
            than one week after the publication by the Clerk of the
            Courts of that Judgement or Dismissal.

      (b) An Application to Submit an Opinion is Executed by
          submitting it to the Clerk of the Courts.  Such an
          Application, having been Executed and having met all the
          requirements for effectiveness, is also called an Opinion. 
          It is also referred to as a Concurring Opinion or a
          Dissenting Opinion, as indicated in the Opinion.

      (c) Once an Application to Submit an Opinion is Executed and
          takes effect, the Clerk of the Courts must distribute the
          Opinion to all Players as soon as possible.  Furthermore,
          the Opinion must be appended to the Legal Judgement or
          Dismissal.

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 911 be amended to read:

      (a) When an appeal is initiated, a Board of Appeals shall be
          selected in order to reach a decision about the
          consideration mandated by the appeal.

      (b) A Board of Appeals consists of three distinct Players,
          called Justices.  The Clerk of the Courts selects the
          Justices for each Board, as follows, until three eligible
          Justices have been selected; The Speaker is selected, if
          eligible; The Justiciar is selected, if eligible; The CotC
          is selected, if eligible; Any remaining positions are then
          filled by random selection, by the CotC, from all remaining
          eligible Players.

      (c) A Player is ineligible for selection if:
        (1) e has already been selected to serve on that Board;
        (2) e has been dismissed as Justice from that Board;
        (3) e has been Judge in the matter the Board is to consider;
        (4) e was not eligible to Judge the CFJ that resulted in the
            matter under consideration when it was called, and this
            restriction does not prevent three eligible Players from
            being selected by the CotC for the Board; or
        (5) e is on Hold, and this restriction does not prevent three
            eligible Players from being selected by the CotC for the
            Board.

      (d) A Justice is permitted to appoint another eligible Player to
          replace em as Justice on a given Board, provided the Player
          consents. A Justice does this by notifying the Clerk of the
          Courts of the appointment.

Reformat Rule 1693

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1693 be amended to read:

      (a) If the Judgement of a CFJ is Appealed, the Board of Appeals
          shall consider the correctness of that Judgement. The Board
          may rule that the original Judgement was either correct or
          incorrect.

      (b) If a majority of the Justices find that the original
          Judgement was correct, then the Board's ruling is that the
          original Judgement was correct. In that case, the original
          Judge of the CFJ shall retain eir Judicial Salary and the
          original Judgement has legal effect.

      (c) If a majority of the Justices find that the original
          Judgement was incorrect, then the Board's ruling is that the
          original Judgement was incorrect. In that case, the original
          Judge of the CFJ shall forfeit eir Judicial Salary. The
          Board may then act in one of three ways, provided that a
          majority of the Justices agree:
        (1) Reversal of the Judgement. In this case, the CFJ shall be
            treated as if it were Judged normally, with the Judgement
            being that which a majority of the Justices agree on.
        (2) Dismissal of the CFJ. The CFJ shall be considered
            dismissed.
        (3) Re-assignment of the CFJ. In this case, the original
            Judgement shall be ignored, and the CotC shall reassign
            the CFJ to a new Judge in the same fashion as it was
            originally assigned; the original Judge will be considered
            Ineligible. The new Judge cannot make the same Judgement

Drat. Why is Quorum so high for Elections?

Protoproposal Chaos175 [rev. 1]

Reformat Rule 1681

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1681 be amended to read:

      (a) There is a format of the Ruleset known as the Short Logical
          Ruleset (SLR).  In this format, each Rule is assigned to a
          Rule Category, and the Rules are grouped according to their
          Category. Within a Category, the ordering of Rules is
          decided by the Rulekeepor.  All existing Rule Categories
          must be listed, even if no Rules are currently assigned to
          the Category.

      (b) The listing of each Rule in the SLR must include:
        (1) the Rule Number;
        (2) the Rule's Amendment Number;
        (3) the Rule's Power;
        (4) the Rule's Title;
        (5) the Rule's text; and
        (6) any annotations to the Rule required by Order

      (c) The Rulekeepor is strongly encouraged not to include any
          additional information in the SLR, except that which
          increases the readability of the SLR.

      (d) There is a format of the Ruleset known as the Full Logical
          Ruleset (FLR).  In this format, Rules are assigned to the
          same Category and presented in the same order as in the SLR.
          The FLR must contain all the information required to be in
          the SLR, as well as:
        (1) a brief description of each Category; and
        (2) any historical annotations which the Rulekeepor is
            required to record.

      (e) The Rulekeepor is also free to include any other information
          which e feels may be helpful in the use of the Ruleset in
          the FLR.

Isn't there some better way to do this than one Rule at a time?

Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal

      ...

      If the Voting Index is greater than the Adoption Index for the

Protoproposal Chaos191 [rev. 1]

Reformat Rule 755

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 755 be amended to read:

      There is a class of Patent Titles known as Winners' Cups. There
      are 13 different Cups, ranked in ascending order, the full list
      of which is defined in this Rule.

      Whenever a Player Wins a Game, e shall be awarded the lowest
      Cup, if e has never been awarded a Cup previously; if e already
      is the holder of a Cup, e shall be awarded the Cup immediately
      above the one e already holds, if it exists. Any other Cups
      previously held shall be immediately revoked and lose any
      Historical Significance.

      The Cups are:

      (a) (1) Paper Cup, (2) Tin Cup, (3) Glass Cup, (4) Crystal Cup

      (b) (5) Bronze Cup, (6) Silver Cup, (7) Gold Cup, (8) Platinum
          Cup

      (c) (9) Amber Cup, (10) Ruby Cup, (11) Emerald Cup, (12) Diamond
          Cup

      (d) (13) Supreme Cup

      The first three groups are known, respectively, as the Plain
      Cups, the Noble Cups and the Extravagant Cups.
