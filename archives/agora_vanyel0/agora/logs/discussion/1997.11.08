I believe that when Steve took over the main lists, it was felt that a
backup list should have a different administrator.  The Yoyo one is just
still hanging around.

I don't see any harm in it, anyhow...

It is CFJ 1053. CFJ 1051 had another text, much like it:

	"Morendil is Elde's Executor in Probate."

Has anyone reviewed the consequences of these findings?  How many
actions of Elde (by Morendil) or Blob (by Elde by Morendil) are
nullified by this determination?

Sorry, you can't Appeal his decision in CFJ 1053 as it is on an appelate
