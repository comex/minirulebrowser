I just thought I'd post this note to let you all know a bit about
myself.

Firstly, I wouldn't have joined this group if I had intended to just sit
and watch. I believe in active participation. I would rather throw
myself wholeheartedly at the game than to muddle around for months and
then quit saying "I got nothing out of it". As it stands currently (and
I have no doubt it will change as I fit in) I will probably put my two
bits worth in more often than I should. I don't do this to offend,
merely to promote discussion. My involvement will be heaviest in the
next month or so, and then will ease off as I get busy again. I will
endeavour though, never to become 'silent', and rarely to be 'quiet'.

To start with I'll probably be a bit of a 'stickler for the rules'. This
is because my understanding of the game is that the whole game is based
on the rules. I have put the rules onto a database and will keep the
database up to date from the game posts. This means that it will be
fairly easy for me to check on individual rules, and to search for
particular words. The downside of this is that if the wording is
slightly different (or even misspelt) I may miss a word in my search and
thus miss an important aspect of the rules.

In time I will find out whether Agorans are more concerned with the
letter of the rules or the intention, and many other things also. I
intend to read right through the rules by the end of my grace period (at
worst). As this goes on I will be seeking clarification of certain
aspects (eg: Frankenstein Monsters) and will probably ask the a-d forum.
Until I fully understand the rules, I will try not to do anything
without getting a fair understanding of the rules involved, but I won't
be waiting for FULL understanding as, with 288 rules, I'd probably never
do anything.

Personally, I am a Christian, male, 29, married, 14 month old son, live
in Bundaberg, Queensland, Australia. I have a Diploma in Information
technology, an Advanced Certificate in Christian Clowning, and a
long-lapsed MENSA membership. I am a very logical thinker with decent
math and language skills. I will readily (and probably too often) admit
when I am wrong. I try not to step on people's toes, but I believe in
sticking up for what's right. I have an overdeveloped sense of justice.
In a grey world, I keep trying to see black and white. I am currently
working full-time as a postal contractor and will be studying part-time
through 1998. I used to play RPGs years ago. I collect promotional
trading cards and scout badges when I have the money.

I don't believe in flaming people, so if I disagree, I will present a
logical argument in the public forum, and/or will E-Mail you privately
with my views. If I sent you a message privately and you wish to post it
to the public forum that's OK too, I have nothing to hide. A direct
message will usually be sent either to avoid cluttering the public forum
with 'personal' notes, or to avoid embarassing a person.

I hope this helps you to understand a little bit of where I'm coming
from.

Lastly, are there any 'general information' docs available about things
like the Agora World Overview, Bios on the Agorans, maybe some info
about the contests, churches, and Locations. If not I'll pick it up as I
go along (or maybe some helpful soul will E-Mail me).

Bye for Now.

Kieron (may change to a nick later).

R1644 - Class B (at least in the rules I got from the website on Fri 02 Jan).
If you claim that this Infraction is not wholly defined as Class B then you also
need to add  other Infractions to this list as they use the same wording for the
penalty.
R1023    Tardiness

R1042 - Class A crime.
Unless of course it is still virus infected, in which case it doesn't exist at
all.
Incidentally it only needs to be alleged that E has abandonded the game for Em
to be guilty of Speaker Abandonment. Shouldn't guilt be determined by judgement
of an allegation ?  Maybe my 1st Proposal should be a ratification of this rule
?

Also, what about Delayed COE Response (R1431) ?
and Infraction (R1652) (OK so maybe this one is only a typo)      ;-)

Good point !
Just out of interest, how many of these minimally actives are there ?

Hard to say.  Things have been grossly unstable of late, so it's hard
to look for behavioral patterns.  I suppose I could look at VT
transaction records for the last six months and see who has most
frequently been a transferor or transferee.

Yes, but Misappropriation carries an additional penalty (removal from
Office); thus, the original statement that it is not wholly defined in
terms of a standard class of Crime is true.

Kieron> R1042 - Class A crime.

I'll agree with this one.  The removal from the Speakership is not
concomitant with the imposition of the penalty (and, in fact, it is
not possible to impose the penalty, until and unless the Abandoning
Speaker reregisters; the Omnibus Reform Act of 1998 will fix this).

I agree with this, but: wouldn't that result in the total amount of 
VTs, P-Notes, etc. rising and falling as they're spent and minted?

All Mules are originally Idle. When you pay to turn an Idle Mule into 
a Working Mule, you choose its profession. Later, you can turn it 
into an Idle Mule again, and then into a Working Mule of a different 
type - but it costs Ergs. This is the central idea of the Plots proto 
(at least as originally envisioned).

I think it does that already.

I recommend renaming Currencies to "Commodities", or creating a 
seperate category with Currencies as a subset.

I think that the last idea would complicate things unneccessarily, 
because the owner can just give the production to the other entity.

The reason it's implemented the way it is is to cut back on 
recordkeeping. If a player doesn't have enough Ergs to pay for all 
eir Working Mules, e should turn them into Idle Mules or sell them to 
another player rather than let them be destroyed.

Again, unneccessary recordkeeping. Just give the upkeep Ergs to the 
owner, who pays with all eir other Mules.

The system is inherently inflationary.  VTs are not presently
destroyed when "spent".  Once a VT (or other unit of Currency) is
minted, the only way for it to be destroyed is for its owner to
voluntarily do so.

This is compatible with my "design" concept, I think; just requires a
slightly different approach: Working Mules have "tools" which have to
be obtained from their designer.

I don't think it will help all that much with recordkeeping.  On top
of that, it increases uncertainty risks (an error in Erg balances
could result in not merely one Mule having an unknown status, but
many, because of the all-or-nothing nature of the Rule).  And I think
it cuts off some interesting avenues for economic exploitation. :)

Again, I still don't think that the recordkeeping burden for tracking
Mule upkeep without regard to their owners is a substantial reason for
the shortcomings that system creates.  And I think I will be willing
to "go to the mat" on this one.

I have subscribed you to the three gecko mailing lists. You'll have
to subscribe yourself to the win.tue.nl list, or get Andre (the list owner)
to do it. It's a majordomo list, so to do it yourself, all you need to
do is to send mail to <majordomo@win.tue.nl> with no Subject and

subscribe

in the body of the message.

Well, actually, none, if by that term we're supposed to understand a
player who always votes exactly once per week. Which somewhat
mitigates the force of the objection in my view. Players tend either
to be more Noisy than that, voting on several Proposals, or Quiet,
voting not at all.

Does anyone have any *positive* suggestions for curbing VT supply?

No need for you to keep track of the Rules yourself; we have a Rulekeepor
for that. Cf Rules 1051, 1681. The Rulekeepor, Chuck, will be happy to
send you a copy of the Ruleset. Actually, he happens to be away until
Jan 9, so I'll bounce you a copy myself.

Intention doesn't count for much around here, I think you'll find.
Of course, reading the Ruleset at least once through is a very good
idea, just to give you a rough idea what's in it. Perhaps it's worth
reminding everyone at this point that the week of February 2-8, 1998
will be our very first officially designated 'Read the Ruleset Week',
in accordance with the newly enacted R1750. The Frankenstein Monster
(and, I regret to add, the Virus) have just been repealed, so you
probably needn't worry yourself too much about them.

There were (are?) some bios on Players on the Agora webpage, but 
they're probably well out of date. Mine hasn't changed much though:

Let me say now that I quite like Scott's idea here, and I'd like to suggest
that Murphy add it to the next revision of the Plots proto. We spent all of
1997 shaking things up 

Also, I'll mention now that I'll be willing to serve as Cartographor again
(hmmm, maybe we should change the name... "Surveyor"?) should the Plots
proposal pass.

And how would you suggest this be dealt with?

So, let me see if I understand how this would work. Each player initially
has five Mules (I can't find any place in the Proto that tells how to
acquire Plots...) They can then purchase "Tools" to make their Mule work
for 4 Ergs from the Bank, or custom tools from the Minter of a currency,
and then return those tools to the Minter to make the Mule Idle. Hmmm.

I suggest having VTs etc. be actually destroyed when used. After all, 
it makes little sense to have only Mules owned by the Bank actually 
create currency, and the rest just get it from the Bank - either all 
should actually create it, or none.

Sounds good. I'd change it so that the player actually creates the 
Tool (for 4 Ergs) with the Minter's permission (or, only Minters can 
create custom Tools), and once a Tool is given to a Mule it can only 
be destroyed, not given to a Player or other Mule (this is required 
to ensure that there's a 4 Erg cost every time a Mule changes 
profession).

Renaming a Plot doesn't change its Adjacencies.  However, I'll insert some
preliminary Longitude/Latitude wording into the next revision.

If an Organization's members are the only Players to own Plots, this would
give em an unusually good standing (transfer all Plots but one to the Org,
transfer them back, repeat several times).  I'll revise it.

This causes problems in the case of a Group or Contest winning by 
ownership. I think leaving non-Player entities out of the running is 
a better solution.

I think the Mule/Structure dicotomy (how do you spell that?) was 
better. If we really want only one name, go with Mule.

That's not the most useful definition of 'inflationary'. It doesn't
matter whether VTs are destroyed when they are spent, or whether they
just sit idle in the Bank until they are redistributed. What is
important is the number of VTs 'in circulation', ie in existence and
not possessed by the Bank. Any system which has the property of
keeping the number of VTs in circulation roughly constant will not be
inflationary in the important sense, even if the number of VTs in the
Bank is allowed to grow arbitrarily large.

My initial suggestion for preventing inflation has not been well
received. So here's another:

####
Proto-Proposal
Repeal VT Supply

Be it hereby resolved that R1684 be repealed.
####

This, of course, is not a permanent solution. But the search for a
permanent solution may well be a chimera induced by the delusion that
we can anticipate all possible future states of affairs. Nevertheless, 
in the medium term, repealing 'VT Supply' should have interesting
consequences. There are currently a touch over 1100 VTs in
circulation, or at least there will be once all current outstanding
POs for VTs have been met. This is a hell of a lot. (Once all the
Probates have been executed, this figure comes down to about 1000
VTs, but this is still a hell of a lot.) We need not fear the pangs
of scarcity for a while yet.  And VTs will continue to enter the game
at a trickle, due to Salaries and other forms of remuneration.
Certainly being an Officer will become an even more attractive
proposition, a desirable state of affairs.

It is true that VTs are not evenly distributed. In particular, Murphy,
Swann, Vir, Keiron, and especially Blob are short of VTs at the moment.
Such Players should start demanding hefty bribes for their votes, or
even for their declarations of Presence. In an environment where all
Players will be somewhat reluctant to vote, there will be considerable
pressure to meet such demands. As VTs become scarcer, such demands will
fall ever increasingly upon the richest Players: Crito, General
Chaos, Andre, Chuck, elJefe and myself. These Players will be
correspondingly more powerful, in the sense that it will be difficult
to get Proposals passed without their support. Difficult - but not
impossible. The poor, in concert with the moderately wealthy Players,
will be able to combine to defeat the rich. In the last resort, if
the rich Players abuse their power by trying to lock the poor out of
the Proposal system entirely (which would be very unwise of them),
other resources are available: Rebellion, for example. Remember that
voting for Offices is free and therefore moderately wealth-independent 
(the rich, as ever, can still offer bribes), a feature we should
keep. A candidate elected to represent the interests of the poor
would have an excellent chance of success.

In short, repealing 'VT Supply' should unleash some intriguing political
forces in the medium term, and therefore make for interesting play. Who
will support it?

Interesting. R1596:

      A Payment Order is executed when a Player with the authority to
      do so (as defined by the Rules) posts the Order to the Public
      Forum.

      A Player only has the authority to execute a Payment Order if e
      required to execute that Order by the Rules or by an Injunction,
      or if the Rules otherwise grant em authority to execute that
      Order.

Since you weren't actually Speaker, it would appear that you did not
have the authority to execute the PO that you attempted to execute.
So one possible view is that there never really was a PO to begin
with. Hence it would appear that Payment Orders are not the completely
Pragmatic things we hoped. This may or may not be news. To complete
the process of pragmatization, it would be necessary to introduce a
concept like 'presumption of authority'.

Question: assuming for the sake of argument that there never was a PO,
what would be fate of a TO made by the Chancellor to 'satisfy' it?

True.  I wasn't equating the claim that the economy would be
inflationary with my comments about the fact that the overall Currency
economy has, under the modifications to Plots I suggested, ultimate
sources but no ultimate sinks.  In a noninflationary steady state
under that system, the Bank's aggregate deposits would grow in step
with the total production.  (Interestingly, the Bank could actively
work towards reaching an approximate steady state by loaning its
deposits, or, alternatively, borrowing.)

Nevertheless, it might be interesting to introduce some sinks into the
system, if for no other reason but to keep Currency Recordkeepors from
having to keep track of millions of units of Currency in the Bank's
possession. :)

As far as your Proposal to repeal the Voting Token Supply altogether,
I will not oppose it, and might even support it, if paid well enough.
(An Indulgence or two can go a long way.)  The simpleminded Voting
Token Supply will have to go if Plots is adopted, in any case.

Yes, I have always regretted putting that clause in.  If I recall
correctly, I added it in response to concerns expressed by Michael.
The Omnibus Reform Act of 1998 remedies this problem.

Not only that, but the Player is removed from the Office in question.  That
part of the penalty is unaffected by Rule 1505's Infection.

Similarly for Misappropriation, but not Speaker Abandonment (per Scott's
argument).

However, a Player is not *convicted* of a Crime until a CFJ on the topic is
Judged TRUE, nor of an Infraction until it is reported by an authorized
person.  See Rule 1503.

I missed that one.

I'm sure it is a typo.  Would you like to Propose a fix?

"The Crime of Infraction" has no penalty (apart from becoming a Ninny).  The
sentence disabled by the typo almost certainly hasn't affected any past
Gamestate, at least; I don't believe anyone has attempted to take advantage
of it.

Sorry guys/gals (ems?), forgot to change the address list before
posting. And I did it on-line (rare for me) meant I couldn't fix it. 

Oh well, it shows that I've finally found out how to subscribe.

Bye for Now

I'm still not sure why Ranches hurt Farms. This way, having two Farms next
to a Ranch decreases both Farms while helping the Ranch... Also, shouldn't
Ranches' production be decreased by something? (I suppose it would have to
be Churches...)

This proto is nice. I'm not sure whether we should go for Scott's proposed
"everything generated by Plots" idea in the original Plot proposal or if we
should save it for after we get Plots working... 

Hmmm. I'm still not clear on how players get ownership of Plots. Also, you
need to remember to repeal R1684, so that Plots are the only existing way
to get VTs. And finally, what *did* happen to the Blob, Antimatter, and
Harlequin authorship line in the Proposal?

Specific comments:
   
1. Remove the requirement for the consent of a Plot's owner to erect a
   Structure on that Plot.  Since production goes to the owner of the
   Plot, there is no benefit gained by erecting structures on Plots
   you don't own.

2. Why does the Assessor pay out the one-time award?  Wouldn't the
   Cartographer be more appropriate?

3. In "Types of Structures", the Cartographor shall "pay out", not
   "pay".  (The present wording makes the Cartographor personally
   liable for the refund, not the Bank, as is presumably intended.)

General:

It seems more "natural" to me for the production of Mules/Structures
to be created instead of paid out.  This would, of course, require
modification to the Currency Rules.  The Commodity concept might help
with this area.  I need to think about this some more.

I vote for the latter. :)

As it stands, it'll be up to the Chancellor to establish a protocol,
since the Bank will own all of the Plots originally, and nothing
exists in the Rules to restrain the Chancellor, acting as the Bank's
Executor, from dealing in Plots.

Further, the Plots Proto as yet has failed to establish any procedures
for changing ownership of Plots; this may cause problems. :)
