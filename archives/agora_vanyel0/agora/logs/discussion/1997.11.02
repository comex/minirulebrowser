To balance the desire for consistency against the natural desire
to allow all Players to participate in one of the most fundamental
aspects of the game.

Is it your opinion then that the CotC has the power to unilaterally
make any Player Lawless simply by announcing that e is imposing a
penalty of 30 Blots on that Player? If the propriety of such an
announcement is simply not an issue as you claim, that conclusion
seems inescapable.

For myself, I should think that the correctness of the CotC's action
is not only an issue, but the major issue of substance. I happen to
think that Andre's actions were correct, at least approximately so,
and that your Judgement is therefore correct.

Well, I'm going to answer intuitively and see where things lead: you
are imposing a requirement on non-Players who wish to register to 
deposit $US20 in the bank account of Agora Inc. if they wish their
registration to be effective.

Hmmm...  Perhaps the Board could be given the power to decide if such a
penalty is warrented or not.  If they unanimously agree that the player is
just being Frivolous the penalty would be applied, otherwise not.

I disagree--although possibly only on the meaning of "wish."
Players who wish to register--even who wish to effectively
register--are not required to pay $20.  It can be my deepest
desire in the world to register, yet the above imposes no
legal obligation on me.

IMO it rests on how unambiguously "I hereby do everything required to <X>"
can be interpreted.  When <X> is "come Off Hold", and a Rule says "a Player
comes Off Hold by Moving from the Stasis Chamber", then it's clear what has
actually happened.  KoJen's statement is obviously underspecified.  In other
cases (e.g. implicit Transfer Orders) it's not necessarily as clear.

There used to be a Rule stating that all penalties normally caused by
Proposal submission (with one or two exceptions) were not caused by
Disinterested Proposals.  It's gone now, though.  Was it repealed before
or after (or during) the relevant Amendment of Rule 833?

I think the sprit is still there, and thus they still ought to be
considered Authors, even if none of the original wording remains.

In the past, it has been my practice to distribute the FLR at the
same time as the first SLR in any month.  I will not be doing so
this month, because I have several Judgements filed away which
I wish to use as the basis for unoffical Rule annotations; I hope to get
to these in the next week or so.  Once that is done, I will post
the FLR.

Some of you may be interested in reading Antonin Scalia's recently
published book, _A Matter of Interpretation_.  Justice Scalia, of
course, is writing from his perspective as Associate Justice of the
Supreme Court, but I keep finding interesting connections between what
he says and what we talk about here.

Besides, it's only $20 in hardback (and I have to read it for a class
anyway). :)

I disagree with this.  There is a distinction, within the context of
setting precedent, for a Board of Appeals to affirm with the trial
Judge by virtue of concurring with eir reasoning, and to affirm for
reasons other than those given by the trial Judge.

To an extent I would prefer that the appelate action in such cases be
limited to vacating the judgement erroneously entered, and the case be
remanded to the trial judge for reconsideration, but that would
require considerable tinkering with the trial and appeal systems, and
I don't want to do that just now.

I remind people that since Proposal 3533, later votes completely
supersede, rather than supplant, earlier votes.  (It is even possible
to withdraw one's vote altogether.)
