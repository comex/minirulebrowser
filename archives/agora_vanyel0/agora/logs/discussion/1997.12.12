It doesn't say that - you're omitting the middle part of that 
sentence, which reads in full :

      For such a Proposal, until the Voting Period has ended:
      there shall be no discussing Votes, or this Rule has been
         bended.

One might interpret "For such a Proposal, until the VP has ended" as 
establishing a period during which the two restrictions which follow 
apply, that is interpreting it as "During the VP of such a Proposal".

I think that consistency is indeed required, and that the Rule can
only be observed by effecting N distributions with the eligibility
list, as well as the amount up for distribution, computed at the
time the distribution is made; *or* with N eligibility lists and N 
distinct amounts, one for each NW to be considered.

I'm not quite sure, however, that the former interpretation is the 
correct one - to be sure, the Rule requires the Herald to perform the 
distribution at the beginning of the NW, but this clearly hasn't 
happened. Either we decide that the Herald has committed multiple 
violations of that Rule in not performing the required distributions, 
or we allow em to 'catch up', as it were, by clearing eir backlog at 
a later time, but in that case there is no compelling reason for em 
to take into account the conditions extant at the beginning of the 
relevant NWs, since that is not the time when the distributions are 
actually performed.

I also note that it is, practically, impossible to perform any action 
*at* the beginning of a Nomic Week; any Rule that requires that is 
poorly worded, and is automatically subject to some interpretation.

Grumble.  Makes things a little more difficult, but I'll do it that way if I
get a second on Scott's opinion here.

Thanks Scott.  Fortunately I still have my original eligibility lists.

It would appear that this is a somewhat contentious issue, even though
it seems rather obvious to me. :)

Indeed, I now have *three* different ways of doing things suggested to me.  8) 
However, since I do not see any argument that makes one interpretation more
favorable than another, and since the idea of fixing things is to get as close
to the "platonic" state as possible, I have decided to take Scott's method as
the one to use.  If someone has a really strong objection to this, let me know
- maybe it will require court action (I hope not).

I believe at one time ASAP actions were required to be performed

Scott: have you checked whether the results of 3601-3623 were affected
by attempted votes of non-Frankenstein Monsters?  Or are these still
correct?

No, I haven't, in part because I have no idea who was and was not a
Frankenstein Monster during the Voting Periods of these Proposals.
Perhaps the Notary can provide me with a list of FMs, including the
dates at which they acquired FM status.

I have finals coming up, and a bunch of business-related stuff to do,
and do not have the time to research all the niggly details myself at
the moment.

Fair enough.  Just as long as I know that now I can safely post the
Ruleset without any changes due to 3601-3623, since their results
haven't been reported yet.

I wouldn't bet on that.  Most of the votes on 3601 through 3613 are
likely to be unaffected by the FM issue because they were cast prior
to the amendment of the FM rule; thus, the results are correct or
substantially correct, and you would be in error to exclude them.

What if the Contest doesn't have enough VTs at that time?  Is the unpaid
award deferred until the Contest does have such funds, or are
they cancelled?

(Yes, it is possible for the contest not to have funds to pay a contestant
whose nominees have become contestants, and I don't mean by out-of-contest
Agora actions either.  Exactly how is left as an exercise for the reader.)

You're probably right, especially as I seem to remember a Game
Custom that "the results of voting on that Proposal" in R376
refers only to the passage or failure of a Proposal, and not
the actual votes.  (Although admittedly my memory is a bit hazy
here; comments?)  From my records (no guarantees), the only votes
that are incorrectly reported on 3601-3613 are Morendil's votes
on 3604 and 3609, and these do not affect the results of those
proposals.

I see what you mean... Nasty loophole there. There is another bug in
these Regulations by the way: What will happen to Regulation 3 when all 
Agorans decide to become Contestants?

Thanks for the quick response--but I think there's a couple missing.
At least, I have no record of these people ever being FMs:

Morendil's votes on 3601-3623
Steve's on 3614-3623
elJefe's on 3614-3623

So he did.  I was a day off in comparing his voting message to

I think I have seen a report on that bug from somewhere - Albania, I think
it was.  According to the report, it apparently will crash the whole game.

(Note proto near the end of this message.)

When P3538, Restore Game Balance II, was originally believed to
have passed, I assigned the Rule it created the number 1741.

Then it was believed that P3538 failed, thus meaning (so we
believed) that there never had been a R1741, and the next
Rule to be created should receive the number 1741.  Before anyone
else mentions it, I'll note R1349:

Rule 1349/0 (Power=2)
Rule Numbering

      The Rulekeepor shall give each newly-enacted Rule a Number for
      reference when it is created.  The Number of a Rule shall be the
      least integer greater than all other Numbers previously given to
      a Rule (including numbers assigned to Rules later determined to
      have been incorrectly enacted), or 301, whichever is greater.

      Once a Rule has been given a Rule Number, it shall not be
      changed except as specified in the Rules.

Although it might have been the intent of the proposer of the
proposal which created R1349 that in such a case the next rule
be given the number 1742, it is my contention that this is incorrect,
as "Rules later determined to have been incorrectly enacted" is
meaningless.  Thus, when Proposal 3555 passed, I assigned it
the number 1741.

Now, the question is, does the Rule created by P3555--"A Public
Voting Experiment"--have the number 1741 or 1742?  R1349
seems to contradict itself in this regard.  The first
and third sentence seem to say it retains the erroneous number:

      The Rulekeepor shall give each newly-enacted Rule a Number for
      reference when it is created. [...]
      Once a Rule has been given a Rule Number, it shall not be
      changed except as specified in the Rules.

But the second seems to imply that it does not:

                                     The Number of a Rule shall be the
      least integer greater than all other Numbers previously given to
      a Rule (including numbers assigned to Rules later determined to
      have been incorrectly enacted), or 301, whichever is greater.

Either interpretation can wreak havoc with P3634, "Permanent Public
Voting."  If "A Public Voting Experiment" is numbered 1741, then
if P3634 passes, its attempted amendment will be rejected as ambiguous,
unless the other R1741, "Restore Game Balance II", has repealed
itself by then (which is entirely possible).  If "A Public Voting
Experiment" is numbered 1742, then P3634 will definitely not have
its intended effect.

Which is it?  I might make a CFJ, but instead I've decided to make
a unilateral ruling, and let anyone who disagrees with me make a
CFJ.  It is my interpretation that "A Public Voting Experiment"
retains the number 1741, and thus there are, for the moment, two
Rules 1741.  I note that neither interpretation is entirely
satisfactory; one has two Rules 1741, while the other can cause
whole-scale renumbering of large groups of Rules.  As much as I
dislike the "best interests of the game" standard, I think it
is in the best interests of the game not to have large
renumberings of Rules (the numbers of R1742-1748 would also all
be incremented) so that in general, proposal authors are
proposing to change the Rules they think they're changing.
In this particular case I note that Restore Game Balance II
will repeal itelf before too much longer; also, in such
a case, changes to one of these Rules could be unambiguously
specified by noting both the number and title of the Rule.

(I'm starting to not dislike "the best interests of the game"
so much :)

Assessor Scott, I would encourage you to report the transfers
required by Restore Game Balance II before announcing the
Results of P3634, so that there will be no ambiguity in its
meaning.

I also proto the following:

============================================================
ProtoProposal Chuck111
Plato-Pragmatize "Rule Numbering"

I request that this Proposal have AI=2.

Rule 1349 is hereby amended to read:

      The Rulekeepor shall assign each newly-enacted Rule a Number for
      reference when it is created by announcing such an assignment
      in the Public Forum.  (This may be done implicitly, e.g.,
      posting a Ruleset wherein the Rule is listed as having that
      number, but still requires a post to the Public Forum for
      the assignment to have effect.)

      The Number which the Rulekeepor assigns to a Rule shall be the
      least integer greater than any other Number previously assigned
      to a Rule, or Number which the Rulekeepor believed in good
      faith e was assigning to a Rule.  However, if the Rulekeepor
      assigns an incorrect Number to a Rule, the Rule retains that
      Number.

Hadn't we just abolished that one? Or was it abolished by
