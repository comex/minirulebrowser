I said that I'd dealt with all of the CFJs on my files, which was
true.  Unfortunately, I must never have picked up on the message in
question being a CFJ.  (I remember seeing the message itself because
it was one where Swann apologised so profusely for committing his
Crime.)

As should be obvious from my actions, I believe Steve's CFJ to be
false.  Things seem to me to hinge on the nature of the word
"specific".  Game custom provides an interpretation already: we allow
people to exempt themselves from a CFJ if they can specify which CFJs
they wish to be exempt from.  Antimatter's "all those that arise until
I specify otherwise" is fine because one can always determine whether
or not he should be eligible for a CFJ that comes up.  (I further
believe that Harlequin can override his earlier very broad
specification, by posting again, but that's not quite the issue that
Steve's CFJ addresses.)

I certainly don't see why 
  "'A specific CFJ' can only refer to a CFJ which already exists in
  the full particularity of its details: its text, who called it, and
  when it was called."  
I can refer to a specific Player by stating that he has initials
S.G. and lives in Australia without having to go into his full details
(d.o.b., mother's maiden name etc)..

Anyway, over to you Kolja.

Michael.

The delay in this CFJ brings to mind an idea I had a while back.  Should we
have a Statute of Limitation. (In this case it wouldn't apply since the
charge was filed promptly even though action has been delayed).  Can you
imagine the difficulties it could cause to allege that a crime occurred two
years ago?

After a couple of recent "accidental" Infractions, I thought the following
proto might be appropriate:

Proto: Appealing for Leniency

Create a rule entitled "Appealing for Leniency" with text:

     A Player who has, in the past week, been reported as having

     to the Public Forum, explaining why e deserves to be treated

Interesting.  VTs have become so scarce now that most Players are unable or
unwilling to barter with them and P-Notes don't seem to be worth much since
it's so hard to get a proposal passed these days.  Hmm, I wonder where this
will lead.  Well, I'll speculate and trade one Indulgence for each P-Note.

Quite so.  I drew 5 more random numbers, this time in the range from 0 to 352. 
Since 352 did not show up at all, consider the probabilities to have been
corrected and the last R-O-M posting to be official.

Greetings!

I thought I'd mention that I had lunch with Malcolm "Blob" Ryan
yesterday.  He's in Madison for a couple of AI conferences.
Quite an enjoyable meeting, discussing topics nomic and non-nomic.
Now that I'm certain that he's not an amorphous blob of goo,
though, it'll be difficult for me to think of him as "Blob"
any more. :)

On another note, I won't be in Madison much longer.  I've
accepted a job with Eli Lilly & Co. in Indianapolis, and
in fact I'm leaving for there later this afternoon to start
looking for a place to live.  (Maybe I'll have to go
down to Bloomington some time and meet Scott.)  This shouldn't
affect my net access, except from Aug. 11-16 when I'll be
in Atlanta, and I'm not sure whether I'll have net access from
there.  (My trip to Atlanta is actually unrelated to my move.
There's a good idea, Chuck, take a vacation right in the middle
of a move.)

So why the strong connection between Indiana and Nomic?
* Peter Suber is a professor at Earlham College, in Indiana.
  (Another position I had applied for was at Earlham College.
  I was kind of hoping I'd get that so I'd have an excuse to
  meet Dr. Suber. :)
* When Douglas Hofstadter wrote his SciAm column on Nomic, he
  was a professor at Indiana University.
* Scott is a student at Indiana University.
* I grew up in Indiana and am now returning there.

Coincidence?  Conspiracy?  You decide.

Chuck

Since I didn't ever consider the practice until others brought this issue
up, I consider that last sentence to be spurious and bordering on the
disHonorable.

I seem to recall that some of the purpose of our current Order system was
to ensure that errors like this had no effect, thus at least making it
legal to shove this under the carpet.  I will have to defer to someone
more acquainted with the system in order to decide whether it succeeds in
this particular case.

Of course not, but I'll just add it as a trailer to something else 
more interesting. I just want to know whether anyone would be strongly

You had lunch with Malcolm Ryan, and he enjoyed it very much.
But he is just one of my agents. I'm sorry that I could not be 
there in person, but travel is rather difficult for amorphous
blobs of mauve goo. And catering is a nightmare. :)

Of course, this isn't really necessary in light of the fact that Swann
admits the crime.  However, since the Judge asked, I intend to  prepare a
summary of the relevant messages but am unable to locate Swann's "No New
Player Tyranny" message.  If someone has that message and could send it
along, I'll complete my summary and submit it to the Judge.

TIA.

I think that the original suggestion was looking to have an account which
was read by the officer, as opposed to having it forward (especially since
most free email access cannot be forwarded).  I don't think that using web
locations is a viable solution; I certainly would not like to have to open
a web browser to do officer business.  However, creating accounts on some
machine for officers to use might be a good solution; Officers could
forward messages to their own accounts, and still leave copies of all mail
in the Officer account.  This would allow officers to keep track during
transistions, and would also allow for easy archival.  I can have a linux
machine available for this in the near future (assuming that I don't let
the smoke out of this motherboard :-), which would be a mostly dedicated
machine, if no one else has a situation where the want to create an extra
dozen accounts.

(I'm annoyed; I read through a good part of the rules, had some reasonable
scam ideas, and rule fixes -- so I might have been able to actually make a
proposal -- and RL went to hell in a handbasket.  Maybe later).

Did I ever receive 5 points for becoming Cartographor? I think I only
got points for winning the Assessor and Archivist Elections.

You misunderstand me. Of course you can refer to me as "the Australian
Player with initials S.G.", but that is only because I exist and am
already a Player. My point is that this description succeeds in picking
out a specific Player, an existing person with a date of birth, a mother
with a maiden name, and so on. But there is no way to pick out a merely
hypothetical Player.

R897 (Barring Players from Judgement), for example, allows you to
specify up to 3 Players to be barred from Judging a CFJ. So imagine that
I now make a CFJ, and indicate that I wish to bar "the American Player
with the initials Z.S.". You would quite rightly complain that there is
no such Player. But now imagine that just after I make the CFJ, an
American, Zachary Smith, registers to play. Now there is a Player
matching my description, but Zachary would be quite right to object that
there was no reason to think that I had asked that *he* be barred
specifically. Why not think I was referring to his wife Zoe? "The
American Player with the initials Z.S.", in advance of there being such
a Player, does not specify a Player. Similarly, "all CFJs called in the
next two weeks" does not specify a CFJ.

Was the original Judge selected Harlequin? If it was, then the remarks
below are not relevant, except indirectly in that I believe (and Kolja
has now Judged) that you were mistaken in thinking that Harlequin was
ineligible to Judge this CFJ.

If I recall correctly, you said that you re-ordered the list of eligible
Players, and kept the old dice roll. This practice departs from the
standard way of dealing with such cases, and I think it causes problems.

The standard way of dealing with such cases is to keep the original
selection, and roll a new die with the Player mistakenly left out of
the list assigned the appropriate probability. In this case, that would
have meant rolling a 12-sided die, assigning Macross one of the numbers,
say, 1, and rolling the die, selecting Macross as Judge on a roll of 1,
and keeping the original Judge otherwise.

We have an illustration of the problems with your method in the next
CFJ, 1101. Kolja was selected to Judge this CFJ. Assuming that you used
the same eligibility list as above, you must have used a 12 sided die
and rolled a 5. Now, let's say that in light of Kolja's Judgement, you
admitted that you were mistaken in excluding Harlequin as a possible
Judge of the CFJ, and decided to see if the selection of a new Judge was
warranted. Now your method runs straight into paradox, for Harlequin
would be the 5th Player on your eligibility list, and hence be the new
Judge, which would mean that Kolja's Judgement was invalid, which would
mean that you had no (legal) reason to change the eligibility list, and
so on. Using the standard method, you'd roll a new die, with 12 chances
in 13 of a paradox being averted (Harlequin has to be added to the list
of eligible Players, making 13).

Now, an objection to the above argument is that it rests on Harlequin's
happening to be the 5th Player on the eligibility list, a purely
contingent fact about Harlequin. If Harlequin had chosen the name
'Bachner' instead (curiously 'Josh' and 'Hall-Bachner' are also
lexicographically between 'General Chaos' and 'Kolja A.'), then your
method does not lead straight to paradox as I allege. But this objection
exposes a more profound difficulty with your method of replacement, and
that is that it gets the probabilities wrong, or at the very least, it
makes it very difficult to ascertain that they are right. For what we
want is that Harlequin should be assigned a 1/13 chance being selected
as a Judge, the same probability that he would have had of being
selected had he not been erroneously left off the eligibility list. The
standard method straightforwardly secures this. But what reason is there
to think that Pr(Harlequin is selected | a 5 is rolled) = 1/13 ? None
that I can see. Rather, this probability seems to be the a priori
probability that Harlequin's name happens to be such that it comes 5th
on your list, and this probability will vary considerably depending on
what Harlequin's name happens to be, and what other names are on the
list. Another way of making the same point is to ask how your method 
would cope had it been me, Steve, instead of Harlequin, who'd been left
off the list. On your method of replacement, the probability that I get
selected as a Judge is zero, since I come 13th on the list, and the
probability of rolling a 13 on a 12 sided die is zero.
