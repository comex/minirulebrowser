Especially when you consider its origins in the Mousetrap scandal,

Yeah. Speaking of which, would you like to dig out the Plots proto and propose 
it, or something?

Uhm... fine. I think I can deal with that. I will propose plots as an addition, 
though (possibly with Locations instead of Plots).

Right. It _will_ take some tinkering to balance it right, and as needs change, 
supply has to change as well. I like the Plots idea because it allows excess 
production capacity to be taken up by producing extra MT (allowing people to 
diversify - but those who don't are better off, and allowing people to change 
"jobs") and building Churches (which provide their owner with more Indulgences, 
but don't actually _produce_ anything).

Right. The fun part of Nomic is, you keep tinkering with the rules until you 
get it right - and then you tinker some more, because it's so much fun.

Hey Harlequin, how about forming a Paladins of Chaos contest? With the object 
of introducing as much unfairness, randomness, and general chaos (not to be 
confused with General Chaos) into the game as possible? :-)

Why? We've got nothing against Groups. We may have something against some
of its aberrations like Unity Votes, but then we could still decide not to
use them, or use the excuse that we are 'fighting the system from within'.

Quite. In spite ofmy epressed interests in politicking, I have never enjoyed
Diplomacy. I always feel that I should enjoy it, but end up feeling hurt 
and betrayed. 

Part of the difference is that around here you can find others who 
genuinely share your interests and will fight with you. Finding a trust-
worthy ally in a game of Diplomacy is pretty much impossible.

Antimatter, a word of advice:

Some of your messages are rather garbled when they reach my end. I 
think that this is because you use more the 80 characters on a line.
I don't know about the other players, but that can stuff around with
my terminal quite annoyingly. Could you please make sure you insert
a newline every 70 characters or so?

I am waiting for Pragmatic Currencies to pass. (And I don't have a lot of
free nomic-playing time at the moment.)

As soon as that is underway, and the Plot's proto is reworded appropriately,
I'll propose it. I am not particularly interested in linking it with 
Agoraspace, and I see that as a separate concept which can be implemented
later.

Anyone like the idea of unlimited VT spending on proposals? :)

My mailer automatically wraps lines (that is, adds a return) after 80 
characters (that's out to ----------------------------------------------->here)
but doesn't do that to things I quote. It's also possible to fool it into 
putting more than 80 characters in a line, but I don't. Of course, it may be 
the case that your terminal doesn't like lines of more than 72 characters, 
which might be a problem.

I use Pegasus Mail for Windows, if that's any help. Oh, and that long line 
above is actually only 79 characters (Pegasus counts the newline in the 80 
characters or something, I think - it has similar problems counting with tab 
stops).

Ack. I support unlimited VT spending only if the number of VTs needed to get a 
specific number of votes increases RAPIDLY - at least quadratic, preferably 
exponential.

If you can cut this to 70, you might want to.  70 is the generally
accepted maximum standard for width on the net.
