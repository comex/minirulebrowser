      "Active" is an unambiguous synonym for "Off Hold".

["Active" is used broadly in the Rules, but never defined.]

Protoproposal Chaos13 [rev. 1]

No Passing the Buck

Be it therefore resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      A Recordkeepor may refuse to record a Transfer Order or Payment
      Order, the amount of which is not specified as a fixed numeral.
      If a Recordkeepor agrees to record a Transfer Order or Payment
      Order which is not specified as a fixed numeral, the value which
      the Recordkeepor determines to be correct at the time e records
      that Transfer Order or Payment Order is the amount of that
      Order, even if the Recordkeepor's determination is erroneous.

[This is to prevent Players from stating that they "execute whatever
 Payment Orders they are required to execute" or "transfer all but two
 VTs to some entity", thereby transferring the responsibility to
 determine what they are legally required to do to Recordkeepors,
 and/or creating uncertainty in Currency Records by specifying
 contingent transfer amounts.]

1006 and 790 both seek to define what it is to *hold* an Office, and in
that battle, 790 does trump 1006.

AHA!  You see, you silly mountain bikers have NO respect for ANY
environment.

Obviously, Mountain Bikers are not content with leaving non
Bio-degradeable junk and footprints  (which are STILL there, I might
add) on the Moon.  It is a FACT that NASA engineers, in the majority,
own bicycles, and in fact, even BUY THEM FOR THIER CHILDREN!

This is FACT.  It is OBVIOUS.  You are IGNORANT if you do not agree.
There is RESEARCH that proves my point.  EVERYONE I know agrees with
me!

Of course, once you get a child started, they have to buy BIGGER bikes
with more capabilities, which leads to ... you guessed it, more
Mountain Bikers that wish to go into space.  But I digress.

These NASA Mountain Bike types are not content to destroy the pristine
environment of the earth, or even the moon.  They have to continuously
attack Mars.  Yes, that's right, this is not the first time.  Remember
the Viking Lander in 1975?  Right.  Mountain Bikers dumping more junk
into a pristine environment. (You Russian Mountain Bikers are no
better, your Phobos landers are still there, and they never even
worked.)

Now, the ultimate insult has occured.  We have a device that is the
equivalent of THREE Mountain Bikes (That's right, six wheels) tearing
up the terrain for miles in every direction!  Sure, the people at NASA
say it only moves a tiny bit a day, but I have proof that is no true!
Liars!  And in the process, The Martian Bikers claim to "see" the
wildlife around it!  It can't possibly be "seeing" such long
recognized Landmarks as "Barnicle Bill" or "Yogi" because it is MOVING
TOO FAST!!  It's OBVIOUS!

But I have a plan.  I know how to take care of this destruction of
environments before it gets out of hand.  You can join me, and
together, we can preserve these unique habitats for the creatures that
have to live there.

Just Watch me.

Apparently you know other kooks than I do. The only capitalization styles
I regularly see are:

- Normal capitalization throughout
- Title in all caps, normal capitalization otherwise
- Everything in all caps
- Insults in caps, normal capitalization otherwise

Earlier this year I looked into this to see the historic development
of our number of Players. Thus I can check the '<1997' dates back to early
1995. All those dates can be one month off.

I would extend "...to which a Rule assigns any duties." to "to which a
Rule assigns any duties or rights," and add "...unless another Rule
specifically says a non-Player may hold that position." Maybe it would
be better to remove the last sentence, and instead make this a Power 2
Rule.

It's been quite interesting trying to cope with the various implications of
candidates being deregisted (and then getting elected), of Executors in
Probate who are not Players, etc.  But it could get quite tricky, and I
fear the game is actually close to degenerating into unjudgeable
controversy.

In the interest of clarity, I offer the following:

====================================================================
ProtoProposal
No nonplayer responsibilities

Create a rule reading:

When a player becomes deregistered, e ceases to be a candidate, officer,
judge, or executor in probate, or in general to occupy any role or position
to which a Rule assigns any duties.  Noone who is not registered may occupy
such a role or position.  This rule takes precedence over rules which would
prevent em from ceasing to occupy such a role or position.

Suggestion: when a Player is deregisterede or other Entity destroyed,
create a new Entity known as an Estate.  This seems to me to
make more sense than the kludge of P3581.

A good idea, but a couple of flaws:

1) You are merely permitting the Recordkeepor to falsify the report of the
Currency holdings/Order status, rather than adjust them.

Of course, this merely is a part of an oversight with the Pragmatic
Currencies:  We are long overdue for a philosophy reconciliating Rule that
says that the Recordkeepor's Records _are_ the Currency Holdings, except
to the degree that the Recordkeepor has falsified them on purpose or
through gross negligence.  Maybe I should make a Proto.

2) This might actually conflict with Rule 754.  I would not be adverse to
a similar rewriting of that Rule, however - witness KoJen's recent C
programming attempts.

Recently elJefe had the idea that cancelling votes doesn't only save
VTs, but also helps to oppose proposals because they simply fail
quorum, if enough against votes are withdrawn.

I applaud em for this creative game move, and as I've said before, I
consider the appearance of similar tactics a major success for the
Public Voting experiment.

However, consistent application of this tactics would also effectively
change the requirement needed to get proposals through from a simple
majority of all votes cast to an absolute majority of active players,
which is needed to reach quorum if all opponents simply abstain.

Several people have suggested lowering the quorum as a way to avoid
this. I have two problems with this suggestion: 

1. It's a rather dull (and, may I say, Agora-typical) way to eliminate
a creative tactic as soon as it appears. End result: same procedures
as before, but with more complexity and red tape involved.

2. I've always considered nominally democratic systems with very low
quorum a bit of a contradiction. If this is a game about voting,
democratically, we should expect players to do it. If they don't want
to, or if we want to install an aristo- or whateverocracy, let's
change the rules accordingly.

Really, the problem is not so much elJefe's new tactics, but the fact
that some players have not been voting recently - Calabresi and Vanyel
come to mind. But this problem can be solved with the absence
mechanism.

I would like to play more with potentially interesting variations of
elJefe's tactics, and would therefore prefer to leave quorum as it
is. Why not follow Murphy's suggestion

This would provoke more interesting game tactics, as Steve noticed
quite correctly (although he called that "It won't work", I would look
forward to such a situation):

>>
It'll just intensify the race condition already inherent
in Public Voting: everybody'll try not to vote until the last minute,
so they can see what everyone else is doing.

What's so bad about such races? There is some risk involved (cf the
one vote (Crito's, I think) on 3581 which was 3 minutes late), the
exact time of the end of the voting period becomes important (who can
afford to stay awake until 15 minutes before the deadline), so the
promotor has some power to manipulate things. Lots of territory to
explore.

What beliefs have changed? Note e.g. your earlier message:
