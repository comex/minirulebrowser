"required by law"?? shouldn't this read "required by the rules", or do 
we actually have laws in Agora.

I should probably somewhere define what I mean by this phrase.  In a
common law jurisdiction "the law" means all positive statutes,
constitutions, rules, and regulations, plus rules of law established
by judgment.  In Agora I would interpret this phrase to encompass the
Rules, any subordinate regulations which may from time to time be
enacted, all Orders, and also all Judgements which establish rules of
law; it is therefore broaders than "the Rules".

Blob, this is fine but actually, if it hasn't been satisfied, you can
just amend the initial PO.  This makes it easier on the Recordkeepor
(at least for me).
