In my opinion it would be legal for you to list all the Players
from whom you have received votes or declarations of Presence
on Proposals currently up for vote, including information about when
those votes were cast, in accordance with R452, provided that for
each Player, you do not indicate whether it was a vote or a
declaration of Presence you received from that Player, and that you
list all the Players who have voted or declared Presence, regardless
of when they voted.  Nothing prevents you, in my opinion, from
splitting the list into those who voted before, and those who voted
after, P3533 took effect.

I'm not clear on whether it's permissible to lump together the
Salaries payable to Players who hold multiple Officers.  

I'm also not convinced that this posting satisfies the requirements of
Rule 1596 for the execution of Payment Orders.  You might need to add
"The Bank is directed to pay the above salaries as indicated" (or
similar language) in order for there to be an "order" in your message.
As it stands, you've merely reported what the salaries of the various
Officers are, without actually commanding their payment.

It appears that Proposal Notes and Indulgences may have ceased to
exist with the adoption of Proposal 3533.  Rule 1579/1 made the Mintor
of a Currency the Mint if no other specification existed.  Rule 1579/2
makes no such specification.  Neither Proposal Notes nor Indulgences
have a specified Mintor anywhere in the Rules; prior to Pr.3533 they
were therefore minted by the Mint through R.1579/1's default clause.
I suspect that, as a result of this, neither Proposal Notes nor
Indulgences have Mintor, and therefore fail to meet R.1579/2's
requirement of having a Mintor.

Suppose, however, we argue that the Mint remains the Mintor of these
Currencies.  This is still a problem, as the Mint also ceased to
exist, and more importantly ceased to have Mint Authority, with the
adoption of Pr.3533.  And Rule 1579/2 requires that a Currency be
destroyed if its Mintor ceases to exist or ceases to have Mint
Authority.

Note that this does not prohibit the making of Proposals; it only
prohibits the making of Interested Proposals.  It also breaks the Blot
systems badly, but that's not critical to the operation of the Game.
Voting Tokens are unaffected; Rule 1696 specifically states that the
Mintor of VTs is the Bank.

Unless 1431 has changed significantly while I wasn't looking, it says

      A Response to a Claim of Error consists in posting to the Public
      Forum either a denial of the Claim, or an admission of the
      Claim, which shall then include a corrected version of the
      portion of the relevant message which was in error.  A Response
      denying a Claim may be superseded by a second Response admitting
      that Claim.

A _portion_ of the message, not the whole thing.

What I don't like about this is

      Whenever a Player's Style points exceeds eir High Style Mark by
      two or more points, the Wizard shall pay out to that Player a
      reward of one P-Note for every two points in excess of eir current
      High Style Mark and eir High Style Mark shall be increased by two
      times the number of P-Notes awarded.

Doesn't that give the wizard the power to freely hand our P-notes to
everyone e likes, provided only that that player makes some proposals
and the wizard can come up with some rhetorics to praise these
proposals? 

I thought that so far the wizard and style points were only a matter
of, well, style and fun, like kudos, but without a tangible influence
of the game state.

Yes.  I haven't been too crazy about the way the Wizard's have handled this in
the past myself (a previous Wizard used them to "punish" me for my Win by
Proposal scam, which required me to submit a large number of identical
proposals).  And I just lost a Style Point on this for making an honest
mistake, which is easily rectified.  So it goes.  But there does seem to be a
consensus that Officers should have some real power and this fits in with that
notion.

No.  This provision is already a part of the Rules (R1705, you get P-Notes once
a month for having positive style).  Actually, if I remember the discussion on
this, it was precisely for this reason that Players voted in this reward - to
give Style Points a tangible influence on the game state.

Hmm.  I note that Indulgences are created and defined as a Currency by R1435
which takes precedence over R1579, so I would say Indulgences continue to exist
(although they may have no Mintor).  P-Notes however, are defined in R1701, so
you can't make the same argument for them.

Opposed.  These is an automagic change in currency holdings, and I am
strongly opposed to such things.  If you want units of currency
created or destroyed, require the Bank to do so; this will create an
obligation for the Chancellor to perform as required.

As long as you're cleaning up, there's now an instance of the
word "BIrth" in R1727 that should be "Birthday".  Here's the
relevant paragraph:

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Chancellor shall, on behalf of
      the Bank, submit Transfer Orders for one P-note each from the
      Bank to each Player who posts to the Public Forum during Agora's
      BIrth a message recognizing Agora's Birthday; these Transfer
      Orders to be executed as soon as possible after Agora's Birthday
      ends;

Hmmmm. The Chancellor *can* create and destroy units of currency if the
Bank is required to do so, can't e? Hmmm. Well, then, if I change the
language of this PROTO to merely require that the Bank perform these
actions, rather than actually cause them to occur, will that be acceptable?

And do you have a suggestion on how to handle situations where the Bank has
a negative balance of Indulgences?

Yes.

It should not be possible for an entity to have a negative number of
units of any Currency, except by a Proposal actually directly
adjusting someone's balance to be negative.  The Bank may presently
have a negative number of some Currencies, since the Bank was not
rectified by Proposal 3533; if this is the case, I will probably mint
sufficient units of those Currencies to cancel such negative balances.

It may not be necessary to have negative balances (and it looks like Scott will
use the Chancellor's powers to prevent it anyway).  Something along the lines:

"Whenever Blots are created, the Herald shall calculate the surplus of Blots
equal to the number of Blots minus the number of Indulgences.  If this surplus
is greater than one, the Herald shall require the Bank to create enough
Indulgences to reduce this surplus to one."

"Whenever Fugitive Blots are created, and after the original Blots have been
vacated, the Herald shall calculate the surplus of Indulgences equal to one
plus the number of Indulgences minus the number of Blots.  If this surplus is
greater than zero, the Herald shall require the Bank to destroy either the
total number of Indulgences held by the bank or a number of Indulgences equal
to this surplus, whichever is less."

How does this sound?

What I meant was "Do you have a suggestion on how to handle situations
where there are more Indulgences than there should be, where the Bank would
have had negative Indulgences previously?" I think if I'm going to make
this Proposal, I should include the provisions to keep Indulgence numbers
stabilized in there, but I couldn't figure out any way to do it other than
to create a special situation. I would have just had the Bank have Payment
Orders to itself, which would have simplified the entire thing
significantly, but the rule defining POs prevents that by using the word
"other." Actually, I must say I think that would probably be the simplest
way to handle it -- is there any particular problem in having the same
Entity be both the payor and payee for a PO? If not, I may just delete the
"other" and solve the problem that way.

This is nice, except that it should probably be every time the Herald
publishes a report, regardless of the creation of Blots -- direct changes
and other bizzarities can cause changes as well. But yes, good.

Again, I think it's better to have catch-all phrasing in these to keep the
Indulgence balance even at all times. As for this system, as mentioned in
my other e-mail, I may suggest that we just go to a "self-directed PO"
system for this, as it'll standardize the whole thing and make this Rule so
much simpler -- if there are too many Blots, the Bank makes Indulgences, if
there are too many Indulgences, the Bank gets issued Blots.
