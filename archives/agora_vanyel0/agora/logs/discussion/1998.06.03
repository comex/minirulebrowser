In the tradition of several recent Judges, I am offering my intended
judgement for comments before official submission.  Note that this is
_not_ an official submission of a Judgement.

Rule 1586 defines:

      A "Nomic Entity" is any entity which has no discernible
      existence without the Rules, only existing by virtue of the
      Rules defining it to exist.  No two Nomic Entities (including
      Players) shall have the same name or nickname.

Rule 1793 defines:

      An Order is a command, executed by a Player and directed to some
      entity requiring that entity to perform exactly one action, or
      to refrain from performing one or more actions.

It is my view that a command as above clearly has discernible existence
without the rules - it would be quite possible to make such even if Rule
1793 did not exist.  Thus the part of the statement

'An Order, as defined in Rule 1793, and of whatever type, is "a Nomic
Entity created in accordance with the Rules" in the sense of Rule
1513 and as such is subject to the limitations set forth in that
Rule,'

is false.

It is equally clear that the validity and coercive power (through
penalties) of an Order is derived from the Rules.  So the part of the
statement

'and in particular that Orders derive coercive power from some Rules'

is true.  

While the above suffices to determine the Judgement, there are more subtle
issues here, which I wish to detail.  Rule 1513 says:

      It is legal for the Rules to grant the power to require Players
      to perform (or not perform) actions to Nomic Entities created in
      accordance with the Rules.

It is my view that the Rules do _not_ grant such power to Orders.  Compare
the situation for Orders with that of Subordinate Legal Codes:

>From Rule 1591:

      A SLC has the power to constrain the actions of Players in
      the same manner as the Rules.

>From Rule 1594:

      A Player who is within the Jurisdiction of a SLC is required to
      abide by it while e remains within its Jurisdiction, unless
      doing so would violate either the Rules or another SLC with
      higher precedence.


For SLCs, there is a clear granting of powers and requirements.  For
Orders, however, there are only defined Crimes for non-compliance.

In my view, a Crime is not automatically a Rule violation, and thus the
Rules do not in fact require Orders to be followed in the same way as an
SLC.

Thus, the part of the statement

'and that the Rules take precedence over Orders whenever an Order
conflicts with a Rule.'

is true, in the sense that Players, in order to comply with the Rules, may
have to commit a Crime by disobeying an order; however not in the sense
that the entire Order and its penalty is escaped because of the conflict.

I know that several Players think that Crimes should be automatic Rule
Violations, but I think that matter is better settled by legislation.

However, regardless of this issue in particular, at least one part of the
statement is false. 

I therefore judge FALSE.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

H. Scorekeepor,

As a result of the above Blots, Harlequin and Murphy each lose 6 points.

Agorans may be interested to know that Peter Suber, the inventor of
Nomic, has placed the text of his book,  _The Paradox of Self-Amendment_, 
on the Web. This is *the* book for Nomic theoreticians. You can find it at:
