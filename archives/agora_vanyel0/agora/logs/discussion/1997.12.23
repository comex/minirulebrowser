I don't know if it's neccesarily appropriate to use the same standard for
interpreting R1729 as is used for "regular" rules. The FM has already
created a precedence for, uh, liberal interpretation of Rules written in
non-standard ways.

I didn't say I was done.  The judicial system needs serious reworking
in relation to appeals.

I would have the trial Judge issue a Sentencing Order imposing the
penalty.  The Clerk of the Courts would stay then that Order should an
appeal be initiated, and the Order would be vacated should the Trial
Court find the Judgement (or the Order) to be in error.

Obviously, this would require some changes to the judicial system;
I'll get to work on them as I have time. :)

I assume this parallels the disputation and possible vacation of an erroneous
Payment Order.  One difference, though:  If I pay a PO for 2 VTs that is
later vacated, I get my 2 VTs back (although I was still denied their use
in the interim, and that doesn't get changed).  If a Sentencing Order for
suspension of Voting privileges goes into effect and is later vacated, how
are my Voting privileges "repaid"?  Do I get free Votes on a number of
Proposals equal to the number of Proposals on which I was wrongly denied the
ability to Vote?  Or, probably more reasonably, would Sentencing Orders be
set up so that they cannot take effect till after the time limit on Appeals
has expired?  (Analogous to a PO for 2 VTs being vacated before it's paid;
such a PO never changes anyone's VT holdings.)

Protoproposal Chaos22 [rev. 1]

Crimes and Infractions

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1503 be amended to read:

      Any Player who commits an act defined by the Rules to be a Crime
      shall be subject to whatever penalty the Rules prescribe for
      that Crime upon the issuance of a Sentencing Order issued
      consequent to a judicial finding that e did in fact commit that
      Crime.

      Any Player who commits an act defined by the Rules to be an
      Infraction shall be subject to whatever penalty the Rules
      prescribe for that Infraction upon a Notice of Infraction
      stating that e committed that Infraction.

      The failure to perform some action when required to do so is,
      for the purpose of this Rule, an act subject to the provisions
      of this Rule.

      A Notice of Infraction stating that a Player has committed a
      specific Infraction consists of a report by a Player authorized
      to report instances of that specific Infraction that it is eir
      informed belief that the specified Player has committed the
      specified Infraction.  A Notice of Infraction shall also specify
      the penalty to be imposed for that Infraction.

      No act is a Crime or an Infraction unless defined as such by the
      Rules.  If the Rules define an act to be a Crime or an
      Infraction, but fail to prescribe a penalty for that act, then
      there is no penalty for that act.  If the Rules define an act to
      be an Infraction, but fail to authorize any Player or Players to
      report instances of that Infraction, then that Infraction cannot
      be reported.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1504 be amended to read:

      The imposition of penalties for the commission of a Crime shall
      be by Sentencing Order.  The Judge of a CFJ, the statement of
      which alleges that a Player has committed a Crime, shall issue a
      Sentencing Order sufficient to implement the penalty required by
      the Rules for that Crime, if and only if that CFJ is judged
      TRUE.  Such Orders are Judicial Orders.

      The imposition of penalties for the commission of an Infraction
      shall be by the issuance of a Notice of Infraction.  The Player
      issuing the Notice of Infraction shall, at the time e does so,
      also issue Orders sufficient to implement the penalty required
      by the Rules for that Infraction.  Such Orders are
      Administrative Orders.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1652 be amended to read:

      No Player shall be subject to penalties more than once for a
      single instance of a particular Crime or Infraction, any other
      Rule notwithstanding.

      Any CFJ whose Statement alleges that a Player has, through
      action or inaction, committed a Crime shall be dismissed if
      there is a prior CFJ, the statement of which alleges that the
      same Player has, through the same action or inaction, committed
      the same Crime, and which was itself not dismissed.

      This Rule in no way bars the imposition of multiple penalties
      for the same act (or failure to act) if such action (or
      inaction) constitutes multiple Crimes, multiple Infractions, or
      any combination thereof.

[Rule 1505 is not changed.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1509 be amended to read:

      The Judge of a CFJ, the statement of which alleges that a Player
      has failed to perform a duty required of em by the Rules, shall
      issue an Order requiring that Player to perform that duty as
      soon as possible, if and only if the CFJ is judged TRUE.  

      If the duty in question arises because the Player in question
      holds a specific Office, the Order shall be issued to the
      Office.  If the Player holding that Office refuses to perform
      the duty in question as ordered, the Judge shall Order that that
      Player be removed from Office.

      If the duty in question arises for a reason not related to the
      Player in question holding a specific Office, and that Player
      refuses to perform the duty as ordered, the Judge shall amend
      the Order to require the Speaker to perform that duty instead.

      The refusal of the Speaker to perform a duty when ordered to do
      so by a Judge according to this Rule constitutes being an
      Impossible Speaker, as defined elsewhere.

      All Orders pursuant to this Rule are Judicial Orders, and are
      further subject to being amended to extend time or to being
      vacated, upon demonstration of good cause for failure to comply
      by the Player so ordered.

[More to come later; I still need to define Orders generally, Judicial
 Orders, Administrative Orders, and the procedures that will apply to
 amending, staying, and vacating Orders of various types.  This will
 probably require some pretty hefty changes, but will generalize the
 concept of Orders and probably actually simplify some of the Currency
 Rules somewhat.]

      also issue Orders sufficient to implement the penalty required
      by the Rules for that Infraction.  Such Orders are
      Administrative Orders.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1652 be amended to read:

      No Player shall be subject to penalties more than once for a
      single instance of a particular Crime or Infraction, any other
      Rule notwithstanding.

      Any CFJ whose Statement alleges that a Player has, through
      action or inaction, committed a Crime shall be dismissed if
      there is a prior CFJ, the statement of which alleges that the
      same Player has, through the same action or inaction, committed
      the same Crime, and which was itself not dismissed.

      This Rule in no way bars the imposition of multiple penalties
      for the same act (or failure to act) if such action (or
      inaction) constitutes multiple Crimes, multiple Infractions, or
      any combination thereof.

[Rule 1505 is not changed.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1509 be amended to read:

      The Judge of a CFJ, the statement of which alleges that a Player
      has failed to perform a duty required of em by the Rules, shall
      issue an Order requiring that Player to perform that duty as
      soon as possible, if and only if the CFJ is judged TRUE.      

      If the duty in question arises because the Player in question
      holds a specific Office, the Order shall be issued to the
      Office.  If the Player holding that Office fails to perform the
      duty in question as ordered, the Judge shall Order that that
      Player be removed from Office.

      If the duty in question arises for a reason not related to the
      Player in question holding a specific Office, and that Player
      fails to perform the duty as ordered, the Judge shall amend the
      Order to require the Speaker to perform that duty instead.

      The refusal of the Speaker to perform a duty when ordered to do
      so by a Judge according to this Rule constitutes being an
      Impossible Speaker, as defined elsewhere.

      All Orders pursuant to this Rule are Judicial Orders, and are
      further subject to being amended to extend time or to being
      vacated, upon demonstration of good cause for failure to comply
      by the Player so ordered.

      The failure of a Player to perform a duty required of em by
      virtue of being a Judge is not subject to review by the
      procedures established in this Rule.  Any CFJ alleging that a
      Judge has failed to perform a duty of a judicial nature shall be
      dismissed.

      A CFJ alleging that the Clerk of the Courts has failed to
      perform a duty of eir Office may, at the Caller's option, be
      filed with the Justiciar, who shall then perform all the duties
      of the Clerk of the Courts, with respect to that CFJ.

Be it therefore resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      An Order is a command, issued by one Player and requiring
      another Player, or an Office, to perform, or refrain from
      performing, some action.  An Order issued to an Office is
      binding on whatever Player holds that Office; if the Office
      changes hands before the Order is satisfied, the duty to abide
      by the Order attaches to the new Officeholder automatically.

      There are four classes of Order: Administrative, Judicial,
      Appellate, and Private.  A Judicial Order is an Order issued by
      a Player while acting as a Judge.  An Appellate Order is an
      Order issued by a Board of Appeals.  An Administrative Order is
      an Order issued by an Officer or other Player while acting in an
      official capacity (such as the Speaker or the Recordkeepor of a
      Currency).  A Private Order is any other sort of Order.  The
      class of an Order determines how Orders of that type are issued,
      amended, stayed, or vacated.

      Generally, any Order may be amended, stayed, or vacated by the
      Player who issued it; certain types of Orders may be amended,
      stayed, or vacated in other circumstances as well, when the
      Rules so specify.  Otherwise, an Order shall not be changed once
      issued.  In all cases, this is done by an Order to Amend, Stay,
      or Vacate, respectively, the original Order.

      The effect of amending an Order is to cause it to be changed to
      its amended form.  The prior form of the Order ceases to have
      effect upon the amendment, and the new form has effect as if it
      had been originally issued in that form at the moment the
      amendment becomes effective.  Vacating an Order to Amend has the
      same effect as would an Order to Amend which reinstates the
      previous form of the Order.

      The effect of staying an Order is to temporarily deny the stayed
      Order from having any effect.  A stay may be issued for a fixed
      time, in which case the stay expires at the time specified; or
      for an indefinite time, in which case the stay will not expire.
      If no specification is made in the Order to Stay, the stay shall
      be indefinite.  When the stay expires or is vacated, the
      previously stayed order again has effect as if it had been
      originally issued at the moment the stay ceases to be effective.

      The effect of vacating an Order is to permanently deny the
      vacated Order from having any effect.  Vacating an Order to
      Vacate reinstates the ability of the vacated Order to have
      effect, as of the moment the Order to Vacate is itself vacated.

      All Orders issued in the manner prescribed by the Rules for
      their class and type are presumed valid and enforceable until
      proven otherwise by CFJ.  However, in order to be proven valid
      by CFJ, the Rules must permit the Player who issued the Order in
      question to issue such an Order, that the issuance of the Order
      must have been required by or permitted in the circumstances
      which existed at the time it was issued, and that the Order has
      not been rendered invalid by the operation of any other Rule.
      Knowingly and willfully issuing invalid Orders constitutes the
      Class B Crime of Abuse of Authority.

      A Player who performs as required by an Order which is later
      found to be invalid is not liable for eir actions; but other
      Rules may establish procedures for correcting or remediating
      such circumstances when they occur.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:
      
      Judicial Orders are issued by being sent to the Clerk of the
      Courts, but do not take effect until their publication by the
      Clerk of the Courts.  The Clerk of the Courts shall publish each
      Judicial Order as soon as possible after receiving it from the
      Judge who issued it.

      Judicial Orders are subject to appeal to a Board of Appeal by a
      Call for Appeal.  The Board of Appeals shall, upon finding that
      a Judicial Order is improperly or invalidy issued, order that
      that Order be amended or vacated, as they deem appropriate.
      When the Clerk of the Courts receives a properly executed Call
      for Appeal of a Judicial Order, the Clerk of the Courts shall
      stay the Order under appeal.  If the Board of Appeals affirms
      the validity of the original Order, it shall then vacate this
      stay.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      Appellate Orders are issued by being sent to the Clerk of the
      Courts by the Lead Justice of a Board of Appeals, but do not
      take effect until their publication by the Clerk of the Courts.
      The Lead Justice shall certify in eir submission to the Clerk of
      the Courts that the Order is issued by the concurrence of the
      majority of the Justices comprising that Board of Appeals;
      failure to do so deprives the Order of effect.  The Clerk of the
      Courts shall publish each Appellate Order as soon as possible
      after receiving it from the Board of Appeal which issued it.

      Appellate Orders are not subject to appeal.  However, upon a
      judicial determination that the certification required by this
      Rule was falsely provided, the Justiciar shall vacate the Order
      which was accompanied by that false certification.

      The Lead Justice of a Board of Appeals is the Justiciar, if e is
      serving on that Board, or the Player who serves in the place of
      the Justiciar otherwise.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      Administrative Orders are issued by being published in the
      Public Forum, and take effect upon publication.  

      Private Orders are issued by submitting them directly to the
      Player to be commanded, and take effect upon submission, unless
      the Rules pertaining to that type of Order require that Orders
      of that type be published to take effect, in which case Orders
      of that type are issued by being published in the Public Forum,
      and take effect upon publication.

      Both Administrative and Private Orders are subject to appeal by
      a CFJ, the statement of which Statement alleges that the Order
      is improperly or invalidly issued.  The Judge of a CFJ, the
      statement of which alleges that an Administrative or Private
      Order was improperly or invalidly issued, shall vacate that
      Order if and only if the CFJ is judged TRUE.  When the Clerk of
      the Courts receives a properly executed Call for Judgement, the
      statement of which alleges that an Administrative Order was
      improperly or invalidly issued, the Clerk of the Courts shall
      stay the Order in dispute.  If the Judge affirms the validity of
      the original Order, e shall then vacate this stay.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1736 be repealed.  [Rule 1736 is
redundant; a Judge's Order to pay Currency is a Payment Order in its
own right.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1737 be repealed.  [Rule 1737 is
redundant; Payment Orders are Orders subject to appeal according to
the processes detailed above and can be vacated directly according to
those procedures.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1599 be amended to read:

      Whenever a Rule requires a Player to execute a Payment Order, e
      shall do so within seven days of when the requirement arises.

[Rule 1599 is almost wholly redundant; the failure to execute a
Payment Order falls within the scope of the amended Rule 1509.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1598 be amended to read:

      A Transfer Order is an Order requiring the Recordkeepor of a
      Currency to note the transfer of units of that Currency from one
      entity to another.  A valid Transfer Order specifies exactly one
      source entity, exactly one destination entity, exactly one
      Currency, and a number of units of that Currency which is a
      positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ.

      A Recordkeepor is required to abide by all valid Transfer Orders
      submitted by the Executor of the owner the units of Currency to
      be transferred, or by any other person empowered by the Rules to
      issue Transfer Orders on the behalf of the owner of the units of
      Currency, which do not result in an entity possessing a negative
      quantity of Currency.  Transfers shall be noted on the
      Recordkeepor's records in the order in which they are received
      by the Recordkeepor.

      If a Recordkeepor notes a transfer pursuant to a Transfer Order
      which is subsequently vacated, e shall correct eir records as
      soon as possible after the Transfer Order is vacated by noting a
      transfer which is the reverse of the transfer originally noted.
      However, if such a reversing transfer would result in an entity
      possessing a negative quantity of units of Currency, e shall
      instead issue a Payment Order requiring a Transfer Order that
      would have the same effect as the reversing transfer.

      The effect of noting a transfer on the records of the
      Recordkeepor is to remove the specified number of units of
      Currency from the holdings of the source entity and to add the
      specified number of units of Currency to the holdings of the
      destination entity.

      Each Recordkeepor shall maintain a record of all Transfer Orders
      submitted which specify the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor, for at least four weeks after their submission.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1746 be repealed.  [Rule 1746 is
redundant; a CFJ alleging that a Transfer Order is illegal would, if
found true, result in the vacation of that Transfer Order, which would
then trigger a reversing transfer or Payment Order under the revised
Rule 1598, above.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1730 be amended to read:

      The Recordkeepor of a Currency may, at eir discretion, elect to
      refuse any Transfer Order which requires em to note a transfer
      at any time other than as soon as possible after the Order
      itself became effective.  The Recordkeepor's election to refuse
      an Transfer Order in this fashion renders invalid that Order
      provided that the Recordkeepor sends a message to the Player who
      issued the Order informing him of eir election, within seven
      days of the receipt of that Order.

      This Rule does not apply to Transfer Orders which are required
      by the Rules to be issued with a specification that the transfer
      be noted at a time other than as soon as possible after they
      become effective.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1731 be repealed.  [Implicit
Transfer Orders are a pain, and exist only to support Voting.  The
conversion to paying for Votes after the fact eliminates the need for
this.]

I won't comment on that observation, but it seems to me that a
double standard for interpretation would also imply a double
standard for the application of penalties for violations.

You are labelling an action as dishonorable by virtue of being a
conscious violation of a Rule of which it remains to demonstrate that
it can be violated, or even 'bended'. An alternate interpretation
would be that my Votes simply had no legal effect. Your labelling
this move as a violation counts as a prejudgement, and your labelling
it as dishonorable is libelous. Or is that slanderous ?

I have to agree partially with Scott an partially with you on this one.
I agree with Scott that negative balances should not be regarded
as debt, and the Bank can't just unilaterally transfer
currency to someone just because e has a negative balance.
POs, not negative balances, are analogous to debt.

Still, I do believe that entities can have negative balances.  A
negative balance is a negative balance; nothing more, nothing less.

I think we need some general rules about what happens if a Judgement
is challenged and/or overturned, rather than handling it on a
case-by-case basis.

Why would suspension of Voting privileges require a sentencing order?
I would let the Assessor's report of suspension of voting privileges
stand; if the Assessor reported one illegally, it should be a
serious penalty on the Assessor, probably a class B crime.

Hello all,

     I've been observing your discussions and am in the process of
reading over the rules.  As this is likely to take awhile, I was
wondering if I might be able to post questions here as they occur to
me.
     One thing I'd like to know is which rule(s) are currently
infected with The Virus, if any.  And am I correct in assuming that
Infected Rules are still in effect if they have Power greater than 1?
     Thanks in advance,

-David Andreasen-

Welcome to the discussion!  Ask away with your questions.  Somebody may even
answer them.  8)  Hope you enjoy it enough to register soon.

I don't have a current list, myself, but I'm sure Chuck probably can let you
know which ones are infected.

Not exactly correct.  The Virus is incapable of infecting any Rules with a
power greater than one, so no such Rules can ever actually be infected.  Any
attempt by the Virus to do so is just plain ineffective.

No Rule currently has the Viral sentence (other than 1454 itself),
because I've been a bit behind in my duties.  But one probably
will within the next few minutes.

If the Rule number selected by the Virus has Power>1, than R1454
is unsuccessful in its attempt to amend the Rule. (Cf. R1322)

If you don't pay for voting, you go into VT debt (like overusing your
credit card). Of course, one penalty of VT debt should be not being
allowed to vote until "back in the black", if overvoting is allowed
(which, admittedly, partially defeats the purpose of seperating voting and
VT recordkeeping).
