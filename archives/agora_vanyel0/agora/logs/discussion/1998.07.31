Agorans have some history
at least of eschewing convenience for adherence to the law. The idea
that the general acceptance of a practice contrary to law is reason
enough to allow the instances of the practice to stand was certainly
rejected by the Judges of CFJ 737, for example, with the result that
several months of Kudo transfers were tossed out as invalid.
<<

I am quite aware of this, of course. My point was that the present
case was different, and not changing earlier practice was ok, because

- the wrong practice went on for a considerable time, more notably it
was followed by at least two different CotCs

- on one hand, no serious damage was done by the "wrong" assignments
(yes, some important CFJs might have had other outcomes if assigned
"correctly", but due to the strong random element in judge assignments
I don't think this is a strong point); on the other hand, declaring
all the CFJs concerned invalid and trying to "repair" the mistake by
reassigning all of them will be a mess of unprecedented extent (in
contrast to the Kudo example you quoted above - Kudos are an
essentially closed system with no formal interaction with other
aspects of the game).

- I still think that the situation was blatantly obvious. I must admit
that I'm not so sure about it anymore, given that many players claim
they never noticed this point before, but when I wanted to skip a CFJ
assignment for the first time, I briefly checked the rule and
immediately saw the situation as I still see it. 

And even if you didn't bother to look closely at the relevant rules
before, I claim that if you had, you'd seen my point quickly and
without much dispute (recent mails arguing otherwise, while perfectly
acceptable and honorable, seem to me to be first preparations to
challenge my judgement, i.e. motivated by a desired result, not by an
unprejudiced reading of the rules. Of course favoring a forced reading
of a rule over a more natural one is perfectly acceptable and has been
done before to avoid trouble. All I'm saying is that here there is a
more straightforward way to avoid trouble: revert to the natural
reading for the future and live with the fact that things weren't
formally correct i the past.)

This, I think, is different from various similar cases where the
"legal" reading of a rule was only established after real debate and
nontrivial judgements, and those who had overlooked the problem then
reread the relevant rule with a feeling of surprize about what turned
out to be the eventually accepted interpretation of the rule. In the
present case the only moment of surprize is that noone ever looked
closely at the rule, while its actual content seems uncontroversial to
me.

I think obligatory voting is too harsh. If people don't want to vote I
think this is a challenge to the political, and, if you like, the
economical aspects of gameplay and finetuning. But I don't think a
particular playing style (vote whenever you can afford it) should be
made obligatory in the rules.

I also like the possibility not to do much for some time without going
on hold. If you're not an officer with reporting duties, you can do
that at the moment.

I would support the more or less independent prolonging of the minimum
time on hold, though.

The idea is not bad, but I'm not sure I like the implementation. Why
not allow the Justitiar to pay out one indulgence per fortnight or so,
just as the speaker can pay out a Speaker's Gratuity? That would
essentially have the same effect, but be less formally involved.

Interesting.  Per R1859, this is ineffective but not a Crime.

I understand why you wrote it this way - the presence of excluded outcomes
implies that at least one non-excluded outcome got too high a probability -
but this breaks down when both types of error occur at once.  (For instance,
an initial selection assigns probabilities of 3/4, 1/4, and 0; it should
have assigned probabilities of 1/5, 1/5, and 3/5.)

Here's the simplest method I can think of:  If, for any two non-excluded
outcomes, the ratio of their initial probabilities is not what it should
have been, then redo the selection.  Otherwise, just deal with excluded
outcomes, if any.

Is it really necessary to develope such detailed rules for fixing
mistakes? Why not have a mild punishment for the officer who made the
mistake, and let the result stand? 

Yes, this allows some abuse, but that is something we wanted to allow
to officers, and punish politically (by electing someone else for
officer).

Well, as Steve pointed out, it can be made considerably less convoluted
by leaving out the Justiciar altogether, and just allowing the Player
to vacte eir own punishments without Objection.

What you suggest is also interesting, though I disagree that it has
"essentially the same effect".

There is a nomic game being played on Opal MOO (opal.moo.org 7777), using
the mailing lists there. I'm not sure how much it draws on or effects
the rest of the MOO.

LambdaMOO also has what might be described as the biggest online Nomic
ever. The wizards have turned over MOO-policy making to the general
public, via a nomic-like system of proposals and voting. They, however,
don't tend to regard it as a game (except for the more cynical inhabitants).

I also sent it to Steve directly, so I believe it is effective 
(unless Steve is not the Assessor, as the Registrar's report I 
checked indicated). Check the headers.

Upon closer inspection of the rules, it appears you are correct. I'll 
also send votes to Steve privately.

If I recall correctly, Antimatter sent his message to Steve with a CC
to the discussion forum.  I would interpret that as satisfying Rule
1859's requirement to send a message to the Assessor in order to
Vote.  And there is, as you note, no crime.

I disagree.  The Rule requires that the votes be sent to the Assessor,
but they do not preclude sending them to anyone else as well at the
same time.  (The language about allowing a self-copy is redundant with
our custom regarding Rule 116.)

I would interpret Rule 1859 so that any message containing votes which
is also sent to the Assessor shall be counted, even if it is sent to
other places at the same time.  Should one of those places also be a
Public Forum, the Voter thereby commits an Infraction, but that in no
way discounts eir Votes.
