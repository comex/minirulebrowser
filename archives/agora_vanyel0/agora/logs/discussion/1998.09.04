What I don't understand is how R1664 could have been left out of the
reform which introduced the concept of Electees, when it was precisely
the Threat's use of the Delegation/Revolt bug which was the inspiration
for that reform in the first place.

As I'm sure others will point out, this is a poor objection to Michael's
method. As long as the number he used really is random, and he doesn't
know the outcome in advance (so that he can't use this information to
bias his assignemnt of the outcomes), his method is fair. That's what I
take to be the lesson of CFJ 790. The real problem with Michael's method
is the difficulty of ascertaining with a high enough degree of
confidence that the number he used really is random - more precisely,
that taking the whole part of the DJIA mod 17 distributes the
probability evenly enough among the possible outcomes to satisfy R1079,
especially bearing in mind the high standards of proof of such thing set
by the Judgement of CFJ 790. Michael has now been challenged to prove
this, and R1079 places the burden of proof squarely upon him to do so.
I'll be interested to see what demonstration, if any, Michael can
provide.

All in all, I think he'd have been better off using the dice server,
which CFJ 832 has already established meets the requirements of R1079.

Ah - it's just occurred to me that Michael's method used the day's
closing price. It is therefore a random selection method that on any
particular day can only have *one* possible outcome, which is 
obviously biased. :)

I found some historical closing prices for the DJIA on the WWW
(between 1900 and 1993), and took the mod by 17.  The summary is as
follows:

0: 1357
1: 1401
2: 1491
3: 1392
4: 1397
5: 1459
6: 1401
7: 1556
8: 1494
9: 1511
10: 1646
11: 1588
12: 1631
13: 1778
14: 1763
15: 1456
16: 1450

If someone has the relevant statistical expertise, I'd appreciate
hearing about the result of a chi-square test on this data.  The data
is from 

http://econwpa.wustl.edu/eprints/data/papers/9603/9603001.abs

If the chi-square result is favourable, then I'd take this as
sufficient defence of my method as per R1079.  If not, then I will
redo the determination using some other interesting method.

Michael.

I can see now on the random CFJ how this might well be so., My CFJ on
that is based on the fact that i believe that Michael is in error in
believing that the stockmarket closing price is sufficiently random.  
I thought that the use of 17 instead of 16 is purely interpretation of
rules and not an error of any kind.  Enlighten me otherwise, i would
appreciate it.

Would you accept the closing price as random if the past 90 years of
data were shown to be uniformly distributed?

I agree incidentally that your second CFJ is an appropriate use of the
judicial mechanism.

Tell me, if the second CFJ is ruled true, but the first false, won't
the revolt succeed?

I have been looking at the numbers you posted.  If i read correctly,
you have plotted how many days in total did the number mod 17 give a
certain result?  Seems fair to agree to that on the surface, not that i
necessarily will. Just one question.  Don't we have to count the Friday
closes 3 times? A rebellion can occur on Friday Saturday and Sunday,
but the same number would be used for rebellions any of those days?

Maybe it was broken again when Risky Rebellion was introduced?

Nah, seriously - Michael defined his method as "I take the integral
portion closing DJ index modulo 17". Now, think for a moment - given
that we take Michael literally, if there had been *two* calls for
revolt, then the second one would inevitably have had the same
result, since the closing DJ didn't change - by definition. If there
had been, in fact, 20 calls for revolt, all 20 would have had the
same outcome according to a literal interpretation of Michael's
method. I call that biased. :) 

Of course, maybe Michael intended to use the closing value of the DJ
on different days for successive random determinations; but he
certainly didn't say so, but given the context and the comment in
the P.S. of his post I have a hunch Michael hadn't considered this
problem. If that is the case, I expect he will come right out and 
admit that the method was non-random, and reroll.

Oh yes, please note that successive Calls for Revolt are quite
legal, so it's not a purely hypothetical issue.

Au contraire, successive calls for revolt have to occur in different
weeks:

      A Player may Call for a Revolt at any time, by sending to the
      Public Forum saying e does so. A Call for Revolt is only
      effective if the following conditions are met:

         i) The player posting the Call is Rebellious,
        ii) No other effective Call for Revolt has been made that
            week,
       iii) A successful Revolt has not occured for a month or more.

An effective Call for Revolt is one that prompts a determination of a
Rebellion's success, not one that necessarily results in a successful
Rebellion. 

I have already said that I was only going to use this precise method
once.  On subsequent occasions I planned to use the close of day's
trading figure subsequent to the Call for Revolt.  This would stop
putative Robespierre's from timing their CfRs to suit the close of the
previous day's trading.  However, as Blob couldn't know what method I
was going to use when he made his CfR, this problem doesn't pertain.

Sadly, my proposed method for using the DJIA still isn't quite good
enough because of the possibility of CfRs occuring on Saturday and the
following Monday.  I guess I would just state that I was using the
next figure that hadn't been already used.  In any case, who cares?
We're concerned about what I did do, not what I proposed to do. 

Modulo (:-) worries that the DJIA % 17 may not give a uniform
distribution, I am confident that my method was fair. 

Michael.

Yes, but since the Friday closing value will prevail (under your
method) over a period of time which encompasses part of two different
Nomic Weeks, the consistent application of your method results in
complete predictability.  Specifically, should a revolt be called at
2359Z on Sunday, another could be called at 0001Z on Monday (two
minutes later) and thus be in different Nomic Weeks.  But the NYSE
will not again close until 2000Z that Monday (given a 4PM EDT close),
so the Friday close would still apply to the second Revolt.  Thus the
question is not moot.  (In any case, do we even have a doctrine of
mootness?)

I now concur with Morendil, and believe that the method used violates
the randomness requirements as previously established in case law.

The point you raise did occur to me.  In fact, in the post you quote
me from, I wrote:

- Sadly, my proposed method for using the DJIA still isn't quite good
- enough because of the possibility of CfRs occuring on Saturday and
- the following Monday.  I guess I would just state that I was using
- the next figure that hadn't been already used.  In any case, who
- cares?  We're concerned about what I did do, not what I proposed to
- do.

The method actually used is no different from using the most recent
roll made by a dice server that just happens to spit out random
numbers at the end of every week-day.  The first time I choose to use
this method it is safe to use the last number so emitted for two
reasons: 

1.  Blob doesn't know that I was going to use this method, so couldn't
    time his CfR to advantage; further

2.  I didn't know what the last number was before choosing to look at
    it.  

On subsequent uses, when people know what I'm doing, my protocol has
to be modified so that I wait for the next number to be emitted.  I
also make sure that I never use the same number twice (why people seem
to think I would make this mistake with the DJIA method and not with
rolling a dice on my desk baffles me).

Thus I maintain that the method *is* random. 

Michael.

Ah, you are correct. Then it *is* a theoretical issue. But an 
important one nevertheless; what if - due to ASAP scheduling
for instance - you had been required to make some other random
determinations on the same day ?

Further, Rule 1079's requirements deal with probability, not 
actuality. This is likely to mean that when choosing a random
selection method, what must be considered is the distribution
of actual outcomes over possible outcomes that *would* result
from applying the method a statistically significant number of
times; I contend that if the 'randomness' of a selection method
relies on that method only being able to yield an extremely reduced
set of samples, then it does not satisfy 1079.

Even if you do not grant the above, consider this - you have already
stated that you will no longer use that method. So we can take the
definition of that method to be, "On one unique instance, a random
selection over 17 player names will be made by taking the integral
portion of the Dow modulo 17". This means that the distribution of
actual outcomes over possible outcomes, *for that particular method*,
is 100% for one of the 17 numbers, and 0% for all other numbers. 
This is *very* far from the distribution expected from a 17-sided
die.

I do appreciate the fact that you were looking for a *verifiable*
randomness generator, though. It's an interesting puzzle; what is a
source of random numbers such that outcomes cannot be known in
advance but can be verified after selection, and that permits
selecting an unlimited (or practically unlimited) number of random
numbers ?

A good solution would be a random server that served numbers based
on the timestamp in the requesting message, and that permitted
querying what numbers were given for a particular timestamp. (It
would have to be based on the actual timestamp passed to it by the
nearest SMTP relay rather than the Date: header, which can be forged,
of course.) And it'd need plenty of disk space to log the requests
over a suitable period of time, say one week minimum.

Hmm, I know of one server that generates *truly* random bits (from 
an atom decay source) but I don't know if it logs them...

I'll forestall the obvious objection : "Then I would have chosen a 
different protocol, one that did not suffer from this limitation". Of
course, but that doesn't matter as far as the protocol that you *did* 
use is concerned.

I would have used a different method I guess.  If I don't know what
the result is before applying a determination method, but I'm
confident that the values possible are uniformly distributed, then
this is adequate.  This is the import of the CFJ that Steve quoted a
while back; the problem wasn't that KoJen used a cereal box
(equivalent to me looking at a past value of the DJIA), just that he
couldn't be sure that his selection was from a suitably random source.
 
You followed up to your own post:

The protocol I used was random.  If it happens to not produce numbers
fast enough, I don't have to use it all the time.  I could interleave
it with dice, my machine's /dev/random and all manner of other
things.

I think that it might be useful to consider not just the declared
protocol, but in fact the _meta_-protocol, namely how the concrete
protocol in each case is chosen.

For example, imagine that I have no idea what Michael's phone number is
(which happens to be the case.)  Then I might choose to look it up and
use, for a particular random selection among 10 cases, the last digit of
that phone number.

If we look at it from a meta-perspective, this choice is random, as long
as no one who knew Michael's phone number could guess in advance that I
would use that method (I guess I just blew it ;-).  Because the
meta-method of choosing concrete unknown numbers from various sources and
then looking them up would indeed, I believe, give a uniform distribution.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

I still realize my arguments were ill phrased at best, but do most of
you, in light of the discussion that has ensued, agree with Blob that I
should have made a COE on the random determination method rather than
called a CFJ?

In general, if you think an Officer has made a mistake of some kind (even
regarding Rule interpretations), it's best to COE first, IMO.  You can get
quicker results this way if the Officer agrees with your assessment.  You can
always CFJ if e doesn't, so you don't lose anything by COEing first.

In this particular case, it appears you would have ended up with a CFJ anyway,
but I would say Blob's advice is sound.  8)

I note that the original decision in CFJ 790 (recently reposted) seems
to have wrestled with this question.  My gloss on that Judgement is
that any system of selection which relies on a random selection of
method to compensate for any bias in the methods selected from is not
"random" for the purpose of the Rules.  I therefore believe that
Michael cannot save his method by showing that he chose it "randomly".

Nope, you misunderstand the chi-square test.  If the result
is favorable, it only says that the data do not prove that the
selection is non-random (to a certain confidence level).  It does
*not* say that the data prove that the method is random.

For example, flip a coin once.  Suppose you get heads.  
Now, if you do a chi-square test on the distribution
1 heads, 0 tails, as compared to the theoretical average
of 0.5 heads, 0.5 tails, the test will turn out favorable.
Which means that the data do not disprove the randomness of
the coin.  The data do not prove the randomness of the coin,
either.

While R1079 requires that random choices be made with equal probability
for all outcomes, it does not require that multiple random selections
be independent of each other.

Thus, if I were required to make a random selection between A and
B, and another between C and D (and the timing was such that I could
make the selections at the same time), it would be legal for me to say,
"I will flip a coin once; if heads, the results will be A and C; if
tails, B and D."

I won't buy this. I find it very hard to believe that there is no 
correlation between today's DJIA and tomorrow's. Knowing todays value
means that tomorrow's value is no longer a uniform random variable.

It's also being a bit more polite to the Officer in question, I think.
When you think they are wrong, you approach them about it first, before 
going to a higher authority.

Good answer Chuck!  In fact many things that we assumed had random
distributions, in fact did not.  If you plot them in a way such that a
random distribution would eventually result in a uniform grey, strange
patterns show up. Even random numbers plugged into fairly simple
formulas can generate patterns that are not immediately obvious by
looking at the formula.
