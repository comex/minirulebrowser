There are occasions when we might not want that to be the case. I
don't believe this is necessary, though; a more general mechanism
could be desirable, such as allowing the Speaker to issue
'presumptively valid' Orders to Amend (or a suitably restricted
class thereof).

To be complete, make that

       [...] the Judge shall consider game custom,
       commonsense, past Judgements, past Judicial Orders issued
       in similar circumstances, and the best interests of the
       game before applying other standards.

Shouldn't this specify a number of Players required to initiate the 
Appeal, in which case you could have it as "upon the insistence
of three arbitrary Players, or the Player (or one of the Players) 
such an Order is directed at", in line with Criminal Judgements.

Do we have a definition of 'standing' by now ? If not, maybe you
can take this occasion to dispose of this clause.

I fail to see the reason for this.

You should get the "agreement between that Player and the entity to 
which the Order is directed" language in there as well. I also think
the notion of "legal control" could do with a clarification; you 
could mention Executors, Executors in Probate and Power of Attorney.

This still contains the same flaws I pointed out in the first
Veto Scam Proposal--First, that "Proposals are explicitly exempt
from this provision" is vague--Proposals are exempt as the creating
instrument, or the created instrument, or both?  Second, and mor
importantly, setting the Power of a Proposal equal to its
Adoption Index is dangerous, as I attempted to demonstrate with
my Counterscam the Veto Scam.  The Power of a Proposal should not be
set until the time at which it takes effect.

There was a correction. 'More Fun with Priority' was eventually distributed
about 2 days later.

Both, since the 2nd paragraph specifies the Power a Proposal may have,
and the power of instruments it will create.

But, if the Voting Index doesn't exceed the Adoption Index, which is
impossible until the end of the voting period, the proposal can't take
effect whatever its Power. You can't side-step this by directly setting
a Proposal's Voting Index, because it still has to be Adopted before it
takes effect.

I agree with Oerjan. I consider breaking the rules and committing Crimes
as quite distinct things. It's an "in-game" vs. "meta-game" distinction.
A player who commits a Crime should be punished, and should expect to face 
recriminations in-game (in a role-playing sense), but may well be 
regarded by me as a clever game-player at the meta-game level. 

However a player who flagrantly disobeys the rules should expect
recriminations at the meta-game level, because they are violating the
meta-game agreement to abide by the rules of the game.

Note that this does not mean that Crimes can be committed lightly.

An example to make the point would be nice. Perhaps R1792 contains one:

      There is a type of Application known as an Proposal Application.
      Such an Application is executed by submitting it to the
      Promotor.  This application takes effect when executed.  For a
      Proposal Application to take effect it must;

      iii) Specify the non-player entity which the Rules shall deem to
           have submitted the included Proposal.  This entity cannot
           be an entity defined elsewhere in the Rules as a Proposing
           Entity.

The other appearances of 'cannot' in the Ruleset appear to be
legitimate instances of impossibility, so the claim that the word
is "frequently" misused doesn't really stand up to scrutiny.
