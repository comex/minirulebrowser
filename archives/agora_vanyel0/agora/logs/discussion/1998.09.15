What was this all about again?

They are identical. Get rid of the conditional and just delete the last

I'll show you my reasons if you'll show me yours...

Actually, I'll explain my reasons anyway: I want to discourage Players
from saving VTs for non-existent rainy days, and use them now. If
Players know they can't hang on to more than about 5 VTs at a time, they
might be tempted to vote more. As Chuck has pointed out, this policy is
tougher on Officers than on the unemployed.

What reasons are there for raising the VTCL?

You were probably going to get to this, but I'll remind you anyway:

Outstanding, aaa315 and aaa324, both for 0.4 VTs.

Er, please forget I sent that. I meant to hit "forget it" after I
realized that Michale had paid those two POs in his Bank Transactions
message, but hit "send" accidentally.

I assume you realise that you're quoting from an old report, and that
you are actually holding the office temporarily now because of the
Revolt.  Anyway, the date on the left is the time when you became
Electee.  You have read it correctly as 30 August 1998.  The date on
the right (1 December 1998) is when your term of office was due to
expire.  I will use three-letter month abbreviations rather than
numbers in that position from now on though, given how it seems to be
an issue of concern. 

Michael.

Hm. I thought you'd done them already. But perhaps the 2 transfers in
your previous message were Distributor payments, not Comissions.

Well, I will change the 01/12/98 to 01 Dec 1998, as per my previous
message.  Lee didn't have any problems parsing the other date, and I
think it's suitably unambiguous.  I agree it's a bit difficult to
read, but I only have so many columns. 

Michael.

They were Distributor payments.  I was just satisfying all of the
orders in my two most recent "official salaries" messages
straightaway.

I like mazes.

I have at times thought that we need an anti-American party.  Its purpose
would be to purge Agora of influence from the (boring) US law and
constitution style.

Granted, with a majority of Players from the USA I have been somewhat
reluctant to suggest this...

I thought it was illogical to have "if" after its corresponding number and
"otherwise" before.  When I suggested moving "otherwise" after the "(ii)",
you protested.

No.  I try to write my Proposals so that they won't wreak havoc if another
Proposal should amend the same Rule first.

I seem to have deleted the discussion.  Possibly it was something to do
with using Without Objection instead, to prevent Pardon being used for
personal gain.

Laurent> Why ?

Because such a system avoids many of the problems we've had with the
effect of Proposals.  Right now, for example, Proposals have no power
to directly command anything, so we use the rather kludgy mechanism of
self-repealing Rules instead (something else I believe should be
abolished).  Instead, I would allow an adopted Proposal (or "statute")
to have the full force of law, and have the Ruleset contain (solely
for reference) all statutes of a general and permanent nature,
excluding those of a temporary or nongeneral nature such as one-time
payments, commands issued to single Players, and other such matters.
The determination of which statutes go into the published rules will
lie with the Rulekeepor, but eir decision to include a statute in, or
exclude a statute from, the rules in no way grants or deprives that
statute of legal effect.

You may have done it already and I haven't got down to it in my backlog of

I remember liking this idea when you first proposed it; I'd certainly
support it now.

I quite agree with Oerjan on this.  I really like mazes.  I do like the
Spring cleaning, but that doesn't make it less twisty, only more self
consistent.  BTW will spring cleaning fix gamestate and  Game State
inconsistency?

On the other hand, I think we've worked our current system for all

I'm amazed at this line of thought.  I believe this will result in less
votes.  The small number of VTs has raised the value of VTs to the point
were they are worth too much to spend on the average proposal.  It is my
opinion that a increase in the number of VTs will reduce the tendency to
hold on to them and we will have more voting.

I will also point out that my reluctance to vote comes from the fact that I
earn a mere .2 VTs a week.  At 1 VT/vote it costs me 5 weeks of saving to
afford to vote.  If I'm going to spend that 5 weeks the proposal will have
to be a damn good one.

'19980830172837' is 14 characters.
'30 Aug 98 17:28' is 15 characters, much more readable and loses only
irrelevant information about seconds. Get rid of the year information,
which could be taken to be implicit, and it would be only 12 characters.

I must dissent from the reasoning offerred by Kolja and state that I
believe this CFJ should be Judged FALSE. Kolja is mistaken when he
asserts that R1817 does not state when the condition is to be checked.
The last sentence of R1817 places an important constraint on when the
condition is to be checked:

      Transfers shall be noted on the Recordkeepor's records in the
      order in which they are received by the Recordkeepor.

Consider the situation in which Jack has 1 VT, and attempts to transfer
2 VTs to the Bank. A day later, 2 VTs are transferred to him from the
Bank. If Kolja were correct, the Accountor would now be required to note
Jack's attempted transfer to the Bank out of order, after the Bank's
transfer to him. This would violate the provision quoted above from
R1817.

OK, but at 0.2 VTs/week, the unemployed are always going to be reluctant
to vote. The level of the VTCL is going to be basically irrelevant to
that consideration. What concerns me is that Officers, who can afford to
vote, choose to save their VTs instead. 

Now, say the VTCL were lowered to 5. Of course, taxes would have to be
levied immediately, but after that, what then? Officers will be in the
position of knowing that if they don't spend their VTs, they will simply
lose them to taxation. It would seem to me rational in that case to
spend the VT on a vote. In other words, lowering the VTCL decreases the
value of VT holdings above a certain level, or beyond a certain time, in
response to your concern, raised above, that the value of VTs has become
too great to make it worth spending them on the average Proposal. This
has become true because a VT now keeps its worth for a long period into
the future. Lowering the VTCL means that a VT now is worth much more
than a VT in the future, because you are unlikely to be able keep VTs in
the future that you don't spend now.

Of course, I might be wrong. The reluctance to spend VTs may be due to
apathy and not to the high value of VTs. But in that case, even
reverting to a system of completely free voting won't increase voting.
