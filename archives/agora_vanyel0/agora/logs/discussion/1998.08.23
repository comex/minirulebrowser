BUS: COE: Macross Innocent of Public Voting

Actually, I don't think this follows from my judgement.  Even though a message
sent to the PF cannot be used to *cast* a vote, it does not settle the question
of whether a message to the PF can *contain* a vote.  IMO, this will require a
separate CFJ.  It is possible then that the penalty for Public Voting is still
effective, even though the vote was not cast.

I request that all PO issued in this matter be vacated.  Further, I request
that any and all PO's issued due to the non-payment of this non-debt be
likewise vacated.

Thanks.

[regarding the general case of Rule X wishing to defer to Rule Y]

Only in the following cases:
1) Rule X has higher Power than Rule Y.
2) Rule Y also attempts to defer to Rule X, but has a higher Rule number
   than Rule X.

Either they both defer, or neither one defers.  Either way, there is
clearly a conflict, which is resolved by Power-then-Rule-number.

Absolutely true.  However, I was fast approaching the time limit to make the
Claim of Error and so I made it.  If Steve decides to deny the claim then I
will make a more specific CFJ.
