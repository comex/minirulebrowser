I note that the Rules do not define precedence relations for Proposals,
and do not speak of conflicts except among Rules. If it were held that
a Proposal can conflict with the Rules, then the Rules would be silent
as to how that conflict is resolved. My position does not suffer from
this drawback. In my view, the action of a Proposal can only be brought
into conflict with a Rule insofar as some Rule tries to give the Proposal
effect. It is this Rule (usually 594 or 1322, I guess) which then
participates in the conflict (with, eg. R1698).

These Transfers were all for the wrong amounts; R1684 mandates a VT
supply of 2/3 the number of Proposals in a given week, or 8 VTs,
whichever is less. Clearly, 8 is less.

What's the procedure now? Do I make a COE? Presumably, the TOs have
been executed and there's nothing than can now be done about that.
How do I get a correction made?

No, they do not.  Rule 1047/8:

      When an Interested Proposal Proposed by some Player is adopted
      with no votes cast AGAINST it, that Player is awarded the Patent
      Title of Zeitgeist.  All current holders of the Title of
      Zeitgeist lose the Title whenever it is newly awarded.  The
      Assessor is responsible for detecting and reporting the awarding
      of this Patent Title.

Note the word "Interested" in the first line.

Damn.  I missed that.  Yes, you make a COE.  Everyone will have to pay
back their 9 VTs, though.
