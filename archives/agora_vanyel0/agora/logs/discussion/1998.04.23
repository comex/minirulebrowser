You can't de-Kudo yourself (or any Player) twice in the same week.  See

H. Assessor Steve,

P3730, being an urgent proposal, ran out of voting period on Saturday,
so I was wondering what the result for it is.

Bad news.  This PO had been vacated by the Tabula Rasa proposal passage.  The
same proposal also repealed the Inadverdent Transfer Rule, so this VT just went
to the Bank with no legal possibility of getting it back.  Sorry.

Untrue.  All he has to do is vacate that transfer order (unless you
guys did something to break that functionality).

I thought the reason IT was repealed was because you could simply vacate
the TOs...
