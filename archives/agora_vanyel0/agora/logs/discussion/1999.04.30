See 
   http://www.greenapple.com/~words1/back-b2.html
for one of many exegeses available on the Web, or try the search 
'curate egg' in your favorite search engine. I haven't so far been 
able to locate a reproduction of the original cartoon, which is a 
pity, but I'll keep looking.

Was the failure of P3854 was due to the rule repealing it self before 
the proposal passed, or was there a mistake in how it was written?

Hmm..
Rule 1786/0 (Power=1)
Proposal Passed by the Narrowest of Margins
...

      2) If there had been 1 (one) less FOR vote (out of the total
         number of FOR votes in the final tally) on this proposal,
         it would not have passed or not met Quorum -- or both.
...

If there had been one less vote FOR, then it would not of met Quorum (I 
think). And so I still think that it should be determined to
have passed by the narrowest of margins.

The answer is in the line above yours. A Separation of Powers had already
amended 1873 to remove the line that you tried to remove.

Nevermind, at least you get your P-Notes, (and yes, your VTs too - although
I would have renegotiated our deal if I realised you'd do so well out 
of a null proposal.)

Sure, but this is no more surprising than the fact that articles in
journals are separated into sections, paragraphs, and sentences, which
can independently convey quite different meanings. 

Anyway, Morendil has again beaten me to a good analysis of this
question.

      A Proposal is created whenever a Proposing Entity delivers some
      collection of text to the Public Forum with clear wording that

What's wrong with this substitution?  Did you mean that you couldn't
make it without altering the meaning?

I disagree with your opinion. 6d is clear as in 'the road is clear' - it does
not apply to texts. Rather, the 'clear indication' in the rule in my opinion
clearly (getting circular here...) denotes meaning 3c - unambiguous,
easily understood, and clearly NOT anything of meanings 1, 2, 4, 5 or 6.

It would be difficult to demonize drugs as severely as Americans do,
just as it would be difficult to worship guns as fetishistically as they
do. (I say this having watched with a mixture of fatalism and disbelief
the American reaction - particularly the Republican party reaction - to
the Columbine High School massacre.)

Cocaine is not much used here - it's extremely expensive, up to $200 a
gram. Heroin is regarded as the big drug problem at the moment.

Nevertheless, enlightened and well-informed leadership on drug issues is
as difficult to come by in Australia as it is in the US. Our current
Governent is the most socially conservative government this country has
suffered since the 1950s, from whence much of its social policy seems to
originate.

Your other criticisms are sound, but I'm not sure about this one. R594
says:

      The Adoption Index of a Proposal is the maximum of 1, the value
      requested by its Proposer (if any), and the value required for
      that Proposal by the Rules (if any).

It doesn't say that the request has to accompany the making the of the
Proposal. As far as I can tell, harvel could request that "Patch Rule
107" have AI=3 now, and such a request would be effective.

In fact this may be a reasonably serious bug - I see nothing which
prevents a Proposer from making such a request after a Proposal has
been adopted.

Chuck, I think this is a most inconsiderate way of proceeding. These
charges are serious and I would like to be given a chance to defend
myself. By forcing me to confront 5 CFJs at once, you have made that
much more difficult. I resigned as CotC so that justice might be seen to
be done. You have made that less likely by your actions.

Well, gee, Macross, I can't remember when I last saw a Proposal which
was "bright, luminous, cloudless". Perhaps no Proposal has ever been
delivered to the PF with a clear indication that it is intended to
become a Proposal?

Oh, you meant "clear in all reasonable *and relevant* senses of the
word".

Now tell me, which are the relevant senses of the word? I think that's
what Crito is trying to decide.

I remind the Judges of CFJs 1126-1130 that R1575 applies:

      A CFJ alleging that a Player has violated a Rule or committed a
      Crime shall not be judged TRUE unless the evidence is sufficient
      to be certain of that Judgement beyond reasonable doubt.

Yes, that is what I meant.  Sorry if I was unclear.  I feel that the current
rule doesn't require that the indication be in words.  It may take any form
so long as it is clear.  We normally use words simply because they tend to
be the best way of ensuring clarity though they are not the only way.
