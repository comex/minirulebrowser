Only 1/2? I'm a little perplexed that you're taking this so
personally, Chuck. Every Officer is in a similar position.
I know I don't feel that the passage of P3760 is a slap in
the face from other Agorans, or represents any sign that my
contribution to the game is not sufficiently valued.

A word about my vote on P3760. Since I agree with you that
the Proposal creates problems, my vote FOR the Proposal may
seem puzzling. First of all, I cast my vote before your post
pointing out the problems with the Proposal. Since voting is
now indelible, the most I could have done was to cast a second
vote AGAINST to neutralize my first vote. But it didn't seem
likely to me that this would make much of a difference, and
indeed it would not have done, given the comfortable passage
of the Proposal. But secondly, the passage of the Proposal
doesn't actually worry me that much. The problems it creates
are largely political problems, and these kinds of problems
interest me. So although from a role-playing point of view,
the injustice (or potential injustice once Plots can be purchased)
concerns me, from a metagaming point of view, I'm curious to
see what political forces this injustice might unleash, whether
a Cartographor with control of Plot-productivity will be able
to find a politically satisfactory level for that productivity,
and so on.

Quite true, and at least one other Officer has posted agreement
with me.

No?  It seems to me that Agorans are saying "We appreciate
your contribution to the game, but not enough to make
it economically worthwhile."  (By "your" I mean not just
me, but all Officers.)

Of course, it may be that those supporting P3760 did not
mean for holding an Office to be economically punitive, but
rather felt that the BOS should be higher.  If Plots were
changed to be workable, while not changing their basic
operation as currently outlined in the Rules, my first action
would be to lobby the Chancellor to increase the BOS--not just
to a level where being Rulekeepor is worthwhile, but to
the point where even holding a 1-BOS Office is worthwhile.

I think you're mistaken to assume that the supporters of P3760 must
have desired it to be the case either that holding an Office be
economically punitive or that the BOS be higher. It is apparent to me
that the supporters of P3760 are interested in exploring the idea of
a kind of landed aristocracy in opposition to an Officer class. Of
course, this may not be a good idea. It is equally apparent that they
did not think through the consequences of this very deeply before
voting - I include myself among this number. And although the
immediate effects of P3760 may well be to present us with a choice
between penalizing Officers and raising the BOS, the supporters of
P3760 may well have had in mind, as I did, the third option of taking
further measures to correct the situation, once P3760 was adopted.

That's fine, as long as the "further measures" don't take too long.
One option you might consider is abolishing Farms altogether, so that
the "landed aristocracy" do not have direct access to VTs through
their structures.

As one of the supporters of 3760, I'd like to make my motivation known.
Personally, I think this whole Plots thing has been implemented 
prematurely, and I would prefer to have delayed it until we had proper
levers of control implemented, so that we could tune the economy. 
Nevermind, it seems that Plots are broken anyway, so we have a bit 
more time to fix things before any real effect is felt.

Once the Cartographor is given power to control the levels of 
production available from Plots, I would lobby em to set things so
that Plot production could only rival Officer Salaries if players
put significant effort into trading. The subsistance level arrangement
(2 Mines & 1 Farm) should not imho produce much more than the 
unemployment benefit.

If the power to set these things lies in the hands of the Cartographor 
- an Officer - then e has an interesting dilemma. It is in eir 
personal interest to set the Plot production rates low, relative to the
BOS, but that might cause a significant swing against em in the 
Elections. This is something I would love to see played out.

So, Chuck, I never intended for this to demean your role as an Officer.
I do want to see rivalry between Officers and Landholders established,
but I think it should take a brilliantly succesful trader to match
the income of a 2 BOS Officer.

Your argument is reasonable, but I'm not wholly convinced. Seeing that

disgareement to warrant a CFJ.
