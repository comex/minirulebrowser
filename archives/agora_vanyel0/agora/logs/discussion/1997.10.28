Oh?  And exactly what requirement am I imposing, and which non-Players
am I imposing it on?  Think carefully before answering.

Not true.  I don't care one way or the other.  Maybe it is a good
Proposal -- I don't deny that it's an improvement on the current Rule,
and under other circumstances I might well have supported it -- but it
should have been better.  It would have been better if there had been
more negotiation over the protos.  My intention in advocating abstention
was merely to stop people wasting votes, when they could save them for
a properly considered final version next week.

On the other hand, if you're still of the opinion that Proposing it
in this form wasn't a mistake, I suppose that means you won't want to
consider further protos, in which case I'd be wasting my time posting
them.

>Why the paranoia, Zefram?

It's not paranoia when they're out to get you.

Dear zefram,

thank you for your remarks.

>>
The original purpose of Disinterested Proposals was that the Proposer
gains no benefit from the outcome of the voting, to avoid people
voting AGAINST Proposals merely to avoid the Proposer receiving these
benefits.  Translating "Interested Proposal" to "Proposal" will
reintroduce such influences, making Disinterested Proposals necessary
again.
<<

I'm afraid I don't quite understand this point. After the changes I
protoed there will be no benefits involved with getting proposals
through, so I don't quite see what influences you refer to when you
say that the interested-disinterested distinction is still
necessary. Could you try explaining that again?

>>
>1729: replace the string "An Interested Proposal is Insane," by "Any
>Proposal submitted is Insane,"
>
>[Anyone have a better change?

Repeal it.
<<

But that is a change not connected with P-notes. If you don't like
insane proposals, you may propose repealing this rule - but in a
P-note abolition I'd rather not include other changes that might
provoke opposition from people who would otherwise support abandoning
P-notes.

Well, it's always comforting when my messages only take a week
to get delivered. :(  There's the missing SLR, too, I see.
