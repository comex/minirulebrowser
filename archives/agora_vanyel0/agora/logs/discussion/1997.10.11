Assuming I am not too late, I hereby dismiss these CFJs, since
they do not admit to being true or false.

A few observations, pending more detailed discussion and possible
follow-up action :

* if the Injunctions submitted in the relevant Judgement were not 
   legal, they were not Injunctions; thus no penalty can meaningfully 
   be applied as Steve or elJefe argue.
* should 'appropriateness' be the sole criterion for the overturning 
   of these Injunctions, the penalty for Wrongful Injunction applies,
   but Double Jeopardy limits this to a maximum of 4 Infractions as
   far as I can see.
* it seems to me that Justice Andre's decision is vacuuous, insofar 
   as it calls for the Judgement to be set aside rather than the 
   Injunctions
* more importantly, Rule 1695 requires the Justices to determine 
   whether the Injunctions are 'appropriate' to 'the situation'. The 
   Justices have taken it upon themselves to decide that 'the 
   situation' means 'the context of the CFJ'; I grant that this might 
   be one reasonable interpretation, but there may exist others 
   equally reasonable, such as taking 'the situation' to mean 'the 
   current state of the game as a whole'; and in this instance I do 
   not believe that the mandate of this Board of Appeals included 
   making such a determination, especially insofar as no precedent
   exists. At the very least a discussion is called for.

Before we begin, I appreciate that the issues are, or may seem, very
serious to you. If the charges stick, you will be deregistered for
Lawlessness. So of course I expect you to argue very hard, and explore
every conceivable avenue of escape. I hope that you will do so with
same jocular and jaunty esprit that you have so far displayed in many
arguments over the last few months, even though that will doubtless be
more difficult in a case like this one, in which the outcome will have
significant personal consequences. As a tonic, then, allow me to remind
you that it *is* just a game, and that even should you be deregistered
for Lawlessness, this will not be the end of the world, but merely a
month in the sin bin, so to speak, during which your participation will
scarcely be lessened by your inability to vote or Judge or run for
Office. You'll still be able to make CFJs, and most importantly, you'll
still be able to put your side of any argument that interests you in
that inimitable style I've come to enjoy so much. And a month is no
time at all.

With that said, let's go to the arguments:

>* if the Injunctions submitted in the relevant Judgement were not

>   be applied as Steve or elJefe argue.

To argue this, you will have to show that it is in fact impossible
to make an illegal Injunction. Game custom does not support this.
There are a number of Formal Apologies written by Judges convicted
of making illegla Injunctions. Statements from duly authorized Judges
claiming to be Injunctions are accepted prima facie as Injunctions,
although they may be later determined, as in this case, to have been
illegally made and therefore to have no effect.

R1652 says you can't be penalized more than once for each illegal act.
What Jeff and I were doing in our Judgements was counting, in slightly
different ways, how many illegal acts we thought you committed. I think
you made 30 illegal Injunctions: this is 30 acts, and therefore 30
penalties. R1652 cannot save you, I think.

>* it seems to me that Justice Andre's decision is vacuuous, insofar 
>   as it calls for the Judgement to be set aside rather than the

This should certainly be looked into, but it can't help you, since
the other Justices are in substantial agreement about how the case
is to be handled.

The Board of Appeals certainly had a mandate to reach the decision
it did. It is true that the Rules and game custom are silent about
what 'appropriate for the situation' in R1695 means; however,
commonsense, and especially the best interests of the game, are not.
I don't think I need argue that our interpretation is a
commonsensical one, and you seem to concede as much above when you
agree that it is one reasonable interpretation. What you seem to be
suggesting above is that, given the state of the game as whole, in
particular the destruction of VTs and Indulgences, and the many
Infractions of Persistent Indebtedness that have been committed as
a result, that your Injunctions might have been seen as appropriate
remedies.

However, the suggestion will not stand up to even the most cursory
examination. In the first place, they were carelessly worded: because
they referred only to current Officers, they would not have supplied
Indulgences for the relief of the PI Blots incurred, for instance, by
any Player who had failed to satisfy a VT Payment Order issued by me
while I was Registrar.  But in the second place, and much more
importantly, even had the Injunction been properly worded to achieve
the desired effects, it would still not have been appropriate, in my
opinion, to achieve them in this way. The whole thing smacks of a
kind of vigilante justice, notwithstanding its delivery from the
hands of a Judge. The best way to deal with the problems created by
the adoption of P3533 is the way we are currently pursuing; the
Chancellor has now minted some VTs so Salaries and other things can
be paid, and legislative remedies are being framed which will go
through the normal channels of the Proposal system.

Be it therefore resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      A Holiday is a period of time, not to exceed 7 days in length,
      designated as such by the Rules.  If one Holiday begins
      within 24 hours of the end of another Holiday, the two Holidays
      and the time between them are taken as a single Holiday, unless
      this would cause the combined Holiday to exceed 7 days in
      length, in which case the first Holiday is extended to 7 days
      and the second Holiday does not occur.

      During a Holiday, no Proposal may be distributed by the
      Promotor, nor may any Call for Judgement, Judgement, notice of
      Appeal, Decision of Appeals Boards, or Opinion be published by
      the Clerk of the Courts; however, if any of the above do take
      place during the Holiday in violation of this Rule, this Rule
      does not deprive them of their usual effects.  

      If some Rule requires that an action be done prior to a
      given time, and that given time falls during a Holiday, or
      within the twenty-four-hour period immediately following that
      Holiday, then that action need not be done until twenty-four
      hours after that Holiday ends.  If some Rule bases the time of a
      future event upon the time of another event, or requires that a
      Player perform some action within some time of another event,
      and that event occurs during a Holiday, the time at which the
      Holiday ends shall be used instead for the purpose of
      determining the time of the future event or of the time by which
      the Player must perform the specified action.  

      This Rule takes precedence over all Rules pertaining to the
      timing of events, and over all Rules which require Players to
      perform events before a specified time.

I think you have the wrong one here. The Subject line of this one says
1050 too. There is one wrong, but it is this one:


======================================================================

                               CFJ 1051

		"Elde is Blob's Executor in Probate."

This '1051' should read '1053'.

Oh, naturally - it's not really as though this is such a big issue.
I mean, a 60-Blot penalty would be something to be proud of, in the
spirit of past Scamsters who brilliantly chose to defy loose Rules, 
such as Chromatic Repeals or Crito's Wins.

In much the same way that it's impossible to make illegal POs. By 
which I mean, the arguments put forth in the Justices' decision seem 
to argue both that the Injunctions were not really Injunctions, and 
that I should get fined for them.

This does not seem consonant with some other decisions that I recall, 
but the issue deserves to be addressed - which I'll do, in much 
detail, in a future post.

Unless it's also brought before the Courts how many Injunctions were 
submitted exactly. As you are aware, the issue is contentious. I'll 
definitely think of CFJing on that issue.

Hmm, it is important - if Andre is out of the picture, then any
issues on which you and elJefe don't agree do not a majority make.

> The Board of Appeals certainly had a mandate to reach the decision

So you assert. So I dispute. The Board reached a decision concerning
what 'appropriate' means in the context of 1695, where it should
have only be concerned with determining whether the Injunctions were
in fact appropriate. That it couldn't do one without also doing the
other need not concern us; I am only arguing that the Board
overstepped its mandate.

Also the matter of 'deference to the original Judge' that you
yourself made so much of a short while ago deserves to be brought up
in this context. Your interpretation of 'appropriate', and elJefe's,
were offered as obvious, but you did take the opportunity of this
Appeal to make new law, where no compelling reason existed to do so,
as no precedent existed to justify the decision that the Injunctions 
were not appropriate.

What is needed for this to be a defense of your decision is not to
show that my actions were not as appropriate as some other actions,
but that the Injunctions were not appropriate, period. As long as
they achieved part of the above they would have been somewhat
appropriate, which would be enough.

That you yourself came up with this suggestion - I certainly don't
recall mentioning it - seems to indicate that it's not so
unreasonable. :)

Oh, that reminds me - I have a proto that implements this very idea

Very interesting. I have been mulling over the exact same idea.
Go for it. Any particular Holidays in mind?

Nothing in particular, although it would make sense to make Agora's
Birthday a Holiday.  Also, the idea of allowing the Speaker to declare
a Holiday (perhaps Without Objection) may be meritorious.

Herald Crito will have no choice but to correctly allege that you are
Lawless, the next time he posts a Herald's Report.  (IMO, alleging
that a Player has 31 or more Blots is equivalent to alleging that that
Player is Lawless.)

Untrue.  Andre just executed a whole bunch of illegal POs.

Proto-Proposal
---
Holidays

Create a Rule ("Holidays") with MI=2 :

   A Holiday shall be declared whenever a Holiday Directive is 
   adopted. The Proposal containing such a Directive has an AI of at 
   least 2, and to be legal must specify a calendar day or a range of 
   calendar days in which that Holiday shall take place. The first 
   such Day must be at least two Nomic Weeks in the future at the 
   time such a Proposal is distributed. Lastly, the total duration of 
   a Holiday must not exceed twenty-eight days.

   A Holiday Directive which does not meet all these requirements shall
   not take effect even if adopted.

   Whenever a legal Holiday Directive is adopted, from midnight GMT 
   of the day immediately preceding the first day of the Holiday 
   until midnight GMT of the last day of the Holiday, all postings to 
   an Officer, a Player or the Public Forum, and all actions which 
   might alter the Game State, are legally null and void, without 
   effect altogether.

   Further, any period of time defined in the Rules, such that some 
   event, requirement, or any other alteration of the Game State 
   becomes required at the end of that period, is prolonged by as 
   many days as the Holiday is to last, if the end of that period 
  would otherwise take place within the duration of the Holiday.

   This Rule takes precedence over all other Rules.
---

WTD : an attempt at avoiding the confusion resulting from RL holidays 
such as Christmas by mirroring their effects within Agora. Of course, 
that wouldn't necessarily be a Good Thing : after all, holiday crises 
are _fun_. :)


Revision history :
1 - Apr. 22, original proto

========================================

I only dug up the very first version - I seem to remember there were 
one or two iterations, with minor improvements, but the basic ideas 
are in there. One of the features of this that Scott's proto doesn't 
have is lengthening of Rules-mandated periods the expiration of which 
would otherwise fall during the Holiday, rather than having such 
periods end when the Holiday ends - which could be undesirable if, 
say, said periods concerned delivering Judgement or any other act 
for which missing a deadline meant a penalty.

I shall need to bring the language in line with some new paradigms, 
of course - this is somewhat dated. :)

Then our timing of Elde's deregistration is off. But I think I agree 
with you. So much for that, then. :)

There's illegal, and there's illegal. "POs" executed by a person
without the authority to execute them are not POs. Basically what 
Andre and elJefe seem to be arguing is that I had no authority to 
issue these Injunctions - I am provisionally of the opinion that 
their ruling is that they were not Injunctions, but, as I have 
already stated, I haven't yet reached a definite conclusion.

The most recent case of a Player being penalized for an illegal
Injunction that I am aware of is CFJ 860. A long time ago, though
that does not necessary mean that such Game Custom does not still
have force.

> Statements from duly authorized Judges claiming to be Injunctions

Well, there's something to consider - if an Injunction is the cause 
of a Player being assigned a Blot, then it does have an effect - and 
you can probably argue that Rule 663, as it is presently worded, 
prevents Infractions of the sort it mentions in its last sentence to 
have *any* effects, be they proximal or distal.

I must admit that there's a weaker case than I first thought for the
line of defense that an illegal Injunction isn't actually an
Injunction - the above is the best argument I can come up with,
though it seems quite defensible.

Actually, you only discussed the appropriateness of the Injunctions.
elJefe discussed both their appropriateness and their legality;
thus, if Andre's decision is without legal significance, as I 
maintain it is, and will shortly be calling on the Courts to confirm, 
the only issue on which there is a majority in the Board of Appeals 
is that the Injunctions were not appropriate; a decision which I 
intend to have scrutinized very closely.

As you will not be surprised, I deny this claim. Although I would not
mind in the least if the courts decided otherwise.

Incroyable. Can this really be so? I had thought that the provision
in R1693 quoted above was supposed to apply in cases where the 3
Justices agree, say, to overturn the original Judgement, but two want
it reversed and one wants it dismissed. I didn't think it was to
apply to a simply majority 2-1 decision in favour of reversing a
Judgement. But to my consternation the provision does seem capable of
being interpreted as Andre thinks. What a ridiculous and annoying
situation.

Can anyone see a clear cut refutation of Andre's view?

This is one of the silliest arguments I have ever heard! The Board's
mandate was, as you note, the determination of the appropriateness
of the Injunctions. This naturally required the Board to reach a 
decision about what 'appropriate' means in R1695. The two are
inseparable. A mandate to do one just is a mandate to do the other.

What are you going to do? Make a CFJ alleging that the Board of 
Appeals overstepped its mandate in reaching the decision it did?
How would you expect a Judge to reach a decision about such a CFJ?
The Judge would have to consider the meaning of 'appropriate' in
R1695. But by your lights, the Judge would have no mandate to do
this, since eir mandate is only to make a Judgement either that
the CFJ is TRUE or that it is FALSE, not to consider the meanings
of words. The fact that Judge cannot do one without doing the other
you say need not concern us. I beg to differ: it should concern us
greatly if it were not so laughably implausible. If we believed it,
we should have to conclude that Judges have no mandate to interpret
the Rules; we should have to believe that Judgement is impossible.

Deference to the original Judge is irrelevant here: the Board was not
asked to consider your original Judgement of CFJ 1045. The policy of
deference to the original Judge, where it applies at all, applies in
cases where a Justice is considering whether or not to overturn a 
Judgement. That is not what we were asked to do.

A compelling reason certainly did exist: we were compelled to reach
a determination concerning the legality of the Injunctions. We could
not have avoided making new law, since however we chose to interpret
to R1695 would still have counted as interpreting it in some way or
other. Had we found that your Injunctions were legal, we would have
still have been interpreting R1695 and we would still have been making
new law, although had we done that it seems unlikely that you would
now be complaining that we overstepped our mandate. Your position,
bewildering as it is, appears to be that the Justices were required
to reach a decision without interpreting the Rules. If that's the
best argument you can produce, then maybe you *need* a month off.

Well, one could argue that elJefe is silent on the question of whether
to reverse, dismiss, or reassign, since e expressed no opinion on the
matter.  This could be interpreted so as to preserve the unanimity of
the Justices' opinions (silence implying consent).  

As an aside, I've been musing over a major reworking of the judicial
system, in which Judges are attached to CFJs indefinitely, removed
only for deregistration or by a recusal order from the Justiciar or
Clerk of the Courts.  Judging the CFJ does not remove oneself as the
Judge of that CFJ, as it does presently.  I haven't worked out all the
details yet.  One of the big effects is that going overtime won't
disqualify you automatically.

So let me get this straight: on the one hand you claim that the Board
had no mandate to closely scrutinize the legality of your Injunctions,
yet on the other hand you will now seek to have a Judge closely 
scrutinize the legality of the Board's decision? Tell me, will the
Judge have any greater mandate to inquire into the legality of our
actions than we did to enquire into yours?

It's precisely becuase you did have authority to issue them that
the Board was asked to consider their legality and appropriateness.
Had you merely posted the text of your Injunctions to the PF in your
capacity as an ordinary Player, then you would have had no authority
to issue Injunctions, and we certainly would have behaved as if no
Injunctions had been issued, because no Injunctions would have been
issued in that case. That would be analogous to my sending text to
the PF claiming to be a PO from you to Andre. Such a thing is not a PO.

Is there any special reason you use "enquire" and "inquire" in the same 
sentence? Do these words have different meanings that I'm not aware of, 
or was it just the luck of the draw, so to speak? I'm just curious..
