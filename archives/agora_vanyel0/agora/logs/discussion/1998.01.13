Protoproposal Chaos30 [rev. 1]

Holidays

Be it therefore resolved, that the following Rule be created, at Power
2:

      A Holiday is a period of time, not to exceed 7 days in length,
      designated as such by the Rules.  If one Holiday begins
      within 24 hours of the end of another Holiday, the two Holidays
      and the time between them are taken as a single Holiday, unless
      this would cause the combined Holiday to exceed 7 days in
      length, in which case the first Holiday is extended to 7 days
      and the second Holiday does not occur.

      During a Holiday, no Proposal may be distributed by the
      Promotor, nor may any Call for Judgement, Judgement, notice of
      Appeal, Decision of Appeals Boards, or Opinion be published by
      the Clerk of the Courts; however, if any of the above do take
      place during the Holiday in violation of this Rule, this Rule
      does not deprive them of their usual effects.  

      If some Rule requires that an action be done prior to a
      given time, and that given time falls during a Holiday, or
      within the twenty-four-hour period immediately following that
      Holiday, then that action need not be done until twenty-four
      hours after that Holiday ends.  If some Rule bases the time of a
      future event upon the time of another event, or requires that a
      Player perform some action within some time of another event,
      and that event occurs during a Holiday, the time at which the
      Holiday ends shall be used instead for the purpose of
      determining the time of the future event or of the time by which
      the Player must perform the specified action.  

      This Rule takes precedence over all Rules pertaining to the
      timing of events, and over all Rules which require Players to
      perform events before a specified time.

Having thought about it some more, I'd like to add the Chuck's argument
is not knockdown. I think an interesting question to ask here is: what
significance should we give to the use of parentheses in R1729's
provision: "And should it occur (due to greed or sin) / that no one
Votes FOR it, the Proposer shall Win."? I think there's a reasonable
case for saying that the use of parentheses in this fashion indicates
that we should take the parenthetical remarks as illustrative, ie
that we should read the provision as "And should it occur, for
example due to greed or sin..." etc. and not as restricting the
kinds of acceptable causal histories that occurrences of no votes
being cast on an Insane Proposals can have if they are to count as
Wins.

I don't think I saw this proto, or I didn't notice this provision.
I don't mind given some small reward, but most people don't seem to care
about it - why else would there be so many Disinterested Proposals?

If I go with the Limited Proposal Distribution system, and Petition Fees
are eliminated, I'm not exactly sure how you would determine the Proposal's
Sponsor. Should we go back to simply paying the Proposer? Has anyone
ever actually sponsored a proposal they did not write?

Yes.  I have paid the Petition Fee of at least one Proposal not
authored by myself, taking advantage of the loophole that allows you
to pay the Petition Fee for a Proposal any time up to the end of the
Voting Period.  The main reason I haven't done this more often is that
it's a cheap trick, barely worthy of the title of scam, and because
P-Notes are not very valuable at the moment. :)

I like this idea.

Yeah.  As Blob says though, it's quite nice to give different Officers
differing perks.  I for example can make people Officers in Perpetuity
as Registrar (Without Objection, of course), which is nice. 

The Rulekeepor has long been able to fiddle with categories and rule
titles in the Ruleset.

Do tell us what other ideas you have along these lines Blob.

I'm beginning to like this Queue idea more and more.  Especially since it
leaves a loophole for eventually repairing the game should P-notes
disappear (I know that could never happen, but call me paranoid :-).

I'll vote for this if it's proposed soon.

Because currently the reward is in P-notes, and nobody considers those
valuable (yet).

I will inset text from the proposal, while keeping my comments aligned
with the left margin.

      The duration of the period of denial is tolled while an Order
      denying Voting Privilege is stayed.

I strongly object to this wording on the grounds that it is obscure.
While "toll" may have the meaning you want it to in some circles, I do
not think we should adopt language that is unusual.  I did manage to
find a definition of "toll" that is probably what you mean (on the web
at http://www2.lib.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/www2/WEBSTER.sh?WORD=toll),
but I think your grammar is suspect even when you do read toll as "to
take away; to vacate; to anull".  How can you anull a duration?

      Knowingly and willfully executing invalid Orders constitutes the
      Class B Crime of Abuse of Authority.

      A Player who performs as required by an Order which is later
      found to be invalid is not liable for eir actions; but other
      Rules may establish procedures for correcting or remediating
      such circumstances when they occur.

I dislike the word "remediate" and according to the online Websters,
it's not even a verb, but rather a Shakespearian adjective meaning
remedial.  I suggest you replace "remediating" with "remedying".

      An Order is a command, executed by a Player and directed to some
      entity requiring that entity to perform exactly one action, or
      to refrain from performing one or more actions.  An Order may be
      directed to the holder of an Office or other official position
      in eir capacity as that Office or other official position, and
      in this case if the Office or position changes hands before the
      Order is satisfied, the duty to abide by the Order automatically
      attaches to the new holder of that Office or position.  An
      Order, the purpose of which is to affect the operation of a
      prior Order, is as valid as any other Order, even if not
      directed at any particular entity.

This does not make it clear that Orders may specify when an action is
to be performed.  The language for Transfer Orders does seem to allow
this implicitly, so I think you should mention it here as well.  I
think you should also perhaps make Orders that require an action,
require it as sson as possible by default.

Incidentally, are there any examples of Orders that require something
not to happen?

In general, I really like this proposal.

Thanks for all the work on it,
Michael.

Have we considered making all entities pay (VTs) for each unit of currency
minted ?  The cost (in VTs) could be designated by the mintor at the time of
creation of that currency type (or at time of Rule enactment for existing
currencies) and would then be unable to be changed. This cost per currency
would be the currency's "official" value, usable at any time when a value needs
to be assigned.

btw this rule would also apply to the bank, but as the bank receives payment
for currency minting it would _effectively_ cost thebank nothing. Imagine the
PO from the bank to the bank ordering the bank to pay the bank a certain number
of VTs for the creation of that number of VTs by the bank. I like it ! :o)

This idea doesn't take into account the demand for a currency but, as G.Chaos
has already pointed out, value based on demand is subjective anyway.

You might also argue that not voting (because it's prohibited) is a
greedy act - not to gain something, but to avoid punishment. After
all, Morendil's attempt to vote got him nothing but trouble...

Rather than hunt down and reply to the original messages, I think I'll
simply mention some recent PROTOs whichI would really like to see adopted,
and pledge support for them:

- Plots, obviously (can this get proposed finally, please?)
- Proposal Queue (nice way to get those P-Notes spent. Remember 
  to rewrite Sanity and Emergency proposals to work with it...)
- Officer's Veto (aaah, the joys of Officerhood...)
- Indenture (I really like this. I want to buy someone at
  auction, dammit!)

Sub-PROTO Effectiveness Determination (version 3)

      The effect of a step of a procedure to change the Game State
      shall be determined using the best evidence available to the
      person primarily responsible for reporting the outcome of the
      procedural step.  Such a person's reasonable and good faith
      determination of whether the procedural step is effective is
      definitive, even if it is based on erroneous information.

[2: Attempted to make only one person responsible.
Added "step" to handle e.g. Proposals which are handled in several
steps by more than one Officer.
Also changed "determination that" into "determination of whether".
3: Removed legality from consideration.]

I am currently separating the Auctions mechanism to Propose
separately, and will shortly send up revised protos for both
Auctions and Indentures.

This part of the report is not mandated by the Rules, and I just made
it up.  I could put Indulgences there but there's more to the Herald's
report than just this, so I didn't bother.

Whoops, sorry.  Posted 1505 twice and 1042 not at all.  Here it is:

Rule 1042/9 (Power=1)
Deregistration due to Silence

      Each Player is either Noisy, Quiet or Silent. Whenever a Player
      posts to the Public Forum, or a new Player registers, that
      Player is Noisy.

      Any Player can cause another Active Noisy Player to become
      Quiet by stating that e is doing so, and clearly identifying
      that Player, in the Public Forum.  If a Player has been Quiet
      continuously for two weeks, e becomes Silent.  If a Player has
      been Inactive continuously for two months, e becomes Silent.

      Any Player can cause a Silent Player to be deregistered by
      stating in the Public Forum that the Silent Player has
      Abandoned the game. If the Speaker is Silent, and it is alleged
      in the Public Forum that e has Abandoned the Game, e commits
      the Class A Crime of Speaker Abandonment. E ceases to be
      Speaker, and the Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker. E is then
      deregistered. In either case, the Registrar shall, as soon as
      possible after an allegation in the Public Forum that a Player
      has Abandoned the game, confirm or deny in the Public Forum
      that the deregistration has actually occurred.

      The Registrar shall include in eir Report the most recent
      date on which each Player changed from being Noisy, Quiet or
      Silent to any of the others.

Because the reward is a reward of P-Notes. In the scarce VT environment
I'm proposing, Players will havemuch reason to care about two VTs, if
they can get them.

I think I have, once or twice, but it's not a feature I think we
desperately need. I'm happy just to pay the Proposer.

It's unavoidable, given my desire to impose real VT scarcity. I suppose
I could try reducing everyone's VT holdings in proportion, in the manner
of RGB I & II. Would you prefer that?

How does this get you out of the fire? If the good faith determination
is definitive, then Scott's worries about error have not been addressed.

I'm worried about Plots: I fear they will reintroduce massive VT
inflation just at the time when we may finally be about to be rid of it.
I'm also skeptical about Indenture: it seems like a very complex response
to a situation (Lawlessness) which hardly ever occurs. Remember how
much trouble we had defining the abilities of Executors in Probate,
when there were considered to be Executors? I'm sure we'll have
similar problems understanding the relationship between an Indentured
Player and eir owner. I'd much prefer the far simpler solution of
suspending the voting rights of Lawless Players.

This seems to coincide nicely with the Plot's proto - you need to spend 
Ergs in order to mint other currencies. Maybe this mechanism could be
generalised (as I believe Scott has been contemplating recently - I haven't
exactly been following the discussion.)

BTW: I still haven't received a copy of the Indenture Proto. Would someone
please forward it to me?

Well, make a suggestion! The numbers are open to modification. Also, 
the whole point of the Plots proto is to make the system somewhat 
self-balancing. If VTs are inflated, then people will have less of an 
incentive to producte them, and the production will drop. If VTs, 
P-Notes and Ergs are all overabundant (and, if my quick mental check 
serves me, I doubt they would be), people will build Churches, which 
'produce' Indulgences (although they really steal them from others 
:-).

But indenture is *fun*! It would also encourage voters to make 
Lawlessness more common, I expect :-)

I assume that this is because General Chaos has succeeded in getting
the loss of Salary penalty removed for failing to Report. All very well
and good, but it does have an undesirable consequence. The Assessor,
for instance, has a Salary of 3 VTs. Under the new regime, if e fails
to report, he still gets this Salary. The penalty for FtR is only
2 VTs, so effectively, the Assessor will have made 1 VT profit despite
not performing eir duties.

I think it would have made more sense to keep the loss of Salary 
provisions for failure to Report, and met Scott's legitimate concerns
about the double whammy (loss of Salary, plus the 2 VT + 2 Blot penalty
for FtR), by getting rid of the VT penalty for committing the Infraction
of FtR. This would mean that in every case, failure to report would result
in loss of Salary and some Blots, but no extra VT penalty beyond that.
I regard that outcome as fair.

This is fair, however, because the Assessor has many duties, while the
penalty is predicated only on the nonperformance of the duty to report
Voting Token balances.  It seems unfair to me to predicate the entire
salary of the Assessor on whether e performs only one of his several
duties -- and not the most important of those duties, I might add.

Very well, I'll make the change. Should there be a similar penalty for
proposals that fail? (Probably not...)

So make a suggestion about how to keep this from happening! Personally, I
would just reccommend drastically reducing the outputs of Farms to an
amount that would keep them scarce: perhaps 2 VTs per Farm, which would put
(I think) 10 VTs as the absolute cap on the number of VTs one could get a
week, if a Player specialized in VTs at the expense of all other currencies
