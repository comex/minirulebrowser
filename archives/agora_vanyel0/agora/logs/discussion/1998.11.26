I certainly don't think that you don't know what you're doing. You've
been excellent Promotor and Assessor. But that doesn't mean you're

Not a problem, I'm sorry for jumping at you like that.

The Promotor's job has just recently got very time consuming. I might
have to pass it on sometime soon. I am reluctant to let it go, it's 
lots of fun - probably the most interesting office we have. Certainly
the most influential. But I have a thesis to do (I know I've said that
many times before, but still...)

I dedicate far too much time to this game. If I don't end up with a
Doctor of Nomic before I go, I will be sorely disappointed. What can I
write a thesis about?

Do *you* check the record *every* time you allege someone has made a
mistake? Have you *never* alleged that someone might have a mistake, and
yourself been mistaken? I don't understand what all the fuss is about. I
didn't officially allege that Blob had made an error. I didn't make a
COE. I just wanted clarification on a small point, because my Proposal
had not appeared in Blob's revised Queue (because, it turns out, the
revisions represented the Queue at a time prior to my submission). This
kind of exchange ("Is that right?" - "Yes, it is." - "Oh. Ok.") happens
all the time without anyone's being reminded what it behooves them to
do.

Except that your phraseology came across (at least to me) as
expressing your belief that there was error, instead expressing a
concern that there may have been error.  Perhaps your intent was less
than clear.

What I actually said was, "Unless General Chaos raised the priority of
his Proposal 'Ten Days Is Too Long' to 2, then this is an error." I
think a reasonable person could have concluded from this that I was
uncertain whether or not there had been an error, but was concerned
enough about it to ask. 

But in any case, what does it really matter? You seem more perturbed
about it than Blob, who is surely the only person in this case whose
opinion matters.
