I think my official state is now one of confusion, so I propose to
start from scratch and see where the Rules lead me, making no
assumptions about synonymy between 'being counted' and 'being legal'.
Here are what I take to be the relevant Rules, arranged from lowest
to highest precedence.

R1442:The casting of any votes may only be achieved by the spending
      of VTs, as specified below.

      A Voting Entity's Votes on a given Proposal are counted for that
      Proposal only if the delayed Transfer Order implicitly submitted
      by Voting on that Proposal is successfully executed at the end
      of the Voting Period of that Proposal.

R683: A Vote is legally cast if it is cast during the Voting Period
      of that Proposal, and if that Voting Entity is entitled to cast
      a Vote on that particular Proposal.

R206: The casting of any votes may only be achieved by the casting of
      Voting Tokens, as specified in other Rules.

R955: When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the Votes which
      have been legally cast shall be counted by the Assessor.

Question: what happens when a Player who is entitled to vote sends a
message to the PF purporting to vote, but there is no expenditure of
VTs at the end of the VP for whatever reason?

R1442 states that you can't cast a vote without spending VTs. However,
I think I now agree with you (contrary to my former declarations), that
R1442 is trumped by the higher precedence R683, which imposes a different
and conflicting condition on what it is to 'legally cast' a vote.

In your analysis, however, you seem to have missed that R683 is itself
trumped by the still higher precedence R206, which reasserts, more
forcefully because of the higher precedence, that votes cannot be
cast without expenditure of VTs.

Note that I am here asserting the synonymy of 'cast' and 'legally
cast', to the extent that I understand Rules 1442, 683 and 206 all to
be talking about the same thing. I am also interpreting the 'casting
of Voting Tokens' as synonymous with 'the spending of Voting Tokens'
in R206. (Cf also R1547, where the same construction is used.)

Note also that none of the above remarks have anything to do with
votes being 'counted'. In this I think I now also agree with you that
being counted is different from being legal. Hence I concur with you
that the second of the paragraphs I quoted above from R1442 is
potentially in conflict with R955, in that R1442 seeks to impose a
different and conflicting condition on what it is for a vote to be
counted. If for some reason it became possible to legally cast votes
without spending VTs, the very high precedence R955 would force us
to count those votes. However, at present, the fairly high precedence
R206 prevents this situation from arising. As far as I can tell, this
is only flaw in your otherwise excellent analysis.

There. I feel much better.

Belated addendum: it occurs to me that 'spending' of VTs may not
require the actual *execution* of the implicit delayed Transfer Order
referred to in R1442, only its *submission*. I even have a sneaking
suspicion that we have a prior Judgement more or less exactly to that
effect. (Can anyone authoritatively confirm or deny this?) If that is
so, then R206 does not prevent one from legally casting votes without
executing a Transfer Order for VTs. Neither does any other Rule. In
that case, R955 does indeed force us to count votes as legal which
result from messages sent to the PF purporting to be votes.

Mad Scientist Oerjan's Predict-o-matic seems to be working well. All
the post-PC Proposals which we at first thought had passed, and then
thought had failed, did in fact pass, if the above remarks are correct.
Our New Year's crisis is early this year.

You have just saved me from typing a lengthy response to your previous post 8).
 This is precisely what I pointed out in a previous post of my own about R206. 
The procedure for "spending a VT" is only defined in R1442, and R1442 doesn't
say that you actually have to have a VT to spend a VT, you just have to follow
its directions which result in an implicit, delayed TO being submitted.  I
spend money all the time, without actually having any in the bank.  8)

I think there is a flaw in your reasoning: I think you make an
unwarranted assumption about what it means to spend/cast a VT.
I'll agree with you that the two are synonymous.

It seems to me there are two possible meanings as to what it
is to "spend" a VT in this contest: either VTs are "spent"
when the delayed implicit TO is created, or when the TO is
executed.  I will grant you that the latter is perhaps the more
natural interpretation of "spend" standing on it's own; however,
only the former interpretation--that VTs are spent when the delayed
implicit TO is created--is consistent with R1442.

      The casting of any votes may only be achieved by the spending
      of VTs, as specified below.
[...]
      A Voting Entity may specify that e casts no Votes on a Proposal,
      and doing so cancels any previously Votes cast on that Proposal
                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      (if done during the Voting Period of that Proposal) and cancels
      any delayed Transfer Orders submitted but not yet executed by
      Voting on that Proposal.

Which implies that a Vote is "cast" when the voting message is sent to the
Assessor, and not at the end of the Voting Period.  Since casting
votes may only be achieved by "spending of VTs, as specified below",
this implies to me that "spending of VTs" occurs when the implicit
delayed TO is created, and not when the TO is executed.

erg.  Fortunately, I think that only involved three proposals, but
I dread going back and digging that up again.

Crito, you and I all seem to have converged on the same answer. OK, next
question: does the infection of R1598 prevent even the submission of
implicit delayed Transfer Orders?

A cursory examination of Rules 1730 and 1731 indicates to me that
it does not, although admittedly I have not looked at them too
closesly.

I think the reasoning I've seen posted is that they're _now_ being held in
the normal manner, though while Morendil was a non-Player for a few days
(without being dergistered) they were not.

This is still enough to precipitate an Election, but a curious consequence
is that if there is no Winner in the election, there would be no reason to
hold another one.

You're right. I mis-spoke in claiming that they are *now* held
temporarily; they were held temporarily and that's enough to prompt
the Election.

This CfJ was submitted by Anarchy.
The Bailiff was Anthony..

The following statement was distributed on Wed, 3 Dec 1997 16:16:00 GMT:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Death checks at the end of a week take place after score calculations
are made.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
No other comment was made.

Luke returneth was chosen as a Devil's Advocate.
E argued as follows:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
My admittedly FLIMSY arguments are based SOLELY on a careful reading
of Rule 1080, which states:
"At the end of each week, the following checks are made to see if any
Players have Died ... "

The IMPLICATION is that the checks are made to see IF a Player has
Died DURING the Week, from any cause whatsoever. So, they may take
place BEFORE all score calculations.

However, in CERTAIN circumstances, scores may drop to ZERO during the
WEEK, though they will not actually be ALTERED until the end of the
Week. This point is based on a CAREFUL reading of Rule 304, which
states: "Any action ... which would result in ... a negative score at
that point in time ..."  (and thus possibly contradicts ITSELF).

APOLOGIES for the EXCESSIVE use of CAPITALS; it's a PHASE I'm going
through.  I don't know if I have full CONFIDENCE in this ADVOCACY, so
would advise any JUDGE to disregard it ENTIRELY if e wants ...

Hmm.  This seems circular to me, unless you are making "countable" and "legal"
synonyms for the same attribute, in which case there is no way for any Rule to
ever conflict with R955's first sentence, since a Rule of any Power or
precedence can make any type of vote illegal simply by declaring that a
particular type of vote shall not be counted.

I tend to think of them as distinct attributes, and I don't find any Rule which
explicitly states that countability is a requirement for legality.  As a matter
of fact, R683 makes it very clear that the only attributes required for
legality are, one, the vote is cast by an entity entitled to cast it, and, two,
it is cast within the voting period.  I think this makes it clear that all such
votes are legal, whether you have a VT to back them or not, and thus R1442
conflicts with R955 when it seeks to prevent unbacked votes from being counted.
To work properly, R1442 should have declared such votes illegal and claimed
precedence over R683, or should have declared precedence over R955.

It depends whether you want to allow the Assessor the option to legally
include, by accident or deliberately, information which may be false or
misleading.

Flirting with paradox, I see. Tell me: which Nomics are eligible to
vote on this Proposal?

In any case, I urge all member Nomics to vote against this Proposal
on the grounds that it is unjust. If New Rishonnomic is currently a
voting member, why should it be stripped of its voting rights? It is
a Nomic in good standing as much as any of the other voting members.
A just Proposal would have *added* 'New Rishonomic' to list of
voting members. I would make such a Proposal myself, but I think
it's important to settle the question of voting eligibility first,
through the Internomic Courts. Am I right in thinking that only
the various Liaisons have the right to call SFJs?

There are good reasons to deny that the two typos should be treated
similarly. The typo 'ammend' does not result in any ambiguity in
meaning.  The typo 'Rishonnomic' certainly has resulted in there
being an ambiguity in meaning. I believe that it precisely in order
to explore how Internomic will deal with this ambiguity that New
Rishonnomic has come into existence.

Once it is granted that there is currently an ambiguity as to which
Nomic the string 'New Rishonnomic' in Rule 215 currently refers to,
the question then becomes: how best to resolve this ambiguity? 
Different principles of interpretation are available, and they will
yield different answers to this question. You appeal to a kind of
'intention of the framers' principle to justify your conclusion that
'New Rishonnomic' refers to the Nomic whose Liaison is the Voting
Gnome. But that is not the end of the argument; it is only the
beginning. Other principles are available. In Agora, for example,
Judges have repeatedly rejected the intention of the framers as a
guide to interpretation in favour of more literal readings, holding
firstly that, in general, the intention of the framers is too opaque
to be a reliable interpretative guide, and secondly (and I think more
importantly), that in the context of a game in which much of the play
consists in interpreting rules, taking those rules as we find them
leads to more interesting and creative play than interpreting them as
we think they were probably intended. Now, I am not so naive as to
argue that Internomic should adopt any particular principle of
interpretation just because Agora does. Nevertheless, this second
principle should be considered by any hypothetical Internomic Judge
called upon judge the matter, and the arguments on which it based may
well be just as persuasive to an Internomic Judge as they have been
to Agoran Judges. After all, those arguments do not rely on any
features particular to Agora, but proceed from general principles
about what makes an interesting game of Nomic. I think an Internomic
Judge who was so persuaded would be justified in finding that, since
there undoubtedly are two Nomic, one called 'New Rishonnomic' and one
called 'New Rishonomic', and since Rule 215 mentions only 'New
Rishonnomic' as a voting member, that it is the former Nomic and not
the latter which is a voting member of Internomic.
