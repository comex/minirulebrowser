So noted.

I really think this should be 3 weeks. If the Promotor chooses to distribute
a new batch after 4 days of the suspension have passed, Time Agent will not
effectively be denied the right to vote on any Proposals.

Maybe e should be disallowed to vote on anything _distributed_ in the next
2 weeks. Or would that be too difficult for the Assessor to keep track of?

Steve asks :

> What was the text of R594 before it took its current form?

Why, Steve - according to Rule 417, you're supposed to have that 
information. Maybe I'll run for Archivist once more... ;)

I was able to dig it up (actually, I reconstructed it from 594/1 of
a real old Ruleset dated Nov. 19, 1995, and my Official records - I
have all such since October 1995 or thereabouts and am thus in
principle able to reconstruct the Historical Ruleset that far back).

Rule 594/2 (Mutable, MI=1)
Proposals and Rule Changes

      A Proposal may contain one or more Rule Changes.  If a Proposal
      containing Rule Changes is adopted, the Rule Changes contained
      in the Proposal shall take effect in the order they appear in
      the Proposal.

      Unless another Rule states otherwise, the Adoption Index of a
      Proposal shall be the minimum Adoption Index which would allow
      all Rule Changes and Directives within the Proposal to take
      effect, or 1, whichever is greater.

      In no case may a Proposal have an Adoption Index of less than 1.

More fun with Priority

Amend Rule 1771 to read :

      An Entity may increase or decrease the Priority of a proposal by
      notifying the Promotor that e does so, and paying a number of
      P-Notes to the Bank. For each P-Note e pays to the Bank, the
      Priority of the Proposal is changed by one, provided that this
      transfer is not executed for any other purpose. The Priority of
      a Proposal may not be reduced below zero in this manner.

I don't deny that there's a place for FRC/Mornington Crescent-style
games where this sort of thing is possible--but I don't want to see
Agora turn into one.

Imagine a continuum of styles of playing games--from 
"Win by any means necessary, including cheating if you
can get away with it" through "win by any means necessary within
the Rules" through "win, but do it stylishly" to "be stylish,
and don't worry about winning at all."

Each person has a different style of playing, and further,
a person's style will vary between different games, and even
within a game.  Also, certain games encourage different styles
of play, and depending on the nature of the game the players'
styles will be more or less closely clustered around the mean.
For example, chess tends to encourage people to cluster very closely
around the "win by any menas necessary within the Rules," and in
fact, many traditional games do this.  The mean of players'
styles in FRC probably falls somewhere between "win, but stylishly"
and "just be stylish", but also, the styles of players are not
as closely clustered around the mean as for chess.

To make a FRC/Mornington Crescent-style game (where anyone can
win at any time they choose, and everyone knows this) effective,
you need to have all players' playing styles be pretty far to
the "stylish" end of the continuum.  Agora, I think, is pretty
open to all styles of play--while most players fall more to the stylish
end of the continuum, we are still open--and should be!--to players
who are more towards the "winning" end of the continuum.

Maybe this is just a long-winded way of saying "I don't want
Agora to become a FRC/MC type game", but, well, I don't.

Amend 1770 (Distributing Proposals) by replacing the word "five" with
"four" wherever it appears.

[This would increase the competition between proposers to get their
proposals distributed. Recently, on average less than five proposals
were made very week, and some of those were made by me not only
because I did want to propose the minor fixes they contain, but also
because I wanted to keep the proposal queue filled. A proposal queue
with five or less proposals in it is essentially useless; this proto
would lower the threshold.

Heck, we could even make it three! Or why not two? I hear you say that
we can then not keep the game moving. Well, not necessarily - we could
also try out a completely new (to Agora) RL aspect of politics, that
of tying several, more or less unconnected proposals up into one
packet that is then adopted or rejected as a whole. That would allow
exploring some new aspects of group politics etc.]

Y'know, this doesn't actually SAY that the Priority changes in the requested 
direction...

Good point.  In fact, by putting the third sentence after the second
that way, it seems to imply that the Priority is _lowered_ for each
P-Note added to it...

I don't see why it would be. I'd have no problem with this, as Assessor.

I keep meaning to get to that Archivist reform...

Certainly a very different to R594/3, as Chuck suspected.

I know that R1036 doesn't require it of you, (although in my view it
should), but could you please include the name of the Proposer in the
Proposal Queue?

This is not a bad idea, but I think it fair that the Proposer of
a Proposal be given an advantage over other entities. What I suggest
is that the Proposer be allowed to increase or decrease Priority
at a cost of 1 P-Note per unit change in Priority, but that for other
entities, the cost per unit change of Priority should be 3 P-Notes.

A related idea: let the Promotor announce, with, say, 4 days notice,
what the threshold will be for the following week, provided that it
doesn't exceed five. This would give the Promotor an interesting toy
to play with: some weeks he might announce that only 2 Proposals will
be voted on next week - get those P-Note transfers in now! - while in
other weeks, e might consider it to eir advantage (or e might be
bribed) to allow the full five Proposals to be distributed. This
would go well with the idea Morendil just protoed to allow entities
other than Proposers to change the Priority of Proposals.

Which, of course, they can already do. What I *should* have said
was: "This will go well with the idea Morendil just protoed to
allow entities to lower the Priority of Proposals."

I don't think we should get rid of Quorum. It has another purpose
which you don't mention, namely that Proposals don't get passed by
one or two Players while no-one is paying attention. I think it's
good that at least saome significant fraction of Players have to vote
or declare Presence on a Proposal before it can be adopted.

It follows that I share some of your reservations about the current
Quorum tools, particularly Quorum Buyback. Waiving Quorum I don't
have such a problem with, since it can only be done Without
Objection, and that is a pretty big constraint on its use. But
Buyback in its current form I don't much like. I'd be happy enough to
see it repealed, but if we're going to keep it, then I think we should
at least constrain its use so that Quorum cannot be lowered by more
than two by the Buyback mechanism. What do you think?

####
Proto-Proposal
Variable Batch Sizes

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule entitled "The Promotor can change
the Batch Size" be created with the following text:

      The Batch Size is an integer with a value between two and six
      inclusive, indicating the number of Proposals which will be
      distributed by the Promotor in the following Nomic Week. Unless
      the Rules give it another value, the Batch Size is five.

      The Promotor may change the value of the Batch Size by
      announcing the new value in the Public Forum, provided that
      e announces a value between two and six inclusive, and
      provided that e has not already made such an announcement
      earlier in the week. As indicated above, this change in the
      Batch Size has the effect of changing the number of Proposals
      which will be distributed by the Promotor in the Nomic Week
      *following* that in which the change is made; once the Week has
      begun, the Promotor cannot change the number of Proposals which
      will be distributed in that Week by changing the Batch Size.
      
Be it further resolved that R1770 (Distributing Proposals) be amended
by replacing the text in which currently reads:

      If there are five or fewer Proposals in the Proposal Queue
      having a Priority greater than zero, then the batch shall
      consist of all such Proposals.

      If there are more than five such proposals, then the batch
      shall consist of the first five such Proposals, in the order
      given by the Queue.

with text which reads:

      If the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue with a
      Priority greater than zero is less than or equal to the Batch
      Size, then the batch shall consist of all such Proposals.

      If the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue is greater
      than the Batch Size, then the batch shall consist of those
      Proposals in the Queue with the highest Priority such that the
      number of Proposals distributed is equal to the Batch Size.

Along the lines of my last question, what happens if there aren't two
proposals?  This rule clearly states that the Promotor must release at
least two in the following week...

Is there a reason that the Batch size under your proposed amendement
can't be 0 or 1?  While the former I can understand, the latter seems
completely valid to me...

Right. I'll have to add a qualification, as follows:

      The Batch Size is an integer with a value between two and six
      inclusive, indicating the number of Proposals which will be
      distributed by the Promotor in the following Nomic Week,
      assuming that there are that many Proposals in the Proposal
      Queue to be distributed. Unless the Rules give it another
      value, the Batch Size is five.

No logical reason, no, but good reasons of policy. Basically, if the
Batch Size is too small, VT expenditure drops too low. I nearly made
the minimum batch size three, for this reason.
