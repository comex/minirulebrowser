If that's right - and it sounds plausible - then I think we should
tweak the system to allow some anticipation of Transfer Orders not
yet created. This ability needs to be constrained. One way to do it
is to allow it only in cases where the yet-to-be-created TO is
clearly identified, where I take it that Crito's statement does
clearly identify such a TO.

Did we ever reach a consensus on whether Payment Orders (the
Pragmatic Currencies ones, I mean) are Nomic Entities or not? Much
that is significant to the debate might turn on the answer to that
question, since if the PC-POs are not Nomic Entities, then that
premise becomes a solid plank in an argument that they cannot be
identical with (units of) Morendil's Currency of the name, which I
take it *are* Nomic Entities (although some have argued to the
contrary). I recall providing an argument, which I'll repeat here
without necessarily endorsing it, that they are not Nomic Entities:
they are bodies of text (or, more broadly, messages), created by
Players, and hence do not owe their existence qua bodies of text
solely to the Rules. On the other hand, these bodies of text do have
the Nomic Property of being Transfer Orders, so one might be tempted
to say that they owe their existence qua Transfer Orders solely to
the Rules, since it is only the Rules that confer legal significance
on certain bodies of text. So perhaps they are Nomic Entities after
all. Whatever answer we give here should apply also to Applications,
SLCs, Opinions and the like. Do we want to say that these things were
Nomic Entities? Or do we prefer to keeping that tag for things like
Kudos, VTs, Locations, and Morendil's Misanthropist-minted 'Transfer
Orders'?  

Where do people stand on these questions?

I think you may have misunderstood me (not your fault, reading back
what I wrote, it is a little unclear). I am possibly one of those
very people who wants to identify Rules, Proposals, SLC, Applications,
Opinions and PC Orders with bodies of text, or more broadly, with
messages. Once we've made such an identification, we can then go on
to talk about various properties of these messages, some of which
will be Nomic Properties, in which the Rules place some legal
significance.  The identification seems to me to be at least prima
facie plausible, although I'm still investigating all the pros and
cons.

My view, shared I think by Scott and some others, is that in that
case, the voting message is deemed to be a Transfer Order. Ie, the
Rules impute to voting messages the property of being Transfer 
Orders of a certain kind.

Granted, but this is a problem only if one absolutely insists that
Proposals, Rules, Applications, SLCs, Opinions, PC Orders and such
like be granted the status of Nomic Entities. There are two reasons
why one might want to drop such an insistence:

(1) You might want to reserve the tag 'Nomic Entity' for such things
as Kudos, Currencies, Patent Titles, Winner's Cups and Locations, none
of which are (associated with) bodies of text.

(2) You might want to get rid of the concept of 'Nomic Entity' entirely.
After all, what does it matter whether an Application is a Nomic Entity
or not? None of its Nomic Properties can be changed except by procedures
specified in the Rules, and none of its non-Nomic properties (eg who wrote
it and when) can be changed at all, and faking them for the purposes
of deception is quite difficult, as we've discussed in another context.

If you like (1), then I've got a nice new definition of Nomic Entity
for you: a Nomic Entity is an Entity all of whose properties are
Nomic Properties.

Many Italian and German card games, eg Skat and its variations, are
for three players. When four gather to play, the fourth is nominated
scorekeeper and sometimes dealer, with that position rotating, so that
a different player sits out each hand. But the scorekeeper is still
a player.

Elde had Payment Orders in Indulgences; the Bank is therefore a

It would be nice if the Rules reflected a consistent metaphysical view
of these matters. But we'd have to be extremely lucky for things
actually to turn out that way, given that the Rules are written by
different people at different times, and in different circumstances.
In the context of the current discussion about Nomic Entities, I agree
that talking of the 'destruction' of Applications is unfortunate. I
regard it basically as a kind of loose talk, especially since R1626
says straight out that an Application is a body of text created by a
Player. So we should not talk of its 'destruction', but rather of its
'ceasing to have legal significance'.

Oh hey, I disagree with that - I pointed this out some time ago but it
failed to elicit much comment. Suppose that you are Notary and I send
you a Will - on paper. (This is to avoid the problem raised by 'a
body of text' in the context of mail messages, since such a body of
text is duplicated several times while being transported over the Net.)

Now the contents of a given 'body ot text' are not a Nomic Property,
right ? So what's to prevent you from scratching out the line where
I leave all of my precious Cat Foods to MFO and adding a line which
says that you are to be the beneficiary of this heritage ?

Delayed TOs are explicitly allowed. Conditional TOs are not, and IMHO
should be prohibited. Also I doubt very much that your inclusion of
the phrase "at this time" leaves any doubt that it precisely was _not_
a delayed TO. But that's for the better, this notion of proactive TOs
is an interesting new twist.

Incidentally, I was trying to find this information out yesterday, and
was wondering if it might be something you could include in future
Registrar's Reports (i.e., a list of those who are Maybe Absent).

You also need to go through the Ruleset and remove all the other references
to Nomic Entities. For this Proposal to really accomplish anything, it
should go through and change all the Rules defining various Entities so
that they define them via their Properties.

Perhaps "...came into being due solely to the Rules..." would be better in
that case.

I did add the language you suggested, if you notice. For some reason the
create/destroy language is still in there; I'll take that out for the final
proposal. Now, do you also object to the Chancellor needing to create
Indulgences when Blots are issued and destroy them when Blots are paid? If
we don't have that, where are the Indulgences going to come from? I suppose
we could just create a whole bunch of Indulgences in the Bank. I suppose
I'll have to go with that; we can make additional fine-tunings later.

Exactly. Which is where my point about the complexity came up -- it's
actually easier to accomplish this sort of convincing in Agora than it is
in Monopoly. There, you can easily see if anything has caused you to gain
or lose money on your turn. In Agora, you have to pay attention to every
Rule which requires Players to issue TOs or POs and all judicial precedent
regarding them. Pulling a scam of misinformation out of that is entirely
possible. Of course, as Steve mentions, theft in general is much easier in
Monopoly, but I think this example if nothing else cements the similarity.

Echoes of Lewis Carroll... anyone have a record of the relevant passage,
the one about a song's name being different from what it was called?

Well, yes and no. It does describe alternative strategies to spoil
MMM, I agree. However, my post was not an attempted comprehensive
listing of all anti-MMM strategies discussed so far, it was just an
outline of the one strategy I prefer.

My list of points a) to c) was not one of all the different possible
overall strategies. It was a list of different interpretations of the
effect of 1586, _under the condition_ that steps 1. and 2. in my post:

are a correct description of what happened before the adoption of PC.
The variants Crito quickly summarized in eir reply basically say that
my description of 1. and/or 2. is wrong.

And I dislike them because I would prefer to accept the situation
created by steps 1 and 2 as I described them and then spoil MMM later,
by a suitable application of 1586 in step 3. This seems to me to be a
little less improvised. Not also that it does not involve challenging
the established (or, at least, the naive and common sense) way of
thinking about basics like naming and Nomic Entities. 

Challenging steps 1. and 2. as I described them (and, I gather,as
Morendil intended them) would be a bit of an overreaction in my eyes,
like shooting sparrows with cannonballs (is there a saying like that
in English?), and also in more risk of creating new loopholes with the
fix of an old one.

R1586 clearly states that an NE is something that exists only due to the Rules
defining it.

Scott has made a good defense of e, which I won't repeat here.

You caught me with that remark and the underlined part of my own

ways to spoil MMM. I'm not saying that the one I outlined is the only
feasible one, I would just prefer it for style reasons, and to
minimize the risk of creating new loopholes (and unintuitive ways of
dealing with names and NEs), as I stated above.

Now Scott may well call this nitpicking again, but I still don't
believe that is an appropriate description of implicitly submitted TOs
in general, and those created by 1442 in particular. So far I haven't
seen an argument how the statement "the voting message is deemed to be
a Transfer Order" can be justified when 1442 states that it is "the
_act_ of submitting the vote" that comprises the implicit submission of
a TO. 

However, I will admit to anyone who asks me that I keep talking about
details like this because I don't feel I have a clear grasp of the
overall problem ;).

What helped me a little in the more general direction was Steve's
remark: 

>>
(2) You might want to get rid of the concept of 'Nomic Entity' entirely.
After all, what does it matter whether an Application is a Nomic Entity
or not? None of its Nomic Properties can be changed except by procedures
specified in the Rules, ...[snip]
<<

If I understand correctly what was said about the origin of the NE
concept within the Agora rules, then it was not introduced because
someone wanted to fix eir metaphysical principles in some rules, but
for the very practical purpose of avoiding arbitrary manipulation of
entities that are relevant for the game, but not explicitly protected
against unwanted manipulations by some rule or other.

So although it is not explicitly defined this way, really a Nomic
Entity is meant to be any entity that can in principle manipulated in
a way that is not explicitly provided for in the rules and that is not
wanted by other players. Example: The points needed for winning in
InterNomic and the way Ackanomic won the game by CFJ 5.

And rules like 1586 were made to avoid this. It seems to me we want a
new, more intuitive and direct way to avoid it; maybe Steve's
suggestion to define NEs as having only Nomic Properties is such a way
- maybe the whole term Nomic Entity can be avoided alltogether, and
restrictions can be made just for changing Nomic Properties of _any_
entities. 

Maybe we can also generalize the strategy behind the PC reform:
let important entities be controlled by one officer; let em be the
only one whi is authorized to effectively change the entity or its
properties; allow other players only to request (or order) changes
from this officer. Abuse by the responsible officer might then become
technically possible: more politics - how much "cheating" or
corruption can I get away with without being impeached?

It seems kinda clunky.  Why not just leave them in the Bank?  It's not
like their being there make any difference.

They can be created when needed.  The Chancellor has an interest in

Well spotted that man.  The passage in question is from "Through the
looking glass" and is where the White Knight is talking about the song
he sings to Alice. 

Michael 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

(With thanks to the Project Gutenberg)

It's long,' said the Knight, `but very, VERY beautiful.  Everybody
that hears me sing it--either it brings the TEARS into their eyes, or
else--'

  `Or else what?' said Alice, for the Knight had made a sudden pause.

  `Or else it doesn't, you know.  The name of the song is called
"HADDOCKS' EYES."'

  `Oh, that's the name of the song, is it?' Alice said, trying to feel
interested.

  `No, you don't understand,' the Knight said, looking a little vexed.
`That's what the name is CALLED.  The name really IS "THE AGED AGED
MAN."'

  `Then I ought to have said "That's what the SONG is called"?'  Alice
corrected herself.

  `No, you oughtn't: that's quite another thing!  The SONG is called
"WAYS AND MEANS": but that's only what it's CALLED, you know!'

  `Well, what IS the song, then?' said Alice, who was by this time
completely bewildered.

  `I was coming to that,' the Knight said.  `The song really IS
"A-SITTING ON A GATE": and the tune's my own invention.'

Same problem in RL.  I submit my time sheet to my client but it has a mistake
on it, which e points out.  I scratch out the mistake, initial it and give it
back to em.  It's not until that body of text is given legal significance that
I have to worry about preventing changes to it.  That happens when the body of
text takes on some other property - it's put in a particular location, or it's
officially recorded in some other medium.

The problem of some unscrupulous Officer changing the document before or after
it has taken on legal significance in Agora is the same whether you keep the
Nomic Entity distinction or not.  Although it may be true that some non-Nomic
properties might be more easily altered (illegally) than Steve suggests, if you
don't take advantage of the built in redundancy of the e-mail system.

Fair enough.  But I would point out that argument "d" doesn't create any new
loopholes, it merely takes advantage of one that already exists.  As long as
R1586 exists in its current form, the risk of Players using that loophole is
the same whether you use "d" to spoil MMM or not.

Perhaps "...came into being due solely to the Rules..." would be better in
that case. 
<<

But that's a difference that came up quite often now: for example, it
was argued that the MMM currencies were _created_ not just according
to the rules (because Morendil's actions, and some decisions of eir,
like naming the new currency, were required, too), but that they
continued to exist only due to the rules (because as soon as the
relevant rules are repealed, they cease to exist).

I think for a proper definition of NEs (if we still need the concept at
all) we should not put so much emphasis on the metaphysical or
ontological aspect of NEs, but on the practical purpose of this
definition. NEs are defined so they can be protected against unwanted
manipulations. So they should somehow be defined as such: entities
which play a role in Agora and which should be protected from
unregulated manipulations.

InterNomic takes a much more direct approach to that:

>>
Rule 323/0 (Mutable)

It is forbidden to alter the essentials of the game state except as is
explicitly or implicitly permitted by a rule or a set of rules. The
essentials of the game state consist of the rules themselves, the
scores of the member nomics, the proposals, the votes cast on
proposals, the statements for judgement and verdicts returned upon
them, and anything else so designated by some rule. No other things
are included in the essentials of the game state.  
<<

Maybe not so elegant, and less flexible in case some of these
"essentials" are abolished or substantially changed, but the purpose
of the rule becomes much clearer.

Content-Type: text
Content-Length: 3757
Status: N

In the whole discussion around Steve's Metaphysical Manifesto I am
beginning to think that the real issue (at least the issue relevant to
Agora) is not so much one of meta_physics_ (in which way do Agora
related entities exist?) but one of meta_rules_, mostly concerned with
attempts to cheat.

I am quite willing to follow Steve's argument and accept that Agora
entities are not more virtual or Platonic than the items used to
reperesent money in ftf games of Poker or Monopoly.

But what we are discussing a lot in this context is what constitutes
cheating or stealing, and in particular, successful cheating or
stealing. 

Various differences between an eMail and a ftf game have been
mentioned: game complexity, tokens that can be held in hand or must be
chased through a huge number of data files all over the world etc.

But more important is the difference in metarules (if there is one,
that is). In ftf games it is usually considered fair (metarule) not to
steal game money from a player while e is absent. The same normally
holds for other manipulations of eir game pieces, records etc; for
accessing hidden information (like face down cards) of the absent
player; present players discussing strategy or making secret plans
against the absent player etc. A similar example are metarules that
govern the behavior of players who are also bankkeepers or have other
functions (don't mix your own money and the bank's, etc).

What are the analogous metarules in Agora? And what is more
interesting: isn't the dividing line between ordinary rules listed
explicitly in the rules and the unspoken metarules drawn differently
in family board games and in eMail games such as Agora? (Someone also
mentioned that such "metarules" are explicit in "serious" tournament
card games like bridge). For example all the rekordkeeping for
currencies is much more explicitly regulated in Agora than in
Monopoly.

There are several reasons for these different approaches to metarules:

- deliberate attempts to cheat are more difficult to detect in an
eMail game than ftf, especially when attempted by recordkeepors and
the like. Some have argued against this, but:

- same goes for unintentional mistakes (lost mails, wrong rule
interpretations...) - and even that happens often enough!

- technical differences in recordkeeping (physical tokens you can hold
in your hand vs electronically stored information) - hence the
importance of naming entities properly. A naming conflict as in MMM
would not be a problem in ftf games, you could just point to the
different tokens and say "this here thingy" - or you could see that
two players are giving different names to the same thing. Not so easy
in an eMail game where (written) language is the only means of
communication and recordkeeping.

- interest of the players: in family board games (usually) noone is
interested in exploring potential ways to cheat successfully, abuse
loopholes in the rules etc. And if someone does and is caught that is
considered a breach of some metarules and punished outside of the game
("I'm not going to play with you anymore !") In Agora, doing the same
thing is part of the fun, and punished (I hope :) only within the
game, for example via the Kudo system - Morendil lost a lot of these
recently, didn't he? But he still made a very valid contribution to
the game and the general enjoyment of it all.

Morale: I think that some of our discussions, especially in the conceptual
difficulties raised by MMM, would be easier to phrase in terms of game
design, meta rules etc and the concepts behind them - instead of
metaphysical or philosophical discussions that do not lead to more
clarity (sorry if some scientists' prejudice comes through here, I'll
stop rambling 

NOW.)

As Chuck mentioned, though, the "name" method already has Judicial
Precedent. While it may be unpleasant (I'm not too sure of it, myself) it's
a perfectly acceptable way to handle the issue.

I usually hear it with "flies" and "bazookas."

Because then it's not the same body of text, it's a similar yet different
one. If you submit a body of text, and submit it, that cements its
existence, WRT Agora, in that form. If the player you send it to changes
it, then posts the new version to the PF as your document, it's not the
same body of text -- it's a similar one, but not the same. The only way the
body of text gains Nomic Properties is for you to submit it in a specific
manner, and since the text e posts is not the text you submitted, it does
not have those Nomic Properties.

The only way you can change the contents of a body of text and have it
retain the Nomic Properties it has is if the Rules specifically let you --
otherwise, you're just creating a new body of text, without such
Properties. Of course, this allows you to change the document as much as
you want before it gains any Nomic Properties.

I have an idea for an "improvement" to the Virus... to make it more like a

Just a comment, on the cheating issue...

In the game Illuminati (an excellent game from Steve Jackson Games),
there is a rule that states that "Cheating is permitted, as long as
you can get away with it."

_Through_the_Looking_Glass_, Chapter VIII "It's My Own Invention"

  "The name of the song is called `Haddock's eyes'."

  "Oh, that's the name of the song, is it?" Alice said, trying to feel
   interested.

  "No, you don't understand." the Knight said, looking a little vexed.
  "That's what the name of the song is _called_. The name real _is_ 
   'The Aged Aged Man'."

  "Then I ought to have said `That's what the _song_ is called'?" Alice
   corrected herself.

  "No, you oughtn't: that's quite another thing! The _song_ is called
   `Ways and Means': but that's only what it is _called_, you know!"

  "Well, what _is_ the song, then?" said Alice, who was by this time
   completely bewildered.

  "I was coming to that." the Knight said. "The song really _is_ `A-sitting
   On A Gate': and the tune's my own invention."

Of course, as Roger Holmes points out, the Knight was wrong, the song is 
_not_ really `A-sitting On A Gate' at all. This is just other name. He
should really have said "the song is..." and then burst into the song itself.
(Which is, needless to say, very, very beautiful. Everybody that hears
 it - either it brings teats into their eyes, or else...)
