Am I missing something, or is it completely up to the Chancellor how (and
whether) to give away Plots and Structures belonging to the Bank?

Protoproposal Chaos22 [rev. 12]

The Omnibus Reform Act of 1998

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1503 be amended to read:

      Any entity who performs an action defined by the Rules to be a
      Crime, or fails to perform an action where such failure is
      defined by the Rules to be a Crime, shall be subject to whatever
      penalty the Rules prescribe for that Crime upon the execution of
      a Sentencing Order executed consequent to a judicial finding
      that e did in fact commit that Crime.

      Any entity who performs an action defined by the Rules to be an
      Infraction, or fails to perform an action where such failure is
      defined by the Rules to be an Infraction, shall be subject to
      whatever penalty the Rules prescribe for that Infraction upon a
      Notice of Infraction stating that e committed that Infraction.

      A Notice of Infraction stating that an entity has committed a
      specific Infraction consists of a report by a Player authorized
      to report instances of that specific Infraction that it is eir
      informed belief that the specified entity has committed the
      specified Infraction.  A Notice of Infraction shall also specify
      the penalty to be imposed for that Infraction.

      No action is a Crime or an Infraction unless defined as such by
      the Rules.  If the Rules define an act to be a Crime or an
      Infraction, but fail to prescribe a penalty for that act, then
      there is no penalty for that act.  If the Rules define an act to
      be an Infraction, but fail to authorize any Player or Players to
      report instances of that Infraction, then that Infraction cannot
      be reported.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1504 be amended to read:

      The imposition of penalties for the commission of a Crime shall
      be by Sentencing Order(s).  Upon a judicial finding that an
      entity has committed a Crime, the Judge so finding shall execute
      Sentencing Orders sufficient to implement the penalty required
      by the Rules for that Crime.

      The imposition of penalties for the commission of an Infraction
      shall be by the execution of a Notice of Infraction.  The Player
      executing the Notice of Infraction shall, at the time e does so,
      also execute Orders sufficient to implement the penalty required
      by the Rules for that Infraction.

      The punishment for a Crime or Infraction shall be whatever was
      specified by the Rules at the time the action so designated as a
      Crime or an Infraction was committed, even if the Rule or Rules
      which specified the punishment, or which designated the action
      as a Crime or Infraction, have since been amended or repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1652 be amended to read:

      No entity shall be subject to penalties more than once for a
      single instance of a particular Crime or Infraction, any other
      Rule notwithstanding.

      Any CFJ whose Statement alleges that an entity has, through
      action or inaction, committed a Crime shall be dismissed if
      there is a prior CFJ, the statement of which alleges that the
      same entity has, through the same action or inaction, committed
      the same Crime, and which was itself not dismissed.

      This Rule in no way bars the imposition of multiple penalties
      for the same act (or failure to act) if such action (or
      inaction) constitutes multiple Crimes, multiple Infractions, or
      any combination thereof.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      A penalty denying Voting Privileges to an entity for a period of
      time shall be imposed by ordering the Assessor to deny Voting
      Privilege to the named Voting Entity for that period of time.
      The denial of Voting Privilege begins with the beginning of the
      first full Nomic Week after the Order takes effect, and
      continues for the period specified.
 
      While the Assessor is ordered to deny Voting Privilege to a
      Voting Entity, that Voting Entity shall be entitled to cast no
      Votes on any Proposal, any other Rule to the contrary
      notwithstanding.

|     Any period of time during which an Order denying Voting
|     Privilege is without effect does not count toward the period of
|     denial.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1509 be amended to read:

      Upon a judicial finding that a Player has failed to perform a
      duty required of em by the Rules, the Judge so finding shall
      execute an Order requiring that Player to perform that duty as
      soon as possible.

      If the duty in question arises because the Player in question
      holds a specific Office or other position of official
      responsibility, the Order shall bind that Office or position.
      If the Player holding that Office fails to perform the duty in
      question as ordered, the Judge shall Order that that Player be
      removed from Office or position.

      If the duty in question arises for a reason not related to the
      Player in question holding a specific Office or official
      position, and that Player fails to perform the duty as ordered,
      the Judge shall amend the Order to require the Speaker to
      perform that duty instead.

      The refusal of the Speaker to perform a duty when ordered to do
      so by a Judge according to this Rule constitutes being an
      Impossible Speaker, as defined elsewhere.

      The failure of a Player to perform a duty required of em by
      virtue of being a Judge is not subject to review by the
      procedures established in this Rule.  Any CFJ alleging that a
      Judge has failed to perform a duty of a judicial nature shall be
      dismissed.

      A CFJ alleging that the Clerk of the Courts has failed to
      perform a duty of eir Office may, at the Caller's option, be
      filed with the Justiciar, who shall then perform all the duties
      of the Clerk of the Courts with respect to that CFJ.

| Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      An Order is a command, executed by a Player and directed to some
      entity requiring that entity to perform exactly one action, or
      to refrain from performing one or more actions.  An Order may be
      directed to the holder of an Office or other official position
      in eir capacity as that Office or other official position, and
      in this case if the Office or position changes hands before the
      Order is satisfied, the duty to abide by the Order automatically
      attaches to the new holder of that Office or position.  An
      Order, the purpose of which is to affect the operation of a
      prior Order, is as valid as any other Order, and is said to be
      directed at the prior Order it affects.

| Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:
| 
|     An Order which commands the performance of an action may specify
|     when that action is to be performed; if no specification is
|     given, or if the specification given would require the
|     performance of the action at a time when the Order is without
|     effect, the Order shall be taken to require the performance of
|     the action as soon as possible after the Order takes effect.
|     
|     This Rule defers to any Rule which establishes regulations
|     relating to the performance of duties required by various sorts
|     of Orders.
| 
| Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:
| 
      There are four classes of Order: Administrative, Judicial,
|     Appellate, and Private.  
| 
|     A Judicial Order is an Order executed by a Player while acting
|     as a Judge.
| 
|     An Appellate Order is an Order executed by a Board of Appeals.
| 
|     An Administrative Order is an Order executed by the holder of an
|     Office or other official position (such as the Speaker or the
|     Recordkeepor of a Currency) other than that of a Judge or
|     Justice, in the course of performing the duties of that Office
|     or position.
| 
|     A Private Order is any other sort of Order.
| 
| Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      All Orders executed in the manner prescribed by the Rules for
      their class and type are presumed valid and enforceable until
|     proven otherwise by CFJ.  
| 
|     In order to be proven valid by CFJ, the Rules must permit the
|     Player who executed the Order in question to execute such an
|     Order, that the execution of the Order must have been required
|     by or permitted in the circumstances which existed at the time
|     it was executed, and that the Order has not been rendered
|     invalid by the operation of any other Rule.
| 
|     Furthermore, no Order may act to prevent or hinder its own
|     appeal in any way, and any portion of an Order which has this
|     effect is void and without force.

| Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:
| 
|     In addition, since Appellate Orders cannot be appealed,
      Appellate Orders are valid only if addressed to:
        a) The Clerk of the Courts in eir Official capacity;
        b) an Order issued by the Clerk of the Courts in eir Official
           Capacity; 
        c) The Judge of the CFJ which that Board of Appeals was
           convened to consider, or any Order issued by that Judge in
           that particular CFJ; or
        d) any combination of the above.
|     All other Appellate Orders are presumptively invalid.  
| 
|     This Rule takes precedence over all Rules pertaining to the
|     validity of Appellate Orders.
| 
| Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      Knowingly and willfully executing invalid Orders constitutes the
      Class B Crime of Abuse of Authority.

| Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:
| 
      A Player who performs as required by an Order which is later
      found to be invalid is not liable for eir actions; but other
|     Rules may establish procedures for correcting or remedying
      such circumstances when they occur.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

|     Any Order may always be amended, stayed, or vacated by the
|     Player (or, in the case of Appellate Orders, Board of Appeal)
|     who executed it.  Certain classes of Orders may be amended,
|     stayed, or vacated in other circumstances as well, when the
|     Rules so allow.  In all cases, this is done by an Order to
      Amend, Stay, or Vacate, respectively, the original Order.
      Otherwise, an Order shall not be amended, stayed, vacated, or
      otherwise changed once executed.

| Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:
| 
      The effect of amending an Order is to cause it to be effective
      in its amended form.  The prior form of the Order ceases to have
      effect upon the amendment, and the new form has effect as if it
      had been originally executed in that form at the moment the
      amendment becomes effective.  Vacating an Order to Amend has the
|     same effect as would an Order to Amend reinstating the previous
|     form of the Order.
| 
| Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      The effect of staying an Order is to temporarily deny the stayed
      Order from having any effect.  A stay may be ordered for a fixed
      time, in which case the stay expires at the time specified; or
      for an indefinite time, in which case the stay will not expire.
      If no specification is made in the Order to Stay, the stay shall
      be indefinite.  When the stay expires or is vacated, the
      previously stayed order again has effect as if it had been
      originally executed at the moment the stay ceases to be
      effective.  However, if the stayed Order is vacated while
      stayed, it does not regain effect when the stay expires or is
      lifted.

| Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:
| 
      The effect of vacating an Order is to permanently deny the
      vacated Order from having any effect.  Vacating an Order to
      Vacate reinstates the ability of the vacated Order to have
      effect, as of the moment the Order to Vacate is itself vacated.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:
      
      Judicial Orders are executed by being sent to the Clerk of the
      Courts, but do not take effect until their publication by the
      Clerk of the Courts.  The Clerk of the Courts shall publish each
      Judicial Order as soon as possible after receiving it from the
      Judge who executed it.

      Judicial Orders are subject to appeal to a Board of Appeal by a
      Call for Appeal.  The Board of Appeal shall, upon finding that a
      Judicial Order is improperly or invalidly executed, order that
      that Order be amended or vacated, as it deems appropriate.  When
      the Clerk of the Courts receives a properly executed Call for
      Appeal of a Judicial Order, the Clerk of the Courts shall stay
      the Order under appeal.  If the Board of Appeals affirms the
      validity of the original Order, it shall then vacate this stay.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      Appellate Orders are executed by being sent to the Clerk of the
      Courts by the Lead Justice of a Board of Appeals, but do not
      take effect until their publication by the Clerk of the Courts.
      The Lead Justice shall certify in eir submission to the Clerk of
      the Courts that the Order is executed by the concurrence of the
      majority of the Justices comprising that Board of Appeals;
      failure to do so deprives the Order of effect.  The Clerk of the
      Courts shall publish each Appellate Order as soon as possible
      after receiving it from the Board of Appeal which executed it.

      Appellate Orders are not subject to appeal except by Motion to
      Reconsider.  However, upon a judicial finding that the
      certification required by this Rule was falsely provided, the
      Justiciar shall vacate the Order which was accompanied by that
      false certification.

      The Lead Justice of a Board of Appeals is the Justiciar, if e is
      serving on that Board, or the Player who serves in the place of
      the Justiciar otherwise.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      Administrative Orders are executed by being published in the
      Public Forum, and take effect upon publication.

      Private Orders are executed by submitting them directly to the
      Player to be commanded, and take effect upon submission.

      Both Administrative and Private Orders are subject to appeal by
      a CFJ, the statement of which Statement alleges that the Order
      is improperly or invalidly executed.  Upon a judicial finding
      that an Administrative or Private Order was improperly or
      invalidly executed, the Judge so finding shall vacate that
      Order.  When the Clerk of the Courts receives a properly
      executed Call for Judgement, the statement of which alleges that
      an Administrative or Private Order was improperly or invalidly
      executed, the Clerk of the Courts shall stay the Order in
      dispute.  If the Judge affirms the validity of the original
      Order, e shall then vacate this stay.  

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1736 be repealed.  [Rule 1736 is
redundant; a Judge's Order to pay Currency is a Payment Order in its
own right.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1737 be repealed.  [Rule 1737 is
redundant; Payment Orders are Orders subject to appeal according to
the processes detailed above and can be vacated directly according to
those procedures.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1599 be amended to read:

      Whenever a Rule requires a Player to execute a Payment Order, e
      shall do so within seven days of when the requirement arises.

[Rule 1599 is almost wholly redundant; the failure to execute a
Payment Order falls within the scope of the amended Rule 1509.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1598 be amended to read:

      A Transfer Order is an Order requiring the Recordkeepor of a
      Currency to note the transfer of units of that Currency from one
      entity to another.  A valid Transfer Order specifies exactly one
      source entity, exactly one destination entity, exactly one
      Currency, and a number of units of that Currency which is a
      positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ.

      A Recordkeepor is required to abide by all valid Transfer Orders
      submitted by the Executor of the owner of the units of Currency
      to be transferred (or, with respect to any entity which lacks an
      Executor, by any other person empowered by the Rules to execute
      Transfer Orders on the behalf of such entities), except for
      those transfers which would result in an entity possessing a
      negative quantity of Currency.  Transfers shall be noted on the
      Recordkeepor's records in the order in which they are received
      by the Recordkeepor.

      If a Recordkeepor notes a transfer pursuant to a Transfer Order
      which is subsequently vacated, e shall correct eir records as
      soon as possible after the Transfer Order is vacated by noting a
      transfer which is the reverse of the transfer originally noted.
      However, if such a reversing transfer would result in an entity
      possessing a negative quantity of units of Currency, e shall
      instead execute a Payment Order requiring a Transfer Order that
      would have the same effect as the reversing transfer.

      The effect of noting a transfer on the records of the
      Recordkeepor is to remove the specified number of units of
      Currency from the holdings of the source entity and to add the
      specified number of units of Currency to the holdings of the
      destination entity.

      Each Recordkeepor shall maintain a record of all Transfer Orders
      submitted which specify the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor, for at least four weeks after their submission,
      and a complete record of all transfers noted upon eir records
      for at least four weeks.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1746 be repealed.  [Rule 1746 is
redundant; a CFJ alleging that a Transfer Order is illegal would, if
found true, result in the vacation of that Transfer Order, which would
then trigger a reversing transfer or Payment Order under the revised
Rule 1598, above.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1730 be amended to read:

      The Recordkeepor of a Currency may, at eir discretion, elect to
      refuse any Transfer Order which requires em to note a transfer
      at any time other than as soon as possible after the Order
      itself became effective.  The Recordkeepor's election to refuse
      an Transfer Order in this fashion renders invalid that Order
      provided that the Recordkeepor sends a message to the Player who
      executed the Order informing him of eir election, within seven
      days of the receipt of that Order.

      This Rule does not apply to Transfer Orders which are required
      by the Rules to be executed with a specification that the
      transfer be noted at a time other than as soon as possible after
      they become effective.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1731 be repealed.  [Implicit
Transfer Orders are a pain, and exist only to support Voting.  The
conversion to paying for Votes after the fact eliminates the need for
this.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1596 be amended to read:

      A Payment Order is an Order requiring an entity (the payor) to
      submit a Transfer Order transferring units of a Currency from
      itself to some other entity (the payee).  A Payment Order
      specifies exactly one source entity, exactly one destination
      entity, exactly one Currency, and a number of units of that
      Currency which is a positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ.

      A Payment Order is only valid if a copy has been filed with the
      Recordkeepor of the Currency specified in it, and takes effect
      no sooner than the time of such filing.  (Publishing the Payment
      Order in the Public Forum is sufficient to meet this
      requirement.)

      Each Recordkeepor shall maintain a record of all Payment Orders
      filed with em which specify the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor.  This record shall also indicate, for each Order,
      if that Order has been satisfied, vacated, or both.  However,
      the Recordkeepor need only maintain records of satisfied or
      vacated Orders for four weeks after they have been satisfied or
      vacated.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1733 be repealed.  [The automatic
stay of Orders under CFJ renders Rule 1733 effectively redundant.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1734 be amended to read:

      When a satisfied Payment Order is vacated, the Recordkeepor of
      the Currency named in that Payment Order shall execute a new
      Payment Order identical to the vacated Payment Order, but with
      the payor and payee interchanged.

      If the Order vacating the original Payment Order is subsequently
      stayed or vacated, then the Recordkeepor shall stay or vacate
      the reversing Order required by this Rule.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1713 be amended to read:

      An Overdue Payment Order is a Payment Order which is presently
      effective, has been effective for more than seven days, and has
      not been satisfied.

      The Executor of an entity for which, at the beginning of a given
      Nomic week, there is at least one Overdue Payment Order naming
      it as Payor commits the Infraction of Persistent Indebtedness at
      the beginning of that Week.  If an entity has more than one
      Overdue Payment Order naming it as payor, its Executor commits
      as many such Infractions are there are different Currencies
      named in all these Overdue Payment Orders.

      The Recordkeepor of each Currency is authorized to report this
      Infraction with respect to the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor.  This Infraction carries a penalty of one Blot.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1442 be amended to read:

      The casting of any votes may only be achieved by the spending of
      VTs, as specified below.

      A Voting Entity Votes upon a Proposal when e, during the Voting
      Period of that Proposal, informs the Assessor of the Vote (or
      Votes) e is casting upon that Proposal.

      A Voting Entity may specify that e casts no Votes on a Proposal,
      and doing so cancels any previously Votes cast on that Proposal
      (if done during the Voting Period of that Proposal).

      At the end of the Voting Period of a given Proposal, the
      Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity a number of VTs equal to
      the cost of the Votes cast on that Proposal by that entity.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      An entity for which, at the beginning of a given Nomic week,
      there is at least one Overdue Payment Order naming it as Payor
      which was executed originally for the purpose of paying for
      Voting upon Proposals commits the Infraction of Debt Voting.
      This Infraction shall be reported by the Recordkeepor for Voting
      Tokens, and shall bear the penalty of the denial of Voting
      Privileges for a period of two weeks.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1696 be amended, by replacing the
characters "Assessor" with "Banker" throughout, and by inserting the
following paragraph at the beginning of the Rule:

      There shall exist the Office of Banker.  The Banker shall
      receive a weekly salary equal to 1.5 times the Basic Officer
      Salary.

Be it further resolved, that Rules 663, 1571, and 1573 be repealed.
[Judicial Orders cover everything that Injunctions cover.]

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      An Order is satisfied when the action which it requires to be
      performed is performed by the entity it requires to perform it.
      (Only Orders which require an entity to perform an action can be
      satisfied.)  Any entity who is required by an Order to perform
      an act who fails to perform the required action prior to the
      time specified in the Order commits the Crime of Contempt by
      Inaction, a Class C Crime.

      Except when otherwise specified, a single action can result in
      the satisifaction of at most one Order.  If an action would
      satisfy more than one Order, and no other specification is made,
      the Action satisfies the oldest Order which it would satisfy.

      This Rule shall have no application with respect to any Order
      which has been adjudicated to be invalid, and the invalidity of
      the Order is a complete defense to a Criminal accusation made
      under this Rule.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      Any entity who, while required by an Order to refrain from
      performing an action, performs the proscribed action while the
      Order is in effect commits the Crime of Contempt by Action, a
      Class C Crime.

      This Rule shall have no application with respect to any Order
      which has been adjudicated to be invalid, and the invalidity of
      the Order is a complete defense to a Criminal accusation made
      under this Rule.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1551 be amended, by replacing
"Injunction" with "Order".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 789 be amended to read:

      The Judge of any CFJ, the Statement of which alleges that a Rule
      should be interpreted in a certain way, which is judged TRUE,
      may, at eir discretion, issue an Order requiring the Rulekeepor
      to annotate the Rule in question with the Statement of that CFJ.
      Such an annotation, while it exists, shall guide application of
      that Rule.  

      The Rulekeepor may remove such an annotation only if that Rule
      is repealed, or when required to do so by a valid Order.
      Annotations to a Rule may not be modified in any way except as
      specified in this Rule.

      If a Player believes that an annotation is no longer pertinent,
      e may file, in the original CFJ from which the Order of
      Annotation arises, a Motion to Vacate the Order of Annotation.
      If such a Motion is granted, the Judge granting it shall Order
      the original Order Vacated and shall Order the Rulekeepor to
      remove the annotation in question.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1500 be amended to read:

      The Judge of any CFJ, the Statement of which alleges that an SLC
      should be interpreted in a certain way, which is judged TRUE,
      may, at eir discretion, issue an Order requiring the Maintainer
      of that SLC to annotate the SLC in question with the Statement
      of that CFJ.  Such an annotation, while it exists, shall guide
      application of that SLC.  

      The Maintainer of that SLC may remove such an annotation only
      when the SLC ceases to exist, or when required to do so by a
      valid Order.  Annotations to an SLC may not be modified in any
      way except as specified in this Rule.

      If a Player believes that an annotation is no longer pertinent,
      e may file, in the original CFJ from which the Order of
      Annotation arises, a Motion to Vacate the Order of Annotation.
      If such a Motion is granted, the Judge granting it shall Order
      the original Order Vacated and shall Order the Maintainer of
      that SLC to remove the annotation in question.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1742 be amended by replacing the
word "Injunctions" with "Orders".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 908 be amended to read:

      Upon a judicial finding that a Player (herein called the Ninny)
      has acted or has failed to act in such a way as to be in
      violation of one or more Rules, the Judge so finding shall Order
      that Player to submit, within 72 hours, a Formal Apology.
      However, when the action (or failure to act) is subject to
      penalties by virtue of being defined to be a Crime or an
      Infraction, the Order is optional and may be issued at the
      Judge's discretion.

      A Formal Apology shall consist of a letter of at least 200
      words, to be published by the Ninny in the Public Forum,
      explaining the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
      for self-improvement.

      The Judge issuing such an Order may, at eir discretion, include
      in eir Order a list of up to ten Prescribed Words (to be chosen
      by the Judge) which must be included in the Formal Apology.  If
      the Judge elects to include Prescribed Words, all of the Words
      required must appear within the Formal Apology. 

      The failure to abide by an Order of a sort specified by this
      Rule is an Infraction carrying a penalty of 3 Blots, to be
      reported by the Judge who issued the original Order. 

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1681 be amended, by replacing
"Injunction" with "Order".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1564 be amended to read:

      The Judgement entered in any CFJ by its Judge, the grant or
      denial of any Judicial Motion, and the execution of any Judicial
      Order are all subject to review on appeal to a Board of Appeal.
      
      In all cases, the insistence of any three Players, posted in the
      Public Forum, is sufficient to initiate the appeal of a
      particular matter.  In the case of the appeal of a Judicial
      Order, the insistence of any Player bound by the Order is
      sufficient.  In the case of a Judgement which convicts a Player
      of a Crime, the insistence of the convicted Player is
      sufficient.

      In each cases before a Board of Appeal, it shall collectively
      decide whether to affirm or to reverse the matter under appeal,
      and shall execute whatever Appellate Orders are necessary to
      enforce its determination.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1695 be amended to read:

      In the appeal of a Judicial Order, the Board shall consider
      whether the Order in question was both legally made and
      appropriate for the situation.

      If the Board finds that the Order was made legally, and was
      appropriate for the situation, it shall affirm the Order.  If an
      Order staying the execution of the appealed Order was entered,
      it shall vacate this stay.

      If the Board finds that the Order was made illegally, or that it
      was inappropriate for the situation, it shall vacate the
      original Order.  Should the Board further find that the Order
      was made without reasonable justification or for a clearly
      improper purpose, it shall (at its discretion) impose a penalty
      of 2 Blots upon the Judge who made the original Order.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1725 be repealed.  [If a Player
feels that a Judge has omitted an Order, e may file a Motion
requesting that that Order be issued, and may appeal the refusal of
that Motion, if refused.]

(Not an actual decision. Comments welcomed.)

>   "Harlequin did not win the Game upon the conclusion of the voting
>    period of Proposal 3640."

The Caller's argument in this CFJ focused on two distinct lines of
reasoning.

The first involves Judicial precedent, and essentially argues that to
be consistent with the decision on CFJ 1078, where it was found that
the act of casting a FA (FOR and AGAINST) vote on Proposal 3640, then
later retracting both Votes, constituted a violation of Rule 1729,
it must be concluded that the same act constitutes a condition
preventing the clause in Rule 1729 stating "should it occur [...]
that no one Votes FOR it, the Proposer shall Win".

The second involves causal relationships, and essentially argues that
that same clause, which in full reads "should it occur (due to greed
or sin) that no one Votes FOR it, the Proposer shall Win", imposes
two distinct conditions which must be satisifed; one on the Voting
patterns on such a Proposal, and the second on the causes leading to
such particular Voting patterns.

The Judge's decision in 1081 did not consider the second line of
argument. In line with the doctrine of avoidance which has recently
come to the fore in Appellate decisions, this leads this Justice to
the following policy : if the first line of argument is sufficient to
uphold the Judge's decision, the Judgement shall be confirmed. If it
is not, the Judgement shall be set aside and the CFJ shall be
reassigned, with a recommendation that the new Judge examine both
lines of argument. 

We now turn to the crucial issue, i.e. whether the Judgement in CFJ
1078 should be interpreted to have bearing on the Statement of CFJ
1081, and whether the implications of that Judgement are such that
it is sufficient to imply the truth of the Statement in 1081.

This Justice must first observe that the Rules make an implicit
distinction between the act of casting a Vote, which is referred to
as "Voting", and the resultant fact of a Player having voted in a
certain manner at the end of a given Voting Period, which is also
referred to as "Voting".

This was expressed by Judge Blob in eir decision in 1078, thusly :

   I argue that the Rules can distinguish between a case in which a
   Player first votes and then retracts his vote, and a case in which a
   Player does not vote at all.

This is also evident in the notion of "retracting" Votes. If a
Player, to whom we'll assume, for simplicity, the Rules do not grant
any extended Voting rights, casts two Votes on a given Proposal, then
later retracts these Votes, then later casts, once more, two Votes
on that same Proposal, this is deemed not to exceed the Voting rights
granted by Rule 209 ("Each Voting Entity has two votes on a Proposal,
unless another Rule says otherwise"), nor will the final tally of
Votes on that Proposal show more than two Votes from this Player.
However, the act of casting a Vote has been performed four times in
such an instance.

>From the foregoing, we can only conclude, regarding the decision in
1078, that Rule 1729's prohibition on Voting "in public" applies to
the act of Voting, rather than to the fact of a Player having Voted 
in a certain manner when a Voting Period has ended.

Judge Time Agent therefore argues that the Win condition defined by
Rule 1729 refers to the first meaning of "Vote". This Justice finds 
the argument without merit, as the construction "no one Votes FOR it" 
may equally well refer to the second meaning, and as a matter of 
personal opinion seems better interpreted that way.

The Judgement is therefore set aside, and the CFJ shall be 
reassigned, and it is recommended that the new Judge consider the 
totality of the Caller's arguments in eir decision.

> ======================================================================
> Injunction by Judge Time Agent:
> 
>       I hereby retract Harlequin's win.  Harlequin's
>       Champion's Reward is hereby revoked, and any benefits
>       thereof are no longer valid.  The Registrar must vacate

Rule 1695 calls for this Board to "consider the legality and
appropriateness of the Injunction".

The first issue at hand is to determine what Injunction or
Injunctions were issued in the above. Rule 663 states that an
Injunction is an order requiring one or more Players to perform, or
refrain from performing, one or more actions. 

The initial portion of Time Agent's statements labelled as an
Injunction, "I hereby retract Harlequin's win.  Harlequin's
Champion's Reward is hereby revoked, and any benefits thereof are no
longer valid" does not explicitly or explicitly name a Player or
Players, nor any action or actions.

The clause "The Registrar must vacate the 10 VT PO due to this false
win" on the other hand, clearly identifies one Player, and an action 
that Player is ordered to perform. This is therefore clearly one 
Injunction.

The last sentence of Time Agent's statement, "Any other benefit or
reward that is not specifically named herein that is a direct result
of said false win must also be removed/deleted/returned" might 
conceivably be interpreted as an Injunction, applying to any Players 
having granted a reward as a result of Harlequin's putative Win or 
having benefited from such, and requiring of such Players to take 
appropriate steps to reverse the effects of such rewards.

This Justice therefore identifies two distinct Injunctions in Time 
Agent's Judgement.

Of the first Injunction, that requiring the Registrar to vacate a PO 
for 10 VTs, this Justice finds that it facially satisfies the 
following clauses of Rule 663 :
 i) it specifies the Player to whom it applies
 ii) it specifies the action that Player is required to perform
 iii) it was attached to a legal Judgement at the time of delivery

Clauses iv) and v) leaves more room for interpretation. Rule 1737
states that the Rules "may require, in certain cases", an Injunction
such as issued by Time Agent. No Rule did impose such a requirement
in the present instance, but on the other hand this does not
necessarily lead to the conclusion that an Injunction of the sort
defined in Rule 1737 may not be issued "in a manner consistent with
the Rules" when no requirement to do so exists. 

There is, however, some Judicial precedent as to the legality of
such an Injunction. I refer to the Appellate decision in the matter 
of the Injunctions attached to CFJ 1045, where two out of three 
Justices delivered an opinion on the matter.

>From the CotC's decision :

   Now for these Injunction's legality. I think these Injunctions fall
   short of the fourth point in Rule 663. In my opinion Rule 1736 only
   defines Injunctions being the execution of a Payment Order which are
   required by the Rules. As Morendil was not required by the Rules to do
   so, his Injunctions are not of this type. They are clearly not of any
   other type defined by the Rules, so they do not comply with the
   prerequisites in Rule 663, and thus are not legally made.

>From the Justiciar's decision :

         The Rules may require, in certain cases, that a Judge issue an
         Injunction ordering the execution of a Payment Order.

   But I do not see how to get from this to saying that a Judge may issue
   PO's in all cases.  "Certain cases" seems to need specifying by the
   Rules. Absent this, it seems impossible for the Judge to establish
   that this is one of the "certain cases" where he can issue a legal
   injunction.

The Injunctions considered by the Justices in the abovementioned
Board of Appeals were of the type defined in Rule 1736, rather than
Rule 1737 as in the present case, but the wording of the relevant
provision is clearly identical, and thus we may proceed by analogy.

This Injunction shall therefore be set aside as not legally made.

Of the second Injunction, that requiring a much broader class of
actions from a much broader set of Players, this Justice finds that
it facially violates clause iv) of Rule 663. No Rule currently
defines a type Injunction which could cover the broad requirements
made by this second order. This Injunction shall therefore be set
aside as not legally made.

It shall however be noted that the decisions of the same Justices make
a strong case that both of Time Agent's Injunctions, irrespective of
their legality, were "appropriate" in the sense required by Rule 663.

>From the CotC's decision :

   However, Rule 1695 asks the Board of Appeals to not only check
   legality, but also appropriateness of the Injunction. And this is
   easy - there is no reasonable connection between the CFJ and the
   Injunctions, and thus issuing these Injunctions with this CFJ's
   Judgement must be regarded inappropriate, and the Injunctions (I will
   not at this place go into the more difficult issue of their number)
   must be set aside. 

The Speaker's decision reiterated this criterion.

The Justiciar's decision stated :

   It is clear that the Injunctions were all inappropriate for the
   situation of the CFJ.  "Appropriate for the situation," in the clear
   sense of the Rule, would mean that the injunction was a natural and
   expected result of the Statement being found TRUE.

Judging by the above two criteria - first, that there should exist a 
reasonable connection between the CFJ and the Injunction, and second, 
that the Injunction should be a natural and expected result of the 
Statement being found TRUE, it seems to this Justice that, had the 
Injunctions been legally made, they would have been appropriate as 
well.
