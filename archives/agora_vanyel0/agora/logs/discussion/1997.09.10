It's worth nothing that Austin's command theory of the nature of law
has been comprehensively criticized by Hart (in _The Concept of Law_ OUP
1961), and as a result has fallen out of favour.

I believe that there is a prior Judgement which eliminates this
possibility. I seem to recall delivering a Judgement on the legality
of some or other Injunction to Interpret a Rule which turned on just
this point, and finding that we could not consider such a reference
as an implicit list of Relevant Rules. I'll see if I can find the
Judgement.

R789 says that a CFJ on Rule interpretation must be accompanied a
list of Relevant Rules. In my view the meaning of the term 'CFJ'
is quite clearly set out in R991:

      Any document submitted to the Clerk of the Courts and which is
      clearly marked as a Call for Judgement is a Call for Judgement.

      The Clerk shall distribute the text of a Call for Judgement,
      along with any additional material submitted by the Caller
      (including, but not limited to, Arguments and Evidence) not
      later than the time e announces the identity of the first Judge
      assigned to Judge it.

If we take this as decisive, then Murphy cannot amend his CFJ: his
CFJ is a document he submitted to the CotC; it is that very document
which R789 requires be accompanied by a list of Relevant rules; it
is that very document which was not so accompanied, and there is nothing
he can now do about it.

I began this message thinking that I would find in the Rules clear
evidence of another, more general usage of 'CFJ', according to which
it would mean 'the document distributed the CotC after Judgement
is delivered' or some such thing. To my surprise, however, not only
could I find no clear evidence of such a usage, I could find no 
evidence of any usage which substantially conflicts with the definition
given in R991. My happy conclusion is that Rules are surprisingly clear
about the meaning of the term 'CFJ'.

Never mind: the Rules are convincing enough. For instance, R1563:

Rule 1563/1 (Power=1)
Statement of a CFJ

      In order to be Judged, a Call for Judgement must contain a
      single clearly-labeled Statement which must be able to be
      determined by the means of logical reasoning, with the
      presumption of perfect knowledge, to be either TRUE or FALSE.

      If a Call for Judgement does not contain a Statement of the sort
      required by this Rule, its Judge is required to dismiss the CFJ,
      as described elsewhere.

Things don't in general contain themselves, so I've little choice but to
conclude that CFJs are not to be identified with their Statements, which
they contain. Furthermore, the talk of dismissal here is so evidently
designed to go hand in hand with R1565(iv) that I'm convinced that it
would be mistaken to interpret that clause as allowing or requiring me
to dismiss the CFJ on the grounds that its Statement fails to comply
with the Rules. As I first suspected, the Statement is perfectly legal;
only the CFJ which contains it is illegal, and on that R1565 is silent.

So option (2) is out. Only (1) and (3) remain. Isn't anyone going to
argue for (1) ? After all, an illegal Kudo transfer is not a Kudo
transfer. Why should we think that an illegal CFJ is a CFJ?

Indeed.  Oerjan has also pointed this out.

According to my Stare Decisis list, on CFJ 860 the decision was just opposite:

Court of Appeal, 860:
This is only applicable if the statement claims that a certain Rule has to
be interpreted a certain way, not if it claims the Rules in general have to
be interpreted a certain way.
The list of Relevant Rules needs not be explicit.

Unfortunately I cannot find the original Judgement. Both Vanyel and Michael
have CFJ Archives on the web, but Michael's starts at CFJ 871, while
Vanyel's has only the Assignment of the Appeal, not its Decision.

IMHO "an act or a failure to act" clearly attempts to cover the
totality of a class, not to cite a few instances as representative of
a larger class, which is what I'd consider to be "the start of a
list".
<<

It may not explicitly _say_ it is the start of such a list; maybe it
even wasn't meant to be. But it becomes that because other rules, like
1713, add to this list.

>>[order of citations does not agree with order in original message]
I'm not sure what 1503 claims or doesn't claim - but it sure doesn't
look similar to Rules which provide for extension or refinement of
the concepts they define (such as Election & Referenda).
<<

I would say that this difference between 1503 and rules on elections
and referenda is that the latter were _intended_ to set an expandable
framework right from the start, whereas the extension of the
definition given in 1503, say in 1713, occured after 1503 was written
and was not really expected or planned when 1503 was written.

So it's a difference in the history, or maybe in the intention of
these rules, but not in the resulting situation. All of this IMHO, of
course.

In Austin's conception (which is
archetypically positivist), Rule 789 would lack the status of "law"
because it lacks any concept of sanction.
<<

But in this sense most of our rules, and the concept of nomics, would
be rather pointless, wouldn't it? Very few of them provide explicit
penalties for misbehaviour.

The basic rules, like 101, don't work due to sanctions but on the
basis of metarules everyone follows. 

For example I liked Acka's reasoning that if IN proposal 346 gets
through and Acka doesn't imply the required rule changes they must
withdraw from Internomic. If they didn't, the'd violate IN 101
continuously - no penalty involved, but still not the point of playing
nomic.

This still involves a lot of communication between the Cartographor
and the Promotor/Assessor - the Cartographor doesn't know about votes
cast privately, for example. 

>>
     As soon as possible after an Assessor's Report is published, the
     Cartographor shall pay out 1 VT to each Player who cast at least
     one Vote, but no Absentee Votes, since the previous Assessor's Report.
<<

I think as it stands this also may cover votes whose voting period is
still running - say, a proposal's voting period begins two days before
an Assessor's Report is published. In that case the Assessor is not
even allowed to tell the Cartographor who voted when, so the
Cartographor doesn't know who to pay VTs to (as long as we don't adopt
Steve's public voting proposal).

You might either allow such a disclosure explicitly, (to make point d)
of 1625 apply) or change the time of the extra VT payments to ASAP
after the publication of voting results.

Possibly:  The Frankenstein Monster(s) (if any) probably do not prohibit or

<<

But isn't that the point? The sentence "changing the Frankenstein
Monsters, which is permitted only when a Frankenstein Monster or set
of Frankenstein Monsters explicitly or implicitly permits it." makes
an explicit or implicit regulation by the F _Monster_ a prerequisite
for changing it. However, the only regulations for changes of the FM I
can see are provided for in the F _Rule_, the F _Generator_ and the F
_Mutator_. 

So the FM cannot be changed, and we have a Win by Pitchfork. To be
honest, I first suspected that your "plastic surgery" proto was an
attempt to gain the position of Winner by Pitchfork before this win
was announced - but now it looks as if you'd win anyway.

in 991 is clear enough, and CFJ 938 is a CFJ. Even 1563, which makes
further requirements of a CFJ, only says "In order to be Judged, a

not have to be judged.

So I would tend to agree that CFJ 938 stands and must be judged,
although it does violate 789.

You have discovered a hole in the rules here: a CFJ that is not quite
properly made. The spirit of 1565 certainly is that it should be
dismissed, but the letter of 1565 does not allow this. This would also
be the obvious fix: say that CFJs which violate rules like 789 "lack
standing" in the sense of 1565 v). In fact, as a first reaction to
this problem I'd have said that 1565 v) already applies here, but
looking more closely this clause refers to something "defined
elsewhere", and at the moment it points nowhere.

So I see two possible fixes: 

1. Introduce a rule "A CFJ that does not fulfill all relevant
requirements lacks standing".

But this is a bit awkward, and I don't think that is what "lack
standing" really was supposed to mean - I'm not sure I understand the
phrase correctly, but I think it sounds more like a matter of the
consistency or relevance of content.

2. Amend 1565 iv) by replacing "Its Statement" with "It" (the CFJ). 

Sounds good at first - but why wasn't it done like that right away?
Perhaps it would make iv) too strong a requirement? In that case we
would have to find a more specific phrase that applies when a CFJ
violates requirements like those of 789, but is not as generic as "The
CFJ fails to comply with the Rules".

However, if there are no strong arguments against that, I'd propose
Fix 2. (Or do you want to, Steve?)

I disagree. The Angry Villagers Rule says:

      When a CFJ finds that, at some specified time, all proposed
      Amendments to the Frankenstein Rule were made impossible by the
      Frankenstein Generator, (...)

while the Frankenstein Rule says:

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Frankenstein Monster 
      is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing 
      the Frankenstein Monsters, which is permitted only when a 
      Frankenstein Monster or set of Frankenstein Monsters explicitly
      or implicitly permits it.

That is, if there is any possible change to the Frankenstein Rule, which
does not change the Frankenstein Monster(s), there is no Win by Pitchfork.
I think there still are such changes.

However, Agora _does_ have general sanctions, in Rule 1439.

This becomes more dubious when you also take into account parts (vi) and
(vii) of Rule 1672:

       vi) No Amendment can be applied to the Frankenstein Rule that
           is substantially the same as any prior successfully applied
           Amendment to the Frankenstein Rule.

      vii) All proposed Amendments to the Frankenstein Rule must
           consist of a single sentence of additional text specifying
           the properties and effects of a Frankenstein Monster, to be
           inserted between the first and last paragraphs. No proposed
           Amendment changing existing text beyond such an insertion
           shall be applied to the Frankenstein Rule, and no other
           proposed Rule Changes shall be applied to the Frankenstein
           Rule.

(vii) may mean that any Amendment must affect the FM, and (vi) means that
the Amendment must be something new, which implies that it must change it.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

I haven't had time to really dig into this one, but I would agree if the CFJ is
truly illegal, then it is not valid and should be thrown out and resubmitted.

Still has the problem of requiring Cartographor and other relevant Officer to
check time stamps to be sure the Vote or Proposal was actually made in the
proper location.  Unless you want to use the dreaded "legal deeming" to say
that, as long as the Player has spent some time in the Voting Booth or on the
Soap Box during the voting period, or in the week between the Promotor's
Reports, that any Votes cast or Proposals made are deemed to have been
cast/made in the proper location - but I don't think this is what you have in
mind.

Unfortunately, I can't think of any solution that does not require one
Officer or the other to provide a list of time-stamps to be checked before
paying out the rewards.  As Promotor, I wouldn't mind shipping off a copy of
each proposal with it's time stamp to the Cartographor, especially with the
current rate of proposals.  My support for this proposal, however, would depend
on the Assessor's and Cartographor's willingness to take on the extra work.

Require Players to make their Location explicit in any relevant message
under penalty of any Rule providing a benefit from doing actions in a
particular Location not being applicable otherwise. (Rules penalizing
actions in a particular Location are another matter.)

Like - "I hereby Vote FOR 3666, AGAINST 3667 - please note that I'm in
the Voting Booth.".

False claims would be subject to Falsification penalties.

I like the idea. The Assessor resp. Promotor would still be the only
ones with the necessary information to verify the claims (they have
the time stamps on the votes/proposals, and the cartographor's
report). But at least no extra communications would be needed.

This might work, as long as the Cartographor includes the time stamps of all

I have the Judgement. Thanks for finding the number. I'll post it in a
minute.

What your record don't show is that the Injunction issued by Judge
Greycell in CFJ 860 was Appealed, and set aside on Appeal, for
precisely the reasons I gave above. (Not surprisingly, since I was
one of the Justices on the Appeal of the Injunction. Eljefe and
Vanyel were the others.)

Anyway, I'll forward the Appeal Judgement so you can look at it.

I'll go further. I'm pretty sure I *don't* like them. It's just too
much damn work trying to support a MUD-like environment without an
MUD program to do all the actual work for you.

Some notes on this Appeal:

1. Looking more closely at the reasoning given by the Appeal Justices
I find I was the only Justice to argue that the list of Relevant Rules
must be explicit. Justice Favor argued the opposite; Justice elJefe
made no finding on that matter, basing his Judgement on other grounds.
So perhaps there is still room for argument about whether a list of
Relevant Rules has to be explicit. I'd like to add, however, that I stand
by my reasoning given in this Judgement: I still believe that it is best
to encourage Players to be explicit about which Rules they consider 
Relevant.

2. It is also worth nothing that elJefe argues explcitly against the
idea that a Player can add a list of Relevant Rules ex post facto, for
precisely the reasons I gave yesterday in reply to Scott.

Anyway, here's the complete Judgement.

======================================================================
             JUDGEMENT OF APPEALED INJUNCTION IN CFJ 860

  "Where the Rules call for a Player to be nominated to perform, or not 
   perform, any action or duty, it is sufficient to nominate an Officer 
   to perform that action, the current holder of that Office and eir 
   successor(s) then being responsible for the action or duty"

======================================================================

Under consideration:    whether the Injunction, that Rule 1590 be
    annotated to the effect of the Statement, had been made in accordance
    with the Rules.

Board of Appeals:            Decision:
    favor                    LEGAL
    elJefe                   ILLEGAL
    Steve                    ILLEGAL

Decision on the Injunction:  ILLEGAL

Judge:          Doug
Judgement:      TRUE

Caller:         Greycell
Barred:         
On Hold:        Blob     

Eligible:       Andre, Chuck, Coren, dcuman, Doug, elJefe, favor, 
                Gecko, Ghost, Jtael, Kelly, KoJen, Michael, 
                Morendil, Murphy, Steve, Swann, Vanyel, Zefram


Note:  The Judgement of TRUE is unaffected by the appeal of the Injunction.

       The Injunction is set aside and has no legal effect.

       Judge Doug commits an infraction (illegal injunction) and
         thereby loses 5 Points and gains 1 Blot. His Judicial
         salary for judging 860 is unaffected.

       Justices elJefe, favor, and Steve all earn Judicial salaries.

======================================================================

Requested Injunction [set aside]:

  that Rule 1590 be annotated to this effect.

======================================================================

Argument
--------
Rule 1590/0 (Maintainer of SLC's) requires a Player to be specified to maintain
a record of the content of a SLC.

Common sense dictates that this assignment should be synonymous with
assigniong the task to a specified Officer.

Since there are procedures within the Rules for ensuring that (as near as
dammit) any Officer is always a Player, this Judgement should hold.

======================================================================
Decision of Judge Doug:  TRUE

        I Judge that the statement is TRUE and grant the request for Injunction.
H. Rulekeepor, please make the requested annotation. 

        Since an Officer is always a particular Player (by 1006(5)), 
specifying an 
Officer satisfies 1590's requirement to specify a Player.  I would like to 
caution the Players that specifying an Officer is sufficient, but _not_ 
necessary, to specify a Player.  (The two concepts are _not_ synonymous.)

        I attach Rule 1590(0) and 1006(5) below as Evidence:
___________

Rule 1590/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Maintainer of SLCs

      For a SLC to be legally authorized, the Rules must specify a
      Player who is required to maintain a record of the content of
      that SLC; this Player is known as the Maintainer of that SLC.

      The Maintainer of a given SLC must provide a copy of it to any
      other Player who requests it, as soon as possible after the
      request is made.  E must also provide an updated copy of the SLC
      to all Players within its Jurisdiction as soon as possible after

Rule 1006/5 (Mutable, MI=1)
Defaults for Officers

      An Office is a position of authority or responsibility
      established by the Rules and held by a Player, who is called an
      Officer.  At any time, for each Office there shall be exactly
      one Officer who holds it.

      A position of responsibility or authority is only an Office if
      the Rules specifically designate it as such.  An Office only
      exists as long as there is a Rule in force which specifies that
      it exists.  If the Rule or Rules which mandated the existence of
      an Office are changed such that they no longer do so, that
      Office ceases to exist.

      A given Office has whatever duties, responsibilities, and
      privileges that the Rules assign to it.

Justice favor's decision on the Injunction:  LEGAL

I will consider each of the qualities necessary for an injunction
to have been made in accordance with the Rules:

  - Rule 663 requires the Injunction to specify the Player to
    whom it applies, and the requirements that it places upon
    that Player.  The text "H. Rulekeepor, please make the requested
    annotation." seems to satisfy these requirements.

  - Rule 663 also requires that the Injunction accompany the
    Judgement of a CFJ by the Judge.  That is also satisfied.

  - Rule 663 then requires that the Injunction be made in a
    situation where the Rules specifically permit it.  This
    is the point at issue.

  - Rule 789 permits the issuing of an Injunction if:
    - The CFJ was a CFJ "alleging that a Rule should be
      interpreted in a certain way", and
    - if the Caller has submitted a list of Rules relevant
      to that CFJ, which list must include the Rule in question.

Does the current Injunction fit the demands of Rule 789?  It is
certainly not the best example of an Injunction that does; in
the ideal case, the CFJ would include a statement beginning
"Rule 1590 should be interpreted so that...", and would include
a clearly labelled "List of relevant Rules: 1590".  On the
other hand, the Statement does clearly allege that the Rules
generally should be interpreted in a certain way, and that
way clearly has a bearing on the interpretation of 1590.
And in addition, the Caller *did* implicitly list the Rules
e considered relevant, in the text "Requested Injunction: /
that Rule 1590 be annotated to this effect."

I therefore find that it is reasonable to interpret this CFJ
as satisfying the requirements of Rule 789, and that the
injunction WAS therefore made in accordance with the Rules.
If the electorate desires a stricter standard, under which
legal documents have effect only if their every element is
spelled out and labelled in detail, then they should propose
and pass legislation requiring the filling out of standardized
forms, and have done with it.

Justice Favor

======================================================================
Decision of Justice Steve:  ILLEGAL

I hereby order that the Injunction issued by Judge Doug in his
Judgement of CFJ 860 be set aside.

The question before me is whether the Injunction issued by Judge Doug
accompanying his Judgement on CFJ 860 was issued in accordance with
the Rules, specifically, Rule 789. That Rule requires two things:
that the Statement of the CFJ allege that a Rule be interpreted in a
certain way, and second, that the Caller of a Rule interpretation
CFJ, in this case Greycell, include a list of relevant Rules. 

For reasons which should become apparent, I want to consider the
second of these requirements first, that is, the question of the
requirement of the Caller of a Rule interpretation CFJ to include a
list of relevant Rules. It is clear that Greycell did not explicitly
do this (see evidence attached).  The question is: did he do it
implicitly, and is this sufficient to satisfy the requirement in
R789?  

It is my view that the Rules are silent or at best unclear on this
matter, and so my Judgement falls within the province of R217 and the
standards set out therein, in particular, commonsense and the best
interests of the game. It is plain to me that, barring future
legislation to the contrary, the precedent which my fellow Justices
and I set here will become established as game custom. It is
therefore important to consider what kind of precedent it would be
best to set. 

The choice is between allowing Players to provide a list of Rules
implicitly in their Arguments, as Greycell did, or forcing them to be
clear and explicit about what Rules they consider relevant. Keeping
before me considerations about how I should like Players to act in 
future such cases, I think it by far preferable that Callers should
be required to be clear and explicit about what Rules they believe
are relevant to the CFJ. This should reduce needless wrangling about
whether or not a Rule is relevant. The extra burden imposed on the
the Caller is minimal. So my Judgement is that Greycell's inclusion
of an implicit list is insufficient and that therefore Judge Doug
was not empowered to issue an Injunction under R789.

However, turning now to the first question, namely, the requirement
in R789 that the Statement allege that a Rule be intepreted in a
certain way, we now find a further, and in fact overriding, reason
for setting aside Judge Doug's Injunction, and that is that Greycell's
Statement did not allege that a Rule should be interpreted in a certain
way. Rather, it alleged that *the Rules* ought to be interpreted in
a certain way. In my view this is insufficient to qualify Greycell's
Statement as a Rule interpretation CFJ. Since under Rule 663/3,
Judges are empowered to issue Injunctions only when specifically
authorized to do so, Judge Doug was certainly not empowered to
issue a Rule interpretation Injunction accompanying a CFJ which was
not a Rule interpretation CFJ! So it is here we find the primary
reason for setting aside Judge Doug's Injunction.

It is a shame that I cannot use this opportunity to issue an Injunction
that the Rulekeepor self-referentially annotate R789.

----- 3. Rule 789/2

Rule 789/2 (Mutable, MI=1)
Injunctions on Interpretations of Rules

      When a player makes a CFJ alleging that a Rule should be
      interpreted in a certain way, e shall also submit a list of
      Rules relevant to that CFJ, which must include the Rule in
      question.  If the statement is Judged TRUE, the Judge may
      include with the Judgement an Injuction requiring the Rulekeepor
      to annotate the Rule in question with the Statement in the CFJ
      and the list of relevant Rules.

      The annotation shall remain only until one of the Rules in the
      list of relevant Rules is changed in any way; or until a CFJ
      determines that the injunction no longer applies, as described
      below.  While it remains, it shall guide the application of that
      Rule.

      If a Player believes that the circumstances which led to the
      Judgement no longer prevail and the annotation is therefore no
      longer applicable, e may submit a CFJ to that effect. If it is
      Judged TRUE, the annotation shall be stricken from the rule set.

----- 4. Rule 663/3

Rule 663/3 (Mutable, MI=1)
Injunctions--General

      Judges shall, in certain situations when specifically authorized
      by the Rules, have the power to issue orders requiring one or
      more Players to perform (or refrain from performing) one or more
      Actions.  Such an order is called an Injunction.

      An Injunction, in order to be legally made, must:

        * specify the Player or Players to whom it applies and the
          Action or Actions that Player or Players are required to
          perform (or refrain from performing).
        * accompany the Judgement of a Call for Judgement, of which
          the Player issuing the Injunction is the Judge; and
        * be an Injunction issued in a situation where the Rules
          specifically permit the Judge an Injunction to restrain a
          Player or Players in the manner specified.

      An Injunction which does not meet these criteria, or which has
      otherwise been issued in a manner which is not consistent with
      the Rules, has no legal effect.

      A Judge issues an Injunction by transmitting it to the Clerk of
      the Courts simultaneously with the Judgement it accompanies.

======================================================================
Decision of Justice elJefe:  ILLEGAL

In the appeal of the Injunction in CFJ 860, I hold the injunction not
to have been made in accordance with the Rules.

The statement of the CFJ reads "Where the Rules call for a player...
it is sufficient ...".  This does not allege that "a Rule should be
interpreted in a certain way", as required by Rule 789.  The reference
to a Rule in another part of the CFJ is not enough to turn this statement
into an allegation about a particular Rule.  Indeed, the statement
applies to all rules and not just Rule 1590.

Since there is no Rule allowing an injunction to be issued in this 
situation (Rule 908 clearly not applying), the injunction is illegal
under Rule 663.

I make no determination about the validity of an "implicitly included
list of relevant Rules" except to point out:

1.) Game Custom may have allowed these in earlier CFJs,

and also

2.) Greycell's post-facto submission of an explicit "list of relevant
    rules" would not have helped, since Rule 789 explicitly requires
    that the Caller "has included a list of Rules" relevant to the CFJ.
    At the very least the list must be submitted before the Injunction,
    and IMO as part of the CFJ.

I think in a way, we must have been through all this before with the
Kudo Transfer Rules, and probably with other Rules as well. The
problem lies in interpreting the word 'must'. I think, once upon a
time, the Kudo Transfer Rule probably said something like: "A
[message containing a] Kudo transfer must contain a justification for
the transfer." (Can the Archivist or Rulekeepor dig up some previous
versions of R1378 to see if that is true?) Then it was pointed out
that this is ambiguous between "A Kudo transfer without a
justification is illegal and has no effect" and "A Player who makes a
Kudo transfer without a justification violates this Rule (incurring
whatever sanctions may be in place for doing so)."

The first interesting thing to note is that I reckon we probably settled
on the first interpretation for the case of Kudo transfers, so that
transfers without justifications were considered no transfers at all.
But secondly, we were evidently unhappy enough with the ambiguity
in 'must' that we completely rewrote R1378, totally removing any
language of that kind:

Rule 1378/3 (Power=1)
Kudo Transfers

      A single Kudo shall be transferred from one Player (the
      "Victim") to a second Player (the "Beneficiary") when a Player
      (the "Transferer") sends a message to the Herald indicating that
      e is transferring a Kudo from the Victim to the Beneficiary, and
      all the following conditions hold:

      a) the Transferer has not, during the current Nomic Week,
         previously caused two or more Kudo transfers;
      b) the Transferer is not the same Player as the Beneficiary;
      c) The Transferer has not, during the current Nomic Week,
         previously transferred a Kudo away from the Victim or to the
         Beneficiary;
      d) the Victim has at least one Kudo; and
      e) the message contains a justification for the transfer.

      This Rule does not in any way prohibit other Rules from causing
      changes to a Player's Honour.

Well, you'll get no argument from me. But then the Agoraverse is not my

This does not completely knock out the argument for (1). Not that I'm
committed to (1), you understand. I'm just exploring the possibilities.

Option (1), you'll recall, basically says that CFJ 938 isn't really
a CFJ at all, just something that looks like one. This is derived from
an interpretation of R789 on which we read the 'must' in "A CFJ
alleging a Rule should be interpreted in a certain way must be
accompanied by a list of relevant Rules..." as meaning 'must, in
order to count as a CFJ'. I think this is a pretty plausible reading
of R789, even if not the only one.

But if that's right, then we have this situation: R789 says that
CFJ 938 is not a CFJ, since it isn't accompanied by a list of Relevant
Rules, while R991 says it is a CFJ, since it was submitted to the
CotC clearly marked as such. So the Rules conflict, and R789 takes
precedence. So - voila! - CFJ 938 is not really a CFJ.

As far as I can see, both options (1) and (3) remain alive at this
point.

Not really. The term was introduced by Scott for reasons which he
himself has probably by now forgotten. It's borrowed from RL legal
systems, where 'to lack standing' means somethinkg like 'to be
legally judged not to have the right to bring a certain matter before
the Court." So, I can't sue British Petroleum (for instance), for
environmental damage caused by their negligence unless I can show
that I have been directly harded by that negligence; otherwise, I
lack standing to bring such a suit. Of what use this concept is
supposed to be in Agora I'm not at all sure; nor am I sure why I
opposed Michael's campaign some time back to have that clause in
R1565 simply deleted. I think I would support such a proposal now.

No, you go ahead.

Feel free to proto such clauses.  I could add them to mine and give you
co-author credit, if you like.
