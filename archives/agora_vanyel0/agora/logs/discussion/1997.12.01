He was elected to these positions at the same time as I became Speaker
and for all that he wasn't registered at the time, he hasn't been
deregistered either, getting around 1555, and because the election
rule takes precedence over 1006, it seems that he was a non-Player
officer for these positions as well.  It also seems to me that his
subsequent registration won't have altered his tenure of these
positions.  

However, it is possible that he isn't holding these Offices in the
normal fashion.  

What does everyone think?

Michael.

During the period that Morendil was not a player, so it seems those
Offices were not held in the normal fashion (see Appelate Judgement in
CFJ 1065 (or is it 1066?)). Thus, Rule 790 does fire, and an Election
must be called, even though now the Office is held in the normal fashion
again.

However, after the Elections a new problem might arise, as Rule 790
clearly states that both Morendil and the new Officer are holding the
Office, and thus is in conflict with itself.

Re: Infected Voting

Here is a thought.  It's my impression, from previous discussion, that Votes
cast during the TO Infection are legally cast votes but it's the failure of the
implicit Transfer Order to be successfully executed which prevents them from
being counted in figuring out the results.  Rule 1442 does not make an explicit
claim of precedence and Rule 955 makes no claim of deference.  Why doesn't the
higher precedence of Rule 955 force the Assessor to count the votes anyway, as
specified in that rule?  Below is the text of the Rules in question.

-- Crito

Rule 1442/11 (Power=1)
Using VTs

      The casting of any votes may only be achieved by the spending
      of VTs, as specified below.

      A Voting Entity Votes upon a Proposal when e, during the Voting
      Period of that Proposal, informs the Assessor of the Vote (or
      Votes) e is casting upon that Proposal.  This act also comprises
      the implicit submission of a delayed Transfer Order from the
      Voting Entity to the Bank for however many VTs are necessary to
      cast those Votes, to be executed at the end of the Voting Period
      of that Proposal, and also the implicit cancellation of all
      other delayed Transfer Orders submitted but not yet executed by
      Voting on that Proposal.

      A Voting Entity may specify that e casts no Votes on a Proposal,
      and doing so cancels any previously Votes cast on that Proposal
      (if done during the Voting Period of that Proposal) and cancels
      any delayed Transfer Orders submitted but not yet executed by
      Voting on that Proposal.

      A Voting Entity's Votes on a given Proposal are counted for that
      Proposal only if the delayed Transfer Order implicitly submitted
      by Voting on that Proposal is successfully executed at the end
      of the Voting Period of that Proposal.


Rule 955/3 (Power=3)
Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal

      When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the Votes which
      have been legally cast shall be counted by the Assessor.  The
      Proposal shall then be assigned a Voting Index, as follows: the
      Proposal received no Votes opposed, and at least one Vote in
      favor, the Voting Index shall be Unanimity; if there are no
      Votes in favor, the Voting Index shall be zero; in all other
      cases, the Voting Index shall be the number of Votes in favor
      divided by the number of Votes opposed.

      If the Voting Index is greater than the Adoption Index for the
      given Proposal, or if both equal Unanimity, then that Proposal
      passes.  Otherwise, it fails.

Is it?  I said the following Players.  Since Vlad is not a Player, no
Payment Order adheres.

I suppose you might claim that my message alleges that Vlad is a

<<

When I read Crito's post I thought so, too. But now I've gone through
the rules with a word search for "cast". Here are some observations
that I made.


1. Rule 683: Votes are "cast" at the time they are sent to the PF
(considering the public voting experiment). 

They are "legally cast" if "cast during the Voting Period of that
Proposal, and if that Voting Entity is entitled to cast a Vote on that
particular Proposal." 

The votes ignored by Scott were thus "legally cast", no matter what
the virus says.


2. 1442 states that 

      A Voting Entity's Votes on a given Proposal are counted for that
      Proposal only if the delayed Transfer Order implicitly submitted
      by Voting on that Proposal is successfully executed at the end
      of the Voting Period of that Proposal.

However, 955 says nothing about this condition and only refers to
votes "legally cast" (see above). Due to higher power (3 vs 1) it wins
the precedence conflict with 1442.

This sounds as if the votes were valid, after all.


3. But there is more:

1442 says that "The casting of any votes may only be achieved by
the spending of VTs, as specified below." This may not concern the
definition of "legally cast", but it does make a requirement for a
vote to be "cast" at all.

Also, 206 (power 2) states that "The casting of any votes may only be
achieved by the casting of Voting Tokens, as specified in other
Rules." 

This makes more requirements than 955, but doesn't really _conflict_
with 955's requirements (in this case 955's power of 3 would win), but
extends them. So: no VTs cast, no votes cast.


4. The fun part: The adoption of a proposal does not depend on the
"cast" or "not cast" or "legally cast" status of votes, at all. In
fact, I think 955 is quite poorly worded here.

First, it requires that at the end of the voting period "the Votes
which have been legally cast shall be counted by the Assessor."
However, it could also require the assessor to count the buttons on
eir shirt or anything else, because the number of legally cast votes
is not referred to anymore in the rest of 955.

What counts is simply the "number of Votes in favor divided by the
number of Votes opposed." You may say that the first sentence makes it
clear that this referes to only votes legally cast, but I'm not sure
whether this is really the wording of the rule or just the authors
intention - note that the "pathological" values for the voting index
(unanimity and zero) are defined using different language: unanimity
depends on the number of votes "received" by the proposal, whatever
that is (can a proposal own votes? erm, I think that was another
thread... ;), zero is the voting index if "there are" no votes in
favor. 


I'm not quite sure what to make of this, but the wording of 955 is not
really crystal clear - maybe "the Voting Index shall be the number of
_legally cast_ Votes in favor divided by the number of _legally cast_
Votes opposed." would be more legalistic, but it certainly would be
less ambiguous.

P.S. While we're at it: where do the rules define that (or whether)
"unanimity" (not a number) is greater than an adoption index (which is
given as a number)? In other words, doesn't the last paragraph of 955,

      If the Voting Index is greater than the Adoption Index for the
      given Proposal, or if both equal Unanimity, then that Proposal
      passes.  Otherwise, it fails.

state that proposals with an adoption index unequal to unanimity, but
an adoption index of unanimity (all proposals which won Zeitgeist
titles) failed?

Let me SEE, are you SAYING that we don't need VTs to Vote?

*Turning on Predictomatic MARK 3-1/2*

I see a large CRISIS in Agora's past, BASED on Voting becoming temporarily
ineffective, with many Proposals failing without this being noticed
before long after.

I see a huge Crisis in Agora's NEAR future, based on those Proposals
HAVING passed anyhow.

I PREDICT FILM AT 11,
Ørjan.

I would say that you incorrectly alleged that Vlad was a Player and then
incorrectly issued a PO to em.  Your interpretation below is technically
correct, so I won't make an issue out of it.  I will consider the message to
*not* include a PO for Vlad, once you deny the claim.

Is it?  I said the following Players.  Since Vlad is not a Player, no
Payment Order adheres.

I suppose you might claim that my message alleges that Vlad is a
Player.

The way I read R1442, the vote is cast as described in the first paragraphs but
then not counted towards the results according to the last paragraph.

Would not a Vote which the Rules mandate not be counted be properly

Except of course that I don't pay the Petition Fees, due to the infection

That was certainly my reaction on reading the two Rules.

I read this as making the spending of VTs a requirement for the votes
to be legally cast,

'the casting of Voting Tokens'??? What a horrid construction! How did
that get into R206?

Again, I prefer to read the Rule in context as defining the Voting
Index in terms of the legally cast Votes for and against, as you
suggest below.

Rule 1274/1 (Power=3)
Definition of Indices

      Let there be a class of Entities known as "Indices" (singular:
      "Index").  An Index shall have a value, which is either a
      non-negative real number or the special value "Unanimity".

      An Index of Unanimity is greater than any other Index.  When
      comparing other Indices, the Index which is numerically greater
      is the greater Index.

I think there is still some room for manoeuvre here. My Judgement in
CFJ 1070 establishes that in certain rather extraordinary
circumstances, being a Player and being Registered are not the same
thing.  However, the Courts have not yet been asked to Rule on the
question of whether ceasing to be a Player and being deregistered
are the same thing. Although I regard it as unlikely, it could yet be
that they are. If so, then if Morendil ceased to be a Player when he
ceased to be Speaker, that would have counted as his being
deregistered, triggering the provisions in R1555.

I note that there are reasons to think that there is not a perfect
symmetry between being registered and being deregistered. As I noted
in my Judgement of CFJ 1070, R869 defines being registered as a 
property obtained by sending a certain kind of message to the PF.
R1043 is constructed a little differently. It says that you *can*
deregister by sending a certain kind of message to the PF, but that
deregistration is also possible by other means. It also makes a link
between between being deregistered and ceasing to be a Player, although
not in a way that makes it easy to argue that ceasing to be a Player
implies derigstration.

If, as seems more likely, Morendil was not deregistered when he
ceased to be a Player (ie when he ceased to be Speaker), then I
think I agree with Andre's analysis. In accordance with the Appellate
Judgement of CFJ 1065, the Offices would at some point not have been
held in the normal fashion, triggering Elections for them despite the
fact that they are now being held in the normal fashion. Andre may
also be right about this causing a self-conflict in R790.

I read it as specifying that the procedure "specified below" defines how VTs
may be spent in order to cast votes.  It then goes on to say that votes are
cast by sending a message to the Assessor which causes an implicit TO for a VT
to be created.  At this point I would say the vote has been cast, legally,
according to R1442.  It goes on to specify that the TO is delayed until the end
of the voting period and then it seeks to prevent the vote from being counted
if the TO fails.  Nowhere does it say you have to have a VT in your possession
in order to cast a vote.  Spending money you don't have is a time honored
tradition, now a days, so the first sentence only seems to me to define how you
spend VTs, whether you have them or not.  It seeks to prevent your vote from
being counted if you don't have a VT in your possession at the end of the
period, but then this conflicts with R955 which requires the Assessor to count
them anyway.

8)  Yes, I seem to remember somebody complaining about that at the time.  In
any case, the only thing that can remotely be considered the "other Rules" here
is R1442, which, as I see it, allows you to cast votes whether you have VTs or
not.
