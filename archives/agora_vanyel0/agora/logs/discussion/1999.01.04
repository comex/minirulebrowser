Hi everyone,

This is just a message to say that I'm back from my holidays.
Unfortunately, there appear to have been some problems with deilvery of
agora mail to my address: gecko reports that I missed 22 messages while
I was away. My main questions are:

1. Have the results of Proposals 3819-3820 been published?
2. Have any CFJs been called?
3. Has voting commenced in the Election for Treasuror? Who are the
   Candidates?

I haven't seen any mails concerning these issues. In fact, I have only
seen two or three Agora messages in all of last week.

While I agree that 947 shouldn't always pay out P-Notes, like it does,
I'm not sure I like giving the Rulekeepor arbitrary control over this,
nevermind also allowing em to pay out VTs. As stated, this proposal
gives em more power to hand out currency than even the Speaker is 
allowed. There should be more restrictions to prevent abuse.

I hereby issue a new Budget, to include Peekee. I have brought em in
at the same base-level as all other non-Office holders. Since it looks 
like Proglet will be silent soon, I have simply transferred Proglet's
allocation to em. Since I had .4 VTs left to play with, I will also
grant this to Peekee, as a (small) new Player award. I am sorry that
I cannot offer any more.

Ah, right.  For some reason I had switched that in my mind to Tuesday, midnight.
Looks like all the Promotor stuff I did today was unofficial.  Blob, do
you need anything from me in order to pick things back up?
