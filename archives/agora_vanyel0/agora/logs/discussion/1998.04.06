Interesting.  If you see a conflict here, then what are we supposed to do about
zero priority proposals?  Are you also saying then, that the Promotor may not
remove any proposals from the queue after one month of zero priority?

Personally, I think it is reasonable to consider R1774 as adding conditions on
"the proper way", rather than conflicting with it.  Moving the proposal through
the queue into a position where it can be distributed is part of "making" a
proposal.  But I'm prepared to be argued out of this position.

If I were you, I would vacate that P-Note transfer.

That provision of R106 is also problematic in that it doesn't impose
a time limit in which Proposals must be voted upon.  I'm not
sure what bearing that has here, but it's something
to consider.

Right.  If we are going to go this route, then I would still say that R106 does
not prevent Harlequin from removing a proposal from the queue, even though
Steve's interpretation would mean that an obligation to vote on it still
remains.

What should be 5?  I show that the Bank still owes you .5 VTs which would bring
it up to 5, but the transfer has not yet taken place.

Except that if you remove the Proposal from the queue, you extinguish
all legal possibility that the Proposal might be legally voted upon.
Therefore, you cannot remove the Proposal from the queue.  Pretty
obvious, if you ask me.

I believe that Rule 106 allows the vote on a Proposal to be
indefinitely postponed, but prohibits a Proposal from being
permanently removed from the possibility of being voted upon at some
time in the future.  Since our custom (and Rule 1483) holds that a
reproposal is a different Proposal, holding that a removed Proposal
can be reproposed does not satisfy Rule 106.

I believe that is the natural and immediate consequence of Rule 106.

I don't think this argument is tenable.  Rule 1774 says nothing about
the manner of making Proposals; it speaks only to the distribution of
same.  I consider Rule 1483 to be definitive on the matter of making
Proposals, and do not believe that Rule 1774 informs Rule 1483 in any
way on the issue.

But there is no legal possibility of legally voting upon a zero priority
proposal either.  There is a possibility that subsequent actions by Players may
make it possible to vote on such a proposal, but that is also true of the one
that was removed from the queue (although it would take actions that cause Rule
changes in that case).

I think your interpretation means the Promotor must keep track of all
proposals submitted to em that have not yet been distributed, for whatever
reason, until such time as the Rules change so that e is either forced to
distribute them or can safely delete them from the game state (or they can be
voted upon without being distributed).  Either that, or your interpretation
prevents proposals from having a priority lower than one.  In other words, the
queue is just as artificial a construct as the priority of a proposal, IMO any
conflict that applies to the status of a proposal wrt to one, in terms of
allowing voting, must apply to the other as well.

Yes, there is.  Its priority could be raised by any of a variety of
legal actions not requiring any change to the Rules.  (There is also
the possibility of illegal distribution.)

I personally believe that actions which change the Rules should be
treated as different for this purpose from actions which do not change
the Rules.  I point out to you that Rule 217 requires a Judge to
consider the Rules _as they existed_ at the time a CFJ was called.
This, to me, seems to preclude considering hypothetical Rules which
might or might not exist in the future (except, of course, for
purposes of illustration).  Consider also our history of interpreting
Rule 114.

Yes, I believe that is correct, with the comment that any change to
the Rules that would allow the Promotor to delete such undistributed
Proposals would necessarily involve amending or superseding Rule 106
(or, alternatively, Rule 108).

I don't believe that Rule 106 requires the timely distribution of
Proposals, so I see no basis in law for requiring that the priority of
a Proposal be always greater than zero.

So does that mean that R106 prohibits a Proposal from being permanently
removed from the possibility of being voted upon at some
time in the future, given our current Ruleset, or only that
R106 prohibits a Proposal from being permanently removed from the
possibility of being voted upon at some time in the future,
taking into account potential future Rulesets?

I agree with this, but I'm not convinced this principle extends to the
resolution of the potential Rule conflict in this case.  Your example doesn't
fit that pattern.

For the same reason, I see no basis in law for requiring that a proposal
physically remain in the queue.

The Proposal Queue

The recent discussion sparked another thought.  What Rule prevents the Promotor
from putting a deleted proposal back in the queue at any time e wants, so long
as the proposal has already been "properly made"?

passed, and votes may no longer be retracted or cancelled once cast.

Your votes on Proposals 3720-3724 are noted.

I note with interest and approval that since the most recent amendment
to R833 on Feb 12, a little under 2 months ago, the number of P-Notes
in circulation has gradually declined from 283 to 241, indicating a
slight undersupply of P-Notes. If Tabula Rasa passes, P-Notes should
get real scarce, real quickly.

I don't see that aspect of R106 as problematic. The Rules dealing with
the Proposal Queue deal with that issue adequately without conflicting
in any way with R106.

Is the idea here to score 20 Points (potentially, I suppose, an unlimited
number of Points) by making a transfer and then vacating it, and then
remaking it? If so, I'm not sure that it works: R1802 says that vacated
TOs have no effect, presumably including the effect of buying Points.

Once a Proposal is removed from the Queue, that same Proposal cannot
be voted on without a change in the Rules.

This depends on whether R1802 succeeds in retroactively depriving a TO of past
effects.  Once a TO has been executed and the transfer has taken place, a TO no
longer has any (currently existing) effects of which it can be deprived.  The
wording of 1806 does not explicitly specify deprivation of *past* effects.  
Indeed, the Rules admit of the fact that R1802 cannot deprive a vacated TO of
the past effect of the transfer actually having occurred, nor can it remove any
collateral effects of the transferred currency having been spent in some manner
by the original payee.

Only if you think the rules prevent the Promotor from reintroducing it into the
queue at some later time.

Are you saying that it's your view that the Rules *definitely* rule out
the possibility that vacating a TO deprives it of its past effects, or only
that this is one interpretative possibility?

But secondly, notice that not all of the effects of the TO lie in the past:
the Scorekeepor may not yet have adjusted eir records to reflect the effect
of the purchase of Points. That effect of the TO might still be cancelled
even if you're right that R1802 cannot deprive the TO of its past effects.

Why such strong opposition to P3721, Oerjan?

To the supporters of P3721, if you are out there:

P3721 requires AI=3 to pass. If you support measures to balance the
economy by increasing VT expenditure, please vote 2F on P3721.

One interpretative possibility.  But I tend to think that an interpretation
which allows some past effects to be reversed and not others is inconsistent.

>But secondly, notice that not all of the effects of the TO lie in the past:

Reflecting the change in score is a tertiary effect that results from the order
to change score posted by the Currency Recordkeepor, which was a secondary
effect from the transfer having taken place.  I would agree that 1802 works to
deprive these effects if the vacation occurs prior to the Recordkeepor having
made the actual transfer (although there is a problem here too, since it seems
the Rules deem that the transfer took place at the time the message was posted,
not at the time the Recordkeepor noted the message).  Tracking down all
possible collateral effects of a TO at all levels across temporal boundaries of
past and present is not an interpretation that I would find to be in the best
interests of the game.  If any other interpretation is possible and reasonable,
I would favor that one.

Of course I think the best solution is simply to prevent the stay, amendment or
vacation of a TO once it has been executed, as someone else suggested.

More Thoughts on the Proposal Queue

1.  All Proposals shall be voted upon.
2.  A Proposal may not be voted upon until it is distributed.
3.  No proposal may ever be distributed.

Which rule conflicts with rule 1?  Why 3 instead of 2?  Or 2 instead of 3?  Is
it possible that neither conflicts with 1?

A nice example to mull over. Pretty clearly, R2 doesn't conflict with
R1 unless R3 is also in play. But I tend to think that R3 conflicts with
R1 even without R2 in play, because mere commonsense would seem to tell us
that distribution is a precondition on voting. So that's why I'd say that
R3 and not R2 directly conflicts with R1.

Hiya,

I'll be visiting the US to deliver a paper at a conference at CMU (in
Pittsburgh) in June (around the 11th) and will be staying in that area
until July 24, when I will be attending a conference in Madison, 
Wisconsin. Is there anybody here who lives in that area whom I could
visit, or who might be able to put me up for a short while?

I emphatically mean the former, for the reasons I gave in a previous
reply to Crito.

Is there reason to think that this is possible? Here's a reason to think
that it's *not* possible: the Proposal Queue is a Nomic Entity, and its
properties may not be changed except in accordance with procedures defined
in the Rules. But the Rules defining the Proposal Queue say nothing 
about allowing the Promotor to reintorduce discarded Proposals into the
Queue. Therefore the Promotor is not permitted to do this.

"Physically"?

In any case, the reason it must remain is that there is no mechanism
in law for a Proposal to get back into the queue, short of amending
the Rules, which, as I have previously stated, is an option I believe
should not be considered in the analysis.

1011, I should expect.
