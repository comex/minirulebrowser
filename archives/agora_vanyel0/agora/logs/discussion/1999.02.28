That's not a conflict. Obviously a Player who did not participate
in a preceding round has no score from that round. Thus one has to
take their score from the round two previous in order to be seeded.

The Accountor has to keep track of the transaction anyway; it makes
sense to have them do it.

That's not quite true. They can't belong to "an already existing
Team". The phrasing indicates they can't belong to a Team that
existed before the AFT is executed. Only if that condition is
broken is the team dissolved.

No, it doesn't.  You've added an unnecessary step; instead of
Scorekeepor -> Chancellor (w/ Accountor taking note) and Chancellor -> 
Accountor, you have Scorekeepor -> Accountor, Accounter -> Chancellor, 
and then Chancellor -> Accountor.  Wasteful.

I don't believe that this is at all clear from the language of the
