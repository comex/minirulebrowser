I think that a Judge could reasonably interpret "publically" to mean
"via the Public Forum" in the circumstances.

But I can't publish them until they've been executed, which doesn't
happen until the Lead Justice sends them to me. This hasn't happened, as
far as I am aware.

This is an interesting idea. What worries me about it, however, is that
it concentrates in the hands of single Player decisions which at the
moment are distributed amongst a number of different Players. I think
that having these decisions made by different Players is more
interesting politically.

Nevertheless, I might be prepared to try this out for a quarter or two,
if you rewrite the Proposal with sunset clauses.

Then you would be less likely to vote for a treasurer that gave the 
Speaker-Elect a salary.

Can I ask why?  This way the unemployed will have more reasons to vote 
for a Treasurer that gives them a better benefit.  I see that if there 
was going to be a higher number of unemployed players this could tip 
the ballance but I don't think that would be a problem at present or 
in the near future.

I don't think that the decisions made by the Treasurer would be the 
same as that of any player or officer right now.  The idea is to have 
variable salaries, which I think just now can only be done by amending 
rules.

Wouldn't that be difficult as it amends several rules?

I would have to say that I think tax powers should be held by a 
different office, to spread power around, and create competition by 
different players trying to achieve their own goals, but using 
different powers.

Protobudget  to a public forum at least one week before the start of

A Candidates Protobudget should contain all the information that is 
required to be in a Treasuror's Budget.  However, if the Candidates

candidates Protobudget is the same as the last Treasuror's budget.  A 
Candidates Protobudget is only valid if it is posted to a public forum 
at least one week before the start of the quarter in which they are 
standing for election.

A Candidate may amend their Protobudget by posting an amended version 
to a public forum at least one week before the start of the quarter in 
which they are standing for election.  If the amended Protobudget is 
posted with in one week of the beginning of the new quarter it is not 
valid.

elected to the office of Treasuror.  The Treasuror's budget shall 
remain the same as in the previous quarter.

(4) Any other material that is required by the rules to be in the 
Treasuror's budget.

The above shall be given in integer multiples of 0.1 of the Basic 
Officer Salary, between 0 and 4 times the BOS inclusive.

If there is no valid version of the Treasuror's budget, there shall be 
a budget created as soon as possible by the chancellor.  This budget 
shall contain all the information that is required to be in the 
Treasuror's budget and shall be set, as best as is possible to the

Ah.  I see we have a misunderstanding as to what it means to
"execute" an Order.  I was taking "execute" to mean that 
the Order is made official - which can't happen until you 
publish it.

I had assumed that, as Justiciar, my posting the Orders
to a-b was sufficient to constitute a deliverance to the
CotC, who would then publish them upon receiving
concurrence from another Justice (which has already
happened in both cases).  However, if you feel it necessary
for me to post another copy, I will do so as soon as I can.

You could rewrite it in the following way: the Rules that are currently
amended in the proto are amended differently instead, by appending to
them clauses which suppress their effects for the period of the trial.
Additionally, new Rules are created with self-Repeal clauses attached to
them which bear the substance of the amendments you wish to make.
