I'm probably going to Judge this TRUE, but before I do, I'd like
to know what the situation regarding Injunctions is. Do I have the
Power to enjoin the Assessor to vacate POs made under the assumption
that R833 does cause the Proposer of a failed Disinterested Proposal
to be billed 1 P-Note? R1737 says that the Rules "may require, in
certain cases, that a Judge issue an Injunction ordering that a
Payment Order be vacated." Is this one of those cases?

There are three objections here, not all equally good. 

1. Scaling. The number of Players has been relatively constant between
about 14 and 18 for some time now. If for some reason we do get as
high as 25 Players, and I can't see that happening in the near future,
we can amend the Rule again at that time.

2. Applying the test. The only issue is uncertainty about holdings;
given certainty about that, what could be simpler than applying such
a test? I'll have a think about ways to minimize the uncertainty. 
Perhaps a reference to 'good faith determination'? :) Your point
about the proposed split in the functions of the Assessor is legitimate,
but a GFD clause could handle that as well, I suspect.

3. Manipulation by the Chancellor. The Chancellor executes whatever
transfers are necessary to meet POs made by the Assessor (or by other
persons).  By far the largest number of these are required by the
very Rule I want to amend. By reducing the amounts of such POs,
the Chancellor's ability to manipulate such ammters will be greatly
reduced.
