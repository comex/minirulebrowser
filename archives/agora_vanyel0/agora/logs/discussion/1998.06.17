In my role as temporary Cartographor, until such time as the Elections
over, I have been endeavoruing to put together a Report. I am working on
the assumption that none of the recent Plot purchases have succeeded, for
the reasons Scott has posted.

I have taken the liberty of summarising, rather than listing outright,
the names, ownership and adjaceny of all 100 Plotts in existance.

I have no proof that any Ergs exist whatsoever, so for the time being
I am working on the assumption that their are none.

That about covers it. If anyone disputes these assumptions, then I
welcome any information they can provide to show otherwise.

Dear Blob,

thanks for the update.

I'm not sure about the issue of buying the first plots for a price of
0 Ergs, which requires a transfer of 0 Ergs to the bank (and, because
this is a null action, no TOs need be involved.) I have submitted a
CFJ to clarify this.

Concerning the existence of Ergs, P3744 contained the provision 

>>
Create a Rule with this text:

      Upon the creation of this Rule:
        * All Voting Tokens and P-Notes are destroyed.
        * All obligations to transfer Currency due to Rule 1754
            ("Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank") are cancelled.
        * For each Player, 5 VTs, 1 P-Note, and 30 Ergs are created in
            that Player's possession.

      One second after this Rule is created, it repeals itself.
<<

What made this creation of Ergs fail in your opinion?

Kolja A.

Rule 1578 might:

      If the designated Recordkeepor of a Currency ceases to be a
      Player, the Speaker shall fulfill that responsibilty until a new
      Recordkeepor is selected according to whatever procedure
      applies.  If there is no procedure defined for selecting a new
      Recordkeepor, then all units of that Currency are destroyed and
      the Currency ceases to exist.

I believe that second one should revoke voting privileges from 
Murphy, not Swann again.
