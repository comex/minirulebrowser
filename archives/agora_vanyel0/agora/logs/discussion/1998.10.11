Could Speaker Blob and Registrar Michael please clarify publically their

Proto-Proposal
A Duty to Propose

[Comment: I've developed a procedure for dealing with Players who are On
Hold. I've tried to make the instructions to the Promotor as clear as I
can. Please bring any problems to my attention.]

[v2.1: I've changed the Officer responsible for determining who has the
duty to propose from the Promotor to the Registrar, in order to avoid
having two Officers who need to keep track of Players going On and
coming Off Hold.

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "A Duty to Propose", be
created with the following text:

      Active Players not in their Grace Periods (henceforth in this
      Rule, 'Experienced Players') shall periodically incur a duty to
      submit a Proposal, as described in this Rule.

      The Registrar shall maintain an alphabetically sorted list of all
      Players. As soon as possible after the beginning of the Week, the
      Registrar shall perform the following procedure, which accomplishes
      the selection of the two Experienced Players to incur the duty to
      propose for that Week, the announcement of the names of those
      Players, and the updating of the list:

      (a) Experienced Players with an 'H' next to their names shall be
      selected before other Experienced Players. If there are more than
      two such Players, then the Registrar shall select the two highest
      on the list.
      
      (b) If, after selecting Experienced Players with an 'H' next to
      their names, there remain any places to be filled to bring the
      total number of Players selected for that Week to two, then the
      Registrar shall select the Experienced Player(s) highest on the list
      who do not have an asterisk ('*') next to their names. If there
      are not enough such Players, then only one Player is selected is
      selected for that Week.

      (c) The Registrar shall then announce in the Public Forum the names
      of the Players who have been selected for that Week. These Players
      have two weeks from the time of the Registrar's announcement to
      submit a Proposal. 

      (d) The Registrar shall then place an asterisk ('*') next to the
      names of the Players selected for that Week. If any of these
      Players had an 'H' next to their names, it shall be removed. 

      (e) If after step (d) is performed, it is the case that all
      Experienced Players have an asterisk next to their names, then the
      Registrar shall place an 'H' next to the name of any Player who is
      On Hold and who does not have an asterisk next to eir name, and
      remove all asterisks from the list.

      As stated above, the two Experienced Players selected by the
      Registrar each incur a duty to submit a Proposal within two weeks
      of the Registrar's announcement. Failure to do so is the Infraction
      of Failure to Propose, incurring a penalty of 1 Blot and 1 P-Note,
      to be detected and reported by the Registrar. The requirement to
      submit a Proposal placed upon a Player by this Rule lapses when
      the Player submits a Proposal, or when two weeks have elapsed from
      the time of the Registrar's announcement, whichever comes first.
