I was going to suggest 1/3 of Active Players or 5, whichever is greater.
But, I would support your suggestion, which is superior since it is
double indexed.

Nowhere do the Rules say that the Executor in Probate needs to be a
Player. The only thing they say is that to be elected as an Executor
in Probate one needs to be a Player.

The Appellants have argued that R1478 says that an Executor of an
Entity is a Player, and R1738 that an EiP is an Executor, and thus
an EiP must be a Player. However, this is not how Agoran logic works.
In Agora this means that the two Rules, in a case when an EiP is not a Player,
are in conflict. In Agora this means that the lower precedence Rule's
requirements are void. However, even if R1738 would be the lower precedence
Rule here (which I doubt), this still only means that Elde is not Blob
Executor, but not that Elde is not Blob EiP.

Thus I find the Judgement CORRECT.

Andre

I'm interested in these timing issues, especially when things are so
close. Could you please publish some more details on this, like the
headers you used to determine the end of the voting period and the
time at which Crito's vote was cast?

Thank you! Kolja A.

I've expanded on length on how I determine the time that a message is
sent.  Zefram's arguments regarding the use of Received headers are
not supported by the Rules or by Game Custom, but merely by the
misinterpretation of a Judgement he hasn't actually read.

As I've said before, I use the "Date" header, unless it is clearly
incorrect.  Since Crito is both Promotor and Voter in this case, I see
no reason why his own system's date should not be determinative in
this case; any systematic errors would tend to cancel each other out
anyway.

Thanks, that's fine with me. Sorry I didn't remember you had stated
such a clear and definite policy before. I didn't mean to cause you
extra work, it's just that such issues become much more interesting
once you're directly involved in similar decisions (as I am now with
regard to Internomic proposals).

Presence? PRESENCE? Surely Presence of the mind, NOT! Any IDIOT can see
that a GENIUS some I will be a RESOURCEFULLER and better Mad Scientist
than Swann, an ... individual, some has let him be controlled by other

It is NO REASON, why should you do something except to Vote FOR ME some
Mad Scientist. Use your BRAIN. Unless I will find the use for it,

Zombie.

True, there is merit, but IMO, it is more natural to interpret R869 as
establishing a requirement for becoming a Player (a requirement that can be
overridden by precedence) rather than establishing a synonymity between
Playerhood and registration.

I'd support this.  It seems to give the Promotor extra power, but in fact,
anything e does with this has no effect unless the proposals pass.  This would
allows the Promotor the chance to make Repeal-O-Matic proposals more
interesting I think.

Interestingly, because the Chancellor issued the Transfer Orders for

Nothing to welcome.  Read over Proposal 3582 closely.  I suspect that
Rulekeepor Chuck will shortly advise us that Proposal 3582 created no
Rules; Proposal 3582 does not, in fact, state that a Rule is to be
created.  I argue that Proposal 3582 is, in effect, a Null Proposal.

Had I been Wizard when this was distributed, I would have slapped it
down at least 2 Style Points for failing to specify any Rule Changes.
Oh well.

(Reminds me, I need to spit out a Wizard's Report before the end of
the week.)

At first I was inclined to agree with Scott that
Proposal 3582 is null since it does not explicitly
state that it is creating a new rule.  However,
after scanning the Ruleset, I can find no
prescription in there that specifies exactly *how*
a proposal must specify Rule changes.  The first
sentence of the proposal

     This Rule shall be known as the
     Repeal-O-Matic Rule and may be referred to
     unambiguously in that manner.

makes it clear that the text is to be considered a
rule with the title "Repeal-O-Matic".  As there is
no rule with that title, nor any rule with similar
text or intent, I think it would really be
stretching things to say that this proposal does
not unambiguously specify the text of a new rule. 

I imagine Scott would argue that the proposal does
not unambiguously specify what should be *done*
with this new rule and I guess I would not be too
unhappy if that is the consensus of the Players. 
But I think that strains logic a bit much, since
there is nothing one can reasonably expect a
proposal to do with a new rule *except* add it to
the Ruleset.

It unambiguously specifies the text of something that the Proposer
wished to become a Rule.

However, I draw your attention to Rule 1339: "Exact precision is
required in the specification of Rule Changes".  I argue that Proposal
3582 is not nearly exact enough to be taken as a specification of a
Rule Change which creates a new Rule.  Game Custom, further, is
supportive of this position.

I'll let Chuck make a formal determination, and leave it up to the
Courts beyond that.

Oerjan,

It seems to me that you yet retain a bit of sanity in your choice
of capitalization--using all caps for important words.  I suggest you
study the works of various Usenet kooks to get a better feel for
pseudo-random capitalization of words.  :)

No, it makes it clear that we have a Proposal that thinks it
is a Rule.  Which does not make it a Rule.

I do not think it would be stretching things at all.
In the past (although not too recently, as I recall) similar
Proposals have been held not to enact any Rule Changes.

You can't change your vote in an Election, but I see nothing that says
that you cannot vote after you have declared Presence.

The following is the Judgement I intend to enter in CFJ 1071.

======================================================================

This case presents the question of whether the sitting Speaker may be
Nominated in an Election for the Office of Speaker-Elect, on the basis
of Rules 1558 and 1647.  Petitioner presents arguments both for and
against holding such a Nomination as legal.  This Court find that Rule
1558 is ambiguous on the question, but categorically bars such
Nominations on the grounds that failing to categorically bar them
would potentially require future knowledge in order to distinguish
legal Nominations.

This Court finds that the pertinent sentence of Rule 1558, "No Player
may be Nominated who would not be permitted to hold the Office which
the Election is seeking to fill," is insufficiently specified.  There
appear to be two plausible constructions of this sentence.  It could
mean "No Player may be Nominated who would not be permitted to hold
the Office ... _if Elected_."  It could also mean "No Player may be
Nominated who would not be permitted to hold the Office ... _at the
moment of the attempted Nomination_."  The first construction seems
slightly slightly favorable to the second, but not compellingly so.  A
consideration of both is therefore in order.

The first construction would permit the Speaker to Nominate for
Speaker-Elect, as long as the Speaker ensures that e is not Speaker by
the time the Election ends.  Petitioner mentions several possible ways
in which this might happen, but neglects to mention the case of the
Speaker being Tainted.  If the Speaker is Tainted, then, should e be
Elected, e would immediately cease to be Speaker (and then immediately
become Speaker again).  It becomes an argument of infinitesimal
moments as to whether the Speaker would be forced to be Speaker-Elect
simultaneously in this case, an argument this Court will not pursue at
this time.  In any case, the first construction would allow the
Speaker to Nominate for Speaker-Elect in some situations, and would
therefore mandate a ruling of FALSE.

However, this Court elects to repudiate this construction, because it
would, in many cases, make the legality of a Speaker's Nomination
contigent on future events.  Petitioner suggests that the Speaker
could be made eligible by being removed by Proposal, by surrendering
the Speakership, or by going On Hold.  To have the desired effect, one
of these events would necessarily have to occur after the Nomination,
but before the end of the Election.  Most imporatantly, if none of
these were to occur before the end of the Election, the Speaker would
be ineligible to become Speaker-Elect.  Thus, the legality of the
Nomination, and thus of the Nominee's candidacy, would be contingent
on the necessary event occuring.  It is this Court's opinion that
basing the legality of an action on future events is neither
consistent with commonsense nor in keeping with the best interest of
the Game, and so this construction should be disallowed if an
alternative exists.

The second construction, fortunately, is void of this need for
precognition.  The legality of a Nomination, under this construction,
can be determined at the moment it is made.  In this Court's opinion,
this advantage is more than sufficient to outweigh the Court's
admittedly minor concerns about the obviousness of this construction.

Since this Court's preferred construction of Rule 1558 acts to
categorically bar any Nomination by the Speaker in any Election for
the Officer of Speaker-Elect, the question presented is categorically
true.  Therefore:

Judgement of TRUE is entered.  The Injunction requested is GRANTED,
and the Rulekeepor is hereby enjoined to annotate Rule 1558 with the
Statement of this CFJ and the list of Relevant Rules as noted in the
CFJ.

There is prior game custom concerning precisely these situations,
to the effect that a Proposal which does not explicitly say "Enact
a Rule" or some equivalent, does not enact a Rule.

Now that P3581 has passed, and the conspiracy of the Zombiemasters
defeated by the treachery of Morendil (and I say that without the
slightest animosity, only a tinge of sadness), I can finally answer
Zefram's question. Apart from the normal motivation to fix an
annoying bug, I wished to close the loophole which was enabling
Oerjan to keep Maybe Absent Players like Calabresi and Vanyel from
becoming Absent by announcing that they were Absent. If those Players
had become Silent, nothing could have prevented we Zombiemasters from
deregistering them, thus bringing more Zombies under our control and
increasing our power. 

I must say that you really should have figured that out for yourself.

If Elde is Blob's Executor despite not being a Player, then isn't it
true that Morendil has continued to be Elde's Executor through the
period during which Morendil was not a Player, and remains Elde's
Executor at this time?

This is performed improperly.  Aside from the fact that I wish Steve
would be more explicit in specifying the actions e is performing, he
failed to remit unclaimed assets to Mintors as required by Section 7
of the Probate Code.

In addition to my prior comment, such destruction is also improper
because Swann is not a terminal estate, by virtue of having since
reregistered.

There is some question in my mind as to whether this really counts as
'resigning'. That doesn't affect your Judgement, however. Your Judgement
is a good reading of the Rule, but exposes its deficiencies in various
ways. It was never my intention, in writing the current text of R880,
that a Player other than the Speaker come to hold an Office without
having first consented. It is my view that R880 therefore stands in
need of amendment. I'll submit a proto.

Grumble. I have to say, Scott, that the Probate Code is a nasty piece
of work indeed.

Well, I did say '...that I am permitted to destroy as his Executor in
Probate'. You're right, of course, that Swann is not a terminal
estate. This means that your prior remark about my not having
executed transfers in accordance with Section 7 of the Probate Code
is inapplicable, since Section 7 "is skipped if the estate is not
terminal".

I think therefore that my post announcing the termination of Swann's
Probate is both proper and effective.

Proto-Proposal
Resignation and consent

[Comment: Swann's Judgement of CFJ 1069 exposes a flaw in Rule 880:
a Player other than the Speaker can come to hold an Office without
eir consent. I propose to fix this bug. In the process, I've made 
the Rule a lot more explicit about timing.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 880 be amended to read:

      An Officer is always permitted to resign from any Office e
      holds, provided e appoints another Player to succeed em. An
      Officer who resigns without appointing a successor is deemed
      to have appointed the Speaker to succeed em.

      The Speaker can be appointed to hold an Office temporarily
      without consenting, and may not refuse such an appointment.
      If the Speaker is appointed, e becomes the new holder of the
      Office at the time of the resignation.

      If the appointed Player is not the Speaker, e does not become
      the new holder of the Office unless e explicitly consents to
      the appointment in the Public Forum in the seven days immediately 
      before or after the resignation. If e does so consent, e
      becomes the new holder of the Office either at the time of the
      resignation, or at the time of eir consent, whichever is latest.  

      If the appointed Player does not consent, and seven days have
      passed since the resignation, and the resigning Officer is still
      holding the Office, the Speaker becomes the new holder of the
      Office.

      A change in the identity of the Speaker does not automatically
      cause the transfer of any Offices being held by the former
      Speaker to the new Speaker.

Well, I accept that I deserved the transfer: I was slack. Nevertheless,
I passed no duties on to various Recordkeepors that would not have been
imposed on them anyway. In order to execute Probate conscientiously,
which I have now resolved to do, I've had to make requests for information
to all the Recordkeepors in order to discover Swann's current assets,
credits and debts. So they'll have to do the exact same work anyway.

If you're preopared to list approximate dates, my approximate date of
registration would be July 1994.

I will, of course, acceed to game custom and the consensus of other Players,
although I'm left with a slight uneasiness that we tend to take literal
interpretations of things too far.  I doubt if Proposals think they are
anything at all.  8)  I am comfortable with the idea that 'exact precision' is
to be interpreted as meaning that a proposal must state explicitly whther it
adds, amends, or repeals a Rule.  Besides, this is easily resolved, if Swann so
desires.

Crito would have had to determine which Payment Orders, out of however
many there might presently be, you were permitted to vacate, instead
of merely checking to see if the Orders you specifically have named
need to be vacated.  Not a great deal of buckpassing, but it is
buckpassing.

I am more concerned that someone might follow your cue and do "I
hereby execute Payment Orders and Transfer Orders sufficient to carry
out X's Probate."  This would be a complete passing of the buck.  In
order to forestall someone else from doing this, I feel I must object
to the lesser form vigorously.  (I have a proto pending which will allow
a Recordkeepor to refuse to record Transfer Orders and Payment Orders
which are not concisely and precisely specified, by the way; should
appear later tonight.)

I'll post a mass Probate Report to the PF shortly, listing all
VT-related matters for those Entities which are presently in Probate.
