I presumed that the Chancellor would set a reasonable policy, such as
selling Bank-owned Plots for a certain number of other Currencies.

Oh, boy.

And not, for example, give emself 34 Plots, thus winning by Monopoly?

I should have included Time Agent's actual message, which said in part:

Note that he uses the singular "injunction" and not the plural form.  I
take this as meaning that he issues the entire paragraph as a single
injunction, and it should be interpreted this way unless there is clear and
convincing evidence to the contrary.

I see a third possibility:  "possible but punishable and reversible".  For
many things, this would be just as good as "impossible".

There is a presumption that one Injunction is meant to be issued,
I'll readily grant that.

However, I cannot honestly accept that "The 10 VT PO shall be vacated
by the Registrar, and any other rewards shall be canceled" should
count as only one Injunction. The first part names one Player and
requires an action which one specific Rule states may be ordered as
part of an Injunction. The second part does neither, and I am very 
much inclined to think that this is clear and convincing evidence 
that the first order issued is a separate Injunction.

Having granted that, it seems logical to interpret the latter part of
the order as a separate Injunction, since it does attempt to require
some (underspecified) actions of some (underspecified) set of
Players. Then again, the specification is so vague that we might not 
consider this to properly be an 'order' at all.

I suugest we vote down 'Plots', so that it can be reproposed in a form

     This is true.  The only part of it I meant as an injunction was
the sentence that contains all the components of an injunction --
namely, the vacating of the PO.  The last sentence, while vague, was
meant as a clean-up, reminding the Players of the actions that would
likely occur if my judgment were to be upheld.

     Well, that's not exactly a correct quotation.  They were two
separate sentences.  The first part is the actual Injunction, and the
second is the consequences of the reversal of the win. 
     I'll grant that I should have only declared the actual
Injunction in the Injunction paragraph and left the other comments to
be placed elsewhere.

     I think this is clear and convincing evidence that the second
part is not an Injunction at all.

In other words, it would appear, even to you, that the evidence that 
the latter sentence was not meant as an Injunction is inconsistent : 
that is, the heading 'Injunction', in the singular, suggests one 
single Injunction, whereas the inclusion of additional material in 
that same paragraph could suggest otherwise.

Under the circumstances, I think you will agree that one must turn 
elsewhere for evidence that is more conclusive ?

 I don't agree, but I will grant that the wording of that latter part 
is not necessarily explicit enough to be interpreted as an order. I 
would say that there is no clear-cut indication as to whether that 
additional comment, or reminder, should be interpreted as an 
Injunction. But Judicial precedent in this matter seems to be that in 
such matters, the least lenient interpretation is to be chosen. And 
believe me, I know what I'm talking about. ;)

I'm afraid you can't have your cake and eat it too. ;)

For a command issued in a Judgement to be effective in imposing a
requirements on Players, it must be an Injunction, and conversely,
something of the sort that is not an Injunction has no coercive power
on any Player. I don't think any further effect of a Judgement is to
be expected as a result of issuing a 'reminder'.
