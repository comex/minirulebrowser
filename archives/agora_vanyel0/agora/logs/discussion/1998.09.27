This was sent the second time after the Nominating period had
finished.  If we'd seen it the first time, it would have been in
time.  It seems to me that the nomination for Notary is invalid.
Sorry. 

Do nominate when I call for nominations again, which I will do
shortly. 

Michael.

I'm not convinced that an Election for Registrar is currently being
conducted. It seems to me that Murphy called for Nominations on Sep 18,
even though we didn't receive the message until yesterday. The
Nominating Period has therefore concluded. Since Murphy's message of
yesterday stated that he called for Nominations if and only if he had
not already done so, and he *had* already done so on Sep 18, his message
of yesterday did not recommence the Election for Registrar.

The last of these POs was mistaken and should have named me as Payor.
Kolja jas already admitted this to me privately, but I'm still waiting
for a public admission. At any rate, a reversing order for POP330 will
eventually have to be issued.
