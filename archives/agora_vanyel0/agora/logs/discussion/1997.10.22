It's at least three characters different!  It's as close as "Slave",
for example.

Anyway, I much prefer "Noisy".  All credit to Agoraphobe Bethmo.

I believe one hour.  I'd blame Kolja's clock; probably a timezone

Remember, an Injunction is "a statement ordering one or more Players
to perform or to restrain from performing one or more actions". My
post included a minimum of four such statements; what we are trying
to determine is whether these four statements are, in the eyes of
the law, better interpreted as implying a larger number of statements
legally equivalent to one Injunction.

If I were to write "All Officers are hereby ordered to transfer one
VT to the Bank", this single statement could legally be interpreted
as equivalent to as many Payment Orders as there are Officers; it is
in this manner that the statements included in my Judgement of 1045
could be interpreted to convey more than four Injunctions.

However, I could just as well have written, "I hereby issue a Payment
Order requiring all Officers to transfer one VT to the Bank". This
would not necessarily have the effect that only one PO was executed
thereby, because such a statement seeks to impose an obligation on
more than one Player, and therefore would in all probability be
deemed to comprise multiple Payment Orders. Conversely, a sentence
such as "I hereby issue Payment Orders requiring Steve to pay 5 VTs
to the Bank" would in all likelihood be interpreted as one Payment
Order, rather than, say, a total of 5 POs for one VT each.

What I am getting at is that for a statement which seeks to place an
obligation on some Player or Players, and at the same time contains
some allegation as to the nature or number of the obligation or
obligations it places, the fact that the allegation may be
misleading, or false, does not necessarily alter the effects of the
part of the statement that is characteristically an "order".

Not quite.  Instructions to majordomo are identified by having been sent
to majordomo@, rather than to a list address.  What's it's trapping are
apparent adminstrative requests that were sent to the list (in error,
it believes).  Turning the trapping off completely shouldn't result in
any junk going to the list; the only admin requests we'll see on the
lists are the ones that were sent to the wrong address.

None.  But there is harm in having functionally dead nomics imposing
obligations on Players that have lost their right to deregister,
which is a serious possibility with some experiments we might attempt.
Of course, in practice we'll just ignore any such obligations; this is
where a Formalist Ruleset is obviously preferable to a Jurist one.

Good point. The trouble is, I see nothing in the list config file that
tells me how to turn the trapping off.

No third insistence is required.  My insistence alone is sufficient,

I know about that - I thought that the effect of turning it off would
be to forward all messages which I currently receive as administrator, 
including notifications of s-bscriptions and uns-bscriptions to the list.

At any rate, we can see for ourselves: I've just turned it off on all three
lists.

How far in the future? Is Kolja's clock wrong? Gecko is running slow,
not fast.

I don't think the clock on my computer is wrong by one hour. Maybe
something with the translation between national conventions for

Anyway, I take it that the only time stamps of legal significance for

There's a big difference: at present, the Mad Scientist cannot make the
Frankenstein Monster an Office again, because that provision was once
a part of the Rule, even though it has now been deleted. The amendment
blocks only those amendments which are substanitally the same as some
existing part of the FM.

I am dubious of the received stamp principle in general, and am rather
certain that it has limited or no applicability to messages which are
not required to be sent to the Public Forum.  In any case, in my
opinion, the error does not invalidate your message; I merely
determined what I believe to be the correct time on the basis of the
available evidence, and recorded that.

(I believe that CFJs 707 and 831 are based on an inadequate
understanding of the principles of evidence, but that's another issue

True.  That particular Received: stamp only applies to messages reaching
the PF (CFJ 707 states that the message reaches the PF when it reaches
the listserver, which is what that timestamp records).  For messages
reaching individuals, the message becomes effective when it comes into
the recepient's "normal technical domain of control" (I forget the CFJ
number), which will normally be recorded in a different Received: line.
But recall that another CFJ states that sending a message to the PF is
sufficient to fulfill a requirement to send it to a particular Player,
so in that case the message becomes effective when it reaches the
listserver, rather than when it reaches the Player's normal technical
domain of control.

You're reaching.  All Oerjan's Judgement stated is that a message is
"received" when it enters the normal technical domain of control; his
judgement said nothing of the _timing_ of that message.

I consider the date of execution of a message to be the time at which
it was sent, not the time at which it was received in any particular
place.  The various stamps are appropriate evidence to be used in
determining when that date is.

Note that if you argue the other way around, I can prevent everyone
from voting by disabling my mail pickup for the duration of the Voting
Period of a Proposal.  Should I do that, the messages will not enter
my normal technical domain of control during the Voting Period, and
thus will not be Votes.

CFJ 707 was called to resolve a case where a message to the PF was
delayed in delivery several days, during which time a duplicate
message was sent to the backup forum.  CFJ 707 holds that the
later-sent, but earlier-distributed, message is the message with legal
significance.  It is, in my opinion, unwarranted reaching to extend
CFJ 707's precedent beyond that situation.  CFJ 707 is not about
timing at all, but about ordering.  And all CFJ 831 states is that the
"Date" header may be wrong.

In my opinion, neither of these CFJs either mandates or justifies
systematically taking any particular "Received" header as wholly
determinative of the date at which a message was sent; rather, the
"Date" header as well as the "Received" headers are all evidence to be
used by a finder of fact in determining the time at which the message
was actually sent, with the "Date" header naturally being given
preference (subject to the judicial notice in CFJ 831 that "Date"
headers may be wrong).

There we disagree.  If a message must be sent *to the PF* to take effect,
it can't take effect until it does actually reach the PF.  The same
applies to sending a message to an individual.

If Judging a CFJ on such an occurrence, I would judge that the messages
had in fact entered your normal technical domain of control.  You would,
after all, be exterting control over the messages -- if you happen to
be turning the messages back, rather than accepting them, that doesn't
change the fact that you had control over the process.

So you're saying that two messages can take effect in a different order
from the temporal order in which they take effect?

Technically speaking, the Date: header is very poor indication of when a
message was sent.  (It's pretty poor indication of anything, actually.)
The time the message entered the mail transport system is normally
indicated by the *first* Received: line (added by the MTA having received
the message from the user).  But I'd rather not get into a debate about
the definition of `sent'; reception is so much more clear-cut.

The case law is that it doesn't take effect unless it reaches the PF,
and if two copies reach the PF, the date at which the first such
message to reach the PF was sent is the date at which that message is
effective, even if other copies were sent earlier.  In my opinion, the
informal annotation in the Full Ruleset misrepresents the import of
CFJ 707.

No, I am not saying that at all.

There was a CFJ some time back that clearly established the time of
sending as determinative, and not the time of receipt.  It involved a
Vote sent prior to the end of the Voting Period, but not received
until after.  The Vote was adjudged legal.  I don't remember the CFJ.

As far as the unreliability of the "Date" header, yes, it is possible
to spoof the Date header or for it to be inaccurate.  But it is
equally possible for any or even most of the "Received" headers to
also be inaccurate.  Furthermore, spoofing "Date" headers would be
both dishonorable and malicious, and likely to earn the spoofer a
great deal of ire.  And the cases of inaccuracy have been relatively
infrequent and generally easy to detect.

Then again, I think again we are seeing the difference between the
approach of a legislator and a mathematician.  You want a rule that
works in all cases, even if it doesn't always work all that well.  I
want a rule that works well in most cases, leaving the cases where it
does not work to judges to resolve.

I like it because it obviates the implicit requirement of keeping
track of past amendments, which is currently necessary but not
required of any Player (except inasmuch as the Archivist is requried

Let's see... suppose we have two messages M1 and M2.  These perform
interdependent actions, and need to be sent to the PF to take effect.
They travel thus:

    sent        reached PF
M1  10:00:00    11:00:00
M2  10:05:00    10:55:00

By CFJ 707, the one that reaches the PF first (M2) takes effect first.
You argue that the messages take effect when they are sent, by which
reasoning M1 clearly takes effect first.  What *are* you saying?

Yes, but Received: headers tend to be more accurate, and the Date:
header is not necessarily added at the time of sending anyway.
Deliberate spoofing is a completely different issue.

At least, the ones that have been detected have been.

Possibly.  I think the mathematical view has greater support in the
Ruleset -- the CFJ Rules make it clear that a Judge does not affect what
is true, but merely investigates a preexisting truth.  I also dispute
that (in this case) the system I am advocating works any less well than
your system.  Quite the reverse, in fact.

Go read CFJ 707.  Maybe then you'll see why it's not generalizable;
there were a number of unusual circumstances that came together in
that CFJ, the most important of which is that the message involved was
sent to the Public Forum twice.  (I don't consider a message sent
twice to take effect twice; only the first sending has legal effect.)

Andrew> At least, the ones that have been detected have been.

And the ones that have not been detected are legally irrelevant.
Findings of fact are necessarily constrained by that which is knowable
or reasonably deducible.  In many cases, the actual time of
transmission is unknowable, so we must necessarily make a best
approximation using the evidence at hand.  I hold that the "Date"
header should have primacy in making that approximation, since in most
cases it is the datum most closely associated with the moment of
actual transmission.

I don't see how that's implied at all in the CFJ rules, and I believe
that your thesis is, in fact, disfavored, at least with respect to
matters of law.  Clearly Judges are often presented with "hard cases"
(to borrow from Dworkin) where no clearly-favored "truth" exists.  I
do agree that, with respect to matters of fact, Judges are constrained
to investigate only the preexisting truthfulness of those allegations
of fact.  But most CFJs hinge not on allegations of fact, but on
allegations of law, so much so that Agora has very little experience
in dealing with contested allegations of fact.

The Platonic model works fine as long as the uncertainty level remains
low.  The problem is in keeping the uncertainty level sufficiently
low; history has shown that doing so is difficult.

Ah, here's the root of our disagreement.  I would consider it to be
two messages.  (From the point of view of the emal system, I believe in
that case it most definitely was two messages.)  Of course, if it was
legally only one message, sent twice, then it's meaningless to say which
copy of it takes effect -- it is the message itself that takes effect.

It's not, technically.  The first Received: header is closer.  But we
could spend all day debating the meaning of `transmission' in this
context.

I didn't think we were debating that.  Weren't we just debating when a
message sent to the PF takes effect?

Well, the problem arises when there is doubt whether Mr. Shirinovsky is a
Player. This places burden of discovery on the Recordkeepor.

A possible solution would be to place such entities in Probate.

Re: BUS: Re: OFF: CFJ 1060 Assignment: General Chaos

This is the one where Ross, after having been re-registered by Harlequin acting
as Antimatter's EiP, transferred said Kudo and then promptly deregistered.  The
issue at law is whether persons who have an EiP are deprived of the ability to
perform actions allowed by the rules, specifically Kudo transfers in this case,
because they are no longer their own Executor.

Could someone please refresh my memory as to the circumstances of this
CFJ?  Briefs on the issues of law would also be appreciated.

Amending a Rule by quoting the text to be replaced tends to be safer than
relying on placement within the Rule, in case some other Proposal (or the
Virus) amends the Rule before your Proposal takes effect.

It is my belief that even if this Proposal should pass (I for one am not
voting FOR it) it will have no effect due to Rule 1698.

Indeed.  No true hacker even acknowledges the existence of an ISO
standard, let alone agrees to abide by it, except under threat of
grave personal injury (or being denied Chinese food).

I think that questions as to Mr. Shirinovsky's status as a Player are
beside the point. At the moment, I can transfer a VT to another VT, or
to the Virus. or to the Frankenstein Monster, or to R101, or to the
Stasis Chamber, or to a Kudo, and on and on. In my opinion, this kind
of thing should not be possible.

How are you going to place any of the entities on the above list

I thought the Caller's argument's would have been sufficient to refresh
your memory on that score. The CFJ has to do with what powers a Player
who is not eir own Executor has to act on eir own behalf. I think 3
positions have been defended:

1. A Player who is not eir own Executor can do anything that a Player
who is eir own Executor can do. The Player is emself, and is thus
empowered to do anything that Players can do (the no Zombie theory).

2. The Rules distinguish between things Executors can do and things
Players can do, and a Player who is not eir own Executor can do only
the latter but not the former things (the partial Zombie theory).

3. A Player who is not eir own Executor can do nothing of legal
significance. Only the Player's Executor has the right to act on
eir behalf (the complete Zombie theory).

If memory serves, you had expressed a preference for (2). But you may
have changed your mind - you've done it before :)

If it passed, it would have Power 3.1 and so take precedence over R1698.
