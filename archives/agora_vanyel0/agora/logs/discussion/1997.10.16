Perhaps not, but they were enacted by the Electorate without
substantial objection quite a long time ago.  Apparently a majority of
Players want them, whether or not they're useful.

The Probate rule prohibits the destruction of any entity which
possesses Currencies.  Hence, when a Group is to be dissolved while it
still possesses Currencies, it instead enters Probate, and its
Currencies are disposed of by nonretrospective transfers executed by
its Executor in Probate.  Then, and only then, is the dissolved Group
actually "destroyed".

If called upon to consider the appropriateness of this Injunction,
I certainly would have such a generous remuneration inappropriate.
Having some connection to the situation at hand is a necessary, but
not sufficient, condition on being appropriate. I might well have 
judged *any* remuneration by Injunction, for that matter. on the
grounds that the appropriate means of addressing the situation
that CotC is underpaid is through legislation, not Injunctive
handouts.

And I might agree with you, on the grounds that it is inappropriate
to annotate a Rule with what is effectively a restatement of its text
which sheds no interpretative light on the Rule of any kind.

R1652 refers to the penalties for Crimes and Infractions, which
in my view more or less forces the reading that it refers to
legal acts and not merely to natural acts.

So, you must interpret R1478's provision that Players are usually
their own Executors as vacuous. Nothing wrong with that, I suppose,
but my view is different. I agree with Scott and Crito that where
the Rules say an action is to be performed by an Executor, only the
Executor may do it. Where the Rules say that a Player may perform
some action, then both the Player and the Execturo may do it.

However, this doesn't respond to Chuck's argument that if the Player
can't do it, then neither can the Executor, since the Executor is
acting as if e were the Player.

Note that this includes a transfer of 1 VT to yourself, which is, I

Wouldn't it be more intuitive to include becoming Maybe Absent, or
becoming Absent, as transitions, in the sense that their dates
should be recorded in the transition column?

To my mind, the problem with the Probate rules as they stand is that
they pretend that the Player still exists, when in fact, they are
effectively dead.  Rather than make the EiP the Player's Executor,
which thereby allows the EiP to do all sorts of silly things while in
control of a Player-like entity, the Notary should make the EiP the
Execuctor of the Player's Estate.  Estates are not Players so can't
get up to silly games like being re-registered.

I therefore believe that R1601 should be reworded along the lines of 

  "No entity may be destroyed while it possesses any units of
   Currency; if an entity which possesses units of Currency would

Alternatively, rather than have to-be-destroyed entities become
Estates, you could let the old entity be destroyed, and then transfer
its currencies to a new Estate of X entity.  The (slight) problem with
this is that this transfer has to happen in a way that bypasses normal
TO/PO rules..  This might be seen as something of a slight
difficulty.

The Rule-mandated transition date is that of registration or Hold
status change.  I'd rather not start listing Absence changes in the same
form, as it's a completely broken system.  Now that we have a working
Proposal system, I'll Propose something I've been planning for a while:
the Registrar's Report should contain the date of last registration *and*
the last Hold status change, separately.  Absence changes should also be
listed separately.  But as this change would require the Registrar to
go searching through a lot of old logs to find out registration dates,
I'll postpone Proposing it until I've actually done the research.

Btw, does anyone have a copy of Vanyel's PF logs?  I was negotiating
taking a complete copy from him just when he disappeared.

Nope.  Alleging that e has Abandoned makes em Maybe Absent -- so e
is now no longer Absent.  Congratulations, you've found a bug in the
Absence Rule.  What you wanted to do, and now can't do for another two
weeks, is to make em Abandoning, which would cause deregistration.

The opposite interpretation can be justified by arguing that 1652
aims precisely to introduce a distinction between legal acts and
natural acts, and insofar as penalties are concerned states that
only the latter should be considered. Here's how :

There are two ways to read 1652; one is that it seeks to prevent a
Player who e.g. has been determined by a CFJ to be guilty of a
particular Crime, and has been appropriately penalized, to be
penalized again if a further CFJ alleging that e has committed the
same Crime is again Judged TRUE, which is a definite possiblity.
Call this the 'weak' version of Double Jeopardy. 

A broader reading would interpret 1652 as seeking to prevent
multiple penalties from being applied to a Player for a single act,
or failure to act. Call this the 'strong' version Double Jeopardy.

As a hypothetical example, imagine that the Assessor deliberately
misrepresents in eir Report the number of Votes cast on a certain
Proposal. This constitutes two distinct 'legal acts'; one has the
effect of informing the Players of certain facts about the current
Game State, and the Assessor's deliberate misinformation constitutes
the Crime of Misrepresentation. In addition, the same Report is also
directly useful to various Officers, chiefly the Rulekeepor, in
preparing their own publications; thus the Assessor's deliberate
misinformation constitutes the Crime of Falsification. 

In the 'weak' version, the Assessor could incur the penalties for
both Crimes (but, of course, only once for each). In the 'strong'
version, the Assessor would only incur the penalties for
Misrepresentation of Falsification, depending, I suppose, on which of
them e were tried for first (indeed, this would have the interesting
consequence that a Player committing such a deed would serve eir own
interests best by emself submitting a CFJ stating that e had
committed the lesser Crime !) 

I am not aware of any Game Custom involving 1652, so I suppose that 
it would be up to the Courts to reach a decision as to which version 
1652 implements.

After infection by the virus, 1467 reads:
>>
Rule 1467/3 (Power=1)
Definition of a Currency

      There are certain entities which are Currencies.  An entity is a
      Currency if and only if it has been made such by the Rules, and
      if and only if it complies with all the requirements in the
      Rules pertaining to Currencies.

      Neither Currencies nor units of Currency shall be created or
      destroyed except as specified by the Rules.

      This Rule, apart from this paragraph, shall be completely
      without effect. Two weeks after this paragraph is inserted into
      this Rule, this paragraph shall be deleted from this Rule.
<<

Does that mean that for some time everyone can create units of any
currency? 

Of course, the first paragraph of 1471 describes one way to create
units of currency. But as the second paragraph of 1467 without effect,
other ways are not exluded, are they? 1471 does not say that it
describes the _only_ way to do it.

I expect that some of you will now raise the old distinction of
"illegal" vs "impossible", but if ways to create or destroy currency
are limited to ways explicitly stated in the rules, the second
paragraph of 1467 is completely redundant.

If it _is_ possible to create new VTs, say (something I'd really like
to do), we arrive at another interesting question: where do they go
right after their creation? 1471 explicitly says something about this
for units created by the currency's mintor, but if I, say, created
some now, I'm not sure who wouold have them.

Wasn't the point of this to remove the requirement for unanimity when reversing

Shooting from the hip, I tend to think that the phrase "as if e was that
entity" extends the power of the Executor beyond those that the Rules
explicitly specify for the Executor to those powers which the Rules give to the
Player in general.  I do not read it as limiting the Executor to *only* those
things that the Player can do.  Under normal circumstances, this is a
distinction without a difference.

Note, however, that Rule 1497 specifically bars prosecution for both

I don't think this mail is effective. I think it would be effective

The statement that Players are usually their own Executor is not
vacuous because of the fact that the Rules vest certain powers in
Executors.  Without this statement, Players would be unable to
exercise those powers.

However, I believe the claim that Players are their own Executors is
mainly intended for completeness, and to shorten some Rules.

Players do continue to exist after deregistration, of course; it is

I am beginning to think that the latter is a more reasonable
approach.  I also think we need to be very careful about the use of
the term "destroyed", especially when talking about deregistered
Players.

I always thought there was something a bit screwy about the terminology
you introduced into R1042, and now I know what it is: to make a Player
Abandoning, you do not allege that e has Abandoned the game. Highly
counter-intuitive.

####
Proto-Proposal
Straighten out Absence

[Comment: the terminology in R1042 has somehow gotten all twisted
up. I think this straightens it out.]

Be it hereby resolved that R1042 be amended to read:

      Each Player is exactly one of Active, Quiet or Absent. 
      Whenever a Player posts to the Public Forum, or a new Player
      registers, e becomes Active.

      If a Player posts to the Public Forum clearly identifying a
      particular Active Player, and alleging that that Player is
      Quiet, then that Player becomes Quiet. If a Player has been
      Quiet continuously for two weeks, e becomes Absent.  If a
      Player has been On Hold continuously for sixty days, e becomes
      Absent.

      Any Player can cause an Absent Player to become Abandoning by
      stating in the Public Forum that the Absent Player has
      Abandoned the game.

      If the Speaker ever becomes Abandoning, e commits the Class A
      Crime of Speaker Abandonment, e ceases to be Speaker, and the
      Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker.

      If any Player becomes Abandoning, e is deregistered, and the
      Registrar shall announce this in the Public Forum as soon as
      possible.

Strong agreement. I like Michael's suggestion of Estates too. 
You'd probably want to distinguish between Players and other
entities that can possess Currencies (or other items). Something
like: "When a Player possessing Currencies is deregistered, or
an entity possessing Currencies ceases to exist, its possessions
are transferred to the Estate of that Player or entity." I'm not
sure how seriously to take the problem that these transfers don't
sit well with the PC paradigm. If it a serious problem, I'm not
sure exactly how to solve it.

How could the use of the plural form 'Injunctions' possibly be used
to indicate that there was more than Order? As you yourself point out,
R663 allows a single Injunction to require the issuing of more than
one Order. Morendil could have issued a single Injunction applying to
all the Officers, requiring them make multiple POs. All he needed to
have to have done was to say:

      I hereby issue an Injunction, applying to each current Officer,
      requiring them issue Payment Orders of such-and-such a kind.

But that's not what he did. Your first observation was the correct one:
the fact that Morendil used the plural form 'Injunctions' must be taken
to indicate that there is one Injunction for each current Officer who
meets the description.

The last paragraph is distinctly *not* like the other three, in that
it does not use the construction "for each ucrrent Officer".

"...Injunctions, applying to the Registrar, requiring em to issue,
for each Player..." is very clearly one Injunction for each Player.

I don't see how you can possibly read this as only one Injunction.

In light of these errors, I hereby call for the Appeal of CFJ 1055.
