<amplificiation>
The period to which Chuck refers was just after one of the many rounds
of Chromatic Repeals (in which some wit decides to propose that all of
the Rules, or most of the Rules, or some large subset of the Rules,
be repealed) that game has periodically undergone. This particular
round seems to wipe out Rules more or less at random, producing the
Swiss Cheese effect.

Say, we haven't had a round of Chromatic Repeals in a while, have we? ;>

A 2D representation of a cube, something like this:

                                   *
                                  /|\
                                 / | \
                                /  |  \
                               /   |   \
                              /    |    \
                             *     *     *
                             |    / \    |
                             |   /   \   |
                             |  /     \  |
                             | /       \ |
                             |/         \|
                             *           *
                              \         /
                               \       /
                                \     /
                                 \   /
                                  \ /
                                   *

With a bit of squinting and mental juggling, you should be able to
make the middle asterisk of the only line with 3 asterisks on it
appear to you either as the vertex closest to you of a solid cube
seen from below, or as the vertex furthest from you of a hollow cube
into which you're looking from above (I'm actually having some
difficulty seeing the figure in this second way). This mental
operation of switching back and forth between the two views is called
the 'Necker flip'. It's similar to the famous vase/two faces picture.

I just copied the list of yoyo s-bscribers, and sent a single message
to majordomo@gecko to manually s-bscribe everyone on that list to the
new lists. But you'd already s-bscribed to the new lists with your new
address, and evidently you hadn't changed your old address on the yoyo
lists.

Well, that's one way to go about it. The other is to pass a Rule
defining what "made available" means in Agora, just as we have a Rule
which defines what "as soon as possible" means in Agora. Then we
could determine whether some document has been made available in law
by seeing if it satisfies the legal definition of having been made
available. We wouldn't then have to worry about whether the document
had been made available in fact. In the same way, we don't worry,
when determining if some action has been performed as soon as possible,
whether it was in fact performed as soon as possible. If it meets the
ordering requirement in R1023 and was performed with a week, then it
was performed ASAP. End of story.

Of course, we'd want whatever definition of "made available" we gave
in the Rule to conform reasonably closely to our intuitive idea of
what being made available means in fact.

Giving a definition of a legal fiction is no easy matter. Lon Fuller
devotes the first third of his book _Legal Fictions_ (Stanford
University Press, 1967) to this question, distinguishing fictions
from false statements, from true statements, from erroneous
conclusions, and from metaphors. Bearing in mind the difficulty
of the matter, then, allow me to essay this very rough attempt: a
legal fiction exists when some state of affairs is granted a
significance in law that it would not ordinarily have in fact. Thus,
R1527 creates a legal fiction that several moves ('communications in
which the Rules place some legal significance') which are actually
sent in a single message, are sent sequentially, separated by
infinitesimal increments of time. Similarly, R880 creates a legal
fiction to the effect that an Officer who has in fact resigned
without appointing a successor, has appointed the Speaker to succeed
em.

As I use the terms, 'legal deeming' is just the practice of creating
legal fictions by whatever means.

Capitalization is a vexed issue, and examples from Agoran history could
be provided in support of either position: that it doesn't matter, or
that it does. Swann, for instance, has the habit, which I find highly
irritating, of capitalizing "as soon as possible", which habit has
regrettably infected Zefram also, and this quirk found its way into
several Rules authored by them (of which R1042/6 and R1036/6, both due
to Zefram, are the only surviving examples), presumably without
affecting the application of those Rules or their relationship to R1023.
On the other hand, we have Eljefe's Judgement (at least, I think it was
his, and I don't have it on hand to check) that 'Extra Votes', the Currency,
were to be distinguished from 'extra votes', ie additional votes
beyond one's first vote which could be cast on a Proposal. Basically,
my view on capitalization is that no consistent overall view as to its
legal significance can be taken, due to the plethora of mutually 
inconsistent practices and conventions adopted by different Agorans
at different times in our history. An argument that relied purely on
the legal significance of capitalization would be on pretty shaky
ground, in my opinion.

But my view on Locations (which you have understood correctly) doesn't
rely on the legal significance of capitalization. The reason that I
think that Locations are completely unrelated to locations is that
they play a role nothing like locations play in our lives. The name
'Location' is too completely metaphorical for it to be confused with
the real thing. Its capitalization is merely a graphological marker
this fact, its use in this fashion being just another of the many
conventions concerning capitalization that Players have adopted.

This is true, but the ASAP rule is a bad example, I think, since it defines a
specific and objective fact - posting a response within one week.  The response
either occurs within the length of time or it doesn't.  Determination of
whether something was done ASAP is unambiguous in fact and in law in this case,
once everyone agrees on what a reasonable length of time is for ASAP.

And this was my point.  You can create a legal definition that amkes it easy to
determine whether something has been "made available" according to that
definition, but you can only get "reasonably" close to "made available" in
fact.  You will always be able to contrive some sequence of events where most
reasonable people would agree that something had not, in fact, been available
even though it fits the legal definition.  I don't see the need to make a
"legal fiction" for this.  Let someone allege that something was not made
available (seems like a very rare occurrance) giving whatever evidence they
have for whatever contrived set of circumstances and then let the courts
decide.  I think this will get closer to the intuitive idea than any definition
(of course, the courts can always make mistakes).

Actually, I realize the ASAP rule is not really a bad example, since you can
come up with contrived circumstances where someone can claim, no matter what
legal length of time was specified, that it just wasn't possible for them to
respond in that time.  However, the frequency of ASAP events, plus the need to
actually *extend* the legal time limit for ASAP (as opposed to the common
definition of it), makes this a good candidate for using a legal definition.  I
don't think these apply to the "made available" situation.

I see, I forgot that there is no Abstention, so that Present is actually
useful even if Votes are free.

However, my sympathy is limited. If Officers were so worried about having
to dig back into their records, then they should at least Propose
Ratifications now and then. On the contrary, this is almost never done.

But I am not unwilling to help with what limited records I have:

The Wizard Election ended at 24 July with Kolja A. declaring Presence.
Quorum 8, 9 Players Voted, no problem.

You also don't have to bother with non-Registrar Elections while you were
simultaneously Assessor and Registrar, which I think that you were for
most of the previous year.

I suppose if there actually were close calls on some other Elections, one
would have to check whether the declarations were sent to the Public
Forum. 

Greetings,
Ørjan.

I thought they more or less stopped when we put into place penalties for
Proposing a large number of Proposals.

Now we have Disinterested Proposals and so it is feasible to Propose them,
but on the other hand it is very expensive to Vote on them.

"Legal deeming" refers to the practice of law treating something as if it possessed a certain 
property when it does not. An example from our Rules: a Player who declares eirself Present on a 
proposal is treated for purposes of quorum as if e had voted on that proposal, when indeed e had 
not. It is generally agreed that, while deeming limited to a specific instance is sometimes 
needed, global deeming (i.e. saying that something is deemed to be true for *all* circumstances) 
is only useful when used to contradict a physical reality.

It's probably a good idea to use as few "synonyms" as possible, though, because the rule 
interpretation *is* picky and something too dissimilar would probably not be accepted.

Half of Xanadu was female, I believe. As for Kelly, I've known a number (well, two or three) male 
Kellys, so I no longer think of it as a female-only name, although I still haven't met a male 
Kelli. 

And, hmmm, I wonder, why is that (that there are no female players?) I haven't seen any in any of 
my (albeit limited) Nomic experience.

The Cartographor is reminded that agora-discussion is not a Public Forum,
and so he has not yet responded properly to the Claim.
