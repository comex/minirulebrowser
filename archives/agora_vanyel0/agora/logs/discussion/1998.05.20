No doubt they were wiped out by one or another of the various "Year
Zero" proposals we seem prone to.   With a bit of luck the Levers of
MP proposal will help remove the need for this sort of violent
fluctuation, and things will settle down a bit.

There will be a Plot repair proposal in next week's batch. This will
probably generate more than enough currency for the unemployed.  

Incidentally, I like Kolja's proposal to make Plot-holding
incompatible with Office holding.  I suggest that Officers will likely
respond by attempting to hold land indirectly through proxies, but
this should be an interesting opportunity for politicking. 

Another idea: why not pay Officer salaries out of revenue generated by
Plots?  Either we tax Player incomes, or perhaps somehow generate
central income our of unheld land, but either way this makes the
Chancellor's job slightly more interesting.  (The influence on them to
keep things balanced is much more direct.)

Go on then, what are the words to the US anthem? 

Incidentally, in case you were wondering, the NZ's anthem's first
verse is:

God of Nations! At Thy feet,
In the bonds of love we meet,
Hear our voices we entreat,
God protect our free land
Guard Pacific's triple star
>From the shafts of strife and war
Make her praises heard afar
God defend New Zealand.

There are four more verses, and Maori versions of them all as well.

I checked some official sources, and it seems the God Save the Queen
(the British anthem) is still a valid national anthem in NZ as well.

Michael.

Hi all,

Unfortunately I've seen Blob's P-note offer too late. But I would
still like to buy P-notes - I would offer to pay 2 VTs for one P-note,
or 1 indulgence for 2 P-notes. 

Anyone interested?

Twenty five Proposals in the Queue! Perhaps we should give the Promotor
some latitude to choose Batch Sizes larger than 6?
<<

But a long Proposal quese means that the concept is working! Why
dilute it as soon as it gets going? We now have what we wanted: a
situation where P-notes are so scarce (_and_ so important) that people
really have to trade for them.

BTW, a lot of the proposals in the queue are really minor changes,
including 5 ROM proposals noone seems to be very excited about.

Of course there is the question of balancing P-note demand (larger with a
small batch size) and VT expenditure (larger for larger batches) and
the question how minor fixes can be passed if they are continually
overtaken by more important proposals. But I'd really tackle these
problems in their own right and not simply by reducing the
effectiveness of the tools that led to these problems.

On this issue, I would like to encourage the Promotor to be more free
with eir power to increase Priority. This is, after all, why I gave em

The Rule I was thinking of must have been amended or repealed in the Order
reform.  It explicitly said that the Recordkeepor's determination ruled.

Under the new system, Rule 1819 says that when you note a Transfer, it
takes effect.  Curiously, it does not say that the Transfer is reversed if
you change your mind - only if the original Order is vacated.  Even the
latest reform only pragmatized Transfers, not holdings.

Game Custom is of no relevance:  Rule 116 allows you to note any Transfer
not explicitly forbidden.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars thru the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?
And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof thru the night that our flag was still there.
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?


On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep,
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,
In full glory reflected now shines in the stream:
'Tis the star-spangled banner! Oh long may it wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.


And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion,
A home and a country should leave us no more!
Their blood has washed out of of their foul footsteps' pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave'
>From the terror of flight and the gloom of the grave:

Oh! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand
Between their loved home and the war's desolation!
Blest with victory and peace, may the heav'n rescued land
Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation.
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,
And this be our motto: "In God is our trust."
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

The loophole is, of course, that everyone can (and may very well will)

Hmm.  I thought that was the one I was subscribed from, at least that's the one
that shows up on my subscription response messages.  I only have one account
here from which to make submissions.  Both the "rmv" and the "mrb" addresses
point to the same account.  I will attempt to subscribe the "rmv" address to
the lists explicitly.

Although I consider myself more of a Pragmatist, this is the kind of
ultra-pragmatism with which I do not agree.  Any decision based on incorrect
information should be reconsiderable.  The decision to honor the transfer was
made in error because it was based on false information, resulting in a report
which was in error.  We have procedures in the Rules which allow Officers to
correct reports made in error, for whatever reason the report is in error. 
Therefore, I do not believe this to be an "unpermitted change to the records". 
Of course, if the courts disagree, I will abide by that decision.

I'm not sure that P3749 has been distributed. Did my COE on the
Promotor's Report get through? Crito has accidentally distributed
LMP again as P3749. The text of 'More Fun with Priority' has not yet
been distributed by the Promotor, and so possibly cannot yet be voted
on.

Oh I wouldn't want to loosen the competition too much! But I think
a situation where it can take 4 weeks to get even a fairly important
Proposal to the top of the Queue might be of some concern.
