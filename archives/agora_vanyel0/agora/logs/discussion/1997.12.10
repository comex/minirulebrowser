[It's truly unfair to Officers to both take away their Salaries _and_
whap them with an Infraction for the same thing.  Especially for the
Assessor, whose primary duty, tabulating Votes, does not yield a

De gustibus non disputandem est, and all that, but I don't think the
Virus does provide us with much fun and interest.  I'm bored with it,
and am giving the Nomic Public a chance to express an opinion on the
exercise.  Just be grateful that I didn't propose a Chromatic
Repeal. :-)

In other words we are quite capable of causing crisis situations
ourselves.  Why bother with the Virus as well?  To my mind 90% of its
action is mere annoyance and stale annoyance at that.  I'll admit that
the infection of R1598 has been interesting, but neglected corners of
the ruleset have a habit of being brought to our attention anyway,
just with the action of poorly worded Proposals, and interesting CFJs.

I thought of this one quite a while ago - Oerjan can attest to the 
date; I tried to borrow one P-Note from him to pull it off.

Dare I suggest that it would be unstylish to take advantage of this 
now that it's out in the open ? ;)

Since other provisions in R1671 appear to make it the case
the only Frankenstein Monsters can vote on Proposals, it would be
useful if you could post a list of all the current Frankenstein

Maybe I haven't been following this closely enough, but I was under

I think that "such a statement" in the second sentence clearly is a
reference to a statement of the sort described the first sentence,
i.e. one "submitted by any nomic". It may not be necessary for the

that the submitter be a nomic, not a private person.

I will treat the above as a report of adjustments as required.
IIRC, I assigned that Rule a number when it was first believed
to hve been adopted.

'3601' presumably. There are some tricky bits regarding exactly when and
if members of The Threat became Frankenstein Monsters.

(a) Someone might transfer him a P-note. This is now possible because
(b) R1598 has disinfected itself, I think.

For that matter, I already proposed an Insane Proposal (3548? I can't
remember for sure) a while back. It was also Silly.

That was my initial impression, but someone (Murphy? Crito?) persuaded
me out of it. R206 states that:

      Each Voting Entity has two votes on a Proposal, unless another
      Rule says otherwise.

It would appear that R1671 says otherwise. Moreover, the rest of R206
does not guarantee the right to vote of Voting Entities. It only
denies the right to vote to things which are not Voting Entities.

Not so. I remind the Assessor of provision (4) of RGB II:

      (4) if the number of Voting Tokens possessed by any Player
          after the adjustment performed above in (3) is less than 5,
          then the number of Voting Tokens possessed by that Player is
          adjusted to be 5, and to each such increase caused by this
          adjustment there corresponds an equivalent decrease in
          the number of Voting Tokens held by the Bank.

I doubt it.

Indeed, as I have already noticed.  This provision is troublesome, in
that its direct application would seem to require the Bank to come to
possess a negative number of Voting Tokens, which I consider to be
illogical.  I have not reached a decision on this matter yet.

I note that Rule 1741 takes precedence over Rule 1729; thus, IMO,
Public Voting is permitted (and required) on this Proposal.

I don't see how 1741 _permits_ public voting at all. It says that 
votes may only be made by a public message. 1729 says that no such 
public message is allowed, so the natural conclusion, IMHO is that
voting is not possible. There is no conflict, so no need to consider
precedence.
