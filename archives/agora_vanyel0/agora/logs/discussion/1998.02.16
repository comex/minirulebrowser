Personally, I think we need to get Agora away from the almost intolerably
anal way in which we interpret certain rules. This is a good example -- I
think a "batch" of 0 proposals makes far more sense (and is far more
aesthetically pleasing) than the linguistic gymnastics otherwise required
to define exactly what the Promotor is required to distribute.

Question. The Injunction ordering for the original PO of 10 VTs from the
Bank to myself to be vacated has been overturned, so I believe it's not
*somebody's* job to vacate this PO, right? If so, why am I getting hit with
Persistent Indebtedness? Doesn't this PO count as "contested"? 

Is this a bug?

I vacated the original PO that you got for Champion's Reward when the
original Judgement was returned.  The fact that there was an illegal
Injunction attached wasn't relevant to my decision.  Things then went
up for appeal, but I can't vacate a vacation.  :-)

I'd say we were reading it wrongly in the past then.  R402 requires
"immediate", and R1645 doesn't have it.  The fact that it says "The
Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker" is exactly handled by the first
sentence of 402.

I meant in the light of the fact that previous apparent Speaker
transitions were not Speaker transitions at all.  I suspect that the
chances of Morendil being Speaker are fairly low.

Oh that.  Well, I don't know if Steve can point to an example of us
going astray in the past, but if we did it's probably of marginal
influence because the rules which make S-Es become Speakers when a
Speaker's Term of Service expires do call for it to happen
immediately.  Given that that's how Morendil became Speaker, and he
was a properly elected S-E, I think he probably really should be
Speaker because of the strength of the Election rules. 

Of course, perhaps having the wrong Speaker in the past may have made
some big difference to the course of legal events. 

Michael.

Having re-examined the relevant Rules this morning while composing a
COE, I now agree with you that a Speaker Transition a la R402 is
required in the present circumstances.

As you note, the way you write it seems to tie together several Rules in a
mess, and that may even be somewhat the case with the current Rules. Here
are some suggestions to modularize things:

1) Define the concept of Electee of an Office, and that when someone is
retired or eir Term of Service ends, e seizes being the Electee.

2) In the Delegation Rules, note that the D.P. automatically ends if the
Office no longer has an Electee, etc.

3) In the Rebellion Rules and in general, make retirement apply to
Electees instead of actual Officers.

4) Make Elections happen whenever an Office has no Electee.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

My impression of the debate is that Proposals can do any punctual Game
State Changes (which may then by the Rules require later Player action),
but not directly obligate Players to do anything. I am not sure whether
Proposals can do Game State Changes at any time other than when they first
take effect.

Due to Pragmatic Currencies this implies that Proposals cannot transfer
Currencies (since that requires Orders), but I don't think the holdings
themselves are Pragmatized, so they can be _set_ by Proposals.

Could someone send me the headers of the latest SLR?  I

[Forwarded to postmasters at the relevant places]

The basic problem is an error in the alternative MX record for
interworx.com.au which causes mail to fail permanently when the
interworx.com.au host itself is down - if not for that error, I believe
the bounce would only have been temporary if at all:

lie:~:$ host -t mx interworx.com.au
interworx.com.au        MX      20 bishop.cyberalink.com.au.interworx.com.au
 !!! interworx.com.au MX host bishop.cyberalink.com.au.interworx.com.au does not exist
interworx.com.au        MX      10 interworx.com.au

I assume that _should_ have been

interworx.com.au        MX      20 bishop.cyberalink.com.au
interworx.com.au        MX      10 interworx.com.au

You did.  17:22:42 CST is 23:22:42 UTC, so you had 37 minutes and 18
seconds to spare.  Michael's report of the Infractions is improvident
and should be set aside.

I would think that a lot of players in smaller Nomics
are staying in a small Nomic because it is small. If it joined a large
Nomic then they would probably leave.
<<

In addition to size, complexity is another important point. I'm not
sure that all players of other nomics would be willing (or enjoy, for
that matter) wading through the huge ruleset of a nomic like Agora.

Of course, we can't
force them to do so, but we can make it so that failure to comply
adversely affects their Internomic standing. Maybe we could have more 
than two levels of membership status, with various conditions required
for each level.
<<

This is a concept I like. So how could such different level of
membership be organized? Probably by limiting the right to do the
nomic essentials: proposing, voting, making, and judging, CFJs, and
gaining points.

Which of these rights would be the ones available to all member
nomics, and which should be reserved for the nomics that adapt better
to INs requirements? 

Probably voting and judging CFJs are the activities that have the
strongest changing influence on the game. So those might be limited to
"active" member nomics as a first step. On the other hand, isn't that
just about what we have at the moment, anyway?

On that subject, there are ways we could use to reduce the size of what a
Player has to read.  We could split off parts of the Ruleset that only
affect single Officers, for example.  Much of it is already of that kind,
but Players still in principle have to cope with those parts because they
are not officially marked.

I've suggested this before and had it met with considerable
opposition, especially from Chuck.

Yep.  I think it's easier to have a single document, rather
than trying to cross-reference several different documents,
especially when you're dealing with a complex topic, and
the last version of each document was published at a different
time, and some of them incorporate the latest Proposals and
some don't, etc., etc.

In that case there is still a compromise:  Keep all in one document, but
mark some Rules as only applying to certain Players.  It could be as easy
as including a set phrase with each Rule, such as "The following
constitutes part of the Rulekeepor's Job Description:", with the remainder
slightly indented.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

An alternative might be to impose more structure into the publication
of the Ruleset.  I would personally prefer to see more smaller rules,
in place of the present trend toward writing incredibly long monster
rules.

Is that a COE you're making? :-)

CFJ 707 is surely a good guide to prior practice; what else can I do
but respect Game Custom as it interprets the ruleset?

But it didn't reach gecko until after midnight UTC.  If my unoffical
annotation on R478 due to CFJ 707 is correct, then Michael's
report is correct.  Yes, I know you have questioned the correctness
of this annotation, but I have yet to review CFJ 707.

Would someone please send me CFJ 707?

Is it possible that one could discharge a duty to post/publish in the
PF merely by *sending* a message, possibly some time before the contents
of the message actually take effect (when the message is received)?

As I've stated before, in my opinion Chuck's informal annotation in
the Ruleset (pertaining to CFJ 707) misrepresents the precedent
established by that decision.

I would also bring to your attention CFJ 831 and the CFJ (the number
of which I forget; it was called by Morendil) which held that a Vote
sent to the Assessor prior to the end of the VP, but not received
until after, was nonetheless a valid Vote.  (The latter ruling stands
squarely opposed to the interpretation being suggested by Michael.)

I would have no objection to that.  Indeed, it could be done
within the present system of Rule Categories.

I think the General's assertion has been that my annotation does
not accurately reflect the Judge's reasoning, not that the
Judgement itself was incorrect.

Uh, so despite the fact that the injunction was found to be illegal and
thus the vacation was incorrect, I'm still stuck with an unpayable bill and
weekly PI infractions? Is there *anything* I can do about this?

The Judge's reasoning seems pretty clear that messages take effect
at the time they reach the listserver, and I don't see alternative
interpretation.  However, the Judgement doesn't address the issue of
when a message has legally been been posted.

Second point:  I believe Michael is required by Rule 1599 to reissue your
Champion's Reward PO.

I believe that it unduly punishes Officers to be held hostage to the
vagaries of email systems that may delay delivery of mail for hours or
even days without warning.  I also object in principle to the use of
"Received" stamps to establish the time of sending a thing because a
"received" stamp indicates when it was received, not when it was sent.
Furthermore, the use of "Received" stamps for messages to the PF is
inconsistent with the explicit use of "Date" stamps in many places in
the Rule; a consistent "brightline" rule would be appropriate.
Finally, using "Received" stamps substantially complicates official
duties by having to ferret around in the header of every message to
recover them.

I believe the standard I have suggested, in which the "Date" line is
determinative unless it is clearly in error, should be used.

(I thought the vacation was correct.  If it was not, then Michael is

But the use of the appropriate Received: stamp to indicate when a message
takes effect (rather than when it is sent) still seems appropriate,
as messages take effect when *received* by the listserver.

I still don't understand what it means for "a message to take effect."

If you want to hold that we should consider the first of several
copies of a message to be received by the listserver (regardless of
the order in which they were sent) to be the one which we take as
effective, I agree with that.  But that's about the limit of the
extent to which I will allow the use of "Received" lines; the only
other use I admit them is for ascertaining when the "Date" line is
"obviously wrong."

What about the case where a message is sent to more than one Public
Forum?

What about the case when a message is sent to the Public Forum by
direct distribution?

What about the case where gecko's clock gets badly messed up?

None of the header lines is determinative; all of them are evidence.
The determination that any finder of fact will make has to be made on
the basis of all reasonable evidence, not merely some small part of
it.  And, quite simply, the "Date" header is presumptively the time at
which the message was sent; all others are times of conveyances, which
are not the same.  It flies in the face of reason to base the time of
emission of a message more strongly on the time of its conveyance than
the time of its emission, when presumptive evidence of the latter is
available.

I cannot accept a rule (note little "r") of evidence which establishes
a time of receipt as a "stand-in" for a time of emission, which is the
rule that is being advanced.  If the Rules wanted to rely on the time
of receipt, they should do so explicitly.  They do not.

I consider Vanyel's discussion to be dicta, and limited in application
to the specific factual situation at hand.  If and when that situation
arises again (the case of a single message being sent twice) I will
consider Vanyel's reasoning.  I feel Vanyel's opinion has limited or
no applicability in the day-to-day operation of the game, however.

Too much work, with too little benefit, IMO.

For the record, if this must be done, the Rulekeepor would
prefer that Rulemeister be a separate office.  If the
Rulekeepor would like to undertake both Rulekeepor and Rulemeister
duties, e can simply hold both Offices.

This is a funny idea, and with the extra votes on rules you own it is
not only a white elephant. However, you remarked yourself that it
means considerable work. I certainly wouldn't want to have to so
that. I'm also a bit hesitant to vote for rules that create offices I
certainly don't want to fill - is there anyone out there who can
imagine being the first Rulemeister?

OK, what about it?  What would you suggest?  What if a message
is sent to the PF by direct distribution, not by a single message
with multiple recipients, but by distinct (with identical bodies)
messages to each Player?

I believe that it unduly punishes Players to be held hostage
to the vagaries of email systems that may delay delivery
of of mail for hours or even days without warning, thus
potentially subjecting Players to Rules which they are
not aware even exist.

(Note: I am arguing above about what the Rules should say, and
am not making any claims about what they do say.)

The obvious (to me) is to use the date of the last such message sent.
This is evidentiarily hard, but not impossible.  If, for some reason,
the exact time of such a message was of substantial import, a Judge,
acting as finder of fact, could resolve any ambiguities.

Based on the lack of agreement on the meaning of the Judge's
reasoning in CFJ 707, I have decided to remove the unofficial annotation
of R478.  Please note that just as the annotation had no effect
in and of itself, neither does the removal have any effect in
and of itself; in particular, the removal should not be taken
to mean that the annotation was incorrect.

This proposal looks interesting; a few comments and questions follow:

How much does this Office get paid?

A few thoughts on this:
 1.) This isn't really an auction if I understand it correctly;
     each Player who wishes makes one bid and never sees the
     others' bid?  (I would find it much more exciting if this
     was conducted over the Public Forum, since the idea of
     competition could be introduced.)
 2.) It might make more sense to say that if there is no highest
     bid, but that two or more Players have placed bids, the Rule
     is randomly given to one of the Players who bid at the highest
     level for the price offered.

This seems like a weak reward for all the work put in.  I would
recommend including the ability to make Proposals to Amend/Repeal
for free (as you suggested).  Another idea, though this could get a
bit out of control if handled incorrectly, would be to reward the
Owner for any changes made to the Rule by any Player and to penalize
the Owner if the Rule gets Repealed.

Well well well... Y'all sure have been busy ! I'm still catching up
on Nomic mail at the moment, but will shortly be issuing some
Official statements.

The one thing I'm sorry about is having missed a CFJ - I understand 
that the way this now works, I can still return a Judgement even 
while incurring a penalty for lateness ? If that is correct, I will 
be doing so within the next 24 hours.

The offered guideline does not avoid this problem: I have had messages
delayed between gecko and my system by as much as eight hours on
several occasions.

Perhaps we should have Proposals be effective three days after they
are announced, except for emergency proposals? :)

The Rule Categories already perform that function reasonably well.

We currently have 3 levels, with accordant conditions:

Non-member: (Must be a "nomic" - whatever that is.)
	Make make SFJs.
	May not judge, propose, or vote.
	Is not bound by the rules.

Non-voting member: (Must have liason, must request membership)
	Make judge SFJs and Proposals.
	May not vote.
	Is bound by the rules.

Voting member: (Must be included in the list in Rule 215.)
	May vote on proposals

Perhaps, for starters, we could simply add a fourth level, 
"Secuirty Council Member" which has extra voting privileges, or some
similar benefit, but which is required to fulfill some extra criteria.

Anyhow, I think that these existing categories should be redefined more
clearly and pragmatically. I especially dislike the assumption that a
nomic always has a liason, and the requirement of an explicit amendment
to R215 in order to gain voting status.

I think the recent Revolt has revealed some problems with the Speaker
Transition Rules. I think they need an overhaul. For one thing, it
seems wrong to me that a post-Revolt Speaker should be automatically
Tainted. For another, it's not clear what purpose the 3-step handshake
in R402 is serving any longer. When was the last time anyone can
remember the Speaker ever actually having any materials to pass on
to eir successor? It seems to me that the handshake is a hangover
from the days when the Speaker's role was both burdensome and central
to the running of the game, requiring the handover of materials and
a double public ackowledgement to maintain high standards of certainty
about the identity of the Speaker. Finally, R402 distinguishes cases
where the Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker from cases where the
Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker "immediately", yet this distinction is
employed in a casual and arbitrary fashion in the Rules. 

So, what to do? I've begun by collecting together the various Rules
which call for a change of Speaker. As far as I can tell, there are
6 such Rules; three call for immediate Speaker change, three do not.

The immediate change Rules (avoiding the handshake in R402) are:

R1581 calls for immediate change of Speaker every Quarter.
R1347 calls for immediate change of Speaker if the Speaker is On Hold.
R942  calls for immediate change of an Impossible Speaker.

The non-immediate change Rules (invoking the handshake in R402) are:

R1664 calls for change of Speaker when a Revolt occurs.
R1648 calls for change of a Tainted Speaker when the Office of
      Speaker-Elect is being held in the normal fashion.
R681  calls for a change of Speaker when the Speaker voluntarily resigns.

It seems to me that the important principle to be preserved in 
Speaker Transitions is that they occur as the result of some easily
verifiable public event whose legality is unlikely to be the
subject of controversy. In those cases, the handshake is unnecessary.
Rules 1581, 1347 and 681 all certainly meet this standard, and 
Rules 1664 and 1648 probably do. R942 is the exception, but it's
a total mess anyway, hopelessly out of date, never been used and
never likely to be.

Therefore, two simple solutions suggest themselves. The first
is simply to repeal R402. This would mean that all Speaker
Transitions, immediate or not, would occur when the events that
trigger them happen. This would solve the Revolt/Taintedness bug
at a stroke. We'd repeal R942 at the same time.

However, I think there's a legitimate objection that even if
the events are easily publicly verifiable and uncontroversial,
they still can go unnoticed. This is a good argument for amending
R402 to replace the handshake with a simple announcement by the
Registrar, with this announcement actually triggerring the
Speaker Transition. This is the strategy I intend to develop.
Proto to follow.

It's a sealed-bid auction, which is not uncommon in RL.

Except that that would give unfair advantage to those in
"fortunate time zones"--those people more likely to be online
at or near the time the auction ends.  Of course, we already
have this situation with public voting, so I don't know how
much of a drawback this is.  Alternatively, you could have the
auction end when there have been no new bids in a fixed period of time.

Proto-Proposal
Speaker Transition Reform

Be it hereby resolved that R402 (Speaker Transition) be amended to read:

      Speaker Transition is a process which commences at the time
      the Rules call for a Speaker Transition to occur, and which
      proceeds as follows:

      (i) when the Speaker Transition commences, the Speaker loses
      all special rights and privileges that accrue to em as a result
      of being Speaker;

      (ii) as soon as possible after the Speaker Transition
      commences, the Registrar shall post to the Public Forum a
      Notice of Speaker Transition, identifying the reason for the
      Transition and the Player who held the Office of Speaker-Elect
      at the time the Transition commenced.

      (iii) provided that the Notice of Speaker Transition is
      correct in its particulars, the posting of the Notice
      causes the Player identified in it to cease being the
      Speaker-Elect and to become the Speaker. This concludes
      the process of Speaker Transition.

[Comment: (i) ensures justice; during a Transition, one remains Speaker
in name only. (ii) ensures certainty about identity of the Speaker;
the Speaker only changes when the Registrar says so, so there's no
chance of a change of Speaker going unnoticed. (iii) ensures certainty
about the identity of the Speaker in a different way: if the holder
of the Office of Speaker-Elect changes after the commencment of the
Transition but before the Registrar's Notice, the succession is not
affected.]

Be it further resolved that R1648 (When the Speaker is Tainted) be
amended to read:

      If the Rules require that a Speaker Transition occur, and
      the Office of Speaker-Elect is not being held in the normal
      fashion at that time, then the Transition proceeds as set
      out in other Rules, but the new Speaker is Tainted.

      A Tainted Speaker may remain Speaker only until some other
      Player holds the Office of Speaker-Elect in normal fashion, at
      which point, a Speaker Transition occurs.

[Comment: post-Revolt Speakers are not necessarily Tainted.]

Be it further resolved that R1664 (Rebellion) be amended by replacing
the text in it which currently reads:

      - The Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker

with text which reads:

      - a Speaker Transition occurs.

Be it further resolved that R681 (Giving up the Speakership) be amended
to read:

      If the Speaker announces in the Public Forum that e is giving
      up the Speakership voluntarily, a Speaker Transition occurs.

      As soon as possible after the Transition is completed, the
      new Speaker shall bill the former Speaker one Voting Token.

      When a Speaker voluntarily gives up the Speakership in this
      manner, e is prevented from nominating emself for the Office of
      Speaker-Elect for a period lasting two weeks, or until the
      start of the next quarter, whichever is longest.

[Comment: makes R681 PC-compliant, and closes a loophole I once
exploited to achieve consecutive 3 month terms as Speaker.]

Be it further resolved that R1375 (Speaker Going On Hold) be amended to
read:

      A Speaker who goes On Hold while e is still Speaker commits the
      Crime of Speaker Inactivity, a Class B Crime.

      If the Speaker is On Hold, a Speaker Transition occurs.

Be it further resolved that R942 be repealed.

[Comment: a hopeless mess.]

Be it further resolved that that R1581 (Quarterly Speaker Change) be
amended to read:

      A Speaker Transition occurs upon the commencement of each
      new quarter.

Is 'Electee' shorthand for 'Player holding an Office in the normal
fashion'? Ah no, I see it isn't: you intend it to include Players who
have delegated their Offices.
