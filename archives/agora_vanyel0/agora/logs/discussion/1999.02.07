R1486 states that an Active Player "is permitted to call a Referendum to
Impeach an Officer at any time, by requesting such in the Public Forum."
You sent a message to the Public Forum saying "I hereby call for the
Impeachment of Chancellor Andre." I think a commonsense view of that
message is that it is a call for a Referendum to Impeach an Officer,
notwithstanding your omission of the word "Referendum". Similarly, we
regard a message sent to the PF saying "6666: FOR" as a vote for
Proposal 6666, notwithstanding the omission of the words "vote" and
"Proposal". We've had many occasions to learn that it doesn't pay to be
too nitpicky about these things (and in fact you've agreed with me about
this in the past).

Your insistence is as irrelevant as your intentions.

I thought I covered this, from my judgement.

"The Caller in my opinion should be allowed to bar players after the 
Clerk of the Court has assigned a judge.  This would not change the 
judge at that time, but if the judge was then to change, (E.g. the judge 
ceases to be a Player.) then the players which the Caller has barred, 
would still be barred."

The part "This would not change the judge at that time" was ment to mean 
that the barring of a player whilst has was a judge, would not remove 
him.  However, if for what ever reason he then ceased to be a judge, he 
would from that point on be barred from becoming a judge of that CFJ 
again.  Do you want me to order an annotation?

Peekee

Amend Rule 1841 (Granting Power of Attorney) to read:

      A Senator may give eir Power of Attorney to another Player for a
      specified time period, by specifying the Player and time period
      in the Public Forum.  To be effective, the time period must be no
      longer than three months, must begin during the week following the
      posting, and the other Player must consent in the Public Forum
      before the time period begins.

      If the grant is effective, then the Player has Power of Attorney
      over the Senator beginning at the specified time.  This grant ends
      when one of the following occurs:

        (a) The specified time period ends.
        (b) The Senator posts in the Public Forum that e withdraws eir
            Power of Attorney.
        (c) Either Player is deregistered or goes On Hold.

Amend Rule 1842 (Power of Attorney) to read:

      While the Rules grant one Player (known as the Holder) Power of
      Attorney over another Player (known as the Grantor), the Holder
      is the sole Executor of the Grantor.

      No Player may have Power of Attorney over more than two Players.
