The big problem is that right now the only significant VT input is Officer
Salaries. Those of us unlucky enough or lacking in time enough to not hold
any offices have no real way to get VTs.

Before Plots gets proposed again, it definitely needs to be balanced better

Not completely unambiguous: there are untitled proposals occasionally,
one proposer often has more than one proposal in the queue, dates of
submission are not unique either, and the position in the queue
changes when priorites are changed.

I think sticking to unique proposal numbers is the best way to
identify proposals; if they don't get distributed in numerical order
that is merely an aesthetic problem to me - while assigning two
numbers to each proposal is potentially confusing (and less elegant,
speaking of aesthetics).

Well, unemployment benefits are on their way (I hope). And I don't
think the _principle_ of the old VT stipends was wrong, they just were
too high. Anyone for reintroducing VT stipends at lower rates (say one
VT for four proposals you voted on, up to a maximum of 2 VTs per
week)?

Yes, please make sure that plots don't create inflation again. Better
make them start with too low currency input and then amend to increase it.
In fact, I would appreciate very much if you could publish a rough
estimate of the amount of currency that Plots will distribute into our
economy every week, so I can convince myself that inflation won't be a
problem before I vote for Plots.

Not only have I read Vogon poetry...but actually, I quite liked it.
I thought some of the metaphysical imagery was really particularly
effective. Interesting verse structure, too, which, tends to
counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying metaphor of the
Vogonity of the poet's compassionate soul, and which contrives,
through the medium of the verse structure to sublimate this,
transcend that, and come to terms with fundamental dichotomies of the
other.

My first reaction is that this is not a bug but a feature, since it
makes being an Officer more attractive than it probably has ever been
at any time in the past, and this has all kinds of beneficial effects
on the game which are also interesting in their own rights. But your
point about time is well taken, and I also have a long history of
defending the rights of those Players who don't have as many hours
a week to devote to this as some of us evidently do. Which is why I
support modest unemployment benefits.

I'd be unhappy if it were possible to use Plots to generate more than
2 VTs per Playwer per week, and even that level would put scarcity
at risk.

Each of them has the potential to be ambiguous on its own, but where
this is the case, one of the others can be used to disambiguate.

It's true it's largely an aesthetic problem, but it's nonetheless
important to me for that.

I searched the Netscape 4 technical notes for the word "wrap" and the
following may be relevant:

Make sure you have enabled the "Wrap long lines" option.

Make sure you have disabled the "By default, send HTML messages" option. 
My understanding is that Netscape Messenger will autoconvert html to plain
text when sending (except to people registered as html-capable), but the
word wrap does not work properly with this.

See my previous message(1), Cc:ed to your postmaster, about an error in
the interworx.com.au DNS records.  As Scott suggested and the
cyberalink.com.au postmaster confirmed, the problem was a forgotten
period. The records have now been fixed.

(1) In case you lost that too, the problem was that whenever your main
mailhost was down, the mail would instead be rerouted to
bishop.cyberalink.com.au.interworx.com.au, which doesn't exist, and so
the message would bounce permanently.  This has now been corrected to
bishop.cyberalink.com.au.

(Both hosts crashing should not cause a permanent bounce, only a temporary
one until the message can be resent.  As long as the mail disks are not
corrupted, mail should not get lost, knock on wood.)

Greetings,
Ørjan.

It looks like I might be visiting Carnegie Mellon for a couple of weeks 
in June/July, and I was wondering whether any of my fellow Agorans were
nearby that I might visit.
