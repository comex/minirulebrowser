It's not a bad idea, but I think I'd prefer to avoid entanglements with
the whole Applications/Signatures part of the Ruleset. It's simpler just
to amend R1728. Using Applications doesn't really give you any extra
functionality for the WO mechanism. Anyway, see what you think of my
proto.

Well, now the General will have some of the P-Notes he needs. 
2 for the passage of 3804, by R833. None for the Zeitgeist, because 
that clause was recently removed, but 2 more (when Chuck gets around
to it) because both of those Proposals repealed rules.

And unless there is much competition for the Queue, the snowballing effect
due to R833 should enable him to distribute, in time, most of the rest
of eir vast collection of proposals. (And maybe make a tidy profit too.)

Proto-Proposal
Actions Without N Objections

Be it hereby resolved that R1728 be retitled "Actions Without N
Objections", and amended to read:

      Certain changes to Nomic Properties may be made Without N
      Objections, where N is an integer between one and five inclusive,
      specifying how many objections are necessary to prevent the change
      from taking place. Only those changes explicitly allowed by other
      Rules may be so made, and in order for such a change to take
      effect, the Rule allowing the change must explicitly state which
      Player or Players are authorized to make the change. If such a
      Rule does not specify a value for N between one and five, the
      value of N is one.

      In order to make a change Without N Objections, a Player
      authorized to make a given change Without N Objections must first
      post to the Public Forum eir intent to make such a change,
      unambiguously describing the change to be made. The change then
      takes place when a Player authorized to make that change Without N
      Objections (who need not be the same player who posted eir intent
      to make the change) posts to the Public Forum that that change is
      made, and the following conditions are fulfilled:

      (a) the post announcing the change is made no fewer than four days
	  after, nor more than fourteen days after, the post announcing
	  the intent to make the change;

      (b) between the two posts, fewer than N Players posted to the
	  Public Forum objecting to the change.

      This Rule defers to Rules which place further restrictions
      on the effectiveness of changes made Without Objection.

I would think that you, as Recordkeepor for Indulgences, would be able

with sufficient certainty.

Well, what is sufficient?  Is applying it to the oldest PO the most certain? 
If I have to determine the PO(s) to which it applies, what standard of
certainty is "sufficient" for my choice?  Is it one transfer of 2 Indulgences
or two transfers of 1 Indulgence (either one could be applied to Lee's debt)? 
I don't have any problem with being allowed (or even forced) to make such a
choice - I'm just not sure the Rules actually allow it.

Well, I guess this won't work after all. I just checked to see whether
there might be a moment when plots have ceased to exist, but R1844 is
still around. But it seems that all provisions in one proposal take
effect simultaneously (R376), so there is no such moment. I think this
was once possible, and led to the wholesale destruction of VTs when
the identity of their mintor was changed in a currency reform proposal
some time ago...

Ah, I was not aware that Lee had more than one outstanding PO for
Indulgences.  Given this, it is not clear what Lee is doing.  Clearly,
Lee did not make a Transfer Order which succeeded in satisfying a
Payment Order; what is less clear to me is whether Lee made a Transfer
Order at all.  The last sentence of Rule 1598 does not appear to
apply here.

I was thinking , one of my early obstacles was that after i made a
revised report, someone else would look at the revised the report and
note an error that had been in the original report.  I got the distinct
impression some did not look at the first report because they knew
there were errors and as long as it was not ratifiable, there was no
rush to report the error.   I think there should be some incentive to
report errors in the initial report.

Protoproposal Chaos56 [rev. 14]

Currencies

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1721 be amended to read:

      There shall exist the Office of Chancellor.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1467 be amended to read:

      (a) A Currency is any medium of exchange which has designated as
          a Currency in accordance with the Rules.

      (b) The designation of a medium of exchange as a Currency, and
          the cancellation of such designation, may be accomplished
          only by:
        (1) the operation of an Instrument with Power 1 or greater;
        (2) the Chancellor, Without Objection; or
        (3) Judicial Order, whenever the Rules so permit.

      (c) For the purposes of the Rules, units of a Currency are
          fungible and indivisible.

      (d) No tangible medium of exchange shall be designated as a
          Currency.

      (e) A Currency may be denominated such that a fraction of its
          primary denomination is its smallest indivisible unit, so
          long as there is a smallest indivisible unit.  When no other
          specification exists, the smallest indivisible unit of a
          Currency shall be one unit of its smallest denomination. 
          Amounts less than this smallest indivisible unit may be used
          in intermediate calculations; all such calculations shall be
          rounded off at the point that they are reduced to transfers,
          orders to transfer, or other finalized results of legal
          import.

      (f) The Chancellor shall retain and publish at least monthly a
          schedule, listing every medium of exchange designated as a
          Currency under this Rule.  This schedule shall include
          whatever information the Chancellor deems necessary, but at
          least the following information for each Currency:
        (1) the designated denomination or denominations of that
            Currency (and if more than one, the relationship between
            them);
        (2) the fraction of the smallest denomination of that Currency
            which is its smallest indivisible unit;
        (3) that Currency's Recordkeepor; and,
        (4) the Mintor or Mintors of that Currency, if any.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) The "Recordkeeper" of a Currency refers to the entity who
          has agreed to maintain a record of the ownership of the
          units of that Currency.  The Recordkeepor of an Currency is
          subject to the jurisdiction of these Rules.  Specifically, e
          shall:
        (1) maintain the abovementioned records in a manner consistent
            with these Rules, including the timely recordation of
            transfers of ownership made consistent with the Rules;
        (2) comply in a timely manner to all requests to produce those
            records as required by the Rules; and
        (3) perform all other duties which the Rules impose upon the
            Recordkeepor of a Currency.

      (b) A Currency may have any number of designated Mintors.  A
          Mintor may be designated for a Currency, or such designated
          cancelled, by:
        (1) the operation of an Instrument with Power 1 or greater; or
        (2) the Chancellor, Without Objection.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1598 be amended to read:

      Units of a Currency are transferred only when the Recordkeepor
      of that Currency receives a notice from the owner of one or more
      units of that Currency, specifying the units to be transferred
      and the entity who is to owner the units thus transferred.  The
      entity receiving the units thus transferred becomes their owner,
      and the Recordkeepor shall so note this on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1471 be amended to read:

      Units of a Currency are created only when the Recordkeepor of
      that Currency receives a notice from a designated Mintor of that
      Currency, specifying the number of units to be created and the
      entity who is to own the units so created.  The specified entity
      owns the units so created, and the Recordkeepor shall so note
      this on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      Units of a Currency are destroyed only when the Recordkeepor of
      that Currency receives a notice from the owner of one or more
      units of that Currency, specifying the units to be destroyed. 
      The Recordkeepor shall note this destruction on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1596 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever an entity becomes indebted to another for some
          amount of Currency, that entity indebted is required to
          transfer that amount of Currency to the entity indebted to
          within seven days.

      (b) A debt not paid within seven days is overdue.  Any entity to
          whom an overdue debt is due may assess a late penalty of not
          more than 25% of the overdue debt, and may do so repeatedly,
          not more than once every seven days after the debt becomes
          overdue.  Late penalties are added to the overdue debt.  An
          entity may elect to charge smaller late penalties, charge
          them less frequently, or forego late penalties altogether,
          at that entity's sole discretion.

      (c) If the validity of a debt, or any part thereof, is disputed
          by a Call for Judgement, that debt (or portion thereof) is
          not considered overdue, and does not accrue late penalties,
          while the dispute remains unsettled.

      (d) When an entity transfers units of Currency to another entity
          for the purpose of making a payment on debt, the receiving
          entity shall apply that payment to the nondisputed debts
          owed to em by the transferring entity, in order from oldest
          to newest.  A debt is paid when a transfer has been applied
          to it in this manner.  Any surplus will be retained by the
          receiving entity, to be applied to future debts or returned
          upon demand.

      (e) An entity may assume that any Currencies transferred to it
          to be payments on debts due to em, unless the transferree
          clearly indicates otherwise when making the transfer.

      (f) An entity who is owed an overdue debt may issue an Order
          requiring the entity who owes that debt to make payment by
          requiring a transfer of any amount up to the amount of the
          debt due, but only if no other Order currently in force
          requires the same entity to make payment on that same debt
          or any part thereof.  Such an Order shall be stayed (by the
          Clerk of the Courts) if the debt in question is subsequently
          disputed, and vacated (by the Judge) if it is found that the
          debt upon which the Order is based is invalid.

      (g) An entity who is owed a debt may cancel all or part of that
          debt at any time.

      (h) A Judge may enjoin the assessment of late penalties,
          restrict the amount of late penalties, or require the
          reduction or cancellation of a debt, by Judicial Order, when
          the Rules specifically so allow.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1479 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever a Rule calls for an Officer to pay out some
          quantity of Currency to some entity, that Officer shall
          execute a Notice of Debt for the given amount with that
          entity as payee and the Bank as payor.

      (b) Whenever a Rule calls for an Officer to bill an entity for
          some quantity of Currency, that Officer shall execute a
          Notice of Debt for the given amount with that entity as
          payor and the Bank as payee.

      (c) A Notice of Debt is executed by announcing in the Public
          Forum that the payor is indebted to the payee for the amount
          indicated, so long as the announcement sets for the reason
          therefore.

      (d) The lawful execution of a Notice of Debt causes the payor
          noted therein to be indebted to the payee noted therein for
          the amount noted therein, but only if the executor of the
          Notice of Debt was authorized to execute it, and the reason
          set forth therein is correct.

      (e) The duties required of Officers by this Rule shall be
          performed as soon as possible after they arise.

      (f) For the purposes of this Rule, the Speaker shall be
          considered an Officer.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1817 be amended to read:

      (a) The Recordkeepor of a Currency is required to record every
          transfer for which e receives a transfer notice denominated
          in the Currency of which e is the recordkeepor, when:
        (1) the notice was sent by the transferring entity's Executor,
            or, for an entity which lacks an Executor, by any other
            person empowered by the Rules to execute transfers on the
            behalf of the transferring entity;
        (2) the notice clearly sets forth the quantity to be
            transferred in a form such that the Recordkeepor can
            easily and definitively determine the amount being
            transferred;
        (3) the entity to receive the transfer is specified with
            sufficient clarity that a reasonable person in the
            Recordkeepor's position would know to which entity the
            transferring entity refers; and
        (4) the transfer is for an amount not more than the current
            holdings of the transferring entity.

      (b) Transfers shall be noted on the Recordkeepor's records in
          the order in which they are received by the Recordkeepor.

      (c) When a Recordkeepor records a transfer, e shall promptly
          inform the recipient of the transfer that the transfer has
          been recorded, unless it appears to the Recordkeepor that
          the recipient is already aware of the transfer.

      (d) When a Recordkeepor elects not to record a transfer for the
          reason that the transfer is not in conformance with any part
          of subdivision (a) of this Rule, e shall promptly inform
          both the transferrer and the recipient that the transfer has
          not be recorded, and give the reason therefor.  (If the
          reason for failure to record is that the recipient was not
          clearly specified, there is no duty to inform the
          recipient.)

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1696 be amended to read:

      (a) Voting Tokens are hereby designated as a Currency.  The sole
          designated Mintor of Voting Tokens is the Bank.  The
          Recordkeepor of Voting Tokens is irrevocably designated to
          be the Accountor.  The smallest indivisible unit for this
          Currency is 0.01 Voting Token.

      (b) The Accountor constructively agrees to act as Recordkeepor
          for Voting Tokens by accepting the Office.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1701 be amended to read:

      (a) Proposal Notes are hereby designated as a Currency.  The
          sole designated Mintor of Proposal Notes is the Bank.  The
          Recordkeepor of Proposal Notes is irrevocably designated to
          be the Promotor.

      (b) The Promotor constructively agrees to act as Recordkeepor
          for Proposal Notes by accepting the Office.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1435 be amended to read:

      (a) Indulgences are hereby designated as a Currency.  The sole
          designated Mintor of Indulgences is the Bank.  The
          Recordkeepor of Indulgences is irrevocably designated to be
          the Herald.

      (b) The Herald constructively agrees to act as Recordkeepor for
          Indulgences by accepting the Office.

      (c) An entity which owes a debt (or debts) to the Bank for any
          number of Indulgences is said to have that number of Blots.
          A Player has Blots equal to the sum of all such debts. Debts
          which are in dispute are still considered when determining
          how many Blots a Player has.

      (d) When a Rule states that a Player is to gain some number of
          Blots, a Notice of Debt shall be executed for the same
          number of Indulgences, naming that Player as the payor and
          the Bank as payee; this order shall be executed by whomever
          the Rules require to report the change in Blots.

      (e) A Player who has no debt in Indulgences to the Bank is
          Immaculate.

      (f) It is a Win-Preventing condition for a Player to have one or
          more Blots.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1738 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever there is an entity in Probate which does not have a
          Trustee, the Notary shall nominate a Player to be that
          entity's Trustee.  E shall announce this appointment in the
          Public Forum.

      (b) As soon as possible after the Notary announces the
          appointment of a Trustee for an entity in Probate, the
          following records shall be provided to the Trustee:
        (1) by the Recordkeepor of each Currency, an accounting of the
            number of units of that Currency held by the entity in
            Probate; and
        (2) by the Notary, any Will of the entity in Probate which has
            been filed with the Notary.

      (c) In the event that the Trustee does not receive any part of
          the foregoing records within seven days, e may proceed as if
          the records would have indicated that the entity in Probate
          possessed no units of the appropriate Currency or did not
          have a Will, as appropriate to the type of records not
          received.

      (d) During the seven days immediately following the Trustee's
          appointment, e shall make a diligent effort to determine all
          debts due to the entity in Probate.

      (e) Any entity who is owed a debt by the entity in Probate must
          inform the Trustee of that debt within seven days of the
          Trustee's appointment; any debt not reported to the Trustee
          within that time is deemed cancelled.

      (f) If any of the debts of or due to the entity in Probate is
          disputed, the Trustee shall not develop a Plan for the
          disposition of the estate of the entity in Probate until
          after all such dispute are settled, and in no case shall e
          do so until the expiration of the time allowed by
          subdivision (e) of this Rule.

      (g) As soon as possible after the time permitted to proceed by
          subdivision (e) of this Rule, the Trustee shall formulate
          and announce in the Public Forum a Plan for the disposition
          of the estate of the entity in Probate according to the
          provisions of the Probate Code.

      (h) If no objection to a Plan formulated pursuant to subdivision
          (g) of this Rule is posted in the Public Forum during a
          waiting period of seven days following its announcement, the
          Trustee shall, as soon as possible after the expiration of
          this waiting period, perform whatever steps are necessary to
          implement the Plan for disposition.

      (i) If an objection (other than an objection previously
          adjudicated to lack foundation) is made, the Trustee shall,
          as soon as possible after the objection was made, either:
        (1) discard the current Plan, and formulate and announce a new
            Plan; or
        (2) make a Call for Judgment alleging that the objection lacks
            foundation.

      (j) If a CFJ is made alleging that an objection to a Trustee's
          Plan lacks foundation, then the Trustee shall neither
          formulate a new Plan nor implement the existing Plan until
          the CFJ is resolved.  If a CFJ finds that an objection lacks
          foundation, then the Trustee may proceed as if that
          objection had never been made, and any attempt to announce
          that same objection again shall be disregarded.

      (k) An objection to a Plan for disposition has foundation if it
          correctly alleges that:
        (1) the Plan constructed is not in accord with the provisions
            of the Probate Code;
        (2) the Plan disregards the Will (if any) of the entity in
            Probate;
        (3) the implementation of the Plan as constructed would be
            substantially unfair to a creditor or heir of the entity
            in Probate; or
        (4) the Plan would not fully dispose of the estate of the
            entity in Probate.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1601 be amended to read:

      (a) An entity is dissolute if it:
        (1) possesses any number of Units of Currency, or owes or is
            owed a debt; and
        (2) does not have an Executor.

      (b) The Notary shall place in Probate any dissolute entity which
          is not already in Probate, as soon as possible as e becomes
          aware of the dissolute entity.

      (c) A dissolute entity is considered to continue to have legal
          existence for as long as is necessary to complete its
          Probate (and thereby cease to be dissolute), even if it is
          dissolved, destroyed, or otherwise would cease to have legal
          existence prior to that time.  An entity which has legal
          existence solely as a result of this subdivision is called
          "terminal".

      (d) The following definitions apply with respect to entities in
          Probate:
        (1) Assets: all units of Currency held by the entity in
            Probate, along with all debts owed to the entity in
            Probate.
        (2) Liabilities: all debts owed by the entity in Probate.
        (3) Creditor: any entity which is the payee of a debt owed by
            the entity in Probate.
        (4) Debtor: any entity which is the payor of a debt owed to
            the entity in Probate.
        (5) Heir: an entity named in the Will (if any) of the entity
            in Probate.
        (6) Estate: the combined assets and liabilities of the entity
            in Probate.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1739 be amended to read:

      (a) The Plan for the disposition of the estate of an entity in
          Probate shall be constructed as detailed below.
        (1) The Plan shall divide the assets of the estate amongst its
            creditors, assigned to each creditor assets equal to the
            amount due that creditor, if it is possible to do so for
            all creditors, or a pro-rata portion otherwise.
        (2) If the entity is terminal, and has a Will, the assets
            remaining after all creditors have been assigned their
            shares shall be divided as specified in the Will of the
            entity in Probate.  Any surplus remaining after the
            explicit provisions of the Will are applied shall be
            divided amongst the heirs in a manner consistent with the
            Will.
        (3) Any units of Currency remaining in the estate at this
            point shall be assigned to the Bank.

      (b) Methods of assignment:
        (1) Units of Currency are assigned to an entity by requiring
            that those units of Currency be transferred from the
            entity in Probate to that entity.
        (2) A debt owed by the entity in Probate is assigned by
            requiring the execution of a Notice of Debt setting forth
            a debt identical to the debt to be assigned except that it
            shall be due to the entity to whom the debt is being
            assigned.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1757 be amended to read:

      (a) The Trustee of an entity in Probate is authorized, all other
          Rules notwithstanding, to transfer Currency from the entity
          in Probate to any other entity as if e were that entity's
          Executor, when the Plan for the disposition of the estate of
          that entity requires it.

      (b) The Trustee may execute Notices of Debt when the Plan for
          the disposition of the estate of the entity requires it.

      (c) The Trustee of an entity in Probate ceases to be Trustee
          when:
        (1) e announces in the Public Forum that e resigns as Trustee;
        (2) e ceases to be a Player;
        (3) the entity of which e is Trustee ceases to be in Probate;
            or
        (4) the Notary announces that the Trustee has been removed.

      (d) An entity in Probate ceases to be in Probate when its
          Trustee announces the completion the implementation of a
          Plan for the disposition of the Estate of that entity.

      (e) Upon the completion of the implementation of a Plan for the
          disposition of the Estate of an entity, all debts owed to or
          by that entity as of the time it entered Probate are deemed
          to be satisfied.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1637 be amended to read:

      (a) A Will is a document created by an entity which specifies
          how that entity prefers that its assets be disposed of in
          the event that it becomes dissolute.

      (b) The Trustee of an entity in Probate shall, in constructing
          the Plan for the disposal of the estate of that entity, be
          bound by and shall follow the provisions of that entity's
          Will to the extent that those provisions are applicable and
          not inconsistent with the Rules.

      (c) An entity may file its Will with the Notary.  The Notary
          shall retain a copy of each Will filed with em until such
          time as that entity files a new Will or files a notice with
          the Notary cancelling the prior Will.

      (d) Neither the Notary nor the Trustee of an entity in Proabte
          is under any obligation to discover Wills not filed with the
          Notary, but a Trustee may determine, through examination of
          any relevant evidence found by or presented to em, that the
          entity of which e is Trustee had an unfiled Will superseding
          the Will filed with the Notary, and applying that Will
          instead.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1853 be amended to read:

      (a) Taxes may be levied only when the Rules explicitly permit

          An announcement of levy must specify:
        (1) The Currency being taxed;
        (2) the amount of the levy, expressed as a percentage; and
        (3) the legal authorization for the levy.

      (c) Upon the announcement of a tax levy conforming with
          subdivision (b) of this Rule, each entity other than the
          Bank becomes liable to the Bank for a debt equal to the
          stated percentage of that entity's holdings of the Currency
          stated in the announcement.  The amount of each entity's tax
          debt shall be based on the amount of that Currency owned by
          that entity at the time the announcement was made.

      (d) The Recordkeepor of the Currency named in a tax levy shall,
          as soon as possible after the announcement, provide a report
          setting out the amount of the taxed Currency held by every
          entity which held any units of that Currency at the time the
          announcement was made.  The Recordkeepor is not required to
          compute the tax due; if e does so, eir computations do not
          have any legal force.

      (b) Each Voting Entity who votes on a Proposal is liable to a
          debt to the Voting Bank for a number of Voting Tokens equal
          to the votes cast by that entity on that proposal,
          multiplied by the voting cost of that Proposal.  This debt
