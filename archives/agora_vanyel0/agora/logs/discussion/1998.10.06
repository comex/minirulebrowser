Does that mean that there's been a Voting Report I haven't seen?

Having just turned in a book manuscript exactly on the due date (yay!), I 
finally had time to catch up with a month's worth of Agora mail.  One comment: 
The "P-Note Tap" proto-proposal doesn't mention P-Notes anywhere in its text. 
The title of the Rule has no legal significance.  So, wouldn't this prevent 
the bank from satisfying any payment orders at all, creating a snafu and funds 
shortage similar to the accidental one that was just resolved?

  - Agoraphobe BethMo

-----Original Message-----

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "The P-Note Tap", be created
with the following text:

      The P-Note Tap is either on or off. Initially, the Tap is on.
      While the Tap is on, the Bank's executor shall satisfy Payment
      Orders naming the Bank as payor in the normal way, as described in
      other Rules. While the Tap is off, the Bank's executor is not
      required to satisfy any Payment Order naming the Bank as payor,
      nor shall e do so; e is instead required to vacate any such
      unsatisfied Payment Order (including Payment Orders which were
      executed while the Tap was on, but remained unsatisfied when the
      Tap was turned off), either as soon as possible after it is
      executed, or as soon as possible after the Tap is turned off,
      whichever occurred later. This Rule takes precedence over any Rule
      which would require the Bank's executor to satisfy Payment Orders
      naming the Bank as payor while the Tap is off.

      The Promotor is the sole Player authorized to turn the P-Note Tap
      on, or off, and e may do either by posting the appropriate notice
      to the Public Forum, provided that at least a week has passed
      since e last turned the Tap on or off.

The ultimate item of value here, however, is not the P-Note itself,
but the ability to have Proposals distributed.  The Proposal Queue
automatically indexes the total number of P-Notes in circulation
to a certain value: if there are lots of P-Notes in circulation,
each one is worth little; if only a few, each is worth much.  (Again,
this is when there is competition to have Proposals distributed,
which admittedly is not the case now.)  Adding the P-Note Tap,
it seems to me, adds an additional level of complexity which
won't really affect the value of the total P-Notes held by the
average Player.

There have been two, I sent them this morning, but they don't seem to

I haven't seen them either.  Anyway, reporting the R947 bonus is
the Rulekeepor's duty, not the Assessor's.

Well, you have a point, I guess, although I'm not sure it's a strong as
you think it is. If there were competition to get Proposals distributed,
then, it is true, the number of P-Notes in circulation would likely
fall. But that's like saying that if there were competition to get
Proposals adopted, then the number of VTs in circulation would likely
fall - so why have taxes? I guess the difference is that we accept as
normal the situation in which most Proposals are not controversial,
whereas we would like the normal situation to be that there is
competition to get into the Queue. So, OK, perhaps I'll leave "The
P-Note Tap" in the proto pile for now, while we turn to examine a more
important question: what can we do to correct the current lamentable
situation in which very few Proposals are getting made? To answer that
we need to know more about what reasons individual Players have for not
making Proposals. Is it lack of time? Lack of ideas? Lack of funds?
Ennui? I fear for our game, I do.

I question the social utility of making it difficult to make proposals
or cast votes.  Aside from that, however, I also feel that your
aggressive anti-inflationary efforts are counterproductive to
developing a working economy; instead of directing your attention to
the structural flaws, you continue to tinker with the decorations.
The house is nicely gilded but is constantly falling down.

Once again, I am going Rule blind. Where do the rules say that I am not
empowered to issue this Order, and where do they say what I should do 
now?

I agree.

BTW, is it possible for a proposal priority to be nagative? R1036 says
"integer". If integers can be negative, we might have more priority

Well, 947 says that it is the Rulekeepor who has to pay out the repeal
reward.

Now let's look at the validity of the order you issued. According to
the definitions in 1794, it is a private order. But I can't find
anything that would have prohibited you from executing such a private
PO. So I guess you can just leave the order as it is, or, if you like,
you may vacate it (this you can always do based on 1799.

If you let it stand, the order might be challenged in court based on
1796, but I think that it won't be easy to demonstrate that your PO
doesn't fulfill the requirements of that rule.

One might be nitpicky and say that your order, being published on the
PF, was not sent "directly" to the player you are ordering to do
something, in violation of 1808. But I'm not sure that would go
through.

One might also try to get the PO classified as "improper" using
1809. The meaning of "improper", AFAICT, is not defined in the rules,
though, and the concept is only briefly mentioned in connection with
Judicial Orders in 1695. So the courts would have to decide whether
your PO is improper based on their personal views.

Surprizingly, this is all I could find concerning this issue, in a
first brief look at the rules. I thought there was a requirement
somewhere that POs may only be issued, or at least are only valid if,
the rules explicitly authorize and require the player to issue the
PO. But I can't find such a clause. Has it been repealed recently, or
what am I overlooking here?

I think there is a complicated interaction of these (except possibly lack
of funds, since there are enough P-Notes in circulation).  For myself, lack of
time is the largest factor, lack of *creative* ideas is also always a problem
for me 8).  But currently there is no incentive in the game for me to try and
overcome these obstacles.  It is just too difficult to get simple,
uncontroversial proposals passed.  I suspect that a free flow of such simple
proposals provides fuel to spark more creative ideas.  That spark is missing
right now.

Also, the current voting dynamic ("If I really like it I'll vote for it, if
not, I just won't vote"), combined with the secrecy of voting, has deprived the
game of one form of interaction that was prevalent when I first started playing
- discussions of how and why Players were voting the way they were during the
voting period.  I think the game is poorer for this loss, and that this may be
contributing to some sense of ennui.  I too fear for our game.

Be that as it may, I think an attempt to make an interesting economy is/was
laudable and I'm willing to let this experiment run longer (which is why I
intended to support "A Duty to Vote", even though I was too late).  However,
the longer this has gone on, the more I am beginning to suspect that using
Voting and proposal making as the basis for an economy can only be stifling to
a Nomic (even though it is the natural choice since those are the only two
things of any intrinsic value in the game).  It may be better left as a
subgame.

Speaking of subgames, what's going on with the MOOs?  Aren't we supposed to be
generating a lot of proposals to deal with them?  (That's where I think the
economy experiments truly belong).

I will hopefully get Spring Cleaning out soon, since there seems to be no
substantial changes to make to the last Proto.  I am going to Cork,
Ireland this Saturday (for two months) and I need to find out what kind of
Internet access I will have there first.  And the new Hold Rule doesn't
really fit in very well either (grumble!)

Greetings,
Ørjan.

I agree, and this is why I am now drafting a proposal to eliminate all
VT and P-Note aspects of proposing and voting, and also to return us
to the era of one Player, one Vote.  I hope to have it ready soon.

I would say, it used to be for quite some time. Now, presence has been
reintroduced for several weeks, but we seem not to have noticed.

In addition to the time problem many of us seem to have, is it
possible that we are running out of basic goals to chase after?
Getting an economy to run is one, and I think we may be too successful
with it at the moment - it is running in such a smooth way that there
isn't much people really want to change about the economy and the
underlying framework (currencies, orders etc). 

The big reforms that led to these things were so thorough that now,
with the bugs fixed, noone is keen on substantial reform; side shows
like the MOO don't attract enough effort to make them truly
interesting. So what is the next goal for our game? 

Maybe it could be to radically simplify the game be deleting many
basics we got used to, like currencies and so on, moving back to a
more initial-rule-like, short rules set with space for simple scams,
changes etc that are not just detail tinkering or, on the other hand,
huge reform projects.

Or we consider the current low level of activity appropriate to the
mature state Agora has reached, and are content with it.

Or, as seems likely now, we continue to play with the various levers
our economy gives us, like P-note battles over priority, changes in
the BOS, etc. Let's get plots to work, for example (yes, I know, it is
me who has the latest plot repair proto in the drawer for much too
long now).

I guess we need a new goal shared by many players.

Protoproposal Chaos35 [rev. 1]

Restore Sanity

NOTE: Text enclosed in right brackets has no legal significance and
      shall in no way affect the legality or efficacy of any part of
      this Proposal.

[This Proposal does not seek to eradicate either Voting Tokens or
 P-Notes; it merely removes them from having any role in the process
 of making or voting upon Proposals.  I will leave it for later to
 decide what should be done with the Currencies themselves.]

Be it hereby resolved, that Rule 206 ["Voting Entities and Votes"] be
      amended to read:

      (a) Each Player is entitled to cast at most one Vote upon each 
          Proposal.  

      (b) A Player may be deprived of the right to cast a Vote upon
          any one Proposal, or upon Proposals generally, by the Rules
          or by an Order issued pursuant to the Rules.

      (c) No entity other than a Player may cast Votes upon
          Proposals. 

      (d) The term "Voting Entity" is hereby declared to be synonymous
          with "Player", except where such construction would clearly
          not make sense.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1442 ["The Cost of Voting"] be
      repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1765 ["Attributing Additional
      Votes"] be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 683 be amended to read:

      (a) A Player casts a vote upon a Proposal by sending a message to
          the Assessor specifying the Vote e is casting and the Proposal
          upon which it is cast.  

      (b) A vote cast under this Rule must be one of FOR, AGAINST, or
          ABSTAIN, or an obvious synonym thereof.

      (c) Any attempt by a Player to cast a vote is void and without
          legal effect if: 
        (1) the attempted is made cast other than during the Voting
            Period of the Proposal in question,
        (2) the Player attempting to cast a Vote is barred from
            Voting upon that Proposal by the Rules or by an Order then
            in effect barring em from doing so, 
        (3) the Player attempting to cast a Vote has previously cast a
            vote (other than a vote made void by this subrule) upon
            that Proposal, or
        (4) the attempt violates, or if allowed would violate, this or
            any other Rule.

      (d) Votes, once cast according to this Rule, cannot be
          retracted, cancelled, or changed except when the Rules
          require it, and then only as required by the Rules.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1715 ["Announcing One's Presence"]
      be repealed.  [Presence is irrelevant with free voting.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1449 ["The Assessor"] be amended to
      read:

      There shall exist the Office of Assessor.  The Assessor shall
      receive a weekly salary equal to the Basic Officer Salary.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1824 ["Debt Voting"] be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1660 ["The Speaker's Vote"] be
      repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1760 ["Quorum Buyback"] be
      repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1723 ["Sanity"] be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1724 ["Urgent Proposals"] be
      repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1036 ["The Proposal Queue"] be
      amended, by replacing the word "zero" with "one" wherever it
      appears. 

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1771 ["Increasing Priority"] be
      amended to read:

      (a) Not more than once in any Nomic Week, each Player may select
          any one Proposal in the Proposal Queue and may increase or
          decrease the priority of that Proposal by one, by sending a
          message to the Promotor indicating the Proposal to be
          affected and whether that Proposal's priority is to be
          increased or decreased.

      (b) An attempt to change the Priority of a Proposal in the
          Proposal Queue shall be void and without legal effect if:
        (1) the Player who attempted it has already changed the
            priority of any Proposal during the same Nomic Week;
        (2) the attempt relates to a Proposal which is no longer in
            the Proposal Queue; or
        (3) the change attempted would result in the Proposal having a
            priority less than zero.

      (c) The Promotor and the Speaker shall each be permitted to
          exercise this right twice in each week, instead of once.
          However, if the same Player is both Promotor and Speaker, e
          may not exercise this right three times.  Subrule (b)(1) of
          this Rule shall be interpreted so as to be consistent with
          the intent of this subrule.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1772 ["Promotor's Privilege"] be
      repealed.  [The privilege is incorporated into the revised Rule
      1771.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1838 ["Tabula Rasa"] be repealed.
      [While not strictly a necessary part of this Proposal, this Rule
      serves no purpose.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1862 ["The Voting Tariff"] be
      repealed.

Good point.  Although "presence" still leaves something to be desired.  I've
had something of a minor epiphany here, as far as goals go.  For me and most
Players, I think, the discussions are the main source of fun and excitement. 
It's not usually the actual workings of the game that provide the fun, but the
road to getting there (this seems to me to be the point of Nomic, after all). 
My epiphany is this.  Any changes that *increase* the potential for discussion
within the game contribute to its health and longevity.  Any changes that
*decrease* the potential for discussion contribute to its stagnation and
possible demise.  Something to keep in mind from a "game design" perspective
(if you agree with me 8)).

Originally, "Presence" was a change that tended to decrease discussion, because
it's an easy way out of taking a stand on a proposal.  Of course it's not as
bad as changes that make Players shut up completely 8), so it's reintroduction
was a step in the "right" direction.

The Secret Voting Experiment will come to its natural end next week, on
Oct. 12. We will then have a new voting environment which we have never
tried before, once which should encourage discussions of voting and
voting intentions if anything will: compulsory, public voting. I'm
looking fordward to it.

With the passage of "A Duty to Vote", VT expenditure will at least double,
to around 16-20 VTs/week. Once again, I call on Chancellor Michael to
raise the BOS.

I applaud this radical proposal, even though I don't support it. We can
use the controversy.

My attitude to this is that I'm against it, at least for now, especially
when we've just adopted "A Duty to Vote". I'd like to see how that
works. After that, who knows? 

I'd kind of like to see this tried as a 3 month experiment of its own,
starting in 3 months' time. It wouldn't be terribly difficult to do.
Instead of all the repeals and amendments, you add self-nullifying
clauses with a 3 month time limit to those Rules, and create
self-repealing Rules with the same time limit where you now have
amendments. If we liked the results, you could then propose what you
have now, which would make the changes permanent.

It's already been repealed by P3792.

But there's an important difference: there's a maximum number of VTs
which can be spent by a Player on a given Proposal.  Not so with
P-Notes; if there were thousands of P-Notes in circulation, it might
not be unusual to see hundreds of them spent on a single Proposal.

In my case, it is lack of time only, and none of the others.

There is no blanket prohibition which says that a priority cannot
be negative, but each of the individual Rules which allow priority
to be decreased prevent the priority from being decreased below
zero by that method.

And what is there of value in a subgame for the basis of an economy?
The ability to vote and propose within the subgame?  I suppose if
the subgame were a voting entity, you could add voting in the main
game to the list, but I don't see that that would add a whole lot.
If you believe that having an economy is stifling (which I don't),
why would having an economy in a subgame be any different?
