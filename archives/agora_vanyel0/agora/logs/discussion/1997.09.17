Cartainly Internomic is one way to go. The other option is Intranomic,
that is, encouraging the bifurcation of Groups within Nomic. But
for Nomic to reach that level, we would need to broaden its 
appeal. Also, I think we would have to be content with an even
lower average player/game interaction than at present, at least
if we mean by "game" the process of voting, proposing, etc.
Most people can't abide government even when it does useful
things, let alone when it exists only for the purpose of it own
self-perpetuation. Finally, we'd need a better format for getting things
done, like a MUD, or an interactive web site.

After rereading the relevant Rules, this looks pretty straightforward
to me (but note, this is *not* Elde's Judgement) :

* before 3533 passed, the Mint was a Nomic Entity
* the Mint was defined by Rule 1470
* 3533 amended 1470 so that it no longer defined the Mint
* by Rule 1586, the Mint ceased to exist
* at that time, the Mintor of VTs was still the Mint (1696)
* by Rule 1579, all VTs were therefore destroyed at that instant
* (thereafter, 1696 was amended to make the Bank the VT Mintor)

As far as I can see, the fact that all of that happened in a single
message, and therefore 'simultaneously', is no objection - these
events occurred in the order outlined above, and Rules calling for
certain events to occur presumably apply 'instantly', and even
'between' simultaneous events. 

Any reason not to Judge TRUE ?

Actually, some of those purported POs were of the form "X commits the 
Infraction Y which carries a penalty of Z Blots".

IMHO any phrase which is functionally equivalent will be
satisfactory. A PO could be phrased 'Please remit to the Bank the sum
of X...', or 'You now have to pay X', in short anything that makes
it clear that an obligation is incurred as a result of the message.

> The point of the invoice is that *is* a command to pay: sending an

That is mostly because it is customary to interpret an invoice as
such; IOW it is the word 'invoice' that implies this meaning. Agora
doesn't yet have Game Custom making some form or forms of message
implicitly equivalent to POs.

> R1596 says that "A Payment Order is an order...", but I read this just
> as if it said "A Payment Order is an invoice..."

I read 1596 as giving very precise criteria for identifying a message
that qualifies as a PO; it must contain an order, name a Currency, an
amount, a Payor and a Payee. Reading it as stating that anything that 
could conceivably be interpreted as an injunction to pay some amount 
of a Currency is a PO is IMHO unacceptably dangerous.

I think that would be a hasty conclusion to draw, not at all an obvious
one. I don't think the recent decline in Voting can be attributed to
the changes to the VT system; they were in place, without really affecting
Quorum, for quite a long while. Rather, I think it's a combination of
the recent list troubles, a lack of interesting Proposals, and perhaps
that the current Assessor doesn't issue voting reminders as I used to
do.

That's not a bug, that's a feature. Such effects would be interesting,
in my opinion.

I still like this idea. *Real* VT scarcity...write up a proto, I say.

Yes, it's a strange case. Once again, the question is when the Voting
Period starts for a Proposal distributed in the 10 days before the
disinfection of R693. By the arguments already given, it cannot be
when they are distributed. And I agree that it would be a retroactive
effect of disinfection, and hence blocked by R108, if we took the VP
to have begun at the moment of distribution, as of the time of
disinfection.

Can the VP begin at the time of disinfection itself? There's nothing
in the Rules which specifically allows it; that might be enough to
disallow it because of R1011. If that's right, then the VP cannot begin
at all, just as it cannot for Proposals distributed just after the
infection.

I had similar ideas a while ago.  Internomic is analagous to a United
Nations, or a world government; all citizens (Players) of its member
states (nomics) are within its jurisdiction.  It is possible to have
multiple nationality (be a Player of more than one member nomic).
RL statelessness is more difficult to simulate, but could be achieved by
separating registration in Internomic from registration in member nomics.

Actually, there's nothing stopping IN from adding such aspects, while
retaining the nomics-as-players idea.  All it needs to do is recognise
the players of its players, and legislate about them.  There's no need
to call them players.

It does in RL legal systems; however, we can use whatever term we like
in our Rules.

I disagree. Such a message does not state that it is a PO; it does
not in any conceivable interpretation order or command anyone to do
anything; it is also ambiguous in that I for one am not at all
certain what it means for someone to 'receive' or 'gain' a Payment
Order. Of course, 1435 tells us that *when* one gains a Blot a PO 
*shall be* executed, which I do not hold to be the same as equating a 
message stating that one receives Blots to a PO. Lastly, the above 
message does not name a Payee.

R1596 says that a Payment Order *is* an order. It doesn't say that a
Payment Order must *contain* an order...

You are missing the part of the rule which states that a PO which has the Bank
as its payee *is* a Blot, which does equate receiving a Blot to receiving a PO
with the Bank as payee.  The only thing which is not clear in the above
message, is who is actually issuing the PO.

      A Payment Order for 1 Indulgence, the payee of which is the
      Bank, is called a Blot.

Were I entitled to seek a "fair and equitable" solution, I would hold
that the Voting Periods should begin at the time of disinfection.
However, the Rules of Agora need be neither fair nor equitable. :)

The following is a Proposal from Agora:

Create a Rule with the text:

The liaison of a nomic can only be changed by that nomic, and such a change
is not effective until notice of it has been sent to the the internomic
mailing list. The moderator can only be changed as specified in the Rules.

Create a Rule with the text:

The liaison of any member nomic can sent a message to the mailing list,
claiming that the moderator is not present. If the moderator does not send
any message to the mailing list during the complete period of fourteen
days starting at the time of this message, the liaison of the nomic
who claimed that the moderator was not present becomes moderator
automatically.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

comment: Neither Rule 216 nor Rule 323 forbids the change of liaisons
and moderators. This proposal would cure that situation. The second rule
is to avoid that absence of the moderator would block the game.

Proto: Taxes a la Robin Hood


1. General concept

Create a new rule, called "Tax collections":

	Tax collections may only be conducted when they are required
by the rules or authorized by a procedure prescribed in the
rules. 

	The tax collector for a particular tax collection is the
Recordkeepor of the currency to be collected. This currency is
referred to as the taxed currency.

	Taxes must be collected in integer amounts of the taxed
currency. In this rule, the amount of tax to be collected will be
denoted by N.

	To collect a tax, the tax collector shall make a tax payors'
list. If no other rules define the tax payors' list for a particular
tax collection, the list contains the entity or entities that possess
the largest amount of the taxed currency at the time immediately
before the tax collection.

	If the number of entities on the tax payors' list is equal to
N, the tax collector shall execute payment orders for 1 unit of the
taxed currency with the Bank as payee and each of the entities on the
tax payors' list as payor of one order.

	If the number of entities on the tax payors' list is larger
than N, the tax collector shall randomly select N entities on the list
and execute payment orders for 1 unit of the taxed currency with the
Bank as payee and each of the N selected entities as payor of one
order.

	If the number of entities on the tax payors' list is smaller
than N, the tax collector shall execute payment orders for 1 unit of
the taxed currency with the Bank as payee and each of the entities on
the tax payors' list as payor of one order. E shall then begin another
tax collection for the remaining amount of taxes to be collected. For
the purpose of making the new tax payors' list for this additional tax
collection POs executed not more than 24 hours before the additional
one are to be considered as satisfied.



[Remarks:

- If the first round of tax collections does not suffice to collect
the required amount, another collection starts, with a newly
determined payors' list that may differ from the first one. I hope the
very last sentence of the Rule makes sure that the first round of
payments is considered as having been made when the second round
starts, and so forth for further rounds. Still, the 24 hours should
encourage speedy payment, and prevent the tax collector from having to
check for outstanding POs of earlier tax collections.

- The default of the tax payors' list is the "Robin Hood" bit of this
proto - the exact opposite of a flat tax. Of course, Rules prescribing
particular taxes may define this list in other ways; for example, they
may contain only an entity requesting a particular service (this would
allow a kind of "fee" in the sense of Scott's earlier proposal), or
only groups, or only players etc.

- Note that all entities may be on the payors' list, including groups
or contests.

- Taxes are collected by the recordkeepor, because e is the only one
who always has access to an up-to-date record that is needed for the
default payors' list. Of course, this gives em some influence on who
will pay through he choice of the time when the tax is collected. This
is an intentional temptation to abuse official knowledge and become
bribable.]


2. Introduce the first tax

Amend 1735 by introducing the following paragraph after the first
paragraph:

	Whenever the Chancellor executes a transfer order for VTs with
the Bank as a payor, e shall at the same time order and authorize the
Assessor to collect, as soon as possible, a tax for the same amount of
VTs. If e executes several such orders at the same time e may group
the corresponding tax collections together into one collection.

Amend the last paragraph of 1735 by adding the sentence:

	As soon as possible after this the Assessor shall vacate all
payment orders executed for tax collections triggered by such illegal
transfer orders.


[Remark: This essentially fixes the amount of VTs in circulation.]


3. Punish tax evasion

Create a new rule called "Tax Evasion".

	If a CFJ accusing an entity of tax evasion is judged TRUE,
this entity shall become a tax evader and be listed as such in the
Notary's report. All tax evaders are automatically added to the tax
payors' list of any tax collected.

	An entity ceases to be a tax evader if a CFJ stating so is
judged TRUE.


[Remarks:

- The obvious way to avoid Robin Hood taxes is trying to park one's
currency holdings somewhere. If you park them in a group or an active
contest, that's fine - in principle, these can be taxed, too, and
trying to avoid taxes is part of an economy with taxes. But it would
be too easy to just create lots of contests with the sole purpose of
storing one VT. This rule tries to avoid that.

- I am only sure we need some kind of rule with this purpose, but I'm
not sure about the necessary details, or whether this version is good
enough.

- I am not sure whether this rule should define clear criteria for
what tax evasion is, or whether this concept would be a nice thing to
develop via case law and precedence. I think the latter could be fun.

- Is "tax evader" proper English? I am afraid it isn't.

- As it stands tax evaders may be subject to POs they cannot
meet. Tough luck.]


4. A kind of "ongoing RGB" can be implemented in this framework, too:

Create a rule called "Ongoing RGB":

	If at the beginning of a Nomic Week the difference between the
number of VTs in circulation (i.e. not in the Bank) and five times the
number of players at that time is positive, the Assessor shall collect
an RGB tax of VTs as soon as possible. The amount of tax to be
collected is a quarter of this difference, rounded down.

	If at the beginning of a Nomic Week the difference between the
number of P-Notes in circulation (i.e. not in the Bank) and five times
the number of players at that time is positive, the Promotor shall
collect an RGB tax of P-Notes as soon as possible. The amount of tax
to be collected is a quarter of this difference, rounded down.


[Remark: Of course, the numbers in this Rule may be adjusted if they
turn out to be bad.]

Unfortunately, because of the rather badly worded Rules
pertaining to Internomic Referenda, no Referendum can be held on it
(the Voting Period would be of negative length).
<<

Can't we start a referendum on it, now? 1434, 1st sentence, says "is
required", not "required by the rules". So I could "require" one, too.

Of course the question is whether it would be "the" referendum on the
IN proposal referred to in the last paragraph of 1632. But the one
prescribed in 1632 itself never happened, as Scott stated.

I am not doing so now, but like to hear your comments on whether I
_could_ call a referendum on IN proposal 347 now, with the default
conditions set by 1434 and 1632, except that

      * Duration of Voting : the Voting Period shall last until 48 hours
      before the InterNomic Voting Period on INP 347 is over.

Do you think that would be legal? Scott, do you think that you could
then submit our vote in time?

It would be embarassing not to be able to vote on this one.

Morendil tried this recently, without success.  The consensus was, I think,
that this had to be interpreted as "required by the Rules".

Well, we'll have to try something else then. What prevents General
Chaos to vote on behalf of Agora in any way e wants to? Ok, so the
prescriptions of 1632 don't apply, because there was no
referendum. But while 1632 would oblige the Ambassador to vote the way
the referendum decided, now that there was no referendum 1632 puts the
Ambassador under no obligations whatsoever. 

And elsewhere in the rules there is nothing to stop em from voting
whichever way e likes now - or is there?

If this is correct, we might hold a completely informal referendum and
ask Scott very politely to vote according to its outcome.

I would say so.  A Referendum that is not held can be described in
many ways, and I think that, in the absence of a special definition,
"undecided" is one of them.

If you want to say that anything may be said of something that doesn't
exist ("any statement about all members of the empty set is true")
then you could just as well claim that there were more votes for than
against. 

But I think it doesn't make sense to speak of a nonexistent
referendum as passed or failed or undecided.

The last two paragraphs of 1632 are void, because they refer to
something that didn't happen or doesn't exist. It's just as if they
referred to the Frankenstein Monster's Brother or something.

That's completely different.  There's no empty set here.  It's one
specific entity, which happens to lack the property of existence.

No, one couldn't in this case.  That referendum, as it doesn't exist,
had no Votes cast FOR, and none AGAINST.  It did not pass or fail.
It has quite clearly not been decided; it is therefore undecided.

I don't think so, because a referendum that never happened isn't
anything; in particular it isn't undecided.

Existence is not a property, but a precondition to possessing
properties.

It may be that I must hold the Referendum, but since it will end
before it begins, no Votes can be cast on it, and it will end
"undecided".

I will admit that I may have forgotten to post it in August, but I
know I posted it in July.

None of the recent moderators has made even a token effort to
distribute the Internomic Rules to the Member Nomics on anything even
resembling a timely fashion.

Careful research shows that I made a bad assumption in my search pattern
(I searched for " 114" analogously to what I do with the Agora Ruleset,
while most of the actual postings had the "114" at the start of the line.) 
So there were actually several postings of the IN Ruleset. Sorry about
that.

Greetings,
rjan.

Note the following:
A currency's Mintor is the only one empowered to destroy a Currency.
Only a Currency's owner is empowered to destroy the instances of
the Currency in his/her possession.

Why?  Some reason you don't like MUQs?

"1 unit" is not well-defined.  Is "1 unit" of VTs 1 VT or 0.1 VT?

Um, that'll be pretty difficult if the Rules don't define some
way to cease to be a tax evader.

Hrm. Amongst philosophers, the view that existence is a property is
pretty unfashionable. On the other hand, amongst philosophers, modal
realism - the view that possible worlds really exist - is taken
pretty seriously. On this view, althought there are no non-existent
things, there are plenty of non-actual things. Go figure.

I find to my surprise that this argument is pretty good! Nothing in
the Rules generally prohibits Rules from acting in the past; only
Rule Changes cannot take effect in the past. But as Crito says, the
Rule Change is not retroactive, only the application of the
disinfected Rule is.

Crito, I think you should seek to give this position a Judicial stamp
of approval.

It is not obvious that the Frankenstein Rule is not the Frankenstein
Monster. It is also not obvious that they are the same, but there is
game custom to support the identification: during the period when the
Frankenstein Rule required the Registrar to send 'a copy of the
Frankenstein Monster' to newly registering Players, I sent new
Players a copy of the Frankenstein Rule. This practice was never
challenged.

I believe you are mistaken about R1435. Here's the relevant part of
R1435 for reference:

      A Payment Order for 1 Indulgence, the payee of which is the
      Bank, is called a Blot.  When a Rule states that a Player is to
      gain some number of Blots, a Payment Order shall be executed
      with that Player as the payor, the Bank as the payee, and for a
      number of Indulgences equal to the number of Blots that Player
      is to receive.  This order is to be executed by whomever is
      required to report the change in Blots.

What does the second sentence mean? You seem to be interpreting it
as if it said: "When a message states that a Player gains a certain
number of Blots, a Payment Order shall be executed...". But that is
not what the Rule says. What it does say is that "When a Rule states
that a Player is to gain some number of Blots, a Payment Order shall
be executed...". So, for example, if Mark commits the Infraction of
Failing to Judge, the Rules (specifically, R408) then say that Mark
is gain 3 Blots, which gain is to be reported by the CotC. It is
precisely toward *this* situation, when the Rules state that a Player
is to gain Blots, but before any action has been taken to ensure that
this occurs, ie before the CotC actually sends any message, that the
paragraph from R1435 quoted above is directed. If the CotC then sends
a message (as e is required to do) saying "Mark receives 3 Blots",
this counts (via the identification of Blots with POs for Indulgences
given in the first sentence quoted above), as 3 POs for 1 Indulgence
each, executed by the CotC, with Mark as the Payor, and the Bank as
Payee.

I've been thinking about drafting a proto to implement Kolja's idea for
real VT scarcity, ie capping the number of VTs in circulation at, say,
5 per Player. I can think of two different approaches to this.

1. Limit the number of VTs *in existence* to 5 per Player. A fortiori
this limits the number of VTs in circulation. That means, in the
first place, destroying a lot of VTs, since there about 10,000 of
them in existence now, and then performing regular checks, say once
a month, to make sure that more haven't crept into the game. (VTs
would have to be created when new Players registered, but they might
not be destroyed when Players deregistered.) An implication of this
is that Salaries, if kept in their current form, would probably not
be paid most of the time due to lack of funds in the Bank. (I'd want
to limit the Chancellor's ability to create VTs in the Bank above the
threshhold.)

2. Define 'in circulation' as 'not held by the Bank' and explicitly
put a cap on VTs in circulation. This would leave the large numbers of
VTs in the Bank untouched, which would mean that Salaries could continue
to be paid, at least in theory. (We might want to block Salary payment
if it would violate the cap on VTs in circulation.) Again, we'd have
to perform regular checks and corrections to keep the number of VTs
in circulation roughly steady at 5P. Details of how this could be done
might vary considerably.

Reactions?

On the other hand, nobody ever challenged my claim that there were no
Frankenstein Monsters, during the period when the Chancellor was
required to retain a schedule of Frankenstein Monsters.  So we have
contrary precedents to deal with in this case.

I read this as creating a one-member list in most cases, a 2-member list if 2 
entities are tied for having the largest amount, etc.  Is that what you
