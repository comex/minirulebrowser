Not really.  The Nomic World experience has demonstrated that
attempting to implement Rule-defined structures within automation is a
bad idea.  I prefer the relatively lack of dependence on automation
that we have now and am loathe to surrender that for the dubious and
unproved merits of moving onto a MUD.

I think doing so is a stupendously bad idea; see above.

All of which, IMHO, are liabilities as well as advantages. What 
concerns me is the risk of rejection by the established community
of the imported Agoran community, as well as the possibility that
the imported Agoran community could fail to establish a distinct
identity, or establish a level of independent activity sufficient for
the Ruleset to be capable of having any effective control over such
activities.

God, the Fork Proposal is still around?  Is this still the same Fork

I prefer to think of them as exciting new challenges rather than dubious
and unproved merits. :) But of course I understand your concerns. I've
been one of the strongest resisters of the encroachment of automation,
and for precisely these reasons. I was on Nomic World, too, and I
learned the same lessons you did. But there are reasons for optimism as
well as skepticism: Shattered World uses the same driver now as Nomic
World did 6 years ago - but that same driver has been subject to 6 years
of improvement. Geoff's view is that it's much more robust and stable
now than Nomic World ever was back then. Its facilities for object
creation by non-wizards have been greatly improved. Geoff thinks that
reifying VTs, for example, would be a "trivial" task.

To me the most exciting opportunities afforded by the move to a MUD are
those that come from the chance to interact with an economy and
political system external to our own, namely, that already in place in
SW. So, I'd like see VTs traded for Coins, which can be used to buy
food. In Shattered World, you have to eat, after all. But I doubt SW
citizens are going to want to trade in VTs they can't see when they
type 'inventory'.

There are risks, I agree. There are also potential benefits. I'd prefer
to try it and see rather than rule it out in advance without having
tried it. Whatever happened would be interesting, and wasn't that the
whole point?

Well, yes, but the Proposal is not "still around". Ie, it's not being
seriously considered.

Which gives me another idea. A lot of my ideas recently have been in the
form of 2 month trials. Why not this one as well? We could try moving
Agora lock stock and barrel to SW for two months. Actually 3 months
might be more realistic. We could begin the process of allowing our
Ruleset to respond to the new environment there. If, after 3 months, we
don't like the way things are developing, we can always quit. I could
even write a Proposal arranging things so that, if we decided to quit
after 3 months, we could return ourselves to the game state as it is
now, with no damage done.

We still have to keep the code up to date with the Rules.  I don't
care how much SW's code has improved, this will still be a problem.

Personally, I want little or no interaction between Agora's
parlimentary economy and the MUD's economy.  I don't want Agora's
Players to have to participate in the MUD other than legislatively and
judicially, unless they want to.  Requiring this will almost certainly
lose some Players, and we can't afford that.

There's a rollicking discussion going on on Morendil's AgoraMOO
netdive.com port 7777); come join it. :)

After Morendil's quite sweeping protos I've tried to come up with a
smaller solution. Check it out.

This is a first sketch of how Agora could interact with things
happening in MOOs, MUDs, etc with Agorans involved. It puts some
emphasis on building rather than just "playing" the MOO to avoid
stalemate when you've been walking and talking enough.

Yes, it's just a very moderate start.

But it could be extended. The contests statutes could require members
to pay Ergs to the contest for each MOO object they create. Agora
rules could force all Agorans involved with MOOs to become members in
this contest. And so on. The proto at the end of this mail is a simple
example of how the Agora rules could interact with such a contest, and
thus (indirectly) with the MOO. There is also the interesting question
of interacting with technical RL matters (e.g. who does Morendil grant
building rights to?).

This is kinda like minimalist nomic, with one gimmick (the
competitions) alrady thrown in. The rest could be developed from
within the contest.

I think that most of the things we wanted to realize in connection to
MOOs (short of a full move of Agora to a game within some MOO) could
be done on this basis. On the other hand, they could grow organically
from this small start, and there is very little risk involved, neither
of technical or MOO coding problems, nor of drawbacks for Agorans who
are unable or unwilling to move to a M** (except that they lose a
chance to generate some extra income - but note that the only net VT
input to the economy caused by this is through the subsidy).

What do you think? Would you enter such a contest? Vote in competition
surveys? Vote for the proto?

Kolja A.

__________
MOO builders' contest statutes (draft 1.0, 7.8.98)


1. Contestmaster

The first contestmaster is Kolja.

2. Motions

The statutes are changed by adopted motions. A motion is distributed
when a member of the contest sends it to all other members. It is up
for vote for seven days after its distribution. It takes effect when
the contestmaster publishes the voting results to all members after
these seven days, and if the necessary majority of votes cast for the
motion by members of the contest in mails to the contestmaster is
sufficient.

3. Majorities

Motions concerning single digit statutes need a two-thirds majority of
all votes cast to be adopted, others need a simple majority of all
votes cast.

4. Members 

Only players of Agora can become members of this contest. They may
become members by notifying the Contestmaster and paying the Entry Fee
to the contest.


10. Entry and Membership Fees

The Entry Fee for this Contest is 2 VTs.

The Membership Fee, to be paid by each member as soon as possible
after the first day of each month, is 1 VT.


20. The Competition

Every month, this contest organizes a MOO building competition.

It is held in two categories: Best Room and Best Object.

21. Submissions

During the whole month, all Agora players (not just contest members)
may nominate objects of any officially recognized MUD, MOO
etc. created by any member of the contest as entries to the
appropriate category of the competition.

22. Survey

As soon as possible after the first day of each month, the
Contestmaster shall post a complete list of competition submissions
made in the last month to the PF.

For two weeks after this distribution all players of Agora (not just
contest members) may cast one vote in each category of the
competition by notifying the Contestmaster. Members of the contest may
not vote for MOO objects they created themselves.

[Comment: Should we use the Referendum structure given in the rules,
or just a simple homemade survey as described here?]

As soon as possible after the end of this survey period the
Contestmaster shall publish all votes cast in the competition.

23. Rewards

Together with the publication of the survey results, the contestmaster
shall pay out the competition rewards. 

The reward for the winner of each competition category shall be a
fraction of 1/(n+2) of the contest's currency holdings (fractions
rounded down), where n is the number of categories.

[Comment: this assures the contest always has some money left to pay
taxes etc.]

In case of a tied win in a category, the reward shall be divided
evenly among the winners.

24. No rewards for bad debtors

If the winner of a category still owes the contest any currency at the
time e is to receive the reward, and at least one of these debts is
older than two weeks, the reward for this winner shall be cancelled.

25. Officially recognized M**s

AgoraMOO (netdive.com:7777) is an officially recognized MOO.

[Shattered world could be added here, as could LambdaMOO and any
other.] 

---------
Proto: Contest subsidies

[Comment: I've tried to phrase this such that the subsidy concept can
be generalized to other contests, too.]

As the development of a community of MOOing Agorans is welcomed by
Agora, be it hereby resolved to create a new rule with the title
"Contest subsidies" and the text:

As soon as possible after the end of each month the chancellor shall
pay out to each contest the monthly subsidy listed in this rule (if it
is nonzero).

The monthly subsidy for the MOO builders' contest is 2 VTs.

The monthly subsidy for all other contests is currently zero.

[Add your contest here if it gets your support for this proposal... ;)]

This last suggestion sounds like the easiest to implement, however it runs the
risk of forcing those of us with less time on our hands to choose one Agora or
the other, thereby diluting both.  Maybe it would be work for both e-mailers
and MUDers to let the development of an economy be wholly MUD-based and let the
manipulation of Rules continue to be e-mail based.  Of course, this would mean
going back to free voting and proposal making.

A bunch of us were given a guided tour around Shattered World yesterday.
They seemed (at least, the few citizens we spoke with) to be quite
amenable to us moving in to a "city" within their world, and declaring
it to be our domain. The laws they have there are pretty much restricted
to "Sanom City" - the main city in the MUD, but the world is quite big
and there are other cities around which we could move in to.

Which raises the question: if we do "take over" a city in this way, how
do we assert our authority? Working on the definition that government is
"legitimate enforcement", we need to ask "How do we gain legitimacy?" 
and "How do we practice enforcement?".

Legitimacy should be relatively easy. First of all, we should be able 
to get the Gods' approval of what we do, which is pretty much all the
approval we need. It is hard to argue with the Gods. To bolster this,
we ought also to seek Sanom City's official recognition as a separate
state.

Enforcement is a bit harder. I've been trying to find out how Sanom 
handle it. Power seems to come in two forms - money and "physical"
strength. It would appear that the Sanom City council rely on the
former, and use the latter more indirectly. A significant part of their
justice system is the "bounty" arrangement, whereby large sums of 
money are paid for the corpse of some outlawed player. This is probably
fairly effective (depending on how extreme "death" is in the game),
but relies on the government having the funds to pay the bounties, which
can be quite large.

Delgath (our guide) was rather unclear on where the money for bounties
comes from. Apparently there is some "City Treasury" which funds them,
and which is in turn funded by sales of real-estate in the city, and
similar things. We would have to see whether a similar account could
be set up for us in our city, and how we could fill it.

I would like to talk with the Wizards and Gods of the world before we
do anything, but I for one am quite intrigued by the possibilities that
moving into SW would open to us - a real "populace", a complex economic
system, and close contact with a foreign government. It could be lots
of fun.
