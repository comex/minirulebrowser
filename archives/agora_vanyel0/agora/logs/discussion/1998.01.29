This is true.  I think I will do so; it should save the judicial
process the hassle.

Mostly minor comments about spelling and grammar. But also included
are some more substantial remarks about the distinction between being
authorized to do something and being required to do it, which I don't
think you've quite yet gotten clear on.

Let me say that I really like this proto, and appreciate the effort you've

I think you may mean 'refer to' rather than 'reference'. But more generally,
what purpose is this sentence serving that is not already served by the
previous sentence?

'shall initiate an Endgame Procedure' is more straightforward.

'An Appeal of a CFJ...' I'm also not sure about this 'being ruled upon'

I wonder about that 'empower'. For instance, does the requirement
above that the Scorekeepor must order Players' Scores set to zero
upon the termination of the Endgame Procedure actually empower the
SK to order this change? Or does it merely require em to order it?
I think only the latter: there's a difference between being required
and being authorized, which comes up most clearly in cases where we
want to prevent a Player who is authorized to do something from
legally doing it unless e is also required to do it. I think what you
want to do here is, first of all, change the above to read '...and do
not both require and empower a Player to order that change...', and
secondly, add a provision somewhere in the enabling legislation for
Points that if a Player is required to order a Score change, then e
is also authorized (or 'empowered' if you like) to order it, but not
necessarily vice versa.

In line with the above suggestions, I think this 'empowered' should
read 'required to' (correcting a grammatical mistake as well). I note
that in what follows, you use the locution 'Player X must order...',
which is a requirement, not an empowerment. So if the Rule were
left as is, this Rule would not apply to any actual cases, since no
Rule which orders Score changes by requiring Players to order them
specifically empowers anyone to order anything.

This is almost what we need. But you seem to be assuming that Score
changes will occur only as the result of Players begin required to
order Score changes. You might want to leave room for some Players
to order Score changes at their discretion (this might be added to 
the range of Speaker's Patronage, for example), which would be a
case of a Player being empowered to order Score changes without
being required to do so. Now, you could argue that what's really at
the Speaker's discretion is whether or not to award a Point, but that,
having decided to award one, he then *is* required to order the Score
change. But I think it's more straightforward to treat things as I
have suggested. In which case, the above provision should read:

      If a Player is required to order a change to the Score, then
      e is empowered to order it, but not necessarily vice versa.

I haven't checked, but I suspect that similar confusions about the
empowerment/requirement distinction may lurk in the Currency Rules
from which you say this proto was lifted. I hope not, though.

Slightly ungrammatical ('a number of Point Tokens those Players possessed')
and pretty unclear. The Player with the highest Score (why is 'Highest'
captialized? - you're not slipping into bad old habits are you Swann? :)
will usually be a Winner, n'est ce pas? So perhaps this should read:

      As soon as possible after a Player Wins, the Scorekeepor shall
      bill all Winning Players, and the Player or Players with the
      highest Score (if any of them did not Win), for the number of
      Point Tokens possessed by each of them respectively, at:

The Endgame Procedure is an excellent concept, and should be expanded
to include all Wins, so that all Wins occur at the conclusion of an EP.
Then (i) will be unnecessary.

The reason it makes my job easier is that I don't have to ferret out
all such instances of reveral myself, but only record them when
they're reported to me by someone else.  Under the prior system, I had
to pore over _every_ finding of law (either by Judgement or by common

This got to be extraordinarily difficult, especially as the Rules grew
more complex.

I have a couple of worries about this Rule:

1. It seems as though the Scorekeepor can initiate an Endgame Procedure
simply by announcing that a Player is Eligible to Win, even if there
plainly is no such Player. It's not a serious bug. If I understand the
proto correctly, the EP would be terminated due to there being no
Playey Eligible to WIn.

2. More seriously, the last two paragraphs appear to contradict each
other. Does the EP persist until it is terminated by the SK, or is it
terminated a week after it is initiated, reagrdles of whether the SK
announces this fact? Later on , we have this:

>Let the following Rule be created;
>{Title: Termination of the Endgame Procedure.}

There seems to be some confusion over exactly what constitutes termination
of the EP. Given the pragmatic motivations of the Proposal, I think
the second of the three paragraphs I have quoted dealing with the EP
should read something like:

      The Scorekeepor is required to terminate an unchallenged Endgame
      Procedure as soon as possible after a week has passed since it was
      initiated. The Rules may require the Scorekeepor to terminate the
      Endgame Procedure at an earlier time.

Hm, but now the third paragraph looks weird. Perhaps the second paragraph
is fine, and it's the first paragraph which needs tweaking:

      An Endgame Procedure shall persist until the Scorekeepor announces
      that it has been terminated.

But that still seems to conflict with your second paragraph. Well, there's
something wrong here, but I can't see quite how to get it right just now.

Despite these problems, I'll still be voting FOR. There'll be plenty
of time before an EP is initiated to fix this.
