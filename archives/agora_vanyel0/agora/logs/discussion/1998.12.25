'Cause Referenda cover a number of miscellaneous functions - impeachment,
IMPs (tho' I suppose they are not around anymore)... I couldn't decide
on any one Officer to be responsible. Any suggestions?

Why not indeed? The next version will include such measures. Is 3 the
right number, do you think?

There's no way I'm going to accept such severe restrictions on Players'
initial holdings, while the Order starts with 13 VTs.

I point out that the Treasuror Rule only provides for having _players_
named in the Budget, and not groups or other such entities (whose holdings

to allocate the VTs to the Group members, and trust them to make the
appropriate transfers to their Groups.
