It's an interesting idea, but a rather limited one, since only MUD
wizards would be able to play, and they are a rare breed.

That sounds very much the argument I used to sell the experiment in
first place. The only difference I can see is that it might be possible
that lowering Quorum back from 5 to 3 might encourage Players to spend
a few more VTs speculatively on Proposals which they think might have
a reasonable chance of making Quorum on the strength of declarations of
Presence. We'll see.

Well, yes, but how to define it? What we want to capture is the
intuitive notion of the assets over which a Player has control, so that
we can say, for example, that Chuck has control over the assets of
Chuck's Savings and Loan Contest, and count those assets when we decide
if Chuck is rich enough to be obliged to vote. But it won't work simply
to specify that a Player has control over assets which are either
possessed by the Player, or possessed by an Entity of which the Player
is an Executor, since Players can hide assets in Groups, which they may
not be the Executors of.

Seems to me that assets owned by entities for whom one is the 
Executor is a good definition.

That's less of a problem than it seems. If you hide cash in a Group,
someone is going to pay tax for it, namely, that Group's Executor. It
shouldn't matter to Agora's equivalent of the IRS who pays tax for
a given asset, as long as tax is collected on it.

The worst we can expect is Players scheming to have their assets
distributed more evenly among a larger number of Entities than they
would normally be, in order to be less visible to whatever tax 
mechanism is in place; but even that would be a Good Thing, since
it would be an incentive to move capital around.

When I wrote "game wizard", I didn't necessarily mean someone who
actually goes out there and writes MUD code.  Obviously someone would
need to be able to do this among the Players, but not everyone would
need this. 

I really like the idea of connecting a game like Agora to a "world".
As it is, Agora is entirely self-referential, and ultimately a touch
sterile.  (Perhaps even more so if we go ahead and repeal five
Offices!)  

How about acquiring a world by invasion?  We could try and infiltrate
and/or take over lambdaMOO...

Yes, I do still like Plots.  Of Steve's Office repeals, I would
probably support the repeal all but the Cartographor.

On the other hand, the game is still a bit too self-regarding.  If we
had an outside world to interact with, I think things would be more
interesting.  The problem with Plots is that they are entirely
internal.  We're constantly inventing new Currencies and ways of
assessing our relative positions within the game, but they are never
founded on anything "solid".  

If we had an external world beyond the scope of the rules to interact
with, we might become a little more grounded.  

Of course, the ultimate in external worlds, is the real world itself.
We could go this route by registering Agora as a charitable
organisation.  This isn't really that appealing because what
could/would we do in the real world?  Setting ourselves up in a
virtual world would be more interesting, because there are more
interesting (competitive) games to play in such environments. 

Michael.

Probably.  But why cut ourselves off by giving ourselves our own world
where the only people playing are ourselves?

 Hmm, offhand, I see two reasons; one is that the Lambda people might 
resent an invasion, although there are some people here that wouldn't, if
I am to judge by past experience, let that be an obstacle; another is 
that taking over an existing complex world such as Lamba, with its
existing system of ballots and whatnot, would probably be more work
than it's worth.

 Anyway, if the objective is to extend Agora with a 'concrete' 
context to sustain things such as Plots, it seems to me that the most 
logical way to proceed would be to create a new MOO specifically
for the task, pass a few Rules establishing the relationship between
Players and AgoraMOO characters, and work on from there. It's
an interesting notion, but I'm not sure that the practical difficulties
(I expect that setting up a Lamba clone would be a rather extensive
task, and of course we'd have to find a server for it) can be overcome.

Yes, "take over" is a bad choice of phrase.  I think "establish
ourselves in" would be better.  I don't think we should do anything so
contentious as invade.  I think it would be sufficiently interesting
to try and establish ourselves (or at least, as many of the Players as
were interested) in an existing world.  It would give our ruleset a
real challenge as well; it would have to start giving real
consideration to things (people and objects) beyond its purview.

I don't much like this idea.  As you say, it would be an awful lot of
work, and more significantly, it would also defeat the purpose of
forcing ourselves to deal with a "real" world.  Because we created it
as part of Agora, we could legislate it out of existence, and/or alter
much of it at whim.  This would be impossible in the context of an
existing MUD. 

Michael.

Well - I don't much like this idea. ;) My problem with it is that we
would be playing LambdaMOO, not Agora. I have nothing against Lambda
(actually, I've taken an interest in it since it was mentioned on
the list, and am currently waiting for a character registration) but
I don't see that it would be that interesting to mix up the two.
Starting with a fresh system would still give our Ruleset the
challenge you want, I think, and in any case isn't it the
technicalities of legislating control of a 'concrete' virtual world
that are the point of initiatives such as Plots, rather than the
wholly different problem of exporting Agoran culture to another
social context ?

But a hostile invasion. and a full fledged takeover, is only the
extreme thing a group of people can do in a M**. We could also just
form a group of players who coordinate their actions within that
world, maybe forming something like an Agora guild or whatever. This
might even be quite enjoyable to veteran members of the target M** -
it seems to me most of these games are always willing to take on new
people. 

What's the address of LambdaMOO, again?

Moreover, a player may be Contestmaster of a genuine Contest, which 
contains funds which do not belong to em, and which e cannot use for
eir own ends. To penalise such players would be grossly unfair.

Au contraire, as I see it the challenge would lie in transposing 
the Agoran system to the concrete context of the Lambda system.
We would have a merry time amending the Rules to permit Votes
being sent via a LambdaMOO 'Voting Room', and dealing with
the problem of keeping the english-language Rules in synch with
their programming-language implementation (as mentioned in
the posts that started this thread).

The latter is definitely what I've come to think would be the
interesting option.  Thanks for expressing the idea so well.

For example, in "The origins of virtue" by Matt Ridley, it is claimed
that the medieval merchants of Northern Europe organised a legal
system that regulated behaviour without much reference to the central
states in which they traded.  This legal system came to be quite
pervasive, even in the absence of state-like powers of enforcement.
It would be interesting to see if the Agora Guild could do as well in
an embodied "world".

I don't see why. It would simply become part of the cost of running a
Contest, and a ContestMaster could add provisions to the Regulations
to keep a portion of the entry fees sufficient to offset that cost.

Well, yes we would be playing LambdaMOO, but we'd also be playing
Agora at the same time.  What's more, I'd aim to keep people without
the time to engage fully in the MOO experience as full Players of
Agora (though they'd clearly have slightly different status -- that of
ghosts or something).

Yes, there would be technical difficulties in getting our ruleset to
legislate control of a world.  This is clear from our difficulties
with the Plots legislation.  But in fact, it is exactly these
difficulties that I would aim to avoid by giving ourselves up to the
physical reality of an existing MUD.  This introduces quite different
difficulties: those of coping with a reality that is *external* to the
ruleset.   (The only degree to which this happens at the moment is in
the ruleset's acknowledgements that Players are not always able to
perform the duties required of them.)  

Setting up a new world within the purview of the ruleset is far less
interesting in my opinion, which is why I prefer embodiment in a MUD
to Plots.

Michael.

But there would also be 'legal' difficulties, in that anything we
legislated within Agora could be at odds with the Lambda 'laws'
themselves. How do you suppose we could work around that issue ?
Suppose we enact Rules whereby Voting in Agora is achieved via the
operation of some object in Lambda; suppose the Lambda Wizards
decide this object is too large, or too slow, and nuke it; what then?

In other words, the problem is that Agora would have no sovereingty
in Lambda. We could of course start a campaign in Lambda to have that
sovereignty granted to us, but I'm sure the answer would be 'why
don't you guys start your own MOO' ?

That is why I think the proper way to conduct such an experiment
would be on a territorry where Agora would have sovereignty, i.e. a
new MOO.

I don't know about the lamba program, but  their are publicly available
programs for MUDs that run on Linux.  The cost software time would be
minimal.  It would need a PC and band width.  I think the real drawback
is that we would not all be on the MUD at once.  One might come on only
to find e was by himself.  We might develop time based factions.  

I like Agora based in email.  How about more contests?

Well, that particular example is pretty silly given that we'd want to
keep non-embodied Players to be part of Agora still so making them
vote in LambdaMOO would hardly be consistent with that objective.
However, perhaps there are other examples, and it would be precisely
that conflict that would be interesting.  In just the same way that
real world legislatures can't usefully require pi to be equal to 3, we
would have to cope with the real world.

By definition, it seems to me that that wouldn't constitute an
experiment of the sort I'm interested in. 

On the other hand, from a quick scan of some LambdaMOO documentation,
it doesn't look as if theirs is a particularly interesting world to be
embodied in.  It doesn't really look as if there is an economy for
example.  It seems as if it is basically a gimmicky chat-room...

Hey-ho,

I tend to agree.  Agora's getting a bit staid.  Manipulating abstract

Yes, but LambdaMOO requires a really big machine; MOO has always been
a system hog.  As well as good high speed net access.  I don't think
any of us have the access, the machine, and the permission to use it
for that purpose.

And also being Contestmaster of a Contest does not mean that the

If you set up an interesting environment, there would be people
who came to the world for its environment.  They might or might not
participate in the Nomic aspects, but that's fine.  There's no reason
why Agora can't have jurisdiction over people who are not its Players.

So I've just read the Lambda MOO tutorial. And found one Lambda
related webpage, at <http://vesta.physics.ucla.edu/~smolin/lambda/>

Couldn't we try a simple and peaceful experiment by forming a contest
with all Agora players that are willing to participate in LambdaMOO?
This contest could then develope regulations that govern the behavior
of its members in the MOO, could conduct some of its business within
the MOO, etc.pp.

I'd be willing to give it a try.

What kind of character are you planning to have, Morendil? One somehow
connected with your Agora identity? I've been thinking about playing
a junior diplomat called Kolja L. Agorov or something like that. We
might even join the MOO as the Agorov brothers or something.

Well yes and no.  I don't think anyone would like to remove the
primacy of the mailing lists.  This would disenfranchise un-embodied
Players for one thing, and would also seem to be too much of a
capitulation to the external game.

Moving to Usenet would primarily be about changing the medium that we
used to communicate.  Moving into/onto a MUD would be about changing
our game's virtual substrate.

If Morendil is already joining the LambdaMOO game, I'd be interested
in hearing his thoughts about the game is like at some later stage.
Is the world sufficiently interesting to make us a good base? 

If it weren't for the fact that Shattered World has only 10-15
Players, I'd almost suggest moving there (they have an economic
system, for example).  Shattered World's existing rules also seem to
mix levels unfortunately.  One of them requires that some magical
ability or other behave slightly differently.  This is exactly the
sort of thing that a ruleset should avoid.  (Check rule 1008 and
others of the Common Laws available at
  http://gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au/~mud/laws/lawframe.htm). 

Michael.

Yes, exactly.  Lambda is a poor example of a virtual reality.  The LP
genre actually holds more promise for a virtual environment, because
LP players are more accustomed to engaging in scripted encounters with
the environment with an eye toward some goal.

Then the Assessor reports to the Assembly that "A Blue Bolt from the

heretofore cast with it.  I ask unanimous consent that a new election
be held, using <voting method X> instead."  Debate ensues, and a

There's certainly nothing to keep any of us who share a common
interest in MOOs to go exploring; as far as I'm concerned, why would
we even need a contest ? Until and unless things get to the point
where some kind of MOO activities can be somehow converted into
Agoran Currencies, we won't need much of a formal structure. In
fact, the only thing I think such a venture might require is a 
mailing list dedicated to it, since I suppose discussions of it would 
pretty soon bore the hell out of those of us not interested.

I don't have an 'Agora identity' as such; I have used the name
'Morendil' in all online activities ever since I've been online at
all (i.e. starting at the time Internet wasn't yet a household name
and online meant BBSes). I'll be 'Morendil' in LambdaMOO as well. I
guess you could say I just have this one 'online persona' and never
needed to create another.

Alternately, we could define the jurisdiction of Agora to include any
registered player in such a MOO. We already do this now, albeit in
the context of a mailing list; I don't see that operating AgoraMOO
would have to be any different. The advantage of AgoraMOO over
the current version would be that for a change it could be interesting
to participate in aspects other than Rule-making.

Well, I don't know - we could certainly implement mail-to-MOO
gateways, or even let non-resident Players give power of attorney to
other Players who are resident, in much the same way that a voter in
my country can arrange to be represented in an election by some other
voter when absent.

I don't know about interesting, but from what I've read it's a
tightly knit community. Registration isn't automatic but is tied to a
mechanism that keeps resource usage down, for instance, which makes
registered Players an elite of a sort. I very much doubt that it can
be 'invaded' even in a benign sense.

I still think the sovereignty issue would make any such experiment 
peter out after a short while unless we somehow managed to 'take
over' in the full sense an existing MOO; which, OTOH, we could
possibly get the original residents to consent to as an experiment,
e.g. Shattered World residents. Negotiating a 'merger' might be
fun, too.

One other thing we could to to reconcile your notion of how to go
about such an experiment and mine would be to recruit people who are
already MOOing somewhere else and have *them* join *our* world. What
do you think ? Instead of exporting Agora to a foreign territory, we
would be claiming fresh territorry but also import parts of an
existing culture. This could also work with Shattered World, I
suppose.

There  was most definitely talk about moving Agora to usenet.  However
someone wisely pointed out that the move would worsen some key problems
like messages out of order.

Laurent> LP ?

Stands for Lars Penske, the author of the lead implementation of the
genre.  (Actually, there's a diacrit on the 'e' but I don't remember
which one.)  LPMuds tend to be the hack-and-slash adventure variety
with many swashbuckling swordspeople going around and killing things
for "experience points" and treasures.  There tend to be towns in LP
worlds (sometimes only one), and it's these towns that open up the
opportunity for economic and political experimentation.  Shattered
World is, or at least was, an LP derivative.

I think the most exciting aspect is the ability to engage in actual
fact-finding as part of making judgments.  Did Ernest really sexually
harass Julia?  What should Ernest's punishment be?  If we ran a MUD
under our authority, in theory our law would need to deal with these
issues (at least, eventually).  And _that_ is what I find
fascinating.

I'm starting to understand why lawyers don't find Nomic very
interesting, by the way.  The sort of dry, logical wrangling that goes
on in Agora is not very much related to the business of doing law.

Now that I've actually created a SW character, I see what you mean. ;)

Yes, I agree wholeheartedly. The problem with Agora is that it is
almost entirely self-referential; the primary activity is tinkering
with the structural aspects of the game, and although that can be,
and has been, a lot of fun, it begins to get boring after a while.
Dissociating the structural and substantial aspects of the game
would be extremely beneficial, and a MOO-type system would
allow the game to actually have substantial aspects.

A curious side point: in the mid-1930s, the United States Supreme
Court apparently got tired of dealing with the structural aspects of
the "game" that is under their watchful eye, and, in a famous
footnote, called for a change of direction.  Prior to that time, most
major Supreme Court cases dealt with disputes relating to the
structure of the tripartite, federalistic government established by
the Constitution.  After that time, most major Supreme Court cases
dealt with disputes relating to the "preferred freedoms" established
in the Bill of Rights.  While the Supreme Court still addresses
structural issues from time to time, the "meat" of the Court's
jurisprudence is now (and has been for some time) the so-called "civil
rights."  (The turning point is found in Footnote Four of an otherwise
dreary case called _United States v. Carolene Products_.  Footnote
Four is one of only two footnotes of sufficient import to be generally
listed in glossaries of constitional law terminology.)

It should also be pointed out that if you create a half-way decent LP
mud, and advertise it on rec.games.mud.lp, you'll get players.  Most
of them will just run around your mud and kill things, but not all.
Besides, I personally don't care if most of our players are content to
not participate in the political process.  Agora needs something to
govern, since we've pretty much worked all the good issues out of
governing ourselves.  The obvious answer is to govern something
else. :)

Well - just to satisfy my curiosity, I've taken the plunge and gotten
Lambda up on the company's server. I'm impressed, in fact; the source
code compiled on the first try, the binary worked on the first try,
and the 'blank' setup has enough helpful stuff to get a complete
novice started.

Interested Players can have a look by telnetting to
   netdive.com:7777.
and entering "connect Guest" to connect as a Guest, or 'create' to
create a character. I have almost no idea where to go from there, but
it's a starting point. Actually, I'm not even sure _I_ should go
somewhere from there; the whole point should be to legislate things
such as room creation, etc. so that the whole Agoran community gets
involved from scratch. OTOH it's going to be tough to get something
going unless there's enough things set up so anyone can get a rough
idea how the thing works. Of course I and interested MOOers can
always create some stuff for a trial, then take the whole thing down
if/when Agora is ready to start using a MOO. Anyone with ideas how
to proceed please let me know.

I'll excerpt part of the opinion, and the footnote here, with
citations omitted to save space.  Note that the case was over a law
prohibiting the distribution of "filled milk", and has nothing to do
with "civil rights".

You can get the full text of the Court's opinion at
http://caselaw.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=304&invol=144.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

     UNITED STATES v. CAROLENE PRODUCTS CO., 304 U.S. 144 (1938)

				* * *

Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court. 

The question for decision is whether the 'Filled Milk Act' of Congress
of March 4, 1923, c. 262, 42 Stat. 1486, 21 U.S.C. 61-63, 21
U. S.C.A. 61-63,1 which prohibits the shipment in interstate commerce
of skimmed milk compounded with any fat or oil other than milk fat, so
as to resemble milk or cream, transcends the power of Congress to
regulate interstate commerce or infringes the Fifth Amendment.

				* * *

[Footnote 4] There may be narrower scope for operation of the
presumption of constitutionality when legislation appears on its face
to be within a specific prohibition of the Constitution, such as those
of the first ten Amendments, which are deemed equally specific when
held to be embraced within the Fourteenth.  [...]

It is unnecessary to consider now whether legislation which restricts
those political processes which can ordinarily be expected to bring
about repeal of undesirable legislation, is to be subjected to more
exacting judicial scrutiny under the general prohibitions of the
Fourteenth Amendment than are most other types of legislation. [...]

Nor need we enquire whether similar considerations enter into the
review of statutes directed at particular religious, [...] or
national, [...]  or racial minorities [...]; whether prejudice against
discrete and insular minorities may be a special condition, which
tends seriously to curtail the operation of those political processes
ordinarily to be relied upon to protect minorities, and which may call
for a correspondingly more searching judicial inquiry. [...]

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Several current doctrines of American constitutional law can trace
their origins, and in some cases their exact judicial formulation, to
Justice Stone's famous Footnote Four.

Or, Agora takes another direction. ;)

I've given a little more thought to the AgoraMOO idea, as I see it.
To make things easier I've tried to organize these reflections as an
incomplete and very rough Proto, liberally interspersed with
comments regarding theoretical issues, implementation notes, etc.

Proto-Proposal
---
The World of Agora

 I - Enabling legislation

 A Rule Category shall be created : "Agoran Physics".

 A Rule shall be created (titled "Agoran Physics: Generalities") with text : 

   There exists a 'virtual world' which permits the manipulation of
   virtual counterparts of Nomic and other Entities. This virtual world
   shall be implemented as a LambdaMOO server listening on port 7777
   operating on a host machine connected to the Internet at the address
   netdive.com. The Engineer, as described in other Rules, shall
   maintain and administrate this virtual world, which shall be known as
   AgoraMOO.

[[[ Comments :

This Rule is mainly for informational purposes, but also establishes 
the identity of the one and only 'real' AgoraMOO. It is necessary to 
fully specify the location of the server, otherwise one could run an 
alternate AgoraMOO somewhere else and claim that it, not the other 
one, was the one 'really' affecting Nomic Properties !

]]]

 A Rule shall be created (titled "Definition of Virtuals") with
 MI=4 and text : 

   It shall be legal to designate virtual entities of AgoraMOO as
   being a representation of Nomic Properties. In other words, the
   operation of the server program shall be a legal manner of
   affecting the Nomic Properties of Entities, and conversely, any
   modification of a Nomic Property shall be legally achieved by
   modifying such virtual entities in a corresponding manner.

   Entities and Properties of this kind shall be called Virtuals. Only
   Entities and Properites designated as such by the Rules, or by
   bodies of text to which the Rules grant such authority, shall be
   Virtuals, and the manner in which Virtuals and their properties
   correspond to Nomic Properties shall be described in the Rules or
   bodies of text to which the Rules grant such authority.

   Only Rules which are placed in the category "Agoran Physics"
   may so designate Entities or Properties, or define such 
   correspondences, or grant such authority to other bodies of
   text.

[[[ Comments

This establishes the basic correspondence between Agora and its
'physics'. Supposing that we pass a Rule which defines a Player's
Location to be the AgoraMOO room they currently reside in, then that
*is* the Player's Location, and if the operation of AgoraMOO allows
it, e may change eir Location simply by moving around in AgoraMOO.

The reason for the 'other bodies of text' clauses is that after a
while, we will have large chunks of definitions and Virtual entities
that apply solely within AgoraMOO; we need to be able to create
'Subordinate RuleSets' the text of which will be available in the
MOO, and just pass Rules stating "Text XYZ of AgoraMOO
describes a valid set of Virtuals". This is very similar to the way
the Rules grant SLCs the authority to define arbitrary Nomic
Entities.

The reason for the Category restriction will become apparent later 
on.

]]]

<<< Implementation notes

An initial challenge will be posed by 'special' Locations such as the
Stasis Chamber. We do not need to make Hold Status a Virtual
initially, since it shall remain simple enough to check the time when
a Player entered or exited the room. But we'll need code to implement
the 96-hour restriction. Also, if we want to leave non-participating
Players the possibility of going On Hold, i.e. by sending mail to the
Cartographor, we'll have to specify in the relevant Rule that while
Players who are in the SC are On Hold, Players who are On Hold are not
necessarily in the SC, but (for example) can and must be moved there
by the Cartographor ASAP.

>>>

 A Rule shall be created (titled "The Engineer") with text : 

   There shall exist an Office of the Engineer, with the duty of
   overseeing the operation of AgoraMOO. 

[[[ Comments :

The Engineer is the person who has the Wizard bit in AgoraMOO.
Initially there should be only one, who shall put any code required
to implement Physics Rules in place. This does not mean e must be the
only person able to write such code; for instance, Players interested
in helping with the code could download the current AgoraMOO files
(see 'Public Domain' Rule below), install them at home, play with
them as much as they like, write code to implement stuff, and pass
that code on to the Engineer who would then install it into the
'real' AgoraMOO. The Engineer would need to make a special copy of
the AgoraMOO files for that purpose, such that all users therein
would have the Wizard bit set. Or e would periodically save the
files, change eir password, and then publish the old password along
with the old file.

]]]

 A Rule shall be created (titled "The Universal Law of Physics") with 
MI=4 and text :

   Players are generally permitted to use the AgoraMOO program
   in any manner they choose; any action that can be effected by
   the means of connecting to the AgoraMOO program and typing
   text directed at the program is by definition possible and 
   permitted. The only exception to this Rule is the Engineer; e
   shall under no circumstances be permitted to alter AgoraMOO
   in any manner except as necessary to ensure that the
   correspondence between Nomic Properties and their Virtuals
   is respected, and shall otherwise be permitted to use only such
   commands as are available to other persons.

[[[ Comments :

This Rule is *the* crux and primary challenge of tying Agora to
AgoraMOO. All the fun consists of making sure the Rules and the
program are kept in synch, while at the same time allowing AgoraMOO
to be a concrete representation of Agora. Of course this means that
initially the Engineer will need a lot of trust placed in em, which
is why the "as necessary to ensure that"... clause should be
interpreted broadly, at least at the start. But I also provide
various mechanisms for keeping things sane or bailing out if things
get too too weird, see below.

]]]

 A Rule shall be created (titled "The Engineer's Blocking Veto") with text : 

   Any Proposal which would have as part of its direct effect the
   creation, repeal, amendment, or Category change of a Rule such that
   the Rule, before or after the change, belonged to the Category "Agoran
   Physics", shall if it passes take effect at the time the Engineer
   announces in a Public Forum that it has been implemented, and no
   sooner, any Rules to the contrary notwithstanding.

[[[ Comments :

As mentioned in one of the posts on the MOO topic, any Rule
pertaining to Agoran Physics will require writing some code, and the
time requirements on the persons writing that code (i.e. the Engineer
and any 'assistants' as might become necessary) must not get out of
hand. In addition, the Rules and the code must be kept in sync at all
times, so that it is never possible to "perform impossible actions" 
or be prevented from performing actions that the Rules dictate are
possible. This provides a very basic, but effective, mechanism
to achieve that. (Does this need MI>1 ?)

The Category restriction on Physics-affecting Rules will need to be
relaxed, and a correspondingly adjusted mechanism for delaying the
effect of Physics-related Proposals, if we later decide to tie in
some aspects of Agora to the MOO which belong in other Categories;
e.g. Kudos, which would be a nice and safe way to start down this
road.

]]]

A Rule shall be created (titled "Place Reality in the Public
Domain") with text : 

   The Engineer shall [periodically] publish [in some prescribed manner]
   the totality of the materials that are necessary for running
   AgoraMOO, and shall further be required to provide such materials to
   any Players upon request. Such materials are, irrevocably, and by
   unanimous consent of all persons participating in AgoraMOO, placed in
   the public domain, to the extent that applicable law permits.

[[[[

Make sure AgoraMOO can be restarted elsewhere, with a state close to
that of the actual Game State, if necessary. Also improves the
chances that there will be backup copies floating around. One
downside of this clause is that in AgoraMOO, *nothing* can be kept a
secret, since anyone can come along and find out where your
Player-Virtual is, what e's carrying, etc. Would this be a problem ?
There is also the problem of users' login passwords, but I seem to
recall reading that these are encrypted with a one-way function much
as Unix passwords are, so that having the DB doesn't do you any good
as far as finding a person's password.

The last bit is so that we are not claiming to modifiy the copryright
on the MOO itself, its source code or initial database.

]]]

 A Rule shall be created (titled "Ratification of Reality") with text :

   Any Player may annouce, Without Objection, that the Agoran
   Reality shall be Ratified. This has the effect, if no Objection is
   made, of conforming the Game State to the records embodied
   in the AgoraMOO files which were current at the time Reality
   is Ratified, in all particulars. No retroactive effects are 
   implied.

[Our old Ratification Rule, adapted to the MOO idea. I think 
Ratification would be crucially needed if Agora is to function
with AgoraMOO.]

 A Rule shall be created (titled "Escape Hatch") with MI=4 and text :

   Any Player may at any time declare, Without Objection, that
   a World Crisis has occurred. If no Objection is made, then all
   Rules in the Category "Agoran Physics" are suspended and
   shall have no legal effect, this Rule excepted, and shall remain
   suspended until such time as it a Player declares, Without 
   Objection, that the Crisis is over.

[[[[ Comments :

A very basic and brute-force mechanism for ensuring that if an
unfixable bug makes the AgoraMOO program unusable, or the server
goes down permanently, or the game files are lost or irrevocably
corrupted, or the Engineer turns Psychotic, or something else occurs
which makes AgoraMOO-related Entities and Properties unusable, they
will cease to have effect on the Game State and there is an
opportunity to take corrective action, or just get rid of AgoraMOO
and get on with life. Of course a more elaborate mechanism and more
elaborate safeguards become needed if/when we make Virtuals in other
Rule Categories, or make crucial things, such as Voting, dependent on
AgoraMOO to some extent (in such a case, Ratification of Reality
will also help minimize the impact).

]]]

*** IMPORTANT BITS THAT I'VE LEFT OUT

Draft Rules, and consider implementation, for a correspondence
between Agora Players and AgoraMOO users. This is a toughie, of
course. Rid the Proto of obvious loopholes (in particular relating to
the Engineer, e.g. the Engineer's Blocking Veto could seriously
handicap the safety features, or make it impossible to change eir
Salary without eir consent. Probably much more.

***



 II - Example of use : Locations

[[[

TBD. Bring back Locations, add language to equate a Location to a
MOO room, put them in "Agoran Physics", and let the Engineer create
the appropriate MOO objects. A more ambitious project would be to
implement Plots directly.

Comments:

I would allow the Engineer to specify the host and port of the MOO in
much the same manner that we handle the designation of Public Fora.
Requiring a Rule Change to change these could prove problematic should
a difficulty arise.

I think your "definition of virtuals" necessarily renders all
manipulations within the MOO as legal.  I do not believe this is
either necessary or appropriate, for two reasons.  One, it requires
the coders maintaining the MOO to scramble to keep the MOO code up to
date with the Rules.  This is what killed Nomic World.  Two, it takes
away entirely the interesting case of someone doing something that the
game engine allows, but which is prohibited of em by the law.  I would
prefer to allow the latter.

If the Rules prohibit anyone but the Assessor from entering the
Assessor's Office, I would prefer to have the MOO allow anyone else
to enter, and require the Assessor to pay for and install a lock, or
pay for and install a security monitoring system, or find some other
way to enforce the law.  Then when someone does break the law and
enter, s/he can be prosecuted and punished appropriately.  You would
require that the room magically lock itself when the Rule was adopted,
and magically unlock itself if and when the Rule is repealed.  This
means excess work for the game maintainers.  I don't want to have to
become an MOO expert in order to play Agora.

An aside: the use of Category to establish a Rule's authority will
make Category a substantive property of Rules; this has significant
effects which you may not have fully considered.  Tread carefully.

The Engineer shall be responsible for maintaining the world, of
course, but I do not believe that e should be responsible for making
the MOO detect all illegal actions.  Rather, the Wizard should have a
relatively free reign to operate the world as e sees best fit, subject
to the constraints established on _eir_ actions by the Rules and
Orders of the Electorate.

I must wholeheartedly disagree with you that "[a]ll the fun consists
of making sure the Rules and the program are kept in synch".  This has
been tried before, and it was an abject failure.  Ask Geoff.  Those
who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.

I recognize that you have attempted to give the Engineer an effective
veto power by refusing to implement changes.  I don't approve of
that.  It gives _too much_ power to the Engineer.  The changing of the
Office of Engineer requires a change to the MOO (passing off the
Wizard bit).  The Engineer could refuse to enact this change,
indefinitely, and thus remain Engineer forever, the will of the
Assembly notwithstanding.  That's a no go.  I advise avoiding this
path altogether.

In short, I think this is entirely the wrong approach.  I think the
MOO's "physics" should be indepedent of the Rules to the extent that
it makes sense of them to be.  The Rules should regulate the behavior
of the Players on the MOO, not the MOO itself.  (The MOO's physics can
be regulated--indirectly--by the Rules commanding the Engineer and eir
deputies or assistants to modify the physics of the MOO in some
specified way.)

That's OK with me - I only intended that Proto as a starting point
for discussion. The only problem I have with your idea of how we
should go about this is how would we then determine what the
'physics' of AgoraMOO should be ? If we don't want them to
'implement' the Rules but instead represent a more or less immutable
world within which Players can have actions that are regulated, who
is to define what this world should be, and how ?

One idea that comes to mind is to simply legislate that the Engineer
(or Engineers), to earn eir keep, will have to implement 'physics'
as dictated by the Agoran community as a whole via an
Application-derived mechanism whereby we would collectively
construct a 'spec' of what kind of world we would like; Engineers
would be allowed to tinker with AgoraMOO code only within the
bounds of such a mandate, which would be subject to a review
process whereupon a suitable financial reward would be granted
them. In effect, we would have a parallel democratic procedure
for altering the physics of our world - an appealing notion.

The next problem I have with your critiques is that they seem to
suggest AgoraMOO's overlap with Agora should be restricted to two
things, to wit a) the persons involved on both sides, be they
Players or guests and b) Agora's jurisdiction over AgoraMOO; while as
a matter of personal preference, I would very much like to see some
aspects of Agora, e.g. Kudos, be implemented via AgoraMOO. Am I
correct in this reading of your objections ? If so, I would also
like to elicit comment from other Player on which of the two options
they would prefer. But I do think either experiment would be quite
interesting.

I think your 'lock and key' example is interesting, because it brings
up the possiblity of granting arbitrary Players the authority to
create bits of AgoraMOO code, and sell the resulting objects to other
Players - i.e., if the Assessor feels up to the task, e could code
eir door lock emself, but e might also have the option of buying it
from someone else.

I still think however that initially the Engineer caste would have to
be given rather broad mandates, so that the system as a whole can be
tinkered with until we have a 'physics' of suitable flexibility to
allow intersting interactions. This raises another interesting
problem, which is how to prevent the Engineer caste from becoming too
entrenched in power.

Judging from the Nomic World experience, not so merry a time.

The solution is not to write legislation of that kind.

On the other Shattered World has a very interesting and complex 
environment, and it already has a Nomic running. So, what if...

My understanding from Geoff is that the Wizards simply ignore Rules
like R1008.

Why is it a problem that Shattered Word has only 10-15 Players?
(Actually I think there are more, but only 10-15 participate in
the Nomic.)

In Nomic World, temporality was a factor, but not an issue. It's
much easier to organize a conspiracy with people in compatible time
zones, but that's already true in Agora as it is.

It would make groups more complicated but perhaps a Group could be required
to mint a currency called a Stock.  Any who owns Stock in a Group is a
member of the Group. For purposes of determining net worth, each member is
considered to own a portion of the Group's assets based on the amount of
stock e owns.

Indeed.  I can recall spending more than one late night up conspiring

Is that a typo, or did you really roll an 8 sided die to select from
among 9 Players? If so, Murphy has been effectively and illegally made
ineligible to serve as Justice.

The Engineer would have broad discretion in this regard.  However, the
Electorate could express its desires by requiring (by Rule or Order)
the Engineer to construct or modify the world in some specific manner.
I've not come up with a good means for the Engineer to object to an
requirement as being impossible or impractical, but I'm sure something
can be worked out.  (A CFJ could be used; the trick is writing the
enabling legislation to excuse the Engineer from abiding by
requirements adjudicated impractical or impossible.)

The failure of the Engineer to comply is a Criminal matter subject to
factual adjudication.

I'm rather strongly opposed to moving existing mechanisms to an
on-line environment.  I like our current email format and do not wish
to lose it.  Furthermore, as a programmer I am acutely aware that
programs crash.  I am therefore uncomfortable turning game
functionality over to a program.  ("Oops, the mud just crashed
again.  I hope the votes aren't lost this time.")

They need not even be Players.  In the model I suggest below, they
might merely be enterprising Citizens. :)

My suggestion for enabling legislation follows:

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Be it therefore resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      There shall exist the Office of Gamemaster.

      The Gamemaster shall operate an electronic virtual reality of a
      sort which allows individuals participating in the virtual
      reality to interact with each other and with the virtual
      environment.  The nature of this environment and the manner of
      its operation shall be at the discretion of the Gamemaster,
      within the boundaries established by the Rules.  This virtual
      reality may be referred to within the Rules as the EVR.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      Individuals who participate in the EVR (who may be referred to
      in the Rules as "Citizens") are required to abide by these Rules
      as if they were Players, whether or not they are Players.

      This Rule shall not be construed so as require Citizens to be
      Players or Players to be Citizens, although any individual may
      elect to be both a Player and a Citizen, at eir discretion.

Dear me. Whoever could that have been?

I've been following the Shattered World thread with interest. My
sympathies are basically with Scott and Michael. But I have a fairly
radical proposal: we could attempt a merger with Shattered World Nomic.

By this I mean that we could attempt to merge the Agoran Ruleset with
the Laws of Shattered World, to the benefit of both communities. Most of
Agora's Ruleset is concerned with its own procedures, and so I think
could be fairly painlessly absorbed into Shattered World. Shattered
World already has some Laws of its own, particularly its Common Laws,
which make reference to items peculiar to Shattered World. Any merger
would have to substantially preserve those Laws. Much of Shattered
World's Mutable and Immutable Laws, however, are pretty much unchanged
from early versions of Suber's Initial Set - actually, they seem to be
minor variants of the Nomic World Ruleset as it came to be - and I
imagine that some of these could be superseded by the more sophisticated
versions in the Agoran Ruleset, while for others that might not be such
a good idea.

As for how to achieve it, persuasion rather than force is the way
to go. I think we have something significant to offer Shattered World,
namely, a large group of new citizens. And they have something to offer
us, namely, a rich and variegated world. Together, we could make
something beautiful, or at least very interesting.

If we got the go ahead, we'd want to establish some kind of committee,
made of Players from both Nomics, to look at both Rulesets and create
a new, composite Ruleset, preserving the flavour of both, with the idea
that the new Ruleset would be adopted as the new Shattered World Law.
