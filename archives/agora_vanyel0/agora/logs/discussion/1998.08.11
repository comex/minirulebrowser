Since Morendil has referred several times in his proto-Judgement to the
draft version of my Judgement I've been circulating privately, I thought
I should post that. 

======================================================================
                               CFJ 1100

  Player Swann committed the crime of Contempt by Action.

======================================================================

Judge:        lee
Judgement:    FALSE


Decision of the Speaker:

I hereby SUSTAIN lee's Judgement that the Statement is FALSE.

This Judgement is in three sections. In the first section, I explain the
substance of lee's Judgement; in the second, I consider three arguments
against the Judgement, and reject them all; in the third, I consider the
role of the Board of Appeals.

1. The substance of lee's Judgement.

Let us begin by examining lee's Judgement itself. On the key question on
which the Appeal turns, Judge lee was in his actual Judgement almost
telescopically brief. Since the Order issued by Macross were Private
Orders (which no-one denies), Judge lee argued that:

      Since they were Private Orders, they are executed by submission
      directly to the Player to be commanded, as per Rule 1808/0.  Since
      these were submitted to the Public Forum rather than directly to
      Player Swann, these orders were never executed and never took
      effect.

Thus Judge lee interpreted the phrase "submitting them directly" in
R1808 as requiring that Private Orders be submitted directly to the
subject of the Order, as opposed to being communicated via the Public
Forum. From this follows the obvious conclusion that Macross never
Ordered Swann to do anything, and so that Swann could not have committed
the Crime of Contempt by Action. This act of interpretation was merely
implicit in his Judgement. But it was explicit in a defence of his
Judgement lee posted to the business list the following day, in which he
said:

      In particular, i looked at the way the word directly is used in
      Rule 1808/0. In other many places in the Rules, there are
      specifications about Nomic Entity being submitted to another Nomic
      Entity, such as a Player or an Officer.  Only in this Rule does it
      specify that something a Nomic Entity is to be submitted directly.
      The phrase is unique. However i did not find it ambiguous.

      I reasoned that if posting a statement to the Public Forum saying
      it was an Order to a Player were sufficient to execute an order,
      then the language of Rule 1080/0 would be more like the language
      that specifies how Appeals are submitted to the CotC, or more like
      the language in many other Rules. In addition, if there were no
      other more direct way to contact a Player, then the language in
      Rule 1080/0 would be ambiguous. 

      In an Official report, the Registrars Report, the email address of
      each Player is given.  Thus, in an official document, a way to
      directly contact a Player, other than a message to their attention
      in the Public Forum, is given.

      To me it was unambiguous that according to Rule 1080/0 that
      Private orders had to be submitted not simply to the Public Forum,
      but rather to that Player in a more direct fashion.  Since the
      Rule seemed clear to me, i could not even consider game custom. I
      knew my ruling would be inconvenient, but i felt compelled by the
      Rules to judge the way that I did.  I gave this more consideration
      than some Players would have, and for that I have been insulted in
      the Public forum.


2. Arguments against the Judgement considered, and rejected.

This reasoning, and the Judgement more generally, has been attacked on
three separate grounds. I propose to deal with these in order from the
least serious to the most serious grounds.

Firstly, it has been argued that if the Judgement is allowed to stand,
then a great many Private Orders, including a very large number of
Transfer Orders, will turn out to have been invalid, with consequences
for the game state that will at the very least be difficult and at worst
impossible to calculate. This is true, but it is not an argument for
overturning the Judgement. Agora has suffered crises of this kind before
and survived them. We do not yet know how much work recalculating the
game state will be. Perhaps it will turn out to be achievable after all,
and we might decide to attempt it. Or we might decide not to attempt it,
or discover that the task is impossible, (for example, because we have
no records of whether certain messages were sent to the PF or privately
to Recordkeepors), in which case we might be forced to Ratify portions
of the game state using the Ratification (or some other) mechanism.
We've done it before, and if necessary we can do it again. And in any
case, some Players have recently been arguing that we don't have to
correct mistakes made in the past but can just let them be and move on
(compare the response to Kolja's Judgement of CFJ 1101).

Secondly, it has been argued that lee's Judgement conflicts with prior
Judgements, in particular with the Judgements returned in CFJs 1094,
1095, and 1097, all of which confirmed that the various Orders issued in
connection with the Coup d'Étât were legal and valid Orders. However,
none of the Judges in those CFJs considered the question of the correct
interpretation of R1808 which lee raises in his Judgement. One way of
seeing this situation would be to say that since those Judgements
address different questions, the question of conflict between the
Judgements simply does not arise. A different way of seeing the
situation would be to say that if the point lee is making is correct,
then the prior Judges were simply in error in finding those Orders to be
legal and valid. But on either way of seeing it, lee's Judgement
deserves to be considered on it's own merits.

But what are those merits? The third and most serious challenge to the
validity of lee's Judgement alleges that lee did in fact err in law, in
that he ignored the requirement placed on Judges by R217 to consider
game custom. The argument runs that since the meaning of R1808 is
unclear, game custom should have led the Judge to conclude that Private
Orders can be legally executed by submitting them to the Public Forum
since this has been our common practice. This argument can only be as
compelling as is its premise that R1808 is unclear. Judge lee considered
this question in the defense of his Judgement, quoted above. He said
that the wording of the Rule appeared to him to be unambiguous, and
hence that game custom did not enter into the question. He is certainly
correct in his understanding of R217: if the wording of R1808 is clear,
then not only did lee not have to consider game custom, he was not
permitted by the Rules to do so, and was in fact compelled, as he
claimed to be, to Judge according to the clear meaning of the text of
R1808, in spite of game custom.

But is the meaning of R1808 clear? A definitive answer to that question
is probably impossible. Judgements of clarity are a vague and subjective
matter, about which rational people may disagree. But even judgements
about matters of taste can be more or less arbitrary. It is proper for
the Board of Appeals to ask: was lee's judgement that R1808 is clear a
judgement that a reasonable person was entitled to make? My view as a
Justice is that Judge lee was entitled to take the view of R1808 that he
did. The construal he gave of the word "directly" as it appears in that
Rule is in my view by far the most natural interpretation available to
him. No other candidate interpretation comes close enough to this one
to being reasonable to make the Rule ambiguous. Therefore, lee was
within his rights as Judge to view R1808 as being clear, and hence to
ignore game custom.


3. The role of the Board of Appeals.

This Appeal affords me a welcome opportunity to expand upon views I have
already stated elsewhere about the proper role of the Board of Appeals.
As is probably well known by now, I have often stated (as I did, for
example, in my Judgement of the Appeal of CFJ 921) that one should be
reluctant to overturn Judgements unless they are mistaken in law or set
a bad precedent. In this Judgement we have another application of that
principle. My own views on the clarity or unclarity of R1808, whether
they are in agreement with lee's or not, are not to the point. What is
important is whether lee's view was one that a reasonable person was
entitled to take of the situation. In making his Judgement, what lee has
really done is contribute a creative act to the game, a considered act
borne out of his own particular set of aesthetic responses to the
situation. In my view the proper role of the Board of Appeals is to
encourage such creative contributions to the game by respecting them as
much as possible.

We seem to be at odds this week, Morendil. I don't think you've done
nearly enough here to show that Kolja's Judgement should be overturned.
What you need, and what you haven't provided, is a case in which (a)
another Rule uses the word 'specific' or 'specifically' in much the same
way that the word is used in R1567, and (b) game custom has clearly
allowed Players to refer to entities of the kind to which the Rule
refers, but in a non-specific way, the wording of the Rule
notwithstanding.

I take 'being specific' to mean 'picking out a particular entity or
entities in a non-ambiguous way'. So I don't think that your first
example ("I hereby abstain on all Proposals up for vote") even is an
example of failure to be specific. "All Proposals up for vote" picks out
a bunch of Proposals perfectly unambiguously, and so is specific. Your
second example ("I hereby delegate the Office of Assessor to whomever is
willing to take it.") is, at least potentially, an example of failure to
be specific (if there is more than one willing Delegate), but where is
the evidence that game custom has ever allowed this statement on its own
to constitute a Notice of Delegation?

I repeat my simple claim that "all CFJs called in the next month" does
not name a specific CFJ, as required by the explicit wording of R1567.
I find it surprising that anyone should seriously want to deny this.

How many other meanings of 'directly' do you know ? Webster lists :

1. In a direct manner; in a straight line or course.
2. In a straightforward way; without anything intervening; not by secondary, but by direct, means. 
3. Without circumlocution or ambiguity; absolutely; in express terms. 
4. Exactly; just. 
5. Straightforwardly; honestly. 
6. Manifestly; openly. [Obs.] 
7. Straightway; next in order; without delay; immediately.
8. Immediately after; as soon as. 

I had to look it up to be aware that it could even conceivably be 
interpreted as "only". The meaning of 'without intervening steps'
is the 'clear' meaning of that term, as far as I'm concerned, not 4.

So ? Your roommate is as entitled as you are to read messages off 
your answering machine, so in a sense messages sent to that machine
are sent to both of you.

Because that's not what 'directly' means in its primary acceptation ?
Compare with other uses in the Rule, such as "direct or indirect 
effect of a Proposal".

Ask the Archivist, not me. I remember several instances. I may also
add that "I Delegate to X, if willing", which you will certainly
remember has been used frequently, can be considered to 'specify' an
entity which may or may not exist, depending on whether X is willing
or not. It has always irked me somewhat that we are willing to allow
such vague designations when the Rules ask for a successor to be
'specified', just as it annoys Kolja to see Rule 1567 used in that
way. I just don't feel like sustaining a Judgement where a decision
is not only at odds with game custom but based on personal preference
and nothing else.

I have always found it surprising that "I delegate Office X to Y, if
e is willing" should be accepted as "specifying" a Player. I favor
consistency in this regard, though. Should this Board return a
decision favoring more stringent criteria, I shall bring to the
Courts any cases where I deem specification to have been
vague. Otherwise, the Ruleset will become absolutely opaque.

In fact, I now tend to be of the opinion that Rule 1808 should be
interpreted as "it is acceptable, as an exception to the general
rule, to send such messages to the recipient only, rather than to the
Public Forum". IOW, as guidance rather than as prohibition.

OK, but you should realize the significance of this concession. The two
objections I raised to your proto-Judgement are not completely
independent of each other. If you concede that lee was entitled to view
the Rule as having a clear meaning contrary to game custom, then you
must accept that lee was entitled to disregard game custom in reaching
his Judgement. The entire weight of your disagreement with lee then
comes to rest on the question of whether lee's interpretation of Rule
1808 was correct, and not on the question of game custom.

I also want to add that even the existence of a controversy about the
meaning of a Rule is not sufficient to guarantee that a Rule is unclear.
You have to enquire as the nature of the controversy. I would describe
the present case, for example, as one where the controversy has arisen
not because a Rule is unclear, but because the consequences of a
Judgement are considered to be unpalatable.

I think this way of thinking about the possible meaning of 'direct' is
unhelpful, even wrong. I think we have to deny that the addition of one
more relay between A and B would make A's submission to B any less
direct, in the sense of 'direct' which ought to be at issue. Otherwise
we risk denying that any message is ever sent directly unless it passes
from A to B without any intervening relays at all, a condition that will
rarely if ever be met by messages being transmitted on the Internet.
Such a candidate interpretation of 'directly' is one of those which I
think lee was correct to exclude in his considerations. It's not close
enough to being reasonable in the context to make the word ambiguous or
unclear.

I disagree with this claim also. R1859 requires that the message be
*sent* to the Vote Collector only, not that it be received by the Vote
Collector only. If other persons end up reading a voting message which
was not sent to them, then that will not affect the validity of the
message according to R1859.

But why use a problematic interpretation of 'directly' in terms of the
number of relays between sender and receiver, when lee's perfectly good
alternative interpretation in terms of number of recipients is
available, and does not lead to such subtle and shifty problems?

>In any case, I stand by my contention that "directly to X" and "only to

And I stand by my contention that they are related by logical
implication: the latter implies the former.

Really?  So, do you think I should redo the selection of the Judge for
CFJ 1102 with Antimatter and Harlequin off the list?

Huh?  Shattered World residents don't have any control over the
Wizards, and thus no control over the physics.  This contrasts with
our control of a system like AgoraMOO.

OK, I agree that the task of setting up the world for our use would be
easier in AgoraMOO.  I don't understand your last comment about
enforcement though.  If we actually wanted humans to be city guards
(as opposed to robots), then we could get Agorans to do this whether
or not we were playing in AgoraMOO or SW.

This is my suggestion that we set up a MUD and take on the role of
Gods, not Players.  We'd still have a physical world to play with, but
it would make sense for us to be able to control it.  The problem with
this is that it really requires us to go out there and recruit players
for the MUD.   (I've attached my proto from way back when.)

Michael.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
              *** Polis (or the Agora sub-universe) ***

Let a rule be created with the title "Polis and the Strategos" and the
following text:

As soon as practically possible, there shall be created a MUD-like
implementation of a "world", open to the general Internet public.
This world shall be known as "Polis", and will be the collective
responsibility of the Players of Agora.  However, the day to day
maintenance and development of Polis will be the responsibility of a
new elected Officer, the Strategos.

Further rules will dictate characteristics of Polis, but insofar as
the rules do not constrain them, the Strategos is free to implement
Polis as they see fit.  The Strategos necessarily must have access to
a suitable computer to serve as the site for the Polis MUD.

Players in the Polis MUD are to be known henceforth as Mortals.

--------------------

Let a rule be created with the title "Duties of the Strategos" and the
following text:

The Strategos shall implement and maintain the Polis MUD system.  The
Strategos is responsible for both the day-to-day running of the MUD,
and also for changes to the implementation required by changes to
Agoran Law.  The Strategos may be made responsible for other duties
relating to Polis by other rules.

The Strategos must maintain a log of their actions, and must make a
Report of their activities every week.

--------------------

Let a rule be created with the title "Access to Polis" and the
following text:

In general, anyone capable of it must be allowed to connect to Polis
and become a Mortal.  Agora Players may also become Mortals, but must
report both the fact that they are doing so, and the name under which
they are doing so, to the Strategos.  Further, the Strategos is given
leave to ban and/or expel Mortals who, in the Strategos' judgement,
are endangering the long-term technical viability of the MUD system,
or who are acting in a persistently obnoxious fashion.  These
decisions are necessarily subject to Judicial Review within the usual
Agoran channels.

--------------------

Let a rule be created with the title "Polis in abeyance" and the
following text:

For various reasons (such as loss of access to the hosting site for
the Polis MUD), it may occasionally become necessary for Polis to be
put in abeyance or discontinued.  If this happens, the Strategos is
responsible for preservation of as much of the state of Polis as
possible, and for the speedy resurrection of the game afterwards.

All rules governing aspects of Polis only do so when Polis is active;
when in abeyance Polis is static and by default not subject to rules
about Polis.  This condition defers only to those Rules that
explicitly seek to override it.

The Gods of Shattered World happen to be SW resident. I should know,
I'm speaking with one at this moment, getting him to fix some physics.

Yeah, sure, but they are not normal residents.  I think Agoran players
should be normal residents of their MUD, not Gods.

How do you mean, not normal ? They're normal, apart from being
Gods... :) AFAIK even the higher levels have to eat etc. Most of
them appear to have several characters, secondaries with lesser
powers, though. But note that one is essentially a God by virtue of
having access to the server in an administrative function; this does
not necessarily prevent the characters 'incarnating' the Gods from
being subject to (most of) the same laws as mere mortals.

The problem in AgoraMOO is that by allowing abnormal Players (i.e.,
those have a humans behind them that have wizardly powers in the MUD),
is that Agora then has untoward influence on the physics of the game.
Those characters that have Gods behind them may well be subject to the
normal physics of the game, but the God like powers they have
(indirectly) may well result in adjustments to the physics that we
shouldn't be able to make. 

Specifically, if you are an Engineer or something for AgoraMOO, then a
faction of sufficiently motivated Players might decide that they
wanted to be able to fly.  They pass a law to that effect, and
suddenly, you as an Agoran player are required to implement it.  For
one thing, that's a hassle for you, and two, it makes a mockery of the
idea of the ruleset being embodied in a reality because the ruleset
is patently able to reach outside itself and fiddle with physics. 

I admit that in Shattered World, we would still need to enshrine
(perhaps as a very high Power rule) the principle that rules governing
the behaviour of characters in the MUD should not seek to govern the
behaviour of the people behind them.  Otherwise, we could pass rules
saying "If a Mortal whose controlling person is also a God should
enter Merenth, then that player must use their Godly powers to give
all Agoran Mortals 100 gold pieces."

And yes, the obvious corollary is that we could set up a similar rule
for AgoraMOO (something along the lines of "No rule shall attempt to
prescribe the behaviour of the Engineer"), but then, there are other
advantages to SW: it has lots of other players, an existing physics
and an economy as well.  AgoraMOO has none of these things, and I
believe that they are all quite difficult to get. 

Michael.

We could, given enough time, get an economy and physics on AgoraMOO.
However, I do not believe that we have the manpower to do this in any
reasonable timeframe.  Getting players is even more of a challenge.

Further, the role of the Engineer in the AgoraMOO scenario above may
come to attract accusations of partiality in a way that third party
(e.g., SW) Gods and wizards shouldn't.

How frequently does SW require you to eat?  Once every several hours
shouldn't be too excessive.

I think that should be a guiding principle.  It is sufficiently

General Chaos However, I do not believe that we have the manpower to do

challenge.

I'm not giving up on AgoraMOO, I don't see  being a programmer as being

AgoraMOO.

I'm not disputing that; I'm saying that SW, and SW Nomic 
specifically, has the exact same problem, and they don't seem
to be much affected by it. I've seen some people fly (on Roc
back), but the ability is available to any player. Where do you
see a difference ?

But aren't SW Gods and wizards then suspect of that same partiality,
only with the added disadvantage that such partiality is in favor of 
native SWers ?

Assuming that they are partial in such a way, that still won't affect
the power-relationships between Agorans.  If the Engineer in AgoraMOO
is an Agoran, then they may be subject to suspicions of partiality in
the same way that a SW God might be supposed to be partial on behalf
of their secondary characters.

This isn't true.  The Players in the existing Sanom City nomic do not
have the ability to compel the Gods/Wizards to do anything.  As Steve
said a while ago, when they do pass laws that aim to affect physics,
the Wizards ignore them.  If we join SW, we will not be able to pass a
law saying that we should be able to fly and expect the Wizards to
implement it for us.  

If we play AgoraMOO, we can, because the Engineer will be an Agoran
player and subject to the rules.  SW and AgoraMOO *are* different.

Michael.

If the Engineer were a Player of Agora, then they'd have to follow the
rules (check R101), so they'd need the protection of a high power rule
such as the one I propose.

There's no point to working on AgoraMOO communally unless there is
some general idea about where we'd want to take it.  Have you got an
idea about the general physics of the game?  Have you figured out some
form of conflict resolution (combat, say)?  What happens to a
character if they're killed/toaded etc?  Shouldn't there be some sort
of restriction on people's abilities to build things; (resources *are*
finite, right)?  If I build things, do I need to go and get building
materials first?  If I build things, should other people be able to
destroy them? (*)

AgoraMOO needs to be more than the "gimmicky chat room" of something
like LambdaMOO if it is to be of any interest from the nomic (ruleset)
perspective.  It might well turn into a cool place to socialise for
Agoran members, but it will be legislatively dull.

Michael
(*) These questions are not necessarily answered well in SW, but of
    course, in AgoraMOO you are in a position to answer them even
    better because you are doing everything from scratch.

The problem in this instance is not the other players whining to the
Engineer, but rather the Engineer altering the fabric of the universe
to favour their cronies, or even being under suspicion of doing such.

This is not really a major problem IMO.  I'm sure we can trust
Morendil (say) to do a good job.  The real problems are the lack of
infrastructure on AgoraMOO compared to what is already available
on SW.

I have a quota, in raw bits i am limited to what i can own, so from my
perspective resources are limited. Even if i sell my objects,  until
the wizard decides otherwise, it stays in my count.  I delight every
day in discovering the physics of the MOO and working with them.   It
is up to the wizard to decide what to do with the toads, and the dead
as this is beyond my power.  I do think that it is vital that we
recognize that telling the wizard e must do something is futile, and i
we need a rule to do so be it.

I hope we will legislate a better system than combat in order to settle
disputes.  I think the legislation of the MOO should be separate from
the rules, but of course Players are always subject to the Rules.

The builder systems definitely have something compared to the LP-like
systems in this respect.  (I don't think normal players on SW are able
to build anything at all.) However, as it stands, there's not much for
our rules to grab hold of in such a system.  So let's think: what sort
of economy do we have here?

Clearly people can create added value by creating things that other
Players desire.  However, the issue of ownership doesn't seem clear.
Only the creator of an object can destroy it, and object creators can
only create a finite number of objects.  Real estate is another form
of object, so subject to the same sort of problems. 

Second question: how can your objects affect other Players?

Combat is a very interesting dispute resolution method.  It certainly
has its flaws, but it would be interesting to legislate for.  It also
has the virtue of perhaps giving the game a little extra spice. 

Can AgoraMOO implement differing coinage systems easily? 

Michael.

The Gods and Wizards are themselves citizens of SW and subject to the

They can, by buying a home. Building inside one's property is 
unrestricted.

This can - and probably shall - be changed.

They are already partly implemented.

This is not what Steve said.  It also doesn't make any sense.  The SW
nomic is the part of the SW MUD that corresponds to the Sanom City
area.  It doesn't even have jurisdiction over those Players that don't
have anything to do with the city in the course of the game.  Being
Gods/Wizards puts you above the Sanom City law because the law there
is a creation of the Players, and can't possibly compel beings as
exalted as Gods and Wizards. 

Michael.

As in most cases, the relevant Officer needs to use eir best judgement

The SW gods and wizards consider themselves beyond the reach of mortal
law, be it Sanom City or any other.  And I don't think they'd think of
us as any less "native".

Proto-proposal: Seperation of the Agora MUD
----
Create a rule with Power=2 titled "Seperation of the Agora MUD" which
reads:

      No Rule or Proposal may require, coerce, or punish a player in any
      way for actions taken in the capacity of wizard of the Agora MUD or
      MOO, if one exists. This Rule takes priority over all other Rules.
----

Would that answer people's objections?

I am mystified as to how you arrive at this interpretation from the text
of the Rule:

      Private Orders are executed by submitting them directly to the
      Player to be commanded, and take effect upon submission.

I think is a poor example to be discussing in connection with CFJ 1101.
R1645 nowhere uses the word 'specific'. Here's what it does say:

      An Office is legally Delegated if and only if the following
      conditions are met:

      (i)   the Delegating Player has posted to the Public Forum a
      Notice of Delegation, naming the Office being Delegated and the
      Delegated Player;

As you can see, what R1645 requires is that the Player be named. So "I
delegate the Office of Assessor to Chuck, if he is willing" is fine as a
Notice of Delegation, provided that we're prepared to accept the use of
the conditional. But our acceptance of (some) conditional actions is a
completely separate issue from that of vagueness or ambiguity in
specification, and the two issues should not be confused.

I don't know what you should do. Our past practices are probably
inconsistent so you might as well do as you please.

Be careful to distinguish the rules of SW from the Laws of SW. My 
understanding is the Gods make no pretence of being being bound by
Laws, and they agree to be guided (but no more) by the Rules. They
reserve the right to be capricious at all times, but they exercise
that right only infrequently and in cases where they are particularly
annoyed.

Have I got thet roughly correct, Geoff?

I think you're missing my point. I'm also appealing to the meaning
"without intervening steps" - but this requires further interpretation:
what kinds of steps are meant? What I'm saying is if I'm required to
send something "directly" to you, then in the context in which most
messages are sent to the Public Forum, it makes sense to think that what
I'm required to do is not to send the message to the PF, but to you.
Sending it to you via the PF would be a forbidden intervening step.

What you seem to be saying is that we should interpret "without
intervening steps" as meaning "without the message being relayed among
machines on the Internet", which, given the context of the game, I don't
think is a very sensible interpretation.

The point is arguable. What if the message explicitly stated "This is a
message for Assessor Steve. I vote for Proposal 6666."? Would you still
claim that the message had been sent to my housemate?j
