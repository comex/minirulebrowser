Protoproposal Chaos33 [rev. 2]

The Industrial Revolution

Be it therefore resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      Certain entities, or classes of entities, may be designated as
      Possessions by the Rules.

      Every entity which is designated as a Possession has an Owner.
      If no other record exists of the Owner of a given Possession,
      its Owner is the Bank.

      Any entity which possesses any Possession, but which does not
      have an Executor nor is already in Probate, shall be placed in
      Probate.

      The Owner of a Possession may transfer the Ownership of that
      Possession to any other entity capable of owning Plots by
      sending a message to the Officer responsible for maintaining the
      record of Ownership of that Possession.  The message shall
      unambiguously identify the Possession to be transferred and the
      entity who is to receive ownership of that Possession.  The
      change of ownership is effective at the time the message is
      sent, unless the message specifies a later time.

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 896 be amended by deleting the
paragraph reading "When a Player registers, eir Location is the
Welcoming Center." 

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1016 be amended by replacing
"Moves to the Stasis Chamber" with "announces that e does so in the
Public Forum", and by replacing "Moves from the Stasis Chamber" with
"announces that e does so in the Public Forum".

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1664 be amended by deleting the
words "whose Location is the Beer Hall".

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1711 be amended to read,

      A Degree that has been Granted becomes awarded when the
      recipient notifies the Speaker (or eir Delegate, as described
      below) that e accepts the Degree.

      When a Degree is Granted to a recipient who is not a Player, the
      Speaker shall promptly inform the recipient that e has been
      Granted the degree by some means which has a reasonable
      likelihood of reaching the recipient.  The Speaker may Delegate
      this duty to any other willing Player.

Be it further resolved, that Rules 1706, 1707, 1708, and 1709 be
repealed, and further that any and all Locations still remaining in
existence are destroyed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1710 be amended to read,

      There shall exist the Office of Cartographor.  The Cartographor
      shall retain the records of Ownership of Plots and of Factories.

      The Official Report of the Cartographor shall contain:
      * the Location and Ownership of every Plot
      * the Placement and Ownership of every Factory

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      A Location is an ordered pair of integers.  The first of these
      two integers is the Longitude of that Location, and the second
      is the Latitude.  No Longitude may be less than the Minimum
      Longitude nor greater than the Maximum Longitude.  No Latitude
      may be less than the Minimum Latitude nor greater than the
      Maximum Latitude.  Initially, the Minimum Longitude and Minimum
      Latitude are both 0, and the Maximum Longitude and Maximum
      Latitude are both 10.  Any of these may be changed
      (independently of the others) by the action of any Instrument of
      Power 1 or greater, or by the Cartographor Without Objection,
      but in no case may the Minimum Longitude be greater than the
      Maximum Longitude, nor may the Minimum Latitude be greater than
      the Maximum Latitude.

      For each possible Location (as detailed above) there exists
      exactly one Plot.  Plots are Possessions.

      A Plot may contain Currencies.  For the purposes of the Rules, a
      Plot's Executor is the same as the Executor of its Owner.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      Factories are a class of entities which may be placed upon
      Plots.  At most one Factory may be placed upon a Plot, and every
      Factory is placed on at most one Plot.  The Plot upon which a
      Factory is placed is called its Placement.  

      The Owner of a Factory which is not placed upon a Plot may place
      it upon any Plot which does not already contain a Factory.  The
      Owner of a Factory which is placed upon a Plot may remove it
      from that Plot.  The Owner of a Plot may remove any Factory
      placed upon it.  All of these are accomplished by the Owner of
      the Factory (or the Plot, in the third case) by sending a
      message to the Cartographor unambiguously specifying what is to
      be done.

      Factories are Possessions.  

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      Each Factory is of a particular Design, and once created as a
      Factory of that Design cannot be changed to a Factory of another
      type.  

      Every Factory consumes and produces units of Currency according
      to its Design.  The Design for each Factory specifies an input
      of a positive number of units of a Currency, and an output of a
      non-negative number of units of a Currency (which need not be
      distinct from that of the input).

      At the beginning of each Nomic Week, if, in the Plot where a
      Factory is placed, there exist at least as many units of the
      input Currency as called for by that Factory's Design, and that
      Factory is Active, the Factory destroys that many units of the
      input Currency and creates the number of units of the output
      Currency as specified in the Design.  The units of Currency thus
      destroyed are taken from, and the units of Currency thus created
      are added to, the Plot in which the Factory is Placed.

      Any Factory which has, for the entire preceding Nomic Week, been
      Placed in the same Plot, is Active.  All other Factories are
      Idle.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      A Factory with a given Design may only be created by the Mintor
      of the Output Currency called for by that Design. 

      In order to create a Factory, the Mintor of the Output Currency
      called for in that Design must destroy 4 Ergs, specifying that e
      does in a message sent to both the Recordkeepor of Ergs and to
      the Cartographor.  This message must also specify for the
      Cartographor the Design of the Factory thus created.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      The following standard Factory Designs exist:

      Mine:   Input is 1 Erg, output is 3 Ergs.
      House:  Input is 1 Erg, output is 1 P-Note.
      Farm:   Input is 1 Erg, output is 1 VT.
      Church: Input is 1 Erg, output is 0 or more Indulgences, as
      specified elsewhere.

      The Bank may not create any Factory with a Design other than
      those given by this Rule.

      The Bank, upon the request of any entity who also successfully
      transfers 4 Ergs to the Bank for the purpose of making that
      request, shall create a Factory of any of these designs and
      shall transfer ownership of the Factory thus created to the
      entity thus requesting.

I don't notice any difference between this and the last revision. In
particular, you haven't answered my criticisms, which were:

* Location is meaningless, so why bother with it.

* The diversity penalty is missing. (It should cost more to run 
  1 Farm and 1 House than to run 2 Farms or 2 Houses).

Still, I like the mechanism for handling factory "input". It's neater
than any maintenance payment system I have devised.

The fault of that lies with the Rebels.  It is in their power
to stop it.

"Imbalance?"  If you measure VT imbalance as VTs held by Threat
vs. VTs held by non-Threat, I suppose it would.  The only
VT imbalance I care about, however, is VTs held by me vs
VTs held by everyone else.

Now, consider that I recently lost an Election for Notary
(no hard feelings, I hope, Murphy?  Certainly none on this
side), even with the backing of the Threat.  Thus, it seems
to me highly unlikely that in another Rebellion, I would
win any elections except that for Rulekeepor.  In other words:
No Rebellion: I am Rulekeepor, but hold no other offices.
Rebellion: I am Rulekeepor, but hold no other offices.
In either case, the VT imbalance--as I define it--is the same.

I consider it an honor to be named Rulekeepor in perpetuity, but
I do *not* take that to mean I can suddenly ignore the will of
Agorans.  There is no shame in my having to run for re-election,
at any time--if there comes a time when I cannot win an election
for Rulekeepor, then I do not deserve to be Rulekeepor.

In other words: First, I won't be blackmailed into voting
for impeachments on the grounds that no impeachments will lead
to Rebellion.  Second, if there is a Rebellion, either
a) I win my election as Rulekeepor, in which case no harm
is done, or b) I lose my election as Rulekeepor, in which
case I do not deserve to be Rulekeepor anyway.  I feel the
same holds true for Kolja and the Ambassadorship.

>It is thus in this spirit that I ask you to vote FOR all Impeachments,

What if I said I would Rebel if Michael were not impeached?  (I
ask merely hypothetically.)  Would you find that sufficient cause
to vote FOR the impeachment of Michael?

Looks like I accidentally deleted Sherlock's original

send me a copy, including the timestamp?

I agree with this analysis. I would add that that the 2:1 majority
needed to pass an Impeachment Referendum adds significantly to the
opprobrium, because, if such a Referendum does pass, it carries
enormous authority. Thus to bring an Impeachment Referendum against
a Player is an extremely serious matter, and to vote for Impeachment
is an action that should be taken only after careful consideration,
not as a kneejerk reaction in the heat of the moment.

Indeed. Speaker-Elect Blob does not deserve to become the first Player
to be Impeached just because this would have some slightly amusing
consequences.

Heh.  :-)

Seriously, though:  Michael has a legitimate grievance because the scam
forces caused him a lot of work without warning, for which I'm sorry.  He
was further complaining because it seemed like a pure power grab with
nothing more to it.

If the original revolt had been purely for the purposes of grabbing power,
I would not have supported it myself.  Likewise if your present Impeachment
is for such purposes, I don't expect people to support it.

Naturally, if you have some secret, stylish scam to pull off because of the
impeachment, you won't tell me.  But you will need to tell someone, if you
expect cooperation.

I hate to spoil your fun, but I think the honourable course is deny
Players a reason to vote for Blob's Impeachment if it lies within my
power to do it. Therefore, I announce that if Blob is Impeached, I
shall immediately resign the Office of Speaker-Elect and appoint Blob
as my successor, avoiding the fun and games you'd like to have at the
expense of Blob's good name.

Actually, assuming 'Speaker Transition Reform' passed, which I think it
did, there no longer is a ceremonial handshake.

A great shame. In the first place, there won't be a ceremonial
handshake: P3703 got rid of them. In the second place, if Blob
is Impeached, I intend immediately to resign as Speaker-Elect,
apoointing him as my successor.

There aren't any.  Changes would have been marked with changebars.  I

This is looking less likely at the moment.  I am not keeping track of
the Impeachment votes, but I'd be surprised if any of them passed, and
there are now only four Rebellious Players.

I was going to post a record of all who have Voted so far and how they
did so, but I seem prohibited this by R1434.  If anyone else wishes
to, go for it.

Can I ask where you got the idea that I'm using the Impeachments to
keep my "clique" in Office or "grab for power"?  First, I don't even
have a "clique" (I'm too new for that); second, I wasn't planning to
run in any of the upcoming Elections.

You've charged me with this three times now, and I have to admit that
I'm befuddled.

If, on the other hand, you don't really believe this, and you're just
doing it to reverse my argument upon myself --- bravo.  :)

At the moment, none of them are passing, but the only one which cannot
possibly achieve a 2 to 1 ration is the Impeachment of Michael as
Cartographor.  The others are still too close to call.

Thank you Steve (and elJefe also).  I am more than happy to put this

Hmmm. That's true, but still, Officers get vastly more income than 
non-Officers, so eventually non-Officers will become politically 
negligible (specifically: when their bank accounts run dry). This 
ignores Quorum, however.

True. However, I maintain that under Birthrights, VTs would be more

Well spoken. I would like to know which aspects of the current

I don't believe it's a naked grab for power. I believe it's a naked 
grab for fame and fortune :-)

I seriously doubt you will, in fact, be Impeached. Also, I don't 
think being removed in a broad Impeachment of many officers is 
particularly disgraceful. The disgrace associated with impeachment 
(generally) comes from what the person impeached did, not the 
impeachment.

I wouldn't vote for impeachment based on the scam if it wasn't a 
scam which relied on Officership. The criterion for impeachment is 
generally (TTBOMK) abuse of official powers, and I think that 
scamming the ruleset is abuse of power (benign, all in good fun, and 
certainly forgivable, however). Therefore, I am voting to impeach.
I do hope you don't take it personally.

Oh, come on. It's not as if being Impeached as S-E carries any of
the opprobrium that arguably attaches to being Impeached for another
Office. The S-E performs no duties whatsoever; it's purely an Office
of convenience.

I know this sounds like a belated "me too", but I would like to add my 
apologies to Steve and elJefe's, even if my Rebellion ended up having
no effect on the outcome.

Isn't it clear that you are part of quite a strong clique which just
recently formed, ie the "get Threat out of power" clique? Who do you
intend will fill the Offices that you oust us from? Are they not members
of that clique? 

Not that I blame you for this, but your concern to keep power out of 
our hands is pretty much equivalent to our concern to hold on to it,
isn't it?

You may claim to be working to spread the Offices around a bit, to have
no strong concentration of power, but if that is the case, why are you
trying to Impeach us for all the Offices we hold? Why not just select
about half of them, and let us keep the rest? 

I don't accuse you of wrongdoing, you are just playing the game. And
part of that is playing to win. I am also playing to win, as recent
events have shown. I just don't buy your innocent arguments that you
are doing this for the good of the game.

Of course, by all means resist our hold on power. It wouldn't be 
much fun if you didn't. And, if it helps your cause, appeal to other
players for the good of the game in order to help you do so, but 
don't expect us to sit idly by and let you do so. Agora is a game of
propaganda as much as any other form of politics. It may not be the
Public Forum, but I strongly believe that this game is won or lost in
agora-discussion.
