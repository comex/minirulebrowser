That's a quite separate problem. To solve it, the Chancellor could
equally raise the BOS so that the amount actually paid after taxes are
levied is about 4 VTs for each BOS unit owed to an Officer. Of course,
he'd have to consult with the Accountor about what level of tax the
Accountor intended to levy.

But none of that would solve the problem I'm talking about - that we
cannot vote on credit with VTs we don't have, because Voting Debts are
assessed weekly. It's of no use to me that I will be able to pay in
April for votes I cast now - in the meantime I'll be denied Voting
Privileges and incur Blot penalties for failing to satisfy Payment
Orders.

They could not buy their groceries weekly if the debt collectors were
sent after them if they didn't pay after a week. They'd have to pay
cash, or go without. That's the situation we're in now.

It's not a bug, it's a feature. Though I'm happy to concede that we
could try a different collection of features.

Of course. What's wrong with that? If you spend beyond your means, knowing
that you won't be able to pay back until the beginning of the next month, 
then surely that is your problem. 

If you want extended credit, beyond the week offered by the Bank, then 
maybe you can arrange a deal with another player. I don't see any reason
why the Bank should support you in such a situation.

Then you should have saved some of your VTs from last time you were
paid. (Which, I note, you have.)

I don't understand your complaint. You seem to be saying "I can't spend
VTs I haven't been given yet." Of course not.

It's not really credit I'm after, but wage justice. You might have a
point if Salaries were paid monthly *in advance*; then I suppose it
would be fair to regard it as my problem if I cannot budget for the
month. But they're not. I have to wait until April to get paid for work
I'm doing right now.

It's a feature that a substantial portion of Officer salaries is
immediately taxed away?  Why bother paying the salary at all?

My complaint is that I've done the work for which I'm being paid, and I
need my wages in order to buy the necessities of life, but my boss is
telling me that I have to wait a considerable length of time before I
get paid, and that it's my problem if I starve in the meantime. This is
not what I call an incentive to work.

All of your arguments could be applied equally well if we decided to pay
Salaries just once a year. Would you still be telling me that I should
have saved my pay from last year? What if this were my first year in
work?

I insist: if debts are assessed weekly, then Salaries must be paid
weekly.

So?  I can't think of anyone who gets paid in advance, except maybe
Hollywood actors.

No, that's not a feature - that's a bug caused by paying Salaries
monthly instead of weekly. I designed the tax system in a different
environment where Salaries were paid weekly, so that inputs and outputs
were much smoother. Now we get a massive input spike at the beginning of
eery month, and then nothing for the next four weeks. The VTCL test for
levying taxes was not designed to work in such an environment, and it's
now broken. (Or as I prefer to view it, it's the payment of Salaries
which is broken).

Were Salaries being paid weekly as they should be, we could could have
comfortably sustained a low VTCL of 5, without taxes ever having to be
levied, and with only the intended effect (the feature I was referring
to), that Officers would be strongly encouraged to spend their VTs.

Public servants in Australia are paid fornightly, half in advance. But
that's not really the point. The point is that in in the real world,
debts are not assessed weekly. Even credit cards give you a month to
pay. If debts were assessed weekly, and heavy penalties incurred by
those without the cash to meet their debts then and there, believe me
everyone would be screaming to get paid weekly.

What's stopping us from paying Officers (some portion of) their salary
in advance? Would that upset anyone? Is it too scammable?

Still unfair on new Officers. I don't understand your objection to
paying Salaries weekly. It was a sensible, well understood system that
served us very well for years. Paying Salaries monthly has introduced a
raft of complications and difficulties for no tangible benefit I can
see.

What you mentioned in your Judgement was precisely the opposite of this
statement. I quote:

     The Rules do not mandate that a message purporting to contain a
     Vote should unambiguously express the voting Player's intent; all
     that they require is that such a message clearly identify an
     existing Proposal...

But they do not require any such thing.

I'm just interested to explore the complications, rather than "fix" them.

IMO, what's really broken is your entire system model, if it is so
sensitive to changes that such a minor change as the timing of salary
payments can completely destroy its ability to maintain equilibrium.
Surely a more robust system can be constructed!

Weekly and even daily debts are not uncommon, actually.  (Normally,
though, such debts are small.)

Yeah, I'm really quaking in my boots at the thought; I toss and turn at
night, finally falling into an uneasy sleep, in which I dream that the
Monopoly Problem, in horribly demonic guise, is stalking me
relentlessly. I wake screaming in a cold sweat.

Get a grip, Scott. I have "squelched" nothing. My attempts to avoid the
Monopoly Problem have basically been two. First case: the Restore Game
Balance proposals, which relieved elJefe, Crito and myself of about 2000
VTs each - a classic case of "massive and persistent" inequity. You
opposed them. Why? 

Second case: taxes. Here you have more scope for argument. But what will
you criticize me for? I identified a problem, and proposed a solution,
which the rest of the community voted to accept. I never claimed the
taxation system was perfect, and I have no doubt it can improved upon,
perhaps even upon the lines you have suggested. But at least it was a
start, and nobody else was suggesting anything better at the time. And
we can certainly say that without the taxation system, we would still be
wondering what it would really be like to have VT scarcity. Instead,
we've at least had a couple of months experience with it (we'd have had
more but for our problems getting an Accountor's Report for the last 3
months of last year), which I regard as invaluable. What we do with that
experience is up to us.

Precisely. Not the kinds of things to get the debt collectors showing up

You also have a history of opposing measures which have been calculated
to make the economy meaning*ful*. Viz, your opposition to my Proposals
to Restore Game Balance, on the grounds that anything which
redistributes wealth from rich Players to poor Players is
anticompetitive and unfair. Oh really.

I opposed the "Restore Game Balance" [sic] Proposals because they were 
overly aggressive in wealth redistribution.  I'm not opposed to wealth 
redistribution, but it should be reasonable and limited to the minimum 
necessary.  Specifically, there was no reason why _I_ should have lost 
VTs, just because Crito and a couple others had ridiculously large
amounts.

Keep also in mind that having a lot of VTs doesn't necessarily make
one rich; you may still need P-Notes and Indulgences as well.

I think we should set aside, for the moment, the current notions of
respresenting entitlements by tradable Currencies and looking more
closely at what entitlements the Rules create and what we want the
characteristics of those entitlements to be.  I think a lot of
possibilities have been overlooked, primarily out of functional
fixedness, an unholy marriage to a cumbersome and possibly unnecessary
Currency system, and a general lack of creative thinking.

My take on that "experience" is that it stifles the game badly.

A good proto, and a definite improvement on the current system. I'll
support this.

Protoproposal Chaos70 [rev. 3]

More Sensible Amendment Numbers

Be it resolved, that Rule 1069 be amended to read:

      (a) Each Rule shall have an Amendment Number.
        (1) The Amendment Number of a new Rule, when that Rule is
            created, is zero.
        (2) The Amendment Number of each Rule existing at the time
            this version of this Rule takes effect is whatever its
            Amendment Number was under the prior version of this Rule;
            if a Rule had no Amendment Number on that version of this
            Rule, its Amendment Number is zero.
        (3) The Amendment Number of a Rule is incremented by one
            whenever a Rule Change affecting that Rule takes place.

      (b) A Rule's Amendment Number shall be displayed in Official
          copies of the Ruleset, appended to the Rule Number, and
          separated by a forward slash.  Responsibility is given to
          the Rulekeepor to accurately update Amendment Numbers.

      (c) Amendment Numbers may be used for Official purposes and in
          Official documents to distinguish between old versions of a
          Rule and the Rule's current text.

The fact was that at the time, we all had way too many VTs. There were
about 8500 in circulation; elJefe, Crito and myself shared about 6000 of
those between us, Chuck had another 200, and the others were distributed
among the rest. So, there were indeed good reasons why you, and everyone
else, should have lost VTs as a result of RGB.

I confess that your idea of a system of tradeable rights has its
attractions. Doubtless it will also have its pitfalls. I'm certainly not
opposed to looking at the issue.

Does this do anything other than reformat R1069 and translate its
provisions into that idiolect of legalese you seem to find aesthetically
pleasing?

I certainly do not insist on an equal distribution of resources. (Stop
trying to make me over into a straw man; it only makes you sound
ridiculous.) Wealth is not equally distributed now, if you care to
notice. And you seem to have missed the fact that the levying of taxes
leaves relative wealth distributed more or less as before. If wealth is
unequally distributed before taxes are levied, it will still be
unequally distributed after taxes are paid. The point of taxes is not to
redistribute wealth (taxes are paid to the Bank, after all, not given to
the poor), but to maintain some reasonable level of scarcity.

I think the key idea in Scott's proposal is that the rights expire.  I
am keen about this because it gives the game a "use it or lose it"
aspect without arbitrarily taking people to stop wealth accumulation. 

Here is a proto that I'd like to submit soon, that takes this idea and
plays around with it.  It applies the idea of an expiring currency to
P-Notes, and makes the primary input of P-Notes be a random, monthly
distribution.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Create a rule with the title "Expiring Currencies" and the following
text (up to the line of ten hyphens):

The rules may specify that certain currencies are "expiring".  Each
unit of such a currency (i.e., an amount of that currency equal to its
MUQ) is functionally indistinguishable from all others, except that
any given unit may have an expiry date associated with it.  This
expiry date may only be changed by methods explicitly allowed in the
rules.  Further an expiry date is always the last day of a month, so
allowing terminology which associates units with particular months
(the month at the end of which they will expire).

A unit of an expiring currency that does not have an expiry date is
known as Immortal.  Units of an expiring currency with the same
expiries (whether a given month, or Immortal) are indistinguishable.
Units of an Expiring Currency of any expiry date may be minted without
restriction by the Chancellor.

At the end of each month, all units of an expiring currency with an
expiry date of that month become useless, and the Recordkeepor for the
Currency in question need no longer record them as being in any
Entity's possession.  They have effectively disappeared.

The Recordkeepor for an Expiring Currency must keep track of how many
units all Entities own, subdivided by unit expiry times.

Payment Orders required by the rules for an expiring currency may not
specify that a unit of a particular expiry be paid.  However, when a
transfer is made, the transferring Entity may specify which units are
transferred.

----------

Create a rule with the title "Extending an Expiring Unit's Lifetime"
and the following text (up to the line of ten hyphens):

An Entity in control of a unit of an Expiring Currency with an expiry
date may extend that date by a month by transferring either an
Indulgence or another unit of the same Currency with the same expiry
date to the Bank, simultaneously notifying the Currency Recordkeepor
that e is doing so, and as long as the transfer is not satisfying any
Payment Order.

----------

Amend the rule "Proposal Notes" (R1701/5) by replacing the sentence
"Proposal Notes (P-Notes) are a Currency." with the sentence "Proposal
Notes (P-Notes) are an Expiring Currency."

----------

Amend "Currency Awards for New Players" (R1677/5) by replacing the
current text with "As soon as possible after the start of a Player's
Grace Period, the Registrar shall pay out to that Player 5 Voting
Tokens, and 1 P-Note with an expiry date of the second month after the
month of the Player's registration."

----------

Create a rule with the title "New P-Notes randomly distributed" and
the following text (up to the line of ten hyphens):

As soon as possible after the beginning of the month, the Promotor
shall pay out a number of P-Notes to the Players at large.  The number
to be paid out shall be the number of proposals distributed in the
previous month.  The expiry date on each P-Note so distributed will be
the month following the month just begun.

The recipients of the P-Notes to be distributed will be determined
randomly as follows:
  1) Every unemployed Player will have one chance
  2) Every Officer will have a number of chances equal to the sum of
     the Basic Officer Salary numbers for the Offices that they hold
     divided by 0.5.
  3) Then, for each P-Note to be distributed, the Promotor will
     randomly pick a Player such that their chance of being the
     recipient is equivalent to the chance of their name being pulled
     from a hat with all the Players' names in it, where there are as
     many copies of a Player's name as that Players has the chances
     defined in clauses 1) and 2) above.
  4) Further, when a Player is determined to be the recipient of one
     of the P-Notes, one copy of their name is removed from the
     conceptual hat specified above for all subsequent determinations
     of recipients.  Thus, an Officer filling just one post with a BOS
     of 1.0, can receive at most 2 P-Notes from this distribution.

Having determined the number and recipients of the new P-Notes, the
Promotor shall then order the Bank to pay out these P-Notes to the
specified recipients.

----------

Amend "Reward for getting a proposal passed" (R833/12) by replacing
the phrase "two Proposal Notes" with "one Proposal Note with an expiry
date of the sixth month after the end of this month".

----------

Amend "Bonus for Repeal" (R947/12) by replacing the phrase "1 P-Note"
with "1 VT".

----------

Amend "The Right of Patronage" (R1661/5) by inserting the following
two sentences after the sentence which ends "one Currency Minted by
the Bank": "If the Speaker specifies a unit of an Expiring Currency
then, this unit will usually have an expiry date of the month after
the current month.  However, once a month, the Speaker may specify an
Immortal unit of an Expiring Currency."

Blech.  Taking a perfectly good cup of tea, and then contaminating
with this awful additive.  There should be a law against it :-)

I propose:

Crate a rule with title "The Agoran Anti-drink" with the following
text: 

Agora shall officially regard Earl Grey tea as a noxious beverage.

Oh dear, a 2-2 split for my Agoran Anti-drink proposal.

But wait, Andre's not a Player; maybe it still has a chance :-)

It tastes much the same no matter where I drink the stuff. (which I do 
like).  The Germans have the best that I've tried though.

Can I ask why are we taxed??

If it is just to regulate the amounts of cash moving about then there 
must be a better system...

Yes, it does.  It increments the Amendment Number everytime a Rule is
changed, not merely amended.  It has at least one other effect, but I
forget what it is.  (I think something to do with closing a small gap
in the Rule's coverage.)

It seems somehow appropriate given the context, but nevertheless I am
somewhat unsure that you really want the Rule to be _crated_...

Well, I like Earl Grey too, although I will admit that at least
for me, it was an acquired taste.  

Someday I'm going to host an Agoran dinner party:

Earl Grey tea
Nile Spice Black Bean Soup
filet of Walrus...

Protoproposal Chaos75 [rev. 6]

Plainness is a Virtue

Be it resolved, that Rule 1023 be amended to read:

      (a) Any Player who fails to perform, in a timely manner, an
          action required of em by the Rules is guilty of Tardiness, a
          Class D Crime.

      (b) The definition of "a timely manner" shall be at the sound
          discretion of the Judge assigned to judge a CFJ alleging
          this crime, but shall in no case include:
        (1) intentional failures to perform; nor
        (2) intentional and excessive delays in performance.

      (c) Generally, performance within one week's time will be timely
          unless the Rules suggest otherwise.  The performance of
          actions in an order other than that in which the duties to
          perform them were incurred may be used as evidence of
          untimely performance, but is not proof thereof.

      (d) This Rule in no way modifies any requirement imposed by
          other Rules to perform specific acts within a specific time
          or in a specific order.

Here's an idea: raise money by sponsoring products. I'm sure we'd get
a lot of takers who'd want their brand name enshrined in the Ruleset.

Protoproposal Chaos44 [rev. 10]

Oh, what a tangled web....

Be it resolved, that Rule 478 be amended to read:

      (a) A Public Forum is any medium of communication so designated
          as such by the Registrar.

      (b) The Registrar may designate any medium as a Public Forum, or
          revoke such designation from a medium already so designated,
          Without Objection.  However, the message which is to
          effectuate the change intended must be sent via a medium
          which is a Public Forum both before and after the
          designation or revocation, in order to have legal effect.

      (c) The Registrar may designate any medium (other than one which
          is designated as a Public Forum) as a Discussion Forum,
          Without Objection, and may revoke such designation in the
          same manner.  The designation of a medium as a Public Forum
          automatically revokes any designation of that same medium as
          a Discussion Forum.

      (d) Every Active Player shall ensure that e is able to receive
          messages sent to every medium which the Registrar has
          designated as a Public Forum.  However, the temporary
          inability of a Player to receive a Public Forum does not
          deprive that medium of its status as a Public Forum.

      (e) Any message conveyed by one or more Public Fora is deemed to
          have been sent to the Public Forum.  In addition, any
          message sent, by any medium or combination of media, other
          than a medium designated as a Discussion Forum, to every
          Active Player so that each Active Player is reasonably
          certain to receive it, is deemed to have been sent to the
          Public Forum, but only if it bears an explicit indication
          that it is intended to be a Public Forum message.

      (f) Whenever the Rules require a Player to "announce", "post",
          or "distribute" some communication or notification, that
          Player shall do so by sending it to the Public Forum, unless
          the Rules specify otherwise in that instance.

      (g) When the Rules require that a message be sent directly to a
          Player, or make a legal effect contingent on sending a
          message to a Player, the use of a Discussion Forum to send
          such a message shall not be effective unless the receiving
          Player explicitly or implicitly confirms having received
          that message.

Sorry, I meant, why do you want to require the date to be
posted on the Ruleset?  What will it achieve that is not
already covered by the "Date:" email header?

Shouldn't there be a list of the public forums set into a Officers 
report within the context of this rule?

Your Proposal may not work as intended if passed, as Proposals cannot give
Orders to Players.  You would have to wait at least until Scott's Proposal
"Proposals may Order" has passed (it has not been distributed yet, but is 
in the Queue.)

Greetings,
rjan.

and I'm sorry for being rude, I knew what you ment...

I cannot download the rules from my hotmail account, (I don't know why 
but it never works) and so I download them from your website.  Also it 
would help me to be sure which version of the ruleset I was looking at.  
It would also be nice to know what the last proposal was which affected 
the ruleset, if that could be attched to the file.

Your Proposal may not work as intended if passed, as Proposals cannot 
give
Orders to Players. 

Why??

Is there a rule which says that they can not?

If  so tell me.  If not, why doesn't rule 594 apply?

Rule 594/3 (Power=1)
Proposals and Rule Changes

      When a Proposal is adopted, its Power becomes equal to its
      Adoption Index, and the provisions contained in the text of the
      Proposal are implemented to the maximal extent permitted by the
      Rules.  Provisions which are unclear, ambiguous, or inapplicable
      are ignored.  In a Proposal containing more than one provision,
      each provision is severable from the others, unless the Proposal
      states otherwise.

"implemented to the maximal extent permitted by the Rules" would suggest 
that they would be allowed, or am I wrong.... Explain this to me...... 
sllllooooooowwwwwlllyyy...(but not that slowly)

Rule 101.  Players have no obligation to abide by adopted Proposals.
At least, this is how we have always interpreted Rule 594.

I'll see if I can't include a statement to that effect on the
various Rule-related web pages.  It's not a major change, so I
wouldn't think it would take too long, but no guarantees on when
I'll get that done.  (Hopefully by this weekend, but no promises.)

I don't think your proposal would necessarily achieve what you
wanted it to, though--at present (and under your proposal) the
web-based Rules are entirely unregulated.  Only emailed Rulesets
are regulated by the Rules.

The website is an unofficial service, and has no legal standing; Chuck 
is not obliged to put the Rules on the web at all.

If you cannot receive the Rules via email, then I might suggest that
you are in violation of Rule 478, in that you have failed to ensure
that you can actually receive each message sent to every Public Forum.

In response to Peekee,

Rule 1793/0 (Power=1)
Orders

      An Order is a command, executed by a Player and directed to some
      entity requiring that entity to perform exactly one action, or
      to refrain from performing one or more actions.

Your proposal would issue an order, but it would not be an Order, as defined by the Rules and therefore no Player would have any obligation to abide by that order.  (IMO, the proposal is fully implemented by the issuance of the order, whether it is obeyed or not.)

Additionally,

Rule 1797/0 (Power=1)
Abuse of Authority

      Knowingly and willfully executing invalid Orders constitutes the
      Class B Crime of Abuse of Authority.

So, if a Player would attempt to follow the proposal's orders by issuing POs,
e would arguably be guilty of Abuse of Authority, since the Rules did not
grant them the authority to do so.  It's the same as if I were to order the Registrar to pay out 100 VTs to me.  I can issue that order, but it would have no legal significance and if e were to follow it, e would be guilty of Abuse.

--Crito

>>> "Alan Riddell" <pkpeekee@hotmail.com> 03/09/99 03:06PM >>>
Your Proposal may not work as intended if passed, as Proposals cannot 
give
Orders to Players. 

Why??

Is there a rule which says that they can not?

If  so tell me.  If not, why doesn't rule 594 apply?

Rule 594/3 (Power=1)
Proposals and Rule Changes

      When a Proposal is adopted, its Power becomes equal to its
      Adoption Index, and the provisions contained in the text of the
      Proposal are implemented to the maximal extent permitted by the
      Rules.  Provisions which are unclear, ambiguous, or inapplicable
      are ignored.  In a Proposal containing more than one provision,
      each provision is severable from the others, unless the Proposal
      states otherwise.

"implemented to the maximal extent permitted by the Rules" would suggest 
that they would be allowed, or am I wrong.... Explain this to me......

I must be very slow today.  Isn't "the greatest integer not greater..." always
equal to the number of votes in existance, since that's the largest number
that satisfies your condition (there would be no unassessed votes , so
none would have a bid equal to one that was assessed).  Did you mean
to say the smallest integer?

You're right. I meant to say Votes Available.

As with the General's Summary Adoption, such a Rule would require
Power=3 to be effective.  And I'd oppose it anyway.
