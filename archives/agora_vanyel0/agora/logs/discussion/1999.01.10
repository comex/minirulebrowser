Not to mention that it would completely destroy the basis of our
chronology: that noon is the time the sun crosses thes meridian. One
might as well just shift all times back by one hour.

Actually does that about 1:10 p.m. here.  Would be 2:10 p.m. if we
observed Daylight Stupidity Time.

The Soviet Union did that.

I think that only happens at the Equator. In any case, that would be an
argument for not having DST at all, even in summer, not just for not
having it in winter.

The problem with shifting times back an hour in winter would be that it
would get dark very early, around 4:30 in the afternoon. My remark about
wanting more daylight in the morning in the winter should be qualified,
"subject to availability". In fact, in winter one would like more
daylight in the morning *and* in the evening - but it's simply not
available, so one makes do as one can. In summer daylight is freely
available to be moved around as is convenient.
