Hm, more vehement objections to the Return of Points. What's *your*

Of course, this interprets the electorate's intentions in a certain

Yes, it is a common problem with email these days.  The original SMTP
standard was specified to transport 7-bit text only.  Although later
additions to the standard allow the transfer of 8-bit binary data,
not all systems support this.  An MTA wishing to send a non-7-bit
message to an SMTP server not supporting 8-bit data is faced with the
unenviable choice of (a) bouncing the message, (b) sending 8-bit data
in contravention of the standard, or (c) mangling the message contents
(using MIME) to make it 7-bit text.  All of these alternatives are bad.

I'm reasonably keen to see the reintroduction of Points, so I would be
willing to vote more than twice on it.  However, I feel impoverished
VT-wise, so won't do so unless someone transfers me the necessary VTs
inside the next four hours or so.

Of course, minting of Coins would be under the control of the central
authority (IN).  They would also have to be universally
transferrable.  If certain nomics used them for different purposes
that would be up to the Nomics in question.  However, the point of
making it a universal currency would be that Players from different
games could then trade with each other.

Go ahead.  Kolja A. can probably provide any necessary IN details.

There is a lot of woolly language in the Proposal that I am extremely
uncomfortable with (see my recent Wizard's Report).  This Proposal, if
adopted, will tie up the Courts for several weeks, creating along the
way a bunch of busywork for several Officers (including myself)
reporting what will probably turn out to be meaningless Point Changes
because of some flaw in the Proposal.

This Proposal needs to be fixed and reproposed, not adopted in its
present poorly-crafted form.  First step: don't "associate".

unless someone else is already doing so.
<<

Yes, go for it! Here are some random thoughts that might help to make
this work.

- IN is in a very basic stage, so keep it simple. Try not to expect a
lot of structure (IN has no offices, no obligations for anyone to be
subscribed to the mailing list, no currencies/objects/whatsoever...).

- Creation and recordkeeping must somehow happen at the IN
level. Ideally all interactions between IN and the member nomics
should be conducted via the liaisons; e.g. the coins are transferred
to a member nomic by assigning them to the liaison; after that IN
doesn't care what the liaison does with them. IN only tracks which
nomic has which amount of coins, not what happens to these coins
within the member nomics. Of course, coin trades between nomics must
be recorded on the IN level, and be conducted/reported by the
liaisons.

- The coins should have some purpose in IN - e.g. pay for voting
(probably a bad idea, as hardly anyone is voting anyway), or even for
staying a member in the first place (give each nomic three coins;
nomics with zero coins lose the right to vote or something).

This is probably the hardest bit: find a function of these coins that
will make them a commodity people actually want to have (in Agora's
"economy" giving the currencies a real value - and an appropriate
scarceness - is the major problem).

- Try not to favor Agora in any way (e.g. by automatically making it
the first recordkeepor of coins).

Now that plots failed it looks as if we'll be without a constant
source of VTs for some time. This is good, because it will keep VTs
scarce, and it will make holding office more attractive (anyone for
scorekeepor?) - but it is not very fair on players without any office
to limit their VT income to the few VT rewards that we have.

What about a kind of social security rule that at least provides some
minimal VT income for players without a regular salary? (Of course we
could just reinstate a VT stipend for everyone, but that would create
inflation again...) Of course, it must be less than the basic officer
salary, otherwise people with low salary offices (like me) don't have
any material reward for holding office anymore.

What about this:

Create a new rule titled "VT unemployment benefits"

 At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Registrar shall pay out to
 every player who does not receive any Officer's Salary for the
 previous week an unemployment benefit of half a Basic Officer Salary. 


What do you think? (and is the capitalization correct, Scott?)

My objection is more fundamental--needless multiplication of
entities.  We have a lot to work with already.  P-Notes
are likely to become a viable currency with the adoption
of the Proposal Queue.  VTs have just become rather scarce.
No doubt a fixed Plots Proposal will be made in the not-too-distant
future.  I think that's enough to play around with for awhile,
and I don't want to throw points into the mix as well.

  If any of you are interested, I had been planning a major scam since
last week concerning the Return of Points and just decided last night
not to go through it.  My idea was to wait until the Voting Period was
almost ended, then issue on the Business List a declaration that I was
minting a new currency named Points.  When the Proposal passed I could
then start minting Points, which would naturally entail an increase in
Score.  (Evwen more deviously, I would be the only one able to make
Points).  I decided against this purely because it was such a closely
contested vote; it seemed like a pretty low down thing to do.

  Oh well, it was a good idea at the time. ;)

Soem of you may have more basic things to criticize about the points
proposal, but here are some minor things I would like to modify.

Proto 1: Cosmetics
==================

Amend the rule titled "Changing a Player's Score" by replacing "eim"
with "em".

Amend the rule titled "Initiating an Endgame Procedure" by replacing
the paragraph

     An unchallenged Endgame Procedure shall be terminated one week from 
     the date of its initiation, unless the Rules require an earlier 
     termination.

with

     An unchallenged Endgame Procedure shall be terminated as soon as
     it has been unchallenged for seven consecutive days, unless the 
     Rules require an earlier termination.


Proto 2: Points for IN participation
====================================

Amend the rule titled "The Omnibus Scoring Rule" by appending the
paragraph 

     In any week where a Player Voted in at least one referendum on
     an Internomic proposal, e gains one Point. The Ambassador must 
     order this Score change.


Proto 3: Buying points
======================

Create a new rule with the Title "Buying points" and the text:

     Player may buy points for currencies. To do this, a player must 
     transfer the price for these points to the bank. This transfer
     may not have any other purpose. The price for any one point may
     only be paid using one single currency. As soon as possible after
     the transfer of the price, the Recordkeepor of the currency with
     which the price was paid must order the corresponding Points
     gain for the player who paid the price. 
   
     The price for one Point can be one of the following: one
     indulgence, three P-notes or three VTs.

Yes, it was a good idea and if Swann hadn't been careful to make sure Score
Points were a property of Players rather than an Entity themselves, it might
even have worked.  8)

BTW, IMO, these kinds of scams are perfectly legitimate even in a closely
contested race, so I'd say, in the future, go for it.  Of course others may
have a different opinion, so you might risk losing a few Kudos.  8)

I discovered a couple of trivial things myself, which I have incorporated

It seems to me that this is not actually defining 'terminal' in the way
that was intended by the probate Rules, because it fails to include
Players, who are persons, not Nomic Entities and so don't become destroyed

I believe that the correct definition of terminal for our purposes is
rather 'in Probate without an Executor'.

I think Plots will succeed if fixed, and encourage its author(s) to

I should note that as Assessor I number all Payment Orders I issue
with a unique Assessor's Number, and I would hope that all
Recordkeepors will consider the use of such numbers as adequate
identification of the Order in question.  I would encourage other
Officers, or at least those whose duties call for the frequent
issuance of Payment Orders, to establish some similar method of
uniquely identifying the Orders they issue in the course of their

Rule 1478/2 (Power=1)
Executors

      The Executor of an entity is a Player who is empowered by the
      Rules to act on behalf of that entity, as if e was that entity.

      Except when the Rules stipulate otherwise, a Player is eir own
      Executor.  Any other entity has an Executor only when the Rules
      specify either a Player or a means to designate a Player to be
                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      the Executor of that entity.
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is interesting wording here.  There is always a means to designate a
Player to be the Executor of any person, i.e. that person may register and
become eir own Executor.  This rule says an entity has an Executor if there is
a means to designate one, but does *not* say that the means must have been
carried out.  IMO, this means any person, even a de-registered Player, always
has an Executor, although the Rules are silent on who or what exactly *is* the
Executor of a non-registered person (the natural assumption would be the person
emself).  If I'm right here, your fix would not work either.  You would also
have to fix this wording so an entity does not actually have an Executor until
the means to designate one has been completed, e.g. "... when the Rules specify
a Player or when a Player has been designated to be the Executor of that entity
by a means specified in other Rules."

Scott makes a good point here.  I, of course, would honor any such unique
identification of a Payment Order for Currencies for which I am responsible.

Debatable.  The proposal defines a Score increase as a gain in Points,
so arguably minting new Points is a change in Score.  Anyways, as I
said, it only would have worked if Points existed as a currency of
mine before the proposal passed, thus opening an opportunity to argue
that the Proposal was simply one to modify my currency.  A long shot,
but it could have worked.

'Only when' is math speak, and as such does not imply that an Entity which
satisfies the condition _has_ an Executor, but merely that an Entity which
does _not_ satisfy the condition does not.

I hope that is enough to satisfy you, because otherwise we have a Crisis
here... several Probate-related actions already taken may have been
illegal.

Greetings,

Similar scams ahve been tried before.  I think the ruling has been
that two entities are not necessarily the same just because
they have the same name.  Also, I think it would have been decided
that the "Points" in the Rules all refer to Rule-defined points,
and not your currency of points.

Does someone want to pull up or summarize the Hot Potato scam,
which tried something similar and failed?  (I mean the name-based
Hot Potato scam, not Steve and Kelly's successful Hot Potato scam.)
I don't remember the details.

This would be my creation of a Contest named "Nomic Potato", shortly
before the Rules were changed to define an entity known as the "Nomic
Potato".  I argued that both entities had the same name, and therefore,
by R1586, must be the same entity.  It was ruled that the Rules defining
an entity "known as" the Nomic Potato did not actually make that its name,
so the Contest and the Potato were in fact entirely distinct.

I don't understand.

  Rule 1586/1 (Power=1)
  Definition and Continuity of Entities

      A "Nomic Entity" is any entity which has no discernible
      existence without the Rules, only existing by virtue of the
      Rules defining it to exist.  No two Nomic Entities (including
      Players) shall have the same name or nickname.

Wouldn't that imply that all uses of the same name are of one Entity?
Or am I misreading something?

Looking in Webster's dictionary, I note that "nominate" in all
of its meanings seems to be take a direct object, hence "I nominate"
is not a complete thought.  (If you meant that you nominate yourself,
I don't see any meanings that are reflexive.)

I don't mean to be an absolute nit-picker; I was just trying to point
out that you failed to mention whom you nominate.

Wouldn't that imply that all uses of the same name are of one Entity?
Or am I misreading something?
<<

It might also mean that the attempt to create the second entity, with
the same name as an older, existing one, failed because of this naming
problem. Or that it succeeded, created a different entity, but the
attempt to name it like an existing one failed, or at least violated a
rule. 

In fact, Morendil tried just the kind of scam you have in mind when the
current system of transferring currency was introduced: Just before
the relevant proposal was adopted, he created currencies called
"Orders", "Transfer Orders" and "Payment Orders". This created lots of
fun, court proceedings, Kudo transfers away from Morendil etc. pp.

Eventually, this scam failed because for some reason or other we
decided that the TOs etc referred to in the currency rules weren't
identical to Morendil's currencies, after all (I think - you may want
to dig out the relevant CFJs ... [picks up his CFJ-File] ... ah, here
they are, around CFJ930. I even made one of the judgements, it
seems. Should I mail these CFJs to you? To a-d for the general
entertainment of all?)

But don't forget that points as defined by the points proposal are not
nomic entities, so in the present situation it would be even harder to
argue that a currency called points is identical to the score-Points.

It satisfies me if it satisfies everyone else.  But I do wish we could avoid
these kinds of ambiguities when writing Rules.

Because you can't nominate anyone but yourself, it is an idiosyncracy of Agora
to turn "nominate" into an intransitive verb.  There are probably other such
idiosyncracies here, but I'm too used to them to think of one at the moment. 
You'll get used to them too.  8)

But according to the Agoran Ruleset, it is a complete action.
Webster's dictionary is not part of the Law of this Nomic.

I don't think the Promotor can remove a Proposal from the Queue
unless it's been there for over a month. You would however, have to
pay the extra P-note, not to protect the Proposal from being removed,
but just to get distributed.

Well, there are plenty of P-notes in circulation at the moment.
If it turns out we need more P-note inputs into the economy, we
have time to think about that.

Scams like this have been tried at least twice before: someone created
a Hot Potato Contest just before a Proposal passed which created an
Entity call the Hot Potato. More recently, Morendil minted various
kinds of Currencies called Orders just before PC was adopted. In both
cases, the Courts sensibly ruled that the scams did not work, and I'm
pretty sure that this scam would have met the same fate.

Whoops, you're right about that.  What I should have pointed out
is that the "Points" in 3686 are not *named* Points.  The
courts have ruled that "named" is to be interpreted quite narrowly--in fact,
being "called" something is not the same as being "named" that
something.

Pet peeve: "Webster's" dictionary.  You might as well just say
"dictionary."  The name "Webster" is not trademarked, and
anyone who wants to can (and does) write a dictionary and call
it Webster's.

Actually, I think you are miscounting by one, which presumably means that
the Rebellion occured and you are now the only Rebel...

Jeezum crow, I just plain suck.  A minute after I mailed out this
message Time Agent's declaration of rebellion arrived in my mailbox. 

*sigh*

Maybe next time.

I think that honour went to Time Agent, who was the 6th Player to
Rebel: Morendil, Swann, myself, General Chaos, elJefe and Time Agent.

Well, we haven't adopted 'Risky Rebellion' yet, so being one minute
late doesn't cost you anything. This provides an interesting
demonstration of what 'Risky Rebellion' would be like, though.
(Except, of course, that RR replaces the fixed threshhold for a
Revolt with a probability of Revolt).

If we gets Plots, I won't support this, although purely as a matter
of VT supply, I prefer this to Plots because it's much more frugal,
probably only putting about 6 VTs/week into circulation.

I'm glad we have this little period of real VT scarcity before 
Plots are introduced. 50 VTs were spent on Proposals 3680-3687,
about 20% of the roughly 250 VTs in circulation - and 130 of
those belong just to Oerjan and the General. So, VT scarcity
should really be starting to bite. I know I'm being much more
careful about how I cast my votes than I ever have been before.

As Distributor, this is my responsibility. Gecko is reporting problems
with Swann's address, as follows:

I get the same response when I try to send him personal mail. Is anyone
able to reach Swann and find out what's going on?

I'll cc this to the postmaster at freenet.

I was curious as to the effect of the Rebellion on
an Office held in perpetuity - Chuck as
Rulekeepor.  As far as I can tell, Chuck has been
retired from the Office since e did not delegate
it prior to the rebellion, and an election will be
required for Rulekeepor.  Also, AFAICT, if Chuck
wins that election, e will continue to hold the
Office in Perpetuity since that can only end if
the holder of the Office changes.  It seems we
have an Office being held temporarily in
perpetuity. 8)  Have I got that right?

I think you're right.  Of course, Chuck has to be elected again, but
considering that Chuck hasn't lost a Rulekeepor Election since we
started having them, I doubt we have much to worry about. :)

I said recently that I couldn't remember seeing a judgement that _I_ made 
go without appeal. There have been plenty of other judgements that go 
unappealed.

I like the idea, but how do you think we could write Internomic law to
enforce this. Obviously requiring each nomic to have a particular rule
in its Ruleset would not work very well. There's no guarantee that a rule
which "works" in one ruleset will have any effect in another. I suppose
the way to do it would be to have more general guidelines which describe
what sort of functionality is required, and then leave it up to the 
judges to decide whether a particular nomic is compliant or not.

Of course, there would have to be a set up time in which Nomics were
allowed to change whatever rules necessary to implement the requirements,
and there are going to be times of emergency when a Nomic is "broken" and
cannot fulfil the requirements for a period of time. If this happens,
the Nomic in question should be given a grace period, during which it
may recover.

Actually, rather than writing these rules specifically for a currency, or
whatever, this would for a nice general Pragmatic framework for any
requireiments posed by Internomic. It might be worth writing them up as
such, and then allowing specific requirements to be added later. 
This is beginning to sound like a Pragmatic re-write of Internomic. 
I might try my hand at it sometime, but I'd want some help. Anyone
interested?
