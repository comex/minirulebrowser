How can a Player (or Group, etc.) handle his own estate?  He's already
been deregistered (or dissolved, for a Group etc.). 

The reason the duty isn't dumped onto Recordkeepers is because
Recordkeepers are already loaded down enough as it is.

The concept is sound; there are just a few minor errors that need to
be dealt with.

Here's a strange argument, which I'm not even sure I believe myself,
but I think it should be considered:

Harlequin is Antimatter's Executor, I agree.  But if Antimatter
is not empowered to act on eir own behalf, then what can Harlequin do?
Harlequin, as Antimatter's Executor, "is empowered by the Rules to
act on behalf of [Antimatter], *as if e was [Antimatter]*.  Which
to me implies that if Harlequin is acting as Antimatter, e is
bound by all the restrictions and limitations which would apply
to Antimatter.  but if one of those restrictions is that Antimatter
cannot act on his own behalf, then Harlequin can't either!

It's a bit easier to see if we take a concrete example: you
argue that Ross-as-Antimatter (which, to me, is redundant: the
person *is* the Player; no Avatar theories here, please) cannot
vote on Proposal 5555 (for the sake of argument).  Harlequin
can act as Antimatter, but only as if e was Antimatter.  Well,
since Antimatter cannot vote on Proposal 5555, Harlequin-as-Antimatter
cannot vote on P5555 either.

Oops! Did anyone spot the swiftie I just pulled?

If we read R1478 as making anyone with power to act on behalf of another
Player that Player's Executor, even if the power is only power in specific
cases, eg the power to deregister, then we can't very well turn around
and argue that being a Player's Executor automatically entitles you to
act on behlaf of that Player in other ways, eg to vote on their behalf.
Consistency, please. 

Having noticed that, we then realize that we're already committed to
reading R1478 as giving Executors power to act generally, not just
in specific cases, because we granted Morendil that power with respect
to Elde. It follows that merely having power to act on behalf of a
Player in specific cases does not make you the Executor of that Player.
Ie, Antimatter is not eir own Executor in virtue of having the power
just to deregister himself.

Which brings us back to square one: what reason is there to think that
Antimatter can, say, cast votes on eir own behalf?

Very interesting, and well worth considering! Obviously, our reading
of R1478 has thus far been something like "...as if e were as that
entity would be if the entity were eir own Executor.", but you're
quite right that this is not - quite - what R1478 actually says. If
we accepted this new reading, then we'd have to reconsider Morendil's
actions on behalf of Elde, and indirectly on behalf of Blob. Their
registrations, for example would be in question (there's no guaranteed
right to register as there is to deregister).

The question is: is our old reading acceptable given the wording in
R1478, or are we forced to reject it?

I mistakenly took your terse demand for evidence as skepticism
concerning the existence of a justification of my position.

You may not, but I do. It's my view that Voting Tokens and other
Currencies should behave intuitively as much as possible like
whatever would be used to represent them in a face-to-face game,
given that we're not actually playing a face-to-face game. In a game
of Monopoly, banknotes cannot be possessed by other banknotes - nor
by Vladimir Shirinovsky, unless he happens to be playing. I think
these are features our Currencies should preserve.

Only a Player's Executor is empowered to act *as if* he were that
Player.  However, the Player emself needs no such empowerment; e *is*
emself, and may act as emself.

You aren't being deregistered because of anyone's disapproval, as far
as I know. As I hope you are well aware, I thoroughly approve of your
general style of play, and I hope you will continue playing in that
style.  I'd be disappointed (not with you, you understand), if this
episode resulted in your adopting a more conservative style of play.
It is unfortunate, in my opinion, but nonetheless legally undeniable
(also in my opinion), that you committed a great many Infractions of
Wrongful Denial. The responsibility for this is ultimately your own;
had you been more careful, you could have made it very clear that
only 4, or indeed only 1 Injunction was being issued.

Well, I certainly hope not. I do think that your temporary
deregistration is a harsh penalty for the particular Crimes
you have committed, but there it is. I also admire the spirit
with which you conducting yourself through this, and assuming
you continue to display it, there'll be a Kudo waiting for you
when you reregister in a month's time in recognition of that.

I think this is at best a misleading way of putting things. You
delivered no Judgement concerning appropriateness; rather, you
issued some Injunctions. The Board did not 'overturn' your notion
of appropriateness - this makes it sounds as though we overturned
a Judgement of yours, which we did not do. We merely reached a decision
concerning the appropriateness of your actions as Judge.

Commonsense and the best interests of the game come before other
standards, and in this case these were sufficient to reach a decision.

I disagree. The CFJ was called before the Payment Orders were vacated,
so Rule 451 applies:

Rule 451/4 (Power=1)
Determination of Judgement--Timing

      When a Judge is considering eir Judgement of a Statement
      contained in a CFJ, e shall make eir evaluation based on the
      truth or falsity of the Statement at the time the CFJ was
      issued.


Furthermore, the Judge also has to look at the Payment Orders in Indulgences
from Morendil to the Bank.

The Courts are still out on that, mind you. Both 663 and Double 
Jeopardy may have an impact on that issue.

Infractions, please. Not Crimes... Or just crimes, if you want to 
look at it that way.

This would be pointless. The Infractions have already been committed;
you also have to Judge the veracity of the Statement at the time it
was called, considering the Rules in effect at the time it was
called. It is entirely possible that a Judgement of TRUE will require
someone to post POs for the Infractions, either immediately, or on
Dec. 1, depending on your point of view. The Rule that would need to
be neutralized is 1509, not 1713.

Not too far off the mark. 

I'd elaborate and add that I recall cases where Justices handed down
decisions on matters only peripherally related to the issues at
hand, and that I'm only enunciating that as a principle that is, or
should be, be part of the implied rules of judicial conduct in Agora.
I just offered an example in a different post (what if the Board of
Appeals in CFJ 987 had handed down the same decision as the Board in
1045 did ?)


Also that I'm only claiming validity for this principle in Agora,
beause of the extreme simplicity and lack of elaborate protections
compared to RL law.

Lastly, that in the present instance the Board of Appeals did in a
sense reach a decision in contradiction to one reached by the
original Judge; they just failed to adequately justify their
authority to do so, which IMHO would have required a more detailed
discussion of the underpinnings of their intepretation of
'appropriate to the situation'.

> I am perplexed at the notion (which you seem to be espousing) that
> Boards of Appeals are not entitled to "write case law", as it were.

I agree that in the majority of cases they are. But this authority
derives from the context in which this is done. OK, time for a
thought experiment. Suppose the Board of Appeals had decided, in
Judging the Appeal of Zefram's Judgement of TRUE in CFJ
whatever-it-was, to overturn and dismiss the Judgement on the grounds
that Rule 1695 should be interpreted to mean that Injunctions are
'appropriate' when the Justices feel that they are.

Such a decision would have been suspect, wouldn't it ? The reason why 
it would have been suspect is that the Board did not _have_ to take a 
decision in the matter, before deciding that Zefram's Judgement 
should be dismissed.

The case at hand is different, in that the Board did have to
consider the appropriateness of the Injunctions before it. But the
Board was, however, under no obligation to overturn my own notion of
'appropriateness'; the Rules are silent on what this covers, and no
previous Game Custom existed as to this notion - except for my own
issuance of the Injunctions.

Did the Justices consider 'other standards' ? It seems plain that 
they did not. Justice Steve wrote :

   (...) it is plain that the Injunctions were inappropriate for the
   situation: they have nothing whatsoever to do with the matter that
   Morendil was asked to consider in his Judgement.

Justice elJefe wrote :

   It is clear that the Injunctions were all inappropriate for the
   situation of the CFJ.  "Appropriate for the situation," in the clear
   sense of the Rule, would mean that the injunction was a natural and
   expected result of the Statement being found TRUE.  In this case
   there is simply no reasonable way to connect the Statement (that CFJs
   945-970 and 972-1044 must be dismissed under Rule 1563) to the
   Injunctions (that various Officers distribute currencies to the
   masses).

Both handed down a particular decision as to what constitutes
'appropriateness', not in the form of a contradictory argumentation
buttressed by appeals to such authorities as the Rules or Game
Custom. One could argue their statements follow from common sense,
but this is clearly stretching things too far; without prompting, 
Steve was readily able to come up with an alternative reading of 
'appropriate' that does not necessarily involve the narrow context of 
the CFJ. (Actually, I think the proper focus of debate in this 
instance is the phrase 'the situation' rather than 'appropriate'.)

Actually, I am saying the converse - that this power shouldn't be,
and possibly isn't, granted to Justices whose *initial* opinions may 
not be overturned.

I am aware of that - I read up on S.C. decisions a while ago, it 
makes for very entertaining reading. :)

Oh sure. Quite a few of us have been down this road before, in fact,
some more than once. But you'll have to agree that of all the
penalties that were ever in force in this game, enforced
deregistration, though only temporary, is by far the most severe,
blurring as it does the line between 'play' penalties - transferring
Kudos or Currencies or taking away Offices and more 'concrete'
penalties - in this instance actually keeping a person away from a
favorite game. 

Sure, I know 'keeping away' is too strong a word; I was never
'there' in any sense, and there's arguably a sliver of a difference
between being deregistered and being registered. But then, we all
have a keen appreciation of this difference.

To pursue your analogy, Lawlessness is a sharp instrument - I do not
think it should be wielded lightly. More people might get cut than
we'd care.

Re: Zombies and their Executors

A careful browse of the Rules wrt Executors has led me to this conclusion. 
Indeed, when someone has been legally designated an EiP of some Player, that
Player ceases to be eir own Executor.  I agree with Steve's reasoning on this. 
The "Except when Rules stipulate otherwise" has the effect of depriving the
Player of eir own Executorship.  No conflicts arise because of this that I can
see.  However, the only result of this is that the Player then ceases to be
able to cast votes, issue Transfer Orders, or move to a new location in the
Agoraverse.  These are the only things I can find in the Rules which explicitly
state that they must be done by the Executor of an entity.

Clearly, it has been established that the person *is* the Player, and that
*anything* that person does, e is doing as a Player.  So if the Rules say that
a Player may do something (e.g. transfer a Kudo, notify Registrar of address
changes), then either the Player emself, or eir Executor may do this with legal
and binding effect.  Interestingly, either the Player or eir EiP can make a
Proposal, since R1605 only states that a Proposing Entity must have an
Executor, it does not explicitly require the Executor to make the Proposal.

I concur with this conclusion.  There are indeed certain powers that
vest in the Executor of an entity; powers not thus vested are not
necessarily deprived of that person by the virtue of not being eir own
Executor.  

I had been meaning to write on this issue, but Crito beat me to it. :)

The interaction of 1509's Precedence clause, Rules 1503 and 1504, and that
wretched CFJ 939 Annotation on Rule 1504 confuses me.

There is a sore lack of time limits in that piece of legislation. Although
that does also mean I don't have to report the penalties in any timely
manner whatsoever.

Greetings,
rjan.

Chuck mentioned creditors: I don't see how accomodating them is worth
the trouble. Let the lender beware.

While I disagree on the question of its usefulness, I should note that
the Probate concept was introduced to preserve the pre-existing notion
of Wills (for Players) and dissolution provisions (for Groups), while
at the same time eliminating the need for retrospective reporting of
transfers consequent to that (because retrospective reporting is a
major source of game state uncertainty).

As I suggested, I don't think Wills are very useful either. But I'm 
interested, how does Probate (necessarily) reduce retrospective reporting.
If one makes the posession of Currencies contingent on a Group's
existence, then the retrospective reporting of a Group's dissolution
(which can't be avoided) is equivalent to the the report of the
destruction of any Currencies it possesses. If something doesn't exist,
it doesn't have to be retrospectively reported.

Before I make a decision about this, I want to clear up something
that troubles me about this Appeal. I agree with the Appellants
that Judge Chuck did not legally give reasons for dismissal as
required by R1565. But R1565 seems pretty clear that unless a
dismissal, with legal reasons, is submitted within the period
allotted, it simply isn't a legal dismissal at all. I'm therefore
inclined to wonder why the Appellants and the CotC did not conclude
simply that Chuck defaulted by failing to submit a Judgement,
as if he had, say, returned a Judgement saying "By the powers
vested in me as Judge of CFJ 1014, I hereby Judge that the 
Statement is GLORK." I'm not sure this Judgement can be Appealed;
I'm not sure it's a Judgement at all. The reasons for my caution
will become apparent below.

If I were to defend the view (rather than merely articulate the
possibility, as above) that Chuck's 'Judgement' is really no
Judgement at all, I can imagine that this might raise eyebrows,
particularly those located on the noble forehead of Morendil. For I
did just argue in the case of his Injunctions, that they really were
Injunctions, even if inappropriately made. At first, I thought I
might be able to appeal to some kind of procedure/content
distinction: the claim would be that Morendil's Injunctions were
genuine Injunctions, because they were procedurally OK, but that they
were Wrongful Injunctions because they were inappropriate. But such a
strategy is hopeless, for a number of different reasons. Firstly,
it's not clear that Morendil's Injunctions *were* procedurally fine.
Neither Andre nor myself expressed any opinion; elJefe seems to be of
the opinion that they weren't.  Secondly, I think that if we *had*
found that the Injunctions were illegal as well as inappropriate, we
would still have thought that Morendil had committed the Infraction
of Wrongful Injunction, that is, we would have thought that the
Injunctions really were Injunctions, just illegal and inappropriate
ones. I myself argued as much against Morendil, when he sought to
evade the Infraction penalties by arguing that if his Injunctions
were illegal then they weren't really Injunctions at all and hence
he could not be punished for them. And I appealed to game custom
that previous illegally made Injunctions had been treated as
genuine Injunctions.

So, it would be difficult for me now to turn around and argue that
Chuck's Judgement, which is clearly procedurally flawed, is not
really a Judgement - hence my caution. Yet even if I accepted
that my previous arguments concerning Injunctions compel me to
accept Chuck's Judgement as a Judgement (if an illegally made one),
my troubles do not end there. For where and how does one draw the
line around what is to count as a Judgement? Is my hypothetical
example above (the Judgement of GLORK) a Judgement? Would a Judge
who had missed the deadline for Judging be able to point to any
post e had made to the PF, even on a completely different subject,
(eg a Kudo transfer) and claim that *that* was eir Judgement? If
not, why not?

Finally, a positive suggestion: perhaps we need some equivalent(s)
to the provision in R991 that "Any document submitted to the Clerk of
the Courts and which is clearly marked as a Call for Judgement is a
Call for Judgement." Eg: "Any document submitted to the Clerk of the
Courts by a duly authorized Judge of a CFJ, and which is clearly
marked as a ruling on that CFJ, is that Judge's ruling on that
CFJ." and something similar for Injunctions. That would mean that
Chuck's Judgement, Morendil's Injunctions and my GLORK example would
count as Judgements (or Injunctions), whatever their procedural
flaws. The Kudo transfer would not. I think this is a good idea.
I'll make a proto.

As I understand it, a if Group possessing Currencies dissolves, it
becomes a terminal estate and goes into Probate, with an Executor in
Probate being appointed to dispose of its assets, according to its
Will if there is one. However, this disposition of assets is not
retrospective, but occurs when the EiP executes whatever Transfer
Orders e is permitted or required to make to dispose of the assets.
