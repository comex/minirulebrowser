I don't think I'm interested in the Contest.  Further, the honors you

I don't see how this is a problem.  It would be illegal to review the
order except that a review of the order will find that it was invalid,
which means that it was not illegal to review the order.  You don't
have to discard presumptive validity even in this case, because there
is no penalty for disobeying orders which are eventually found to be
invalid.  (There's the risk that they won't be, admittedly, but, hey,
life is full of chances.)

The Herald has two choices, as I see it: follow your Order, or CFJ
alleging it to be invalid.  Since CFJing on the validity of a Private
or Administrative Order results in an automatic stay, e is excused
from abiding by that Order for the duration of litigation.  What's the
problem?  The Herald need not make a binding judicial determination;
e need only have sufficient doubt to put the matter in the hands of
the courts.  

As far as the risk of the Courts not agreeing: if they don't, then you
have 72 hours from when the stay is lifted after judgement to comply.
No Crime results if you promptly abide by the Court's determination.

You've forgotten the automatic stay.

Granted, I'm not in any terrible hurry, it just seemed that I'd gotten
all the comments there were out there.  Maybe I'm wrong.

Well, this is the reason I've deferred the proposal.  I do want all the
judicial ramifications to sort themselves out, now that we seem to have
a stable situation.

I don't know if the rules, as they are currently drafted support that. 
The Rules permit you to send a VT to the bank, or not, as you choose. 
But if there's a PO for a VT in your name, the fact that you normally
have such freedoms is not a defense against that Order.  If there was a
Judical Order, say, that required a Player to resign from an Office (for
whatever reason, we'll assume it's justified) does it seem a legitimate
defence against following the Order that the Players in general have the
right to resign whatever Offices they hold, or not, at their option.  It
is my *legal* opinion that there is no special case for voting
privelages, even under your NRE scheme--  after all, it certianly is
possible to draft a Group's Ordinances to forbid members from voting
against the wishes of the Group (I wouldn't join, but it is a possible
situation) is it your assertion that the members need not obey the SLC
of the Group in this case?  

Now, I do understand your feelings about voting-- this is why I posted
my notice, to get people's reaction to the idea-- but it seems to me
that you are letting your belief about what _should_ be true about the
rules influence your reasoning on what _is_ true of the rules.

Of course this is the main problem with the concept, which I guess would
be tantamout to civil disobediance.  I certianly don't want to do all
this just so I can allege a series of Class C Crimes on everybody.

So here's a real question--

If we go through the whole CFJ process, and discover that I, indeed,
have the powers I believe I have now.  Would the Agora public agree to
vote for my proposal in excange for a promise that they will not be
coersed by an Order from myself?  Basicly I am asking for a win (for
myself and Macross) in exchange for not using the loophole any further
than I already have.  (No, I am not going to threaten any dire things
if  the Players don't agree to this, everyone knows what my aims are.  I
am just feeling out the population, to see if they might consder it, as
a gesture.)
