Here is my first attempt at what a proposal should look like.  As I am 
new to Agora could somebody kindly tell me if this would be reasonable 
as a proposal.  [Note: I don’t care if the idea isn’t good just the 
layout, mainly.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
ProtoProposal Peekee
Changing of MUQ’s

Proposal of a new rule.

If the MUQ is increased for a specific currency, in accordance with 
rules then  entities with units of that currency that are fractions of 
the MUQ, shall have those fractions rounded up.  This rule takes 
precedence over rule 1577.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, I have a comment that's not exactly about the layout (which
is OK, except we usually like to be more precise and say something
like "A Rule shall be created with the following text"), but not
exactly about the idea itself either. :)  I would
write this as an amendment to Rule 1577, and not a separate rule
on its own.

And incidentally, welcome aboard!

Chuck

Welcome to Agora!

A couple of things:
1)  Turn off smart quotes or whatever it is called in your mailer/editor,
when writing Proposals.  That ’ is not an ASCII character.
2)  As Chuck said, we usually formulate Proposals as statements of how
Rules (and some other things) are changed.
3)  Standard indentation of new Rule text is 6 spaces, maximum width 70
characters.  And all forms in triplicate, um, scratch that last part.

As for the content, I think "increased" should be "changed", as the
problem being corrected could occur even if the MUQ is lowered (say, from
0.3 to 0.2.)

Nothing wrong with the concept, but it might be a problem getting enough
interest once Votes start getting a bit more expensive again, which should
happen soon now that the Treasuror Rule is in place.

Greetings,
Ørjan.
