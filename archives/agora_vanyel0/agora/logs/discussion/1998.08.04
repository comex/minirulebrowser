I fully intend to CFJ on this matter if necessary.  While I admit that my
intention was to cast a Vote, my poor choice of wording was not sufficient
to actually do so.

In case your CFJ is Judged TRUE you might want to resubmit your vote
privately.

You'd make a very poor auctioneer, Scott.

Auctioneer: Who'll give me 200,000 for this superb Edwardian mansion. Do
I hear 200,000?
Bidder: I'll bid 200,000.
Auctioneer: I'm sorry, madam, but that's not a bid, merely a statement
of intent to bid in the future.

I think in the context of that message, Macross clearly could and did
use the words "I'll vote FOR P3780" to cast a vote.

Proto-Proposal
Get Rid of 5 Offices

[Comment: in my opinion, the game could happily do without the
Offices of Scorekeepor, Cartographor, Archivist and Wizard - all of
which Offices I happen to be holding. These Offices are basically cruft,
and they put 7 BOS into the economy every week, about a third of all
Salaries. Getting rid of them would mean we could increase the BOS for
the Officers who actually do useful work. While I'm at it, I've also
proposed to get rid of Commander-in-Chief. In total, this Proposal would
repeal 29 Rules, a little cleaning out that's long overdue.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rules 1775 (Points and Scoring), 1776 (the
Scorekeepor), 1782 (Changing a Player's Score), 1783 (Ordering Changes
in a Player's Score), 1784 (The Omnibus Scoring Rule), 1790 (Buying
points), 1777 (Winning Scores), 1778 (Initiating an Endgame Procedure),
1779 (Challenging an Endgame Procedure), 1780 (Losing Eligibility to
Win) and 1781 (Termination of the Endgame Procedure) all be repealed.

Be it further resolved that Rules 1855 (Plots), 1856 (Adjacency), 1860
(Officers may not own Plots), 1843 (Buying and Selling Plots), 1844
(Winning by Ownership), 1845 (Structures), 1846 (Ergs), 1848 (Types of
Structures), 1849 (Maintenance of Structures), 1850 (Production of
Structures), 1851 (Standard Types of Structures), and 1857 (The
Cartographor) all be repealed.

Be it further resolved that Rules 1657 (The Archivist) and 417 (Duties of
the Archivist) be repealed.

Be it further resolved that R1370 (How To Get A Degree) be amended by
replacing in it the text which currently reads:

      The Archivist shall retain a copy of each Thesis posted in this
      manner.

with text which reads: 

      The Rulekeepor shall retain a copy of each Thesis posted in this
      manner.

Be it further resolved that R786 (Rule of Succession for Speaker or
Speaker-Elect) be amended by deleting from it the line which reads:
"the Archivist".

Be it further resolved that Rules 1543 (Style Points), 1543 (The
Wizard) and 1682 (Boors) all be repealed.

Be it further resolved that R1720 (The Militia) be repealed.

Yes. This means that if the Proposal passes, the ban on Presence will

Or a little longer, depending on how quickly the voting results are
published. 

Anyway, I could wait until the last day of the voting period and then
support the proposal by declaring presence on it - ah, the irony...

This is why I think an alternative model would be to have the nomic
game be conducted among people that are effectively the game wizards.
To the outside world, the MUD game would look just like a normal one,
but behind the scenes the various Gods would be squabbling and
politicking over the shape the world should have.  If you built in
some notion of worship for Gods, then the members of the nomic game
might even come to feel that they were representing their worshippers.

The SW approach is also workable inasmuch as it gives the nomic
players a world in which to play out their games.  You'd like to think
that the construction of a MUD-world would be clever enough so that
the Wizards never had to do anything in response to Player actions. 

On a similar note (the spontaneous establishment of economies and
social structures) I read quite an interesting article in Wired that
talked about the experience in the commercial MUD based on the Ultima
computer games.  There Player-killing (often a no-no on MUDs) is
allowed; and the game is a complete free-for-all, with the owners
hoping that some sort of structure will eventually evolve.

Steve, 
If you separate the major categories of your repeals into separate
proposals, say the cartography aspects from the others aspects, I would
be more inclined to vote for at least one of the resulting proposal.
Some of what you call cruft, I think of as pretty little complexities,
like victorian gingerbread.  I can't imagine Agora without the
Archivist.

Due to system problems at dfw.net, I've lost the latest batch of proposal
results.  Could someone send them to me?

Thanks,

Well, I for one would be willing to vote for this proposal, but not 
willing to spend the dough to vote on five separate proposals.

In case my CFJ is Judged False I might not want to resubmit my Vote
privately.  To do so in that case would increase the cost of the Vote beyond
what I am willing to pay.

I wouldn't assume that a Judgement of TRUE will save you from the
Infraction. If the phrase "a message containing votes" in the second
paragraph is interpreted as "message purporting to contain votes", then
the result is that (a) messages purporting to contain votes sent to the
PF are not votes (as the CFJ alleges), but also (b) sending such a message 
nevertheless constitutes the commission of an Infraction.

Proto-Proposal
Permanent Electioneering

[Comment: I think the temporary ban on Electioneering has been a success,
and I'd like to see it made permanent. Permitting the Assessor to use the
information in eir possession as a resource gives the Office much more
interest and scope for creative play.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rules 452 and 1652 be repealed.
