within a specified time does not obviate the requirement to perform the

If we're waiting for nits to fall out, then we're probably shaking those
little-used Rules, or putting them through a fine-tooth comb, rather
than exercising them. :)

I share your belief.

That is true, but the problem is easily solved: simply disallow Officers
from granting PoA to other Players. If an Officer wants to grant PoA to
someone, let them give up their Offices first.

Morendil asserts in his Judgement that all that the Rules require is
that a voting message clearly identify an existing Proposal. Two issues
arise here. Firstly, I think it is questionable whether Vlad's message
did *clearly* identify an existing Proposal. A reasonable person could
have taken Vlad's message as referring to either of two Proposals. But
that's old ground. What interests me more is this: on what basis did
Morendil conclude that clear idenitfication of an existing Proposal is
what the Rules require?

Proto-Proposal
Actions With Real Support

[Comment: the point of having Actions With N Supporters is surely that
the Support is supposed to come from other Players. Currently, a person
can Support their own action, which in the case of Actions With One
Supporter, is equivalent to simple authority to perform the action.]

Be it hereby resolved that R1874 (Actions With N Supporters) be amended
by replacing in it the text which currently reads:

      (b) between the two posts, N or more Players posted to the Public
          Forum supporting the change.

with text which reads:

      (b) between the two posts, N or more Players other than the Player
          intending to make the change posted to the Public Forum supporting 
	  the change.

Proto-Proposal
Grantors of PoA are removed from Office

[Comment: General Chaos has pointed out that the concept of Power of
Attorney undermines the restrictions placed on Delegation of Office.
The simplest fix would be to deny Officers the right to grant PoA. But
that might cause problems if the Grantor forgot to resign their Offices
and then left, believing PoA had been granted when it in fact it had not
(compare what would be the analogous case of denying Officers the right
to go On Hold). So instead I propose the next simplest solution: an
Officer who grants PoA is immediately removed from all Offices, just as
e would be if e went On Hold.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 1555 (Electees and Removal from Offices)
be amended by replacing in it the text which currently reads:

      If a Player goes On Hold, deregisters, or is deregistered, e shall
      be removed from all Offices e holds.

with text which reads:

      If a Player goes On Hold, grants Power of Attorney to another
      Player, deregisters, or is deregistered, e is removed from all
      Offices e holds.

This is incorrect, for the reasons given in my Caller's Arguments. R1842
makes me Kolja's sole Executor, and R1817 does not require the
Recordkeepor of a Currency to note transfers from a Player who is not
the Executor of the owner of the units of that Currency.

What this would mean if Kolja were to attempt to make a transfer of his
own Currency while I hold his PoA is not clear. Perhaps the Recordkeepor
would be permitted to note the transfer at eir discretion, and perhaps e
would not. I think that's a fascinating, and quite open, legal question.
But at the very least, while the PoA remains in effect, Kolja would
require the co-operation of the relevant Recordkeepor to make a transfer
of his own Currencies, something which we who are our own Executors do
not require. 

I do, however, accept the argument made by the other Justices that
Kolja's ability to revoke his grant of PoA at any time gives him
effective control over his assets, which control he shares with me.
If, however, some new legal development were to prevent Kolja from
revoking his PoA at any time, then Kolja's effective control over his
assets would cease.

Actually, I'd prefer to *de*regulate the coloring of pages.  It's
sufficient for the Rules to state what information needs to be
in the Registrar's report--let the Registrar choose how to present it.

Yeah.  I meant to respond to the proto, but got distracted

the greater.

I think it is a reasonable interpretation that a Will's provisions be implemented
based on the conditions that held at the time of deregistration.  Also, if no one
objects to the plan I have already posted, the question is moot anyway.

To be more precise, based on the wording of the Rule, it should be implemented
based on the conditions that held at the time the entity was placed in Probate.

You can't.  Rule 1807 limits the validity of Appellate Orders to
orders addressed to:
        a) The Clerk of the Courts in eir Official capacity;
        b) an Order issued by the Clerk of the Courts in eir Official
           Capacity;
        c) The Judge of the CFJ which that Board of Appeals was
           convened to consider, or any Order issued by that Judge in
           that particular CFJ; or
        d) any combination of the above.

You would have to order the Judge below to reinstate them.  An
alternative (permitted under (c) above) would be to vacate the Judge's
Order vacating the original Orders, which would work a reinstatement
of the original Order, per Rule 1802.  I would recommend the latter
approach.

I would like to redefine "Officer" so that it encompasses the Speaker,
Judges, and Justices, as well as all current Officers, and create a
new term for what we currently call "Officer".  Any suggestions?

Protoproposal Chaos240 [rev. 1]

Powers of Attorney

Be it resolved, that Rules 1841 and 1842 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 1, to read:

      (a) A Player (hereinafter, the Grantee) who lawfully holds Power
          of Attorney for another Player (hereinafter the Grantor) the
          Executor of the Grantor, and may act in the Grantor's behalf
          for as long as the Grantee lawfully holds the Power of
          Attorney. However, this power to act on the Grantor's behalf
          shall not extend to the performance of the privileges,
          duties, or powers of any Office held by the Grantee.

      (b) Power of Attorney is granted by Public Forum Announcement. 
          The announcement shall be posted by the Grantor and shall
          set forth:
        (1) the name of the Grantee; and
        (2) the dates upon which the grant shall begin and end.

      (c) A Player may grant Power of Attorney to another Player only
          if:
        (1) the Grantor has been continuously registered for the two
            months immediately prior to the announcement;
        (2) the Grantee is a Player and is not on Hold at the time of
            the announcement;
        (3) the grant is to begin within one week of the time of the
            announcement;
        (4) the grant is to end within three months of the time of the
            announcement; and
        (5) the Grantee does not hold Power of Attorney for more than
            one other Player at the time of the announcement.

      (d) A grant is terminated if:
        (1) the Grantee ceases to be a Player or goes on Hold;
        (2) the Grantor ceases to be a Player;
        (3) the Grantee fails to consent, by Public Forum
            Announcement, to the grant before the time the grant
            begins;
        (4) the grant's specified period expires; or
        (5) the Grantor cancels the grant, by Public Forum
            Announcement.

      (e) For the purpose of subdivision (a), the term "privileges,
          duties, or powers of any Office" includes those of the
          Speaker, and those of a Judge or Justice, if the Grantee
          holds any of these positions.

The complication is there to limit the otherwise unchecked power of a
Court of Appeals to issue Orders.  Otherwise, a troika of Justices
could willy-nilly issue an Order compelling every Player to bow down
before them, or any other grossly improper but presumptively valid
Order for which there is no mechanism for review.

Isn't "position of authority" already used to that effect in the Rules?

Thinking about it some more, I think it would be better if you left
"Officer" as it is now, and instead created a new term for the
broader concept.

I would suggest something like the following (feel free to use this):

An Authority is a Player who holds a position of responsibility
defined by the Rules, beyond the normal responsbilities of being a
Player or a Senator.  Authorities include but are not necessarily
limited to Officers, Judges, Justices, and the Speaker.

Protoproposal Chaos240 [rev. 2]

Powers of Attorney

Be it resolved, that Rules 1841 and 1842 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 1, to read:

|     (a) A Player (hereinafter, the Grantee) who lawfully holds a
|         grant of Power of Attorney for another Player (hereinafter
|         the Grantor) is, for the duration of that grant, the
          Executor of the Grantor, and may act in the Grantor's behalf
          for as long as the Grantee lawfully holds the Power of
          Attorney. However, this power to act on the Grantor's behalf
|         shall not extend to the performance of any privilege, duty,
|         or power of any Office held by the Grantee.

      (b) Power of Attorney is granted by Public Forum Announcement. 
          The announcement shall be posted by the Grantor and shall
          set forth:
        (1) the name of the Grantee; and
        (2) the dates upon which the grant shall begin and end.

      (c) A Player may grant Power of Attorney to another Player only
          if:
        (1) the Grantor has been continuously registered for the two
            months immediately prior to the announcement;
        (2) the Grantee is a Player and is not on Hold at the time of
            the announcement;
        (3) the grant is to begin within one week of the time of the
            announcement;
        (4) the grant is to end within three months of the time of the
|           announcement;
|       (5) the Grantee holds a grant of Power of Attorney for at most
|           one other Player at the time of the announcement; and the
|           Grantee has not granted Power of Attorney to anyone else.

      (d) A grant is terminated if:
        (1) the Grantee ceases to be a Player or goes on Hold;
        (2) the Grantor ceases to be a Player;
        (3) the Grantee fails to consent, by Public Forum
            Announcement, to the grant before the time the grant
            begins;
|       (4) the grant's specified period expires;
|       (5) the Grantee grants Power of Attorney to anyone else; or
|       (6) the Grantor cancels the grant, by Public Forum
            Announcement.

|     (e) For the purpose of subdivision (a), the term "privilege,
|         duty, or power of any Office" includes those of the Speaker,
|         and those of a Judge or Justice, with respect to a Grantor
|         who holds any of these positions.

Protoproposal Chaos240 [rev. 3]

Powers of Attorney

Be it resolved, that Rules 1841 and 1842 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 1, to read:

      (a) A Player (hereinafter, the Grantee) who lawfully holds a
          grant of Power of Attorney for another Player (hereinafter
          the Grantor) is, for the duration of that grant, the
          Executor of the Grantor, and may act in the Grantor's behalf
          for as long as the Grantee lawfully holds the Power of
          Attorney. However, this power to act on the Grantor's behalf
          shall not extend to the performance of any privilege, duty,
          or power of any Office held by the Grantee.

      (b) Power of Attorney is granted by Public Forum Announcement. 
          The announcement shall be posted by the Grantor and shall
          set forth:
        (1) the name of the Grantee; and
        (2) the dates upon which the grant shall begin and end.

      (c) A Player may grant Power of Attorney to another Player only
          if:
        (1) the Grantor has been continuously registered for the two
            months immediately prior to the announcement;
        (2) the Grantee is a Player and is not on Hold at the time of
            the announcement;
        (3) the grant is to begin within one week of the time of the
            announcement;
        (4) the grant is to end within three months of the time of the
            announcement;
        (5) the Grantee holds a grant of Power of Attorney for at most
|           one other Player at the time of the announcement; and
|       (6) the Grantee has not granted Power of Attorney to anyone
|           else.

      (d) A grant is terminated if:
        (1) the Grantee ceases to be a Player or goes on Hold;
        (2) the Grantor ceases to be a Player;
        (3) the Grantee fails to consent, by Public Forum
            Announcement, to the grant before the time the grant
            begins;
        (4) the grant's specified period expires;
        (5) the Grantee grants Power of Attorney to anyone else; or
        (6) the Grantor cancels the grant, by Public Forum
            Announcement.

      (e) For the purpose of subdivision (a), the term "privilege,
          duty, or power of any Office" includes those of the Speaker,
          and those of a Judge or Justice, with respect to a Grantor
          who holds any of these positions.

Yes, but I'd rather not have a term which is not clearly defined.  An
uppity Judge might decide that being a Senator is a "position of
authority", for example.
