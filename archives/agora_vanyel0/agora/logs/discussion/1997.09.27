In an attempt to clarify somewhat, I think it is important to emphasize
that the Rule pertaining to Mintorless Currencies doesn't "get a look at
the Game State" not because it is magically held in abeyance, but because
it is false to construe the destruction and creation of a Mintor as two
seperate events (to use Steve's terminology). They are simply part of a
single event, the implementing of the Proposal. Therefore, the only Rules
that we need concern ourselves with are those regarding the legality of a
particular Proposal, and the implementation thereof. In other words, the
so-called destruction of the Mintor did not actually occur independently.
Its as if I ordered you to wash the dishes. Doing so requires you to fill
the sink with water, add soap, etc. But I did not specifically command you
to do any of those things. Thus, if we had a house Rule that said I was to
pay you a dollar every time I asked you to fill the sink with water,
technically, I don't owe you anything, although I would probably
understand if you became angry at that. That's why I think each situation
has to be analyzed independently. Hope I got that right.

The judge's reasoning in CFJ 815 which Morendil just posted contains the lines

>    Rule number.  Similarly, if all the Rules that provide
>    for an Entity to exist at all are repealed without
>    simultaneous replacement, the only permissible change

This implies that simultaneous replacement is possible.  Does that impose any 
obligation on judges of other CFJ's, or is it too indirect?

I ask because in the rules interpretation that Morendil and Steve seem to be 
advocating (assuming I haven't confused myself in reading all these threads), 
simultaneous replacement isn't possible.

Bad idea. As far as I can see, the standard penalty for not making a
decision on a Judgement is greater - a 3 Blot Infraction - than the
penalty for making a wrong one - basic Rule 1565 violation, 1 Blot from
Rule 1439.

Not that I think you are in much danger in this case.

The idea that the Rules describe a "machine" is a rather Platonic
viewpoint.  The Pragmatic viewpoint tends to disavow that idea.

Exactly.  It is probably impossible to legislately handle every case
that might potentially come up.  As someone else has noted, fools are
very ingenious.  There is a point at which the complexity involved in
attempting to handle increasingly pathological cases overwhelms the
benefit of doing so, especially when the required complexity
introduces ambiguity, or worse, loopholes.

Ah, I see your point now.  I don't justify them, under the current
Rules--I'm talking more about what I think the Rules should be.
I think I favor the recent Proto by Vir, wherein the Rules may
prevent a Game State Change from taking effect, but no other
collateral effects are permitted.

Here's a somewhat radical idea: people probably won't like it,
but I'll throw it out for discussion: have proposal authors
divide proposals into sections.  (If not so divided, the
entire proposal consists of one section.)  Each section is
applied as a whole; if a section would produce any illegal effects
(after it is completed, not during the operation of the
section), the entire section is nullified.  The whole of
the Rules are applied after each section.

I've done a bit of gunzipping and untarring, and people interested in
Agoran history of science might wish to download one of my old email
folders (34K) at

<http://www.nvg.ntnu.no/~oerjan/science>

which contains 12 messages, mostly mine, of the Walrus debate, from
February 25/26 1994.

Greetings,
Oerjan.

It's not the Speaker succession Rules, it is the Lawlessness Rule:

      If the Lawless Player was the Speaker, the Speaker-Elect first
      immediately becomes Speaker, and the old Speaker ceases to be
      Speaker.

What you are calling loopholes and fools would in Agora be called scams
and scamsters. Seeing as how we like to encourage the occasional Scam, it
is important that there be a reasonably objective way of interpreting the
Rules, especially in the rare and "pathological" cases where scam
potential might exist. 

Remember the letter from Ronald Kunne, one of our great Scamsters, which
Steve recently posted:

]Apart from the time problem, I stopped because I realized that it was

My dismissal was couched in the same terms as Morendil's. So my dismissal
is conditional on the success of Morendil's anyway. I just made it
explicit.

No, just unusal - IMHO Rule 594 permits simultaneity if the Proposal
specifies it.

Yes, but the Mintor of VTs nevertheless ceased to exist...

There are, in my opinion, two types of loopholes.  One type is that
which arises because of an oversight or error in the authorship of the
Rules.  These are honest loopholes, and the scamsters that use them
are honest scamsters.  Such loopholes are generally quite clear, once
pointed out.  The other type is those that arise from deliberately
perverted interpretations of the Rules.  Loopholes which only exist
under particularily perverted interpretations of the Rules are not
loopholes.

In my opinion, there's a difference between looking for honest
loopholes and intentionally creating pathologies.  I respect the
former; I do not respect the latter.

Right.  The second amendment to Rule 1551 that appears in Proposal
3445 is a null amendment regardless of whether it's applied to the new
version of Rule 1551, or the old version.

Whether or not the Rules specified the order in which the provisions
are applied at the time the double amendment to Rule 1551 depends, at
least in part, on the resolution of the question at hand.  Rule 594
was amended to its present state by another Rule Change in Proposal
3455, appearing prior to the double amendment of Rule 1551. :)

My idea was that a firm Dismissal rather than a conditional one would
protect you against committing the Infraction of Failing to Judge, even if
the Dismissal were not legal. After all, the Rules seem to treat an
illegal Dismissal as something which takes effect but may be Appealed.

Also, discussion which writes our game procedures in programming-language
form is necessarily assuming the non-simultaneous viewpoint.  This is very
natural if we Agora is seen as reflecting computation, and not very natural
if Agora is seen as reflecting life.

(Though I've dealt with machines that are happy to reverse steps in a
computation on the fly, if the steps commute.)

For that matter, we don't have any reason to believe that the
Agora-machine is not infinitely parallel, or, for that matter,

It's not always easy to draw the border, witness the Mousetrap Scam.
Also, perverting a Rule's meaning to create a loophole shows that
that Rule was vulnerable to such a manipulation, and in most cases
an improved Rule is the result.

Me, I find both types of Scam entertaining, it's only when invective
rather than useful debate emerges from a pathological case that I
find no merit in the latter. (Sad to say, the Mousetrap was *also* a 
borderline case in this respect.)

> >Yes, but the Mintor of VTs nevertheless ceased to exist...
> 
> Whether it did or not is the question at hand.

Sorry, I'd meant the above sentence as a prelude to a neat refutation 
of the notion that atomicity would save VTs, but it wouldn't come 
together that time. I kept the prelude, though, to remind me; and 
here comes the refutation...

Remember that the scenario in which VTs are destroyed is as follows;
Initial State : 1470 defines the Mint; 1696 makes the Mint VT Mintor
* 3533 amends 1470 to no longer define the Mint
* 1586 cause the Mint to be destroyed
* 1579 causes all VTs to be destroyed
* 3533 amends 1696 to define the Bank as VT Mintor

Scott's version of the notion of 'atomicity' (for all I know there
may be others) depends on the assertion that "mechanistic functions
of the Rules are held in abeyance until the Proposal is fully
implemented", which I'll now need to rephrase in the terms of
another well-accepted paradigm, in order to draw some interesting
conclusions from it.

Lemma : restatement of Rule 594

   When a Proposal is adopted, the Nomic Properties of any entities
   named therein are altered according to that Proposal's provisions,
   to the maximal extent permitted by the Rules.

Principle of Atomicity : 

   Subsequent to the adoption of any given Proposal, no change to a 
   Nomic Property of any entity may occur before all the changes to
   Nomic Properties specified by that Proposal that are permissible 
   have been implemented.

This leads to the following radically different, scenario :
Initial State : 1470 defines the Mint; 1696 makes the Mint VT Mintor
* Proposal 3533 is adopted
* 3533 amends 1470 to no longer define the Mint
* 3533 amends 1696 to define the Bank as VT Mintor
* Collateral effects of 3533, if any, occur.

OK so far ?

What Scott claims is that Rule 1579 never 'had a chance' to destroy
VTs because the switch in Mintors occurs 'inside' 3533 and is never
visible outside of it. 

The fallacy becomes blindingly obvious if you reason in terms of
Nomic Properties and the restatements of Rule 594 and Scott's own
notion of atomicity : Proposal 3533 in fact never changed any Nomic
Property of the Mint, or of the Bank, or of VTs; it merely effected
Rule Changes - which are, themselves, alterations of the Nomic
Properties of a particular subset of entities, the Rules themselves. 

All other changes to Nomic Properties occurring as a result of 3533
therefore resulted *after* 3533 was fully adopted. Of course, we now
face the same problem that faced us before the notion of atomicity
was even introduced : in what order, if any, did these alterations
occur ? Rule 1586 tells us that the Bank has its Nomic Properties
altered to match the new 1696, and that the Mint loses all Nomic
Properties as a result of the new 1470 no longer defining it, but
obviously the fate of VTs is very different according to which
occurs first.

IMHO, therefore, not only doesn't atomicity save VTs, it is entirely
useless in solving the problem posed by 933, which is currently the
only reason why we have to probe so deep into the detailed workings
of Proposal adoption; whereas the competing theory adequately
accounts for the fate of VTs when restated in terms of Nomic 
Properties, as follows :

Lemma : restatement of Rule 594

   When a Proposal is adopted, the Nomic Properties of any entities
   named therein are altered according to that Proposal's provisions,
   to the maximal extent permitted by the Rules.

Principle of Ordering

   Changes to Nomic Properties of any entities occur one after the 
   other. Whenever one Nomic Property is altered, any changes 
   required directly or indirectly by the Rules as a result of that
   alteration shall occur before any changes occur that are not 
   required by the Rules. Changes required by the Rules shall occur 
   in order of Rule precedence. In all other cases, changes to Nomic
   Properties shall occur in chronological, then textual order.

(This draws from 1527, 1030 and 1482.)

What would be the benefit of seperating your proposal into sections?

No, the Principle of Atomicity is:

    A proposal is implemented as a whole simulatenously, with no time 
    in between the changes of the various Nomic Properties involved.

More or less right, but it really should be:
* Proposal 3533 is adopted
  * 3533 amends 1470 to no longer define the Mint, and 269 to define 
    the Bank as VT Mintor
* Collateral effects occur

How do you come to this conclusion? It's perfectly consistent for the 
changes in Nomic Properties of the rules to simultaneously change the 
Nomic Properties of other entities. I think.

This is just plain silly. The changes don't have to have an order, 
which is an unstated assumption of yours.

All you've shown is that you can restate the current debate in terms 
of whether the Principle of Ordering must hold, which, IMHO, isn't 
true. In particular, I will not accept the first sentence as an 
assumption without proof.

Here's a quick example of *why* I don't accept it:
Assume that the Principle of Ordering is true.

If, for example, Morendil were to transfer a Kudo from Blob to Elde, 
multiple changes in Nomic Properies would occur: The ownership of 
that Kudo, Blob's Honor, and Elde's Honor. However, if the later two 
Nomic Properties change one after the other, then either the Kudo is 
momentarily owned by both of them, or it is momentarily owned by 
neither one, splitting a single change in a Nomic Property (the 
Kudo's ownership) into two.

There's no logical reason why this can't be the way things work, but 
Occam's Razor makes me reject the Principle of Ordering until I am 
provided with a proof that it holds (or that it actually simplifies 
things, which seems unlikely).

Proposal 3533 established law which dictates the properties of the
Mint, the Bank, and VTs (amongst others) as a matter of law.  The
amendments to the Rules that are the direct result of Proposal 3533 do
not "set in motion" a consequent change of properties in fact; they
change, directly, the legal fictions that apply to the Mint, the Bank,
and VTs (amongst others).  There is no consequent change of the
matters of fact because the matters of fact are completely obscured by
the legal fictions.  It is impossible to determine, as a matter of
fact separate from the law, who the Mintor of VTs is, or even if the
Currency of Voting Tokens exists.

If some Rule declared that "The Bank shall mint a Currency called VTs,
...", then I would admit your argument; in this case, VTs would not
exist until the Bank actually performed the mandated action.  However,
this is not the language of the Rules.  Instead, the situation is that
the existence of VTs, and all the properties therefore, including
their Mintor, are mandated as legal fictions.  Thus, there is no delay
at all in the recognition of these new legal fictions upon the
complete and full adoption of Proposal 3533.

Not quite.  You're confusing the changing of properties which exist
separately from the Rules from those which are mandated by the Rules.
This is the distinction between matters of fact (which must be changed
by the action of animate entities) and matters of law (which are
dictated by the establishment of legal fictions within the Rules).

Fallacy here: One of either a Player's Honour or the ownership of a

Indeed, if the judgement of CFJ 933 is upheld, I fully expect to see all
such Infractions properly reported. If the way of playing Agora is to 
accept the consequences of our game-shattering actions, whatever they
might be, then we should apply that to this issue as well.

I am convinced that the current discussion is dancing on the fine edge
of the paradox of self-amendment.  I have a vague feeling that the
reductionary approach that Morendil is advocating walks nearer that
edge, but I can't substantiate that feeling, at least not yet.

Ross> Epiphe-what? Perhaps I should keep a dictionary around here...

Epiphenomenal properties are those properties of an entity which are
not directly manipulable, but are the direct logical consequence of
some other property, or combination of properties, of that entity (or
even of more than one entity).  An example of an epiphenomenal
property of an entity is its age, which is a direct logical
consequence of the time of its creation and the present time.

Another example, given by Douglas Hofstadter in, oh, was it _GEB_ or 
_Metamagical Themas_?, is the number of simultaneous users which a given 
computer system can support without slowdown to the point of unusability. 
Say a certain FTP system can handle 32 users pretty well, but 33 users 
just seems to push it too far; it's not as though you could do a 
find-and-replace on the system's source code, changing the number '32' 
to, say, '64.' That number is an epiphenomenal property.

BTW, has anyone read or started D.H.'s new book (_Le ton beau de Marot_)? 
I have it checked out from the library, and I've started, but it'll be a 
while before I can get back to it, I think.

Definitely not - by definition, any "change of a Nomic Property" is
a mechanistic effect of the Rules, and does not occur 'within' a
Proposal.

One which even Scott (I think) grants, abandoning simultaneity in 
favor of the admittedly more fruitful theory of atomicity.

I'm not giving proof; I've already stated why I think total ordering 
is a necessary assumption, viz., because simultaneity easily leads to 
indeterminate results, whereas total ordering leaves no doubt as to 
the resulting game state.

It doesn't bother me in the least that a Kudo should be for an
'instant', logical or temporal, be unowned. In fact nowhere in the
Rule will you find anything to hint that this might be disallowed;
why should it be a problem ? I identify a minimum of three NP
changes as a result of the above Kudo transfer :

  i) Blob's Honor decreases by one;
  ii) Elde's Honor increases by one;
  iii) Morendil's weekly Kudo transfer allotment decreases by one

Since, by Ordering, nothing else can occur in between these events, 
except for Rule-mandated NP changes, the complete scenario goes

  i) Blob's Honor decreases by one;
(any Rule-mandated changes as a result)
  ii) Elde's Honor increases by one;
(any Rule-mandated changes as a result, such as Elde becoming Samurai)
  iii) Morendil's weekly Kudo transfer allotment decreases by one
(any Rule-mandated changes as a result)

And the game state resulting from that is perfectly identified. 
Ordering of the decrease/increase pair is mandated by "textual 
order", i.e. the Rules speak of transfers "from a Player to another 
Player".

Regarding your invoking Occam's razor, I'm sure it does not apply; I
make no more hypotheses, nor postulate more entities, than are
strictly needed to come up with a complete model of the phenomenon
that I study. Simultaneity is simpler than ordering, but it fails to
fully specify the game state resulting from any given set of
simultaneous changes (just to offer an example, the simultaneous
destruction of a Mintor and instatement of a new Mintor).

I guess this is precisely the objection one must expect from a
Jurist. ;) 

And the Principle of Ordering certainly smacks of Platonism, but
then again there *is* a basis for Platonism in Agora, isn't there ?
It seems that you were quite right in pointing to a tendency for this
whole discussion to bring back Agora's classic ideological divide.

By Rule 1011, no Nomic Properties exist "separately from the Rules",
and I was specifically referring to Nomic Properties. But I guess I 
get your meaning here.

> Proposal 3533 established law which dictates the properties of the
> Mint, the Bank, and VTs (amongst others) as a matter of law. There

> Tokens exists.

Well, individual VTs are also legal fictions, aren't they ? Or to put
that another way, given the existence of the Currency-destroying
clauses in Rule 1579, is there a basis for the assertion that VT
holdings have a basis in fact separate from the law ? Or, in other
words, doesn't Rule 1579 make the legal fiction of my possessing
however many VTs it is dependent on there being a legally defined
Mintor for VTs ? 

Now, the answer to that last question may be 'yes' and it would still 
be possible to defend the assertion that, the effects of Proposal 
3533 as a whole being to substitute one legal fiction regarding the 
Mintor of VTs for another, Rule 1579 did not govern.

But this does, however, make your own distinction between
'mechanistic effects' of the Rules and other kinds of effects rather
suspect; I hope you'll grant as much; the 'mechanistic' aspect of 
1579 was not at issue in that particular case.

> This is the distinction between matters of fact (which must be
> changed by the action of animate entities) and matters of law
> (which are dictated by the establishment of legal fictions within
> the Rules). 

OK, granting your point of view for a moment; if we were still using
the old paradigm in which Proposals were only permitted to contain
Rule Changes, I would find no fault with your argumentation.

However, Proposals can now have an effect not merely on matters of
law, but also on matters of fact - unless I completely misunderstand
your notion of 'matters of fact'. That is, a Proposal could, for
instance, directly specify that I possess 100 VTs. Exactly what does
this mean from your point of view ? Certainly such a provision does
not change law - a Proposal is not a Rule, and I would think it is
not possible for a Proposal, by itself, to establish a legal
fiction.

Ironically, I am steadily gaining sympathy for your point of view - 
now that you have revealed more of the underlying assumptions, and 
the notion of 'atomicity' turns out to be a consequences of these 
assumptions rather than an a priori decision as to how Proposals 
should be understood to function - but, unfortunately, I do not 
think it is applicable to Agora as it is _now_, with its weird mix of 
Platonism, Pragmatism and what all else.

I don't quite feel the same way. IMHO the reductionary
('reductionary' ? does that mean more or less the same as
'reductionist', or if not, what exactly ?) approach is more a 
consequence of Agora's focus on game-like behaviour.

Interesting concept. My basic Platonistic view could be summarized:  The
entire abstract gamestate is an epiphenomenal property that is a logical
consequence of Agora's initial Ruleset and the history of relevant
real-world events (mostly but not exclusively Player messages).

Add 3% hypocrisy, and stir well. :-)

Possible precedent:  Someone once listed 12 "hard-core" Players (who had been
Players almost continuously for over two years, I think) and suggested that I

Okay. (Except when you get hit by a *$%@* Ghost Bat... sorry, wrong 
game)

So, how do we tell which NPs are epiphe-whatsit and which are 'real'?

FWIW, I kind of expected someone to point out what you did (but not

Throwing a question out to the masses:

Would anyone see any value in restarting something like the Agora Digest? 
For anyone who doesn't remember or wasn't here, it was a project of mine 
'back in my day' wherein, once a week or so, I posted a summary of the 
week's events, including proposals, protos, honour changes, judgements, 
CFJs, etc. I liked doing it mainly because it forced me to keep up with 
what was going on. But I don't know if it actually serves any purpose; 
any comments? This came up because I was looking at some old ones; 
interesting. In fact, I'll append one here, just to remind everyone what 
they were like:

BTW, I notice one interesting...mistake? faux pas? Whatever. (I think).


----------------------------------------------------------------------
                       The Agora Digest, 10/6/94
----------------------------------------------------------------------


-------------------- Proposals --------------------

1065. Kelly: Amend R.936 so that Players can submit up to two free 
proposals.

1067. Steve: Don't change Rule Numbers when the Rules change.
1068. Steve: <Part of package 1067>

1071. Kelly: Mutate 102 to MI 3.
1072. Kelly: Mutate 105 to MI 3.
1073. Kelly: Mutate 106 to MI 3.
1074. Kelly: Mutate 108 to MI 3.

              game to back to the Bank.
1081-1254. Chuck: Repeal almost all Mutable Rules. Too numerous to 
           list here.
1255. Vanyel: Weekly taxes of 1% of all Marks over 1.00 for Players,
              and all Marks whatsoever for Groups, etc.

-------------------- Proto-Proposals --------------------

Please note: Unless the word "PROTO" is in the subject of a message
  containing a Proto-Proposal, I cannot GUARANTEE that it will be
  included here.


Vlad: * Change Rule 956 so Rules must directly change actions required
        of or forbidden to the "position of Speaker," instead of 
        "Speaker."
      * Apple III, another proposed overhaul of the Judicial system in the
        grand tradition of Apples I and II.

Kelly: * A whole slew of proto's designed to get rid of the distinction
         between Immutables, Semimutables, and Mutables.

ChrisM: * Patent Title "Scoundrel". Given to any Player who is 
deregistered
          while in office.
        * Require Assistant to keep a current copy of all official 
documents.

Chuck: * Clean up Speaker Transfer

Waggie: * Change CFJ's to Judgement by Tribunal with one Representative 
          from each Group.

-------------------- Judicial Record --------------------

I. Callings.
------------

700. Caller Chuck, Judge elJefe. Lee's attempt at changing his name to 
     "the Point Sucker" had no effect.
701. Caller Kelly, Judge Timothy. The first paragraph of Rule 1011 does
     not restrict changes to Players.
702. Caller Stella?, Judge jeffrey s. Rule 1040 means that a Player can't
     lose more Marks then e has.
703. Caller Oerjan, Judge Chuck. Players who forfeit under Rule 1042 are
     not deregistered.
704. Caller Stella?, Judge Kojen. Effectively identical to CFJ 700.

II. Judgements.
---------------

700. FALSE. See statement in this Digest. This will require a change in
     the Ruleset as distributed recently by Chuck.
701. FALSE. See statement in this Digest. APPEALED.
703. FALSE. See statement in this Digest.

-------------------- Scores, Wealth, Honour, Oaths --------------------

Highpoints of the Honour:

   Kelly is high Kudo holder with:  26
   Coren jumps to:                  24

   Stella? loses another:           14
   jeffrey s. gains a bit:          17

The High Scores:
   
   Name              Score    Needed to win
   Kojen             177.0       (359.9)
   Chuck             135.0       (315.1)
   Coren              86.0       (270.0)
   Oerjan             75.0       (315.1)
   Stella?            50.7       (315.1)

And the Wealthiest:

   54.04       KoJen
   31.99       Chuck
   25.35       Bowen
   11.57       Coren
   10.92       Michael


-------------------- Group News --------------------

* Several Players have transferred Points to the Reform Group Treasury.

* PROSIRUP seems to FINALLY be gone, with the deregistration of Garth.
  As is usual with PROSIRUP, the change is not certain.

-------------------- Ideas --------------------

* The terms "Yankee" and "Hoosier" have come under close scrutiny. It has
  been determined that anyone who calls themselves a "Yankee" must
  logically BE a Yankee, although this conclusion is questioned by some.
        
* Is not doing something an action? Is it an action NOT to send someone 
Marks?
  Yet another philosophical point to ponder.

* There's been a LOT of discussion about a new CFJ system, with multiple
  Judges. Waggie especially has been very vocal in accusing the current
  system of being elitist.

-------------------- Other News --------------------

* Garth has apparently been experiencing mail problems, and seems to have 
been
     deregistered due to inactivity.

* Kelly has announced a "proposal drafting service." She'll take your 
ideas
  and turn them into viable proposals, for a fee. Half the fee is refunded
  if the proposal does not pass.
 
* Chuck has proposed the repeal of almost all Mutable rules, in an effort 
to 
  move along the trimming of the Ruleset. Reactions have varied.

* Josh Higham is a Player. His nickname is Einstein.

Good question.  I don't have a good answer.  I suspect, to borrow a
phrase, that "[t]his is an area which is particularily susceptible to
common sense." :)

This isn't an unreasonable position, actually.  It just runs into that
damnable undetected error problem. :)
