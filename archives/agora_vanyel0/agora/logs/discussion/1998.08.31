Um, I'm not sure how to understand that first sentence. First you say
that the cases are symmetric if a conflict arises, then you say that
there is an asymmetry if a conflict arises.

I agree that my view has the consequence that similarly worded Rules
will be treated quite differently, depending on whether they are
regarded as conflict-avoiding or conflict-deferring. But I think the
view is pretty much forced on us by the way the Rules about precedence
are written. And I also think that it's not too hard to tell the
difference, when it is necessary to do so.

Just to make it clear, I do not consider this to be a debility of your
approach.  Statutory interpretation is invariably laced with subtle
distinctions.  Contrast, for example, Mullaney v. Wilber, 421 U.S. 684
(1975) and Patterson v. New York, 432 U.S. 197 (1977), on the issue of
the statutory definition of murder and the obligation of the state
under due process to prove each element of a crime "beyond a
reasonable doubt".

Interesting indeed. Agora's Rule 1631 specifies that Agora's liaison to
InterNomic is the Ambassador, which is Murphy, while the InterNomic
Rules say that it can't be Murphy. Who wins such a conflict? Do the
InterNomic Rules have the resources to settle it in some way?

Um, no, I meant that there is an asymmetry in whether conflict arises or
not.

This *is* the initial Payment Order.  As it states, you owe 2 Indulgences and 2
VTs to the Bank.  You have a week to pay before you start getting hit with
Persistent Indebtedness infractions at a cost of 1 Indulgence per week per
currency type.

Where was the initial Payment order for this?  I can't find it.  If
this is it, How much do I owe?

OK, I am blind.  Where does it state I owe 2 VT's?  I see it dings me
for failing to report, but now the amount.

I disagree. When I took over as Ackanomic liaison the previous liaison, Guy
Fawkes, left without announcing a successor. Nobody questioned my ability to
take over at the time. I'm sure that this is not the only time this has
happened either. Game custom seems to allow a player of a nomic to take over
as liaison with a minimum of fuss, so I don't see why we should prefer any
different interpretation.

Mr, Tambourine Man, Liaison for Ackanomic.

I should think so, sitting as you are on 30 Blots. Still, you're not
quite Lawless yet: R1714 calls for "more than 30 Overdue Blots" - so,
firstly you'll have to be hit with a 31st Blot, and secondly, wait a
week until it, too, becomes Overdue.

After that, things get interesting. If anyone alleges that you are
Lawless, you'll be deregistered. BUT, R1747 gives the CotC the power to
Pardon Lawless Players, which would allow you to reregister. Michael has
given no indication one way or the other about his willingness to use
this power. But he can only use the power once in each term of Office -
and Harlequin is fast coming up behind you in the Lawlessness stakes, on
27 Blots according to the latest Herald's Report.

So, one possibility is a bidding war between you and Harlequin for the
favours of the CotC.

The other possibility, of course, signalled by your Rebellion, is a
Revolt. But Rebellion, as we know, is risky.
