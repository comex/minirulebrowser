I'll see about addressing that in the next version.

Incidentally, would someone please send me a copy of my most recent

Right.

Although I haven't decided for sure how *I* would decide this CFJ, I do have a
problem with this argument.  Specifically, sentences involving the "King of
France in 1997" are not necessarily meaningless just because there is no such
King.  For instance, "Is Morendil the King of France in 1997?" is not a
meaningless sentence.  It's a meaningful sentence to which the answer is "No". 

Sentences like "If x then y" are semantically equivalent to the two sentences
"Is x true? If the answer is yes, then y".  Now, I would not consider the
sentence, "Is the Sponsor of a Disinterested Proposal the same as that
Proposal's Proposer?", to be a meaningless sentence.  I would say it's the same
as my King of France example.  It's meaningful, but the answer is "No, because
the Proposal has no Sponsor".  Before I could judge the CFJ "True", I would
have to be convinced that the relevant sentence is not equivalent to the above
construction in the case of Disinterested Proposals.  I'm open to arguments
about this, but my tendency at the moment is to consider them as equivalent and
therefore that the relevant sentence is meaningful and operates properly wrt
Disinterest.

For the mathematically minded, I would say that the value of the logical
construction "x not equal y" is well defined even when x or y are null, i.e.
the statement is true if either x or y is null and the other is not.

But this question is not logically equivalent to "Is Morendil the
same person as the King of France in 1997 ?". The former does not
assume the existence of such a person, whereas the latter does. I 
suppose this is the core of Steve's argument.

True.  But the invalid assumption does not render the question meaningless,
IMO.  It still has a definite answer, "No", which is justified with the further
information that there is no King of France in 1997.  The question to me, then,
is whether Rule sentences with predicates that make assumptions which may be
false under some circumstances, should be considered completely ineffective
under those circumstances or whether those circumstances simply affect the
truth or falsity of the predicate.  The latter seems more natural to me, but I
would love to see a justification for the former.  I also suspect that choosing
the former interpretation, if applied uniformly, will get us into trouble in
other circumstances - but I haven't had time to think up a good example.

This is, I believe, the construction I adopted when making my original
interpretation.  I think it more closely represents the natural
meaning of language in this case.  It may be that a strict adherence
to the method of construction that Crito outlines above may lead to
seemingly paradoxical constructions in some cases.  My response to
that is that one should simply not adhere to that method in such
cases, but should instead apply a different method which does not
yield paradox in those cases.  Legal reasoning does not seek to avoid
paradox, but to accomodate it by circumventing it.  (It is my belief
that all nontrivial legal systems contain inherent paradoxes.)

I think the two questions are essentially equivalent semantically,
even if they have different representations in certain formal
languages.  After all, the sentence "Is Morendil the King of France?"
(clearly false) can be translated into formalisms that mean "Is the
entity whose name is Morendil the same as the entity which is the King
of France?" (indeterminate).  The suspect process here is the
translation, not the original statement.  Finding the "proper"
formalization of a given natural language statement is a difficult and
often contentious process.

I assert that a system of legal reasoning must necessarily be more
flexible than strict logical reasoning because systems of legal
reasoning must be able to cope with poorly defined and paradoxical
situations without imploding.  A "unanswerable" response to a question
is not acceptable in a legal context, at least not when that question
forms the heart of the dispute at law.

(I also seem to recall that there is a canon of interpretation
established in our Game Custom that requires that the Rules be
construed so as to deprive meaning of the smallest portion of the
Rules necessary to avoid a paradox.  This canon is suggestive of
denying Steve's argument; Steve asserts that we should deny meaning to
a portion of the Rules, when a reasonable interpretation exists which
grants meaning to that same portion without engendering a paradox.)

I agree with Crito, which is why when this argument was used in CFJ 1074, I
based my finding on a different argument.  To wit:

>
>I would like to judge this TRUE.  The facts and Rules are as noted by the

Thus I interpret the antecedent of the sentence as being False rather than
meaningless.
