Hm, yes, now that I think back more carefully I think you're right about
the FM. But I still think that the argument from the case of the FM to
conclusions about self-modifying and other-modifying Rules *in general*
is a poor one. For the FM was a pretty atypical kind of case: a cluster
of Rules operating repeatedly to amend one of the cluster, and what is
more, doing so in a way such that the calculation of future amendments
depended critically on the results of past amendments. In other words, a
feedback loop. Given those particular and highly unusual circumstances,
any error that went undetected for any length of time was guaranteed in
that case to have cascading effects. This is, you are right to point
out, a recipe for disaster, and so it proved. But the fault in that case
was due to the particular way in which the FM worked (ie the feedback
loop); the Virus suffered from no such difficulties. So I don't think
you've established your case that the use of self- and other-modifying
Rules must of necessity dramatically increase the chances of an
unchecked error cascade. What you have established is that feedback
loops are to be avoided.

OK, but that's just a special case of the general argument for
Pragmatism. One doesn't say "At the beginning of the week, every Player
receives a VT from the Bank"; one says "As soon as possible after the
beginning of the week, the Chancellor shall pay out a VT to every
Player." In fact, the Virus was one of the earliest examples of the
application of Pragmatic principles to Rule-design. It didn't say "At
the beginning of the week, a random Rule is amended in such-and-such a
way."; it said "Once each week, the Rulekeepor selects a Rule at
random and amends it in such-and-such a way." And we never had any
problems with the Virus.

Of course we all know that this is precisely what happened with the
adoption of Pragmatic Currencies. No-one could disagree that this
episode exposed a flaw in the system when dealing with errors in
announcing the results of Proposals. But the connection between this
episode and your argument against self-modifying and other-modifying
Rules escapes me.

A massive overhaul such as yours is not necessary to rectify
that situation, however.

Actually, I believe we have had cases where reported viral infections
turned out not to have happened because the Rulekeepor was mistaken as
to the number of Rules in the Ruleset.  Even if this actually never
happened, it was a possibility.

It is my opinion that every instance in which one might want to use a
self-modifying or other-modifying rule falls into one of three
categories:

1. sunset by self-repeal or temporary measure by self-amendment, which
   can be equally achieved without self-amendment using cut-on and
   cut-off dates;
2. modification upon proper player action, which can be achieved by
   directly authorizing the player to change the rules (making the
   change a player-caused rule change, something I have no problem
   with); and
3. unsafe automatic changes which either inherently lead to cascade
   errors, or at least prone to them.

Since the only desirable circumstances are (1) and (2), and both can
be achieved without using self-modifying Rules, I see no need for
them, and since prohibiting them protects from the undesirable

I seem to recall that there were a few problems with the Virus, but
that they were not severe.  As I have previously noted, the incomplete
pragmatism of the Virus rule was such that a misapprehension as to the
number of Rules in the Ruleset would result in the Rulekeepor making
an erroneous Virus Report, possibly creating the mistaken impression
that a Rule had been infected as a result.  I am almost certain that
there have been a few times when the Rulekeepor was mistaken as to the
number of Rules in the Ruleset over the past two years.

The same conceptual changes I suggest will remedy both problems.
There is no direct connection.

Proto-Proposal
A Duty to Propose

[Comment: I've developed a procedure for dealing with Players who are On
Hold. I've tried to make the instructions to the Promotor as clear as I
can. Please bring any problems to my attention.]

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "A Duty to Propose", be
created with the following text:

      Active Players not in their Grace Periods (henceforth in this
      Rule, 'Experienced Players') shall periodically incur a duty to
      submit a Proposal, as described in this Rule.

      The Promotor shall maintain an alphabetically sorted list of all
      Players. As soon as possible after the beginning of the Week, the
      Promotor shall perform the following procedure, which accomplishes
      the selection of the two Experienced Players to incur the duty to
      propose for that Week, the announcement of the names of those
      Players, and the updating of the list:

      (a) Experienced Players with an 'H' next to their names shall be
      selected before other Experienced Players. If there are more than
      two such Players, then the Promotor shall select the two highest
      on the list.
      
      (b) If, after selecting Experienced Players with an 'H' next to
      their names, there remain any places to be filled to bring the
      total number of Players selected for that Week to two, then the
      Promotor shall select the Experienced Player(s) highest on the list
      who do not have an asterisk ('*') next to their names. If there
      are not enough such Players, then only one Player is selected is
      selected for that Week.

      (c) The Promotor shall then announce in the Public Forum the names
      of the Players who have been selected for that Week. These Players
      have two weeks from the time of the Promotor's announcement to
      submit a Proposal. 

      (d) The Promotor shall then place an asterisk ('*') next to the
      names of the Players selected for that Week. If any of these
      Players had an 'H' next to their names, it shall be removed. 

      (e) If after step (d) is performed, it is the case that all
      Experienced Players have an asterisk next to their names, then the
      Promotor shall place an 'H' next to the name of any Player who is
      On Hold and who does not have an asterisk next to eir name, and
      remove all asterisks from the list.

      As stated above, the two Experienced Players selected by the
      Promotor each incur a duty to submit a Proposal within two weeks
      of the Promotor's announcement. Failure to do so is the Infraction
      of Failure to Propose, incurring a penalty of 1 Blot and 1 P-Note,
      to be detected and reported by the Promotor. The requirement to
      submit a Proposal placed upon a Player by this Rule lapses when
      the Player submits a Proposal, or when two weeks have elapsed from
      the time of the Promotor's announcement, whichever comes first.

####

It might be worth working an example thourgh to see how the above
procedure operates.

Initially, the list of Players will have the form: 

(A) (B) (C) (D) (E)

Let's say A is On Hold and C is a new Player, still in eir Grace Period.
Since neither A nor C are Experienced Players, according to the
definition, and since initially no Players have an 'H' next to their
names, the first Players to incur the duty to propose will be B and D.
After step (d), then, the list will look like this: 

(A) (B *) (C) (D *) (E)

In Week 2, A and C remain as before. So in step (b), there will not be
two Players to select. In this case, only E is selected for Week two.
After step (d), the list looks like this:

(A) (B *) (C) (D *) (E *)

Since it is now the case that every Experienced Player has an asterisk
next to their name, the condition in step (e) is met, and the list
becomes:

(A H) (B) (C) (D) (E)

In Week 3, A and C remain as before. As in Week 1, B and D are selected,
leaving us with:

(A H) (B *) (C) (D *) (E)

In Week 4, A comes Off Hold and C's Grace Period has concluded, while B
and E go On Hold. A and C are selected; after step (d) we have:

(A *) (B *) (C *) (D *) (E)

from which we can see that all Experienced Players once again have an
asterisk next to their names. After step (e), we have:

(A) (B) (C) (D) (E H)

Finally, in Week 5, E comes Off Hold, so A and E are selected, leaving
us with:

(A *) (B) (C) (D) (E *)

We can see that E did not succeed in avoiding eir turn by going On Hold
briefly. Also, the system picked up the fact that B had already had
their turn before going On Hold, and did not place an 'H' next to eir
name.

Doesn't 1442 already have that bug then? It says: 

      ....the Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity a
      number of Voting Tokens equal to the votes cast on that
      Proposal by that entity multiplied by the voting cost for
      that Proposal.

Not "each Voting Entity that votes", but "each Voting Entity". Thus
anyone who didn't vote should be billed from 0 VTs.

R1774 should be working. R106 was the problem, but it has since been 
amended.

Unfortunately, the LAN people here are going to be doing some major upgrades
this weekend.  As a result, starting at 5PM EST today, I will not have access
to e-mail until next Tuesday morning.  I doubt if it matters, but I thought I'd
let y'all know.  I'll have the Herald's Report ready on Tuesday.  Have a good
weekend, everyone.

This is a reminder to Players that on Mon, 12 Oct 12:03:24 GMT, R1859
(Secret Voting) will repeal itself, and the suppression clause will
delete itself from R1764 (Public Voting). At that moment, voting in the
Public Forum will cease to be illegal and resume being required (in the
sense that votes not sent to the PF will not be effective). Players
should adjust their behaviour accordingly.

It's probably also worth noting that all Active Players likely have a
duty to vote on one of P3794-3795. It's a little difficult to be certain
without an up-to-date Accountor's Report, but I do know that there are
plenty of VTs in circulation. According to the last Report (Sep 9), the
only Player too poor to vote would have been Blob, and he has received a
month's Salaries for two Offices since then.
