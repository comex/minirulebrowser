I'm not sure I understand what you mean by a "conditional utterance".
If you mean that a Player may utter something conditionally, I deny
that such a thing exists.  If you mean that a Player may utter
something which contains a condition, I will admit that such is
possible, but that the existence of the condition makes the utterance
such that the Rules should not give it meaning (unless the Rules allow
such utterances to be made such that they contain conditions).

I've been thinking about this, and the best solution I can think of is
massive deregulation: rather than dictating each nut and bolt, leave
most of the details to the discretion of the Recordkeepor, and let the
Courts resolve improprieties.

Protoproposal Chaos46 [rev. 3]

Appeal Tweaks

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1570 be amended to read:

      (a) As soon as possible after an Application for Appeal of a 
          Judgement or Motion has been executed, the Clerk of the
          Court shall:
          (1) assign, according to the procedures defined elsewhere,
              three Players to serve as the Board of Appeal for that
              Appeal; and 
          (2) publish a Notice of Appeal identifying the Judgement or
              Motion being Appealed, and the identity of the three
              Players selected under subparagraph (1) above.

      (b) The Clerk of the Courts shall develop and utilize a system
          of numbering or otherwise identifying Calls for Appeals such
          that Players may readily and unambiguously refer to any
          individual Appeal without undue difficulty or confusion.

      (c) If the Clerk of the Courts is in doubt as to whether an
          Application for Appeal has been successfully executed, e
          shall proceed as if it had been successfully executed,
          reserving the question of successful execution to the Board
          of Appeals.

      (d) If the Board of Appeals finds that the Application for
          Appeal which led to the appointment of that Board was not
          successfully executed, it may (at its discretion) dismiss
          the Appeal, without making any ruling on the merits of the
          Appeal.  A dismissal of this nature is without prejudice.

Nobody gets them.  Rule 1753 states that Proposals submitted under its
authority are deemed to have been submitted by the Repeal-O-Matic;
since the Repeal-O-Matic is not a Player, it cannot receive the Rule
833 bonus.

By my count, the vote on P3797 is now 4-3, meaning that the Proposal
will fail unless two more votes are cast for it before the VP finishes
in about 40 minutes.

If you want P3797 (On Hold for a Week) to pass, now's the time to act.

I should add that the purpose of the Proposal is to prevent Players from
manipulating their Activity status for personal gain.

Should the Zeitgeist rule also be modified, or should that be for 
players only?

I made it perfectly clear in my post what kind of utterance I meant by a
"conditional utterance": 'I hereby transfer 1 VT to fulfil my promise to
Jack, if I have not already done so.' is an example. So clearly we're
talking about the uttering of conditionals and nothing else. You assert
of such utterances that the Rules 'should not' give them meaning, but
provide no argument. Why shouldn't the Rules give them meaning?

Here's an argument for the opposite conclusion, one which I don't
necessarily endorse, but which I give here for the purposes of
stimulating debate: the Rules historically have, and currently still do,
give force to many different kinds of conditional utterances, and this
practice in most cases has proved to be at worst harmless, and possibly
even beneficial, provided that the conditions are ones such that the
Recordkeepor may easily and instantaneously ascertain of them whether
they hold. (That is, the RK doesn't have to keep a running record of
conditions which have been imposed, and constantly check to see if any
of them have been met.)
