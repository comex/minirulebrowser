> Proposal 3638 (Michael)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
> Repeal the Virus.

Ah, interesting. The end of the VP on that Proposal
is nearing; on the other hand, a few Players haven't
Voted yet. That's where Public Voting is really making
sense; by my tally, the Proposal will pass 8-6. I could
vote twice AGAINST, thus insuring that it will fail,
assuming of course none of the Players who haven't
Voted yet manifest a last-minute interest in supporting
it. Or I could vote twice FOR, making it quite likely
that it will pass even should some late Votes come in.

Bribes, anyone ?

I think two things need to be done so that messy situations like the
current one don't recur. 

(This reform programme does not even assume the repeal of such banes of
my life as the FM and the Virus, but should insulate us a bit better.)

1. Automatic ratification of undisputed official reports within a
   week. 

2. The Assessor should bill (issue POs) players for votes cast at the
   end of a proposal's voting period.  Then the Assessor doesn't need
   to be privileged with respect to maintaining VT records, and this
   job can be given to someone else.

Michael.

What about a first step towards simplifying the game, so we can spend
our time with creative play and politicking instead of bookkeeping,
tracking who is a voter and who isn't, changing our minds again and
again regarding which proposals were adopted and what our rules are at
the moment?

Seriously, I think that putting fun bits like the Virus, the FM (and
P-notes, I'll repropose their abolition) in the Agora history books,
at least for the time being, will make the game more playable and more
focused on what a nomic is about. At the moment, at least certain
officers seem to spend most of their time digging through their
records again and again... I'm glad I'm ot one of them.

Practically all of my available Nomic time in the last few months has
been spent on Assessorship duties.  (Neither the Chancellor nor the
Wizard are particularily tedious.)

Jeff's Votes, which appeared just after I sent this, make it 11-6.
Supporters of the Virus have some work ahead of them - and I'm still 
bribable. ;)
