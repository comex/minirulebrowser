Well, it will probably do no harm, but I also can't see that it will do
much good. Anyone who wants to use the service will simply be shifting
their own responsibility to keep track who holds which Offices onto you.
Personally, I'd want to be paid for doing work like that. And it won't
solve the problem which sparked this whole discussion, that of the case
where Players are systematically mistaken about who holds an Office due
misunderstanding of the Rules, since you are no less likely than anyone
else to make such mistakes. There isn't much we can do to solve such
problems, apart from moving to an extremely pragmatic framework for
Officer Transition, one in which its seeming to be the case that an
Office is Delegated, for example, actually makes it the case that the
Office is Delegated, even if the Delegation is somehow improper. But
such an approach brings obvious problems in its train. (For example, how
do we define the circumstances under which we want to say that it seems
to be the case that an Office is Delegated? And how do we make this
definition tight enough to disallow abuse?)

I'm interested in hearing the candidate's positions.  A few
questions towards specific offices:

Chancellor candidates: What is your feeling about the proper level/role
of the BOS?  If plots were "fixed" while keeping their current levels
of production--even if we were assured that the situation were
temporary, until a flexible production system could be put into
place--would you be willing to enact a temporary increase in the BOS,
in order to keep holding office economically competitive with owning
Plots?

Commander-in-Chief candidates: Why should we have this office at all? 1/2 :)

Justiciar candidates: please describe your feelings about the
various standards listed in R217.

Sorry, I don't have any office-specific questions for Notary or
Wizard.  Perhaps you can come up with your own. :)

Also, for those of you running for more than one office, I'd be
interested to hear which you would want most, as I tend to
believe in distributing offices among as many players as
possible.  (Although this will not be an absolute criterion
in my voting.)

But if "some set of future CFJs" is limited and well-defined, game
custom allows this.

Except that R1681 didn't exist at the time, since the passage

Sounds like we really should have a CFJ to settle this, since I think I
lean toward the view that "all CFJs called in the next two weeks", for
example, does not name a 'a specific CFJ' as required by R1567. Hence my
view is that to the extent that prior game custom has allowed this, it
has done so in violation of the Rules.

A delayed TO can be vacated if it's still delayed (Rule 1799).

Unless we rule that anything sent to registrar@agora.nomic.org has entered
the Registrar's normal technical domain of control, even if (due to abnormal
circumstances) we are all temporarily mistaken as to the Registrar's
identity.

You've never been Speaker before, have you Murphy? It's a nice job - if

An interesting paradox now arises concerning Harlequin's eligibility to
Judge this CFJ. I should have barred him, but I forgot. Still, since I
did forget, I almost hope he gets selected, just to see what happens. We
haven't had a decent paradox of self-reference around here for ages. Of
course, Michael might not include him among the list of eligible
Players, an action which could turn out in retrospect to have been
illegal, if the CFJ is Judged TRUE.

Ahh... I thought it might have been, but I seemed to recall a recent

That's an interesting question which brings to mind how I originally got the
name Macross.  Years ago, a friend of mine had an account on a local BBS for
which he had paid a small sum.  For some reason (I don't recall exactly
why), he was unable to continue making use of the account and since I wanted
an account on the system, I hacked his password and 'acquired' his
account(something I would never do now, but at the time we were just kids).
The system had just prior to this established a (very primitive) gateway to
the Internet and he had had the opportunity to choose a name for use on the
Internet.  He chose Macross (which he tells me rhymes with lacrosse) and to
my dismay the sysop would not allow a change to the name.  Well, it turns
out that I maintained that account for quite a few years(imagine actually
paying for access! :) ) and got used to being macross@thatsystem.com (name
changed to protect the innocent or the guilty as the case may be!) and
decided when I switched to TIAC as my main internet access to be
macross@tiac.net.  I'll have to ask him how he ever arrived at that name.

-Macross

True, but in that case the Recordkeepor will not yet have recorded a transfer
pursuant to that TO, so R1818 still won't be invoked.

Ah, right.  In that case, all of those POs are still outstanding and it is my
unfortunate duty to report that Chuck is guilty of Persistent Indebtedness for
Indulgences and order em to pay one Indulgence to the Bank.

H. Scorekeepor, note that Chuck loses 2 points as a result of the above Blot.

Chuck,

Now that it has been reported, why didn't you just go ahead and vacate them
again?

Upon request, here is a little speel that I hope will convince you
that I am a good candidate for the Chancellor's job.

1.  Basic competency:  Having done the job roughly since the New Year,
    I am able to perform the job responsibly.  

2.  Policy: as an Office-holder myself, I believe that the BOS should
    be set to a level that rewards Office-holding and goes some way
    towards compensating Players for the real-life they put into the
    game's various jobs.   On the other hand, if and when the Plots
    economy gets off the ground, I won't ignore the Cartographor, and
    I'll aim to work with that Officer to ensure a balanced supply of
    VTs into the economy.  (Obviously the Cartographor potentially
    has control over more than just the VTs, but the Chancellor
    doesn't.) 

Finally, though I'm sure Blob would do a fine job as Chancellor, I
also think it is probably a good idea to have the Chancellor not be
the same person as a Currency recordkeepor. 

Michael.

Not surprisingly I agree with Steve fully and urge the Judge to return a
Judgement of True.

That's exactly it--I was waiting for this week's Persistent Indebtedness
penalty. :)  Vacation will follow later today.
