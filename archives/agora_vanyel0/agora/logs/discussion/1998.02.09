I like it.  I didn't catch anything obviously wrong with it either.
However, it is an idea that has also made its way into Scott's Omnibus
Reform bill.  There he introduces a special penalty for voting and
then failing to pay one's account: losing one's right to vote for some
number of weeks.  I think this might be a nice addition to your proto
as well. 

Given its simplicity (even with the addition above, I think it would
be simple), I'm keen to see this proposed soon.  

Michael.

I like this. One remark, though:

Rarely used, yes. But white elephant? Or, to put it more bluntly, what
are groups good for if not for unity votes? I would suggest making the
repeal of 1653 an extra proposal. Anyone for a general discussion of
what groups and contests are good for?

Nowt. 

I think we should get rid of Groups and Contests as they're not being
used.  Talk about a dusty corner of the ruleset.  

If we got rid of corporate entities entirely, we could then be rid of
the Probate Code (yay!), but I did think of a (perhaps not entirely
serious) use for SLCs over the weekend.  I think we should move into
an expansionary phase of development and attept to "take over" other
(newish) nomics by offering them a home in Agora, with their existing
rulesets as SLCs.  With a bit of luck both games might gain new
Players, and the interaction of different cultures might be quite
interesting.

Kolja is just the man to do this of course, as he is Ambassador.  Does
he think there are any suitable victim nomics out there?  

I really like the idea of a super-nomic that has a lot more players.
How do we turn Agora into such a nomic?  Perhaps Internomic could
become the umbrella nomic for us all, but it will have to start doing
a lot more in terms of impacting Agora if it's to be really
interesting. 

The problem with Internomic as it stands, is that it seems to be
conducted as an entirely separate game.  We need to give it some teeth
so that it actually compels members to do something within themselves.
As it is, all we're doing at the moment is playing in another,
slower-paced, teethless game as a gestalt entity.

More of a discussion on Internomic than Groups, but hey,
Michael.

I won't comment on Groups, but I believe contests are good for
implementing game-like features which players might otherwise
be tempted to try out in the Rules themselves.  For example,
if I wanted to run a chess tounament within Agora, I feel it
would be better to set that up as a Contest rather
than create new Rules to run it within Agora.  OK, so
Contests can't award Currencies out of thin air like Agora can,
but I see that as a feature, not a bug.  Otherwise you are unfairly
devaluing the Currencies of those who aren't interested in participating
in the tournament.  Also FENICS exists to help provide incentives for
such Contests.

So any time people want to set up sub-games, they have to enact
it in the Rules?  No thanks.

Well, I'm not much at making speeches, but I would like to
say that I consider it quite an honor to be named Rulekeepor
in Perpetuity, and I will endeavour to always be faithful to my
duties and the trust which the Agoran community has placed in me.

Things like lines of "=3D" repeated to separate proposals, and

My reader doesn't think it was MIME-encoded, but gecko did because it
did some sort of auto-conversion on the message as it passed through.
I received it as an 8-bit message, complete with a funny accent over
one of the Es of FETED in Jester's proposal.  (Examine the headers on
your message to see what has been done to it.)

Steve, I think auto-conversion should be turned off at gecko if this
can be managed.  Something between it and Chuck is mangling his
message when it is sent a la 8 bits, and this is precisely why MIME
should be used.  It is out of line for a component in the mail
distribution system to alter the content of what is passing through it
in a misguided attempt to make people's lives easier.  Of course,
Chuck should also get a MIME aware mail reader, if he doesn't already
have one. 

Michael.

And when was the last time someone set up a sub-game that anyone else
wanted to play?  Anyway, people can now use the protection of Agoran
Contract Law (R1742) to play these games if they really do start to
happen.  In fact ACL can be used to replace SLCs entirely it seems to
me.  Or have I missed something?

Hmm.  Strange, it's just a text file that I copy into Groupwise and send.  I
don't know where the special characters are coming from.  Most of what you
describe seems to be connected to the equal signs in the text.  Does this - "="
- look bad too?  Also, is this new or has this been happening all along (I
didn't do anything different this week from other weeks)?

-- Crito

I just had a thought.  It may be some strange formatting characters got slipped
in from one of the proposals whose text I cut and pasted into my text file. 
Unfortunately, if that's the case, I can't tell there is a problem until you
complain about it.  8(

Aha!  So it *was* a special character that I cut from a proposal that caused
the problem.  I remember seeing that accent myself, but since my mailer didn't
complain, I didn't give it a second thought.

No, you haven't.  While I didn't directly intend Rule 1742 to replace
Groups and Contests, I see only one reason why it cannot: a collective
enterprise under Rule 1742 is not a game entity in the sense that a
Group or Contest is, which means that it cannot have an Executor, nor
can it possess entities independently in the manner that Groups or
Contests do.  (In a way, enterprises organized under Rule 1742 are
more akin to partnerships, while Groups and Contests are more akin to
corporations.)

Um, I believe it _was_ sent as MIME Q-P, and gecko converted it to 8-bit
for some but not all of us (presumably those who are on 8bitMIME-aware
ESMTP mail servers.)

Of course, conversion the other way will happen when an 8bitMIME message
is passed on to a non-aware server, as I believe is demanded by the
standard.

I'm not clear what you mean by offering them a "home".  Do you mean
that they will given a mailing list at gecko?  Or that they will
conduct their business as usual by themselves and give a weekly report
to Agora?  I'm not sure I see why any nomic would do the latter, but
I'm sure several would be happy to go along with it for the former.

If you mean expanding Agora, posting to various newsgroups and the
bulletin board might get a few, especially if some extra bonus was
given to people to register (more VT's, etc).  Another idea, though
I'm not sure how successful this would be, would be to give current
Agora players a bonus for each player that they get to
register/re-register.

When I read the InterNomic web pages a few weeks ago, I was struck by
the similarity to the problems of Confederacy and Federal Government
that the early United States went through...

Just one question: how can anyone really expect to Win this way? Not
because it's necessarily impossible to amend the Rule, but because I don't
see any real reason why anyone would vote FOR a Proposal that attempted to
amend the Rule.

  Looking over the various reports that flooded my mailbox today, a
few thoughts came to mind that I thought I'd share.  Flame away. ;)

 1.) General Chaos was fined 4 VT's for not filing his Official
     Reports in time, but yet was given 2 VT's for filling in those
     same positions.  Doesn't it seem that an Officer who fails to
     report should not only be penalized but not be paid for that
     week?

 2.) Seeing that the Distributor was given 1 VT (quite rightly), I
     was wondering if we could consider giving Murphy 1 VT for his
     ever helpful weekly digest?

 3.) A small request for the Promotor: could reports about new
     Proposals contain the official time that the Voting Period
     on said Proposals will end?  I realize it can be calculated,
     but it might be easier for record keeping if it was listed
     with each batch (since several batches are active at any
     given time).

Well, that's about it.  As usual, Monday was the most exciting Agora
day for me.  Thanks to all the officers that sent out reports.

Well, the official *time* is a little tricky, since it depends on when the
message hits the PF and I don't know what that will be when I hit the "send"
key.  I will start putting the official *date* in the message and you can look
at the header to get the actual time.

Well, actually it can't, at least in the message containing the
Proposals.  The Promotor won't know the effective time of the
distribution until the message comes back to him.

According to my unoffical annotation of R478, from CFJ 707,
the effective time of a message to the PF is the time the
message is received by the listserver.  (Which doesn't take
into account that PF messages need not be sent via listserv, but
that's a different issue.)

I don't know if you're trying to be argumentative or not; clearly I
meant the same sort of dispensation that the Distributor gets.

I believe that we have ignored that annotation lately, after Scott(?) put
forward arguments against it.

For example, Scott counted my recent Votes that were sent before the end
of the Voting Period but held up at NVG's mail server.

We just changed this; the reason being that some Offices, notably the
Assessor, have substantial duties beyond their defined Official
Reports.

Neither the Promotor nor anyone else can know when the VP of a
Proposal ends until the Proposal has been distributed.  It would
require prescience for the Promotor to include this information along
with the distribution of new Proposals.

It should be noted that I do not agree with that interpretation, nor

Aha. So you don't appreciate it enough to spend your own VTs on it, but
rather you want us all to pay (by a decrease in relative wealth) in order
to sponsor something you enjoy. 

Don't worry, I'm just stirring. I wouldn't support your proposal, not 
because I do not value Murphy's reports, but because I do not support 
government sponsorship of this service using public funds. In fact, if
Murphy is interested in being paid, I would encourage em to charge some
kind of fee for his services. I would not be willing to pay as much as
1 VT a week, but for, say, 2 months subscription, I would be more 
interested.

All in all, I want to encourage private enterprise. For too long we 
have been paying people out of public funds under the illusion that we
can just go on minting more and more money, without any effect on our
economy. It just won't work. It's time for a user-pays system.

That's not it at all.  

First, I don't appreciate the implication that I am cheap.  I won't dwell

Secondly, I'm not sure I see your point about "a decrease in relative 
wealth".  Would you suggest that we shouldn't pay our Officers for
their work?  Should we restrict new players so as not to distribute the
5 VT's they receive?  Maybe we shouldn't pay Winners 10 VT's?  Of
course we should do all three of those, because we're getting
something in return for the money that the Bank is minting and paying
out.  I was just suggesting that we reward another service, when
so many other ones are getting payment.

I can't tell if you mean that as comforting or as a threat (which may
say something about its effectiveness).

That's a fine idea, but I don't see why you chose to jump down my
throat when I made a suggestion very much in line with precedent.

It's probably some such objection that resulted in my not proposing this
when first I thought of it two years ago. Still, one might regard it as
a test of political skill...

By a stragne coincidence, I had exactly the same idea last night.
I'll think about adding it to the proto, although I may decide to
handle it later in a separate Proposal.

I should read Scott's Omnibus Reform Proposal. I've tried several
times already, but the document is not configured for easy reading.
I wish it were divided into sections, with a short explanation of
what each section aims to do. As it is, I find myself getting lost,
unable to keep track of what the overall effect of the Proposal
would be.

Right. If Groups were reconstituted as collective enterprises, we
would lose our ability to treat them as corporate persons, with
the right to vote etc. It is true that Groups haven't been a big
influence of late, but I'm against getting rid of them.

I am trying to be argumentative. :)  I suspected that's what
you meant, but I wanted to be sure (as well as make a point).
The distributor performs a function, maintaining the mailing
lists, which is vital, or nearly so, to the game--it would be
much more difficult to play without it.  Murphy's weekly
digests are nice to have, but I don't put them in the same
category as the existence of the mailing lists--it wouldn't
be much more difficult to play without them.  If you want
to reward him personally, by all means, go ahead; but I
don't think this is deserving of receiving an award from
the Bank.

If you must give him something from the Bank, give him responsibility
along with the award: make the position on Office with a report,
thus penalizing him if he doesn't produce one.

In my view, the ability of groups to cast votes is sufficient reason
for them to exist, and sufficient incentive to be in one.

There's nothing in the list configuration file that suggests to me that
I have the power to turn auto-conversion off. Perhaps it's happening
higher up in the mail system? I'll ask Geoff.

If you could provide me with CFJ 707, as well as a suggested

I've made a minor change to allow the Assessor to issue a single PO
for 5 VTs (if a Voting Entity has cast 5 votes on several different
Proposals), instead of forcing em to execute 5 POs for 1 VT each.

I'm still thinking about how to formulate the special penalties for
failing to satisfy POs resulting from voting.

####
Proto-Proposal
Split the Assessor's functions

[Comment: a proto to split the two functions of the Assessor - tallying
votes and VT Recordkeeping - into two separate Offices. The major change
that this entails is to the way voting is handled. I've tried to keep
things as simple as possible, by loosening the link between voting and
spending VTs. Under the system I propose, voting results in being billed
for VTs, but voting is not a dual act of both casting a vote, and 
spending VTs accordingly. Compare my proposed R1442 to the current
version to see the advantages of this approach.] 

This Proposal has an AI of 2.

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "The Accountor", be created
with the following text:

      There is an Office of Accountor, whose Salary is 1.5 times the
      Basic Officer Salary, and whose responsibility it is to be the 
      Recordkeepor for Voting Tokens. The Accountor's Report includes
      the number of Voting Tokens possessed by each entity which
      possesses them, and any changes thereto since the last posting
      of the Accountor's Report.

Be it further resolved that the Office of Accountor shall initially
be held by the Assessor.

Be it further resolved that R1449 (The Assessor) be amended by replacing
the text "3 times the Basic Officer Salary" with the text "1.5 times the
Basic Officer Salary".

Be it further resolved that R1696 (Voting Tokens) be amended to read:

      Voting Tokens (VTs) are a Currency.  The MUQ of VTs is 0.1.
      The Recordkeepor for VTs is the Accountor.  The Mintor of
      VTs is the Bank.

Be it further resolved that R1442 (Using VTs) have its Title changed
to 'Voting and Voting Tokens', and that it be amended to read:

      A Voting Entity votes upon a Proposal when, during the Voting 
      Period of that Proposal, e informs the Assessor of the vote or 
      votes e is casting upon that Proposal, provided that e is 
      authorized to vote on that Proposal. A Voting Entity may inform the 
      Assessor that e casts no votes on a Proposal, and doing so cancels 
      any votes e has previously cast on that Proposal, if this is done 
      during the Voting Period of that Proposal. Cancelled votes are not 
      counted by the Assessor and do not count towards Quorum.

      As soon as possible after the end of the Voting Period of a
      Proposal, the Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity one Voting
      Token for each uncancelled vote cast by that Voting Entity on
      that Proposal. In the case where a Voting Entity has cast more
      than one vote on a Proposal, or a Voting Entity has cast votes
      on more than one Proposal, the results of which the Assessor
      has published at the same time, the Assessor is permitted to
      bill the Voting Entity for an amount of Voting Tokens
      equivalent to all the uncancelled votes cast by the Voting
      Entity on those Proposals, instead of billing the Voting Entity
      once for each uncancelled vote e cast.

Be it further resolved that R1731 (Implicit Transfer Orders) be repealed.

[Comment: no longer needed.]

Be it further resolved that R206 (Voting Entities and Votes) be amended 
by deleting from it the text:

      The casting of any votes may only be achieved by the casting of 
      Voting Tokens, as specified in other Rules.

Be it further resolved that R1717 (The Senate) be amended by replacing
the text in which currently reads:

      If any Entity other than a Senator has already Voted on a
      Proposal by the time it becomes a Senate Proposal, their Votes
      on that Proposal change to ABSTAIN, and cannot change
      thereafter, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, and at the
      end of the Voting Period, the cost of casting those Votes is
      transferred to them.

with text which reads:

      If an Entity other than a Senator has already voted on a
      Proposal by the time it becomes a Senate Proposal, eir votes
      on that Proposal are cancelled.

Be it further resolved that R1653 (Groups and Unity Vote) be repealed.

[Comment: a rarely used white elephant not worth saving.]

It means that I am opposing you for the interests of debate. I don't have
anything personal against you. I don't think you are cheap. I just wanted
to start up a bit of an argument about the relative merits of public
funding vs user-pays. I'm sorry if you felt that I was jumping down 
your throat. It was just political rhetoric. I'm afraid you're going to
have to get used to it. There's a lot of it around here, and you have to
develop a thick skin to survive. Even so, it was perhaps wrong of me to 
be so abrupt with a newcomer. I'll issue an appropriate Kudo Transfer, 
as an apology.

I agree with Blob here.  Anyway, if Murphy gets a VT for his
summaries, I want a couple for my Web-based Rulesets,
especially the CRLs.  (I consider them in the same category:
nice to have, but not too difficult to play without, and
thus not deserving, IMO, of government sponsorship.)

H. Assessor General Chaos,

My votes on Proposals 3688-3691 are as follows:

 3  3  3  3
 6  6  6  6
 8  8  9  9
 8  9  0  1

 A

Notes:

3688: I think Silliness is just barely worth saving for the fun it
      occasionally affords us. I'd be in favour of beefing it up a
      little so that we saw more Silly Proposals, say by getting the
      Speaker to randomly select a Silly Player each week.

3689: A tricky decision, demonstrating the forces at work in a VT
      scarce environment. Is it worth voting AGAINST? Morendil is
      probably hoping that enough Players will simply declare
      Presence, allowing him to squeak this one through with just
      a few votes FOR. I urge other Players not to vote at all
      on this.

3690: I'm not worried about this passing, since it probably won't
      have any effects if it does.

3691: If this passes, we'll lose R1586. I'm hoping it'll fail Quorum.

Currently 3, due to R955 being amended. If drop that, it goes back to 2.

Proposal 3683 already proposes to repeal R1763.

That's a bit generous, don't you think? Not only is e being let off,
but now e cannot be penalized for further failures to satisfy POs.
Under my proposed voting system in "Split the Assessor's functions",
this might mean free voting for three months. Yippee!
