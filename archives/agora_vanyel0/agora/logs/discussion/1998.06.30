You're ignoring the last part of 1583, "which is a positive
multiple of that Currency's MUQ."  If 1583 simply said
"a number of units of that Currency," period, you would be
right.  But it doesn't.

I agree with Crito here, that the normal usage of "multiple" is
"integral multiple."  We don't normally say that five is a multiple
of two.

I think I have to agree with Chuck and hold that your proposed

Protoproposal Chaos33 [rev. 4]

The Industrial Revolution

Be it therefore resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      Certain entities, or classes of entities, may be designated as
      Possessions by the Rules.

      Every entity which is designated as a Possession has an Owner.
      If no other record exists of the Owner of a given Possession,
      its Owner is the Bank.

      Any entity which possesses any Possession, but which does not
      have an Executor nor is already in Probate, shall be placed in
      Probate.

      The Owner of a Possession may transfer the Ownership of that
      Possession to any other entity capable of owning Plots by
      sending a message to the Officer responsible for maintaining the
      record of Ownership of that Possession.  The message shall
      unambiguously identify the Possession to be transferred and the
      entity who is to receive ownership of that Possession.  The
      change of ownership is effective at the time the message is
      sent, unless the message specifies a later time.

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 896 be amended by deleting the
paragraph reading "When a Player registers, eir Location is the
Welcoming Center." 

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1016 be amended by replacing
"Moves to the Stasis Chamber" with "announces that e does so in the
Public Forum", and by replacing "Moves from the Stasis Chamber" with
"announces that e does so in the Public Forum".

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1664 be amended by deleting the
words "whose Location is the Beer Hall".

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1711 be amended to read,

      A Degree that has been Granted becomes awarded when the
      recipient notifies the Speaker (or eir Delegate, as described
      below) that e accepts the Degree.

      When a Degree is Granted to a recipient who is not a Player, the
      Speaker shall promptly inform the recipient that e has been
      Granted the degree by some means which has a reasonable
      likelihood of reaching the recipient.  The Speaker may Delegate
      this duty to any other willing Player.

Be it further resolved, that Rules 1706, 1707, 1708, and 1709 be
repealed, and further that any and all Locations still remaining in
existence are destroyed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1710 be amended to read,

      There shall exist the Office of Cartographor.  The Cartographor
      shall retain the records of Ownership of Plots and of Factories.

      The Official Report of the Cartographor shall contain:
      * the Location and Ownership of every Plot
      * the Placement and Ownership of every Factory

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      A Location is an ordered pair of integers.  The first of these
      two integers is the Longitude of that Location, and the second
      is the Latitude.  No Longitude may be less than the Minimum
      Longitude nor greater than the Maximum Longitude.  No Latitude
      may be less than the Minimum Latitude nor greater than the
      Maximum Latitude.  Initially, the Minimum Longitude and Minimum
      Latitude are both 0, and the Maximum Longitude and Maximum
      Latitude are both 10.  Any of these may be changed
      (independently of the others) by the action of any Instrument of
      Power 1 or greater, or by the Cartographor Without Objection,
      but in no case may the Minimum Longitude be greater than the
      Maximum Longitude, nor may the Minimum Latitude be greater than
      the Maximum Latitude.

      For each possible Location (as detailed above) there exists
      exactly one Plot.  Plots are Possessions.

      A Plot may contain Currencies.  For the purposes of the Rules, a
      Plot's Executor is the same as the Executor of its Owner.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      Factories are a class of entities which may be placed upon
      Plots.  At most one Factory may be placed upon a Plot, and every
      Factory is placed on at most one Plot.  The Plot upon which a
      Factory is placed is called its Placement.  

      The Owner of a Factory which is not placed upon a Plot may place
      it upon any Plot which does not already contain a Factory.  The
      Owner of a Factory which is placed upon a Plot may remove it
      from that Plot.  The Owner of a Plot may remove any Factory
      placed upon it.  All of these are accomplished by the Owner of
      the Factory (or the Plot, in the third case) by sending a
      message to the Cartographor unambiguously specifying what is to
      be done.

      Factories are Possessions.  

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      Each Factory is of a particular Design, and once created as a
      Factory of that Design cannot be changed to a Factory of another
      type.  

      Every Factory consumes and produces units of Currency according
      to its Design.  The Design for each Factory specifies an input
      of a positive number of units of a Currency, and an output of a
      non-negative number of units of a Currency (which need not be
      distinct from that of the input).

      At the beginning of each Nomic Week, if, in the Plot where a
      Factory is placed, there exist at least as many units of the
      input Currency as called for by that Factory's Design, and that
      Factory is Active, the Factory destroys that many units of the
      input Currency and creates the number of units of the output
      Currency as specified in the Design.  The units of Currency thus
      destroyed are taken from, and the units of Currency thus created
      are added to, the Plot in which the Factory is Placed.

      Any Factory which has, for the entire preceding Nomic Week, been
      Placed in the same Plot, is Active.  All other Factories are
      Idle.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      A Factory with a given Design may only be created by the Mintor
      of the Output Currency called for by that Design. 

      In order to create a Factory, the Mintor of the Output Currency
      called for in that Design must destroy 4 Ergs, specifying that e
      does in a message sent to both the Recordkeepor of Ergs and to
      the Cartographor.  This message must also specify for the
      Cartographor the Design of the Factory thus created.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      The following standard Factory Designs exist:

      Mine:   Input is 1 Erg, output is 3 Ergs.
      House:  Input is 1 Erg, output is 1 P-Note.
      Farm:   Input is 1 Erg, output is 1 VT.
      Church: Input is 1 Erg, output is 0 or more Indulgences, as
      specified elsewhere.

      The Bank may not create any Factory with a Design other than
      those given by this Rule.

      The Bank, upon the request of any entity who also successfully
      transfers 4 Ergs to the Bank for the purpose of making that
      request, shall create a Factory of any of these designs and
      shall transfer ownership of the Factory thus created to the
      entity thus requesting.

      In the construction or interpretation of the Rules, all words

This doesn't seem to account for terms which are redefined
within Agora.  Also, I would say this is probably unnecessary,
in that the sentiment is already incorporated into using commonsense
[sic] to interpret the Rules.

Personally, I'd rather see a Plot fix which was more true to
the original intent of the first Plot Proposal.

But there have been many examples of individuals appearing not to use
the commonsense interpretation of rules lately, the most recent being
Steve's proposed interpretation of "multiple".

I did not intend to proto that; I forgot that I had left that on the

Do you have any examples of the courts not using the commonsense
interpretation of a Rule?  And if people ignore R217, why would
they pay any more attention to your Rule?

Actually, it was just a mistake. I got distracted by the fact that
the word "number" actually does appear in R1596. But it's in the wrong
place for it to have the import I ascribed to it. Chuck's argument
that 5 is not a positive multiple of 2 has shown me the error of
my ways.

I therefore vacate the Payment Order I made for 0.5 Indulgences
naming Macross as Payor and the Bank as Payee. Any suggestions as
to what I should replace it with? A PO for 1 Indulgence?

I suppose that as penitence for my mistake, I shall have to suffer
the indignity of being used as the General's stalking horse with as
much grace as I am able to muster.

Here is the rule in its entirety. Only the first sentence is relevant.
--------------
Rule 214/0 (Mutable)

     All business to be conducted with a member nomic shall be conducted
      with the liaison to that nomic unless otherwise specified. No entity
     may be liaison to more than one member nomic. 
----------------

The way I read it doesn't say who can specify, so why not me?

Now one may counter argue that R216 paragraph 2 gives this power back to
the rules. In this case I'd argue as follows:
R214 allows me, or anyone, to 'specify otherwise'
R216 explicitly does not allow this.
This is a conflict that can be resolved by precedence, and since neither
rule claims precedne, the lower numbered rule takes precedence.

I was almost ready to throw in the towel on this one, but I thought about it
overnight.  You seem to be forgetting that integers are a subset of the real
numbers and are taking the phrase "number of units of that Currency" out of
context with the rest of the sentence.  "A number of units of that Currency
*which is a positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ*".  The rest of that
sentence restricts "number" in this case to the subset of real numbers that are
positive multiples of the Currency's MUQ.  It is true that "positive multiple"
is ambiguous in that it could mean any real or integral multiple, but the clear
definition of MUQ, indicating an indivisible unit of Currency, IMO resolves the
ambiguity in favor of integral multiples.  If I were to say to you, "I will
transfer you a number of Indulgences between one and three" you would
understand that to mean exactly one, two, or three Indulgences, precisely
because the MUQ of Indulgences restricts "number" in this case to "integer".

I'm afraid I am going to have to force you to make a CFJ if you want to insist
on your interpretation.  I will, of course, abide by the court's decision.

So, another batch of proposals distributed, and they'll fail quorum
again, I guess. 

In principle, I like the idea of increasing VT expenditure. But I am
afraid that at the moment we've overdone it a bit, and in my opinion
the straw that broke the camel's neck was the abolition of
presence. It was always possible to find three people who'd vote for
something. But now we need five, and we always have several players
who don't vote because a) they aren't allowed to (voting priviledge
blocked) b) they can't afford to c) they expect others to actively
convince them. These are all perfectly legitimate reasons, but
although I'm not in any of these groups I won't vote at the moment
becasue I fell it will be a waste of VTs, because proposals will fail
quorum anyway.

Kind of a dead end situation at the moment, although I can't find an
indiviual player or rule to blame for it.

I note that the order of these is incorrect.  The second and third proposals in
the queue should be swapped.

Hi all,

I've decided to go into indulgence trading. I'm offering up to 1.5 VT
for an indulgence. Any offers?

I'm afraid it's not - the recent tax levy included a PO with

I think a Judgement of FALSE is indicated. Macross can satisfy the PO

But the definition of TO dontains the same language as that of PO, so
neither POs nor TOs can even be made with such amounts.

That's what I always thought (and what 1577 is for). But with the
current definitions of PO and TO the elegant rounding provision of
1577 seems to lie around unused.

Actually, that no longer matters. Murphy is not a Contestant anymore.

Seeing as people generally appear to agree on this. How about I rewrite

Sounds good to me.  And you should probably make
the default time, for holding on to the parcel too
long, 24 hours or at least 12 hours.

The following are all the recent CFJs I have on record.  I may have
missed the CFJ you remember, but I don't recall it myself:

1099: Called by Macross, to be judged by Murphy
     (assigned on Mon, 29 Jun 1998 10:26:23 +0100)
  "It is not possible to satisfy a PO requiring the transfer of 0.5
   Indulgences."

1098: Called by Kolja A., judged FALSE by Oerjan
     (called on Mon, 15 Jun 1998 18:15:19 +0200)
  "Kolja A. has bought plot "Area 44"."

1097: Called by Macross, judged TRUE by Kolja A.
     (called on Fri, 29 May 1998 19:06:23 -0400)
  "Player Macross has issued an Order the text of which is:
     I hereby Order and command Player Swann to refrain from using
     words that are not spelled the same backwards as forwards when
     issuing any Administrative, Judicial, Appellate or Private Orders
     unless the issuing of those Orders is explicitly required of 'em
     by the Rules or by an Order issued by Player Macross."

1096: Called by Morendil, judged FALSE by Oerjan
     (called on Thu, 21 May 1998 17:23:42 +0100)
  "An Order, as defined in Rule 1793, and of whatever type, is "a
   Nomic Entity created in accordance with the Rules" in the sense of
   Rule 1513 and as such is subject to the limitations set forth in
   that Rule, and in particular that Orders derive coercive power from
   some Rules and that the Rules take precedence over Orders whenever
   an Order conflicts with a Rule."

1095: Called by Swann, judged FALSE by elJefe
     (called on Thu, 21 May 1998 09:26:31 -0400)
  "The orders issued by Swann in the message to the PF entitled "Here
  we go..." were legal and valid Orders."

1094: Called by Swann, judged TRUE by Steve
     (called on Wed, 20 May 1998 18:05:48 -0400)
  "The Orders issued by Player Swann in the message entitled 'Coup
  d'etat' were valid."

Michael.

Sigh. I feel it is probably my civic duty to vote on this, just so we don't
see yet another neccesary fix die because of lack of interest. I need to
know, though: am I currently allowed Voting Privledges?

The problem is not any one of the ideas but all of them at once. I was
strongly for instituting Presence in the first place, and I still feel it's
a useful tool to make sure VT scarcity doesn't eviscerate our Proposal
mechanism. Stepping up the minimum VT expenditure from 1 all the way to 5
was, IMHO, a very bad idea.

If two or more of the proposals in this week's batch fail Quorum, I will be
proposing to return Presence, and in addition I will pay a small token from
my meager holdings to each player who will vote FOR it.

Since the wording of my CFJ didn't result in the stay of the original PO, I
hereby transfer 0.5 Indulgences to the Bank to satisfy it.  I just want to
be covered in case it takes awhile for the Judgement.

Any attempt to bill me for 1 indulgence will result in an immediate CFJ.  If
you can find something for which I owe another 0.5 Indulgences you can do a
combined PO for both and I will not protest.

Let's see how this thing plays out, eh?

I will be out of town from Saturday morning, July 11, until Monday
July 20, while I attend the Australian Association of Philosophy
Conference. Can other Players inform me if they are prepared to
be Delegates for whatever Offices I may hold, if any, after the
Elections which have just been triggerred by the change of month
are concluded?

I hereby offer to offset half the cost of voting FOR P3765 (which
repeals R1766) to the first 3 Players to do so, ie 0.5 VTs, and it is
my hope that Crito will make a similar offer. The Voting Period ends
on Sat, 04 July 17:21:33 GMT.

Crito?
