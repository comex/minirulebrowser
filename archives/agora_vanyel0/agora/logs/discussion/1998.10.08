I meant "as applied to the definition of the Nomic Week", not
"in the definition of the Nomic Week", of course.

A little competition for places in the Queue, at last. Now if only we
had 15 or 20 Proposals in the Queue, we could have a Batch Size of 5 and
still have competition for places.

I can think of two different, perhaps complementary ways, to meet your
concerns. The first would be make sure that no Player is required to
produce a Proposal more than every-so-often: if we required two Players
per week to make a Proposal, and stuck to a fixed roster, then no
Player's turn would come around more often than once every 8 weeks,
which strikes me as plenty of time. And two extra Proposals per week
would be enough to make a significant difference to the Queue. The
second way would be to provide alternatives for those Players unable or
unwilling to contribute a Proposal.

What do you think?

Proto-Proposal
A Duty to Propose

[Comment: a very rough first draft. Comments and suggestions welcomed.
I've arranged the selection process so that Players have a pretty good
idea well in advance when their turn to propose is going to be, so they
will have plenty of time to think about it. I think this is better than
letting the Promotor choose.]

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "A Duty to Propose", be
created with the following text:

      Active Players not in their Grace Periods shall periodically incur
      a duty to submit a Proposal, as described in this Rule.

      The Promotor shall maintain an alphabetically ordered list of
      Players. When a Player submits a Proposal while required to do
      so by this Rule, the Promotor shall place an asterisk ('*') next
      to their name on the list. Whenever it occurs that every Active
      Player not in their Grace Period has an asterisk next to their
      name, then the Promotor shall remove all asterisks from the list.

[I'm aware of a flaw in this method: the last Player on the list can
always avoid the duty to propose by going On Hold just before their turn
comes up. Any suggestions on how to fix this, without making things too
complicated?]

      As soon as possible after the beginning of the week, the Promotor
      shall publish in the Public Forum the names of the two Active
      Players not in their Grace Periods whose names appear highest on
      the list. These two Players are each required to submit a Proposal
      within two weeks of the Promotor's announcement. Failure to do so
      is the Infraction of Failing to Propose, to be detected and
      reported by the Promotor, and incurring a penalty of 1 Blot and 1
      P-Note.

That's not being nitpicky; the Judgement of CFJ 1100 holds that this is
the meaning of R1808/0. However, the Rule has now been amended (by
P3793) to remove the word "directly" from it.

Good point. But it seems to me the PO Blob is referring to was issued
before the result of P3793 was published, so Blob's PO is ineffective
under the old wording of the rule.

I see a big technical problem if the voting tariff is 0: then, R1442
will require the Assessor to issue POs for 0 VTs which are prohibited
by R1596.

Unfortunately, the proposal has already been submitted with the bug.

The main advantage I see is that you don't need self-repealing Rules
(which I object to on a variety of principles) to impose one-time or
short-term duties.  It also has the merit that the result of adopting
a Proposal more naturally corresponds to what we would think it would
be.  I also think there is merit to having a clearer historical
record.
<<

I'm not a lawyer, so I don't share your desire to avoid
self-modification on grounds of principle. 

But I think that the growing collection of invalid rules that still
must be kept around will be a recordkeeping nightmare, and make it
very difficult for new players or those on a low time budget to
understand which rules are valid and in what form. Of course, you
could trust the officer responsible for tracking the status of rules,
but e might also make mistakes, or loose control emself (as lee nearly
did with VTs). Maybe Chuck would be up to the task, but still I think
that would make it very difficult for many players to form an
independent opinion on the state of the laws at a given time.

I can't state it with absolute certainty, of course, but I have
_never_ seen any provision in any actual law that changes _itself_
without intervention.
<<

I'm not sure about laws, but there are some interesting examples
coming up where whole classes of private contracts will automatically
change their content when the Euro is introduced as a new currency
here in Euroland: many contracts connect prices, interest rates and
similar quantities to the development in time of a fundamental
monetary quantity like some short term interest rate set by a central
bank. Now, the central bank will change, and there will be one such
fundamental quantity to replace the many national ones that were based
on different national currencies and definitions of "fundamental
interest rate". But contracts involving references to such fundamental
quantities will not loose their validity, but automatically refer to
the new quantity in the future, without any need for renegotiation or
explicit change. This is the content of some laws that accompany the
introduction of the Euro.

But I'm not sure whether references to quantities which change in
nature due to the Euro and which occur in laws, not contracts, will
also be changed automatically, or whether all such laws will be
amended by hand.

I'd rather not see a duty with punishment in case of default. But
there might be a reward for proposing, and maybe this reward should be
so strong that it's hard to resist. For example (as someone else
suggested) abolish unemployment benefits and install a small VT reward
for proposing. That would put a lot of pressure on players to propose,
without the need for a "duty" enforced with negative sanctions.

Of course, then you'll have to prevent people from making null or just
boringly silly proposals. Maybe the reward should go to proposals
which earn at least one FOR vote from non-proposers (allowing for
scamlets to earn a reward for pointless proposals anyway, thus
encouraging people to vote against such proposals, generating a lot of
activity...)

You have misapprehended the system.  Invalid rules would be removed 
from the codified rules when they are invalidated.

I really don't see how the duty that would be imposed is all that much

To be honest, I have less of a problem with self-repealing rules than
I do with self-modifying ones.  Worse yet are other-modifying rules.
The problem is mainly that such rules introduce ambiguity in the state
of the rules, which is a truly bad thing.  If there is a dispute over
the effect of a self-modifying or other-modifying rule, it is unclear
what the legal form of the affected rule is.  This may lead to serious
problems (e.g. the Frankenstein Monster rule, which created some
rather serious uncertainties of law, which led to its eventual
vanquishment).  

On the other hand, if the only way to affect the rules is by the
proclamation of adopted proposals, then it becomes relatively easy to
tell what the rules are (just look at what proposals have been

The practical importance arises when you think about how you deal with
error.  Our present Rules do not deal at all well with error with
respect to the reporting of Proposal results, for example.

If you do this, I will propose, often enough to satisfy the duty

Well, I'm not a lawyer either, and I don't understand how being a

Unless you Europeans do things a lot differently, what is being done
is the adoption of a tenet of contractual construction that states
that references to the prior currencies shall be read so as to refer
to the equivalent amount of the new currency.  The contracts are not
actually amended; rather, the law requires that they be read as if
they had been amended.

Quite definitely the latter.  Laws (all Agoran notions of self-agency
notwithstanding) cannot change themselves.  If you don't believe me,
get out an official copy of one of those laws and watch it very
closely on the date when the change takes place.  I suspect you will
find that the text does not change, even though its meaning does.

No more than if there is a dispute over the effect of a Proposal,
it seems to me.

Hardly a strong argument, since we knew when we adopted the Frankenstein
monster that it was likely to cause uncertainty and chaos.  If our
goal was to minimize uncertainty, we certainly never would have
adopted the Frankenstein monster.

The effect of a Proposal may be disputed just as much as the effect
of a Rule.

Could you elaborate?

It can be withdrawn before it is distributed. I think. (Is R1774
working?)

That's absolutely fine by me. In the current version of the proto, this
would be about once every two months.

I still don't completely understand your opposition though. Is requiring
Players to contribute one Proposal to the game every two months such a
terrible idea? I don't think so; I think it embodies a fine idea of
public service to the game.

On the other hand, the Virus operated every week for 2 years without
causing any serious uncertainty whatsoever. So your argument fails to
show that there is a fundamental difficulty with other-modifying Rules.
What's more, your argument is flawed even with respect to the
Frankenstein Monster. For while it is true that there were serious
uncertainties about how the Frankenstein Monster should be *interpreted*
(because it didn't make any sense), there were no serious uncertainties
as to what the Frankenstein Monster actually *said*, ie what it's text
was, which is what you claim is the problem with other-modifying Rules.

It seems to me that other-modifying Rules, just like Proposals, can be
well or badly written. When well written, there is no reason in
principle to think that they should cause special problems.

I doubt a reward system would work, and in any case, I don't want to
restrict the duty to propose just to the unemployed. My conception of it
is that of a public service to the game, part of the responsibility of
being a Player.

Interestingly, the rarely-invoked R404 limits what we can do here: we
cannot make the legality of making a Proposal conditional on its
content. We can try to reward interesting Proposals, though. It seems to
me that one measure of interest is the number of votes cast on the
Proposal. The more votes cast on a Proposal, the more controversial it
tends to have been. So perhaps the proposer should receive some fraction
of the VTs spent on the Proposal.

I wrote the above in a hurry last night, and yes, I have noticed that
the last paragraph makes no use of the asterisk system introduced in the
second paragraph. I'm working on a new version.

This is simply not true.  A myriad of "reported" changes to the
Frankenstein Rule turned out to not have been made, because of error.
Our handling of error in this situation was pathetic.  I believe that
allowing self-modifying and other-modifying rules dramatically
increases the possibility of an unchecked error cascade.  Aside from
philosophical reasons, this is my primary opposition to them.

The problem is that we might not even know _IF_ a self-modifying or
other-modifying rule has operated.  It's pretty obvious when a
Proposal has been adopted.  The chance for error cascade is much
greater when multiple major events (such as rule changes) can arise
without any need for human action or even human awareness.

That's not the point.

Charles> Could you elaborate?

Suppose the Assessor correctly reports that a Proposal has passed,
then mistakenly reports that it did not pass, but the Assessor's
mistake is not recognized for six months.  Under the present regime,
the Rule Changes pursuant to that Proposal take effect at the time of
the first report, even though nobody believed they were in effect for
the subsequent six months.  This is unacceptable to me, and would not
happen in the regime I propose.

D'oh! I can't believe I keep making this unbelievably sophomoric
mistakes.

Heh. Unfortunately, that is not a very practical suggestion. Even if it
were, though, all of the veteran Players would, over the course of the
last 5 years, have made enough Proposals to prevent them from incurring
any future duty to vote for a very long time to come, and this would
this make the Proposal politically unsaleable to the newer Players. In
any case, our problem is a dearth of Proposals in the present, not in the
past.
