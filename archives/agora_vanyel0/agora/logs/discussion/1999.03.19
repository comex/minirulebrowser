Players need to propose.  I could not imagine anybody playing Agora if 
they could not propose.  Although there is a certain amount which can be 
gained through voting on the proposals of others, and using the rules 
make other actions, the heart of Agora has to be being able to propose.

The reason why players want to propose is so their ideas will affect 
others for whatever reason.  Although Agora is very open minded, many 
players will still wish to gain power over other players, and to a large 
extent this is why they will make proposals.

If a player wnats to propse and cannot, then they will try find some 
other way of gaining power.  This could be by trading so that they can 
propose, or by some different method altogether....

(Hmm what strange things I write, hope I don't offend many people)

Is this needed, players will make deals between themselves, and the 
result will be the same.  (As long as somebody does support the proposal 
and expect it to be adopted.)

The entire point is to _force_ Players to make deals between

For some reason I can't see why that would be appealing to people.  Why 
would we want this?

I believe Blob has set that to Unrestricted.  I don't keep track of
that; even the inclusion of the voting cost in the distribution is a
courtesy.

What's the rationale for that last Order? Has the payment of Blob's
Commission been on those Proposals been held up awaiting resolution of
this matter?

Proto-Proposal
A Separation of Powers

This Proposal has an Adoption Index of 2.

[Comment: the basic framework is surprisingly easy to put in place,
because we already have the concepts of a Voting Entity and a Proposing
Entity defined. They seem, and probably were, made to prepare for this
kind of innovation.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rule entitled "Legislators and Voters" be
created with the following text:

      Every Player is either a Legislator or a Voter. By default, every
      Player is a Voter. Newly registered Players are Voters. 

      A Legislator has the right to submit Proposals, but may not cast
      votes on Proposals (i.e., e is a Proposing Entity but not a Voting
      Entity). A Voter has the right to cast votes on Proposals, but not
      to submit Proposals (i.e., e is a Voting Entity but not a
      Proposing Entity).

      A Voter may become a Legislator, or a Legislator a Voter, by
      announcing that e is doing so in the Public Forum, provided that
      e has not changed from being a Legislator to being a Voter, or
      vice versa, during the previous two months.

      The Registrar shall record whether each Player is a Legislator or
      a Voter, and the date and time at which e last became either a
      Legislator or a Voter, and include it in eir Registrar's Report.


Be it further resolved that R206 (Voting Entities and Votes) be amended
by deleting the text:

      Players and Groups are Voting Entities.


Be it further resolved that R766 (Groups) be amended by appending to it
a new paragraph which reads:

      Each Group is a Voting Entity.


Be it further resolved that R1605 (Proposing Entities) be amended by
replacing the text:

      Each Player is a Proposing Entity.  Other entities are Proposing
      Entities only if defined as such by the Rules.

with the text:

      A Player or other entity is a Proposing Entity only if defined to
      be so by the Rules.


Be it further resolved that R879 (Quorum) be amended by replacing the
phrase "Active Players" with the phrase "Active Voters".


Be it further resolved that R1873 (A Duty to Vote) be amended by
replacing the phrase "Active Player" with the phrase "Active Voter", and
by deleting the paragraph which reads: 

      Three months after this Rule is created, it repeals itself.

I don't care much for the terminology. We don't have "questions",
certifiable or otherwise, in Agora, but, by long-standing tradition,
Statements. You are revising the provisions concerning what we have
known for 6 years as Appealing a Judgement. Why must we now have this
new terminology of "certifying questions" to describe this?

Otherwise, this looks reasonably good.

Yes, it was one of the two Orders stayed as a consequence of that CFJ;
the commission calculated was overlarge as a result of miscounting
Vlad's vote.

Because we also appeal things besides Judgements: we appeal
dismissals, we appeal the grant or denial of a Motion, we appeal the
execution of a Judicial Order, and we appeal misconduct of Judges.
None of these is a Judgement.  I say, have you read the Rules lately?
