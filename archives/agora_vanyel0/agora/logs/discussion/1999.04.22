I question whether that which is considered honourable in one nomic
is necessarily honourable in another.

I question that as well--I think I, for one, would have scrutinized
the message more carefully as being from Steve Gardner.  However,
he might have gotten away with it if he had set up a freemail
account--which was really his--and used that.  But he didn't.

Still, as I detailed previously, I agree with elJefe that Steve should
not be expelled from the game.

Welcome aboard harvel! You have certainly chosen an Interesting Time (tm)
to get involved.

In the tradition of past Speakers, I hereby exercise my Right of Patronage
to award 1 Indulgence to harvel, for registering as a new player, which is
always of benefit to the Agoran community.

I hereby order the Bank to pay out 1 Indulgence to havel.

Indeed.  --Is it just me, or do more new Players tend to show up near
Interesting Controversies such as the current one regarding Summary
Adoption than at other times?

Then again, I don't remember a time (during my Watching) when there weren't
Interesting Controversies.

Thank you.  I hope I won't be needing it right away...
