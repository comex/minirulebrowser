My first reaction to this was: "Hm. Good point. I should have thought
of that."

My second reaction was to write the following essay, which I humbly
submit for comment from the wider Nomic community.


The concept of a 'rule change' in Suber's Initial Ruleset
---------------------------------------------------------


In this essay, I wish to examine Suber's Initial Ruleset to test the
hypothesis that in that Ruleset, all rule changes have to be proposed. 
No, I need to be clearer than that. I mean the hypothesis that all
rule changes occur as the direct result of a Proposal being adopted,
specifically excluding the possibility that Rules (which of course
will themselves have been created - ultimately - as the result of the
adoption of a Proposal) can have among their effects the adoption of
rule changes.

There's an obvious objection to this hypothesis which must be dealt
with if we are to take the hypothesis at all seriously. It is simply
this: if we accept the possibility (by which I mean here the legality
in the Initial Set) of self-repealing and self-amending Rules, then
we shall have an immediate counterexample to the hypothesis, for then
there will be some rule changes which do occur due the effects of
Rules, which are not directly the result of a Proposal being adopted.

In response to this objection, I am inclined to accept, with some
reservations to be noted below, that self-repealing and self-amending
Rules can be legally adopted and be legally effective in the Initial
Set. This forces me to modify the hypothesis to be tested so that it
becomes the claim that (and I'll specially mark this as the central
claim of this article):

(*)   Other-amending, other-creating and other-repealing rule changes
      are not legal in Suber's Initial Set where they purport to
      occur as the result of the effect or action of a Rule, rather
      than as the direct result of the adoption of a Proposal.

The claim made in (*) is that, in general, all rule changes are
proposed and adopted, with special exception made for self-repealing
and self-amending Rules.

Before we look at the evidence for this claim, it's worth remarking
that as far as I know, no Nomic has ever taken this view of the
Initial Set. The significance of this historical observation is
difficult to assess. An obvious, if hasty, conclusion to draw would
be that the reason no Nomic has ever taken such a view (if indeed
that's the case) is that the view is simply mistaken, and that 
there are good reasons to conclude, on the basis of the language
used in the Initial Set, that other-amending and other-repealing 
Rules *are* legal in the Initial Set. If that's right, then my first
reaction was the correct one.

But there are other possibilities. I helped to start the very first
game of Nomic to be played over the Internet (Nomic World), in August
1992, and I can confidently say that neither I nor any of the other
Players commencing that game, ever considered the question of whether
(*) might be true. Rather, we just assumed the falsity of (*), and
proceeded from there. That assumption was inherited by Agora, the
game which arose from the ruins left by the collapse of Nomic World,
and from there it was passed on to other games which took Agora as
a rough model, such as Ackanomic and Thring (and I trust they won't
be offended by that characterization). My point is only that the views
of the Initial Set held by the various Nomics now in existence (I
suppose we should restrict ourselves to those Nomics which actually
commenced play with something reasonably close to Suber's Initial Set),
are not all independent of each other. It's not as if Nomic World, Agora,
Thring and Ackanomic have all independently arrived at the conclusion
that (*) is false based on a close examination of the evidence. On
the contrary, I think this may be the first time that the evidence
ever has been closely examined. 

With that plea for open-mindedness fresh before us, let's take a look
at what the Initial Set has to say about rule changes. The words
'rule change' or 'rule changes' appear 20 times in the Initial Set. 
Its first appearance, not surprisingly, occurs in the definition of
the term given in R103:

103. A rule change is any of the following: (1) the enactment, repeal,
     or amendment of a mutable rule; (2) the enactment, repeal or
     amendment of an amendment; or (3) the transmutation of an
     immutable rule into a mutable rule, or vice versa.

There's no evidence here either for or against (*). R103 speaks of
rule changes quite generally, and is silent about whether such rule
changes are to be thought of as occurring as the result of the adoption
of Proposals, or as the result of the effect of Rules. It's consistent
with R103 - and, of course with (*) - that both are allowed.

Subsequent Rules in the Initial Set make use of the newly defined term
(R108 is quoted only in part):

104. All rule changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on.
     They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required
     number of votes.
105. Every player is an eligible voter. Every elegible voter must
     participate in every vote on rule changes.
106. Any proposed rule change must be written down before it is voted
     on. If adopted, it must guide play in the form in which it was
     voted on.
107. No rule change may take effect earlier than the moment of the
     completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording
     explicitly states otherwise. No rule change may have retroactive
     application.
108. Each rule change shall be given a rank order-number (ordinal
     number) for reference. The numbers shall begin with 301, and each
     rule change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next
     successive integer, whether or not the proposal is adopted.
109. Rule changes that transmute immutable rules into mutable rules may
     be adopted if and only if the vote is unaminous among the
     eligible voters.
202. One turn consists of two parts, in this order: (1) proposing one
     rule change and having it voted on; and (2) throwing one die once
     and adding the number of points on its face to one's score.
203. A rule change is adopted if and only if the vote is unaminous
     among the eligible voters.
204. If and when rule changes can be adopted without unanimity, the
     players who vote against winning proposals shall receive 10
     points apiece.
205. An adopted rule change takes full effect at the moment of the
     completion of the vote that adopted it.
206. When a proposed rule change is defeated, the player who proposed
     it loses 10 points.

These Rules contain considerable evidence in favour of (*), inasmuch
as in every one of these Rules, the term 'rule change' appears in a
context in which it is spoken of as being 'proposed', 'voted on' or
'adopted'. This suggests quite strongly that the conception of rule
changes in the Initial Set is that they are to be thought of as
essentially the kinds of things that appear in Proposals. That's
actually a stronger claim than is made in (*), which allows for
exceptions in the case of self-repealing and self-amending Rules, for
reasons which will shortly become apparent.  The evidence, however,
is not conclusive. One might read the Rules 104-109 as applying
simply to a subset of the allowable rule changes, namely the proposed
rule changes, while remaining silent about any other kinds of rule
changes, namely those contained in Rules, that might occur. One can
make sense at least of R104 on this reading: all the *proposed* rule
changes have to be voted on, and these proposed rule changes are
adopted if and only if they receive the required number of votes.
Rule changes in Rules are not proposed rule changes, and so they
don't have to be voted on, nor do they have to receive the required
number of votes, which is fortunate since they won't *be* voted on -
not directly - at all. And we can make similar sense of Rules 105,
106, 109, 203, 204 and so on.

There are serious problems with this reading, however. Rule 108, for
example, says that '*each* rule change' - not 'each proposed rule
change', but each and every rule change, shall be given a number for
reference, starting at 301.  It's bizarre to think of rule changes
occurring as the result of the effect of Rules (self-amendments and
self-repeals, amendments and repeals and even creations of Rules by
other Rules) receiving numbers, especially numbers from the same
sequence as Proposals.

Or consider R107. If 'proposed rule changes' are merely a subset of
the 'rule changes', then we have to read the ban on retroactivty as
generally  applying to all rule changes, while the first sentence
will apply only to proposed rule changes, since these are the only
rule changes which are voted on. In general, since most of the
Initial Set concerns itself with rules changes that are proposed,
voted on and adopted, none of the restrictions or properties that are
attached to them - when they take effect, etc - will apply to rule
changes appearing in Rules.

I don't claim that any of this is completely conclusive. I think that
one can, without contradiction, hold fast to the position that rule
changes can quite generally occur as the result of the effect of
Rules. But I think it's a very awkward position to defend given how
much of the language actually employed in the Initial Set speaks of
rule changes being proposed, voted on and adopted. And I certainly
think that the preponderance of the evidence is against that position
and in favour of the view that in the Initial Set, all rule changes
are proposed rule changes.

However, that stronger claim, ie, my first claim, the one I modified
into (*), also cannot be defended on the basis of the language
used in the Initial Set. Indeed, I now want to address the question
of why I felt compelled to defend (*), and not the stronger claim
that simply all rule changes occur as the direct result of the
adoption of proposals.

The simple answer to this question is the inclusion in the Initial
Set of Rule 115:

115. Rule changes that affect rules needed to allow or apply rule
     changes are as permissible as other rule changes. Even rule
     changes that amend or repeal their own authority are permissible.
     No rule change or type of move is impermissible solely on account
     of the self-reference or self-application of a rule.

The first sentence of R115 merely emphasizes that in Nomic, the rule
changing mechanisms are as open to change as anything else, a point
Suber obviously felt the need to stress to new players. But the second
sentence explicitly permits rule changes that amend and repeal their
own authority, which I think can only be interpreted to license the
adoption of self-amending and self-repealing Rules. The third sentence
hammers the point home that *self*-reference and *self*-application
are allowed in rules and rule changes. Since self-amending and self-
repealing Rules clearly are permitted according to the Initial Set,
I had to modify the strong claim in some way. Given the great weight
of evidence for the strong claim in the rest of the Initial Set, and
given that R115 speaks so specifically about self-reference, self-
amendment, self-repeal, and self-application, while remaining silent
about the other conceivable kinds of rule changes that Rules might
contain (ie other-amending, other-repealing, and other-creating rule
changes) it seemed to me that the most natural modification to make
was the minimal one of allowing self-amending and self-repealing
Rules as exceptions to the strong claim. Hence the move to defend (*).

I anticipate an objection along the following lines. In the argument
given above I have many times made use of the distinction between a
rule change which takes effect as the direct result of the adoption of
a proposal, and a rule change which takes effect as the result of the
action or effect of a Rule. The importance of the phrase '*direct*
result' is to emphasize that I do not think that we can regard rule
changes which occur as the result of the effect or action of a Rule
as having been proposed, voted on or adopted. Indeed, in Agora we
called such rule changes 'Non-Proposed Rule Changes'. One might want
to deny this, and claim that rule changes which occur as the result
of the effect or action of a Rule, eg the self-repeal of a Rule,
*have*, indirectly, been proposed, voted on and adopted. One might
want to claim that the proposing, voting and adoption of this rule
change is the proposing, voting and adoption of the Proposal which
created (or amended) the Rule which contains the rule change as
part of its effect.

I think there are deep problems with this claim, however. Consider
the provision in R104 that rule changes are adopted if and only
if they receive the required number of votes. On the view being
examined, we shall have to regard the self-repeal of a Rule, say,
or the repeal of a Rule by another Rule, as, indirectly, having
been voted on when the Proposal creating or amending the Rule
was voted on. But is that plausible? Imagine Proposal P, which
proposes to create Rule X, which says that if condition C is met,
Rule Y shall be repealed. P is adopted unanimously. Can we regard
this as a unanimous vote for the repeal of Rule Y? Of course not,
for the voters may think that condition C will never be met. The
most I think we can deduce is that there has been a unanimous vote
that if condition C is met, Rule Y will be repealed. But that is
not in itself a rule change, and it's the rule change we need to
think of as being voted on and adopted if the suggestion is to
work.

My apologies to all of you for the extraordinary length of this
article, one of the longest I have ever written in 5 years of
playing Nomic. My thanks to Michael Shimmin, whose comments inspired
me to write it. Please consider it a draft; it's been written in
something of a hurry, and I'm sure it could be improved in many ways.

> The concept of a 'rule change' in Suber's Initial Ruleset
> ---------------------------------------------------------

Very interesting and thought-provoking essay, Steve. Allow me to
correct an innocuous error: it's 'Robert Shimmin' you probably mean,
rather than 'Michael Shimmin'. Some sort of unconscious homage to
Agora's First Speaker, maybe ? ;)

A few comments, not respecting the original flow of your essay:

> One might
> want to claim that the proposing, voting and adoption of this rule
> change is the proposing, voting and adoption of the Proposal which
> created (or amended) the Rule which contains the rule change as

If one grants that Suber's Rule 115 authorizes self-amendment or
self-repeals, a possible refutation to this argument would be to
consider a hypothetical variant of Suber's Ruleset including one
or more self-amending or self-repealing Rules.

Obviously, this would lead to one or more Rule changes which would
never had been Proposed or even voted upon. A counter-objection might
be that the inclusion of such a Rule (or Rules) in the Initial Ruleset
would make it sufficiently unlike Suber's Ruleset to place it outside
the domain of your essay; an objection which could, I think, be refuted
by pointing out that, for instance, Rule 101 :

      All Players must always abide by all the Rules then in effect,
      in the form in which they are then in effect.  The Rules in the
      Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the first game.
      The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (Immutable) and
      201-219 (Mutable).

could have (should have ?) contained a clause amending away the last
two sentences when they no longer held true. (Interestingly, I lift
the above text of Rule 101 out of... Agora's own Ruleset, where it
has endured with no change from the version contained in Agora's own
variant of Suber's Initial Ruleset for more than 4 years.)

Such a clause would have been logical, in keeping with the spirit of
Rule 115, and in fact I often wondered on its absence in Suber's
Ruleset.

> The importance of the phrase '*direct*
> result' is to emphasize that I do not think that we can regard rule
> changes which occur as the result of the effect or action of a Rule

Agora's Ruleset actually _defined_ Non-Proposed Rule Changes at one
time, as Rule Changes effected as the direct effect of one or more
Rules, and being one of the two valid types of Rule Changes (the other
was Rule Changes contained in a Proposal, or Proposed Rule Changes); it
no longer does, though we still _call_ them Non-Proposed Rule Changes.

This Rule was used at one point to quash a Scam using an argument
about Agora's Rule 116 that I've recently seen brought up again in
the recent InterNomic debate : interpreting the clause "changing the
Rules, which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly
or implicitly permits it" to mean that the presence of one Rule
authorizing Rule Changes somewhere in the Ruleset meant that one
could, for instance, effect Rule Changes by posting them to the
Public Forum. The Scam was easily defeated by pointing out that
such Rule Changes were neither Proposed nor Non-Proposed, and
thus illegal. ;)

> (*)   Other-amending, other-creating and other-repealing rule changes
>       are not legal in Suber's Initial Set where they purport to

You are, I suppose, aware that (*) is a trivially correct observation
if one examines Suber's Initial Ruleset and _only_ that; that Ruleset
itself contains no Rules purporting to amend, repeal, or create other
Rules, thus such Rule Changes are obviously not 'legal' in a pristine
Suberian Ruleset, insofar as they do not exist at all.

What (*) actually means, I suppose, is that if one were to adopt, as
the first Rule enactment in a Suberian Nomic, a Rule purporting to
repeal, amend or enact an other Rule, that Rule would be prevented
from taking effect insofar as it attempted such Rule changes.

Presumably this is not limited to Suber's Initial Ruleset, though;
if such a Nomic were to adopt, for instance, Rules dealing with an
economy, or its Judicial process, the conditions such that (*)
obtains in a Suberian Ruleset would be unmodified, and our hypothetical
"other-changing" Rule would still be ineffective if enacted then
rather than earlier.

You go on to quote Rules from Suber's Ruleset, such as 107 or 108,
which hint at a defense of (*), concluding with :

> I don't claim that any of this is completely conclusive. I think that
> one can, without contradiction, hold fast to the position that rule

This is, I think, where your essay could be perfected. As you know,
Agora, to name but one Nomic, currently uses one other-changing
Rule as a moderately important part of game play, that which governs
Agora's Frankenstein Monster. (For non-Agorans, the Monster is a
Rule that is being continually cobbled together from mutated parts
of other Rules - more or less randomly, with sometimes boring,
sometimes interesting effects.)

Thus, the question you will have to answer sooner or later is at
what point Agora changed from a Suberian Nomic, i.e. one with
non-other-changing Rules, to one which allows such Rules. In
particular, _which_ of the Rules you mention are critical in 
supporting (*), together or severally ? What are the minimal
Rule changes needed to turn a Suberian Ruleset into an Agoran
one ? (That would adress the issue of how 'fairly easy' it is
to alter the totality of a Ruleset into another Ruleset, as
a function of where along the Suberian-Agoran axis a given
Ruleset lies.)

The example of CFJ 938 showed that there is a hole in 1565: CFJ 938
violated 789, yet there was no clear consequence of this. There were
twp possible interpretations of the word "must" 789:

1. A la Kudo transfers: A document that fails to comply with 789 is
not a CFJ after all (and 789 takes precedence over the higher-numbered
991. 

2. It remains a CFJ, but violates 789, with no obvious consequence
(except a possible penalty due to 1439).

The easiest way to deal with this would have been to just dismiss the
CFJ, but the exact wording of 1565 didn't allow it: 1565 iv) only
mentions _statements_, not whole CFJs, that fail to comply with the
rules. 

I see four possibe improvements of 1565 as a lesson of this. I'd like
to proto them all, but they are rather independent, so if you like one
of them and dislike another, please tell me so I can propose them
separately, or only the ones that are acceptable.


Amendment 1 of 1565:

Replace the old point 
       iv) Its Statement fails to comply with the Rules.
by
       iv) The CFJ fails to comply with the Rules.

[This would allow dismissal of CFJs with formal mistakes like CFJ 938.]


Amendment 2 of 1565:

Add a paragraph 
"If a CFJ is dismissed according to this rule the caller of the CFJ
may not be penalized in any other way for rule violations connected
with the dismissed CFJ. This paragraph takes precedence over all rules
prescribing such penalties."

[I am not sure about the exact phrasing of this, but the point is that
if you follow reasoning 2. mentioned above, amendment 1 would allow a
dismissal of the CFJ, but the CFJ would still be in violation of the
rules, with uncertain consequences and a possible penalty according to
1439. Now dismissal of a CFJ is not a "penalty" in the sense of the
Rules, so the double jeopardy rule doesn't apply, but still there
would be a double, and redundant, punishment without an amendment like
this.

I am open for suggestions of a better phrasing.]


The last two amendments are more about cleaning up 1565 while we are
at it.

Amendment 3 of 1565:

Delete point v) and renumber old vi) as new v).

[v) seems to be an unused provision that noone quite understands. If we
remember what it is good for we can always reinstall it, but as it is
it's only extra ballast without function.]


Amendment 4 of 1565 (cosmetic):

Replace the string "when only when" in the third paragraph by "only
when". 

In the last paragraph replace "a Judicial Salary of 3 Mil" by "a
Judicial Salary of 1 VT".

[Funny how long these Mils went unnoticed, innit.]

Steve Gardner writes a fascinating article. 

My initial reaction is that you could stick to the stronger claim,
that even rule changes which purport to change the rule brought about
the rule change are illegal.

The following sentence is the root of the problem:

  "Even rule changes that amend or repeal their own authority are
   permissible."

I do not believe, as you seem to, that this is permission for rules
brought about by rule changes to subsequently modify themselves.
Rather I believe that this is merely a sentence added to emphasise the
first sentence of 115, "Rule changes that affect rules needed to allow
or apply rule changes are as permissible as other rule changes."

Let's pick apart the problematic sentence.  We have to imagine a rule
change that amends or repeals its own authority.  This seems pretty
vague at first blush.  What exactly is a rule change's authority?
Well, simple grammatical analysis says that a rule change's authority
must be a rule, because it's rules that rule changes are allowed to
amend and repeal.

However, I don't believe that we need to then make the leap that Steve
does and conclude that the rule meant is a rule including a rule
change.  This is convenient, and it is the fundamental assumption
behind Nomic World and Agoran practice.  (I always held a strong
dislike for it in the Agoran context; but even First Speakers yield to
prior precedent sometimes.)  No doubt, the practice is one that seems
particularly reasonable because it seems to be the sort of thing that
also happens in the real world.

Nonetheless, it seems to me that one could just as well interpret the
second sentence as 115 as a claim to the effect that one _is_ allowed
to amend 103 (after first making it mutable), to make amendments no
longer valid rule changes.  (Or that one could repeal it.)  It seems
perfectly reasonable to assume that 103 is a rule change's authority,
and all that the nasty second sentence is saying is that it's not
immune to change.

What of the third sentence?  It talks about rule's being
self-referential and possibly self-applicable.  Both situations are
easy enough to imagine without letting self-repealing rules in the
door.  For example, R108 is both self-referential and self-applicable
in the situation where it is about to be amended.

What a clean world, of well-separated rules and rule changes, we have
lost in (unnecessarily) allowing self-repealing rules!

Michael.

Kolja A. proposes a bit of a judicial clean-up.

I support amendments 2 - 4.  I would prefer that instead of amendment
1, you went with the 'it never was a CFJ approach', in the same way
that attempts to perform a Kudo transfer can fail.   

I'd suggest adding a provision to 991 stating the required basic form
of a CFJ, but also stating that other rules may add other constraints
which a body of text must satisfy before it can be considered a CFJ.
The Rule-Interpretation CFJ rule then adds the appropriate constraint
for this case.

(You could also encompass the penalty of excess CFJ submission in this
approach.  Simply add a constraint to the effect that a putative CFJ
is only one such if the submitter has not previously submitted five
CFJs in that Week.  Platonism rules OK! :-)

<<

My idea was that via my amendment 1 the final result is clear: CFJ
dismissed. But that it is _not_ necessary to decide whether it was a
proper CFJ or not: never mind that, at the end it is dismissed
anyway. So I don't think my amendment 1 would be a decision agaist the
'it never was a CFJ approach' - this question of approaches is left
open; all that is regulated is the final outcome.

Then all fishy can be dismissed, and thus they gain a clearly defined
status for the game, but no elaborate extension of the definition of a
CFJ, putative CFJs etc, as you suggested, is needed.

I admit that that isn't very Platonic, it's more results oriented. But
I think it would do the job.

Yeah, but it states that *no* Rule Change shall be illegal *solely*
on account of its self-referentiality. I thought the reasoning went,
a Rule can't in general amend a Rule, and in particular can't amend
itself - so the self-ref clause states that since a Rule seeking to
amend itself would be illegal solely on account of its attempting
to amend itself, it will be allowed to do so. Or something like
that...

I see a fifth...

Replace the last paragraph with the following...

A Judge who dismisses a CFJ which is not successfully appealed shall
receive a Judicial Salary of 1 VT.

Or maybe that's just an extension on your fourth.

I don't see a problem with any of your protos... they all look good to me.

The story in this version of events states that a rule can't change a
rule, because it is not a rule change.  This in turn is backed up by
the strong language (particularly 107: "No rule change may take effect
earlier than the moment of the completion of the vote that adopted
it"), that implies that rule changes are equivalent to proposals. 

Note that the 3rd sentence says that a rule change shall not be
disallowed on the grounds of self-reference or self-application of a
_rule_.  If we accept that rules can't be rule changes, this is still
consistent, because rules are generally forbidden from amending
themselves.  The self-reference bit doesn't come into it.  My comment
about 108 simply points out that the sentence does pertain to a
possible situation and isn't entirely vacuous. 

Michael.

I don't really see the use for this. Dismissing a CFJ is not harsh enough
to be a penalty in my view, while violating a Rule definitely should
entail one.

Just a side remark on what I think is an underlying assumption in
Steve's essay, when e writes

>>
Before we look at the evidence for this claim, it's worth remarking
that as far as I know, no Nomic has ever taken this view of the
Initial Set. [snip, this point discussed in some detail]
<<

So you assume one can separate the rule set proper and what players
(possibly by mistake) make out of it, right? In a sense you say that
there is one "real" interpretation of the rule set, and if you look at
the rules carefully enough, you'll find it.

But I thought that the judicial system, which is already part of the
initial rules concept, is not only there because players will make
mistakes, misread the rules and so forth, and they'll need a way out
of the mess they created; rather, the judicial system also allows
players to be creative without "making mistakes". In that sense I
always took the inclusion of the judicial system as a hint that
different interpretations of the rules, as for example different
answers as to whether (*) is true or not, are part of the game -
making such interpretations is just as creative a part of playing as
making new rules.

In that sense I would expect that Suber emself would not be able to
say whether (*) is true in eir initial rule set - he'd say "It depends
on what juges say in your particular game". You might even play Nomic
with the same group twice, starting from the initial set each time, and
try different interpretations - no "mistakes" or substantial "changes
of mind" involved, just like "let's try something different this
time!". Neither game would be more "right" or "wrong" (it feels
strange to be making such a relativist kind of a point - in most real
life issues I don't like these "do whatever you like, it's all ok as
long as you're being genuine" attitudes at all. But after all, this is
just a game.)

Even if the violation is merely a bureaucratic one? I tend to
oppose "red-tape" Rules in general, and I certainly oppose
the idea of punishing someone for an action that does no one
any harm.

This is why I am not a big fan of stare decisis. Sure, it's
easy enough to say that in theory judgments should be consistent.
But when Steve has to go digging through records from years ago,
when the general outlook of the game was quite different, in
order to judge the legality of his CFJ, seems a bit extreme.
I have no problem with a new decision being made ad hoc (although
in this case there seem to be no official precedent.) Perhaps
we could limit stare decisis to CFJ's judged within the last three
months?

My personal preference is that "improper" CFJs are still CFJs, but
should be dismissed.  Wording to the effect that a CFJ must be
dismissed if its making was unpermitted should be sufficient.

I don't much care for the "psuedo-CFJ" situation; I think it
introduces ambiguity and fosters state-splitting.  I would prefer for
CFJs, like Proposals, to be bloody obvious, and use dismissal as a
mechanism to handle things that we would rather not be handled CFJs.

Again, this is part of the general concept that Officers should not
have to make complex determinations of law in order to perform their
duties.  The suggestions above remove the duty of identifying
"improper" CFJs from the hands of the Clerk of the Courts and places
it in the hands of a Judge, which is where it rightfully belongs.

This is my preference too.  I'd go further to say, change the wording to make
it clear that improperly made CFJ's are not illegal (i.e. you don't break the
Rules by submitting one).

But you demonstrably had time to engage in discussion.  I think you
could have slipped in a "Zefram is Elected Registrar by acclamation"
at some time in those three or four days.

Maybe the conclusion of these two comments is that we should not remove
the "lacks standing" provision, but rather start using it for "red tape" 
things that we want to discourage but do not want to punish as Rule
Violations.

An added comment on this: I believe we have a long tradition in Agora for
being lenient wrt. minor Violations, simply by not reporting them.

This is always possible for Crimes as far as I know, since they use the
CFJ system. For Infractions, I believe that some of them use phrasing like
"shall be reported by", which makes their reporting mandatory, while some
use "... is authorized to report ..."  which places no such demand." 

I suspect this may be part of the cause why Crimes are almost never
reported, while Infractions usually are. (Other reasons are presumably:
that Infractions are easier to report, and that Crimes have stricter
penalties so that people more rarely commit them.)

Greetings,
Ørjan.

I think it does little matter, as I was not able
to distinguish it BEFORE that time.

Yes, but how is it going to get there?

Except that I have to, before posting any Official Act, ensure that I
am doing so in a manner consistent with the law.  For example, I have
to ensure that I do not violate Rule 1023's ordering requirements.
Discussion I can do without research.

It might have taken me less time to type the message you suggest, but
when you add in the time it takes to ensure that I can legally do so,
it takes longer.

Since my message was posted within the lawfully mandated time of the
end of the Nominating Period, I contend that you have no basis for
complaint.  If the circumstances bother you this much, I suggest you
seek to amend the Election Rules such that the results of an Election
are not effective until announced, rather than jumping down my throat
for a reasonable and legal delay in posting the results.

As far as I can tell, the only way that P-Note will ever get back into
circulation is for us to adopt Rules that restrict who can own
Currency.  That, or for something to give that P-Note an Executor.
