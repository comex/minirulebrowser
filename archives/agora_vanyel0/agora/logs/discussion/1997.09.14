I don't see the first paragraph as awkward.  If anything, the second paragraph
could be replaced with "When an entity transfers at least 4 VTs to the Mint
for the sole purpose of buying a Plot owned by the Mint, that entity becomes
the Owner of that Plot".

Maybe.

Amend the random-Indulgence-allocation Rule.  Gets rid of the legal deeming,
but loses the quality of having the concept all in one place.  I don't think
it's worth it.

Yes, it was.  Apologies for not crediting the various and sundry authors of

Could the following work ? Well, it might be worth a try.

(Proto) Proposal :
---
Amend Rule 693 to read :

      The prescribed Voting Period for a Proposal is ten days,
      beginning at the time the Proposal is distributed to all
      Players.
---

I hereby prescribe for the above Proposal a Voting Period that ends 
in ten days or whenever Quorum has been met on that Proposal, 
whichever is sooner. I Vote FOR, etc.

As Assessor, I am holding that this does not affect the Voting Periods
of Proposals already made.  It seems reasonable to me that the Voting
Periods of these Proposals was established when they were distributed.

Now, the Voting Period of any Proposal made while Rule 693 remains
infected is open to question.  I believe I shall interpret such
Proposals to have an indefinite Voting Period; Guillotines will be
needed to end Voting on such Proposals.

I note that the Voting Period of Emergency Proposals is not affected,
so if you want to make sure your Proposal will be Voted upon, make it
an Emergency Proposal. :)

I think I agree, with a caveat: this is true only because 693 now
makes no claim one way or another about a Proposal's VP.  If,
instead, it had been amended to something like "The prescribed
voting period of a Proposal is 21 days,..." without the current
viral sentence, I believe that would be effective in changing
the VP of Proposals already up for vote.

Considering the voting on recent proposals, I don't think that

I just got this idea for introducing "the Australian system"...
I am not sure if I am satisfied with the wording, but you get the idea.

Proto-Proposal
Australian Elections

Create a Rule with the following text:

      A Player failing to Vote or declare Presence on every
      Proposal, distributed in a given Nomic Week, from which e is
      not excused, commits the Infraction of Voting for the Sofa
      Party, with a Penalty of 1 Voting Token and to be reported by
      the Assessor.

      A Player is excused from a Proposal if and only if e was On
      Hold during the entire Voting Period of that Proposal.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

How about "Any Entity which possesses a Plot may transfer ownership of that 
Plot to any other Entity"?

"A player may purchase a Plot owned by the Bank by transferring at least 4 
VTs to the Bank for the sole purpose of purchasing that Plot."

Change the Indulgence-assigning rule to create a list of all Players, then have the Church rule 
add a Player's name onto the list an additional two times for each Church they own.

When you propose it, you could include provisions to have new Rules or amendments be credited to 
their original authors, or to list "Murphy et al." as the author.

I'm afraid I'll need a crash course on this whole PC thing -- not being a Recordkeepor, I haven't 
been paying as close attention to the big debates and problems as I should have, and I'm still a 
bit hazy on a few things...

With either wording, shouldn't it be clarified whether the Entity/Owner 
needs the other entity's permission to transfer? With the first wording, 
clearly not; with the second wording, probably not but it should be 
clarified. I'm just jumping in here with no background in this; is this 
intentional?

The system was 'balanced' for mines to have an upkeep, so eliminating 
the upkeep for mines might cause there to be too much stuff 
available. Of course, if there are signifigantly less than three 
plots/Player, there might not be enough stuff available. (Stuff is 
VTs & P-Notes.)
