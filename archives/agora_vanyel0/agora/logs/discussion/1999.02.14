This seems a weak argument to me. We only have two or three
proposals distributed per week...surely Agora's combined creative
output is sufficient to fill that quota even without such 
Proposals. Actually, I think many proposals (particularly those
recently) have been passing unanimously because of the high cost
of voting. In fact, the more unanimous proposals there are, the
less valuable VTs become, since votes are less likely to have
decisive effect.
 And if you still think it would jeopardize the VT
economy, you can always demand bribes in VTs not to Object. That
would keep their value up.

Steve doesn't go for half measures.  Too bad.  Now he's made a

I think this is accurate.  People don't vote unless they have strong
feelings on a Proposal, are bribed, or are forced to vote to avoid a
penalty for not voting.  Steve wants to protect this status quo, for
reasons that are unclear to me; I don't see the merits in the current
regime.

I don't have a "political problem".  I don't care enough about these
Proposals to put any great effort into getting them adopted.  It costs 
me almost nothing to continually repropose them.  If you're hoping
that, by being a stick in the mud, you will encourage me to play
political games, you will fail, and Agora will become even more
stagnant than it is now.

Reformat Rule 402

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 402 be amended to read:

      Speaker Transition is a process which commences at the time the
      Rules call for a Speaker Transition to occur, and which proceeds
      as follows:

      (a) when the Speaker Transition commences, the Speaker loses all
          special rights and privileges that accrue to em as a result
          of being Speaker;

      (b) as soon as possible after the Speaker Transition commences,
          the Registrar shall post to the Public Forum a Notice of
          Speaker Transition, identifying the reason for the
          Transition and the Player who held the Office of
          Speaker-Elect at the time the Transition commenced;

      (c) provided that the Notice of Speaker Transition is correct in
          its particulars, the posting of the Notice causes the Player
          identified in it to cease being the Speaker-Elect and to
          become the Speaker. This concludes the process of Speaker
          Transition.

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1378 be amended to read:

      (a) A single Kudo shall be transferred from one Player (the
          "Victim") to a second Player (the "Beneficiary") when a
          Player (the "Transferer") sends a message to the Herald
          indicating that e is transferring a Kudo from the Victim to
          the Beneficiary, and all the following conditions hold:
        (1) the Transferer has not, during the current Nomic Week,
            previously caused two or more Kudo transfers;
        (2) the Transferer is not the same Player as the Beneficiary;
        (3) the Transferer has not, during the current Nomic Week,
            previously transferred a Kudo away from the Victim or to
            the Beneficiary;
        (4) the Victim has at least one Kudo; and
        (5) the message contains a justification for the transfer.

Why, the ruleset is of course an axiomatic system.

For this reason, what I did in Spring Cleaning (with one lazy exception)
was to make sure to include the relevant old text for every Rule.

In fact, one Rule did manage to move away, so maybe if someone has a
bundle of trivial fixes, they might include the Spring Cleaning part for
Rule 951 (now 1868).

Greetings,
Ørjan, who managed to get his network card working again (knock on wood)
and so is back sooner than expected.

This is an interesting proposal, peekee, but I'll note that
you and I are the only non-Senators in the game, and you'll
be one in a week or so. Perhaps you should reconsider the
definition of Senator.
