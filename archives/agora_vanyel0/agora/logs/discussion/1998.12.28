I like the first part of this proto. This reward really shouldn't be
automatic. 

I'm not so sure about the second part. A new source of VTs, hmm... Add
up many small VT sources like this and you'll end up with VT
inflation. Maybe the Rulekeepor should be allowed to pay out one or
two P-notes a month for proposals e likes? This additional P-note
circulation would be balanced by the fewer repeal-award P-notes paid
out.
