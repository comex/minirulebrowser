Though I suppose if Vir has only cast 1 vote so far, he could (now that he
is a Senator) cast another.

That wasn't possible when the Rule was created.  Pragmatic Currencies
should probably have made this change.

I'm glad to see the feeling is mutual.

Now let's see if I can get this right...

I hereby indicate willingness to succeed Crito as Herald.

I hereby vacate any Payment Orders in the range POI001 through
POI273, with the exception of POI127 and POI130, that Rule 1743 
requires to be vacated.

I hereby resign as Herald, appointing Crito to be my successor, if 
willing.

I feel this is a reasonable Judgement, and consistent with the Judicial
precedent set by Michael in his recent Judgement on whether a VT can
possess another VT.

I would add that a nickname is not necessary. You can be known as 'Tim'
if you like. It is worth noting that Watchers, and other non-Players,
can make Calls For Judgement. As Crito says, most other things, you need
to be a Player to do.

<nomic@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au> is also a Backup list, and is also 
designated a Public Forum. Therefore, subscription to that list also
required of Players.

My feeling is that 15-20 messages would be a pretty quiet day.

I take it this is an abbreviation in the sense of Rule 754.

I believe this fails the criterion of "no ambiguity in meaning." There are
bound to be many of these lines that are ambiguous. For example,

"KOJEN HEREBY DOT DECLARE PRESENCE ON PROPOSAL THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED
AND NINET."

Is "DOT" a misspelling of "DONT" or of "DOTH"? Is "NINET" a misspelling of
"NINE" or of "NINETY"?

"Entity" is used in the Rules precisely when you don't want to limit to
Nomic Entities. In particular, Players are not Nomic Entities (since they
have discernible existence without the Rules, being persons.)

You may even note the use of "entity" in the definition of "Nomic Entity",
which is not meant to be a circular definition.

It may the point, but it is not strongly enough phrased to achieve this
completely - it merely regulates the legality of actions, not their
effects. I think a (very) hypothetical Rule like the following: 

"Any CFJ which was called by a woman shall be dismissed"

would not be against the letter of Rule 1700.

There are a couple of underlying arguments which I didn't think of
including, to the effect that Game State Changes cannot take effect in
that way.

First, since there is no Rule positively removing EiP-hood, I maintain
that 1011 (as well as Game Custom) prohibits it from being removed. 

Secondly, in general, I do not believe it is custom in Agora to allow
logical Reductiones ad Absurdum such as the above to create effects. In
particular, there is long-standing game custom that paradoxes in the Rules
do not cause Agora to break down, as would be the case if we used the
logical rule (tautology) "contradiction => anything"

Agora's internal logic is a positive logic, and so a positive requirement
is needed, not just a deduction from "if this didn't happen then we would
have a contradiction".

Greetings,
Ørjan.

Looks good to me.  If anyone knows any reason why R1743 would
not have repealed itself as of Morendil's PF message, please
let me know.

I should be OK as long as I wait until after I've published the Nominations
to publish the Registrar's Report.

Has anyone ever been called for violating the ordering requirement in
R1023?

A most curious defence of your Judgement, Oerjan. I didn't argue,
exactly, that if Elde is Blob's Executor then we have a contradiction. 
I argued rather that Elde's being Blob's Executor would be in
contravention of the Rules.

But I see from another of your posts that you've Gone Mad...:)

Then what about the underlying question: is Plato an entity?

Um, you must have missed the distribution of 3 Nov 1997, which

distribution.

I haven't seen it distributed. Have I missed it, or has the CotC 
missed it, or does the CotC have a backlog?

And for good cause.  Legal systems are rarely logically consistent,

principles come into conflict.

There's even a term for a combination of contradictory laws:
"antinomy".

More importantly, is Plato an entity who reasonably can be held to be
