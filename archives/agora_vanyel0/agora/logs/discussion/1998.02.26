My apologies for the MIME business; unfortunately, my mail software
mangles blank lines when importing text.  (I'll transfer a Kudo to the
first player to tell me how to fix this, other than switching software.)

Note that the reward created by this rule is to be determined and paid
out "ASAP after a Proposal has been determined to have passed by the
narrowest of margins", and it is not necessary that the award rule
(just created by P3694) existed when the proposal was made, voted on
or even passed.

In fact, I wonder whether this rule shouldn't really be applied to all
proposals ever made (implying a failure to apply it ASAP, of course)?

Well, I don't do anything until the decision is made.  If it comes out

It is perhaps a shame, but P3694 did not pass by the narrowest of
margins. For that, you have to have had at least one vote AGAINST.

     A shame, yes.  That would have been a nice debut for this Rule. 
Also, it appears that I mistakenly didn't pay a P-Note to make it
Interested.  So I don't get anything -- not even the 3 VTs for
passing an (Interested) Proposal within my Grace Period.  :~(

Unless I read it wrong, I think you missed the point.  He was saying
that EVERY proposal up till this point may be under the jurisdiction
of this rule; i.e. any rule that ever passed by the narrowest of
margins should be given a reward now.

Hm. The Rules about Disinterestedness changed while your Proposal
was being voted on. The new R1623/10 makes a Proposal Disinterested
only if its text explicitly makes it so. I wonder if that means that
your Proposal was Interested after all?

My advice is to ask Oerjan; he's explicitly stated that he intends
to use his filthy lucre for charitable causes.

I will resist both. I like having free, indelible Election voting. 
It is interesting to have two different systems, Proposals and Elections,
and to explore the dynamics of each. I also think that Election voting
should be free in order to avoid completely disenfranchising poor players.
