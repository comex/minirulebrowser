Several people have done this before.  Does this mean we have Game Custom
to the contrary, or that we have a Crisis? :-)

Before, the player has always specified a time range, e.g., "I
make myself ineligible to judge any CFJ called between <time1>
and <time2>."  I don't know how much of a difference it
makes when no time range is specified.

IMHO, Game Custom cannot override the Rules.  In this case the Rules seem
quite clear that this sort of move is not allowed.  It would seem to be a
crisis.

While the time makes the move more specific, it still fails to name specific
CFJs.  I don't think it makes any difference at all.

Interestingly, I noticed this discrepancy between the Rules and how the game
is played about 2 weeks ago.  I was planning to make myself ineligible to
Judge (I wanted to give myself some time to review the Rules before
Judging), but after looking at the Rules I realized that I couldn't.  I
seemed to remember others having done it in the past but I assumed that
either I was mistaken or the Rule had been changed since I last saw it done.
Until this incident, it had actually slipped my mind.
