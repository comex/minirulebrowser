I say that it does make it invalid.  I'll announce that Steve has won
the Election by acclamation shortly.

Thanks for pointing this out,

This was not a legal Nomination, so I should have ignored it, and I
have now effectively done so.

Ah, correct - I have looked up the relevant Rule now. Though you

sent that in, but had overlooked Rule 1647; isn't one of these two
Rules redundant, by the way ?

Why?  I think it's clear that "replaing" is a typo for "replacing".
Rule 754 should apply.

I am surprized to see that Morendil's nomination has been cancelled,
or ignored, as illegal by Michael. Clearly, Morendil sent "a message
to the Vote Collector during the Nominations Period, indicating what
Election e is Nominating for." (Definition of Nominations, 1445). 

So instead of ignoring this illegal nomination, why don't we let it
stand and say that Morendil violated 1647 by nominating, as reported
by Blob? And, shouldn't Blob have reported the penalty for violating a
rule, whatever it is (1 blot because 1647 has power 1, or some such
thing)?

Ah, the tension between the pragmatic and the platonic interpretations.  When
the Rule doesn't define it specifically as a Crime, apparently we tend to take
a platonic interpretation of "may not", i.e. "may not" = "impossible".  You
might be able to get another spirited argument going over whether Morendil has
actually broken the Rule by attempting to nominate (a road I think we have
traveled before, but it might not be bad to take a trip down there for the
newer Players).  Maybe I should dust off my "Political Alignment" publication.

AFAICT Rule 1445 defers to Rule 1450, which means that attempting to
Nominate for S-E when one is already Justiciar simply has no legally
defined effects, rather than being an illegal move - which in turn
would mean that Michael was correct.

Thanks for the reply. I'm not sure I understand what 1450 has to do
with this, though. 1450 reads,

      The Speaker shall never hold either of the Office of Clerk of
      the Courts or the Office of Justiciar in the normal fashion.  If
      the Clerk of the Courts or the Justiciar becomes Speaker, e is
      immediately retired from whichever of those Offices e holds.

This refers to the Speaker, and to actually holding the office of
speaker. You tried to nominate for Speaker-Elect - you were only
nominating for, not holding an office; and the office in question was
S-E, not Speaker.

I believe that the reason that Morendil is not permitted to Nominate
is that he would be barred from holding the Office if elected.  And
there is a Judgement (written by me) that states that such Nominations
are facially void.  In my opinion, Michael's actions are consistent
with standing law.

I see that I'm not the only one who didn't remember about 1647. ;)

I'm prohibited from being Speaker, but there is no reason why I couldn't
be Speaker-Elect, by the way. 1647 is overkill, especially as 1450
requires
me to abandon Justiciar if I ever become Speaker, which I am quite
prepared
to do.

IMHO, it is an easily retractable move, and so our best recourse is
to consider that it never happened. I refer you to Steve's excellent
thesis on retractable and non-retractable moves.

There is only a penalty if a CFJ is found to be true (R1439). I see no
reason to make such a CFJ, since a) There is no ambiguity about whether 
or not the violation took place, and b) the violation was clearly not
deliberate, and Morendil does not deserve any kind of punishment.

On another issue, I agree with Morendil that 1647 is excessively strict.
There is no reason why the Justiciar should not also be the Speaker-Elect,
as long as e steps down from the former office before e becomes Speaker.

Michael was following up my post to n-b, in which I pointed out that 
your Nomination was illegal, so didn't bother rehashing the argument.
Did you not receive that message?
