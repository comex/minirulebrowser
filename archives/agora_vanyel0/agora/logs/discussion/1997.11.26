I noticed in Mad Scientist Oerjan's reports, he incremented the
Amendment Number of the Frankenstein Rule twice for each week.
I was about to post that this was incorrect, and that Game
Custom held that each week constituted only a single amendment.
But then I looked at R1673 to see if I could find something
stronger than Game Custom to back me up...and I found
that Oerjan was right, after all:

Rule 1673/3 (Power=1)
The Frankenstein Mutator

[...]
      Once a week the following Rule Changes shall occur to the
      Frankenstein Rule:
[...]
      The Mad Scientist shall make the above selections as soon as
      possible after the beginning of each Nomic Week.  E shall
      publish the resulting Rule Changes in the Public Forum within 24
      hours after these selections are made.

Note the use of the plural--Rule Changes--here.  And in both
cases, it is referring to the changes made in a single week,
not changes in general.  Thus I conclude that Rule 1673/3 is
clear that two Amendments occur each week to the FR (if
it has 10 or more sentences between the first and last
paragraph.)

This means that the history and Amendment Number of R1671 are
incorrect.  In order to correct it, I request the text of
the following proposals from anyone who has them:

P2754
P2774
P3502
P3532

(OK, P3532 isn't strictly necessary since it amended the FR
to its current form, but it would be nice to have it.)

(Alternately, if people have back Rulesets and could send
me 1673/0, 1673/1, and 1673/2, that would work too.)

In order to correctly determine the history and AN of the
Frankenstein Rule, I need to reconstruct previous forms
of R1673, and consider two issues:
  * Are previous forms of R1673 equally clear about each
    weekly procedure constituting two Rule Changes?
  * In previous forms of R1673, if no deletion was necessary,
    did that constitute a null amendment or no amendment at
    all?  (In the current form, it is no amendment at all,
    but that may not apply to previous forms.  I do recall
    that early versions of the FM required >10 sentences
    rather than the current >=10 sentences between the
    first and last paragraph for a deletion, so 1673 would
    have been applied 11 times, not 10, without a deletion.)

I don't have the records themselves, but the following may prove helpful
in digging them up: the history of R1671.  Please note (1) this does
not include your recent amendments, and (2) this still uses the
old, incorrect counting of amendments (wherein each weekly

Bleergh.

Absurdly scammable. What about the following: I make a large number of 
Proposals, all with the same text. I secretly choose one of these Proposals,
make a Quorum buyback to 1, and cast 2 or 3 votes FOR. Unless the Assessor 
starts electioneering, I have a very good chance that this Proposal will
pass, even with a text like

"Let the following Rule be created with an AI of 4:

 Andre is the Great Dictator. The Great Dictator may change the Rules in
 any way he wishes at any time by declaring that he does so in the Public
 Forum."

> PROTO3: Quorum without objection

Will probably mostly be a dead letter. Only useful if there are many Players
who are not playing and yet count towards Quorum. With Deregistration due
to Absency present this will not happen.

The phrase 'a == b (mod n)' means 'a and b are equal modulo n', not
'a modulo n equals b'.

Then again, Oerjan did have an opportunity, just a few minutes
later, to make Voting possible again, by choosing to delete that
sentence from the Frankenstein Rule - if e had so chosen, Rule 1698
would have been satisfied.

3502 doesn't seem to have anything to do with the FM.
But I've included it anyway. I think it's 3503 you wanted,
which is here too. Oerjan, this partly satsifies your request,
I suppose - more to follow.

Proposal 2754 by Swann (disinterested)
The Frankenstein Monster v3.1

This is intended to fix whatever the conditional clauses
in the prior proposal broke. (Avoiding the question of 
partial-passage by only adopting those Frankenstein Rules
that are actually missing in the Ruleset.)

============================================================

If no Rule known as the Frankenstein Rule exists,
then Let The Following Rule Be created with an MI = 1;
(Title: The Frankenstein Rule.)

     There is a Nomic Entity known as a Frankenstein Monster.  A
     Frankenstein Monster only has properties and effects as defined in
     this Rule.  This Rule shall be known as the Frankenstein Rule, and
     can be referred to unambiguously in that manner.  This is the first
     paragraph.

     This is the last paragraph. This Rule can only be subject to a Rule 
     Change as described by the Frankenstein Generator.  This Rule takes 
     precedence over all other Rules that would otherwise allow this 
     Rule to be changed in any manner whatsoever.

{Comment:  The Embryo Monster :)  The odd wording results from the way
     these Rules refer to each other, and also from the necessity of 
     making the first and last paragraphs unambiguous wherever violence 
     is done to this Rule.  The strong precedence clause prevents the 
     normal amending process, since I believe most of the proposal Rules 
     are MI=1.  BTW, the use of an indefinite article is to allow the
     possibility of an amendment such as, "There are exactly n FMs."}
===========================================================

If no Rule known as the Frankenstein Generator exists,
then Let the following Rule be created with an MI = 1;
(Title: The Frankenstein Generator)

     This Rule shall be known as the Frankenstein Generator, and can be 
     referred to unambiguously in that manner.  This Rule specifies the 
     only ways in which the Frankenstein Rule can undergo a Rule Change.

     Rule Changes to the Frankenstein Rule must conform to the following 
     restrictions:

       i) The Frankenstein Rule cannot be repealed.

      ii) No Rule Change can add text to the Frankenstein Rule unless it 
          adds that text between the first and last paragraphs of the 
          Rule.

     iii) No Rule Change can alter, add, or remove text from the first 
          or last paragraphs of the Frankenstein Rule.

      iv) If the Frankenstein Rule explicitly forbids a specific
          property or effect to the Frankenstein Monster, no Rule Change
          can be adopted that grants the Frankenstein Monster that 
          property or effect. (Deletion of the language forbidding that
          property or effect does not grant that property or effect.)

       v) If the Frankenstein Rule explicitly grants a specific property 
          or effect to the Frankenstein Monster, no Rule Change can be
          adopted that denies the Frankensein Monster that property or
          effect.  (Deletion of the language granting that property or
          effect does not deny that property or effect.)

      vi) No Amendment can be applied to the Frankenstein Rule that is 
          substantially the same as any prior successfully applied
          Amendment to the Frankenstein Rule.

     vii) All proposed Amendments to the Frankenstein Rule must consist
          of a single sentence of additional text specifying the
          properties and effects of a Frankenstein Monster, to be
          inserted between the first and last paragraphs. No proposed
          Amendment changing existing text beyond such an insertion
          shall be applied to the Frankenstein Rule, and no other
          proposed Rule Changes shall be applied to the Frankenstein
          Rule.

    viii) Whenever a Win by Pitchfork is legally announced by the Mad
          Scientist, all text between the first and last paragraphs of
          the Frankenstein Rule shall be deleted from the Frankenstein
          Rule.

      ix) Any Non-proposed Rule Changes not specified in this Rule, can 
          only be applied to the Frankenstein Rule by the Frankenstein
          Mutator, as described by that Rule.

       x) The Frankenstein Rule shall have neither Amendment Numbers,
          nor Mandatory Rule Annotations. This Rule takes precedence
          over those Rules which would apply them to the Frankenstein
          Rule.

     No Rule Changes are permitted to this Rule that would alter, in any 
     way, the restrictions this Rule makes on the Rule Changes that can 
     be applied to the Frankenstein Rule.  This Rule takes precedence
     over any Rule permitting Rule Changes to the Frankenstein Rule
     other than those described in this Rule, and over any Rule that
     would permit Rule Changes forbidden by this Rule.

{Comment: In the normal course of events, Players can add but not
     subtract words from the Frankenstein Rule, and every new Amendment
     adds qualities to the Monster.  Also note that this Rule only calls
     for self-consistency, not consistency with the Rules. Of course,
     getting around all the precedence claims is yet another part of the
     game.  A really robust version of this Rule would be MI=2 or
     higher, (opposed to the Frankenstein Rule, which I'd only see as
     interesting-- not to mention safer-- at MI=1) but I don't know if
     that is strictly necessary.
     v2: Followed Steve's suggestion partway.  The Monster can be
     paradoxical and inconsistent.  Instead of the prior iv, there's 
     now the restrictions of iv,v,vi,& vii.  I've also added a Mad 
     Scientist to keep track of everything w/o overloading the 
     Rulekeepor.  Also eliminated Amendment Numbers and Rule Annotations
     from the Frankenstein Rule, otherwise it would quicky become as
     overloaded as the Conest Rule.
     v3: All the non-Rule Change elements of this Rule were put in their
     own Rules. Made it MI=2.}

==============================================================

If no Rule known as the Frankenstein Mutator exists,
then Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: The Frankenstein Mutator)

     This Rule shall be known as the Frankenstein Mutator, and can be 
     referred to unambiguously in that manner.  This Rule specifies the 
     way in which the Frankenstein Rule shall undergo non-proposed Rule 
     Changes.  All Rule Changes mandated by this Rule shall be subject 
     to the restrictions that the Frankenstein Generator makes on Rule 
     Changes in general.

     Once a week the following Rule Changes shall occur to the
     Frankenstein Rule:

      i) If there are more than ten sentences between the first and last 
         paragraphs of the Frankenstein Rule, then one of those
         sentences, selected by the Mad Scientist at random, shall be
         deleted from the Rule for every ten sentences between the first
         and last paragraphs of the Frankenstein Rule.

    ii) One sentence shall be inserted between the first and last 
        paragraph of the Frankenstein Rule in the following manner;
        1) The Mad Scientist selects a Rule, at random, from among all
           Rules in the Ruleset.
        2) The Mad Scieist shall select any one complete sentence e 
           wishes from within the randomly selected Rule.
        3) The Mad Scientist shall select any noun (which can be a
           compound of two or more words) e wishes from within the
           selected sentence.
        4) The Mad Scientist shall replace each instance of the selected 
           noun with the noun, "Frankenstein Monstr." (Or its plural,
           possessive, or other, form if appropriate.)
        5) As long as the resulting sentence conforms to the 
           restrictions that the Frankenstein Generator makes upon
           proposed Amendments, the sentence shall be inserted, at any
           point the Mad Scientist wishes, between the first and last
           paragraphs of the Frankenstein Rule.

     The Mad Scientist shall make the above selections as soon as
     possible after the beginning of each Nomic Week.  E shall publish
     the resulting Rule Changes in the Public Forum within 24 hours
     after these selections are made.

{Comment: A guarantee that the Monster will not stagnate, and also 
     introducing a wild slice of chaos to the monster.  This Rule, by 
     itself, will top out at generating ten sentences, at which point 
     the deletion mechanism cuts in.
     v2: Made a Mad Scientist to oversee this duty.} 
==============================================================
If no Rule with the Title "The Mad Scientist" exists,
then Let the following Rule be created with MI = 1;
(Title: The Mad Scientist)

     There is the Office of Mad Scientist.  The Mad Scientist has the 
     duty of the oversight of the Frankenstein Rules and the 
     Frankenstein Monster.

     The Mad Scientist shall keep a Record of all successfully applied 
     Proposed Amendments to the Frankenstein Rule, their Proposal 
     Numbers, and the identity of the Entities who Proposed them.  E 
     shall keep a record of all successfully applied non-proposed Rule 
     Changes to the Frankenstein Rule.  And E shall also record the 
     number of sentences between the first and last paragraphs of the 
     Frankenstein Rule.

     The Mad Scientist shall determine whenever a Proposed Rule Change 
     is eligible to be applied to the Frankenstein Rule or the
     Frankenstein Generator. If a Proposed Rule Change, in the Mad 
     Scientist's estimation, cannot be applied, e shall identify it in 
     the Public Forum as soon as possible after it is distributed, and 
     identify and document the reason why the Proposed Rule Change 
     cannot be applied.

     The Mad Scientist shall post, in the Public Forum, any non-proposed 
     Rule Changes to the Frankenstein Rule as soon as possible after 
     they occur.

     The first Mad Scientist shall be Swann, this sentence shall delete
     itself once Swann becomes Mad Scientist.

{Comment:  Moved all the reporting requirements here from the
     Frankenstein Generator.  These specifications should be more 
     mutable than the Generator, which now only concerns itself with the 
     changes the FR can undergo, not with its maintenance.}

==============================================================
If no Rule with the Title, "Pitchfork-Wielding Angry Villagers" exists,
then Let the following Rule be created with MI = 1;
(Title: Pitchfork-Wielding Angry Villagers)

     There is a Win known as a Win by Pitchfork, and a Patent Title of 
     Angry Villager, both are awarded as follows:

     When a CFJ finds that, at some specified time, all proposed 
     Amendments to the Frankenstein Rule were made impossible by the
     Frankenstein Generator, the last Player (Other than the
     Mad Scientist or the Angry Villager) to have Proposed a
     successfully applied Amendment to the Frankenstein Rule, prior
     to the time specified in the CFJ, shall Win by Pitchfork-- provided
     that e has not before Won by Pitchfork for the Amendment in
     question.

     The Mad Scientist shall report such a Win as soon as possible 
     after it occurs.

     When a Win by Pitchfork is legally announced by the Mad Scientist, 
     the Player who Won by Pitchfork shall be awarded the Title of Angry 
     Villager, and the last Player (if any) to hold the Title shall 
     cease to hold it. The Patent Title of Angry Villager shall be 
     awarded without need for a directive, only as specified in this 
     Rule.

{Comment: Moved all the provisions for winning here from the Franenstein
     Generator.}

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 2774 by Chuck (AI=1)
Refine Frankenstein

This Proposal contains 3 proposed Rule Changes and no Directives.

I. Rule 1672 shall be amended by deleting the text that reads:

        x) The Frankenstein Rule shall have neither Amendment Numbers,
           nor Mandatory Rule Annotations. This Rule takes precedence
           over those Rules which would apply them to the Frankenstein
           Rule.

[I'm not sure what the point of this was.  If it was to make life
 easier on the Rulekeepor, then I appreciate the thought, but it's
 easier for me if all Rules are treated the same.  If it's to keep
 the Ruleset shorter, that is a problem which needs to be addressed
 generally and not one Rule at a time.]

II. Rule 1673 shall be amended by changing the text that currently
reads:

         4) The Mad Scientist shall replace each instance of the
            selected noun with the noun, "Frankenstein Monstr." (Or
            its plural, possessive, or other, form if appropriate.)

to read:

         4) The Mad Scientist shall replace each instance of the
            selected noun with the noun "Frankenstein Monster". (Or
            its plural, possessive, or other form if appropriate.)

[Corrects the spelling, and removes a few wayward commas.]

III. Rule 1674 shall be amended by deleting the text that reads:

      The Mad Scientist shall determine whenever a Proposed Rule
      Change is eligible to be applied to the Frankenstein Rule or
      the Frankenstein Generator. If a Proposed Rule Change, in the
      Mad Scientist's estimation, cannot be applied, e shall identify
      it in the Public Forum as soon as possible after it is
      distributed, and identify and document the reason why the
      Proposed Rule Change cannot be applied.

[Why should the Mad Scientist be the sole arbiter of what Rule Changes
 can be applied and what can't?  Let any disputes be resolved by CFJ,
 just like any other issue.]
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 3502 (General Chaos) (probably Disinterested)
Extend the Mint

This Proposal creates the Office of the Chancellor, who keeps track of
what Currencies exist, and extends the power to Mint Currencies to
every Player.  Group Coins are repealed, but since Groups already have
Mint Authority (and this Authority is retained), Groups who want Coins
can recreate them.  Contests also gain the ability to Mint Coins.  The
AI of this Proposal is 1.

1. Be it therefore resolved, that a Rule be created with title 
"The Chancellor" containing the text:

      There shall exist the Office of Chancellor.

      The Chancellor shall retain a schedule, listing every Currency
      which exists, detailing for each Currency the Name, Mintor,
      Recordkeepor, and MUQ of that Currency.  This schedule shall be
      posted to the Public Forum by the Chancellor at least once in
      each Month.

2. Be it further resolved, that a new Rule be created with the title
"Minting of Currencies":

      A new Currency is created when an entity which has Mint
      Authority posts to the Public Forum a message stating that e is
      doing so, provided that also e states in that message the values
      of all properties which the Rules require of Currencies.  The
      Mintor of a Currency created in this way is the entity which
      created it, any specification to the contrary notwithstanding.
      If the Recordkeepor of the Currency to be created is not the
      Executor of the Mintor, the proposed Recordkeepor must first
      consent to being its Recordkeepor before the Currency is
      created.

      A Currency is destroyed when Mintor of that Currency posts in
      the Public Forum stating that e is doing so, unless this
      destruction would be prohibited by the Rules.

      The Mintor of a Currency may not destroy that Currency if that
      Currency exists by virtue of being required to exist by the
      Rules.

      The Recordkeepor of a Currency created by the procedure in this
      Rule is changed when the Mintor of that Currency announces the
      change; but if the new Recordkeepor is not the Executor of the
      Mintor, the new Recordkeepor must first consent to being made
      Recordkeepor.

2. Be it further resolved, that Rule 1620 be repealed.

3. Be it further resolved, that Rule 766 be amended, by appending the
paragraph:

      Each Group has Mint Authority.

4. Be it further resolved, that Rule 1446 be amended, by appending the
paragraph:

      Each Contest has Mint Authority.

5. Be it further resolved, that Rule 1579 be amended, by appending the
paragraph:

      Each Player has Mint Authority.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 3503 (Chuck) (probably Disinterested)
Give the Mad Scientist a Little More Control

I request an AI of 1 for this Proposal.

Rule 1673 shall be amended by replacing the text which reads:

       i) If there are more than ten sentences between the first and
          last paragraphs of the Frankenstein Rule, then one of those
          sentences, selected by the Mad Scientist at random, shall be
          deleted from the Rule for every ten sentences between the
          first and last paragraphs of the Frankenstein Rule.

with the text:

       i) If there are at least ten sentences between the first and
          last paragraphs of the Frankenstein Rule, then N of those
          sentences shall be deleted as follows.  Here, N is 1/10
          of the number of sentences between the first and last
          paragraphs of the Frankenstein Rule prior to the deletion,
          rounded down to the nearest integer.
          1) The Mad Scientist shall randomly select 2N different
             sentences from those between the first and last
             paragraphs of the Frankenstein Rule.
          2) The Mad Scientist shall choose N of the sentences
             selected in step i.1, and those sentences shall be
             deleted from the Frankenstein Rule.

[The sentences in the FR vary widely in what they add to the game.
Some are rather silly and don't really affect the game much.
Others are good, and I hate to see them go.  For instance, we
really didn't get to explore having the FM as quasi-Liaison, and
I really liked having the FM as an office.  This gives the MS
a little choice in which sentence gets deleted.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 3532 (General Chaos) (Disinterested)
Flight of the Spelling Bee

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1580 be amended, to replace the
word "acheive" with the word "achieve".

Be it further resolved, that Rules 911, 1447, 1457, and 1573 be
amended, by replacing the word "eim" with the word "em".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 681 be amended, by replacing the
word "eimself" with the word "emself".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1672 be amended, by replacing the
word "Injuction" with the word "Injunction".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1669 be amended, by replacing the
word "isequired" with the words "is required", and by replacing the
word "recor" with the word "record", and by replacing the word "shal"
with the word "shall".

Be it further resolved, that Rules 1647 and 1665 be amended, by
replacing the word "precidence" with the word "precedence".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1673 be amended, by replacing the
word "Scieist" with the word "Scientist".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1667 be amended, by replacing the
word "theInitial" with the words "the Initial".

Be it further resolved, that the Rulekeepor be encouraged to hum "The
Flight of the Bumblebee" while updating the Rules to reflect the
effects of this Proposal's adoption.

Eeeh... 3513's Voting Period has been over for ages. I guess you mean

This flies in the face of a long-standing game principle, namely that if
the Rules and Game Custom do not give special meaning to a word, it should
be interpreted according to its ordinary RL meaning.

Crito asks:

I would also deny that Plato is "legally deemed" to possess things
possessed by his estate.  This is simply not true in RL.

Legal deeming has its basis in law.  To accept as "legally deemed" a
statement that was not (strictly speaking) true, I would have to see what
Rules deem it to be true. I don't see any in this case. I would judge FALSE.


>2.  Given current Reports and the fact that I have never received a package of
>poker chips or any other objects purported to be Voting Tokens from an
>Assessor, how would you have judged the statement, "David Albertz possesses at
>least .9 VTs"?

The word "possesses", not being given any special meaning by the Rules or
Game Custom, must be interpreted in its ordinary meaning of having the
legal right of interest and control.  You don't need to see and touch
something to own it.

Evidently the Rules give you a right of interest in and control over 74.0
VTs: you can use them in legal game moves, and noone else has the right to
take them from you.  I would judge TRUE.

**

How about: "Zefram's attempted transfer of 0.9 VT to Plato had the effect
of transferring VTs to Plato's estate" ?

This is a question I would judge FALSE as a Judge, but perhaps I might let
an opposite Judgement stand. It would depend on the Judge's arguments.

I don't think that Plato's estate exists right now.  Estates are a matter
of law and are not immortal; some jurisdictions (such as Agora before the
Probate rules) do not even create estates.

(Obviously if we're interested in having an estate for Plato, we could
write Rules to create one. But we have not done so, unless Plato has
recently de-registered.  :-)

It's hard to see where it ends.  "I transfer 0.9 VTs to King Arthur of
Camelot"?  "I transfer 0.9 VTs to Sir John Falstaff"?  "I transfer 0.9 VTs
to the Man in the Moon"?

It is, indeed, an extremely poor PRNG, most likely a 32-bit linear
congruential PRNG.  The first number generated essentially has the same
randomness as the seed (almost certainly the time in seconds, so not great
-- zsh uses microseconds and so is a bit better).  Each subsequent number
generated is completely non-random; no new entropy enters the system,
and all the entropy of the initial seed was used up in the first one or
two numbers generated.  I doubt that this system could be construed as
satisfying the Rules' requirement of randomness.

If you have access to a Linux machine, I suggest you use /dev/random --
bytes read from it are all random and independent, and it's careful to
make sure it doesn't give you more bits than the entropy it has available.

Failing that, you can use your physical dice.  If they are unacceptably
biased, there is an algorithm to unbias them.  Use the dice to generate
a biased but random sequence of bits.  Take bits from this sequence in
pairs; if the bits are the same, discard this pair, otherwise use the
first of them as part of the unbiased random bit stream.

You shouldn't be using the word 'entropy' in the presence of the Mad
Scientist. If anything is likely to get em into a RANT, it's that
word. Don't you know that Mad Scientists just love entropy ?

(Morendil)
Then again, Oerjan did have an opportunity, just a few minutes
later, to make Voting possible again, by choosing to delete that
sentence from the Frankenstein Rule - if e had so chosen, Rule 1698
<<

But that was a random event that happened _after_ the potentially
dangerous change occurred. So the truth of Scott's remark (or the
effectiveness of the change to the FR) depends on events that happen
(or don't happen) after this change? Sounds like the paradox discussed
recently in the context of officer resignations: to assess the
validity of an event you must know the future...

Of course, in this case 1698 doesn't trigger anyway because 1671
doesn't have precedence over 206.

I think you misread the Proto, each Player is only allowed to buyback once
per Proposal.

In essence, this allows a Player to pay to count twice towards Quorum.
Maybe that would be a better way to phrase it, as well.

First, thank you for your response.  I think this answers my question in the
affirmative - that a judge *should* consider "legally deemed" facts to be true
when rendering a judgement.

However, I think we may be obscuring things by using words like "legal deeming"
and "legal fiction", to which you seem to be attaching a narrow, RL legal
definition.  I have always considered these terms to be just fancy ways of
saying that certain fictions are created in the Agora game state and given
legitimacy by the Rules.  Your point here then seems to be that such a fiction
can only be treated as true if it is specified directly in a Rule.  I would
argue that such a fiction must also be treated as true if it has been created
indirectly by a mechanism defined within the Rules.  I consider TOs to be such
a mechanism.  So I would say, if you were looking for a Rule which deemed
Plato's possession of .9 VTs to be true, you only have to look at R1598, which
gives Zefram's TO the legal force necessary to create this new fiction.

This is clear.  This seems to fit in with Chuck's (I hope I have the
attribution right) idea of "strong" and "weak" possession, where "strong"
implies that the owner has legal right of interest and control plus the
capacity to exercise that right, and "weak" implies that the owner has the same
rights without the capacity to exercise them.  This "weak" version may seem
silly, but it is certainly possible - people have willed some of their property
to their pets.

>Evidently the Rules give you a right of interest in and control over 74.0
>VTs: you can use them in legal game moves, and noone else has the right to

It is not quite true that noone has the right to take them from me.  The other
Players collectively have the right to pass Rules that could take them from me,
and I could not prevent this.

This seems to me to be a different version of the argument that an entity must
be of a particular type to be the target of a transfer, one that has the
ability to exercise control over possessions (a living person) or one that has
a RL legally recognized capacity for ownership (something with an executor,
like an estate).  While I agree this is desirable, I think the Rules have let
us down in making this restriction.

True, it *is* hard to see where it ends (I think it should end in appropriately
drafted legislation).  Although I think Morendil has made an excellent case
that the target of a transfer probably cannot be a *fictitous* entity, since
the Rules don't explicitly give permission to create arbitrary fictitous
entities.  But that's another issue.  8)

I'll say! Is there any reason to think that in the absence of R1598,
any of us are capable of voting for the next two weeks?

I don't read R1698 that way. The argument runs that whether or not
the sentence *actually* gets deleted during the next 4 weeks, it
is *possible* that it may be deleted, and so *possible* for a
Rule Change to be adopted within 4 weeks.

If 'being a Frankenstein Monster' is a property that some Players
possess, then I have no difficulty with the idea that several
different Players may currently be Frankenstein Monsters. However,
if there is already a Nomic Entity called the Frankenstein Monster
(and I don't know whether there is or not), then the creation of
units of Currency called 'Frankenstein Monsters' threats to run afoul
of R1586:

      No two Nomic Entities (including Players) shall have the same
      name or nickname.

Is it? I'm surprised to hear you say so. If you thought Morendil made
an excellent case, then why didn't you deliver the Judgement that
Morendil's case was a case for, namely a Judgement of FALSE?

For the case of delayed, implicit Transfer Orders there is a lot explained
in Rule 1730 and 1731, and I believe that they together provide enough
redundancy to make Voting still work.

Neither of them explains what it means for a Transfer Order be
successfully executed, or what happens when a Transfer Order is
executed.  It is my opinion that in the absence of any legislative
defintion, it is impossible to execute a Transfer Order, and
impossible to transfer Currencies.  Neither Rule 1730 nor Rule 1731
(nor the two of these in concert) is sufficient to define any of these
things.

>======================================================================
>Judge:       Steve
>======================================================================

Some preliminary remarks are in order. Firstly, on the logical form
of the Statement: Immediately after event A occurred, event B occurred.
I take this as implying that event A actually did occur. Therefore,
among the matters to be considered is the question of whether Morendil
actually did become Speaker. If he did not, then the Statement would
be FALSE.

Secondly, on the use of the phrase 'immediately after'. There is some
temptation to think that if the Rules support the conclusion that
Morendil's becoming Speaker brought in its train his registration,
that these events happened, strictly speaking, at the same time, and
not one after the other. It might be argued that in that case, the
Statement is trivially FALSE. However, given our history of
interpreting some events as happening at the same time but in a
particular order, I'm inclined to allow the Caller some latitude in
this respect. If the Rules support the conlusion that Morendil did
become Speaker, and that he was registered as a result, in my view a
Judgement that the Statement is TRUE is indicated.

The first question to be considered, therefore, is whether Morendil
actually did become Speaker. A consensus seems have developed that he
did, but I think it is worth rehearsing, and putting on the Judicial
record, the arguments to that effect. These are, briefly, as follows:
R1445 states that "The Winner of the Election is the Candidate for
whom the most votes were cast." Morendil was a Candidate for the
Office of Speaker-Elect, and nothing in the Rules implies that he
ceased to be one when he was deregistered during the Voting Period.
He did receive the most votes in the Election, beating General Chaos
5-4, and was therefore the Winner of the Election. R790 states that
"The winner of [an] Election...hold[s] [the] Office until e resigns
or is retired or removed from that Office" and this Rule takes
precedence over R1006 which states that an Office must be held by a
Player.  Morendil therefore became the first non-Player ever to hold
Office, holding the Office of Speaker-Elect as of Oct. 17. A Revolt
occurred on Nov. 3, and in accordance with R1664, Morendil became
Speaker. Crucially, this was not blocked by R103, which states only
that "each Player shall be either a Voter or the Speaker; no Player
may simultaneously be a Voter and a Speaker." Since Morendil was not
a Player when he became Speaker, these provisions did not apply to
him and could not have been violated. This is sufficient to establish
that Morendil did indeed become Speaker.

We turn now to the second question, that of Morendil's registration. 
Although Morendil was not a Player when he became Speaker, his
becoming Speaker caused him to become a Player, or at least to be
deemed to be a Player for all legal purposes, which amounts to the
same thing. This is because R103 states that "The term "Player" in
the Rules shall specifically include...the Speaker." 

Now, the first paragraph of R869 states that:

      A Player is any person who is registered as a Player.
      A person is Registered to play when e sends a message to the
      Public Forum requesting Registration; this Rule defers to Rules
      which would prevent such a Registration.

My initial inclination was to take R103 as implying, in conjunction
with R869, that being the Speaker is a sufficient condition for being
registered as a Player. On further consideration, however, I am now
inclined to reject this view. Being registered is a Nomic Property
in the sense defined in R1011, and therefore cannot be changed
"except in accordance with procedures specified by the Rules". The
second sentence of R869 sets out those procedures; R103 does not. In
effect, then, the first paragraph of R869 states that a Player is any
person who has sent a message to PF requesting Registration. This
brings R869 into conflict with R103, which makes Morendil a Player
despite his not having sent such a message to the PF since the time
of his last deregistration, on Oct 14. This conflict R103 wins, with
the result that Morendil, in addition to having the distinction of
being the first non-Player ever to hold Office, is also the first
non-registered person to have been a Player.

I therefore rule that the Statement is FALSE.
