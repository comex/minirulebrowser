I think you are being hopelessly naive.  Players are lazy (I know I am),
and need reminders and formal structure.

I think if Players feel strongly about an INP, they'll let the
Liaison know about it.

This report is preliminary, unofficial, and advisory only.
An official version will be posted when I have evaluated
the attempted Rule Changes more thoroughly.  

Where Rule Numbers for new Rules, and Titles of new Rules
where the titles are not specified by the creating Proposal,
are listed, they do not represent an official assignment,
but rather the numbers and titles which I expect to assign.

Proposals which do not enact any Rule Changes are not
listed here.

*=A Payment Order will be issued in accordance with Rule 947.

I agree that players are lazy, but I don't agree that formal structure 
will make that much of a difference. I am lazy about INPs, so I just
declare Presence on most of them. So do other players, I see. How is this
so different from what I propose? I make a token effort just to ensure
that some decision is made. Has the structure really made me more 
involved in the INP process?

I agree that there ought to be reminders - that is the reason why I 
made sure that the Ambassador still had to distribute the Proposal - so
people don't forget that it's going on. I should probably add a clause
saying that the Ambassador has to also explicitly inform the public of
how e is going to vote.

And just because there is no formal structure does not mean that the
Ambassador could not make use of informal structure. It just means that
e can be more flexible about how e does so.
