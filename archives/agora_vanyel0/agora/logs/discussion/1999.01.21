I had a similar idea, which you may or may not care to borrow from. 
Allow the Rulekeepor to declare one Rule either Sensible or Senseless
per week (or may remove such a designation). A Proposal to repeal
a Senseless Rule that passes doubles the reward for the proposer
and all those voting for get a small premium. A proposal to repeal
a Sensible Rule that passes gives no reward to the proposer and
all those voting against get a small premium.

No, you misunderstand my argument. When I transferred the VT, I believed that
transferring a VT was a Crime. However, I did not believe that what I did was
a Crime, because I did not believe I was transferring a VT.

[etc.]

Here is one way you might do all this using existing mechanisms:

* Commodities are a subclass of Currencies.
* The Storemaster is the Recordkeepor of all Commodities.
* Contests serve the role of Trading Proposals.
* The Bank serves the role of unclaimed Commodities.
* An entity may transfer any amount of Commodities from the Bank to emself
  by saying so in the PF.

The Promotor could Vote on eir own Proposals:  switch from Legislator to
Voter, distribute Proposals, then switch back.  Is this abuse?

Aah, so the countless un-Proposed Proposals in existence have no substantive

I would suggest merging (2) into (b), thusly:

(b) The Notary is authorized to perform any of the following with respect to
    an inanimate entity, as if e were that entity's Executor, all other
Rules
    notwithstanding:

Do recently-deregistered players have legal existence, independent of the
Probate Rules?  If not, does Rule 1043 apply to em?

Sorry Murphy, but this was sent after the end of the Voting period.

Vlad, I have some old mail messages from the time you mention.  Here
is one announcing the first win.  Unfortunately, I was using a silly
method for saving my mail at this time, so it doesn't have a
time-stamp on it.  My recollection is that it was early August 1993. 

Michael.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
To: nomic@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au
Subject: From the speaker: and the game is won


By rule 327 which allows points trading, Oerjan Johansen did give Wes
all of his 58 points in exchange for voting yes to proposal 361. Wes
duly did this, earned 58 points, taking his score to 109, and won the
game. (Note that 203 says that you must achieve 100 points (not 109)
to win, but I will not be so pedantic a Judge as to interpret that
rule as requiring an exact total. In any case, it is clear that Wes
and Oerjan can further collude to bring Wes' score to exactly 100
points; Wes need only give Oerjan 9 points for some vote). 

I will be forwarding the complete state of the game to Wes presently.
All scores are reset to zero, and "a new game is begun. All rules and
proposed rule changes retain the status they had at the end of the old
game." 

This does not say anything about the status of CFJs but I would
recommend to Wes that he ignore all of those that have been put
forward but not officially Judged.  It also doesn't say anything about
the status of votes on proposals that are currently up for vote, and
in fact I am clearly in a good position to exploit what I already know
about how people have voted.

I don't think this is particularly ethical however, so I will not vote
on any of the current proposals (360 - 372). If the Voters wish to
vote me (and presumably future ex-Speakers as well) some sort of
honorarium however, I would not object. :-) In this way, we can keep
the current votes for standing proposals. (Although Wes will have to
edit out his own votes I suspect. This is perhaps a matter for
Judgement, and I can't really enforce much now.)

There are clearly a number of areas that need fixing in the current
ruleset, and I hope that as one of the mass of Voters we will be able
to continue to improve it. The areas that I feel warrant particular
attention are:

327: point trading - in particular, restrictions to try and fix what
     Andy Latto mentioned as the 'Monopoly syndrome'. (Incidentally,
     Andy, what fixes have you devised for that problem in Monopoly?)

New players - Initaially, I was merely tardy with Stella's initial bid
    for inclusion in our game, but when Ronald revealed his conspiracy
    I resolved that as there was nothing specifying how new players
    should be admitted, I could delay indefinitely.

Power of Judgement - this needs to be specified completely and
    clearly. There is still no method of appeal, and there is still
    no real description of what effect a Judgement should have on the
    future play of the game. (Kevin's new rule determining when a rule
    is broken is a good start however).



I will also forward relevant sections of my inbox to Wes so that he
will be able to process the proposals that are waiting there. I
apologise for having taken so long over this, but things have been
quite busy here as it is. 

Finally, let me just say that I have enjoyed being Speaker of this
game, and I hope we can continue to play and enjoy nomic together. 

Your once Benevolent Speaker,
Michael.

Protoproposal Chaos72 [rev. 2]

Simplify Probate

Be it therefore resolved, that Rules 1637, 1738, 1739 and 1757 be
repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1601 be amended to read:

      (a) An entity is inanimate if it:
        (1) possesses any number of units of Currency, and
        (2) does not have an Executor.

      (b) The Notary may perform any of the following with respect to
          a inanimate entity:
        (1) transfer Currencies owned by the inanimate entity for the
            purpose of satisfying a Payment Order naming the inanimate
            entity as payor;
|       (2) Without Objection, vacate any Payment Order naming the
              inanimate entity as payor or payee; or
|       (3) Without Objection, transfer Currencies owned by that
              entity to the Bank.
| 
|     (c) The Notary is authorized, all other Rules notwithstanding,
|         to transfer Currency from any inanimate entity to any other
|         entity as if e were the inanimate entity's Executor, when e
|         is permitted to do so in accordance with subdivision (b) of
|         this Rule.
| 
|     (d) A inanimate entity is considered to continue to have legal
            existence as long as it continues to possess units of
            Currency, even if it is dissolved, destroyed, or otherwise
|         would cease to have legal existence prior to that time.  An
|         entity which has legal existence solely as a result of this
|         subdivision is called "terminal".

If this keeps up, we might have to legislate an insanity defense!

So it was.  One of these days I'll start actually reading the
Proposals people make. :)

I don't care that much about whether Euros/electronic funds are cash,
only whether they constitute a "tangible medium of exchange."

This may seem like a crazy idea (although I think it has been suggested in
the past), but the one commodity Agora seems to produce in abundance is
Rules. So why not let Players buy, sell, and trade Rules? Exactly what
players would gain from owning a Rule is open to debate. Perhaps they
might be rewarded the longer the Rule went without repeal or amendment. Or
perhaps they might be rewarded for repeals or amendments. I'm sure other
ideas will occur to you.

I would argue that deregistered Players continue to have legal
existence, since they continue to have actual existence and the Rules
do not act to create a legal fiction that deregistered Players do not
exist.  In fact, the Rules clearly contemplate that deregistered
Players continue to exist, in places such as Rule 1043, which you
cite, and also Rule 1437, amongst others.  Also, nonregistered persons
generally have had legal existence extended to them through the
judicially-recognized right of non-Players to call CFJs.

We have not (to my knowledge) had to entertain the consequences that
would accompany the death of a Player or former Player.  This actually
happened in another Nomic, and nearly crashed it (they were a
turn-based Nomic with no legal means to skip the turn of a
nonresponsive Player).

Yes, that is my anticipation; a Proposal would only have interaction
with the rest of the Game when Proposed.

I considered language that made the act of Proposing work a
transition, but that just made the Rule more complex (having to talk
of "potential Proposals" and so forth).  No need to obfuscate the
concept unnecessarily.

Nor should the notion of the law creating almost boundless instances
of legal entities bother us; the number of offers and contracts
created each day by the average person is substantial, although I
suspect few of us are aware of it.

Probably; that's the potential for abuse I had myself identified.
There are possible means to avoid it, of course; most radical is
requiring the Promotor to remain a Legislator for the duration of eir
tenure in Office.

Actually, this gives me a notion.  What if we restricted the right to
Propose to the Promotor?  Players wishing to legislate would make
agreements with the Promotor to Propose their Proposals on their
behalf.  The question would be to what extent we limit the Promotor's
freedom to control the making of such agreements, of course.

Your question actually being, just what does the provision so phrased 
in Chaos' proto actually target; and your point being that if 'tangible'
refers to hard, physical cash, we could adopt a Rule making euros
a Currency of Agora... Right ?

Not that I would see any problem with euros, or even dollars, becoming
a Currency under the Rules; that provision could be dispensed with. 
If you owed someone a dollar in Agora, that wouldn't be a problem 
unless there were also a Rule dictating settlement of such a debt in 
actual dollars; and even if there were, it would be unenforceable.

I am not clear whether it is or not.  After all, this sounds like
reaching into the mind of the Rulekeepor and changing it, something I
think you would say is impossible.  

I am in favor of doing away with the notion of Nomic Properties; I
think that concept is rather scratchy at best.  (I would also like to
do away with Rule 1011.)

I've drafted a revision of Rule 1728 that would allow for a broader
class of actions which may be performed Without Objection; it should
appear at the top of the hour.

Would it? Scott can answer this better than I, but if the debt was
between two US citizens, it might be considered a contract in some states.

Protoproposal Chaos74 [rev. 1]

Broaden Actions Without Objection

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1728 be amended to read:

      (a) When the Rules specify that an action may be performed
          "Without N Objections", where N is an integer between one
          and five inclusive, that action may be legally performed
          under the following conditions:
        (1) The Player who seeks to perform the action has announced
            eir intent to perform that action not fewer than four days
            before, nor fourteen days before, the performance of the
            action, and this announcement must unambiguously describe
            the action to be performed;
        (2) The action performed must match exactly the action
            described in the announcement made under subdivision
            (a)(1) of this Rule;
        (3) The Rule which authorizes the performance of that action
            Without N Objections must explicitly state which Player or
            Players are authorized to perform that action; and
        (4) During the time between the announcement made under
            subdivision (a)(1) of this Rule and the performance of the
            action itself, fewer than N Players have posted, in the
            Public Forum, Objections to the performance of that
            action.

      (b) If the action to be performed is the change of some property
          under that Player's control, the change may not take place
          until the Player announces that e is making that change. 
          (This requirement is met by making any announcement normally
          required by the Rules in order to make such changes.)

      (c) The specification in the Rules that an action may be
          performed "Without Objection" is equivalent to specifying
          that it may be performed "Without 1 Objection".

      (d) The specification in the Rules that an action may be
          performed "Without N Objections" in no way prohibits
          performing that same action if doing so would be otherwise
          permissible.

      (e) A Rule may specify further restrictions upon the performance
          of an action Without N Objections, and this Rule defers to
          such Rules.

It would be an enforceable contract in the United States; furthermore,
the courts would not review it because Agora has internal arbitration
procedures which are sufficiently fair to afford due process of law.

I would not object to this.

I would say that it does not.  I'm afraid this would require either it's
own definition of a "without objection" mechanism or a rewrite of
R1728.  Actually, I'm with Scott on the elimination of this "Nomic
Property" concept.  I'd favor changing R1728 to something like,
"Certain changes to the game state may be made...".

The provision is intended to prevent making poker chips, bananas, or
any other object having physical existence a Currency.  The reason for
this is threefold: one, we should not have to be physically mailing
each other things; two, none of us can readily examine another's
possessions to determine actual holdings; three, the potential for
cheating is too high.

The provision can probably be dispensed with in any case because both
for such objects and for broadly recognized currencies such as euros
or dollars, there will be a problem finding a Recordkeepor who will
consent to performing the duties mandated by the proposed Rules.  I
doubt my bank will agree to comply, for example.

However, I do believe that the Rules of Agora have sufficient legal
power to bind Players (at least those with nexus in the United States)
to convey real or personal property to other Players (or in fact to
anyone at all).  

If Agora passed a Rule requiring each of us to contribute US$25 to a
fund for the purpose of obtaining a domain name and website, I believe
that the contract law of the United States would (a) require me to
make such a contribution (b) vest in the Speaker, or other person
designated to collect such funds, the power to bring a suit in Indiana
court[1] in the event of my breach of this duty and (c) require the
court to grant that person's motion for judgment on the pleadings
and/or summary judgment on the basis that I agreed to have such
obligations imposed and adjudicated under the procedured established
by Agoran "contract".  (American law generally is that a court will
not review awards in arbitration, but will sustain them without
comment, except where a statutory right to review exists, where a lack
of review would frustrate a statutory or constitutional right, or
where the arbitration procedure is manifestly unfair or was not
followed.)

[1] Jurisdiction is proper in Indiana court because the federal courts
would lack subject matter jurisdiction; diversity jurisdiction
requires that the amount in controversy be at least $75,000.

I think this begs the question.  The "Game State" (another concept I
don't much care for) is nothing more than the collection of all Nomic
Properties.

I disagree.  The "game state" is shorthand for *all* items and information
relevant to the current status of Agora - not just the collection of things which
we have defined to be "Nomic Properties".  Specifically, the game state
includes the status of entities which *do* have existence independent
of Agora's Rules, but which have legal significance within the game.

If you can come up with a term that you like better, I'm open to suggestions.

Then you must necessarily admit that the "game state," as you define
it, is not generally legally protected from change, and that elements
it are not subject to being changed under the authority of the Rules
either because they are subject to the control of a jurisdiction other
than the Rules (e.g. the Internomic Rules, when we were a member of
Internomic) or because they are beyond control (e.g. the passage of
time).

I'm not sure that there is a meaningful distinction between "game
state" as you have defined it, and "everything".

Protoproposal Chaos56 [rev. 18]

Currencies

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1721 be amended to read:

      There shall exist the Office of Chancellor.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1467 be amended to read:

      (a) A Currency is any medium of exchange which has been
          designated as a Currency in accordance with the Rules.

      (b) The designation of a medium of exchange as a Currency, and
          the cancellation of such designation, may be accomplished
          only by:
        (1) the operation of an Instrument with Power 1 or greater;
        (2) the Chancellor, Without Objection; or
        (3) Judicial Order, whenever the Rules so permit.

      (c) For the purposes of the Rules, units of a Currency are
          fungible and indivisible.

|     (d) A Currency may be denominated such that a fraction of its
          primary denomination is its smallest indivisible unit, so
          long as there is a smallest indivisible unit.  When no other
          specification exists, the smallest indivisible unit of a
          Currency shall be one unit of its smallest denomination. 
          Amounts less than this smallest indivisible unit may be used
          in intermediate calculations; all such calculations shall be
          rounded off at the point that they are reduced to transfers,
          orders to transfer, or other finalized results of legal
          import.

|     (e) The Chancellor shall retain and publish at least monthly a
          schedule, listing every medium of exchange designated as a
          Currency under this Rule.  This schedule shall include
          whatever information the Chancellor deems necessary, but at
          least the following information for each Currency:
        (1) the designated denomination or denominations of that
            Currency (and if more than one, the relationship between
            them);
        (2) the fraction of the smallest denomination of that Currency
            which is its smallest indivisible unit;
        (3) that Currency's Recordkeepor; and,
        (4) the Mintor or Mintors of that Currency, if any.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) The "Recordkeeper" of a Currency refers to the entity who
          has agreed to maintain a record of the ownership of the
          units of that Currency.  The Recordkeepor of an Currency is
          subject to the jurisdiction of these Rules.  Specifically, e
          shall:
        (1) maintain the abovementioned records in a manner consistent
            with these Rules, including the timely recordation of
            transfers of ownership made consistent with the Rules;
        (2) comply in a timely manner to all requests to produce those
            records as required by the Rules; and
        (3) perform all other duties which the Rules impose upon the
            Recordkeepor of a Currency.

      (b) A Currency may have any number of designated Mintors.  A
          Mintor may be designated for a Currency, or such designated
          cancelled, by:
        (1) the operation of an Instrument with Power 1 or greater; or
        (2) the Chancellor, Without Objection.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1598 be amended to read:

      Units of a Currency are transferred only when the Recordkeepor
      of that Currency receives a notice from the owner of one or more
      units of that Currency, specifying the units to be transferred
      and the entity who is to owner the units thus transferred.  The
      entity receiving the units thus transferred becomes their owner,
      and the Recordkeepor shall so note this on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1471 be amended to read:

      Units of a Currency are created only when the Recordkeepor of
      that Currency receives a notice from a designated Mintor of that
      Currency, specifying the number of units to be created and the
      entity who is to own the units so created.  The specified entity
      owns the units so created, and the Recordkeepor shall so note
      this on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      Units of a Currency are destroyed only when the Recordkeepor of
      that Currency receives a notice from the owner of one or more
      units of that Currency, specifying the units to be destroyed. 
      The Recordkeepor shall note this destruction on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1596 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever an entity becomes indebted to another for some
          amount of Currency, that entity indebted is required to
          transfer that amount of Currency to the entity indebted to
          within seven days.

      (b) A debt not paid within seven days is overdue.  Any entity to
          whom an overdue debt is due may assess a late penalty of not
          more than 25% of the overdue debt, and may do so repeatedly,
          not more than once every seven days after the debt becomes
          overdue.  Late penalties are added to the overdue debt.  An
          entity may elect to charge smaller late penalties, charge
          them less frequently, or forego late penalties altogether,
          at that entity's sole discretion.

      (c) If the validity of a debt, or any part thereof, is disputed
          by a Call for Judgement, that debt (or portion thereof) is
          not considered overdue, and does not accrue late penalties,
          while the dispute remains unsettled.

      (d) When an entity transfers units of Currency to another entity
          for the purpose of making a payment on debt, the receiving
          entity shall apply that payment to the nondisputed debts
          owed to em by the transferring entity, in order from oldest
          to newest.  A debt is paid when a transfer has been applied
|         to it in this manner.  Any surplus may be returned to the
|         transferring entity, or may be retained by the receiving
|         entity to be applied to future debts.  Any amount retained
|         by a receiving entity in this manner shall be returned upon
|         demand.

      (e) An entity may assume that any Currencies transferred to it
          to be payments on debts due to em, unless the transferree
          clearly indicates otherwise when making the transfer.

      (f) An entity who is owed an overdue debt may issue an Order
          requiring the entity who owes that debt to make payment by
          requiring a transfer of any amount up to the amount of the
          debt due, but only if no other Order currently in force
          requires the same entity to make payment on that same debt
          or any part thereof.  Such an Order shall be stayed (by the
          Clerk of the Courts) if the debt in question is subsequently
          disputed, and vacated (by the Judge) if it is found that the
          debt upon which the Order is based is invalid.

      (g) An entity who is owed a debt may cancel all or part of that
          debt at any time.

      (h) A Judge may enjoin the assessment of late penalties,
          restrict the amount of late penalties, or require the
          reduction or cancellation of a debt, by Judicial Order, when
          the Rules specifically so allow.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1479 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever a Rule calls for an Officer to pay out some
          quantity of Currency to some entity, that Officer shall
          execute a Notice of Debt for the given amount with that
          entity as payee and the Bank as payor.

      (b) Whenever a Rule calls for an Officer to bill an entity for
          some quantity of Currency, that Officer shall execute a
          Notice of Debt for the given amount with that entity as
          payor and the Bank as payee.

      (c) A Notice of Debt is executed by announcing in the Public
          Forum that the payor is indebted to the payee for the amount
          indicated, so long as the announcement sets for the reason
          therefore.

      (d) The lawful execution of a Notice of Debt causes the payor
          noted therein to be indebted to the payee noted therein for
          the amount noted therein, but only if the executor of the
          Notice of Debt was authorized to execute it, and the reason
          set forth therein is correct.

      (e) The duties required of Officers by this Rule shall be
          performed as soon as possible after they arise.

      (f) For the purposes of this Rule, the Speaker shall be
          considered an Officer.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1817 be amended to read:

      (a) The Recordkeepor of a Currency is required to record every
          transfer for which e receives a transfer notice denominated
          in the Currency of which e is the recordkeepor, when:
        (1) the notice was sent by the transferring entity's Executor,
            or, for an entity which lacks an Executor, by any other
            person empowered by the Rules to execute transfers on the
            behalf of the transferring entity;
        (2) the notice clearly sets forth the quantity to be
            transferred in a form such that the Recordkeepor can
            easily and definitively determine the amount being
            transferred;
        (3) the entity to receive the transfer is specified with
            sufficient clarity that a reasonable person in the
            Recordkeepor's position would know to which entity the
            transferring entity refers; and
        (4) the transfer is for an amount not more than the current
            holdings of the transferring entity.

      (b) Transfers shall be noted on the Recordkeepor's records in
          the order in which they are received by the Recordkeepor.

      (c) When a Recordkeepor records a transfer, e shall promptly
          inform the recipient of the transfer that the transfer has
          been recorded, unless it appears to the Recordkeepor that
          the recipient is already aware of the transfer.

      (d) When a Recordkeepor elects not to record a transfer for the
          reason that the transfer is not in conformance with any part
          of subdivision (a) of this Rule, e shall promptly inform
          both the transferrer and the recipient that the transfer has
          not be recorded, and give the reason therefor.  (If the
          reason for failure to record is that the recipient was not
          clearly specified, there is no duty to inform the
          recipient.)

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1696 be amended to read:

      (a) Voting Tokens are hereby designated as a Currency.  The sole
          designated Mintor of Voting Tokens is the Bank.  The
          Recordkeepor of Voting Tokens is irrevocably designated to
          be the Accountor.  The smallest indivisible unit for this
          Currency is 0.01 Voting Token.

      (b) The Accountor constructively agrees to act as Recordkeepor
          for Voting Tokens by accepting the Office.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1701 be amended to read:

      (a) Proposal Notes are hereby designated as a Currency.  The
          sole designated Mintor of Proposal Notes is the Bank.  The
          Recordkeepor of Proposal Notes is irrevocably designated to
          be the Promotor.

      (b) The Promotor constructively agrees to act as Recordkeepor
          for Proposal Notes by accepting the Office.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1435 be amended to read:

      (a) Indulgences are hereby designated as a Currency.  The sole
          designated Mintor of Indulgences is the Bank.  The
          Recordkeepor of Indulgences is irrevocably designated to be
          the Herald.

      (b) The Herald constructively agrees to act as Recordkeepor for
          Indulgences by accepting the Office.

      (c) An entity which owes a debt (or debts) to the Bank for any
          number of Indulgences is said to have that number of Blots.
          A Player has Blots equal to the sum of all such debts. Debts
          which are in dispute are still considered when determining
          how many Blots a Player has.

      (d) When a Rule states that a Player is to gain some number of
          Blots, a Notice of Debt shall be executed for the same
          number of Indulgences, naming that Player as the payor and
          the Bank as payee; this order shall be executed by whomever
          the Rules require to report the change in Blots.

      (e) A Player who has no debt in Indulgences to the Bank is
          Immaculate.

      (f) It is a Win-Preventing condition for a Player to have one or
          more Blots.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1601 be amended to read:

      (a) An entity is dissolute if it:
        (1) possesses any number of units of Currency, and
        (2) does not have an Executor.

      (b) The Notary may perform any of the following with respect to
          a dissolute entity:
        (1) transfer Currencies owned by that entity to any entity to
            which the dissolute entity owes debts, for the purpose of
            making partial or complete payment on those debts;
        (2) cancel in part or in full any debts owed to it; or
        (3) Without Objection, transfer Currencies owned by that
            entity to the Bank.

      (c) The Notary is authorized, all other Rules notwithstanding,
          to transfer Currency from any dissolute entity to any other
          entity as if e were the dissolute entity's Executor, when e
          is permitted to do so in accordance with subdivision (b) of
          this Rule.

      (d) A dissolute entity is considered to continue to have legal
          existence as long as it continues to possess units of
          Currency, even if it is dissolved, destroyed, or otherwise
          would cease to have legal existence prior to that time.  An
          entity which has legal existence solely as a result of this
          subdivision is called "terminal".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1853 be amended to read:

      (a) Taxes may be levied only when the Rules explicitly permit
          it, and then only by the Officer authorized by the Rule
          permitting the levy.

      (b) An Officer levies a tax by announcing it in a Public Forum.
          An announcement of levy must specify:
        (1) The Currency being taxed;
        (2) the amount of the levy, expressed as a percentage; and
        (3) the legal authorization for the levy.

      (c) Upon the announcement of a tax levy conforming with
          subdivision (b) of this Rule, each entity other than the
          Bank becomes liable to the Bank for a debt equal to the
          stated percentage of that entity's holdings of the Currency
          stated in the announcement.  The amount of each entity's tax
          debt shall be based on the amount of that Currency owned by
          that entity at the time the announcement was made.

      (d) The Recordkeepor of the Currency named in a tax levy shall,
          as soon as possible after the announcement, provide a report
          setting out the amount of the taxed Currency held by every
          entity which held any units of that Currency at the time the
          announcement was made.  The Recordkeepor is not required to
          compute the tax due; if e does so, eir computations do not
          have any legal force.

      (e) The amount of tax levied may not exceed 50% of an entity's
          holdings unless the Rule which authorizes the tax explicitly
          permits it.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) The Voting Bank shall exist.

      (b) The Assessor is the Executor of the Voting Bank.

      (c) The Assessor shall not (as its Executor) transfer Currencies
          out of the Voting Bank except when required to do so by the
          Rules.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1442 be amended to read:

      (a) Proposals have a voting cost, equal to the Voting Tariff at
          the time they were distributed. If there was no value set
          for the Voting Tariff at that time, then the voting cost is
          1 VT.

      (b) Each Voting Entity who votes on a Proposal is liable to a
          debt to the Voting Bank for a number of Voting Tokens equal
          to the votes cast by that entity on that proposal,
          multiplied by the voting cost of that Proposal.  This debt
          is realized when the results of the Voting on that Proposal
          are announced.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1824 be amended to read:

      (a) Any entity who, at the beginning of a given Nomic Week, is
          overdue on a debt due to the Voting Bank, commits the
          Infraction of Debt Voting.

          to do so.

      (d) If the Chancellor makes a transfer not permitted by
          subdivision (c) of this Rule, e commits the Class A Crime of
          Misappropriation, and upon conviction of this Crime shall be
          removed from Office.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 766 be amended, by deleting the
paragraph which reads "Each Group has Mint Authority."

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1466 be amended, by replacing the
term "Payment Order" with the term "Notice of Debt" wherever it may
appear.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1742 be amended, by deleting the
sentence which reads "When restitution would involve the transfer of
Currencies, the Judge is authorized to execute whatever Payment Orders
are necessary to effect fair and appropriate restitution." and also by
replacing the phrase "nor shall restitution include the execution of
Payment Orders, the payor of which is any entity not party to the
agreement" with "nor shall restitution include the requirement for any
entity not party to the agreement to make any transfer of Currency".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 502 be amended to read:

      (a) The Clerk of the Courts shall, within one week of the time a

      Agora's Birthday, the Chancellor shall, on behalf of the Bank,
      submit delayed Transfer Orders to be executed at 00:04:30 GMT
      +1200 on Agora's Birthday to each Player for the amount of 3 VTs
      each;

I have just begun work on a major revision to the Categorized
Rule Lists on the web.  This will be not just a matter of revising
the headings available, but also making major changes to the
way they are organized.  It will be significant enough that I
will probably no longer call them the "Categorized Rule Lists"
once it is complete.  (Something along the lines of "Rule Index"
might be more accurate.)

I expect this to involve quite a lot of work, so it will probably
be on the order of months before anyone will see it.  The reason
I mention it, though, is to ask for suggestions.  What do you like
about the current CRLs?  What don't you like about them?  What
features would you like to see?  Now is the time to make suggestions,
while this is still in the early stages.  I can't make any promises
about what will be included, but I will at least consider all suggestions.

Given that you typed the words "I hereby transfer 1 VT to Steve", that
assertion is very difficult to accept. What *did* you believe you were
doing by typing those words in a message to the PF, if not transferring
a VT?

But even if we accept your statement that you did not believe that you
were transferring a VT, the question is: was this a reasonable belief
for you to have in the circumstances? And, again, I think the answer to
that question has to be "no". The reasonable belief to have in those
circumstances would have been that those words, in a message to the PF,
would have the effect of transferring a VT.

I was the Speaker for some of this period, and I have the texts for
Proposals 984-1062, and reports of results for Proposals 965-1062,
which I'll happily make available to you if you're interested,

I think they eventually decided to rule that the deceased Player had
taken his turn by doing nothing, through extra-legal agreement.  They
then amended the Rules to state the maximum time a Player may use to
take his turn, after which he is considered to have passed his turn.

I could send you my CFJ folder, which I think is complete all the way
back to CFJ 816. If you use elm, you'll be able to read it just as I
can. It's about 2.5Mb. I could gzip and uuencode it first if you like.

I could read this file, by saving the rtf file, ftping it to my machine
at home, punting it over to the DOS partition, and using Word to read it
there. But it would be a lot easier if you could post a plain text
version, which I could read here. Possible?

That's true. Of course, if you're not a Legislator, then the only way to
get a Proposal distributed will be to get a Legislator to agree to
submit it, which does give some agenda-setting power to the Legislator.
On the other hand, it may well be a good idea to limit the number of
Proposals which can be placed in the Proposal Queue, to, say, 10, or
limit the number of Proposals any one Legislator can have in the Queue
at one time, or both, which might make Legislators think carefully about
what Proposals they were prepared to submit.

In force, I think.  Blob issued it; he tried to vacate it but the
Office had devolved to me in the interim, I think, making his effort
to vacate it ineffective.  I took no further action, so it should
still be in force.

Nonetheless, I'll check into it.

Of course not.  There's always "Agora Nomic hereby adopts, by
reference Chapter 1 of Part A of Title 18 of the United States Code,
to the extent that this body of law can be applied to Agora Nomic."

Surely limiting the frequency of changes makes this effectively impossible.
If we can only change status every two months, as Steve proposes, then 
you could pull this trick off at most once every four months. And it's 
really not anything unique to the Promotor - just about anyone could do
it.

No way will I agree to limit Proposing powers to just _one_ player. The
Promotor already has a lot of power over which Proposals get distributed
when, by manipulating the Queue. It is even within eir power to sometimes 
see that proposals don't get distributed at all. It was a power I made 
good use of while Promotor, although I'm not about to explain the details. :)

I never tried to vacate it, I was going to check the rules first. 
In fact, I never formally responded to the COE - all my posts went to
the discussion list, not the PF.

Maybe... but I'd recommend we start with the simplest change first, and
then add provisions like this when/if we find them necessary.

That remains my intention. Any comments on the first draft of 'A
Separation of Powers'?

Can you say more about the problems you perceive with the concept of
Nomic Properties? I think it's stood up remarkably well, and I remain
fond of R1011. For example, while I was writing 'A Separation of
Powers', it was comforting to know that being either a Legislator or a
Voter is a Nomic Property, and hence that one's status as one or the
other cannot be changed other than via procedures specified in the
Rules. I think it's a good safety net.
