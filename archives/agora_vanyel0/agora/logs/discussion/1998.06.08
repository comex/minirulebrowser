Am I correct in believing that no judge has yet been appointed for the
CFJ I made on the 30th or have I missed something?

H. Clerk of the Court, I hereby submit the following CFJ;
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Statement:
      "Player Macross has issued an Order the text of which is:

       I hereby Order and command Player Swann to refrain
       from using words that are not spelled the same
       backwards as forwards when issuing any Administrative,
       Judicial, Appellate or Private Orders unless the
       issuing of those Orders is explicitly required of
       'em by the Rules or by an Order issued by Player
       Macross."

I believe that this order is invalid.  Rule 1793/0 reads in part:

      An Order is a command, executed by a Player and directed to some
      entity requiring that entity to perform exactly one action, or
      to refrain from performing one or more actions.

You have here amended an order to require me to take an action and
to refrain from taking actions.  However an order may only do one or
the other, not both.  Thus I believe this order is by definition not
an Order at all.


I issue the order below, only if it is legal for me to do:

I hereby Order and command Player Swann to refrain from using words
       that are not spelled the same backwards as forwards when
       issuing any Administrative, Judicial, Appellate or Private
       Orders unless the issuing of those Orders is explicitly
       required of 'em by the Rules or by an Order issued by Player
       Macross.


This should effectively hold off the dictator.

-Macross

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This and the recent ruling on CFJ 1049 lead to the conclusion that the
Order was indeed issued.

-Macross

You haven't missed anything.  I'll be sending out your CFJ fairly
soon.  I've been away in Glasgow recently, and I'm extremely busy with
real life to boot, but it will get done.

After my last proposal failed quorum, I've decided that I have very
little to gain by voting or declaring presence on other people's
proposals without being offered something in return.

Of course, this decision by Swann is perfectly fair, and a nice
outcome of the current situation where the economy is beginning to
work. But I'd like to remind those of you who are getting desperate
about proposals that fail (or are about to fail) quorum that the
quorum tools are still there, including quorum buyback. Of course that
costs additional P-notes which noone has ;), but still there are many
ways to make proposals pass, or at least reach (or not reach) quorum,
both formal ones (quorum tools) and informal (like Swann's policy, or
the strategy of not voting at all on proposals you don't like - we may
also begin to see some proposals reach quorum and pass only due to
votes that were cast against the proposal...)

Excellent.... and take as much time as you need.  I apologize if it seemed
that I was trying to rush you on this.  It's just that I had seen several
official posts from you with no mention of it and I wanted to be sure you
hadn't missed it.

You are correct. Evidently CotC Michael is having a busy patch.
Nevertheless, this is another technical violation of R1023 by Michael.

After 10 days wait, I don't think anyone could accuse you of trying
to rush Michael.
