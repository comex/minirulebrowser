Protoproposal Chaos18 [rev. 3]

Probate, Take Two

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1601 be amended to read:

      The Notary shall place in Probate any entity which possesses
      Units of Currency or which is named as the Payee or Payor of any
      Payment Order, which does not have an Executor, and which is not
      already in Probate, as soon as possible after being made aware
      of this condition.

      No entity may be destroyed while it possesses Units of Currency
      or while it is named as the Payee or Payor of any Payment
      Orders; any attempt to destroy an entity while it is in this
      condition shall be deferred until this condition no longer
      holds.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would destroy an
      entity while it possesses units of Currency.

      The following definitions apply with respect to entities in
      Probate:

      1. Assets: all units of Currency held by the entity in Probate,
         along with all Payment Orders naming the entity in Probate as
         payee.

      2. Debt: a Payment Orders naming the entity in Probate as payor.
 
      3. Credit: a Payment Order naming the entity in Probate as
         payee.

      4. Creditor: an entity which is the payee of a debt.

      5. Debtor: an entity which is the payor of a credit.

      6. Heir: an entity named in the Will (if any) of the entity in
         Probate.

      7. Estate: the assets and debts of the entity in Probate.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1745 be repealed.

[An entity possessing stranded Currencies is placed in Probate
 instead.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1738 be amended to read:

      Whenever there is an entity in Probate which does not have an
      Trustee, the Notary shall nominate a Player to be that entity's
      Trustee.  E shall announce this appointment in the Public Forum.

      As soon as possible after the Notary announces the appointment
      of a Trustee for an entity in Probate, each Recordkeepor, with
      respect to the Currency of which e is the Recordkeepor, shall
      provide to that Trustee an accounting of the number of units of
      that Currency held by the entity in Probate, and a list of all
      Payment Orders naming the entity in Probate as either Payor or
      Payee.

      As soon as possible after the Trustee has received all of the
      reports required by the previous paragraph, e shall formulate
      and announce in the Public Forum a Plan for the disposition of
      the estate of the entity in Probate according to the provisions
      of the Probate Code.  However, if the Trustee determines, during
      the course of constructing the Plan, that any of the credits or
      debts of the entity in Probate is disputed, e shall announce
      this fact in the Public Forum, and shall neither formulate nor
      announce a Plan until after the dispute has been settled, and
      shall do so as soon as possible after the dispute has been
      settled.

      If no legally-made objection to the Plan is posted in the Public
      Forum during a waiting period of seven days following its
      announcement, the Trustee shall, as soon as possible after the
      expiration of thia waiting period, perform whatever steps are
      necessary to implement the Plan for disposition.  If there is a
      legally-made objection, the Trustee shall, as soon as possible
      after the objection is announced, formulate and announce a new
      Plan as above, repeating the process until there is no
      objection.

      However, if a CFJ is made alleging that an objection to a
      Trustee's Plan lacks foundation, then the Trustee shall neither
      formulate a new Plan nor implement the existing Plan until the
      CFJ is resolved.  If a CFJ finds that an objection lacks
      foundation, then the Trustee may proceed as if that objection
      had never been made, and any attempt to announce that same
      objection again is not legally made.

      An objection to a Plan for disposition has foundation if it
      properly alleges that:
        a) the Plan constructed is not in accord with the provisions
           of the Probate Code;
        b) the Plan disregards the Will (if any) of the entity in
           Probate;
        c) the implementation of the Plan as constructed would be
           substantially unfair to a creditor or heir of the entity in
           Probate; or
        d) the Plan would not fully dispose of the estate of the
           entity in Probate.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      The Trustee of an entity in Probate is empowered to submit on
      behalf of that entity whatever Transfer Orders are necessary to
      implement eir Plan for the disposition of that entity's Estate,
      as if e were that entity's Executor.  The Trustee may also
      execute and vacate Payment Orders when necessary to implement
      the Plan for the disposition of the Estate.

      The Trustee may exercise the above powers only when implementing
      a Plan for the disposition of the Estate of the entity in
      Probate of which e is the Trustee.

      The Trustee of an entity in Probate ceases to be Trustee when:
        a) e announces in the Public Forum that e resigns as Trustee;
        b) e ceases to be a Player;
        c) the entity of which e is Trustee ceases to be in Probate;
           or 
        d) the Notary announces that e has been removed as Trustee.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1739 be amended to read:

      The Plan for the disposition of the estate of an entity in
      Probate shall be constructed by its Trustee as detailed below.

      First, the Plan shall divide the assets of the estate amongst
      its creditors, assigning to each creditor assets equal to the
      amount due that creditor if possible, or a pro-rata portion if
      not.  All debts, whether satisfied in full or not, shall be
      cancelled.

      Next, if the entity in Probate is terminal, the Plan shall apply
      the Will, if any, of the entity in Probate to the extent
      possible.  Any assets remaining after the application of the
      Will shall be divided amongst the heirs named in the Will,
      assigning to each heir a portion computed in a manner consistent
      with the Will; if the Will is silent or unclear on the division
      of remaining assets, the division shall be equal.

      Next, if the entity in Probate is terminal, and there is no Will
      or the Will fails to fully dispose of all assets of the entity
      in Probate, the Plan shall then cancel all remaining credits and
      assign all remaining units of Currency to the Bank.

      Units of Currency are assigned to an entity by requiring a
      Transfer Order for those Units of Currency from the entity in
      Probate to that Entity.  

      A credit is assigned to an entity by requiring a Payment Order
      from the payor of the credit to the entity to whom it has been
      assigned; however, if the payor of the credit is the same as the
      entity to whom it is to be assigned, no Payment Order shall be
      required.

      A debt is cancelled by requiring the vacation of the Payment
      Order which established it.

Protoproposal Chaos12 [rev. 2]

Simplify Judicial Salaries

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 502 be amended to read:

      The Clerk of the Courts shall, within one week of the time a
      Player earns a Judicial Salary, pay out that Judicial Salary to
      that Player.

      If a decision (or dismissal) which resulted in a Player earning
      a Judicial Salary is subsequently appealed and overturned on
      appeal, the Clerk of the Court shall vacate the Payment Order
      paying the salary originally received for that decision.

[Simplifies matters considerably.  The "within one week" is used
 instead of ASAP to allow the CotC to batch salary payments together
 instead of having to do them in strict ASAP order.]

So I consider this statement in the Ambassador's Report to be informational

It's a refugee from the old Extra Vote days, one that somehow got into

3615:
I agree with some others that the Objects proposal
needs some work.  The
fact that it clears away the entire Pragmatic
Currencies apparatus is not
what troubles me; the fact that a single Officer
can deregister every other
player for Lawlessness does.

{True, e might commit a Crime by doing so; but who
would judge the CFJ
against em?  We do not have a legal principle that
consequences of a crime
are nullified, so the deregistrations would stand.
 And by the time anyone
was able to re-register, the Rules might look very
different.}

3616:
Nonchallenge of Election results is a move towards
crisis avoidance, and
extension of this principle into other areas would
also be welcome.

3620 and 3621:
I have not yet made up my mind between these two. 
I will attempt to do so
before the voting deadline, if it matters.

Re: DIS: Re: Infected Voting

Something about Scott's and Steve's interpretation of R1442 struck me as
requiring a closer look.  They are saying that R1442 specifies that votes cast
without VTs to back them up are not to be counted and thus are illegal by
implication.  This avoids conflict with R955 by making the votes illegal and so
they do not have to be counted.  But R955 says that only legal votes are
countable and this interpretation says only countable votes are legal, so how
can any vote ever be counted?  A vote is never legal until it becomes
countable, but R955 says a vote is not countable unless it is legal, which
leads to the clasic "deadly embrace" where each condition is waiting on the
other to become true.

That's not quite how I'd characterize my position. Specifically, I
would not simply assert that it's being countable that makes a vote
legal.  Rather, I'd say that it's being backed up by VT expenditure
that makes a vote countable and therefore legal. So the deadly
embrace is broken: if there is expenditure, the vote is countable
and therefore legal; if there is no expenditure, the vote is not
countable and is therefore not legal.

Not quite. I do like the construction you've come up with here
('performed one of these actions'), which is neater than mine.
But you need to add something like: '...and has not subsequently
superceded it with another action'.

"Morendil has Voted FOR Proposal 4000" is not the same as "Morendil has
Voted FOR Proposal 4000 and has not changed that Vote".  Do you still
think the extra clause is needed?
