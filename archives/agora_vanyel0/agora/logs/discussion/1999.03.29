You're quoting Vlad's statement out of its context, which makes it clear
what it is that the actual Proposal is supposed to be an exemplar of.

That's a fallacy of equivocation. My original contention was that
political pressure could undermine the protection allegedly provided by
the power to Object to Summary Adoption, or, as you would put it, the
right to be an obstinate jerk. Against this, you offerred the
counter-argument that Summary Adoption adds a new item to the economy,
the power to sell one's right to Object. This argument assumes that the
jerk has ceased to be obstinate and has instead, on your advice, decided
that e is prepared to be bought. In my post above, I was accepting that
premise - for the sake of argument, you understand - and exploring what
the consequences of this might actually be. My conclusion was that
viewed as an economic asset, the right to Object is, or would very
quickly become, worthless because there is a massive oversupply of it -
every single Player has it. Watching you pay me not to Object, a
rational Player would wonder why you were paying me and not them when
their right to Object is just as good as mine. In that situation, a
rational Player, a non-obstinate non-jerk, would Object. Before long,
you'd find that it'd be cheaper and less time consuming just propose the
damn Proposal, rather than having to negotiate with a dozen or more
rational, self-interested potential Objectors. So, I contend, your
economic defence of Summary Adoption is a failure.

I hope that the inadequacy of your reply is now clear. My argument is
purely economic. To meet it, I'm afraid you'll need purely economic
counter-arguments - not rhetoric, and not insults. Are you up to it? We
all know you have the brains. The only question is whether you have
sufficient generosity of spirit to trade arguments rather than slurs.

Steve

It's true that something like a year passed between Oerjan's first proto
of Spring Cleaning and its eventual adoption. But it's completely
misleading to suggest that the reason for the delay was the development
time of the Proposal. My understanding - and Oerjan will correct me if
I'm mistaken - is that for nearly all of that time the Proposal simply
sat in a cupboard somewhere gathering dust, until Oerjan hauled it out,
gave it a quick dust and a spit-and-polish to bring it up to date, and
proposed it. I would estimate it's actual development time at something
closer to a week than a year. Care to comment, Oerjan?

In any event, my point is this: given that you (and perhaps some other
Players as well) already have a whole bunch of worthy but minor
amendments, none of which individually are sufficiently exciting to
muster Quorum, the strategy I recommend is putting them all together
into a single Proposal. And given that you already have the amendments,
the time it would take to do this (a few minutes of cut and paste)
cannot be a serious objection to the strategy.

Well, on that I guess we just disagree: I think they are worth haggling
over, and I find the political dynamics of these situations interesting
and worthy of exploration.

What I'm surprised to see that no one has yet brought up is that
Vlad cannot simply announce that a Proposal is adopted WO, as he has
tried to do here.  I see no announcment of Vlad's *intent* to
adopt that Proposal WO.

Should I have written "I intend to adopt this Proposal WO"? That seems
cointerintuitive, since we are talking about Acting Without Objection.
It is my actions, rather than my intent, that coint, I thought.

You must express your intent to act before acting in order to utilize
the procedure for Actions Without Objections.

          may be modified by other Rules for specific situations.
        (1) Vote Collector: The Vote Collector is the Entity
            responsible for taking nominations, collecting and
            tallying the Votes, and announcing the result.
          (A) Unless otherwise specified, this Entity is the Player
              who is Speaker at the time the Referendum starts.
          (B) If another Player is specified, this Player shall be the
              Vote Collector for the entire duration of the
              Referendum.
          (C) If the Vote Collector deregisters or is deregistered
              before the Voting Period ends, the Election has no
              Winner.
|       (3) Nominating Entities: Every Player not on Hold may Nominate
            eirself in an Election. On Hold status is measured at the
            time a Player makes a Nomination.
|       (5) Nominations: A Nominating Entity makes a Nomination by
            sending a message to the Vote Collector during the
            Nominating Period, indicating what Election e is
            Nominating for.
|       (7) Candidates: A Player who has Nominated for an Election is
            called a Candidate for that Election.
|       (9) Retraction: A Nomination, once sent to the Vote Collector,
            may be retracted before the end of the Nominating Period.
            A player may retract a Nomination e has made by sending a
            message to the Vote Collector, indicating that e wishes to
            retract eir Nomination.
|      (11) Start of Nominations: The Nominating Period begins at the
            time of the first correct and legal announcement that the
            Election has begun, as required by the Rules calling for
            the Election.
|      (13) Duration of Nominations: The Nominating Period lasts for
            one Week.  All Nominations received by the Vote Collector
            outside of the Nominating Period have no effect.
|      (15) Secrecy: Nominations need not be kept secret.

      (b) Announcing Candidates: the Vote Collector shall announce to
          the Public Forum, as soon as possible after the Nominating
          Period is over, the names of all Players who Nominated for
          the Election.

      (c) If there are no Candidates in a given Election, then that
          Election shall have no Winner. If there is only one
          Candidate in a given Election, then that Candidate shall be
          the Winner of that Election.

      (d) In all other cases, a Referendum shall being at the time
          Candidates are Announced, which shall be conducted using the
          standard procedure for Referendum Voting with the following
          exceptions:
        (1) Vote Collector: The Vote Collector for the Referendum is
            the same as the Vote Collector for the Election.
|       (3) Vote Values: A Vote is the name of exactly one of the
            Candidates for the given Election. Words which are
            effectively synonymous with these are also permissible.
|       (5) Adoption: The Winner of the Election is the Candidate for
            whom the most votes were cast. If there is more than one
            such candidate, the Speaker chooses one of those
            candidates as the winner, and must announce eir chosen
            candidate as winner to the Public Forum.
|       (7) Quorum: Quorum shall be set at 50% of the eligible Voting
            Entities at the beginning of the Voting Period. If a
            smaller fraction voted, the Election has no Winner.

|     (f) Nonperformance by Vote Collector: The Vote Collector must
          perform eir required duties, but if the result of an
          Election is not announced within one Week following the end
          of the Voting Period, the Election has no Winner.

|     (h) Effective Time of Election Results: The results of an
          Election are effective at the time the results of the
          Referendum are announced; or, if there is no Referendum, at
          the time that the Vote Collector announces that there is to
          be no Referendum.

|     (j) Cutoff for Challenges: Any challenge of the correctness of
          the announced results of an Election must be made within
          seven days of the time the results are announced.  If seven
          days pass from the time the results are announced without a
          challenge, the announced results are the true results of
          that Election, whether or not they be in error in any way.

Well, correct me if I'm wrong (as I'm sure you will), but
didn't the General phrase his SAWO about the same as I did?
I thought the action was sort of suspended until four days had passed.

              who is Speaker at the time the Referendum starts.
          (B) If another Player is specified, this Player shall be the
              Vote Collector for the entire duration of the
              Referendum.
          (C) If the Vote Collector deregisters or is deregistered
              before the Voting Period ends, the Election has no
              Winner.
|       (2) Nominating Entities: Every Player not on Hold may Nominate

            sending a message to the Vote Collector during the
            Nominating Period, indicating what Election e is
            Nominating for.
|       (4) Candidates: A Player who has Nominated for an Election is
            called a Candidate for that Election.
|       (5) Retraction: A Nomination, once sent to the Vote Collector,
            may be retracted before the end of the Nominating Period.
            A player may retract a Nomination e has made by sending a
            message to the Vote Collector, indicating that e wishes to
            retract eir Nomination.
|       (6) Start of Nominations: The Nominating Period begins at the
            time of the first correct and legal announcement that the
            Election has begun, as required by the Rules calling for
            the Election.
|       (7) Duration of Nominations: The Nominating Period lasts for
            one Week.  All Nominations received by the Vote Collector
            outside of the Nominating Period have no effect.
|       (8) Secrecy: Nominations need not be kept secret.

      (b) Announcing Candidates: the Vote Collector shall announce to
          the Public Forum, as soon as possible after the Nominating
          Period is over, the names of all Players who Nominated for
          the Election.

      (c) If there are no Candidates in a given Election, then that
          Election shall have no Winner. If there is only one
          Candidate in a given Election, then that Candidate shall be
          the Winner of that Election.

      (d) In all other cases, a Referendum shall being at the time
          Candidates are Announced, which shall be conducted using the
          standard procedure for Referendum Voting with the following
          exceptions:
        (1) Vote Collector: The Vote Collector for the Referendum is
            the same as the Vote Collector for the Election.
|       (2) Vote Values: A Vote is the name of exactly one of the
            Candidates for the given Election. Words which are
            effectively synonymous with these are also permissible.
|       (3) Adoption: The Winner of the Election is the Candidate for
            whom the most votes were cast. If there is more than one
            such candidate, the Speaker chooses one of those
            candidates as the winner, and must announce eir chosen
            candidate as winner to the Public Forum.
|       (4) Quorum: Quorum shall be set at 50% of the eligible Voting
            Entities at the beginning of the Voting Period. If a
            smaller fraction voted, the Election has no Winner.

|     (e) Nonperformance by Vote Collector: The Vote Collector must
          perform eir required duties, but if the result of an
          Election is not announced within one Week following the end
          of the Voting Period, the Election has no Winner.

|     (f) Effective Time of Election Results: The results of an
          Election are effective at the time the results of the
          Referendum are announced; or, if there is no Referendum, at
          the time that the Vote Collector announces that there is to
          be no Referendum.

|     (g) Cutoff for Challenges: Any challenge of the correctness of
          the announced results of an Election must be made within
          seven days of the time the results are announced.  If seven
          days pass from the time the results are announced without a
          challenge, the announced results are the true results of
          that Election, whether or not they be in error in any way.

I'm not sure exactly how G.Chaos phrased his, but I don't realy have any
problem with your statement as implying intent and so considering it
to be valid.  The problem you might run into, however, is that you
would still be required to confirm your action after the objection
period had passed.  We would not allow it to automatically
take effect at that point.

Perhaps you should re-read R1728.

No; my message read "I hereby announce my intent to cause the
following Proposal to be Adopted Without Objection".  Your message
read "I hereby cause the Proposal entitled 'Vlad in the Rules' to be
Adopted Without Objection" (internal quotation marks changed).  What
you did is what you should properly have done after you had previously
announced your intent and allowed the statutorily-required time to
pass without an objection being voiced.

By the way, on this whole Summary Adoption issue, while I support the
Summary Adoption system, and think that Steve is being unnecessarily 
stubborn in his resistance to it, I do not hold with Gen Chaos' practice
of making personal attacks on him.

Okay, so there ought to be some room for a bit of rhetoric and role-playing,
and some degree of name-calling may be part of it, but only in fun, and
it should definitely stop when people are being offended or hurt. I think
General Chaos has gone beyond that, and is just being rude. And that can
only be destructive to the game.

I am enjoying this dispute, and I intend to keep arguing until poor,
benighted Steve can see the error of his ways, but let's keep things 
friendly, can we?

Protoproposal Chaos58 [rev. 6]

Proposals may Order

Be it resolved, that Rule 1794 be amended to read:

      (a) Each Order is of one of the following classes:
        (1) Judicial: A Judicial Order is an Order executed by a
            Player while acting as a Judge.
        (2) Appellate: An Appellate Order is an Order executed by a
            Board of Appeals.
        (3) Administrative: An Administrative Order is an Order
            executed by an Officer in the course of performing the
            duties of that Office, except when those duties involve
            acting as a member of a Board of Appeals.
        (4) Legislative: A Legislative Order is an Order executed as
            part of the effect of the adoption of a Proposal.
        (5) Private: A Private Order is any Order not described above.

      (b) For the purpose of this Rule, the holder of any of the
          following positions shall be considered an Officer when
          performing a duty required by or a privilege permitted only
          by virtue of holding that position:
        (1) the Speaker;
        (2) the Recordkeepor of a Currency; or
        (3) the Trustee of an entity in Probate.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) A Proposal may contain one or more Orders.

      (b) The effect of adopting a Proposal which contains Orders is
          to execute those Orders.  Such Orders are known as
          Legislative Orders, are deemed to have been executed by that
          Proposal, and are deemed to have been executed as of the
          date of the proclamation of the Proposal's adoption.

      (c) Legislative Orders may not be stayed, vacated, or amended
          except:
        (1) by a subsequent Legislative Order;
        (2) by a Judicial Order issued only after a judicial finding
            that the Proposal containing the Legislative Order was not
            adopted, was barred from taking effect, or was invalid; or
        (3) by the Clerk of the Courts, but only for the purpose of
            staying such an Order during the pendency of a dispute
            which might reasonably lead to a judicial finding of the
            sort mentioned in subdivision (c)(2) of this Rule.
