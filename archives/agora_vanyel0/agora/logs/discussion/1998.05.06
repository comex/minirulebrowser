I have no view as yet on this CFJ. Nevertheless, I think there are
flaws in your reasoning below.

This is hardly decisive, as I think you would concede. Certainly the
Rule states that a Player is who *is* Rebellious continually for a
month commits the Infraction, but there's no need to read this as
requiring that the Infraction be reported while the condition is
still true. One would then interpret the provision that the Riotous
Player becomes Abiding merely as saying that this happens if it should
still be the case that e is Rebellious when the Infraction is reported.
Both interpretations seem to me to be available

I think we can agree that Incitement to Riot can only be an Infraction
arising from a failure to act, and concentrate on that. Your argument
concerning how failures to act are to be treated in this is case is,
however, fallacious. There is no reason to read the Riot Act or R1814
as requiring that the entire one month period fall within the period
during which the Riot Act has been in force; it is perfectly
consistent, and I think more appropriate, to describe the failure to
act for which Michael has cited you simply as the failure to become
Abiding, in circumstances in which you had been Rebellious for more
than a month. It is immaterial that a part of that month transpired
before the Riot Act was adopted. Nor is R513 (Authority of Non-Rule
Entities) of any use to you in making your case, if we read the Riot
Act in the way I have suggested, for the text of the Riot Act was
made available to you before it made any requirements of you.

A few R&D folks and editors down at WotC got into an extended discussion last 
week about what it actually means when a card uses the "as though" phrasing 
(i.e. "Walls can attack as though they were not Walls") -- for example, if 
there were a hypothetical card in play that said "Whenever a Wall attacks, 
destroy it at end of turn" should it trigger?

Midway through this discussion it suddenly dawned on me that this was 
parallelling the "legal deeming" discussions held on Agora some time ago.  I 
had a vague recollection of someone writing a long post, essay, or 
dissertation that summarized much of this.  If such a thing does exist, can 
anyone point me to it?

There certainly have been long and complex discussions on the subject
in this forum, from memory largely conducted between, Chuck, Oerjan,
Michael, Scott and myself. But I do not think anyone has ever published
a Thesis on the subject.

I have read a book entirely devoted to the subject: _Legal Fictions_,
by Lon Fuller. Although not perhaps the easiest book in the world to
read and understand, it does provide a pretty thorough overview of the
subject.
