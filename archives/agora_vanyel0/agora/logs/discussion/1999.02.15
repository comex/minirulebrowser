Clean up R.1815

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1815 be amended to read:

      (a) No action is a Crime or an Infraction unless defined as such
          by the Rules.

      (b) If the Rules define an act to be a Crime or an Infraction,
          but fail to prescribe a penalty for that act, then there is
          no penalty for that act.

      (c) If the Rules define an act to be an Infraction, but fail to
          authorize any Player or Players to report instances of that
          Infraction, then that Infraction cannot be reported.

That hardly makes it infeasible. In all the any changes accomplished by
'Spring Cleaning', only one fell foul of this problem. 'Spring Cleaning'
was still a thoroughly worthwhile Proposal for that. (Although the
changes you propose, being purely aesthetic, have a more problematic
merit.)

They may work efficiently in order to leave time to spend with their
families, but that doesn't mean it would be accurate to say that they
spend their time with their families efficiently. 'Raising a family
efficiently' brings to my mind the character of Colonel von Trapp from
'The Sound of Music'.

I try not to have enemies, only disagreements on specific issues. So
far, I've been pretty successful at it. I even managed to work
constructively with KoJen on deregistration due to inactivity, despite
disagreeing with him on just about everything, ever. I've had many more
agreements with you than disagreements so far, and I trust that will
continue to be the case.

Of course, if you want to *make* an enemy of me, by, say, making it your
business to obstruct my every purpose as a matter of principle, then
that's your decision.

Standards of Proof

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1575 be amended to read:

      (a) A CFJ alleging that a Player has violated a Rule or
          committed a Crime shall not be judged TRUE unless the
          evidence is sufficient to be certain of that Judgement
          beyond reasonable doubt.

      (b) In all other CFJs, the Judgement shall be consistent with
          the preponderance of the evidence at hand.

      (c) Furthermore, it is a complete defense to any accusation of a
          Crime that the Player accused, at the time e performed or
          neglected to perform the actions which constitute the Crime
          accused, reasonably believed that the circumstances were
          such that e was legally permitted to perform or neglect to
          perform those acts.  No Player shall be convicted of a Crime
          if this defense applies.

Let the Promotor Exercise Judgment

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1483 be amended to read:

      (a) A Proposal is any document clearly marked as such.

      (b) A Proposal is Proposed when it is posted by a Proposing
          Entity to the Public Forum with the clear indication that it
          is being posted for the purpose of Proposing it.

      (c) A Proposal is not Proposed if, in the Promotor's judgment,
          it is substantially identical to another Proposal Proposed
          within the past three weeks, unless
        (1) the Proposing Entity posting the Proposal clearly
            indicates at the time of posting that the Proposal is
            intended to become a duplicate of the prior Proposal, or
        (2) the prior Proposal has been discarded or withdrawn, or has
            been distributed and the results of voting upon that
            Proposal have been announced by the Assessor.

      (d) The Promotor's determination that a Proposal has or has not
          been Proposed (including a determination made under
          subdivision (c) of this Rule) is subject to judicial review
          only for abuse of discretion.

      (e) Under no circumstance shall the Promotor's distribution of
          previously undistributed Proposals constitute the submission
          of a new Proposal.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Any CFJ which alleges that an Officer made an error
          regarding a determination of fact where the Rules state that
          such determinations shall be subject to judicial review only
          for abuse of discretion lacks standing and shall be
          dismissed.  (Such CFJs, to have standing, must allege that
          the Officer in question abused discretion in making the
          disputed determination.)

      (b) This Rule takes precedence over all other Rules pertaining
          to when a CFJ has standing, and over all other Rules which
          specify when a CFJ shall be dismissed.

Protoproposal Chaos222 [rev. 2]

Eliminate Transfer Orders

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1799 be amended to read:

      Any Order may always be amended, stayed, or vacated by the
      Player (or, in the case of Appellate Orders, Board of Appeal)
      who executed it.  Certain classes of Orders may be amended,
      stayed, or vacated in other circumstances as well, when the
      Rules so allow.  In all cases, this is done by an Order to
      Amend, Stay, or Vacate, respectively, the original Order.

      Otherwise, an Order shall not be amended, stayed, vacated, or
      otherwise changed once executed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1637 be amended to read:

      A Will is an SLC.  The Jurisdiction of a Will is always empty.
      Each Will belongs to exactly one entity.  The Notary shall be
      the Maintainer of all Wills.

      A Will shall specify the heirs of the entity to which it
      belongs, and how the currencies possessed by that entity and its
      other assets will be divided amongst those heirs when that
      entity is placed in Probate.  When an entity's Will is executed,
      the Executor in Probate of that entity will first execute all
      the transfers required by the Will (excepting those which e
      cannot execute or cannot execute successfully, for whatever
      reason), and will then divide the remaining residual assets as
      provided by the Will.

      A Will is created or amended by the Execution of an Application
      to Create a Will.  Such an Application must clearly identify the
      entity to which the Will is to belong, requires the Signature of
      the Executor of the entity to which the Will is to belong, and
      is Executed by submitting it to the Notary.  The effect of
      Executing such an Application is to create a Will belonging to
      that entity.  Any prior Will belonging to that entity is
      destroyed at the same time.

      A Will belonging to an Organization is not an SLC associated to
      that Organization, as defined elsewhere.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1727 be amended, by replacing the
paragraph reading:

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that, not less than seven days prior to
      Agora's Birthday, the Chancellor shall, on behalf of the Bank,
      submit delayed Transfer Orders to be executed at 00:04:30 GMT
      +1200 on Agora's Birthday to each Player for the amount of 3 VTs
      each;

with a paragraph reading

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that, as close to Agora's Birthday as
      possible, the Chancellor shall, on behalf of the Bank, execute
      transfers of 3 VTs to each Player;

and by replacing the paragraph reading:

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Chancellor shall, on behalf of
      the Bank, submit Transfer Orders for one P-note each from the
      Bank to each Player who posts to the Public Forum during Agora's
      Birthday a message recognizing Agora's Birthday; these Transfer
      Orders to be executed as soon as possible after Agora's Birthday
      ends;

with a paragraph reading

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Chancellor shall, on behalf of
      the Bank, execute transfers for one P-note each from the Bank to
      each Player who posts to the Public Forum during Agora's
      Birthday a message recognizing Agora's Birthday; these transfers
      to be executed as soon as possible after Agora's Birthday ends;

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1730 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1732 be amended to read:

      A Payment Order is only satisfied when a transfer to the payee
      of that Payment Order for the currency and amount named in that
      Payment Order is successfully executed, provided that, when that
      transfer was executed, its executor clearly indicated that that
      transfer was being executed for the purpose of satisfying the
      Payment Order in question.

      A given Payment Order can be satisfied at most once.  A vacated
      Payment Order cannot be satisfied.

      A given transfer may be used for the purpose of satisfying at
      most one Payment Order.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1735 be amended to read:

      The Chancellor is the Executor of the Bank.  As soon as possible
      after a Payment Order is executed for which the Bank is the
      payor, the Chancellor shall either (as the Bank's Executor)
      satisfy the Payment Order, or dispute it by making a COE or CFJ.
      However, the Chancellor need not do so if another Player makes
      such a COE or CFJ first.

      If the Chancellor executes a transfer from the Bank for any
      reason other than to satisfy a Payment Order (except when
|     specifically required by the Rules to execute a transfer), e
|     commits the Class A Crime of Misappropriation, and upon
      conviction of this Crime shall be removed from Office.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1817 be amended to read:

      A Recordkeepor is required to record all valid transfers
      executed by the Executor of the owner of the units of Currency
      to be transferred (or, with respect to any entity which lacks an
      Executor, by any other person empowered by the Rules to execute
      transfers on the behalf of such entities), except for those
      transfers which would result in an entity possessing a negative
      quantity of Currency. Transfers shall be noted on the
      Recordkeepor's records in the order in which they are received
      by the Recordkeepor.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1818 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1739 be amended, by replacing the
paragraph reading

      Units of Currency are assigned to an entity by requiring a
      Transfer Order for those Units of Currency from the entity in
      Probate to that Entity.

with one reading

      Units of Currency are assigned to an entity by requiring the
      execution of a transfer of those Units of Currency from the
      entity in Probate to that Entity.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1820 be amended to read:

|     Each Recordkeepor shall maintain a record of all transfers
      executed which specify the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor, for at least four weeks after their execution.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1823 be amended to read:

      If a Player is required to execute two or more Payment Orders,
      all of which name the same Payor, Payee, and Currency, that
      Player may elect to instead execute one Payment Order naming
      that Payor, Payee and Currency, and for an amount equal to the
      sum of all such Payment Orders required.  Doing so satisfies by
      substitution the requirement to execute all such Payment Orders.

      This Rule may not be applied with respect to any Payment Order
      required consequent to the vacation or stay of another Payment
      Order.

      Payment Orders to be executed for the purpose of paying for
      Voting upon Proposals may not be combined by this Rule with
      Payment Orders executed for any other purpose.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1757 be amended to read:

|     (a) The Trustee of an entity in Probate is empowered to execute
|         on behalf of that entity whatever transfers are necessary to
|         implement eir Plan for the disposition of that entity's
|         Estate, as if e were that entity's Executor.  The Trustee
|         may also execute and vacate Payment Orders when necessary to
|         implement the Plan for the disposition of the Estate.
| 
|     (b) The Trustee may exercise the above powers only when
|         implementing a Plan for the disposition of the Estate of the
|         entity in Probate of which e is the Trustee.
| 
|     (c) The Trustee of an entity in Probate ceases to be Trustee
|         when:
|       (1) e announces in the Public Forum that e resigns as Trustee;
|       (2) e ceases to be a Player;
|       (3) the entity of which e is Trustee ceases to be in Probate;
|           or
|       (4) the Notary announces that e has been removed as Trustee.
| 
|     (d) An entity in Probate ceases to be in Probate when its
|         Trustee announces the completion of the implementation of a
|         Plan for the disposition of the Estate of that entity.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1596 be amended to read:

      A Payment Order is an Order requiring an entity (the payor) to
      execute a transfer transferring units of a Currency from itself
      to some other entity (the payee).  A Payment Order specifies
      exactly one source entity, exactly one destination entity,
      exactly one Currency, and a number of units of that Currency
      which is a positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1598 be amended to read:

|     (a) A transfer is valid if:
|       (1) the entity executing it is the Executor of the entity from
|           which the transfer is to be made, or if that entity has no
|           Executor, such other Player as is authorized to execute
|           transfers on behalf of that entity;
|       (2) the transfer is denominated in exactly one Currency;
|       (3) the amount transferred is a positive multiple of that
|           Currency's MUQ;
|       (4) the entity from which the transfer is to be made, prior to
|           that transfer, possesses at least that many units of that
|           Currency; and
|       (5) if the transfer purports to be executed to satisfy a
|           particular Payment, that Payment Order exists and is
|           capable of being satisfied by that transfer.
| 
|     (b) A transfer is executed by submitting a Transfer Notice to
|         the Recordkeepor of the Currency in which it is denominated;
|         this Notice shall set forth:
|       (1) the entity from which the transfer is being made;
|       (2) the entity to which the transfer is being made;
|       (3) the Currency involved;
|       (4) the number of units of Currency being transferred; and
|       (5) the purpose of the transfer, if specification of the
|           purpose of the transfer is necessary to meet with the
|           requirements of another Rule.

Which Proposals do you mean? If you think that the Proposals which are
adopted unanimously are only those which make trivial changes to the
Ruleset, then you are mistaken. Quite sweeping changes have been
adopted unanimously in the past, because excellent arguments for them
have been put forward by their proponents. 

The fact is that controversial Proposals, ie those which generate
disagreement and pass by narrow margins, are rare birds. There certainly
aren't two or three of them a week; one or a month might be a more
accurate estimate. If these are the only Proposals which are actually
put to the vote, the Proposal and voting system will very quickly fall
into complete disuse. There's certainly nothing in Summary Adoption to
prevent this from happening, apart from the determination of 'stick in
the muds' like me to prevent it. Now, for one thing, I may not always be
around, and for a second, considerable political pressure is certain to
be brought to bear upon me to abandon my position if Summary Adoption
passes, pressure I would rather not expend my energy resisting. So it
seems best to me to prevent the Proposal passgin in the first place.

I can't find it in the Rules, but doesn't this mean you have to vacate
apn031 as well?

'therefore'? Because of 'BAH!'? I find that too little of a reason. Better
leave the word out.

I know that. I think I wasn't fully clear. I didn't mean 'BAH!', I meant 
'therefore' as the word that would better be left out. In my dictionary 
'therefore' means 'for that reason', and I see nothing to let it refer to.

I didn't say that all were trivial, although many are. But if
nobody can be bothered to cast VTs against (or for), why
vote at all?

But certainly we could come up with two or three a week. With
less pressure on the queue, it would happen as a matter of course.
Remember, only one objection would be necessary for the SA proposal
to fail. How many proposals truly pass unanimously (i.e. everyone
would vote for if voting were free). Rather few, I think.

No, that's quite reasonably enough - obviously BAH is an abbreviation for
Boothwhips Are Harmful.  Of course, one might not agree with the premise.

I think that the original idea (at least as I understood it) was to
prevent an "invasion" via a large influx of players from another nomic.
To expand the Senate's power beyond what it currently is conversely
decreases the power of new Players--not necessarily a good thing, IMO.

I would also have called attention to the use of the phrase 'I

I apologize for this, by the way.  I neglected to reply to your
message not out of deliberate disregard for it, but out of lack of
time.  Although, to be honest, I don't think my replies would have
been informative because I was planning to refuse to answer many of
your questions because I felt they lacked relevance. :)

I will admit that part of my insistence was motivated by a desire to
see the issue go to CFJ.  We need more CFJs, especially now that the
Proposal system is badly compromised as a way to make new law.

But surely the CFJ rules, as they now stand, are a poor way to
make new law. A Judge has very little leeway on interpretation,
except perhaps in cases like this one where the Rules are silent.

The Rules are silent whenever a Judge says they are. :)

I agree with you, Steve, that Summary Adoption is not the right mechanism
for many proposals, but I think there is a certain subset of Proposal 
for which it would be appropriate. We have long faced the problem of 
not having a good way to do "Disinterested" proposals - minor bug-fixes
or aesthetic changes to the ruleset that everybody supports, but which 
are not really important enough to warrant spending votes on. I think 
the Summary Adoption system is perfectly appropriate for these proposals.
If they are truly non-contraversial, then they will not receive any 
objections.

I also will be a 'stick in the mud', and object to summary adoption of an
"substantive" proposal, regardless of how popular it is. I don't think
you really need to be afraid that masses of proposals will suddenly 
start being adopted in this way. All it would take would be for a few
of us to resist such proposals for a time, and soon enough a culture would
form as to which proposals are appropriate to be Summarily Adopted, and
which are not.

Otherwise, the only reasonable argument you have placed against allowing
such "non-substantive" proposals to be passed summarily is that you'd 
rather that their author's be forced to spend money on them, so they take
part in the economy. I understand you're sentiment, but I think it is not
going to work. It's just too annoying and boring to have to put all that
effort into getting a minor change passed. Even if you collect a whole
heap of them together, it is still a chore, and it only slows down the
development of the game. Let's save the politicking for the proposals that
we really care about.

Please Steve, see reason. Summary Adoption is not the threat you think it
is. It'll let us get the little things done easily, without abandoning the
challenge of getting more important proposals through. Perhaps you have 
some suggestions for a better way of achieving this? I note that the 
existing SA proposal did not prevent R833 from awarding P-Notes to the
Proposer. I think this should be changed. All Summarily Adopted proposals
ought to be disinterested, imho.

Perhaps we should add some risk to it? If you're proposal isn't adopted,
then it loses 1 point of Priority? Or, if we required that only Disinterested
proposals can be SA'ed, then the proposer would have to relinquish the
chance to get eir P-Notes refunded, if someone objects and it has to go
through normal channels.

Simpler Changing of the Voting Tariff

Be it resolved, that Rule 1682 be amended to read:

The Voting Tariff is a number of VTs, a multiple of the MUQ for VTs,
between 0 and 2 inclusive.  The Assessor may set the Voting Tariff to
any value in this range at any time by announcing the change in the
Public Forum; the change takes effect 72 hours after it is announced. 
Until the Promotor sets another value, the Voting Tariff is 1 VT.

Protoproposal Chaos223 [rev. 1]

Revamp the Promotor's Office

Be it resolved, that Rules 109, 1036, 1839, 1770, 1771, 1772, 1773 and
1774 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) A Proposal enters the Proposal Queue when it is received
          from a Proposing Entity by the Promotor.

      (b) A Proposal leaves the Proposal Queue when it is distributed,
          withdrawn, or discarded, or when the Rules otherwise require
          it.

      (c) The Promotor may, by Public Forum Announcement, discard any
          Proposal in the Proposal Queue which was Proposed over a
          month previously and which has zero or negative Priority.

      (d) The Proposer of a Proposal in the Queue may, by Public Forum
          Announcement, remove that Proposal from the Queue.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Each Proposal in the Proposal Queue has a priority.
        (1) When a Proposal enters the Proposal Queue, it has a
            priority of zero.
        (2) Any Player may, by Public Forum Announcement, increase or
            decrease the Priority of a Proposal in the Proposal Queue
            by any amount provided that e simultaneously transfers to
            the Bank a number of P-Notes equal to the magnitude of the
            change e wishes to make, and that transfer is not made for
            any other purpose.
        (3) At most once in each week, the Promotor may, by Public
            Forum Announcement, increase by one the Priority of any
            Proposal in the Proposal Queue, provided that the Proposal
            was not Proposed by emself.
        (4) At the beginning of each month, the priority of all
            Proposals in the Proposal Queue which were proposed over a
            month previously is decreased by one.  The Promotor shall
            report all such changes as soon as possible after the
            beginning of the month.

      (b) Proposals in the Proposal Queue are sorted in Queue Order by
          ordering them by descending Priority; Proposals with the
          same Priority are ordered by increasing time in the Proposal
          Queue.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Each week, the Promotor shall select from the Proposal Queue
          and distribute a number of Proposals equal to that week's
          Proposal Limit.
        (1) The Proposal Limit for a given week shall be the lesser
            of:
          (A) the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue with
              Priority greater than zero at the time of the first
              distribution of Proposals in that week; and
          (B) the Maximum Proposal Limit in effect at the start of
              that week.
        (2) Proposals shall be selected for distribution from the head
            of the Proposal Queue, in descending Queue Order.

      (b) The Maximum Proposal Limit is an integer between two and
          six, inclusive.  The Promotor may set the Maximum Proposal
          Limit to any value in this range at any time by announcing
          the change in the Public Forum; the change takes effect 72
          hours after it is announced.  Until the Promotor sets
          another value, the Maximum Proposal Limit is three.

      (c) At the time the Promotor distributes a Proposal, e shall
          give it a unique identifier for reference.  No Proposal may
          be given the same identifier which was previously assigned
          to any other Proposal

      (d) The Promotor shall endeavor to distribute all of the
          Proposals required to be distributed in a given week at one
          time; however, supplemental distributions are permitted only
          within the same week if, for some reason, the previous
          distribution(s) in that week do not exhaust that week's
          Proposal Limit.

      (e) A message is a Proposal Distribution only if it claims
          explicitly to be so.  The message distributing a Proposal
          must set forth its exact text, and should also set forth the
          unique identifier assigned it by the Promotor, the identity
          of its Proposing Entity, and its requested Adoption Index. 
          Any error in the text of a distribution Proposal renders its
          distribution void, as is a second or subsequent distribution
          of a Proposal previously distributed.  An error in any other
          part of a distribution has no effect on the validity of that
          distribution.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) The Promotor shall publish the Proposal Queue weekly. This
          publication shall set forth, for each Proposal then in the
          Proposal Queue, in Queue Order:
        (1) a unique identifier assigned to it by the Promotor;
        (2) its Title;
        (3) its current priority; and
        (4) the date and time when it was Proposed.

      (b) This publication shall also describe any changes to the
          Priorities of the Proposals in the Queue and the reasons
          therefore.  This publication need not contain the text of
          Proposals in the Queue.

Hi, Steve--

Well, I was marginally in favor of it, meaning that while I wasn't willing
to spend my scarce VTs on it, I would not mind it passing.

All Scott's other proposals lately seem to fall into two categories:
'reformatting' proposals whose sheer number and boringness defies belief,
and the massive 'revamp everything' proposals which (history teaches) are
almost a guarantee of major trouble.  So I was a little sad to see the one
reasonable-looking try from that source go down to narrow defeat.  If I
could have helped it along with 0.1 VT, I would have.

I admit that I've contributed to the moribundity of The Threat, mainly due
to my return to America and resumption of actual work.  But I enjoy reading
the list, and occasionally throwing my $0.02, or the odd Judgement.  I
really need to get some VTs  before I think about voting, though.

Anyhow, I just thought I'd write to clarify my position and let you know
that I haven't forgotten you.

Regards,
-- elJefe

I apologize for this, by the way.  I neglected to reply to your
message not out of deliberate disregard for it, but out of lack of
time.  Although, to be honest, I don't think my replies would have
been informative because I was planning to refuse to answer many of
your questions because I felt they lacked relevance. :)

I will admit that part of my insistence was motivated by a desire to
see the issue go to CFJ.  We need more CFJs, especially now that the
Proposal system is badly compromised as a way to make new law.

But surely the CFJ rules, as they now stand, are a poor way to
make new law. A Judge has very little leeway on interpretation,
except perhaps in cases like this one where the Rules are silent.

I agree with you, Steve, that Summary Adoption is not the right mechanism
for many proposals, but I think there is a certain subset of Proposal 
for which it would be appropriate. We have long faced the problem of 
not having a good way to do "Disinterested" proposals - minor bug-fixes
or aesthetic changes to the ruleset that everybody supports, but which 
are not really important enough to warrant spending votes on. I think 
the Summary Adoption system is perfectly appropriate for these proposals.
If they are truly non-contraversial, then they will not receive any 
objections.

I also will be a 'stick in the mud', and object to summary adoption of an
"substantive" proposal, regardless of how popular it is. I don't think
you really need to be afraid that masses of proposals will suddenly 
start being adopted in this way. All it would take would be for a few
of us to resist such proposals for a time, and soon enough a culture would
form as to which proposals are appropriate to be Summarily Adopted, and
which are not.

Otherwise, the only reasonable argument you have placed against allowing
such "non-substantive" proposals to be passed summarily is that you'd 
rather that their author's be forced to spend money on them, so they take
part in the economy. I understand you're sentiment, but I think it is not
going to work. It's just too annoying and boring to have to put all that
effort into getting a minor change passed. Even if you collect a whole
heap of them together, it is still a chore, and it only slows down the
development of the game. Let's save the politicking for the proposals that
we really care about.

Please Steve, see reason. Summary Adoption is not the threat you think it
is. It'll let us get the little things done easily, without abandoning the
challenge of getting more important proposals through. Perhaps you have 
some suggestions for a better way of achieving this? I note that the 
existing SA proposal did not prevent R833 from awarding P-Notes to the
Proposer. I think this should be changed. All Summarily Adopted proposals
ought to be disinterested, imho.

Perhaps we should add some risk to it? If you're proposal isn't adopted,
then it loses 1 point of Priority? Or, if we required that only Disinterested
proposals can be SA'ed, then the proposer would have to relinquish the
chance to get eir P-Notes refunded, if someone objects and it has to go
through normal channels.

Protoproposal Chaos228 [rev. 1]

Simpler Changing of the Voting Tariff

Be it resolved, that Rule 1682 be amended to read:

The Voting Tariff is a number of VTs, a multiple of the MUQ for VTs,
between 0 and 2 inclusive.  The Assessor may set the Voting Tariff to
any value in this range at any time by announcing the change in the
Public Forum; the change takes effect 72 hours after it is announced. 
Until the Promotor sets another value, the Voting Tariff is 1 VT.

Protoproposal Chaos223 [rev. 1]

Revamp the Promotor's Office

Be it resolved, that Rules 109, 1036, 1839, 1770, 1771, 1772, 1773 and
1774 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) A Proposal enters the Proposal Queue when it is received
          from a Proposing Entity by the Promotor.

      (b) A Proposal leaves the Proposal Queue when it is distributed,
          withdrawn, or discarded, or when the Rules otherwise require
          it.

      (c) The Promotor may, by Public Forum Announcement, discard any
          Proposal in the Proposal Queue which was Proposed over a
          month previously and which has zero or negative Priority.

      (d) The Proposer of a Proposal in the Queue may, by Public Forum
          Announcement, remove that Proposal from the Queue.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Each Proposal in the Proposal Queue has a priority.
        (1) When a Proposal enters the Proposal Queue, it has a
            priority of zero.
        (2) Any Player may, by Public Forum Announcement, increase or
            decrease the Priority of a Proposal in the Proposal Queue
            by any amount provided that e simultaneously transfers to
            the Bank a number of P-Notes equal to the magnitude of the
            change e wishes to make, and that transfer is not made for
            any other purpose.
        (3) At most once in each week, the Promotor may, by Public
            Forum Announcement, increase by one the Priority of any
            Proposal in the Proposal Queue, provided that the Proposal
            was not Proposed by emself.
        (4) At the beginning of each month, the priority of all
            Proposals in the Proposal Queue which were proposed over a
            month previously is decreased by one.  The Promotor shall
            report all such changes as soon as possible after the
            beginning of the month.

      (b) Proposals in the Proposal Queue are sorted in Queue Order by
          ordering them by descending Priority; Proposals with the
          same Priority are ordered by increasing time in the Proposal
          Queue.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Each week, the Promotor shall select from the Proposal Queue
          and distribute a number of Proposals equal to that week's
          Proposal Limit.
        (1) The Proposal Limit for a given week shall be the lesser
            of:
          (A) the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue with
              Priority greater than zero at the time of the first
              distribution of Proposals in that week; and
          (B) the Maximum Proposal Limit in effect at the start of
              that week.
        (2) Proposals shall be selected for distribution from the head
            of the Proposal Queue, in descending Queue Order.

      (b) The Maximum Proposal Limit is an integer between two and
          six, inclusive.  The Promotor may set the Maximum Proposal
          Limit to any value in this range at any time by announcing
          the change in the Public Forum; the change takes effect 72
          hours after it is announced.  Until the Promotor sets
          another value, the Maximum Proposal Limit is three.

      (c) At the time the Promotor distributes a Proposal, e shall
          give it a unique identifier for reference.  No Proposal may
          be given the same identifier which was previously assigned
          to any other Proposal

      (d) The Promotor shall endeavor to distribute all of the
          Proposals required to be distributed in a given week at one
          time; however, supplemental distributions are permitted only
          within the same week if, for some reason, the previous
          distribution(s) in that week do not exhaust that week's
          Proposal Limit.

      (e) A message is a Proposal Distribution only if it claims
          explicitly to be so.  The message distributing a Proposal
          must set forth its exact text, and should also set forth the
          unique identifier assigned it by the Promotor, the identity
          of its Proposing Entity, and its requested Adoption Index. 
          Any error in the text of a distribution Proposal renders its
          distribution void, as is a second or subsequent distribution
          of a Proposal previously distributed.  An error in any other
          part of a distribution has no effect on the validity of that
          distribution.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) The Promotor shall publish the Proposal Queue weekly. This
          publication shall set forth, for each Proposal then in the
          Proposal Queue, in Queue Order:
        (1) a unique identifier assigned to it by the Promotor;
        (2) its Title;
        (3) its current priority; and
        (4) the date and time when it was Proposed.

      (b) This publication shall also describe any changes to the
          Priorities of the Proposals in the Queue and the reasons
          therefore.  This publication need not contain the text of
          Proposals in the Queue.

                    Personal e-note, not via the list

Hi, Steve--

Well, I was marginally in favor of it, meaning that while I wasn't willing
to spend my scarce VTs on it, I would not mind it passing.

All Scott's other proposals lately seem to fall into two categories:
'reformatting' proposals whose sheer number and boringness defies belief,
and the massive 'revamp everything' proposals which (history teaches) are
almost a guarantee of major trouble.  So I was a little sad to see the one
reasonable-looking try from that source go down to narrow defeat.  If I
could have helped it along with 0.1 VT, I would have.

I admit that I've contributed to the moribundity of The Threat, mainly due
to my return to America and resumption of actual work.  But I enjoy reading
the list, and occasionally throwing my $0.02, or the odd Judgement.  I
really need to get some VTs  before I think about voting, though.

Anyhow, I just thought I'd write to clarify my position and let you know
that I haven't forgotten you.

Regards,
-- elJefe
