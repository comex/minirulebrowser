Can't you just piggy back onto the existing Orders mechanism?

Well, yes and no. Transfer Orders are specifically for currencies,
so it would take a bit of hacking to make them apply to Plots also.
Or else I produce a new kind of Order, much like TOs, which apply to
Plots.

Also, there might be a need for POs as well. If a Transfer Order is
carried out, then is vacated at a later date, a reverse TO is made. If
there are insufficient funds, a PO is issued. I don't see any other 
reasonable way to handle this. Any ideas?

This is just a gentle, non-Official reminder to Chancellor Michael
that he is in violation of R1023 (via R1735) in respect of the Payment
Orders for P-Notes below:

POP277 22May98 07:18:22      1 Bank            Steve          Assessor
POP278 22May98 07:18:22      2 Bank            Steve          Assessor

I only mention it because I have been waiting anxiously to be paid
these P-Notes so that I can use them to increase the Priority of
several of my Proposals in the Queue. I've already missed this
Week's distribution.

I wasn't suggesting you use Transfer Orders specifically. Just make
new kind of Order, like a Transfer of Deed. The point is that the
disputation and vacation mechanisms are already there and don't need
to be duplicated.

I think you are leaping to conclusions.  Why not use a system along
the lines of the one that Swann instituted for Points?  If someone
says that they are performing a transfer and it is a legitimate
transfer, then the Cartographor is required to adjust their records,
and the transfer is considered done.  Further require that the
Chancellor can only make transfers as and when the Rules explicitly
require this.

To avoid excessive Platonism, you must define the system so that the
Cartographor does not need to make any sophisticated semantic
decisions as to whether or not something is valid, and further, hold
that a transfer does not happen until recorded. 

If Players come to an agreement requiring the transfer of Plots and
one or other Player doesn't play ball, then the Courts can judge there
to be a problem and impose penalties in Currencies, and/or order the
Cartographor to record a transfer.

Basically, the system should have as its central principle that the
Cartographor can only record transfers that are explicitly allowed for
in the rules.  These transfer classes would include: 

  i) personal transfers, where an Executor of an Entity other than the
     Chancellor wrt the Bank orders the transfer of a Plot in their
     ownership. 
 ii) Bank/Crown transfers required by the rules.  These would include
     purchase of Plots, and mandatory reclaiming of Plots at the end
     of the game. 
iii) Transfers ordered by the judicial system.  These would arise from
     the calling of a CFJ.  

You can avoid POs because the notion of sending someone a bill doesn't
really have an analogy in the domain of land possession.  Perhaps this
has something to do with the fact that land is not a fungible
commodity. 

Michael.

When Macross registered, he ordered Swann to vacate all of his orders,
and further forbade him from issuing any further orders.  

Why hasn't Swann done so?  I haven't been following the arguments very
closely.

Not all of them, and Swann vacated those he was Ordered to. And
afterwards he only amended existing Orders rather than issue new
ones.

I vacated all the Orders I was Ordered to Vacate.  E also left a hole
where I was allowed to Order amendments to the Orders I didn't Vacate. 
It is my opinion that e issued no subsequent Orders.

I'm starting to think that Transfer Orders should not be Orders, but
should be something else instead.

I don't think there was one. Myself, I'm satisifed that Swann's
amendments were valid, though, on the strength of my theory
that Orders are NREs.

AFAIK, the last set of amendments may still be in dispute.  I believe
theat Macross never actually made the Order forbidding me to issue non-
palindromic Orders, but Macross doesn't.

That may be more radical than nescesary.  IMO what needs reform is the
effects of vacating an Order (A TO in particular).  In my Order fix
Proto I've specified that vacating a satisfied Order has no effect in
and of itself.  (ie. Vacation doesn't implicitly or explicitly reverse
actions)  And I amended the duties of the Recordkeepor simply to issue a
PO reversing TOs that were vacated in a timely fashion.  This does add a
delay into this process, but we seem to be coping with the delays
serving every other PO, so I don't think it's too onerous a burden.

I think the problem isn't in a TO being an Order, it's in the way the
currency rules attempt to deal with mistakes, which is rather oddball
and inelegant.

The vacation issue is only part of the problem.  The other problem I'm
having is that Transfer Orders are the most common sort of Private
Order that are not consequent to an agreement between Players.  I'm
starting to think that "Transfer Memos" would be more appropriate.
Transfer Orders are rather different from all other Orders heretofore
contemplated, you will have to agree.  The concept should be
generalizable to Kudo transfers, Plot transfers, and even Voting.

I fail to see the point.  Such orders will be invalid upon review, and
you cannot be penalized for failing to abide by an order found invalid
upon review.  The point of presumptive validity is to relieve
administrative officers from having to making judicial
determinations--and the conditions you propose do _EXACTLY THAT_.
Under the regime you suggest, the recipient of an Order must make a
(judicial) determination of validity before e can know whether or not
he has to act on that Order.  Since, in many cases, performing an
Ordered action without a valid Order may be itself illegal, this
creates a rather unpleasant situation for Officers (especially
Currency Recordkeepors, but I imagine others as well).  Criterion iii
of your conditions is especially onerous in this regard: it can be a
very complicated matter to determine whether an Order is "in direct
violation of one or more Rules."

This proposal completely guts presumptive validity, and I will
aggressively oppose it.

Perhaps in purpose, but-- I don't think-- in nature.  If it is the
oddity of having TOs as private Orders, perhaps there should be (instead
of a wholly new entity) a new class of order-- a Transaction Order, that
would be generalizable in the way you intend.

IMO, the idea of TO's aren't antithetical to the Order concept.  I'd
like to think that the Scoring rules shows a way they could be used. The
whole scoring system was pre-Order, but I think manages to work with
the Order paradigm, not against it.  Those rules were my attempt to
draft how I believe the currency Rules (and Kudos) could operate on a
truly pragmatic basis. (The Scoring system, in fact, was a more-or-less
stripped-down implementation of my more general Object proposal.  Me
figuring it would be easier to get the system voted into place with a
new (old) entity than it had been to revamp the existing Currency
system.)

Not unless a rule specifies that they're invalid.  That's the current
problem.

But until that review, the order is de-facto "valid," which means that
an Order can prevent its own legal review, unless such a provision makes
the Order invalid.

Officers have the protection you want, a good faith clause, which we
have in Rule 1798.  1798, IMO, protects Officers from this problem you
see.  Obeying an invalid Order is not a problem for the person Ordered.

I think that there are situations were an Order *needs* to be invalid on
it's face.  Now, perhaps you're right that iii) may be over broad.  But
you seem to rely, as a protection, on the ability of Players to
disregard invalid Orders and not be penalized.  Disregarding Orders is a
Crime, and I believe your option of ignoring a Order is forcing those
Ordered to make the judicial determinations you want to avoid.  

The arguement seems at cross purpose with itself here--
a) All Orders should be presumtivly valid because an improper order will
be adjudicated invalid and no one is liable to Obey it.
b) All Orders should be presumtivly valid because no Player other than a
Judge should make a judicial decision on whether an Order is Valid or
not.

Argument b essentially renders the "protection" of argument a completly
moot.  If no one is making judicial determinations, all Orders should be
treated the same and carried out because they should be treated as
valid.  Anyone who disobeys *any* presumtivly valid Order is making a--
probably dangerous-- judicial determination.  Protection a is no real
protection, unless you can *guarentee* that the courts will agree with
you. If they don't, you're committing a Class C crime with no defense. 
If I were, right now, order the Herald to Vacate all my Blots-- what
should the Herald do?  Is there any way that the Herald can act without
making a Judicial determination of eir own, since the Courts will
probably not act before the Tabulator would be required to?  What if the
Tabulator does not record the vacation of my Blots, and the Courts find
that this was an error?

My point is, the only safe way for an Officer to behave in a situation
where all Orders are presumtivly valid is to obey all the Orders
directed at eim.  This works, and relieves the burden of Officerdom, but
it is dangerous without a limited number of cases excluded from this
presumptive validity.

Minor nit: a Board of Appeals, not the Board of Appeals.

But if the TO was in satisfaction of a PO, vacating the TO
still doesn't "unsatisfy" the PO.  (Unless this was in another
Rule which I missed.)  Also, it seems to me aesthetically distasteful
to have this exception to the "vacating a satisfied order has no
effect" Rule.  I would instead allow Players to issue the reverse
POs themselves, in certain cases; something like this (just off
the top of my head)

      When a Player has issued a Transfer Order, and stated the
      desired effect of that Order along with the Order, then, if
      the Transfer Order does not have the desired effect, the Player
      is premitted to issue, not later than two weeks after the
      Transfer Order was issued, a Payment Order for the amount
      and currency of the Transfer Order, and with the Payor and
      Payee interchanged.

It needs to be cleaned up a bit, as I think in this version "desired
effect" is too vague, but you get the idea.

I have made an effort, in the Coup d'etat scam, to conduct myself in a
way to avoid inflaming the passions of the public against me.  Past
scams of similar scope and intent, I believe, have shown the necessity
of caution in this regard.  Now I have stated before my intents in this
scam, but I will repeat them now explicitly, since I want to know if the
Players have problems with the way I intend to conduct myself.

I) I intend to propose the Order fixes I've protoed with some additional
changes suggested by Chuck and General Chaos.

II) Added to the proposal will be a power 3 Rule that will vacate Blots
on myself and Macross, grant me and Macross one win apiece, make May 1 a
holiday in remembrance of the Coup, and give me and Macross appropriate
Titles (Me: "Temporary Despot," Macross "The Opposition.") it will also
pay out 1 VT to every Player for reasons that will become apparent.

III) With the proposal up for vote, I intend to amend my Orders to Order
every Player to vote FOR this Proposal and refrain from voting AGAINST--
this is the reason for the VT payout, to compensate the Players for this
Order.

I am announcing this because, even though I have the capacity to wield
this power, I do not want to instigate a situation that will result in
ill feelings.  Bearing in mind the nature of scams, and of the hole I am
both exploiting and attempting to fix, how would the players regard
these plans of mine?  Especially, is there anyone who would find step
III too egregious or painful to bear?  I don't want this to suffer the
fate of the Mousetrap, inspiring a flood of deregistrations-- but please
bear in mind, also, that this is a significant scam and I feel it should
be recognized.

On a related note; I am considering forming a Contest whose sole purpose
would be to submit the Order fix proposal.  I was wondering if Macross--
or anyone else-- would be interested in signing an Application to allow
this.  (Splitting the rewards amongst the signatories.)

 I dunno... That would amount to calling the scam successful, I suppose,
but I'm not sure it's been conclusively shown that it was. In particular,
I want to see a definitive Judgement on 1096, and if that is established
we might come to some interesting conclusions.

 I for one wouldn't comply. It is my opinion that the Rules grant me
the right to vote FOR or AGAINST, or declare presence, or not Vote at
all, and that any attempt to prohibit one of these choices is in
conflict with the Rules; and I am further of the opinion that
attempting to coerce me to Vote a given way on a Proposal is less
morally justified than a willful violation of the Rules to avoid
same would be. Lastly, I believe that the Proposal as you outline
it would be outlawed by a suitably broad interpretation of 1561.

That's certianly a thought. I'll see about working something like this
into the final proposal.

Actually, I only Ordered him to vacate some of his Orders.  If I recall
correctly, e vacated the Orders almost immediately. It's possible that
e is in violation of my palindrome Order however.  That of course will
depend on whether or not I actually issued that Order.  I think I'm going
to CFJ on that.

Exactly why I said in my orignal post that "desired effect" was
too vague.

My opinion is that you did indeed issue that Order, but placed 
yourself under penalty of Contempt by doing so. And Swann
has, since then, repeatedly committed the same offense.

Swann's arguments to the contrary notwithstanding, I believe that
when you stated "If it is legal for me to do so, I hereby order
Swann to etc." you were acting within your Rule-granted rights
to issue Private Orders; the fact that doing so could have been
Contempt is an indirect consideration with, as far as I'm concerned,
no bearing on the presumed validity of such an Order.
