<Quick scan>.  Yup, you're right, Blob's vote is not there.  That'll
be because I posted that list before I had read Blob's e-mail message.
My results post to agora-official does include his vote however.  

Thankfully, it didn't make any difference. 

Michael.

BTW, Steve's prediction is almost realized - I believe Jester's the

I don't know if everyone else has voted in all of the Elections, but I
think they probably did. 

It was definitely a good turnout.  Kudos to the Agoran public.

Well, that's it. Not only does the Threat win most elections straight
away, they also don't yield anything where they could (who would
expect anything else from them, I ask?). In addition, the real life
elections in Germany last sunday went all wrong, too, and this morning
I had to walk through the rain for half an hour because public
transport was on strike. I'm off to the Beer Hall (Cartographor,
please note!) to join the others - the origin's become a pretty lonely
place anyway - and, once there, I rebel.

<rant off>

BTW, I wonder what the "month" is that must have passed since the last
revolution for a new one to succeed: 28 days? the next month's day
with the same number? 31 days?

That's not quite the case yet. The Speaker still has to cast a 
deciding vote in the Archivist and Chancellor Elections, both tied 
between a Threat candidate and an unaligned one.

This seems to be quite in the spirit of these Elections, by the way;
it is the first time since we've had elected Officers that the
Speaker has had so many tie-breaking Votes to cast.

[ Here's my first real attempt at a Proposal.  Let me know what you
  think.  Also, I considered the Title "Scallywag", but thought that
  might be a little over the top.]

Proto-Proposal - Sherlock #1
----------------------------

Let a rule be created with the title "The Miscreant" and with the
following text:

      Let there exist the Patent Title of "Miscreant".

      If any Player has more ten Blots, the Player with the most 
      Blots earns the Title of Miscreant.  If no Player has the most
      number of Blots, there is no Miscreant.  The Miscreant loses
      eir Title of Miscreant when another Player gains more Blots 
      than em.
       
      A Player with the Title Miscreant counts as two Players towards 
      the tally needed for Rebellion.  If a Rebellion occurs in which
      the Miscreant was a Rebel, the Miscreant then loses all Blot in
      eir possession and the Title of Miscreant is revoked from em.

Yes, and I agree that these elections were the most fascinating and
fun ones I have seen in my half year or so of playing here.

Please note that my remarks (quoted above) were meant and marked as
non-serious ranting to add a bit of coulour to my rebellion. (And,
I'll admit that much, they were meant to put some pressure on the
speaker to consider favoring some non-Threat candidates in breaking
the ties, because otherwise the electorate will be getting restless
and rebellious.)

Moreover, unless someone currently rebelling becomes abiding in the
next ten days we will have another rebellion on 13 March (more
elections).  (Kolja, my intuition about Game Custom says that "a month
later" means in the next month, on the same date.  Game Custom hasn't
had to cope with the 31st of the month yet.)

Also, I don't think you have any right to complain (however
un-seriously) about Steve's decision, as Speaker or as a member of
the Threat. You yourself are a member of a Group, all of whose
members are experienced Agorans; the I submit that if the OOEE had
been intent on influencing the results of these recent Elections to
the extent Threat was, the results could have been even more
interesting.

As it is, the Threat's position of power - that is, assuming that the
Threat Group as a whole does have any particular agenda in which
holding these Offices plays a part - was attained quite legally and 
democratically. I will admit that the Revolt/Delegation dodge, had it 
worked, could have been viewed otherwise, but then again it didn't 
work.

That said, if there are any Players out there - unaligned, X or OOEE 
members - who are interested in forming a new Group to provide an 
opposing power to the Threat's supposed hegemony, I would like to 
invite you to contact me with your notion of what such a Group's 
statutes and agenda should be. I would be interested in forming some 
sort of an opposition party, as well as further exploring Agoran 
party politics.

DIS: Proto: The Miscreant

Not a bad first effort.  8)  The only technical problem I see is the "loses all
Blots" wording.  Since "Blot" is just shorthand for "outstanding Indulgence
Payment Order", it would be better to make it explicit that these Blots are
"vacated" rather than "lost".  Also, in keeping with the spirit of PC
(Pragmatic Currencies, for the newbies), it would be better if one of the
Officers would be responsible for the vacation of these Blots.  E.g., "If a
Rebellion occurs in which the Miscreant was a Rebel, the Registrar shall vacate
all Blots in the possession of the Miscreant at the time of the Rebellion..."
or for the purists "...all Indulgence Payment Orders, with the Miscreant as
payor, that were outstanding at the time of the Rebellion...".

Let a rule be created with the title "The Miscreant" and with the

      If any Player has more ten Blots, the Player with the most

      A Player with the Title Miscreant counts as two Players towards 
      the tally needed for Rebellion.  If a Rebellion occurs in which
      the Miscreant was a Rebel, the Miscreant then loses all Blot in
      eir possession and the Title of Miscreant is revoked from em.

I like it.  Use whatever term you like, but "miscreant" is fine by
me.   A couple of typos.  This does rather duplicate the Risky
Rebellion idea, but it is actually quite a nice way of conveying the
same sort of flavour without a radical overhaul of the rebellion
rules. 
 
Just a couple of typos below:

IMO, it always the right of members in losing "Groups" to complain about
winning "Groups".  8)

[ All right, here's the revised version, taking account of Michael and
  Crito's comments.  I hope the latter does not mind, but I lifted the
  last sentence directly from his suggested correction. ]

      the Miscreant was a Rebel, the Registrar shall vacate all Blots

I think it is still a bit unclear what happens in the case of ties.
Can there be more than one Miscreant?

Again, I agree. But alas, we were not organized and rich enough...

I don't mind the results of the elections too much, really. But I
observe that a very interesting shift of perpective has happened
during these elections, because all of a sudden the group aspect
entered: so far the (or at least my personal) perception of officers
has been that they are mainly doing the Agora community a favor by
doing their duties, and that I'd happily see anyone elected if I can
expect that they'll do their job (which was the case for all
candidates in the last elections, I dare say). 

But recent changes (more real power to officers, and the scarcity of
currencies) have made holding office much more attractive as opposed
to a sacrifice of time and effort (which it still is, of course). I
don't think this development is just a coincidence - it was one of the
wanted effects of scarce currencies and more power to the officers;
and I'm delighted and consider it as a success that the game is moving
towards a more political athmosphere, with real competition for
offices, groups and factions, wheeling and dealing...

Unless you have good reason to believe otherwise, it does not seem to
me that requiring the Registrar to vacate Indulgence POs necessarily
gives them the authority to do so.  Language used in other rules uses
the phrasing "is authorised and required to", and I suggest this might
also be adopted here.

Rule 1734 is a pretty good reason.  Well, except it uses "only if", which
I just a while ago argued does _not_ imply "if".  Sigh.

Good point.  I take it all back.

My only problem is how to conserve the closed system of Indulgences with
this. I don't know how well said system is working now (could someone fill
me in?) but I do think we should try to make it work. Any thoughts on how
to make this proto work correctly in such a system?

If it had worked, it would have been legal; I'll admit to there being
some question as to its democratic nature.  However, Threat victories
in recent Elections most definitely cannot be said to be anything
other than democratic.  

As far as a Threat agenda, in general I would say that our only agenda
is to make the Game more interesting.  I would like to think that our
participation in recent events have furthered that goal.  Finally, a
party system is evolving -- and without any legislation whatsoever.
(The Threat's Group status is not essential to its role as the nucleus
of the present Ruling Party.)  The question becomes, what issue pair
will the opposition exploit to build the necessary coalition of
minorities to overthrow us?  :)

Whee, what fun.  Exposes a problem with the Rebellion rule, if you ask
me, when Officers Elected by a majority can be deposed by a minority,
only to (in theory) be reelected by the same majority.  I think an
amendment to Rebellion is in order...

I would hold that "a month later" means the next month, same day of
month; if no such day exists, the first day of the next following
month.  So one month from December 15th is January 15th, and one month
from January 31st is March 1st.

Sounds reasonable.  An alternative would be the last day of the next
month; that way at least the action comes in the next month, and is
still guaranteed to be at least four weeks later.

<<

Instead of requiring some officer to vacate the blots, the same
officer could be required to pay out the corresponding number of
indulgences. Of course, the bank might then be stuck with a PO it
cannot fulfill... I'm not sure what to do in this case. Make it
several POs from the bank to the Miscreant, so the bank can pay them

My recent proto to suspend Indulgence distributions until the supply is less
than the demand should work here too.  It doesn't conserve things immediately,
but it does bring the system back to it's "scarcity" state eventually as Blots
are handed out.

My only problem is how to conserve the closed system of Indulgences with
this. I don't know how well said system is working now (could someone fill
me in?) but I do think we should try to make it work. Any thoughts on how
to make this proto work correctly in such a system?

Well, if we wanted to be mean, I could re-write it so that instead of
destroying the Miscreant's Blots, they could instead be re-distributed
among all other players randomly.  I'm assuming most of you wouldn't
like that, though. :)

A dangerous assumption.

Although that should of course be among all abiding players.

It seems that the Electorate is Rebellious anyways: we now have 
enough Rebellious Players to trigger a Revolt as soon as the one
month limit is passed, and this is even before I've made any 
decisions concerning the Archivist and Chancellor Elections.

I quite like it, and it would work okay with the Risky Rebellion proto,
althought the Blot vacation would be duplicated. I am going to propose
RR soon, I'm just waiting to see if Steve's Speaker Transition prop 
passes. I suggest that we make the two work together.

I'll just observe that there are a hell of a lot of Indulgences around,
and not many Blots.

Sounds good to me.  Tell me what I need to change in order for them to

Change R1664 so that a Revolt is triggerred by a majority of Players,
obviously. One might object to this on the grounds that if a majority
of Players desires anything in particular, it can always pass a
Proposal. That's true, but there's still the question of mechanism.
Passing a Proposal requires resources, the expenditure of political
capital, not to mention P-notes and VTs, and holding a coalition
together during the VP. A Revolt triggerred by a majority of Players
would still be a hell of lot easier politically that getting a
Proposal passed, and therefore still makes conceptual sense.

Everyone except Jester voted in the first 6 Elections, and the 
Justiciar Election. Harlequin declared Presence in the Justiciar and
Chancellor Elections.

That should read "Archivist and Chancellor" of course.

Or, vote for the soon-to-be distributed "Risky Rebellion" proposal, 
which still allows the possibility of Rebellions lead by a minority of
players, but makes them less reliable, and thus unlikely to happen 
quite as often.

Hmm, I take that back.  I think perhaps the it's more natural to
say that Feb. 28th (or 29th in a leap year) is 1 month after
Jan. 31.  Well, I don't have any strong feeling one way or the other.

You might want to check out the rules defining the Shogun, as they

If RR passes, then all Blots for all Rebelling players are vacated, so
the vacation in your rule is unnecessary. The rest should probably 
remain as-is, but I think you ought to have a precedence clause in there
to make sure that it takes precedence over the Rebellion rule in the
details about how to count the Miscreant.

Hm.  You have a point.  I don't have any strong feelings either.

I see no reason to believe that the Implicit Delayed Transfers
pursuant to Voting which Rule 1442/11 created were cancelled by its
amendment by Proposal 3693.  Thus people who Voted prior to the
adoption of Proposal 3693 on Proposals whose Voting Periods ended
after the adoption of Proposal 3693 will have to pay for those Votes
twice.  Oops!

Actually, since we're usually dealing with exact times, I
think it would be acceptable to say that one month after
08:00:00 GMT, Jan. 31, is 00:00:00 GMT, Mar. 1.  So I
guess I've flopped back to Mar. 1. :)

For the record, I would like to apologize to Michael for including him
