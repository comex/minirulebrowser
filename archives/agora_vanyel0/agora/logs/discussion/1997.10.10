No, it's that the history leads me to expect to see "(Final) Judgement:

Statement 1:  "X is Y's EiP -> X is Y's Executor"
Statement 2:  "X is Y's Executor -> X is Y's EiP"

I read R1738 as making Statement 1 but not Statement 2, whereas you
read it as making both Statements.  I think all your disagreements with
my arguments stem from this difference.  Nor am I presently convinced
whether R1738 makes Statement 2 or not - Statement 2 didn't really
crystallize in my mind till I started writing this message.

So I just said to Zefram. I'm open to being convinced that R1738 does
not make the second claim, but I'll want to see an argument to that
effect.

I can't even see the word "Nomic" there. As far as I can tell, you could
transfer VTs to Vladimir Shirinovsky if you wanted...

Thank you very much, now I can hopefully start building up a small reserve
again. 

As for the EP Proposal, I would urge everybody to consider Voting FOR it
rather than just declaring Presence, as there are several people who might
benefit from its failure and so may decide to vote AGAINST.

Harlequin,

Do you intend to resubmit your PC fixup proposal? 
I'm prepared to submit a PI amnesty proposal, but
I'd like them to be in the same batch.

Andre, please be more careful about these; hardly a CFJ annoucement or 
judgement is sent out without a missing field or two. In this case, it's 
hardly unimportant. Thanks very much,

Parenthetically, it is not necessary to make claims of error regarding
one's own posts; one may merely correct them.  (This used to be
necessary only with respect to Currency Reports, but that requirement
was repealed.)

I guess I'll vote FOR. If I have a reasonable amount of VTs by the

You have 10 at the moment.  Is that a "reasonable amount"?

Ouch! Complete Judicial Rubbish Again. Just to make sure, here
it is without all that stuff (although only to n-d).

======================================================================

                               CFJ 1047

    "General Chaos committed the Crime of Wrongful COE denial."

======================================================================

Judge:       Michael
Justices:    Steve (S), Andre (C), elJefe (J)

Judgement:   TRUE
Final Judgement:

Eligible:    Andre, Blob, Calabresi, ChrisM, Chuck, Crito, Elde, 
	     elJefe, General Chaos, Harlequin, Kolja A., Michael, 
             Murphy, Oerjan, Steve, Vir, Vlad, Zefram

Not eligible:
Caller:      Morendil
Barred:
On request:  Vanyel
On hold:     Swann

Injunction (deferred):

By R1504/5 I am required to enjoin the Clerk of the Courts to execute
whatever Payment Orders are necessary to penalise General Chaos for
the Crime he has committed.  (R1431 states that Wrongful COE denial is
a Class 1 Crime, and R1505 states that such crimes bear a 1 Blot
penalty.)

======================================================================

History:
  Called by Morendil, 27 Sep 1997 03:15:17 +0100
  Assigned to Michael, 1 Oct 1997 19:37:18 +0200 (MET DST)
  Judged TRUE by Michael, 7 Oct 1997 09:49:54 +0100
  Appealed by General Chaos, 09 Oct 1997 00:12:01 -0500
  Appealed by Steve, 10 Oct 1997 11:48:11 +1000 (EST)
  Assigned to Steve, Andre and elJefe as Justices, as of that message

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

You would prefer that I ignore the obvious and direct meaning as
being a Transfer Order for 4 VTs in favor of the less obvious,
indirect meaning as being 2 Transfer Orders for 2 VTs each? 
Please. COE denied.  Further, I transfer one Kudo from Morendil for
making such a baseless COE, to Harlequin, for being the unfortunate
victim of circumstance. 

For one thing, that is precisely what I expect you to do - the Courts
have been working overtime to establish that implicit specifications
in the wording of Orders were to be given due consideration, and
Harlequin's request for a transfer is worded so that it was well
within your authority, given this judicial basis, to interpret it as
two successful distinct TOs. Note that Harlequin's request did not
purport to be one TO for 4 VTs, but merely requested that you note a
Transfer or Transfers for a total of 4 VTs; given that the POs this
aimed to satisfy were explicitly listed, your contention that the
'obvious and direct' intent was as a TO for an amount of 4 VTs
simply makes no sense.

For another thing, "unfortunate victim of circumstance", together
with your statement that "The Bank gratefully appreciates your
donation", strikes me as very cynical.

I'll let the Agoran community take appropriate steps, if they so
wish, to compensate for the injurious Kudo transfer above; however,
your behaviour as an Officer should be subject to formal scrutiny
and I therefore submit the following CFJ :

===
General Chaos committed the Crime of Wrongful COE denial.
===

======================================================================

Reasons and arguments Judge:

This Judge finds that, in stating that Harlequin's message "I transfer
4 VTs to the Bank, to satisfy VT POs 1040 and 1041" failed to satisfy
payment orders VT1040 and VT1041, and then denying a COE asserting the
opposite, General Chaos committed the Crime of Wrongful COE denial.

As the caller of the CFJ claims, it is legitimate to interpret
statements such as Harlequin's generously, to wit that the transfer
made be considered two separate Transfer Orders, one for each of the
two Payment Orders he was required to satisfy. 

This is in line with recent judicial (and appelate) decisions which
allow Transfer and Payment Orders to be made implicitly, and
represents a welcome shift towards a less pedantic style of play.

Michael.
