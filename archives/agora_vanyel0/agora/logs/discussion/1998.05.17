I should that 6 messages, all from Crito, were diverted; I've bounced them
all to the lists. Let's see if mungedomain helps Crito.

One of the explicit features of our pragmatised Currency system is that
you, as the Recordkeepor, are the arbiter of whether Transfers succeed, as
long as you make a good faith effort.

You should of course still make corrections for the fact that Currency
holdings were not what you thought they were, but you need not disallow
any Transfers you previously accepted just because holdings go negative.

An interesting question is whether you are even allowed to disallow
Transfers after the fact.  I don't think so.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

Ørjan, are you just trying to test out my character set? If so, I can
report that it passed with flying colours: I got all the accents and
diphthongs, and not an escape character to be seen. I can even spell
your name correctly now!

What it does it mean, by the way? It sounds like a nursery rhyme...
that is, inasmuch as I have any idea what it sounds like, since I
don't know much about how to pronounce Norwegian.

Come now, that's a bit harsh, don't you think? I have RTFM on majordomo
several times, but yesterday I was in a hurry. I do wish I was a majordomo
wizard, but we all have our limitations...

Did the messages get mangled? They looked OK to me...

That was just to show Ørjan that I do know how to approve bounced
messages. I just didn't have time to remind myself yesterday afternoon.

I'll unsubscribe Jon from the lists.
