You have it wrong. I claim that the Board had a mandate to consider
the legality on one hand, and the appropriateness on the other hand,
of the Injunctions. I further claim that the Board has not returned a
decision on their legality; and I further claim that the Board
reached a decision on their appropriateness without due consideration
of what criteria of appropriateness are implied by Rule 663 - but
then, that is not to be blamed on the Board. On the other hand, it
is plain that a Court decision on these criteria would be helpful to
future Boards of Appeal considering an Injunction.

> Tell me, will the Judge have any greater mandate to inquire into
> the legality of our actions than we did to enquire into yours? 

The Judge (and possibly, the Justices) asked to consider Rule 663's
implications on the issue of the appropriateness of Injunctions will
as a consequence have to consider the legality of the decision
reached by the Board of Appeal, on the grounds that Judgements must
accord with the Rules; if it is decided that Rule 663 does not
require that an Injunction's appropriateness be determined by the
criterion that the Injunction provide a remedy for the situation
specifically adressed by the statement of the CFJ, and further
determines that the Injunctions issued in 1045 were appropriate
under that interpretation of Rule 663, then the decision of the
Board was indeed illegal.

Why ? Obviously I, as Judge, had already reached my own decision as
to what constituted an appropriate Injunction. If I hadn't thought
the Injunctions were somehow appropriate to the situation, I wouldn't
have issued them, would I ? It seems to me that the Board of Appeals
presented no compelling argument that their interpretation of
'appropriate' was in any way better than mine.

You did not give such a reason. I cannot see that "I feel like it" 
includes any of the reasons listed in Rule 1565.

> >I also Transfer a Kudo from Chuck for ignoring the Rules for Dismissal,
> 
> What Rule do you allege I ignored?

Rule 1565, which requires you to dismiss for a legal reason, and to notify
the CotC of the reasons.

My Appeal is of course based on you not doing the former. If you had
better reasons, but chose not to give them, then you still violated Rule
1565 by not giving your reasons.

By the way, I cannot see that I have received any Ruleset since September
20.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

No Rule requires that the reasons I give be among the legal reasons.
It is sufficient that I have legal reasons for doing so.

I did dismiss for a legal reason.  I also notified the COTC of

So if a Judge has only one legal reason to dismiss it, it is impossible
for em to satisfy this provision?

I read "the reasons" as meaning more than just "a reason".

The natural way to interpret it is "the legal reasons, as above".

The only alternative I see is to interpret it as "all reasons", something
which is going to be a monumental document.

So, with this becoming more and more of a dispute every minute, will
someone else join my Appeal, or should I make a separate CFJ on the
interpretation of Rule 1565?

Greetings,
Ørjan.

I agree, except for with the final statement. I see nothing in 1738 that
would make Blob eir own EiP. I agree that an EiP must be an executor and,
therefore, must be a Player, but since then Blob's EiP is no longer a
player and therefore no longer an EiP, Blob *has* no EiP and it is
Murphy's job to give em an new one.

Since the point is to use common sense when there is ambiguity: no.

Chuck, can you clarify whether you sent any additional reasons to the 
CotC, or was the message to the PF the only communication to the CotC? If 
it was, barring additional convincing, I'm tending to agree with Oerjan 
that you are required to state at least 1 *legal* reason to dismiss..

Chris

And, I think, that all Wills ceased to exist. That seems to be pretty 
much all of it, though. Not exactly earth-shaking.

Existing Wills ceased to be legally authorized SLCs (R1590) when
they ceased to have a Maintainer (formerly the Notary). A Will that
is not "legally authorized" is IMHO no longer a Nomic Entity in the
sense of Rule 1586, that is, it ceases to exist.

You presented no argument at all that your Injunctions were appropriate;
you merely presented the Injunctions, along with some arguments for
their legality. All three of the Justices presented similar arguments
that the Injunctions were inappropriate.

No, I guess not. My apologies.

It does have the interesting effect that deregistering Players will
not get assigned Executors in Probate, as there is now no-one to do 
the assigning.

We've just *had* a Court decision on what criteria of appropriateness
should be considered when considering the appropriateness of an
Injunction with respect to R1695. Why do you now want another?

As for Rule 663, it was the Board's view that this Rule has minimal
if any implications at all for the appropriateness of Injunctions,
only their legality. R1695 makes a clear distinction between an
Injunction's being made legally, according to the Rules in a
technical sense (ie in accordance with procedures), and its being
appropriate to the situation, which is not a matter of procedure.
R663 speaks only to procedural matters and is therefore irrelevant to
matters of appropriateness.   

You are, of course, free to make further CFJs clarifying these
points, which in my view are already sufficiently clear from
what the Board has already said.

'Illegal' is a strong word. Even if there were grounds for believing
that R663 is especially relevant to the appropriateness of
Injunctions and not just their legality, (which I doubt, see my
argument above), it still seems to me that the Board would have been
well within its rights to determine that your Injunctions were
inappropriate for the reasons given. And if I had to bet which way
a Judge would view the matter, I know where I'd put my money.

What about the Statement "The Executor in Probate of an entity is the
Executor of that entity"?

A includes B !-> B includes A. 

Look at it chronologically: Elde is Blob's EiP before e's deregistered.
When e is deregistered, e stops being EiP, since an EiP must be an
Executor, and an Executor must be a Player, and Elde no longer is a
Player. At that point, no Rule specifies another Executor for Blob, so
Blob once again becomes eir own Executor. However, R1738 does *not*
say that the Executor of an entity is the EiP of that entity, so no
Rule names an EiP for Blob. Thus, since e is still in Probate, and
e has no EiP, the Notary is required to name one for em. Of course, 
that leads to our next problem...

I just realized, after sending my other mail, that there's another way
of interpreting this, i.e. "Whichever player is the Executor of an
entity is also the EiP of that entity." In that case, however, EiPs
are not a subset of Executors but a seperate thing. Also, that means
that every player is currently their own EiP.

Indeed.  Which means that any Currencies (and Payment Orders) they
depart the game with will remain with them, indefinitely.  Talk about
taking it to the grave with you....
