Was this intended to be an admission of anything more than an indirect,
for-the-purposes-of-Agora legal truth?  (I recall a CFJ being Judged TRUE
that said something like "Upon eir registration, General Chaos had <some
number less than 20 Kudos".)

A Declaration of Absence would be like a Declaration of Presence, except it
wouldn't count toward Quorum; but it *would* count as a Rule-recognized
response to the Proposal ("I choose not to count toward Quorum on this
Proposal").  The Assessor could publish a list of all Players who had either
Voted, declared Presence, or declared Absence on a given Proposal; any
Players not on that list would then have truly done nothing in response
to it.

Same flaw as Swann's recent "Repeals Without Objection" Proposal:  Someone
can bury "I hereby announce my intent to repeal Rule 4000, Without Objection"
in the middle of a long message to the PF.  (Then again, that Win for myself
that I buried in the first version of "Name That <Crime/Infraction>" was
discovered rather quickly...)

I believe Kosko suggests the following:

Let t(x) be the truth value of x.
Let t(y) be the truth value of y.
Then t(!x) = 1 - t(x)
     t(x and y) = t(x) * t(y)
     t(x or y) = t(!(!x and !y)) and the math proceeds accordingly
and presumably the validity of an argument follows from that.  Comments?

Didn't I comment on the first version of this pointing out that it
suffered from the flaw of making someone who had just resigned from
the game continue to hold the Office if their appointee didn't consent
to the appointment?  At least the current scheme ensures that we have
Players in Offices.

I am willing to believe that a case might be made to claim that as the
leaving person is still holding the office when they deregister, they
are effectively removing themselves from Office a la R1555, thus
dumping the job on the Speaker. 

But even if we grant this, things still makes for a messy rule:

i. Officer A states that they are resigning from their Office,
appointing B to succeed them.

ii. B hasn't yet consented to the appointment. 

iii. A deregisters, and as A is still in Office, A is removed from
Office and the Speaker becomes the new holder of the Office. 

iv. B now announces in the PF that they consent to the appointment
after all.  R880 takes precedence over R1555, so now B gets installed
in the Office. 

I don't think this proposal is an improvement on the current
situation. 

As things stand, people can get appointed to Offices without their
consent, but they can decline the appointment as soon as they like and
the Speaker gets the job.  I think the cleanest way of writing this
rule would be to insist on consent before resignation and appointment.
Then the whole situation becomes a lot clearer.

For the moment, I recommend that people vote against Steve's proposal,
as it is a flawed attempt to fix a situation that really isn't as bad
as he makes out, and for which there is definitely a better fix. 

Michael.

No.  Being 5 hours behind UTC (as indicated by the header) makes it 13:17:34Z.

You have it backwards.  EST is five hours behind GMT, so 8:17 EST is
13:17 GMT.

Oops.  I am so used to this format, I didn't even notice that.  I hope context
from previous messages is sufficient for this, I too would like to consider it
a typo and let it stand.  Especially since I can infer the proper meaning of
the message from the results of the voting.  Of course, it's not up to me to
admit or deny this particular claim.

Well, the difference is that most Players read through most Proposals
regularly, but rarely read through the Logical Ruleset or the Voting Token
Report.  Although with the exception of the Ruleset (and André's folders)
most messages are short enough that I at least browse them.

Greetings,

I concur with this determination.  You might want to check to see if
Morendil was improperly assigned to any Boards of Appeal in the past
two days.

I believe this also makes Crito, once again, temporary Speaker-Elect,
although I think Michael is obliged to formally annouce that.

Also, Morendil is no longer a Player.

Nope.  The last Board of Appeal (CFJ 1062) was assigned on Tuesday night,
when Morendil was still Speaker.

1.) But I believe he may now re-register.
2.) He still remains a Justice in Appeal CFJ 1062, though...
3.) Didn't his Executor in Probate attempt to register him?

Yes, I do.  Apparently I have to be explicit.  Sigh.  Hard to be

The trouble is that these functions violate our intuitions about how the
connectives are supposed to work in some cases. Consider for example
t(x and !x), which surely ought to be 0, but which will be positively
valued unless x = 0 or x = 1; or t(x or !x), which ought to be 1, but
again won't be unless x = 0 or x = 1. Williamson has many other examples,
and in fact does an excellent job of arguing that fuzzy logic is not
an improvement on classical logic in respecting other important
logical intuitions besides those invoked by Sorites paradoxes.

I don't believe I saw any such comment. I need to think about your

It's a shame we just missed out on that paradox. If either Kolja or
myself had agreed with Morendil, then Morendil's Judgement would
have been a legal Speaker's Judgement if and only if it was not.

I wish I'd had a chance to read Morendil's Judgement before making
my own. He raised some points I hadn't considered.

I note that the Justices are expected to consider the question before
them "collectively", which suggests that they should confer amongst
themselves before issuing any opinions.  Sadly, this does not appear
to be the common practice.

That is the current interpretation of R1555, and it will not
change if my Proposal is adopted. So your first objection is met.

I disagree. I tend to think that the situation you describe is as
much a feature as it is a bug. What we have is a trade off: on the
downside, the Office may change hands twice (A -> Speaker -> B),
but on the upside, we avoid dumping the Office on the Speaker for
at least two weeks in the case where there is a willing successor.

That is true: your Proposal is a lot cleaner than mine, because it
doesn't preserve the ability of Officers to name successors who
haven't consented yet - a feature I wanted to keep. Since both
Proposals are to be distributed together, the next distribution
effectively becomes a referendum on the question of whether we want
to retain this feature of the current system or not, since I take
it that your other objections are met. Your Proposal has a slight
advantage: being submitted later, it will receive a higher number,
and thus if both pass, your Proposal will cancel the effects of mine.

I deny that my attempt is flawed. It merely represents a different
set of assumptions about what features are desirable. If you want to
retain the ability of Officers name successors who haven't yet consented,
I recommend you vote for my Proposal. If you want to give this feature
up, vote for Michael's Proposal.

I usually try to do that. In this case, however, I'm afraid that I
had forgotten that I had been assigned as a Justice in this Appeal
until I received CotC Jeff's reminder a few hours before the deadline.

That is premature. CFJ 1070, currently before the Courts, may determine
that Morendil was registered as a Player immediately upon becoming
Speaker. If so, he remains registered as a Player at present.

I actually think the argument for the a Judgement of TRUE in CFJ
1070 is pretty strong. Morendil did become Speaker; R103 states
that 'Player' specifically refers to the Speaker; R869 says that
a Player is a person registered as a Player.

I think that that interpretation is abusive of the language of Rule
869.  Clearly (to me) Rule 869 does not make "Player" and "person
registered as a Player" logically equivalent.  Rather, Rule 869
provides a decision rule for identifying Players.  To hold that Rule
869 magically "registered" Morendil as a Player when Rule 103 made him
one is contorted, in my opinion.
