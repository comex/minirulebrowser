I wonder if this Rule wouldn't be a good candidate for upmutation...
Although I think there should be an exception for explicit amnesties.

That is exactly the point which I think has been wrongly legislated - it
should be "explicit", not "clear".  I feel that any message which is
required to go to the Public Forum to have effect, does contain a clear
indication of being intended to be a message to the Public Forum, even if 
accidentally sent to agora-discussion.

I've got a Proposal to amend this Rule on the back burner; I could
easily make this suggested change and bring it back forward again.

Here it is again.  BTW, I would be willing to "mark up" protos for
people; for the moment I will do so without fee in the interest of
furthering a standard.  I also have a Perl script that does the
formatting automatically; contact me if interested.

======================================================================

For text not set out with an indexed subdivision, indent six spaces on
the left margin.  Otherwise the indent is ten spaces plus two spaces
for each sublevel.  The indexing tag hangs into the margin.  Right
margin is always at column 70.

All indexing tags are enclosed in parenthesis.  Do not put two tags on
the same line; if you want a division with no non-subdivided text,
leave the line after the tag blank.

The first level of tags is lowercase letters; use "aa", "bb", etc
after "z".  The second level is digits.  The third level is uppercase
letters.  Fourth and subsequent levels repeat this pattern: hence,
(a)(1)(A)(a)(1).  (I hope that we never need more than three levels.)
I don't use roman numerals because they take up a lot of space.

Blank lines between paragraphs only for first-level and unindexed
paragraphs.  (This is more open to reasonable variation.)

Protoproposal Chaos68 [rev. 2]

Keep Conway Out Of The Clock

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1527 be amended to read:

      Whenever a message contains more than one notification, report,
      or other communication in which the Rules place some legal
      significance, and the relative order of those communications is
      legally relevant, those communications shall be considered to
      have been sent in the order in which they appear in that
      message.  All such communications are considered to have been

Plainness is a Virtue

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1023 be amended to read:

      (a) Any Player who fails to perform an action required of em by
          the Rules in a timely manner is guilty of Tardiness, a Class
          D Crime.

      (b) The definition of "a timely manner" shall be at the sound
          discretion of the Judge assigned to judge a CFJ alleging
          this crime, but shall in no case include:
        (1) intentional failures to perform;
        (2) intentional delays in performance; or
        (3) intentional performances of actions in an order other than
            that in which they were incurred, when the effect of
            performance in the proper order would have been
            substantially different.

Protoproposal Chaos44 [rev. 5]

Oh, what a tangled web....

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 478 be amended to read:

      (a) A Public Forum is any medium of communication so designated
          as such by the Registrar.

      (b) The Registrar may designate any medium as a Public Forum, or
          revoke such designation from a medium already so designated,
|         Without Objection.  However, the message which is to
          effectuate the change intended must be sent via a medium
          which is a Public Forum both before and after the
          designation or revocation, in order to have legal effect.

      (c) Every Active Player shall ensure that e is able to receive
          messages sent to every medium which the Registrar has
          designated as a Public Forum.  However, the temporary
          inability of a Player to receive a Public Forum does not
          deprive that medium of its status as a Public Forum.

      (d) Any message conveyed by one or more Public Fora is deemed to
          have been sent to the Public Forum.

      (e) Subdivision (d) of this Rule notwithstanding, any message
          sent, by any medium or combination of media, to every Active
          Player so that each Active Player is reasonably certain to
          receive it, is deemed to have been sent to the Public Forum,
|         but only if it bears an explicit indication that it is
|         intended to be a Public Forum message.

      (f) Whenever the Rules require a Player to "announce", "post",
          or "distribute" some communication or notification, that
          Player shall do so by sending it to the Public Forum, unless
          the Rules specify otherwise in that instance.

I think that if we are to have a major revision of the "As soon as
possible" system, it would be better to separate completely the
requirements of timeliness and order, and make the latter explicit for
the actions that reasonably require it (such as Proposal results and
Currency transfers.)

Also, I think (2) is too strict - it should be legal to delay when it is
not done excessively.  At least one week should be legal when not
explicitly stricter.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

I suggest removing the precedence clause and changing "but only if" to "as
long as", as otherwise this would appear partly to nullify (d) rather than
complement it.

I invite commentary on the legal status of the Proposals made in the
message referred to by Ørjan.  It's possible that they have been
legally Proposed by myself, and if so I should insert them in the
queue.  (Of course, if so I could subsequently remove them, so the
matter is readily mootable, but I would prefer to play by the book, as
it were.)

I also invite commentary on whether a COE is proper with respect to
that message.

Protoproposal Chaos44 [rev. 6]

Oh, what a tangled web....

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 478 be amended to read:

      (a) A Public Forum is any medium of communication so designated
          as such by the Registrar.

      (b) The Registrar may designate any medium as a Public Forum, or
          revoke such designation from a medium already so designated,
          Without Objection.  However, the message which is to
          effectuate the change intended must be sent via a medium
          which is a Public Forum both before and after the
          designation or revocation, in order to have legal effect.

      (c) Every Active Player shall ensure that e is able to receive
          messages sent to every medium which the Registrar has
          designated as a Public Forum.  However, the temporary
          inability of a Player to receive a Public Forum does not
          deprive that medium of its status as a Public Forum.

      (d) Any message conveyed by one or more Public Fora is deemed to
|         have been sent to the Public Forum.  In addition, any
|         message sent, by any medium or combination of media, to
|         every Active Player so that each Active Player is reasonably
|         certain to receive it, is deemed to have been sent to the
|         Public Forum, but only if it bears an explicit indication
|         that it is intended to be a Public Forum message.

|     (e) Whenever the Rules require a Player to "announce", "post",
          or "distribute" some communication or notification, that
          Player shall do so by sending it to the Public Forum, unless
          the Rules specify otherwise in that instance.

Well, the question here seems to be what is the status of actions that
purport to be on behalf of an entity of which one is the Executor, when in
fact one is not the Executor of that entity.  I don't think it really
matters whether this is due to the entity not existing or due to one not
being its Executor.

I seem to recall this recently happening with someone else, but not who or
what was involved, or what the consensus was.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

Protoproposal Chaos75 [rev. 2]

Plainness is a Virtue

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1023 be amended to read:

|     (a) Any Player who fails to perform, in a timely manner, an
|         action required of em by the Rules is guilty of Tardiness, a
|         Class D Crime.

      (b) The definition of "a timely manner" shall be at the sound
          discretion of the Judge assigned to judge a CFJ alleging
          this crime, but shall in no case include:
|       (1) intentional failures to perform; nor
|       (2) intentional or excessive delays in performance.
| 
|     (c) Generally, performance within one week's time will be timely
|         unless the Rules suggest otherwise.  The performance of
|         actions in an order other than that in which the duties to
|         perform them were incurred may be used as evidence of
|         untimely performance, but is not proof thereof.
| 
|     (d) This Rule in no way modifies any requirement imposed by
|         other Rules to perform specific acts within a specific time
|         or in a specific order.

Well, the question here seems to be what is the status of actions that

fact one is not the Executor of that entity.  I don't think it really
matters whether this is due to the entity not existing or due to one not
being its Executor.
<<

But there is a big difference between different actions, too. For
example, making currency transfers FROM an entity of which one is not
an executor remains without effect if the recordkeepor is doing eir
job well (R1817). OTOH, it seems to me the proposals in Scott's
message are perfectly valid proposals in the sense of 1483: they were
delivered to the PF by a proposing entity (Scott) with the clear
indication that they were intended to be proposals. I think the only
reason why the Promotor had to state "I submit... as executor of the
R-O-M" was to make sure that the submission actually fulfilled eir
obligation as Promotor to do the ROM stuff. But it wasn't needed to
make the submission a valid one.

It is possible, however, that the Crime of Impersonation was comitted
here - do let's discuss whether Scott made this mistake 'knowingly'
(R1630) ;) - although a conviction would be quite costly...

I had forgotten that the Repeal-O-Matic was up for repeal; I certainly
had not realized that it had been repealed.  (In the sense of the
Model Penal Code, I was negligent, perhaps reckless, to my lack of
authority; knowledge is a much higher standard.)

Also, I'm not clear that Rule 1630 applies, as I was attempting to act
as the Executor of an apparently non-existent entity.  Surely, the
entity of which the accused is attempting to act as Executor must
exist to meet the requirements of this Rule, no?

I believe it was when a prior Promotor incorrectly made several
Repeal-O-Matic Proposals.  The fractured consensus was that the acts
had no legal force, but I think in that case because the
Repeal-O-Matic at that time made its Proposals through legal fiction,

Steve, I believe, was due to become Required to Serve this week, but
submitted a Proposal on the 22nd, thereby pushing himself to the
bottom of the list, and pushing yourself up by one.

Protoproposal Chaos76 [rev. 1]

Consistency is a Hobgoblin, I

The purpose of this Proposal is to regularize the use of indexing
annotations in the Rules.  At present, the Rules are a sloppy mess in
this regard, using all sorts of schemes.

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1841 be amended to read:

      (a) Any Player who has been continuously registered for two or
          more months is empowered to give another willing Player eir
          Power of Attorney for a specified period of time.  The
          giving Player shall be known, for this Rule, as the Grantor.
          The receiving Player shall be known, for this Rule, as the
          Holder.

      (b) Power of Attorney is given by the Grantor posting in the
          Public Forum, naming the Holder e is giving the Power of
          Attorney to, and the time period for which the Power of
          Attorney shall given. To be effective, this post must name a
          time that begins within the week following the posting. The
          Power of Attorney shall not be granted unless the Holder is
          an active Player and consents in the Public Forum before the
          beginning of the specified period of time.

      (c) If the grant is effective, the Holder shall then have the
          Power of Attorney beginning at the specified time.  This
          grant shall end when one of the following occurs:
        (1) the period specified expires;
        (2) the Grantor posts in the Public Forum that e is
            withdrawing eir Power of Attorney;
        (3) the Grantor is deregistered, or goes On Hold;
        (4) the Holder is deregistered, or goes On Hold; or
        (5) it has been over three months since the Grantor gave eir
            Power of Attorney to the Holder.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1431 be amended to read:

      (a) A Claim of Error is a message posted to the Public Forum to
          the effect that a specific post to the Public Forum
          misrepresents the actual Game State, and documenting the
          nature of the error.

      (b) A Response to a Claim of Error consists in posting to the
          Public Forum either a denial of the Claim or an admission of
          the Claim. If the Claim is admitted, then the Player making
          the admission is required to post a corrected version of the
          relevant portion of the message which was in error, before
          one week passes from the time the Claim of Error was made. A
          Player who admits a Claim but does not publish a correction
          is deemed not to have Responded to that Claim.

      (c) A Response must be provided by the Player who is required by
          the Rules to publish the information subject to a Claim
          within one week of the Claim being made, unless any of the
          following holds:
        (1) a previous Claim was made concerning the same error;
        (2) the relevant message has been posted more than 21 days
            before; or
        (3) another message by the same Player has corrected the
            error.

      (d) A Player who fails to post a Response within the alloted
          time commits the Infraction of Delayed COE Response,
          carrying a penalty of 1 Blot, to be reported by the Player
          who posted the Claim. A Player who incorrectly issues a
          denial of a Claim commits the Crime of Wrongful COE Denial,
          a Class 1 Crime, unless e then admits the Claim within 72
          hours after the incorrect denial.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1791 be amended to read:

      (a) Any Officer who holds an Office in Normal Fashion can Ratify
          an Official Report Without Objection, provided the following
          conditions hold:
        (1) the Report to be Ratified is one that is legally
            permissible to Ratify;
        (2) the Report to be Ratified was produced by the Player
            holding the Office; and
        (3) the Report to be Ratified is one that is required to be
            produced and maintained by the Officer.

      (b) A Speaker who is not Tainted is permitted to Ratify any
          Official Report Without Objection provided that the Report
          is one legally permissible to Ratify.

      (c) A COE on any Report undergoing this process shall be deemed
          by the Rules to constitute an Objection.

Also, I'm not clear that Rule 1630 applies, as I was attempting to act
as the Executor of an apparently non-existent entity.  Surely, the
entity of which the accused is attempting to act as Executor must
exist to meet the requirements of this Rule, no?
<<

But the wording of R1630 doesn't meniotn whether the entity exists: 

>>
      Any Player who knowingly attempts to act as, or purports to be,
      the Executor of an Entity, of which e is not the Executor,
      commits the Crime of Impersonation, a Class C Crime.
<<

You attempted to act as executor of the ROM, but you weren't. Note
that the rule explicitly includes failed attempts, because it says
"attempts to act as", not "acts as". Or are you saying that the ROM is
not an entity at all now, because the rule defining it has been
repealed? It may not be a Nomic Entity (do we still have that concept
in the rules?), but why isn't it an entity? "The entity formerly
defined in the ruleset as Prince^H^H^H^H^H R-O-M", or something.

If you were one of the players with many indulgences, I'd call a CFJ
on this, just to reduce the number of indulgences in circulation (they
have to go somewhere, don't they), but you're not, so I'm not sure
what to do next. Oh well.

      (c) A COE on any Report undergoing this process shall be deemed
          by the Rules to constitute an Objection.
| 
| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1552 be amended to read:
| 
|     (a) In order for an Official Document to be valid for the
|         purpose of a Ratification, it must satisfy all the following
|         criteria at the time the Proposal which would Ratify it is
|         Proposed:
|       (1) The Rules require some specific Player to produce and/or
|           maintain the document.
|       (2) The Rules required it to be published in the Public Forum.
|           (A requirement that it be sent to all Players fulfills
|           this criterion.)
|       (3) It is not currently subject to a Claim of Error. (COE)
|       (4) It is not currently subject to a pending Call for
|           Judgement (CFJ), or a pending Appeal of a CFJ.
|       (5) The information within the Document has not been
|           superseded by a subsequent Document.
|       (6) The Document is not the Ruleset. The Ruleset is
|           specifically excluded from Ratification.
| 
|     (b) Further, a Document can become invalid during the Voting
|         Period of a Proposal which would Ratify it if any of the
|         following occurs:
|       (1) The Document is superseded by a subsequent Document which
|           contradicts the information in the prior Document. This
|           does not apply if there is a COE alleging the
|           contradiction is an error, and the error is admitted
|           before the end of the Proposal's Voting Period.
|       (2) A COE is made on the Document, and the COE has not been
|           denied before the end of the Proposal's Voting Period.
|       (3) The Document becomes subject to a pending CFJ or a pending
|           appeal of a CFJ.
| 
|     (c) If, during the Voting Period of a Proposal to Ratify a
|         Document, another Document is issued that does not
|         contradict the prior Document, it does not alter the
|         validity of the prior Document.

>> Rule 1715 states
 
       A Player may declare that e is PRESENT on a Proposal, Election
       or Referendum, by sending a message to that effect to the Vote
       Collector of this Proposal, Election or Referendum.

The Point is the vote collector recieved the mail (if not let me know) 
By his recieving this mail it means that I have sent it to him, thus 
satifying rule 1715.  So my declaration of presence is valid, regardless 
of the means in which the vote collector gets this message.  As long as 
he gets the message I want him to get the, message has been sent by me 
to him.

I was also a member of Nomic World.  As for being the "eternal Rulekeepor"
it should probably be noted that Wes was Rulekeepor when the position
was created and for several months after that.  I took it over when
Wes left.

You could also arguee that he would have to he know that he wasn't the 
entity's exicutor (which he did not in this case).  If not the following 
arguement holds (I think). 

One could accuse anybody of impersonating some nonexitant entity's 
exicutor.  By saying that the exicutor of that entity (if it were to 
exist) would be acting as the exicutor if e where to, say, post to a 
public forum using a certain phrase..... or some other menial task that 
the nonexistant exicutor would exicute.... apparantly this would be in 
the definition of the nonexistant entity.  By doing this he has 
(unknowingly to himself) acted as an exictor of a entity of which he is 
not the exicutor..... and so commits the Crime of Impersonation.

This is rather silly, so I really do not think he is guilty.  Unless he 
DID know that the ROM had been repealed, and thus that he was not it's 
exicutor.

Any idea when I joined the game, Vlad?  I don't see it mentioned in
your chronology.  It couldn't have been before Aug. 20 1993, as that's
the date I moved to Madison, and I first joined the game from my wisc.edu
account.  Your first mention of me in the chronology is my judging
CFJ 35 on Sep. 17 1993, but I suspect I joined somewhat before then.

I think (2) is overly broad unless a minimum time limit before that
standard may be imposed is stated.  Otherwise, if I deliberately choose
to do something 3 days after the duty to do so is incurred, when it
was within my power to do it 1 day after the duty was incurred, then
I am guilty of not performing the duty in a timely manner.

My posting prompted the digging out of info by a number of players,
among them Michael, who has saved the proposal logs for the early
proposals through 594. I will be digesting them for public consumption.
Unfortunately, the proposal numbers have been cut off due to 
translation difficulties (which I am trying to work out), so I
am not sure exactly which proposal you first voted on. However,
the voting period on that proposal ended Sept. 17, by chance, so you
probably didn't register too long before then, unless you didn't
vote.

Not likely.  I guess it took me longer than I thought to get my email
account and register once I had moved to Wisconsin.  Based on that,
I'd request that the Registrar update my approximate registration
date to ~1993-09.

Thanks for the info.

I direct your attention to Rule 1764:

Rule 1764/4 (Power=1)
Public Voting

      Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
      any votes, or the declaration of Presence, by Voting Entities
      on Proposals, Elections or Referenda, may only be achieved by
      sending a message to the Public Forum.

      However, this Rule shall have no effect on the voting for a
      Proposal if it would prevent all legal voting on that Proposal.

I hereby return a Judgement of TRUE.

In my opinion, Morendil's quoting of the message by which he attempted to
submit the Proposal does not constitute a Proposal.  The text was clearly
quoted for purposes of making clear what message he was referring to as
having not made it to the PF.  Thus it fails to meet the requirements of
R1483 as there was no "clear indication that that text is intended to become
a Proposal."

Protoproposal Chaos74 [rev. 2]

Broaden Actions Without Objection

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1728 be amended to read:

      (a) When the Rules specify that an action may be performed
          "Without N Objections", where N is an integer between one
          and five inclusive, that action may be legally performed
          under the following conditions:
        (1) The Player who seeks to perform the action has announced
            eir intent to perform that action not fewer than four days
|           before, nor more than fourteen days before, the
|           performance of the action, and this announcement must
|           unambiguously describe the action to be performed;
        (2) The action performed must match exactly the action
            described in the announcement made under subdivision
            (a)(1) of this Rule;
        (3) The Rule which authorizes the performance of that action
            Without N Objections must explicitly state which Player or
            Players are authorized to perform that action; and
        (4) During the time between the announcement made under
            subdivision (a)(1) of this Rule and the performance of the
            action itself, fewer than N Players have posted, in the
            Public Forum, Objections to the performance of that
            action.

      (b) If the action to be performed is the change of some property
          under that Player's control, the change may not take place
          until the Player announces that e is making that change. 
          (This requirement is met by making any announcement normally
          required by the Rules in order to make such changes.)

      (c) The specification in the Rules that an action may be
          performed "Without Objection" is equivalent to specifying
          that it may be performed "Without 1 Objection".

      (d) The specification in the Rules that an action may be
          performed "Without N Objections" in no way prohibits
          performing that same action if doing so would be otherwise
          permissible.

      (e) A Rule may specify further restrictions upon the performance
          of an action Without N Objections, and this Rule defers to
          such Rules.

Excellent. It's clear, concise, and open to "common sense" interpretation.
Bravo.

Protoproposal Chaos75 [rev. 3]

Plainness is a Virtue

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1023 be amended to read:

      (a) Any Player who fails to perform, in a timely manner, an
          action required of em by the Rules is guilty of Tardiness, a
          Class D Crime.

      (b) The definition of "a timely manner" shall be at the sound
          discretion of the Judge assigned to judge a CFJ alleging
          this crime, but shall in no case include:
        (1) intentional failures to perform; nor
|       (2) intentional, unnecessary delays in performance.

      (c) Generally, performance within one week's time will be timely
          unless the Rules suggest otherwise.  The performance of
          actions in an order other than that in which the duties to
          perform them were incurred may be used as evidence of
          untimely performance, but is not proof thereof.

      (d) This Rule in no way modifies any requirement imposed by
          other Rules to perform specific acts within a specific time
          or in a specific order.

Protoproposal Chaos76 [rev. 3]

Consistency is a Hobgoblin, I

The purpose of this Proposal is to regularize the use of indexing
annotations in the Rules.  At present, the Rules are a sloppy mess in
this regard, using all sorts of schemes.

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1841 be amended to read:

      (a) Any Player who has been continuously registered for two or
          more months is empowered to give another willing Player eir
          Power of Attorney for a specified period of time.  The
          giving Player shall be known, for this Rule, as the Grantor.
          The receiving Player shall be known, for this Rule, as the
          Holder.

      (b) Power of Attorney is given by the Grantor posting in the
          Public Forum, naming the Holder e is giving the Power of
          Attorney to, and the time period for which the Power of
          Attorney shall given. To be effective, this post must name a
          time that begins within the week following the posting. The
          Power of Attorney shall not be granted unless the Holder is
          an active Player and consents in the Public Forum before the
          beginning of the specified period of time.

      (c) If the grant is effective, the Holder shall then have the
          Power of Attorney beginning at the specified time.  This
          grant shall end when one of the following occurs:
        (1) the period specified expires;
        (2) the Grantor posts in the Public Forum that e is
            withdrawing eir Power of Attorney;
        (3) the Grantor is deregistered, or goes On Hold;
        (4) the Holder is deregistered, or goes On Hold; or
        (5) it has been over three months since the Grantor gave eir
            Power of Attorney to the Holder.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1431 be amended to read:

      (a) A Claim of Error is a message posted to the Public Forum to
          the effect that a specific post to the Public Forum
          misrepresents the actual Game State, and documenting the
          nature of the error.

      (b) A Response to a Claim of Error consists in posting to the
          Public Forum either a denial of the Claim or an admission of
          the Claim. If the Claim is admitted, then the Player making
          the admission is required to post a corrected version of the
          relevant portion of the message which was in error, before
          one week passes from the time the Claim of Error was made. A
          Player who admits a Claim but does not publish a correction
          is deemed not to have Responded to that Claim.

      (c) A Response must be provided by the Player who is required by
          the Rules to publish the information subject to a Claim
          within one week of the Claim being made, unless any of the
          following holds:
        (1) a previous Claim was made concerning the same error;
        (2) the relevant message has been posted more than 21 days
            before; or
        (3) another message by the same Player has corrected the
            error.

      (d) A Player who fails to post a Response within the alloted
          time commits the Infraction of Delayed COE Response,
          carrying a penalty of 1 Blot, to be reported by the Player
          who posted the Claim. A Player who incorrectly issues a
          denial of a Claim commits the Crime of Wrongful COE Denial,
          a Class 1 Crime, unless e then admits the Claim within 72
          hours after the incorrect denial.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1791 be amended to read:

      (a) Any Officer who holds an Office in Normal Fashion can Ratify
          an Official Report Without Objection, provided the following
          conditions hold:
        (1) the Report to be Ratified is one that is legally
            permissible to Ratify;
        (2) the Report to be Ratified was produced by the Player
            holding the Office; and
        (3) the Report to be Ratified is one that is required to be
            produced and maintained by the Officer.

      (b) A Speaker who is not Tainted is permitted to Ratify any
          Official Report Without Objection provided that the Report
          is one legally permissible to Ratify.

      (c) A COE on any Report undergoing this process shall be deemed
          by the Rules to constitute an Objection.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1552 be amended to read:

      (a) In order for an Official Document to be valid for the
          purpose of a Ratification, it must satisfy all the following
          criteria at the time the Proposal which would Ratify it is
          Proposed:
        (1) The Rules require some specific Player to produce and/or
            maintain the document.
        (2) The Rules required it to be published in the Public Forum.
            (A requirement that it be sent to all Players fulfills
            this criterion.)
        (3) It is not currently subject to a Claim of Error. (COE)
        (4) It is not currently subject to a pending Call for
            Judgement (CFJ), or a pending Appeal of a CFJ.
        (5) The information within the Document has not been
            superseded by a subsequent Document.
        (6) The Document is not the Ruleset. The Ruleset is
            specifically excluded from Ratification.

      (b) Further, a Document can become invalid during the Voting
          Period of a Proposal which would Ratify it if any of the
          following occurs:
        (1) The Document is superseded by a subsequent Document which
            contradicts the information in the prior Document. This
            does not apply if there is a COE alleging the
            contradiction is an error, and the error is admitted
            before the end of the Proposal's Voting Period.
        (2) A COE is made on the Document, and the COE has not been
            denied before the end of the Proposal's Voting Period.
        (3) The Document becomes subject to a pending CFJ or a pending
            appeal of a CFJ.

      (c) If, during the Voting Period of a Proposal to Ratify a
          Document, another Document is issued that does not
          contradict the prior Document, it does not alter the
          validity of the prior Document.
| 
| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1645 be amended to read:
| 
|     (a) An Electee to an Office who currently holds that Office is
|         permitted to appoint another Player to perform the duties of
|         that Office, for a Period not exceeding two weeks. This is
|         called Delegation; the Player doing the appointing is herein
|         referred to as the Delegating Player and the Player so
|         appointed is herein referred to as the Delegated Player.
| 
|     (b) An Office is legally Delegated if and only if the following
|         conditions are met:
|       (1) the Delegating Player has posted to the Public Forum a
|           Notice of Delegation, naming the Office being Delegated
|           and the Delegated Player;
|       (2) the Delegated Player is permitted by the Rules to hold the
|           Office at the commencement of the Period of Delegation;
|       (3) the Delegated Player has posted, within the week
|           immediately preceding or immediately following the posting
|           of the Notice of Delegation, and to the Public Forum, a
|           Notice of Consent to Delegation for that Office;
|       (4) the Delegating Player is still the Electee to the Office,
|           and still holds the office at the commencement of the
|           Period of Delegation; and
|       (5) the Period of Delegation has commenced and not yet
|           concluded.
| 
|     (c) The Period of Delegation commences at the time the Notice of
|         Delegation is posted, or at the time the Notice of Consent
|         to Delegation is posted, or at the time (if any) specified
|         by the Delegating Player, whichever is latest. The Period of
|         Delegation concludes two weeks after the Period of
|         Delegation commences, or at the end of the Term of Service
|         for the Delegated Office, or at the time (if any) specified
|         by the Delegating Player, whichever is earliest.
| 
|     (d) During the Period of Delegation, the Delegating Player
|         ceases to hold the Delegated Office; the Delegated Player
|         holds the Office temporarily, and earns the Salary for that
|         Office as described in other Rules. At the end of the Period
|         of Delegation, the Delegated Player ceases to hold the
|         Delegated Office, and the Delegating Player resumes holding
|         the Office, if e is permitted to do so. If not, the Speaker
|         holds the Office.
| 
| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1644 be amended to read:
| 
|     (a) A Player who:
|       (1) is the Electee to an Office which e currently holds, and
|           whose duties include the weekly production of an Official
|           Report, and
|       (2) fails in 3 consecutive weeks to produce the weekly Report
|           for that Office
|         commits the Infraction of Dereliction of Duty. The penalty
|         for the commission of this Infraction is the same as that
|         for a Class B Crime, in addition to which the Player is
|         removed from the Office in the performance of whose duties e
|         has been Derelict.
| 
|     (b) The Registrar is the Officer authorized to detect and report
|         the commission of Infractions of Dereliction of Duty by
|         Officers other than the Registrar. The Clerk of the Courts
|         is the Officer authorized to detect and report the
|         commission of the Infraction of Dereliction of Duty by the
|         Registrar.
| 
| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1665 be amended to read:
| 
|     (a) The Rules can give certain Officers latitude to make certain
|         decisions and determinations based upon their judgement. 
|         When these decisions and determinations have effect on the
|         Game State, Players shall always have the ability to make
|         Claims of Error alleging that these decisions and
|         determinations were made outside the authority given to the
|         Officer.  This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which
|         otherwise defines a final arbiter for such decisions and
|         determinations.
| 
|     (b) If such a Claim is denied by the Officer, the Player making
|         the Claim is then permitted to make a Call for Judgement
|         alleging that the Officer is guilty of Abuse of
|         Responsibility, a Class C Crime.  This is the only time such
|         a CFJ is permitted.
| 
|     (c) In Judging such a CFJ, to find the Officer guilty the Judge
|         must establish that the Officer did one of the following:
|       (1) Went beyond all reasonable interpretations of the Rules.
|       (2) That e disregarded explicit instructions the Rules gave in
|           regard to eir decisions and determinations.
|       (3) That e showed a pathological lack of judgement in such
|           decisions and determinations.
| 
|     (d) The accused Officer must be given the opportunity to explain
|         eir actions.  And such Judgements shall be made in accord to
|         the strictest possible standard of proof.
| 
| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1728 be amended to read:
| 
|     (a) Certain changes to Nomic Properties may be made Without N
|         Objections, where N is an integer between one and five
|         inclusive, specifying how many objections are necessary to
|         prevent the change from taking place. Only those changes
|         explicitly allowed by other Rules may be so made, and in
|         order for such a change to take effect, the Rule allowing
|         the change must explicitly state which Player or Players are
|         authorized to make the change. If such a Rule does not
|         specify a value for N between one and five, the value of N
|         is one.
| 
|     (b) In order to make a change Without N Objections, a Player
|         authorized to make a given change Without N Objections must
|         first post to the Public Forum eir intent to make such a
|         change, unambiguously describing the change to be made. The
|         change then takes place when a Player authorized to make
|         that change Without N Objections (who need not be the same
|         player who posted eir intent to make the change) posts to
|         the Public Forum that that change is made, and the following
|         conditions are fulfilled:
|       (1) the post announcing the change is made no fewer than four
|           days after, nor more than fourteen days after, the post
|           announcing the intent to make the change; and
|       (2) between the two posts, fewer than N Players posted to the
|           Public Forum objecting to the change.
| 
|     (c) This Rule defers to Rules which place further restrictions
|         on the effectiveness of changes made Without Objection.
| 
| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1664 be amended to read:
| 
|     (a) Any Player is either Abiding or Rebellious. A new Player is
|         always Abiding when e becomes a player. A Player can switch
|         from Abiding to Rebellious or from Rebellious to Abiding by
|         sending a message to the Public Forum saying e does change
|         so. The Registrar shall maintain a list of all Players that
|         are Rebellious. This list is known as the Red Pages, and is
|         part of the Registrar's Report.
| 
|     (b) A Player may Call for a Revolt at any time, by sending to
|         the Public Forum saying e does so. A Call for Revolt is only
|         effective if the following conditions are met:
|       (1) The player posting the Call is Rebellious,
|       (2) No other effective Call for Revolt has been made that
|           week, and
|       (3) A successful Revolt has not occured for a month or more.
| 
|     (c) As soon as possible after an effective Call for Revolt has
|         been posted, the Registrar must determine whether the Revolt
|         succeeds, as outlined below, and post the result to the
|         Public Forum.
| 
|     (d) The result of a Revolt is determined as follows: The
|         Registrar selects a random integer from 1 to the number of
|         Players at the time of the Call for Revolt. If this number
|         is less than or equal to the number of Rebellious Players at
|         the time of the Call for Revolt, then the Revolt succeeds,
|         otherwise it fails.
| 
|     (e) If a Revolt succeeds, then the following events occur (in
|         order):
|       (1) The Registrar shall vacate all Blots of each Rebellious
|           Player.
|       (2) The Registrar shall pay out 2 VTs to each Rebellious
|           Player.
|       (3) The Registrar is empowered and required to levy a tax of
|           75% on indulgences. The holder of the Patent Title
|           "Robespierre" is exempt from this tax, even if other rules
|           don't allow tax exemptions.
|       (4) A Speaker Transition occurs
|       (5) All Players that hold one or more Offices in the normal
|           fashion cease to hold those in a normal fashion and hold
|           them temporarily instead.
|       (6) All Rebellious Players become Abiding again
| 
|     (f) If a Revolt does not succeed, then:
|       (1) All Rebellious Players gain 2 Blots.
|       (2) The Player who Called for Revolt gains 2 (additional)
|           Blots
| 
|     (g) The Registrar shall execute all Payment Orders required by
|         this rule.
| 
|     (h) The Registrar is authorised to vacate any payment orders
|         this rule requires em to vacate.
| 
| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1643 be amended to read:
| 
|     (a) A document is a Statement of Policy if and only if it meets
|         the following requirements:
|       (1) it is posted to the Public Forum
|       (2) it claims, in these exact terms, to be a "Statement of
|           Policy"
|       (3) it specifies, by name, an Office which it pertains to
|       (4) that Office is held by its author.
| 
|     (b) A Statement of Policy, when issued, becomes an SLC, the
|         Jurisdiction of which irrevocably consists of the Player
|         holding the Office named therein. That Player shall also be
|         its Maintainer.
| 
|     (c) An Officer shall be permitted to change eir own Statement of
|         Policy by issuing a new version to the Public Forum.
|         Further, any Statement of Policy ceases to exist whenever
|         the Office it pertains to ceases to be held by the Player it
|         constrains.
| 
|     (d) Any violation of a SOP constitutes a Crime of Breach of
|         Policy, a Class 2 Crime.
| 
| Be it further resolved, that Rule 105 be amended to read:
| 
|     (a) A Rule Change is any of the following:
|       (1) The enactment of a new Rule;
|       (2) The repeal of an existing Rule;
|       (3) The amendment of the text of an existing Rule; or
|       (4) Any change to a substantive property of a Rule other than
|           its text.
| 
|     (b) A "substantive property of a Rule" is any property of that
|         Rule (other than its text) which determines in part or in
|         full the ability of that Rule to govern by itself or in
|         conjunction with other Rules.
| 
| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1723 be amended to read:
| 
|     (a) A Proposal is Sane if all the following conditions are met:
|       (1) the text of the message wherein it is submitted explicitly
|           states that it is a Sane Proposal,
|       (2) The Proposal is Interested,
|       (3) The Proposer has paid 2 P-Notes to the Bank, expressly for
|           this purpose (and not for any other). In order for this
|           payment to have effect, it must be made before the
|           Proposal is distributed.
| 
|     (b) Players may cast no more than one vote on a Sane Proposal.
|         Non-Player Voting Entities may not vote on Sane Proposals.
| 
|     (c) This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would allow
|         non-Player Voting Entities to vote on Sane Proposals, or
|         which would allow Players to cast more than one vote on a
|         Sane Proposal.

I'd prefer "excessive" over "unnecessary".

The odd date may be related to the fact that it's missing from the
logs--it may be that it was originally reported to have failed,
but later discovered to have passed, and that fact announced
on 10/29/93.
