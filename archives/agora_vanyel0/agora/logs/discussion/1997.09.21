Would it be abusing the Kudo system to deKudo one Player for
behaviour in another Nomic ? I'm tempted to take one away from Chuck
for stating that e was interesting in participating in the last
round of FRC and then failing to post anything, but I'd rather know
what y'all think of the notion first...

Um, actually, it's me. For years elm used to ask me if I wanted to
copy the message I was replying to, and I always said yes, which I did
by typing a 'y' after I'd hit 'r' for 'reply'. While fiddling with my
elmrc the other day I discovered that you can make elm copy the message
automatically without asking you, and so I've turned that option on.
But I haven't got out of the habit of replying to messages by hitting
'ry', so now the 'y' gets appended to the Subject line.

Bet you weren't expecting that answer!

So, actually, you *can* see how a descriptive sentence might be
an order to pay. Well, then, you're half way there! Now the argument
comes down to whether R1435 is, ultimately, such a Rule as I describe
above or not.

Hm, so why the does the Subject line say 'TRUE'? That's the second
time this has happened recently - and there's the 940/941 confusion,
too. 

Andre, watch your headers!

Well, let's follow this line of thought a little further. R1698 says
that any change to the game state which makes the adoption of Proposals
within a 4 week period impossible does not take place. Let's grant
that without VTs, this condition is met. The question we then have to
answer is: precisely which change to the game state, of the many
which occurred as the result of the adoption of P3533, is to be
cancelled?

In the case of the Infraction, I'm pretty sure the last time it
was reported was the last time it happened, which was September 1,
when I reported Harlequin, twice.  See the Registrar's Report of
that date.

Or, perhaps, a quirk of Steve's.

On the other hand, let's not be hasty in granting things to be the
case that might not be true. I've just remembered that we have
Speaker's Gratuity, which has been awarded twice to General Chaos
(once at the end of July and again at the end of August) and
Speaker's Gratuity, which General Chaos can award once a week to
whomever he feels like.  And since we can all declare Presence 
without having VTs, Quorum isn't an obstacle. So R1698 might not
be either!

Forgetting about the Speaker's Gratuity for a minute (after all,
the General probably has spent 4 VTs since July 15), what if the
Speaker can, but doesn't choose to, Patronise someone? Is it still
'possible' to adopt Proposals within the meaning of R1698?

Well, I don't think this counts as a statistical test, but pi also
fails the criterion for randomness of incompressibility, ie the
algorithm for computing pi is much shorter than pi itself. Hm,
perhaps that's the same as complete unpredictability. Oerjan?

Does now :) "clear as mud" is probably more idiomatic.

My view: if it's strictly speaking illegal, our esteemed Ambassador
should not violate our Rules by casting Agora's vote on INP 347, even
if such a vote would be legal by Internomic Rules. But is it strictly
speaking illegal? As far as I can see the Rules are silent about the
current situation; R1632 certainly doesn't say that the Ambassador
shall vote FOR an INP if *and only if* there is a Referendum result
in its favour.

I did a double take as well, But read what he actually said again:
the phrase "clear as ink" means the opposite of "clear and not muddy".
Which is just what you would expect.

Unless, of course, "klart som blekk" means "clear as ink", in which
case, my original puzzlement, and yours, stands.

That's not an objection, it's a research program. A number of possible
alternatives spring to mind, all of them interesting. Rotation on a weekly/
monthly/quarterly basis, according to a fixed schedule, or by election,
or by drawing random lots, or by negotation, or by contest...

Playing Nomic presents serious practical problems which need to be
addressed. What do you think we've been doing the last 4 years? :)

I don't know why people think Agora is small. A game of Diplomacy,
or poker, or Cosmic Encounter with 20 players would be considered
mindblowingly large. Gaming with 20 players is large scale gaming.
That's not to say that growing half an order of magnitude, or even
a whole one, wouldn't be very interesting. It would, however, present
extremely serious practical problems which would need to be addressed :)

Well, what do you expect from a process of design by committee? :)
Can you imagine trying to design Cosmic Encounter using Agoran
methods? It would take 20 years and it still wouldn't work!

Keep in mind that, if all VTs were destroyed, then all of the Payment
Orders the Bank has purported to pay were in fact not paid.  The Bank
has not created any VTs since Proposal 3533 was adopted.

But that's basically my point.  "Mark gains X Blots" is not sufficiently
unambigous, but even the addition of a single additional word can make it
so.  Without context the statement cannot be seen as having the authority to
do anything, while on the other hand "Mark hereby gains X Blots" at least
clearly is an attempt to make that happen in almost any context. Note that
for you to draw a distinction between the two possible meanings you had to
use two different context, while in my post I deliberately used no context
whatsoever.

Yes, but the statement has been being argued about by some without any
reference to the context.  Some have said that "Mark gains X Blots" is an
order.  But it cannot by itself be seen to be so.

But note that I deliberately did not provide any context to the statement at
all. The statement does not by itself give any reason to believe that it was
intended to result in the person being sentenced.  It could just be a
comment to the effect that he has been sentenced or it could be an order to
the effect that he is sentenced.  Without context to clarify exactly which
usage of that statement was intended I would think that one would have to
assume that no order was intended.  Otherwise, any reference to the
sentencing might be construed as itself being a sentence unless it carried a
specific disclaimer to the effect that it was not to be so construed.

"Mark receives X Blots" is at best ambigous while "Mark hereby receives X
Blots" can only be taken in one way (ignoring for the moment the debate over
what it means to receive a Blot).  Equivalently, any additional context that
makes it clear in what sense the statement is to be taken would also be
acceptable.  I would hate for it to be accepted that "Mark receives X Blots"
is an order and then have someone claim that any document that uses that
phrase just to report that it happened is a case of an illegal PO.

Yes, but I think you're missing the point.  Note that while I deliberately
gave no context to the statement, you had to in order to give a situation in
which the meaning was clearly that of an order.  The point is that the
statement "Mark receives X Blots" does not in itself allow the distinction
to be made.  By itself, the statement cannot be seen to be a legally binding
order to do anything.  Only by adding more to it, whether that be something
like the word "hereby" or additional context , can it be unambiguously
determined to be an order.

If the statements under scrutiny actually said "X receives Y Blots" (or
something equivalent) then it is the context that needs to be examined for
the statement itself can yield no insight.

OTOH, I should think that since the statement is ambiguous, a subsequent
posting by the poster stating eir intent at the time it was written should
be sufficient to resolve the matter.
Of course, this leaves open the possibility that someone may claim they
suffered a loss of some sort due to the time lag between original post and
clarification.

I take 1698 as requiring _some_ method for passing Proposals, even if it
should require our unanimous joint effort.  The situation where it only
requires the efforts of a majority, including the Speaker and the
Chancellor, should be legal.

So what?  Practically all statements are meaningless without reference
to the context of their utterance.  Attempting to interpret speech out
of context is foolhardy at best.

But in a real message, for example, from the CotC or someone in 
authority, reporting an offense, there clearly *is* a context, and one 
which implies that the statement is an order.

I think you would be wrong. There is no general allowance in Agora to
replace Rule-specified procedures by equivalent ones. Maybe it would be a
good idea to introduce one...

It's only small when you start trying to mirror real-life situations and

1) I believe we would have to fine-tune scarcity, even with a pure barter
system. Without any scarcity there will be no reason to make agreement; 
with too much, the same.

2) My suggestion is that a full-blown monetary economy is unlikely to
succeed. Nowhere did I claim that success requires going to the opposite
extreme and abolishing tradable commodities altogether.

A basic feature of the Indulgence system (when it is working) is that it
should be impossible to completely saturate the market. The above would
violate that.

There have been list problems. Maybe he sent a Rule but it bounced.

I guess that would be the technical term, yes. (Have you been reading the
recent sci.math discussion too?)

Pi is a bit more than compressible, though: there is an algorithm (in
fact, many) that works for all digits. In general, compressibility means
that there are algorithms for computing the first n digits, growing in
length slower than n.

Your attempts at preserving your sanity fail miserably, Steve.  In fact,
"klart som blekk" means crystal clear, or more precisely without doubt. 
"klart" = "clear", "som" = "as", "blekk" = "ink".

Now, how can this be? The answer is probably that "ink" is used in a
figurative sense, meaning "writing". So, it is not your average dubious
rumor or hearsay, it is actually in the newspaper, or something like that.
Probably a very ancient saying, from when people believed newspapers.

Excellent argument. I am starting to think that the POs and TOs should be
effective under Rule 754 - and that if they aren't, then it is 754 which
needs Amendment, not the Pragmatic Currency Rules.

So are there any small communities we could mirror? :-)

I agree.  But exactly that was going on at about the time I posted my first
message on the topic (though I freely admit that there were also posts that
discussed the statements context).  There were several posts to the effect
that "Mark gains X Blots" should be interpreted as a PO.  My point is that
the statement cannot be seen as such, at least not in the "explicit and
unambiguous" manner that the rules require.  The statement must be augmented
in some way (even if only by the inclusion of the word "hereby") to pass
that standard.  If the individuals who posted such messages meant the
statement to be in the context of the original messages they could have made
that clear.

But that is my point.  I was speaking to those who saying that the statement
alone could be seen as an order.  But since the Rules require that the
statement be unambiguous, this is not the case.  And I believe (correct me
if I'm wrong) that the Rules require the statement to be explicit in its
intent.  If that's true, it seems that the context given was not enough to
meet the standard.

I don't think the Rules require "the statement to be explicit." If 
anything requires that, it is CFJ 940. On the other hand, c.f. this text 
from the judgement of CFJ 943:

-------------------------------
Here's what the CotC said: "Blob commits the Infraction of Failing to 
Judge, an action which bears the penalty of 3 Blots."

A Blot has been defined in the rules. Thus, this sentence is equivalent 
to:

"Blob commits...an action which bears the penalty of 3 Payment Orders for 
1 Indulgence, the payees of which are the Bank." 

In my opinion, this 
"specifies exactly one source entity, exactly one destination entity, 
exactly one Currency, and a number of units of that Currency which is a 
positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ." 

The syntax and meaning of a 'penalty' makes it clear that Blob is the 
source entity, and the rest is clear.

My apologies.  I was under the mistaken impression that this was required.
I have since discovered that I was in error..... ( I wish I could find the
post that led me to that conclusion....  I'd like to reread it).

If the Rules do not say so then I stand corrected.  I thought saw a post to
the effect that they did but I most likely misinterpretted.

So if I were a player and were to post to the public forum the statement
"Blob commits the Infraction of Failing to Judge, an action which bears the
penalty of 3 Blots." would I be seen as just commenting on the fact or as
issuing an illegal PO (or whatever would be the result).  That statement
cannot alone be seen as either order or report of the facts.  I think it's
safer and simpler to require those issuing POs to be clear that such is eir
intent rather than require any and all future references to the incident to
carry a disclaimer that they are not a Payment Order.

Definitely agreed. Come on, people, don't dismantle things before we
even get them working! Wait until they *are* working, *then* dismantle

You are, however, the only ones suggesting that these flaws mean

Hmmm? Indulgences seem to be working almost as intended. The 
problems we have had (the "X Gains Y Blots" problem and the
recent spate of debt fulfillments) are all to do with 
problems with Pragmatic Currencies, and not with the idea
of Indulgences per se, which was functioning perfectly well
before PC was passed.

There is a difference between doing things a different way to
make for more interesting play, and doing things a different
way just to be difficult. This case falls squarely in the latter
category.

You would just be commenting on the fact, because there's nothing else 
you could be doing; you don't have the authority to execute a P.O. I 
agree that the rules need to be more specific.

You're probably thinking of CFJ 940, which states that POs must explicitly
list each of the four items neccesary. That CFJ has been appealed, though.

On itself I would have no problems with that. However:
1. There were 4 or 5 more for which this is true (including me, I did send
   in one, but at least one day late)
2. As Arnt (or how-is-his-name-again) posted, there have been some bounces
   on the list, so it might be that Chuck tried to post a rule, but couldn't.

Could you give me some insight on how to reconfigure elm? Since I have a
workstation on my own it's configured differently to what I was used to,
and I don't know how to change it.

But what if I did have the authority?  Would I have to include a disclaimer
with every comment I make?

No more than a judge, after sentencing a prisoner, has to make a 
disclaimer every time he repeats that sentence. In other words, at the 
point in the trial where the sentencing usually comes, the judge may say 
"John is sentenced to 10 years in prison." This does not mean that later, 
when his wife asks him what happened with that John guy he had been 
trying, and he says, "John is sentenced to 10 years in prison," that poor 
John now has 20 years in the clinker.

I don't think 754 applies - it refers to "spelling, grammar, or
dialect, or the substitution of a word or phrase by a synonym or
abbreviation". I think it specifically does not adress the meaning
of a term of phrase shifting depending on its context.

There is however a problem with ChrisM's Judgement in 943, because e
made much of eir parsing "received" differently from "gained", which
I suppose 754 should not allow.

I was not saying anything of the sort - I oughta resent that cheap
rethoric trick (but I don't). I did not agree that a descriptive
sentence in the indicative mood could conceptually *be* an order; I
provisionally agreed, for the sake of arguing about what 1435 might
or might not claim, that one could be *legally equivalent to* the
other, which is not quite the same thing (and the latter certainly
does not imply the former !)

Now, I *do* agree that in some rare circumstances, a simple
declarative sentence can be, unambiguously, an order. I am reminded
of this chilling scene in The Silence of the Lambs when the serial 
murderer tells the girl he has imprisoned in his basement, "It takes 
off its clothes and it rubs this cream into its skin...".

Scott's suggestion that a declarative sentence uttered by a person in
a position of authority might in the same manner 'conceal' an order
has merit, but I suspect that you'd have to take intent into account
for such a position to be relevant in the current debate. I simply do
not believe that former CotC Michael was, in the two purported POs
that CFJ 940 might still be relevant to, actually ordering anyone to 
do anything.

There is that - I'm actually more interested in the principle of the

Yeah, I got that too, so I guess it would be unsporting to make a 
fuss. Too bad though, I wanted that Round to take off.

Hey, let's just annex FRC, or invade it or whatever - that ought to 
breathe some life back into it. ;)

I don't have any preconceived notions as to what Indulgences should

What if - for reasons of eir own - the CotC includes this descriptive
sentences within eir case-sheet on that same CFJ, which case-sheet is 
then published several times after the original Infraction has been 
committed and reported ? Presumably if the CotC's being authorized to 
report this Infraction is what makes eir first report of it a PO, 
then later reports are also going to trigger a PO ?

In RL this is usually not the case.

But this is, after all, Agora.

Gross, Nebraska, perhaps? That used to be the smallest town.
Actually, I was thinking the best parallel for Agora wasn't
a nation or town, but a soap opera family...

Currently, Indulgences seem to be plenary, which I don't think
is what was intended.

Oh, I'm not *complaining*... :) I'm just pointing out that Indulgences
*have* "worked" in the past, and that the problems we're seeing with 
them right now aren't related to the actual idea of Indulgences, just
with the game mechanics common to *all* Currencies.

I do not believe "receive" and "gain" are synonyms. But even if they are, 
that has very little to do with my judgement. Just a quick instant replay:

------------- from Judgement of CFJ 943 -------------
"Blob commits the Infraction of Failing to 
Judge, an action which bears the penalty of 3 Blots."

A Blot has been defined in the rules. Thus, this sentence is equivalent 
to:

Blob commits...an action which bears the penalty of 3 Payment Orders for 
1 Indulgence, the payees of which are the Bank. In my opinion, this 
"specifies exactly one source entity, exactly one destination entity, 
exactly one Currency, and a number of units of that Currency which is a 
positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ." 

The syntax and meaning of a 'penalty' makes it clear that Blob is the 
source entity, and the rest is clear.

The message concerning Elde was phrased identically. elJefe's was phrased 
differently:

"elJefe receives 3 Blots committing the Infraction of Failing to Judge."

So elJefe receives 3 P.O.'s? This syntax would seem to indicate that 
elJefe is the pay*ee* of this transaction! But the Bank is already 
defined as the payee, by the definition of a Blot. So this does *not* 
specify exactly one source entity and one destination entity. Thus, the 
CotC *did* fail to execute the required P.O. for the 3rd infraction. 
However, as the statement of the CFJ alleges that the CotC failed in all 
*3* cases, it must be judged FALSE.

------------- end Judgement of CFJ 943 -------------

You see, the point is not a gain/receive distinction, but a simple 
application of the qualifications for being a P.O.    Two of the CotC's 
statements satisfied those conditions; one did not.

Actually, I still have the text of your Judgement - don't resend
that over and over. ;)

And I'm quite sure that "X receives Y Blots for doing Z" has, in the
past, been used interchangeably with "X has committed Z which bears a
penalty of Y Blots"; these two being synonymous, they should end up
being mapped to equivalent actions under any reasonable transform,
which your reasoning fails to do.

I am unconvinced that there is a significant difference between the
two categories of statement that you identified in your Judgement.

Exactly which ? I take it you're referring to Game Custom concerning 
mechanisms other than P/C, which is as you yourself pointed out only 
two months old, recent enough that I can't imagine what custom you 
would be talking about concerning P/C.

It would be helpful if you expanded a little bit on that reply.

Right. But we can reformulate the question. With no VTs in the Bank,
Salaries cannot be paid, the Speaker cannot receiver eir Gratuity,
nor Patronise. But the Chancellor is permitted to mint VTs for these
and other purposes. So the question becomes: if the Chancellor can, but
chooses not to, mint VTs when there aren't any in the Bank, is it still
'possible' to adopt Proposals within the meaning of R1698?

When Steve was Registrar, he, on occasion, posted the Registrar's
Report more than once in a given week (after having amended it in some
manner or another), complete with Salary Payment Orders.  I chose to
recognize these as restatements of the same Payment Orders, rather
than as instatements of new Payment Orders.  Since nobody has
challenged my decision in this matter, it has the force of Game
Custom.

No, I don't read sci.math. But I did take Information Theory with Chris
Wallace in 1991, and I've occasionally found it useful in discussions
with other philosophers about foundations of mathematics to keep abreast
of the various mathematical senses of 'random'.

There's a file called 'elmrc' which lives in the your .elm directory.
Read and edit.

I don't think anyone has been arguing that the statement alone is obviously
an order. It's R1435 that makes it order in certain contexts.

Precisely what the Rules require in this regard is exactly what's at
issue. R1596 requires specification of various things, but (I'm arguing)
these requirements are met by what R1435 says about Blots.

It's not the inclusion of 'hereby' that does the trick, though. Nor do
I agree that the discussion when you joined it was about the statement
"Mark gains 3 Blots" taken out of context. The context of the discussion
had been very clearly set up by the Judgement of CFJ 940 and in subsequent
discussion: we are talking about the statement "Mark gains 3 Blots" sent
in a message from the CotC to the PF for the purpose of reporting Mark's
penalty for committing the Infraction of Failing to Judge. In that context,
Scott and I have been arguing, that message counts as the execution of a
Payment Order or Orders for a total of 3 Indulgences. Talking about other
possible contexts is just a red herring.

By the way, when are we going to close this loophole and end Morendil's
fun? And Morendil, have you arranged for the disposal of Elde's
assets in a timely manner, as required by R1738? And have you made
similar arrangements for Blob, on Elde's behalf? 'In a timely manner'
is not defined in the Rules, but I think if you haven't done it by
now, a Court could reasonably find you to be in breach of R1738.

This Judgement looks sound to me. We are VT-less.

The use of cheap rhetorical tricks is prohibited by the Edinburgh
Convention on the Conduct of Argument. :) If I felt I had to resort
to them to win, I'd just concede defeat. It's not like anything
really important depends on the outcome.

You said: 'I cannot see how a descriptive sentence can be an order to
pay.' Since I count 'being legally equivalent to' as one way of
being, this seemed to me to be saying that Scott and I must somehow
be conceptually confused, which seemed a much stronger position than
you were hitherto defending. But now you seem to be saying that you
don't count 'being legally equivalent to' as one way of being. 

So, for the sake of conducting the argument in language whose meaning
we can agree on, let me ask you this: do you think that it is possible,
in principle, for a descriptive sentence to be legally equivalent to
an order to pay? If you consent to this, then the situation is as I
suggested: we only have to decide whether R1435 succeeds in establishing
such an equivalence. Of course, that 'only' is ironic: that's the actual
substance of the disagreement.

There's a file called 'elmrc' which lives in the your .elm directory.
Read and edit.

I don't think anyone has been arguing that the statement alone is obviously
an order. It's R1435 that makes it order in certain contexts.

Precisely what the Rules require in this regard is exactly what's at
issue. R1596 requires specification of various things, but (I'm arguing)
these requirements are met by what R1435 says about Blots.

It's not the inclusion of 'hereby' that does the trick, though. Nor do
I agree that the discussion when you joined it was about the statement
"Mark gains 3 Blots" taken out of context. The context of the discussion
had been very clearly set up by the Judgement of CFJ 940 and in subsequent
discussion: we are talking about the statement "Mark gains 3 Blots" sent
in a message from the CotC to the PF for the purpose of reporting Mark's
penalty for committing the Infraction of Failing to Judge. In that context,
Scott and I have been arguing, that message counts as the execution of a
Payment Order or Orders for a total of 3 Indulgences. Talking about other
possible contexts is just a red herring.

By the way, when are we going to close this loophole and end Morendil's
fun? And Morendil, have you arranged for the disposal of Elde's
assets in a timely manner, as required by R1738? And have you made
similar arrangements for Blob, on Elde's behalf? 'In a timely manner'
is not defined in the Rules, but I think if you haven't done it by
now, a Court could reasonably find you to be in breach of R1738.

This Judgement looks sound to me. We are VT-less.

The use of cheap rhetorical tricks is prohibited by the Edinburgh
Convention on the Conduct of Argument. :) If I felt I had to resort
to them to win, I'd just concede defeat. It's not like anything
really important depends on the outcome.

You said: 'I cannot see how a descriptive sentence can be an order to
pay.' Since I count 'being legally equivalent to' as one way of
being, this seemed to me to be saying that Scott and I must somehow
be conceptually confused, which seemed a much stronger position than
you were hitherto defending. But now you seem to be saying that you
don't count 'being legally equivalent to' as one way of being. 

So, for the sake of conducting the argument in language whose meaning
we can agree on, let me ask you this: do you think that it is possible,
in principle, for a descriptive sentence to be legally equivalent to
an order to pay? If you consent to this, then the situation is as I
suggested: we only have to decide whether R1435 succeeds in establishing
such an equivalence. Of course, that 'only' is ironic: that's the actual
substance of the disagreement.
