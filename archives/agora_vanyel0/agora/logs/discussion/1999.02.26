That was my point, but was I correct? I would appreciate a detailed
explanation of how the calculation of monthly Salaires now works, with
special attention being paid to the question of the time at which the
Registrar should measure the BOS for the purpose of paying monthly
Salaries.

No, there's a misunderstanding here. The order of events is:

1) Andre pays out non-zero salaries at the beginning of Feb.
2) Andre sets Salaries to zero for the next month.
3) Once set, this value can't be changed for the rest of the month.
4) At the beginning of March, Michael pays zero Salaries
5) During March, before the 25th, Michael is free to set Salaries 
   to a non-zero value.
6) At the beginning of April, Michael pays Salaries at the new rate.

So, in effect, we only go for one month (March) without salaries. We
were paid in Feb, and if Michael is willing, we will be paid again in
April.

Protoproposal Chaos58 [rev. 4]

Proposals may Order

Be it resolved, that Rule 1794 be amended to read:

      (a) Each Order is of one of the following classes:
        (1) Judicial: A Judicial Order is an Order executed by a
            Player while acting as a Judge.
        (2) Appellate: An Appellate Order is an Order executed by a
            Board of Appeals.
        (3) Administrative: An Administrative Order is an Order
            executed by an Officer in the course of performing the
            duties of that Office, except when those duties involve
            acting as a member of a Board of Appeals.
        (4) Legislative: A Legislative Order is an Order executed as
            part of the effect of the adoption of a Proposal.
        (5) Private: A Private Order is any Order not described above.

      (b) For the purpose of this Rule, the holder of any of the
          following positions shall be considered an Officer when
          performing a duty required by or a privilege permitted only
          by virtue of holding that position:
        (1) the Speaker;
        (2) the Recordkeepor of a Currency; or
        (3) the Trustee of an entity in Probate.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) A Proposal may contain one or more Orders.

      (b) The effect of adopting a Proposal which contains Orders is
          to execute those Orders.  Such Orders are known as
          Legislative Orders, are deemed to have been executed by that
          Proposal, and are deemed to have been executed as of the
          date of the proclamation of the Proposal's adoption.

      (c) Legislative Orders may not be stayed, vacated, or amended
          except:
        (1) by a subsequent Legislative Order;
        (2) by a Judicial Order issued only after a judicial finding
            that the Proposal containing the Legislative Order was not
            adopted, was barred from taking effect, or was invalid; or
        (3) by the Clerk of the Courts, but only for the purpose of
            staying such an Order during the pendency of a dispute
            which might reasonably lead to a judicial finding of the
            sort mentioned in subdivision (c)(2) of this Rule.

Protoproposal Chaos79 [rev. 5]

Organizational Reform

Be it resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) When a Judge Orders that an action be Rescinded, that action
          is considered to have never taken place, and all legal
          consequences of that action are nullified to the extent it
          is possible to do so.

      (b) A Judge shall Order an action Rescinded only when
          specifically authorized to do so by the Rules.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1528 be amended to read:

      (a) An Organization is a collective entity created by or
          recognized by these Rules.

      (b) Only those collective entities which these rules have
          created or recognized are Organizations.

      (c) Each Organization must have:
        (1) a Name, unique from that of every other Organization;
        (2) an Agent; and
        (3) a Charter.
          Any Organization which ceases to have each of the items
          listed above is subject to administrative dissolution, as
          defined elsewhere.  No Organization shall be created or
          recognized which does not have each of the items listed
          above.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) In a conflict between the Bylaws and the Charter of an
          Organization, the Charter takes precedence.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Each Organization in existence prior to the adoption of the
          Proposal which created this Rule is deemed to be an

          other Rules notwithstanding.  The Charter of each such
          Organization shall be its former SLC, the Agent shall be the

          characteristics set forth above by events occuring after the
          adoption of the Proposal which created this Rule.

      (c) This Rule shall take precedence over every Rule with which
          it conflicts.

Protoproposal Chaos78 [rev. 3]

Summary Adoption

Be it resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 3, to read:

      (a) The Proposer of any Proposal may cause it to be Adopted
          Without Objection, but only if the Proposal has not yet been
          distributed.

          its Proposer changes its status to Adopted in accordance
          with the procedure for performing changes Without Objection,
          but only if at that time that Proposal has not yet been
          distributed.

      (c) When a Proposal is Adopted Without Objection, it is removed
          from the Queue.

      (d) This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would prevent
          a Proposal from being Adopted Without Objection, and over
          any Rule which would prevent a Proposal Adopted Without
          Objection from being removed from the Proposal Queue.
