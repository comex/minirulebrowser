The above is hard to make out. You start by saying that the whole
thing pivots on what we take to be the set of things for which the
maximum is being found. Then you try to give your version of which
set that is. Except that what you then give is not a set. Neither
is the answer you attribute to me a set. Could be a little more
precise as to what you mean? At the moment I'm not either what you're
saying, or what argument you're attributing to me.

I think Morendil has probably put my argument for me as well as 
anyone. I interpret R206 as saying something like (and I claim that
R206 has in the past been interpreted as saying something like):

      There is a basic voting privilege of two votes for each Voting
      Entity. Other Rules can grant additional voting privileges to
      one or more Voting Entities for one or more Proposals, with the
      proviso that no Voting Entity shall exceed a maximum of five
      votes on any Proposal.

If we read R206 that way, Morendil agrees with me that R1766 is not
self-depriving, or, as I would put it, self-contradictory.

But even we don't read R206 that way, I still claim that your
argumentative task is much harder than mine. For on your interpretation, 
R1766 says something deeply silly: here, have two additional votes;
no on second thoughts, don't. I think we should only accept such an
interpretation of R1766 if we're absolutely forced to it. And I just
can't see that we're forced to it. A much more sensible interpretation 
is available, and just because it is available, it is to be preferred.

Don't you think that word 'Proposal', appearing at the top of the
document, is a clear indication that the document is intended to be
a Proposal?
<<

Note that (based on the current state of the discussion) the document
we are talking about (P3710*) is the mutilated version of a proposal
(probably yet unnumbered) which was proposed (correctly) before P3710*
came into being. So the word 'Proposal' at the top of P3710* indicates
that P3710* is derived from a document that was intended to become a
proposal, and was submitted with that intention.

You ask whether this word is "a clear indication that the document is
intended to _be_ a Proposal" (emphasis mine). However, 1483 requires
that the document contains a "clear indication that that text is
intended to _become_ a Proposal", which is a different matter. The
predecessor of P3710* once _was_ (and probably still is) a proposal;
but the mangled version P3710* was never intended to _become_ a
proposal.

The same difference applies to ordinary proposals: when they are sent,
marked as new proposals, to the Promotor or the PF for the first time
they are submitted; at later times, they may still be communicated to
the Promotor again (e.g. when they are distributed), and they may
still include the header 'Proposal', or even 'new proposal' or some
such phrase, but then these words indicate that the document already
_is_ a proposal, not that it is intended to _become_ one.

I think such a construction of Rule 206 would have to include 1766 
during what you call 'step 2'. The wording of 206 is quite clear on 
this point; it says, "two Votes, or what *other Rules* state".

But we still have a problem. Consider two ways of carrying out the 
computation you outline above :

1) Rule 206 says to start with two Votes
2) Rule 1766 says to increase that by two
3) Rule 1766 says not to increase that past the maximum allowed for 
that Player, which is now 4.
4) Rule 206 says not to increase that past 5.

and

1) Rule 206 says to start with two Votes
2) Rule 1766 says it can't increase that Player's Voting rights 
past the current maximum, which is two
3) Rule 1766 says to increase that Player's Voting rights by two, 
which fails due to 2)
4) Rule 206 says not to increase that past 5.

The problem is that we don't have any principles for resolving 
conflicting or contradictory provisions *within the same Rule*, or 
for determining precedence between such.

That would be prejudging the issue. Rather, the Promotor posted a
text which e claimed was Proposal 3710. If such a text can be deemed
to *be* Proposal 3710 (even though it clearly isn't the Proposal with 
the same Title that Swann submitted), then that Proposal was indeed 
distributed; but the issues of whether that text was P3710, or indeed 
whether that text was a Proposal, remain in doubt.

I think that the answer to that is straightforward : that
one-character typo substantially changes the effects of the Proposal,
because Rule Changes are applied literally - we even have a Rule to
that effect.

IMHO Rule 1368 is pretty clear that something can be placed in the
Queue only if it already is a Proposal. Also, it is quite ovbious
that Blob didn't intend that text to be a Proposal submission, so
how can we argue that there was a 'clear indication' that that text
was a Proposal submission ?

I have no experience with actual law, but what you state certainly 
applies in Agora. However, I would say that in specific instances 
differences of degree are only significant to the extent that the 
Rules permit us to ascribe them significance.

True, the judge would be setting precedent in this case.  Of course I would not
consider it unreasonable for the judge to use similar situations in which
precedents have already been set, i.e. apply provisions within the same rule
sequentially.

Even though Blob clearly didn't intend submitting a new Proposal, it is still
possible that e did so inadvertently (as Steve almost did).  I think we have
dug ourselves a hole in allowing Proposal submissions to be made without a
clear and explicit statement that the communication is intended to be a
Proposal submission.  The problem is that we have established strong game
custom that just sending text to the Promotor labeled as a Proposal is enough
to be a 'clear indication' that that text is intended to *become* a Proposal,
that is, we have allowed the 'clear indication' to be implicit.

Take my example again, of my placing a proposal of my own, as Promotor, in the
queue without have first sent or posted it.  Would you have argued that this
was illegal?  I would say not.  The label "Proposal" and the *intended* action
of placing it in the queue can be taken as an implicit 'clear indication' that
the text is intended to become a Proposal.  Taking actions only into account, I
think we would have to admit that Blob inadvertendly submitted a new Proposal.

However, we all know that Blob did not really intend this to *become* a
proposal and I find some merit in the argument that this prevents 3710* from
actually being a Proposal, since there are examples in Agoran criminal law
which allow a Player's actual intent to be taken into account.  Well, we'll see
how this plays out in court, I guess.  Whichever way it goes, I think we need
to change our interpretation of 'clear indication' to require an explicit
statement, along with the text, that a Proposal is being submitted.

I think not.  The power of an unadopted Proposal is defined by one of the
Rules created by Proposal 3710:

      In the specific case of Proposals, a Proposal shall have
      a Power equal to its Adoption Index.  In no case shall a
      Proposal take effect unless its Voting Index exceeds its
      Adoption Index, (or equals it in the case both equal
      Unanimity) and the Rules otherwise permit it to take
      effect.  A Proposal cannot create an instrument with a
      Power that exceeds the Proposal's Power.

Ørjan.

Re: DIS: P3710: Opinions sought

Blob asks:

>If I did propose P3710*, who paid for it?

I don't have a copy of the P-Note messages that were used to raise the
priority, but if they clearly referred to the original proposal, then P3710*
(if it was a proposal) was improperly distributed because it would have had
priority zero.  It's not clear to me from the Rule whether an illegally
distributed zero-priority proposal can be voted upon.  I guess it depends on
whether you take a pragmatic or platonic interpretation of R1770.  Certainly
there is no specific penalty specified for such an illegal distribution.

I don't agree, at least not completely.  It is certainly true that
the "clear indication" does not require an explicit statement,
and labelling something as a proposal *usually* clearly indicates
the submitter's intent that it becomes a Proposal.  However,
I do not think we can generalize this to blindly infer that
*any* text labelled as a Proposal constitutes a clear indication
that the text is intended to become a Proposal.

To put it another way: I would say that labelling something
as a Proposal and delivering it to the Promotor would constitute
prima facie evidence that the text is intended to become
a Proposal, but not conclusive evidence thereof.

Ah, that's what I was missing.  That'll teach me to look only
at my rules files, and not a possibly-adopted proposal, for
refuting evidence.  I should have remembered that the CounterScam
was dependent upon the poor wording of the Power-Limiting Rule
created by P3710.  Maybe I was confused because I had originally
conceived of the counterscam as relying on a different flaw I
believed to be in that Rule, which turned out not to be there
after all upon closer inspection.

Hmm, not sure if I said what I meant there.  What I meant was
that labelling something as a Proposal and delivering it to
the Promotor should be taken to mean that the text is intended
to become a Proposal, in the absence of any contrary evidence.
But then, that's what prima facie evidence means, doesn't it?
Oh well.

It's my impression that this *has* constituted conclusive evidence.  Do you
have a counter-example?

You are forgetting 3 important things:

Context, context, and context.

(As well as the rest of the top ten issues: context, context, context,
context, context, context and context.)

You cannot look only at _one_ property of the submission, like whether its
subject is "Proposal".  You cannot even look solely at the message text.

You have to look at who sent the message, how they sent it, who they sent
it to, _and_ what the message says.

For there to be a clear indication that some text is intended to be a
Proposal, all those factors must support it.  Basically, if someone
watching the process would think it was an intended submission, it was.
(Even if it was done by error and not actually intended.)

In particular, any message placed in the Queue by the Promotor will not be
submitted at that point if the Promotor (not being Blob) simultaneously
registers _Blob_ as the Proposer.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

For me, this is the most convincing argument against 3710* being a proposal,
when taken together with Chuck's clarified comment about "prima facia"
evidence.

You lost me here a little.  If you are saying that the only way placing
proposal text into the queue causes that text to *become* a Proposal is for the
Promotor to register emself as the Proposer when doing so, then I agree with
you.

Game custom is that such contradictions are worked out on a case by case
basis as they arise. Chuck and I once had a long and involved discussion
about why this was preferable.

However, the real point to be made here is that we do have available
to us another principle, which says that self-contradictory
interpretations of Rules are to be avoided where possible. As your
post shows, it manifestly is possible to avoid such an interpretation
here, simply by opting for the first method.

We have for comparison the current case of the illegally distributed,
non-zero Priority Proposal 'Zeitgeist and scarce Currencies'.

If you say you know that, without my ever having told you so, then there
must have been something in the way it was published that makes you think
so. If that is the case, how can you claim that their was a clear 
indication that it was supposed to become a proposal.

In other words, if it is bleedin' obvious that it was not supposed to
become a proposal, how can you claim that it was?

This nit-picky part of Agora really frustrates me. It was a typo. 
It should just be fixed and then forgotten.

This was *not* illegally distributed, because at the time of distribution, the
higher priority proposal had not yet been placed in the queue.  However, I
prefer the pragmatic interpretation anyway.

It is obvious from the context, as Oerjan pointed out, that you never intended
it to be a new proposal.  My claim was that in the past we never have seemed to
bother with such intent, that only the actions counted and game custom seemed
to have made these particular actions themselves enough of a 'clear
indication'.  However, I think I have been persuaded by Oerjan, Chuck, and
Kolja that the context here is clear enough to outweigh the actions themselves
and so 3710* was not a new Proposal.

Actually, I agree with you here.  The text distributed was an unambiguous
reference to the original proposal, especially since the typo was of such a
minor nature.  If we were to use common sense, it should fall under R754.

In this game, common sense defers to Rules 107 and 1339.

Rule 107 ensures that the distributed text is the one that counts, if any.

Rule 1339 ensures that typos cannot be ignored when they are part of Rule
text to be replaced or inserted.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

!?! But that assumes that Players will use these VTs to buy Plots. If
they don't, VT scarcity will have disappeared at a stroke. (25 VTs
each?? Gulp!) If you want to ensure that Players have some initial
Plots, then give each Player 1 Plot to start with. But please, put
it back to 5 VTs.

The other changes I like.

I just found this little nit in R1542:

      Every time a Proposal is distributed, the Wizard has the option
      of changing the Style of the Player who submitted that Proposal,
      as long as that Player is not the Wizard.  The Wizard may only
      change the Style of Players whose Proposals were distributed
      after e became Wizard.

Now consider the Proposals distributed by Crito on March 16, while
General Chaos was Wizard-Delegate. Am I allowed to make Style changes
for these Proposals? On the one hand, they were ditributed after I
was last Elected Wizard. On the other hand, they were distributed
before I most recently resumed being the Wizard. What do people
think?

PROTO: Electees v0.9
####

Rename Rule 1555 ("Retirement and Removal From Offices") to "Electees and
Removal From Offices," and amend it to read:

      Any Player who holds an Office by virtue of having won an
      Election for that Office is called the Electee to that
      Office.

      When an Electee to an Office is retired from that Office,
      e ceases to be the Electee for that Office. When an Electee 
      to an Office is removed from that Office, e ceases to be
      Electee to that Office, and if e currently holds the Office,
      the Speaker shall become the holder of that Office, unless 
      another Rule specifies a different Player who is to become 
      the temporary of that Office. 

{Comment:

Changed this paragraph to deal with situations where an Electee is removed
or retired from an Office which e does not currently hold.
}

      When a non-Electee Player is removed from an Office, that
      Office shall become held normally by the Electee of that
      Office, if there is an Electee. Otherwise, the Office shall
      be held temporarily by the Speaker.

      If a Player goes On Hold, deregisters, or is deregistered, 
      e shall be removed from all Offices e holds.

Amend Rule 790 ("Filling Vacant Offices") to read:

      Whenever there is an Office with no current Electee, for
      which an Election is not currently being conducted, the
      Registrar shall initiate an Election for that Office,
      as described elsewhere, unless the Office is that of
      Registrar; in that case, the Speaker shall conduct the
      Election. 

Amend Rule 1486 ("Procedure to Impeach an Officer") to read:

      Any Active Player is permitted to call a Referendum to  
      Impeach an Officer at any time, by requesting such in 
      the Public Forum. The Officer is Impeached when such a
      Referendum is passed.

      The Referendum must list both the Office and the current
      Electee to that Office by name. If upon passage of the
      Referendum the named Player is the current Electee of
      that Office, then the Player is immediately removed
      from Office.

      For this Referendum the default procedure for referenda is
      modified as follows: Vote Collector is the Player who called for
      the Impeachment Referendum. Voting Entities do not include the
      Officer under consideration for Impeachment. Adoption Ratio must
      be greater than or equal to 2 for the Referendum to pass.

Amend Rule 1644 ("Dereliction of Duty") by replacing the text:

      (i)   holds an Office in the normal fashion whose duties include
            the weekly production of an Official Report, and

with the text:

      (i)   is the Electee to an Office which e currently holds, and 
            whose duties include the weekly production of an Official 
            Report, and

Amend Rule 1664 ("Rebellion") by replacing the text:

      - All Players that hold one or more Offices are retired from all
        such Offices.

with the text:

      - All Players who are currently Electees to one or more Offices
        cease to be Electees to those Offices.
        
Amend Rule 1645 ("Temporary Delegation of Offices") to read:

      An Electee to an Office who currently holds that Office is 
      permitted to appoint another Player to perform the duties of that 
      Office, for a Period not exceeding two weeks. This is called 
      Delegation; the Player doing the appointing is herein referred to 
      as the Delegating Player and the Player so appointed is herein 
      referred to as the Delegated Player.

      An Office is legally Delegated if and only if the following
      conditions are met:

      (i)   the Delegating Player has posted to the Public Forum a
            Notice of Delegation, naming the Office being Delegated
            and the Delegated Player;

      (ii)  the Delegated Player is permitted by the Rules to hold
            the Office at the commencement of the Period of
            Delegation;

      (iii) the Delegated Player has posted, within the week
            immediately preceding or immediately following the
            posting of the Notice of Delegation, and to the Public
            Forum, a Notice of Consent to Delegation for that Office;

      (iv)  the Delegating Player is still the Electee to the
            Office, and still holds the office at the commencement
            of the Period of Delegation;

      (v)   the Period of Delegation has commenced and not yet
            concluded.

      The Period of Delegation commences at the time the Notice of
      Delegation is posted, or at the time the Notice of Consent to
      Delegation is posted, or at the time (if any) specified by the
      Delegating Player, whichever is latest. The Period of Delegation
      concludes two weeks after the Period of Delegation commences, or
      at the end of the Term of Service for the Delegated Office, or
      at the time (if any) specified by the Delegating Player,
      whichever is earliest.

      During the Period of Delegation, the Delegating Player ceases
      to hold the Delegated Office; the Delegated Player holds the
      Office temporarily, and earns the Salary for that Office as
      described in other Rules. At the end of the Period of 
      Delegation, the Delegated Player ceases to hold the Delegated
      Office, and the Delegating Player resumes holding the Office,
      if e is permitted to do so. If not, the Speaker holds the
      Office.

Amend Rule 880 ("Resignation of Offices") to read:

      A Player may, at any time, resign from any Office which e
      currently holds. 

      An Electee to an Office who resigns from that Office may
      appoint a successor at the time e resigns. In this case,
      the resigning Player is retired from that Office; if the 
      named successor agrees in the Public Forum to be successor 
      to the Office, the named successor becomes holder of the 
      Office.

      A non-Electee who resigns an Office, or an Electee who
      does not name a successor, is immediately removed from
      Office.

{Comment:

Changed this Rule to fix mistake with 'retire'/'resign' terminology.
}

Amend Rule 1758 ("Holding an Office In Perpetuity") by replacing the text:

      If a certain Office is held in the normal fashion by a Player,

with the text:

      If a Player is the Electee to an Office which e currently holds,

Amend Rule 1659 ("The Right to Call Elections") by replacing the text:

                 This Right is exercised by posting an announcement
      in the Public Forum that both lists a number of Offices
      currently held in normal fashion, and declares that the Speaker
      is exercising eir Right to call these Elections.  

with the text:

                 This Right is exercised by posting an announcement
      in the Public Forum that both lists a number of Offices
      currently held by their Electees, and declares that the Speaker
      is exercising eir Right to call these Elections.  

and the text:

      all such Offices listed in this post are then held temporarily.

to the text:

      the Electees of these Offices shall cease to be the Electees to 
      those Offices.

Amend Rule 1450 ("Speaker Cannot Stay CotC or Justiciar") to read:

      If at any time the Speaker shall be the Electee to either
      the Office of CotC or the Office of Justiciar, e shall be
      retired from whichever of those Offices e is Electee to.

Amend Rule 910 ("The Justiciar") by replacing the text:

      If the Player holding the Office of Justiciar becomes either
      Speaker or Clerk of the Courts, e is immediately retired from
      the Office of Justiciar.

with the text:

      If the Justiciar ever becomes Clerk of the Courts, e is removed
      from the Office of Justiciar.

Amend Rule 1652 ("When the Speaker is Tainted") by replacing the text:

      and the Office of
      Speaker-Elect is held in normal fashion.

with the text:

      and the Office of Speaker-Elect is held by its Electee.

and the text:

      only until some other
      Player holds the Office of Speaker-Elect in normal fashion

with the text:

      only until the Office of Speaker-Elect is held by an
      Electee who is not the Speaker.

This is always the problem when people try to over-legislate everything.
The human mind is a wonderful thing -- it can classify something simply by
looking at it, based on very subtle criteria. Trying to do the same thing
with Rules is almost certain to fail.

Personally, I think that the Proposal should just be treated as it was
supposed to be, but that's just me and is a thought on How It Should Be,
not How It Is.
