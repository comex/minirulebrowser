I don't believe this has any confusing effects, by the way. Blob
simply created his Contest an hour earlier than we first thought.
His second attempt was not a valid ACO, and therefore had no effect,
since it attempted to create an Organization with the same name as
an existing Organization. See R1533.

Higher Quorum is not a punishment, but a protection against abuse
by a small clique.

I just figured that, hey, if we have the concept lying around, we might as
well use it. I really don't see any disadvantages to it...

That's how I intend to do it. If I just replace "must" with "may," and
specifically define Recordkeepors for everything that needs them...

But shouldn't the exclusion of some players from the powerful circle
of voters make scamming easier? This would seem a consistent situation
to me: if you can't vote, you make it easier for others to scam. At
the moment this is not the case.

BUS: Pass the Parcel Contest

I'd like to be a contestant in "Pass the Parcel", although I am concerned that
I do not have the software necessary to use the public encryption keys that
will be sent as a part of the contest.

[Note from the Distributor: this message was trapped by majordomo
because Blob sent it from an address from which he is not subscribed.
Note that it is datestamped an hour before his subsequent message
executing an ACO, sent from his regular address to the PF.]

This is an Application to Create an Organisation.

In order to celebrate the occasion of Agora's fifth Birthday, there 
shall exist a Contest called "Pass the Parcel", with Blob as the 
Contestmaster.

The Regulations of the Contest are as follows:

1. The Music

   Any player may become a Contestant by informing the Contestmaster
   that e wishes to do so, provided that this is done before mindight
   GMT on the morning of July 29. At that time, the Music shall begin.

   After the Music has begun, no more Contestants will be accepted. 
   A Contestant may leave the contest at any time, by informing the
   Contestmaster that e wishes to do so. Contestants may also be
   required to leave the Contest, as the Regulations dictate.

2. The Parcel

   There exists an entity called "The Parcel" which is at any given
   moment in time, held by one Player. Initially the Parcel is held
   by the Contestmaster. The Player holding the Parcel may pass it
   to another Contestant, by posting a message to the Contestmaster
   and all Contestants stating that e does so. 

3. Seating Arrangements

   The Contestmaster shall keep an ordered list of all Contestants.
   This list is called the "Seating List", and shall be sent to
   all Contestants. After the Music begins, the Contestmaster may
   not change the Seating List, except to remove any Contestants
   who leave the Contest.

4. The Layers

   The Parcel has five Layers, each of which contains a certain 
   number of VTs. Before the Music begins, the Contestmaster shall
   select, at eir discretion, the number of VTs contained in each
   Layer, such that the total number of VTs in the Parcel is no
   less than five. 

   The contents of each layer shall be written down by the 
   Contestmaster, and encrypted using a Public Key Encryption
   algorithm. The encrypted message, and the public encryption key
   shall be sent to all Contestants. Otherwise, the Contestmaster
   shall not reveal the contents of each Layer until that Layer 
   is opened. 

5. The Music Pauses

   The Music shall pause four times, at times selected by the 
   Contestmaster. These times shall lie between midnight (GMT +1200) 
   on the morning of July 29, and 11:59 PM (GMT +1200) on July 30.

   Before the Music begins, the Contestmaster shall write down these
   four times, encrypt them using a Public Key Encryption algorithm, 
   and send the encrypted message, and the public encryption key to
   all Contestants. Otherwise, the Contestmaster shall not reveal
   these times to any Player until after they have passed.

   When the Music pauses, a Layer of the Parcel shall be opened,
   and the Player who held the Parcel immediately before the Player
   who currently holds it, shall receive the contents of that Layer.

6. The Music Stops

   The Music stops at midnight (GMT +1200) the night of Agora's 
   Birthday.
   
   At this time the fifth and final Layer of the Parcel shall be
   opened, and the Player who held the Parcel immediately before 
   the Player who currently holds it, shall receive the contents 
   of that Layer.

7. Passing the Parcel

   As soon as possible after the Music begins, the Contestmaster
   shall Pass the Parcel to the first Contestant on the Seating List.

   Thereafter, the Contestant who hold the Parcel shall pass it to 
   the next Contestant on the List, with the last Contestant on the
   List passing to the first Contestant on the List.

   If a Contestant passes the Parcel to any other Contestant, other
   than as proscribed above, then e shall leave the Contest.

   If a Contestant holds the Parcel for more than six hours straight,
   e shall leave the Contest, and the Parcel shall automatically be
   passed to the next Contestant on the List.

8. Currency Transfers

   All currency transfers required by these Regulations shall be 
   made by the Contestmaster as soon as possible after the 
   Contest has sufficient funds to do so.

9. Dissolving the Contest

   After the Music has stopped, and all required Currency Transfers
   have been made, the Contestmaster shall dissolve the Contest.
   Any currencies remaining in the Contest Treasury at this time 
   shall be transferred to the Contestmaster.

Yeah, I just discovered that one too. 

But I also just realised that I didn't sign the Application, so 
the Contest does not exist yet. AFAICS, that means I am free to

Indeed, I think it would.  No problem for the VT penalty, but I don't know what
the interpretation is for halving the Indulgence penalty below the MUQ of
Indulgences.  Anyone aware of any precedents for this?
