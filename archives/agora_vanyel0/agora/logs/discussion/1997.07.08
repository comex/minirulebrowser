Question: does this mean that I (can|must) perform any Wizardly duties
heretofore neglected by Zefram?  Or (can|must) I only perform those
which arise after being backhanded into the job?

An interesting question. Rule 1585 covers the case of Officer change,
and answers the question in the affirmative. But this is not quite
a case of Officer change, since there is no prior holder of the Office.
The Rules appear to me to be silent about the current case, which is
not surprising, as it has never really arisen in quite this form before.

It would seem we have two alternatives: we could say that the current
situation is enough like Officer change to warrant an extension of the
application of R1585 beyond the authority literally given it by its
provisions. I think to do this we would need to CFJ and invoke R217.
Or we can say that since no Rule hands you Zefram's responsibilities,
they cannot have come to rest with you, perhaps relying on R1011 to make
the point.

I'm not entirely sure which course I prefer, but I think it might be
the latter.

I'm wondering about how R1586 might apply.  It seems reasonable that
the obligations of an entity are properties of that entity; as such, I
think the obligations of the Wizard are properties of such.  Rule 1586
suggests that such obligations survive "to whatever extent is possible
under the new definition".  The question, therefore, becomes to what
extent the extant obligations of Zefram as Wizard inhered to Zefram
personally and to what extent they inhered to the "position" of the
Wizard, and, of the latter, to what extent it is possible for those
obligations to persist under the new definition of the Wizard.

I think we really need to put more thought into the creation,
satisfaction, persistence, transferrability, and extinction of
obligations, especially when the Rules which create them are changed.

Steve> might be the latter.

I would too, if for no other reason than that it saves me from having
to find out what Zefram left unfinished.

An interesting result. If I may enquire of you, Chuck and Murphy, if you

on Agora is both ludicrous and insulting.

I must wonder, will Uri quiz _all_ future applicants to Rishonomic
with the same insulting questions he insultingly places before those
of us who he has summarily and without cause ejected from the game?
All I did was vote for a few proposals, and hand down one apparently
uncontroversial judgement.  Surely this is no cause for summary
ejection!

Rishonomic has demonstrated, in word and deed, its hostility to the
Nomic Community.  I will not kowtow to the misplaced hostility of an
inferior, upstart Nomic.  I shall not answer the proffered questions.

In outrage,

>>Lets see. There are 18 players, so a one-man revolution has a 1 in 18
chance of success. You gain 3 Blots per failed revolt (if you issue the
CFR), and can only revolt once per week. You also gain 1 Blot per week
for Debt.

Thus, you have ceiling(30/4) = 8 chances to revolt before becoming 
Lawless.

So you have:

1/18 + 1/18 * 17/18 + 1/18 * (17/18)^2 + ... + 1/18 * (17/18)^7
~= 1/3, chance.<<

Of course, this assumes that there is only one rebellious player at 
the time, right? With more of them, chances for success grow
considerably, especially if the rebels take turns issuing the CFR.

But then that is beginning to sound like fun - like a "real"
revolution as you wrote:

>>A Rebellion could be the act of a righteous few fighting 
against their oppressors, or of a lawless few seeking to take
control. :) <<

So why not try it?

I'm really sorry I can't pat you on the back and make my voice sound
all sympathetic and soothing, using eMail - but calm down, General,
calm down, you'll develop an ulcer if you get upset so easily. It's
the tough world of diplomacy, so what do you expect? :) :)

Anyway, on a more serious note this reminded me of an idea that
occurred to me during the recent flurry of discussions about diplomacy
and sanctions against nomics that don't behave. What would you think
about Internomic sanctions against "undercover agents", like

 Whenever a player of an Internomic member nomic registers as a player
 of another Internomic member nomic e is required to state clearly eir
 player status and any special offices/functions/positions (*) e holds
 in this Nomic. If e does not, and this is confirmed in an Internomic
 CFJ, all Internomic Nomics e was a player of before the new
 registration shall loose 5 points.

(*) insert a term here which is generic enough to cover the structures
of various Nomics - but you understand what I mean, I hope.

Remarks:

- Is there a general consensus about the identity of a player,
i.e. this expression referring to a real life person, not a particular
Nomic-nickname? Otherwise this would have to be made clear here (or in
a new internomic rule like our Rule 1432 (time to get some order into
Internomic, too ;)

- Yes, this does mean that a Nomic is punished for the behaviour of
eir individual players. What else could Internomic level sanctions do
without interfering with the sovereignty of the individual nomics?
(And the same happens with soccer clubs and their misbehaving fans, as
someone noted a couple of weeks ago). 

Of course it would be interesting to see how Nomics safeguard against
this: internal Rules that make this Internomic rule local law, and/or
internal sanctions against trespassers.

And it would allow "abuse", too: damaging a Nomic by registering with
it properly, and then misbehaving elsewhere.

- Note that this does not mean that every registration involves a
brutal cross examination like that our Ambassador has had to endure ;)
- it deliberately says nothing whatever about the intentions or plans
of the applying player, only about hard (and, in principle, public)
facts. It would not outlaw invasions, just make them visible - with
all the diplomacy of telling another Nomic "We are friends and coming
in peace" in a credible way.

I think this would be a step towards basic rules of conflict that
outlaw some of the things we consider amoral, but do not resort to
limiting conflicts to the playground (like some of the duelling
ideas).

The phrase "this Nomic" is unclear; which of the two Nomics do you refer
to ? IIRC In principle "this" refers to the closest antecedent, i.e. the Nomic
where that Player would be registering in while also a member of the former
Nomic; if, as I assume, you mean that e should specify what their status is
in the Nomic e is already a Player of I think you should use "that Nomic".

In principle I am against any legislation of a Player's Nomicality - our
analogue to nationality. I wouldn't like any restriction, however benign
in intent, on my rights to circulate freely within the Nomic Community.
In addition, I hold that a Nomic should be free to adopt any kind of
immigration policy it likes, provided naturally that the basic rights of
the Players are respected by its legislation.

If Rishon wants to subject immigrant Players to a detailed questionnaire,
so be it - I certainly don't approve, but neither do I think such a move
would be unfounded in light of recent events. ;)

Personally, I view the multiple concurrent registrations with many
Nomics of some Players among us with some bemusement - Agora already
takes up too much of my leisure time, and it's surprising to me that
one can find the time to seriously play in more than one Nomic. But
I'll vigorously defend the right to multiple Nomicalities.

> - Is there a general consensus about the identity of a player,

Well, Agora's own Game Custom in the matter could be transposed into
an IN Judicial decision, I guess, since it makes a lot of sense - I'm
not aware of any Nomic which has legislation with the opposite effect,
is anyone ?

That wouldn't necessarily be a Bad Thing, though it would IMHO require
much care and many safeguards. Note though that IN Points are really
less than exciting - member Nomics seem to care little for them. I'm
going to post an INP one of these days to the effect of eliminating
INPoints and replacing them with Rank - giving a few chosen privileges
to the First Among Nomics, i.e. the Nomic that Ranks first, and naturally
specifying how a Nomic is Promoted or Demoted.
