Indeed.  An interesting situation, given past precedent on such
matters.

R1583! Well spotted! Yes, I'd say they were. Which leaves us with
a tricky question to answer: how are we going to penalize you half
a Blot?

I am waiting to be convinced to vote.  Not all Proposals are worth equal
amounts to me.  I would rather save my VT to cast on a Proposal to foil a
potential scam (or even better, a Scam Proposal of my own), than to spend
it attempting to repeal Delayed Transfer Orders (for example).

Face it: VTs are more valuable now; it's harder for a Proposal to be worth
spending 1 VT on.

In my own case, I am down to my last 2.7 VTs, and earn 0.2 VT each week.  I
should on average cast ONE vote every five weeks.  If I fall below that
average, then you can complain.

Regards,

My apologies. My question was really directed to those with VT holdings
near the VTCL. Clearly, subsisting on unemployment benefits does not make
it easy to vote.
