It's true that "John Smith is sentenced to 10 years in prison" can be just a
descriptive statement, but it doesn't have to be just that.  For the reporter
standing outside the courthouse, this is descriptive.  For the judge sitting on
the bench presiding over the sentencing hearing, it is a command.  It is not
necessary for the judge to insert the word "hereby" into that sentence.  It is
the authority of the judge and the context in which e utters it that turns this
statement into a command.

Unfortunately for this argument, the statement in question, "Blob gains 3
Blots", was made in a context and by a person with authority that is equivalent
to the judge sitting on the bench rather than the reporter standing outside the
courthouse.

No, let me elaborate. I am suggesting we ration various game powers.
So maybe I could vote and make CFJ's, while Scott could hand out 
Indulgences, Steve could propose and vote, Chris could Judge CFJ's and
propose, etc. Thus I would be forced to barter if I wanted to
make a proposal or get Indulgences, etc. How we decide who gets
what would need much discussion, of course.

I don't think contract law is necessary in such a small society.
Those who don't keep their promises will find their powers reduced
as fewer people trade with them. The alternative is the formation
of small groups that are collectively self-sufficient, but who
don't trade with other groups. Such a situation would be
interesting, IMO. Contract law by itself does not encourage
the formation of an economy, as we have found.

I too am surprised at the low level of interest. For all the
talk of economy, it seems ours is currently crippled at best.
I would like to reach a consensus on this--I am currently assigned
to the appeal of CFJ 930, covering substantially the same
ground, and I would like to be consistent if possible.

  There are some metaphysical ascpects to consider, as well. Rule
1569 seems to say all Currencies without a Mintor are destroyed.
But, clearly they haven't been: they are still being recorded,
used, etc. Could we use this functional continuity, even if illegal,
to help us over the transition when there was no Mintor? If
not, who is currently violating the Rules? The various Recordkeepors?
The owners of the Currencies? All of us? One reason I prefer my
interpretation is that it clearly assigns responsibility to the
individual holders to see that their Currency is destroyed.

  It would be interesting to see how long we can keep these
Currencys going, even if they do prove ephemeral. It would
require the cooperation of a few Officers, plus at least the
tacit cooperation of a majority of Players. So far, we seem
to have that. As long as someone keeps track of them according
to the present Rules, I will be willing to make use of them.

"Mark gains a Payment Order for 3 Indulgences from emself to the Bank."

Or, if you prefer (I don't), "Mark gains 3 Payment Orders, each for 1
Indulgence from emself to the Bank".

No, I'm claiming 1435 is not such a Rule.

We could interpret the Rules in such a manner that 'superseded'
means 'contradicted by information in a subsequent report', i.e. if
two consecutive reports are formally consistent - no error is 
corrected in the second that was in the first - the Ratification 
process is going to conform the Game State to what the _second_ 
document reflects anyway, so you could claim that the first has not 
been 'superseded'. I agree that it's not the intuitive meaning of 
'superseded', but I submit that the way the Ratification process 
works makes it the logical meaning.

> No argument from this quarter.  However, I saw no evidence of any game custom
> or previous decisions that contravened Vlad's interpretation.

Actually there was. I just looked it up... and interestingly, CFJ
852, which essentially states the same position as the one you're
defending, and which was, ironically, first assigned to Vlad, who
defaulted on it, was finally Judged TRUE by Judge Wes. Its statement
was, "Rule 1467 should be interpreted so that only the Mintor of a
Currency may destroy units of that Currency".

But I am still claiming that 933 is FALSE. First, because the
Statement of 852 could very well be taken to mean "only the Mintor
(of all Players) may destroy units of a Currency". But, more
important, because we have Game Custom to the effect that the Rules
*could* and *did* call for the destructions of units of Currencies
under essentially the same conditions as currently obtain, at more or 
less the same time that Wes returned this strange Judgement.

We once had this Currency named Win Tokens; basically when you had 
enough of them you Won the Game, and the Rule which called for that 
also stated "At that time, all Win Tokens are destroyed". Around this 
time I suggested that this would result in the first Player winning 
in this way getting infinitely many Wins, as Rule 1467 would prevent 
WTs from being destroyed; setting aside the long debate in which I ws 
finally convinced of the contrary, the historical evidence is that no 
one Player did get infinitely many Wins, and the Win Tokens were 
destroyed as called for by the Rules.

*That* is Game Custom.

> Are you saying that a single ruling cannot establish game custom? 

Not at all. I'm only saying it's pretty rare, and happens for good
reasons, that do not necessarily have to do with a Statement being
Judged TRUE. Again, my contention is that it happents when a Judge
makes a useful contribution to our 'toolbox' of interpretative
traditions, such as the "technical domain" criterion, which lets us
make sense of unclear parts of the Rules.

See above - IMHO history proves Vlad wrong.

I'm enjoying this discussion!  The essential question is whether a Rule
could perform direct modifications on the Ruleset (though possibly avoiding
the use of "rule-changes").

For example, suppose the Players (starting with the initial ruleset) got
together and adopted:

---------------------------
Rule 301.  This Rule takes precedence over all Mutable rules.  Upon
creation of this Rule, Rule 103 is modified to read: "A rule-change is the
amendment, creation or repeal of any Rule or Rules. If proposed and
supported by a majority vote, it is adopted and takes effect."
---------------------------

This a Rule, so the Players have to follow it, unless it conflicts with a
Rule of higher precedence.

It takes precedence over 201-213, so we needn't worry about them.

Rule 116 requires that the change can only take place if a Rule permits it,
but that's all right since Rule 301 permits the change.

The modification is an amendment to an immutable rule; according to the
initial wording of Rule 103, this is not a "rule-change".  Hence Rule 301
cannot conflict with rules 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, or 111.  Does 103
prevent it from taking effect?

Possibly.  But it would be consistent instead to take 103 as specifying
some ways to modify the Rules without precluding the possibility of others.
Indeed, if the exclusive meaning was meant, Rule 116 really should read
something like:

   Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a rule is permitted and
   unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the rules, which is
   permitted only by means of rule-changes.

instead of its actual wording.


=======================================================================
Excerpts from the initial Suber rules:

103. A rule-change is any of the following: (1) the enactment, repeal, or
amendment of a mutable rule; (2) the enactment, repeal, or amendment of an
amendment of a mutable rule; or (3) the transmutation of an immutable rule
into a mutable rule or vice versa.

116. Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a rule is permitted and
unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the rules, which is
permitted only when a rule or set of rules explicitly or implicitly permits
it.

How can you 'gain' a PO ? A PO is a message. And this is still
descriptive; are you saying that, whenever the Herald states in eir
Report that at some point a Player *did* receive Blots,
descriptively, then he is at that time executing a PO ? Get real.

I'd say we still have the possibility of computing a Game State
without VTs since 3533. That wasn't so long ago. And of course, we
can't really claim we weren't aware of the problem; we were, and we 
tried to simply ignore it; IMHO we're going to get what we deserve.

Well, no. That is what all the debate revolved around the last time 
this was discussed; a Rule that states that something *happens* is 
specifying both the fact and the means, i.e. "having no Mintor" is 
the procedure whereby all units of a Currency are destroyed.

Unless some other Rule were specifically preventing the destruction 
of Currencies *by other Rules* in specific cases, a Rule calling for 
the destruction of all units of a Currency falls under the heading of 
"as specified by the Rules".

No they don't.  It's easy for a Proposal to construct its own continuity
scaffolding.  In this case, the Proposal could start with ``Be it
therefore resolved that a Rule be created with the text "Currency and
Commodity are synonymous.  This Rule repeals itself one second after it
is enacted.".''.

Interesting!  If this is true, then at the least it will be a headache for
the recordkeepors, who'll have to go through all those PO's and figure out
which ones weren't satisfied. Then to execute lots of new PO's for
persistent indebtedness!?

Perhaps it isn't so bad, though.  Only three proposals have passed since
currency reform:

3537 Steve          Disinterested Amendment
   (a one-line amendment)

3538 Steve          Restore Game Balance II
   (if VTs are all zero, it doesn't matter whether this passed)

3543 Harlequin      Pragmatic and *Functional* Currencies
   (fixed up P-Notes and Indulgences to have Mintors, and other fixes).



>Is that a crisis I see coming over the crest of that hill, whistling
>a merry tune? Or do the PC Rules provide a way out of this?

The major question is: can we possibly pass legislation without any VT's in
existence?  If not, we may after all require Rule 1698 to prevent the
destruction of VTs; that would be cancelled and "does not take place". CFJ
933 should then be FALSE!

Judge Elde should take note of all this in eir Judgement!

Here are quotes from the relevant Rules. There is scope here for some
interesting Judging to occur.

====================================================
Rule 955 (Power=3) orders the assessor to count votes which have been
"legally cast".

Rule 206 (Power=2) provides that votes may be cast only by "the casting of
Voting Tokens, as specified in other Rules."

Rule 683 provides that "A Vote is legally cast if it is cast during the
Voting Period of that Proposal, and if that Voting Entity is entitled to
cast a Vote on that particular Proposal."

Rule 1442 requires the "spending" of voting tokens as a condition for such
a vote to be "counted".

Someone suggested intentionally holding a referendum with a negative
voting period, by voting before the referendum is called. If you think
that's possible, let's go for it.

However, I have another suggestion which I'm submitting to you partly
as a solution to the problem at hand, INP 347, but also partly to
learn something about game custom from your responses. So even if you
don't like the idea ar don't care for INP 347, I'd appreciate hearing
from you.

It is obvious that often rule violations occur but have no
consequence. Sometimes this is because the rules don't say anything
about consequences. But sometimes the rules allow a prosecution (like
1439, or infractions which may be reported by some people), and still
nobody bothers to raise the issue (by reporting infractions, making
CFJs etc), and the rule violation is just swept under the rug.

Recently, this practice was even mentioned explicitly as part of the
athmosphere in which Agora is played. And it makes sense, too, because
many rule violations are minor glitches, often connected with
officers' duties (like reporting... when was the last time someone was
penalized for the Infraction of Failure to Report, 1686?). This makes
officers' lives easier and less risky, and is fine with me, especially
as most of these rule violations don't really hurt anyone.

Now Scott's late distribution also doesn't really hurt anyone
seriously, and with the current IN rules that effectively require
unanimous adoption of proposals the only way Scott's glitch may cause
INP 347 to fail is if no other Nomics vote, either, and the proposal
fails with 0 votes cast overall.

But still I wonder what game custom would say about an attempt to cure
the effects of one (unintentional) rule violation with another,
intentional one: Scott has violated the ASAP provision of 1632 (at
least I think he has, but let's assume it for the sake of the
argument), but noone is going to call em on that. So why shouldn't e
violate 1632 again by voting in the name of Agora, anyway, according
to eir taste, or the outcome of an informal straw poll among Agora
players or something? Noone would call em on that rule violation
either, and the bad effect of the first violation would be averted.

So, while I wouldn't mind Scott following my suggestion in this
particular case, my more important question to all players is, how
would you react to em doing so? Would you accept it or cry "foul" and
try to stop or penalize em?

Of course the bigger question, and a possible application of such a
rather harmless precedent, looming in the background is the VT
destruction crisis - we might overcome that with a collective rules
violation, too.

But now there's something new to consider:  whether the destruction of all
VT's wrecks the Proposal system, in contravention of Rule 1698.

That would be better, but I'd rather the whole thing was written
in terms of multiples of MUQs.  (Why shouldn't we be able to tax
for 1.5 VTs?)
<<

The real question is "Why should we want to?" But I'll try to answer
anyway: 

Because in the "algorithm" I proposed for collecting a Robin Hood tax
that would require up to 15 repetitions of the algorithm: making a
payors' list, charging everyone on the list 0.1 VT, repeating the
process. Unwieldy, and I must admit I don't see a real need for
noninteger taxes, anyway[1], except in pathological situations created
just to complicate these things. But as I said earlier, even such
intentional pathologies could, IMHO, not be used for serious scamming,
so they'd be just complicating things for the heck of it. Rather
pointless to provide for such futile manipulations in a first version
of such rules, IMHO.

And I like the idea of defining the tax collection procedure via an
algorithm like the one I suggested, because that makes the results
unambiguous and clear, more so than a handwaving description of the
wanted end result in words, with extra clauses for exceptional
situations and the like.

I admit that details like noninteger tax amounts and weird currencies
like Euclids can be fun; but for the purpose of getting a simple tax
system functional and running they should be ignored. If anyone feels
e wants to extend the tax rules later, after they've been introduced
and tested in the simpler form, e may go ahead, but I'll use my time
for more useful things.

Kolja A.

[1] In fact, I think the whole concept of noninteger MUQs is downright
silly and superfluous. In fact at the moment fractional VTs, and
transfers of such silly amounts of VTs, are just a way to pretend
youre dealing with VTs while you're not.

And, of course, if you really want to have similar effects, you might
just as well redefine VTs to have an MUQ of one, and charge 10 VTs for
one vote. Mathematically speaking you could always define a new
currecy with the same functionality as another, but with integer
MUQ. But as I said, I think that's all quite pointless.

Another suggestion, mostly to the H: Chancellor, to soften the impact
of the upcoming VT crisis, if they indeed disappeared after the PC
reform, after all: You could mint 100 or so new VTs now, and start
circulating those. Then at least slowly the game would start to work
again with VTs whose existence is clear.

Indulgences prevent you from being chucked out of the game.  It's
not a trivial matter to keep yourself Blot free, and what with the
penalties for being in debt, this ensures an interest in having them.
Elde is about to get deregistered for the second time it seems, for

I've often wonders if it would be more sensible to delete the MUQ
concept and replace VTs with "deciVTs" and make "VT" a legislative
synonym for "10 deciVTs."

This is not a TO, it is a descriptive message reporting to all who may
be interested that I've just transferred 3 Koljenkas to the Virus as
an (admittedly small) incentive to tamper around with the curious fact
that at the moment entities that don't even have an executor can still
be the payees of TOs. 

BTW, what happens, if for some weird reason an illegal transfer of
currency to such an entity would take place? Would a PO with that
entity as payor be issued, never to be satisified? The transfer, once
it happened, could never be reversed under the current rules, even if
it occured as the result of a mistake or a deliberate manipulation by
a recordkeepor.

I haven't been around, remember? But, if this were the only Rule,
I might agree with you. But when there exists another Rule stating
"A Currency is destroyed when..." that seems to give a precise Agoran
definition of what it means to be destroyed, I am much less sure.
And I think recent precedent has been to eschew wording that makes
things magically "happen" rather than give responsibility to specific
Players, no? Isn't that the rational behind the currency reform?
Anyway, I think both sides can be argued, so the question is, what
outcome do we want?

As for Game Custom, it did not prevent the emasculation of Kudos
by CFJ, even though they had been used for months. That was also a
situation in which a naive interpretation of the Rules was deemed
insufficient. But like I said, I am a pragmatist. I am more concerned
with results than methods.

But then you only cease to be a tax evader when the CFJ is judged
TRUE; however, judgements on CFJs must be made on the truth
of the statement at the time it was made, not the time it is
judged, and at the time the CFJ is made the person would still be
a tax evader, so such a statement could not legally be judged
TRUE, unless the Rules supplied another way to cease to be a tax
evader.

Good point. Maybe the CFJ that, when judged true, ends the evader
status, should be worded like "The arguments that led to the
conviction of XY in CFJ # as a tax evader do not hold anymore."
Would that work?

Since I was more or less the originator of the MUQ idea (in simple form),
I'll point out that the idea was introduced when various forms
of currency were more scarce, creating some deflation. When we
had Points, for example, it was reasonable to have a Contest entry
fee of 0.5 Points. Now, when Currencies have some function, I'm
not so sure.

A recipe for dictatorship? Not to mention the problem of deciding

"Mark gains 3 Blots" is not a statement that a Player *did* receive
Blots, but a statement that a Player *does* receive Blots.  Had the
sentence read "Mark gained 3 Blots", or "Mark should receive 3 Blots",
or "Mark has done X, the penalty for which is 3 Blots" without actually
saying that e receives that penalty, then your point would hold up.

IMO the most natural reading of "Mark gains 3 Blots", when spoken by
someone with authority to do this, is "Mark hereby becomes payor of
<1 new PO for 3 Indulgences / 3 new POs for 1 Indulgence each>, the
payee of which is the Bank".

No, that won't do.  As someone has pointed out, the Bank can create VTs,
which then will eventually get paid out as salaries.  As soon as some
Player possesses a single VT, then a Proposal can be passed within 10 days.

Back to scenario #1: If CFJ 933 is TRUE, then Proposals 3537, 3538, and
3543 are lost after all, and the Recordkeepor for VTs has some work to do.

They pass all practical test, of course - e.g. it is believed (though not
yet proved) that Pi is a normal number, i.e. that all digits have the same
frequency in any base.

What they fail is the requirement of complete unpredictability: Pi is,
after all, explicitly computable to any desired accuracy, given enough
computer time and memory.

You mean, it took less than 10 pages to write and thus couldn't possibly
be effective. Besides, it was an attempt to introduce some middle ages

>Me too.  That (Oerjan's) is what I've always taken it to mean.

Here is one of the meanings listed in my Webster's:

    "to remove and put another in the place of"

What is the current P-Note Report?  The one dated 9/15/97.  After I publish the
next P-Note Report on Monday, 9/22/97, the 9/15 report will be replaced by the
9/22 report as the current report.  In this one sense, the 9/15 report is being
superseded.  True, there are other meanings listed and other game state
properties wrt these reports in which one does not supersede the other.  The
Rules do not specify which sense or meaning of "supersede" we are to use.  I
would take this to mean that *any* sense in which it is superseded counts as
being superseded wrt the ratification Rules.  However, it certainly makes my
life easier to ignore this meaning.  Anyone  remember offhand what date
Harlequin's ratification proposal passed?

Does the term "clear as ink" exist in English?

The second sentence needs rewording. With the above a new Payment Order
could arise each time someone refers to the original report, or just notes
without Authority that someone receives Blots.

I would most certainly cry "foul". I don't accept intentional breaks of
the Rules - it goes against the fundamental spirit of the game, as
embodied in Rule 101.

We have never introduced a true contract law; only half-assed attempts
at it.  The reason contract law has never succeeded is that all the
attempts to introduce it have been stillborn.  The concept is sound;
the execution, so far, has not been.

That would be an error in recordkeeping, correctable through the

No, the problem with Oaths is that they got tied up in
self-interference and Rule-interference in a naively-construed
manner.  As long as contracts are viewed as being subject to the same
precedence concepts as the Rules, they will be nonfunctional.

That aside, the modern US system is very much similar to a
"middle-ages" feel; US contract and tort law are fundamentally very
similar to their British counterparts, and neither has changed all
that much for hundreds of years.

No, it's not.  The 9/22 report in no way removes or replaces the 9/15
report, because it reports on completely different things.  This is
like stating that the 9/16 issue of the New York Times supersedes the
9/15 issue of the New York Times.  It might "supersede" it at the

I tend to agree with Oerjan here.  Ignoring unintentional, insignificant violations is one thing (when the Rules allow you to ignore it), deliberately breaking the rules should not be sanctioned.

I would most certainly cry "foul". I don't accept intentional breaks of
the Rules - it goes against the fundamental spirit of the game, as
embodied in Rule 101.

You deny my argument and then support it in the same paragraph.  8)
Even though you put quotes around "supersede", there is one sense in which it
is true, in the sense of what is being currently sold.  Old versions are
removed from the newstand and replaced with new versions.  Old reports are
removed from the position of being current and replaced with new reports.  It's
fine with me if everyone wants to say, this is not the meaning of supersede
that we want to use in this case.  But absent specific directions from the
Rules, how do you justify ignoring this valid meaning?

Because I think there is another, perfectly valid, meaning of
"supersede" that makes more sense in this context.  And, apparently, I
have substantial support on this issue; four other Players have
expressed concurrence with me on it.

You're assuming it will pass.  Maybe it will.  But I know I won't
vote for it as long as it does things in terms of integer amounts
rather than integral multiples of the MUQ.

That's a problem with your system, and not with MUQs.  If for
some reason we flood the market with VTs, the problem still exists
if we decide we want to create a tax of 5000 VTs, even if we're doing
it in integer amounts.

So find a system that requires less paperwork.

If there's a simple solution I do.

Funny, I was just going to say that a later report does not supersede
an earlier one unless it corrects an error in the earlier one.
If the Assessor publishes a VT Report of Aug. 15, and then one
of Aug.25 (which does not allege any error in the Aug. 15 report),
then the Aug. 15 report does still accurately (assuming there *was*
no error) report the VT holdings on Aug. 15--thus, it has not
been superseded.

It does, but not by an appeal of CFJ 940.  CFJ 940 doesn't realy
fully address the issue we are trying to resolve.

I think the problem here is that the word 'superseded' does not just 
refer to an object, but to an object in a specific context. In other 
words, in your example, the Aug. 15 report has been superseded in its 
context as 'the current report,' but not in its context as 'the report of 
how things were on Aug. 15.' The same is true of newspapers -- each paper 
retains its context as 'the paper of <day x>', but loses its context of 
'the current paper.'

Based on the language of R1552, I'm inclined to think that the implied 
context here is the permanent one, i.e. a document is not superseded for 
the purposes of this rule by publication of another document containing 
the same type of information. On the other hand, in the absence of a CFJ 
settling this matter an argument can be made that Crito can use his own 
judgement about the context.

I think I'll just start appealing everything.  That way we won't miss

Good answer.  8)  In rereading the rule, I notice it says "...the information
has not been superseded..." rather than "the document...", in which case I have
to agree, the stricter meaning of supersede makes more sense here.  So I'd
better dig up that date of the PC fix proposal and note it in my two reports.

I have been convinced that the permanent context is the correct one too,
because the rule states that the *information* should not be superseded.  I had
originally thought it said "document", but that is in a subsequent paragraph
that talks explicitly about the later document correcting errors in the former.
 So I guess that settles that.  8)

Some people here have been debating whether a Payment Order has to be
phrased as an actual command to take effect, or whether it can be
implicit.

I note from browsing the Rules that there might be a similar question
about Transfer Orders...

Greetings,
rjan.

DIS: Payment vs Transfer Orders

IIRC, the ability to create implicit Transfer Orders is made explicit in the Rules.  8)

Some people here have been debating whether a Payment Order has to be
phrased as an actual command to take effect, or whether it can be
implicit.

I note from browsing the Rules that there might be a similar question
about Transfer Orders...

Greetings,

True...

Rule 1677/3 (Power=1)
Currency Awards for New Players

      Upon the start of a Player's Grace Period, the Registrar shall
      pay out to that Player an award of 5 Voting Tokens.

Ah, thanks.

(Of course Players are only Mintors of their own currencies; the Bank is
the Mintor for the currencies we're interested in.  But I now understand
what was intended.)

Alas, TOs may only be implicit when required to be so:

      The Rules, and only the Rules, may specify that certain actions,
      such as Voting, are also implicitly the submission of one or
      more Transfer Orders, as long as the action which is implicitly

Why do you think CFJ 940 was judged incorrectly?  It seems to
me that nothing in your R&A conflicts with the judgement of CFJ 940.

Well,  it depends whether you believe that

"Blob commits the Infraction of Failing to Judge, an action which bears
 the penalty of 3 Blots"

"explicitly and unambiguously state[s] that the purported Payor is 
ordered to effect a payment as a consequence of that message."

I had to consider similar issues in my judgement, but not this specific 
one. If the general consensus is that the above statement *does* qualify 
under CFJ 940, then I have no problem with CFJ 940; if not, I disagree.

I think part of the problem is that CFJ 940, for all its attempts at 
examples and clarity, remains a bit ambiguous as to what qualifies; or, 
if it does not, then it is too limiting in casting its net of 
acceptability.

And if you wanted to collect a tax of 15 VTs, it would take 15
repititions even under your system.  The solution is to find
a better algorithm, not to fix one flaw with a second.

Again, if there were some great difficulty in implementing non-integer
taxes which was not present in integer taxes, I would agree with you.
I do not see any such difficulty.

Um, non-integer VTs are silly, but multiplying everything by 10
would be pointless?  Sounds like what you really want to do is
raise the VT MUQ back to 1.  You're welcome to try.

Interesting. What makes you think that when the Rules use a term 
which has more than one meaning, any situation happening to fulfill 
the Rule's criteria under one of these meanings will trigger that 
Rule's provisions ?

I myself am of the opinion that the word 'superseded' as used in the 
Rules can only mean one thing; it's what that one thing is that I'm 
not sure about.

"The Mintor, of all Players"... Or, "among all Players, only the
Mintor". But actually that should have been "of all non-Rule
Entities, only the Mintor" etc.; the point being that a Rule, like a
300-pound gorilla, pretty much destroys Currencies whenever it wants
to (unless some other 300-pound gorilla, er, Rule, prevents it from
so doing), it's only _non-Rules_ that the provision in 852 covers.

If anyone wants to appeal 933, don't go to that trouble and just ask 
me to, I'll be perfectly happy to have Elde appeal eir own Judgement 
if that makes the process faster.

Besides its popularity (after all, it may go out of fashion tomorrow)
this interpretation is IMHO supported by the fact that the
Ratification process works in exactly the same manner whether a
subsequent Report has been published after the Report that is
Ratified, or not.

As one of the people who strongly supported dropping the VT MUQ to 0.1,
let me say I *am* sure.  If I wish to offer a service worth, IMO,
less than 1 VT (say about 0.2 VT), what am I supposed to do if
the MUQ is 1?  Either give it away for free (well, then, I guess
I won't offer it at all) or charge 1VT for it (in which case
perhaps no one will use it)?  We should keep 0.1 MUQ for VTs
for the same reason we keep non-integral amounts of U.S. dollars:
1 VT, and $1, are too coarse amounts to set a fair market price
for some items.

Well, then, why not multiply everything by 10?  First, because
there's nothing wrong with the current system (I must confess
I utterly fail to understand the aversion to fractions that several
Players seem to have).  Second, if we later decide P-Notes need
to be divided more finely, it's a lot easier to say "the MUQ
of P-Notes is 0.1" then going through the Rules and multiplying
all P-Note amounts by 10.

In my delayed & unofficial R&A on CFJ 940, I noted that I deliberately
left that question unanswered.

I quite agree with that.

I'm sorry; when I was writing my judgement I didn't remember that

There is a fine line, however, between breaking the Rules and
overlooking a legal fiction. I think this case falls into the
latter category. My opinion, of course.

What makes you think it won't, as long as there is no reason to choose one
meaning over another and the meanings provide supplemental rather than
conflicting criteria?  In this particular case, I concede that the majority's
preferred meaning is the one that best fits the wording of the rule.

I think this is a wholly separate issue, however, from the idea of
Orders which are not themselves implicit, but for which some of the
required elements are specified implicitly.  Is "I transfer 2 VTs to
Steve" a Transfer Order?  The source entity is not specified
explicitly, but it's pretty clear to me what the source entity is.
