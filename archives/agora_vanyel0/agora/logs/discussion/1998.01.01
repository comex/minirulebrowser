General Chaos's recent amendment did not remove the phrase: 
  "Payment Order from the Bank to one Player in VTs"
from R1661, so that Patronage would appear to still need be in VTs.  

Otherwise I would have probably had Scott receive an Indulgence.

Rule 879 was recently amended, as many of you are no doubt aware.  I
am not clear as to which definition of Quorum should apply to
Proposals whose Voting Periods were in progress at the time that Rule
879 was amended.  Should the Quorum for those Proposals be calculated
by the Rules in force when the Proposal's Voting Period began, or that
in force when it ended?

Hey, it's not my argument. I'm only the Judge.

Actually, the procedure in R402 need not be followed. I quote from
that Rule:

      If another Rule specifies that the Speaker-Elect becomes
      Speaker before the completion of step 3, such as the case when
      the Rules require an immediate Speaker transition, then this
      Rule defers to it, and the procedure above need not be
      completed.

And now note R1581:

Rule 1581/2 (Power=1)
Quarterly Speaker Change

      Upon the commencement of each new quarter, the Player who holds
      the Office of Speaker-Elect immediately becomes Speaker, and the
      old  Speaker ceases to be Speaker.

I would say that Morendil became Speaker at midnight GMT Jan 01, 1998.

Morendil did retract both of those votes.

As far as I know, the recent amendment to R879 did not remove from
it the following paragraph:

      Quorum for a Proposal is calculated using the number of
      Registered Players, and their Hold statuses (On or Off), at the
      beginning of the prescribed Voting Period for that Proposal.

Of course, that doesn't settle your question: which calculating
method to use? I would say that you should use the new Quorum
equation, applied to the situation as it was when the VPs began.
Although the Promotor and the Assessor do make Quorum calculations
prior to the ends of the VPs for Proposals, I regard these
calculations as purely advisory. The only calculation of legal
significance is the one made at the end of the VP in order to
determine whether enough votes have been cast on a Proposal to
ensure that Quorum is met. You should therefore use the Rules
as they are at the end of the VP.

Morendil retracted these votes shortly before the end of the Voting Period
for P3640.

Yes, I have since discovered that, as my recent reports have
indicated.

I note that I disapprove of this.  There should be some Player action
that accompanies a change of Speaker.  Imagine the chaos that could be
engendered by uncertainty in the identity of the Speaker.  IMO, the
Speaker should never change without a two-way handshake between the
old and new Speaker; in the case that the old Speaker is not
accessible, some other Player can be designated by an appropriate
official to stand in eir stead.

That's the conclusion I came to as well, and what I used in reporting
the results on the most recent batch.
