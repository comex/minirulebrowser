Say I make a Proposal that you don't like, enough to spend P-Notes
reducing its Priority. As soon as you reduce the Proposal's Priority
below zero, then I can raise its Priority back to zero immediately
without any P-Note expenditure, by the simple expedient of withdrawing
the Proposal from the Queue and resubmitting it to the Promotor. 
<<

Of course you can. But then you change the date when the proposal was
submitted, to a later time. And this date is the tiebreaker between
proposals with equal priority, so withdrawing and resubmitting does
lower the position of the proposal in the queue, and usually more so
than just raising its priority back to zero.

Ok, so pushing a proposal's priority to -3 or so may be useless. But
at least if negative priorities are possible I can spend one P-note to
lower a proposal's priority without worryong that the act may be
futile, because the priority is already zero.

Yes and no. There are no explicit rounding rules anywhere. But both

While I have no problem with the idea generally, it might be nice to
give a pro-rata salary to persons who hold the office for less than a
month.  A month is quite a long time, after all.

... In a dimly lit hall, the Priests of the Order are standing in a
circle around their High Priest. They are chanting magical words, and
the High Priest is holding a Cloak of Forgetfulness over a portrait of
the Assessor. Just as the spell is about to clear the mind of the
Assessor of all memories of POs with the Order as payor, a business
like voice can be heard, transmitted into the Order's dungeons by
unseen telepathic means, and asking innocently:

>>
Did Assessor Blob ever issue a PO ordering the OEE to pay 2 VTs for the
votes they cast against P3791?
<<

With a ghastly shreek the High Priest drops the Cloak which dissolves
into dust before it touches the ground. Pink flashes dance around the
Assessor's portrait, and the Priests slump to the ground
exhausted. The spell is broken.

Slowly recovering their energies, the Priests gather round again half
an hour later, this time around a portrait of Steve. With trembling
hands the High Priest unfolds a Cloak of Revengeful Curses...

Lessee, what is so difficult about all this then?

My pet peeves if you will.

Vagueness.  

Reassignment of PO#s with no table to tell me which the original
officer given numbers were.  While it is useful for the Accountor to
issue eir own numbers, it is maddening to match up these POs.  

Players who don't bring a problem to my attention as soon as possible. 
Steve is least guilty of this, he points out most errors he sees very
promptly.  There were some errors in my first report that went
unreported until the last report i did.  6 revisions these errors made
it through and then got reported!

Players who have a nice column format going for say, Officers salaries,
and then break the column format for a few orders and then resume
another format for say the unemployment orders. If the entire message
were in one  column format it would be at least one third less the
work.  I can manipulate columned text  in a text processor and cut and
paste it into a spreadsheet.  by changing formats. i have to do this
twice and then extract the middle orders by hand.  

Officers who don't use the column format at all.

Players who think they paid something and did not, or think someone
else did so and they did not.

People who bury a TO in a bunch of text.  

When it is unclear if the officer or executor is ordering the Bank to
pay, or paying something as a Player.  Some of the first patronage POs
i dealt with were vague.

And things that make me smile and wish pleasantness at Players.

When a Player quotes the PO they are paying. if they include the time
stamp or the message id even better.  I love this.  It makes it easy to
match it up with no errors.

Players who use a consistent column layout even for one TO.

Players who put the word hereby in the message.  Easy to search for.  
Transfer is in too many headers to be useful.  

Players who put TO or PO in the subject.  I especially love the subject
"Voting TO".

Officers who use concise unique identifiers for the PO's  aaa234 may
not mean as much as RVTPO234, but it is shorter on my report.  I do
appreciate that there are unique identifiers even if they are long.  i
can do a search for aaa and know that i will get TOs and POs.

Things i hate but are my own doing or no one elses fault.

Calculating the Credits and Debits  I know there must be an easier way.
 I will find it.

Missing a failed TO.  This is a nightmare to retrace.

I accidentally deleted one of my reports, and only had the email copy. 
It was a pain to remake it. I still think it is not quite right.

Vacated POs.

Long and short Player names.   lee and Antimatter are both a pain when
i format the report.

I don't like this. This means that in any month in which an Office
changes hands after the 10th and before the 21st of the month, (and this
will include any Office for which a new Officer has been Elected by
Referendum at the end of a Term of Service, for such an Election takes
at least two weeks from the 1st of the month) no Officer will receive
any Salary, even if both the outgoing and incoming Officers have been
scrupulous in performing their duties. That isn't fair.

Meanwhile, in a beautifully lit and stylishly appointed penthouse
apartment, Steve is idly fingering a coin. On one face are embossed the
aquiline features of the Order's High Priest, Kolja, and on the other,
the dark and flashing looks of the Notary Murphy. It is hard to decide
whom to vote for in the Notary Election, for he has, as yet, no reason
to favour one Candidate over the other...

Well, strictly speaking all Priorities less than zero will be equivalent
in their effects, since the effect of withdrawing a Proposal and
resubmitting it is exactly the same whether the Priority is -1 or -100.
So no-one could have any possible reason to lower Priority beyond -1.
You're right of course that resubmission will mean a later date and
hence lower Priority in that sense.
