Why not just destroy them, Harlequin? Then you'd stop getting these
annoying requests from Trustees.

Personally, I've never understood why people have wanted to build in
the ability for players to mint their own Currencies as a feature of
the Currency system. Over the many years that we've had this feature
in play, there have been repeated attempts by different Players to
get personally minted Currencies to work, and all have pretty much
been abject failures. The reasons are not hard to see. Personally
minted Currencies are a pure medium of exchange, and our experience
has shown us that we aren't big and complex enough to need pure media
of exchange. We don't have enough different goods (we have three). On
the scales we operate on, we can get by handily with forms of barter,
which is what I take the system we have now with VTs, P-Notes and
Indulgences to be. Similar remarks, with a few reservations, apply to
Croup Coins.

I wonder what it would take to excise this feature from the Ruleset?

Amazingly, the answer appears to be just this:

####
Proto-Proposal
Remove Mint Authority from Players

Be it hereby resolved that R1579 (Mintors) be amended by deleting
from it the text which reads:

      All Players have Mint Authority.

####

Worth doing? What do people think?

####
Proto-Proposal
No Presence

[Comment: the other idea I've had to increase VT expenditure, apart
from secret voting, is the regularly raised idea of getting rid of
Presence. In conjunction with secret voting, this might be especially
effective, since secret voting would make the tactic of not voting on
a Proposal you dislike much more dangerous. As with my other Proposals
in this area, what I propose is a two month trial.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 1715 (Announcing One's Presence) be
amendeed by appending to it a paragraph which reads:

      This Rule, apart from this paragraph, has no effect. Two
      months after this paragraph is added to this Rule, this
      paragraph shall be deleted from this Rule.

Darn!  I'm going to deregister within a week or so, and I was hoping
to do so without leaving any Probate.  This is going to make me have
assets after I deregister.  Any ideas to get around this?

DIS: Re: BUS: Jester's Probate

I wouldn't worry about it.  It's the outstanding POs that are a pain.  If you
don't have any of those, then a few extra assets won't make any difference. 
Besides, you can always deregister before next Friday and avoid this anyway. 
Although, I must say, I'll be sorry to see us lose another Player so soon.   I
hope you will be able rejoin us soon.
