It was not.  I note that two other Proposals also had Priority 2, both
of which were proposed less recently than your Proposal, so your
Proposal should not have been distributed.

I did notice, it didn't make it in. In fact, quite a large number of 
Priority changes have happened since Monday. I spent quite some time 
revising the Queue before distributing.

There are now three proposals left in the Queue with Priority 2. All
three of these will be distributed next week, unless anybody changes
things around.

As there are people out there who are suffering from a lack of P-Notes,
and since I have this nice Promotor's Privilege which I haven't really
been putting to much use, I offer the following deal.

For 1 P-Note I will use my Privilege over two consecutive weeks to raise
the Priority of any Proposal by two, or any two proposals by one. First
come, first served. Two for the price of one. It's a win-win situation.
Any takers?
