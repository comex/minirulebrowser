Did I say that you were? Nevertheless, such inconsistencies, when they
occur, are worthy of note, I think even you will agree. I cannot see
that it is in any way "bordering on the dishonourable" to comment on
them.

Protoproposal Chaos46 [rev. 2]

Appeal Tweaks

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1570 be amended to read:

      (a) As soon as possible after an Application for Appeal of a 
          Judgement or Motion has been executed, the Clerk of the
          Court shall:
          (1) assign, according to the procedures defined elsewhere,
              three Players to serve as the Board of Appeal for that
              Appeal; and 
          (2) publish a Notice of Appeal identifying the Judgement or
              Motion being Appealed, and the identity of the three
              Players selected under subparagraph (1) above.

      (b) The Clerk of the Courts shall develop and utilize a system
          of numbering or otherwise identifying Calls for Appeals such
          that Players may readily and unambiguously refer to any
          individual Appeal without undue difficulty or confusion.

      (c) If the Clerk of the Courts is in doubt as to whether an
          Application for Appeal has been successfully executed, e
          shall proceed as if it had been successfully executed,
          reserving the question of successful execution to the Board
          of Appeals.

      (d) If the Board of Appeals finds that the Application for
|         Appeal which led to the appointment of that Board was not
|         successfully executed, it may (at its discretion) dismiss
|         the Appeal, without making any ruling on the merits of the
|         Appeal.  A dismissal of this nature is without prejudice.

Of course you are right. How did I miss that? I guess I didn't really
read the rule. Sorry.

Here's what R1863 actually says:

      Effective control of an asset (eg. a unit of Currency) is the
      ability to dispose of that asset as one wishes. The Assessor is
      empowered to make determinations as to whether a Player has
      effective control over a particular asset at a particular time.
      Such determinations are defeasible and may be overturned by the
      Courts.

As Assessor, you therefore have a lot of latitude (subject to
confirmation by the Courts) in determining whether a Players has
effective control of an asset. In the case of a Player who has some VTs,
but even more debts, I'd say that you would be within the rights granted
you by this Rule to judge that the Player is under enough pressure to
repay debts before making any further expenditure so that he might not
count as retaining effective control of eir assets. On the other hand,
one could argue that the Player has a choice about how to spend eir VTs:
pay for votes or repay debts already incurred, so the Player does retain
effective control of the asset, since e can still decide how to dispose
of it. It is, at least initially, up to you.

If the definition of "defeasible" in Black's is accurate, this is at
least an atypical usage of the word.  "Defeasible", as provided by
Black's, means "subject to be defeated, annulled, revoked, or undone
upon the happening of a future event or the performance of a condition
subsequent, or by a conditional limitation."  While a subsequent
judicial finding of error is strictly a "future event", I think the
term "reversible" would be less confusing, especially since I prefer
to think of the exercise of judicial process as one of discovery,
rather than one of performance.  (The typical legal use of
"defeasible" relates to an interest in property which can be defeated
by a second party's performance, such as paying off a mortgage.  The
instant use instead applies it to the result of a quasi-judicial
finding, which is not of the same breed as a grant of right.)

I'm not interested in the typical legal usage of "defeasible", nor can I
see any reason why I should be. I don't think that anyone who wasn't
utterly mesmerised by Black's would find my use of the word confusing.
Black's is not a Holy Book, you know. It gives the meanings of technical
legal terms as they are used in the English legal system and those
derived from it. The use of those terms in those ways in those legal
systems is a completely contingent and arbitrary matter, reflecting the
particular historical developments of those legal systems. They do not
in any way represent a standard to which we should aspire. (What does
Black's have to say about that bête noir of American Constitutional law,
"substantive due process"? Would you argue that if that phrase appeared
somewhere in the Ruleset, that it ought to be interpreted according to
whatever definition of it is given in Black's?) It makes no sense to ask
if the use of a word in Agora is "accurate" according to Black's. Agora
is distinct legal system with its own traditions and history, and its
own ways of introducing and employing technical terms, of which the use
of "defeasible" in R1863 is a typical example, although the use of
"effective control" in the same Rule is probably a better one. Is
"effective control" defined in Black's, too? I don't care if it is. My
intention in introducing such a vaguely defined term, along with a
procedure for precisifying it over time as circumstances demand, was to
allow a distinctively Agoran usage to grow up around the term, not to
import lock, stock and barrel a completely irrelevant usage grown up in
a completely different, and irrelevant, legal environment. Put your copy
of Black's away, Scott, and save it for your law studies. You won't need
it here.

I looked up the term because I had never seen it before.  While it is
true that Black's is a standard that seeks to define the use of
English (as well as Latin, French, Gaelic, and several other
languages) as it is used in American (and, to the extent that American
law derives from English, English) law, it should be noted that there
are a great many words in the English language whose meaning is
largely derived from their legal use.  I would hold that "defeasible"
is one such word.  The definition given by the Oxford English
Dictionary, which I suspect most of us here would grant is an
acceptable authority on the English language, also suggests that your
use of the word is inappropriate.  (The sole definition given by the
OED is of a legal nature, largely in concordance with that given in
Black's.)  Would your response been similar had I made my argument
against this choice of word based on the OED's definition, instead of
Black's?

I continue to contend that your usage represents an abuse of the
language; I see no reason to take perfectly good words and misapply
them.  Claiming such conduct as the creation of "a distinctly Agoran
usage" is, to my mind, no defense to such conduct.  Doing so serves
only obfuscate and confuse.  

Any legal standard that may arise from this Rule will not arise from
judicial construction of the word "defeasible"; it will arise from
construction of the phrase "effective control of an asset".  Frankly,
your claim that your use was intended to create a distinct Agoran
usage for the term "defeasible" is practically void on its face, and I
am surprised that you have attempted to make it.  Further, the fact
that this language appears in yet another of your interminable
"temporary experiments" is also harmful to your position.  It seems
quite clear to me that you are simply unwilling to admit that your
choice of "defeasible" was poor, and that there are other words
(whether or not appearing in Black's) that would serve better.

At the moment there are few struggles over priority that involve
decreasing priority. This is partly because we believe that priorities
can't be negative, and becasue the proposal queue is only published
very shortly before the next batch of proposals is distributed, so if
there is a proposal I strongly dislike, with priority zero, I can do
nothing to move it back in the queue, while a supporter can raise
easily raise its priority.

I'd like to allow negative priorities, so I can drive proposals I
don't like down the queue. But I'm not sure how to do it. R1036 says
the priority must be 'integer', and it seems to me we interpret that
as "a whole, positive number or zero". Could we say "A Proposal's
Priority is an integer value. It may be negative." to allow all
priority values like ..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 etc? Or could you argue
that this is already the meaning of "integer" in R1036, considering
that -3 is an integer number in mathematical language (as opposed to,
say, rational numbers like 3/4 or irrational numbers like pi, and the
positive integers which are called 'natural' numbers IIRC), and using
R1600?

Please let me know whether a) you'd like to allow negative priorites
and b) you have an idea how to define them propoerly.

DIS: Negative priorities

I would not oppose negative priorities.  In standard mathematical terminology,
"integer" includes negative numbers, and R1600 specifies that Agora uses such
meanings for mathematical terms, so, yes, you don't have to make any fancy
definition in the Rules, just remove the lower limit of zero.

Taxes may lead to tax amounts that are not integer multiples of the
MUQ of the taxed currency. The tax rule R1853 then requires the levier of
the tax to issue payment orders for, say, 1.6 indulgences, while the
PO rule R1596. I guess we'll need a rounding clause in the tax rule,
like 

      the amount of the levy, expressed as a percentage of holdings of
      that Currency, not in excess of fifty percent, and rounded off
                                                     ***************
      to the nearest multiple of the Currency's MUQ, which each

      entity in possession of that Currency will be required to pay

Should we quickly push through an emergency proposal to this effect,
or should we let the indulgence tax of P3794 run into this problem
straight on?  If we do the latter, then what POs will have to be
issued for this tax and why?

DIS: Tax problem

When I was Accountor and had to levy taxes, I always assumed that standard
methods of rounding Currencies should be used in calculating tax assessments.
And that is what I did.  So we have some (weak) game custom for this, without
having to rely on emergency legislation.  It seems reasonable to me that MUQ
rules can be considered to work in conjunction with tax rules to force such
rounding, without having to specify it explicitly.  But others may disagree.

Allow negative priorities


Amend R1771 by removing the sentence "The Priority of a Proposal may
not be reduced below zero in this manner."


Amend R1773 by removing the second paragraph.


Amend R1774 by replacing the string "zero Priority" with "zero or
negative Priority".

Is this ok? Would you support it if it was appended to another
proposal you support?

There is nothing in R.1036 as I read it that requires that a
Proposal's Priority be nonnegative.  However, R.1771 clearly prohibits
anyone from using its mechanism to lower a Proposal's Priority below
zero, and this is why you are barred from satisfying your desire.

"Integer", to me, quite clearly includes the negative integers.  If
you want nonnegative, you have to qualify "integer" with "nonnegative"
or use the term "natural number".

R.1577 is at least a persuasive suggestion of the permissibility of

Allow negative priorities


Amend R1771 by removing the sentence "The Priority of a Proposal may
not be reduced below zero in this manner."


Amend R1773 by removing the second paragraph.


Amend R1774 by replacing the string "zero Priority" with "zero or
negative Priority".

Is this ok? Would you support it if it was appended to another
proposal you support?

Together with the (as yet unchallenged) game custom established by
Crito with the first VT tax, I guess that's correct. Although R1577
really only refers to currency _transfers_ and _holdings_, not to POs
or taxes.

Yes, interesting situation, innit?

You can either admit that the rules are inconsistent here. In that
case we're stuck until a solution (like Scott's proto) is adopted. 

Or you try to construct a reading of the rules that leads to some
solution. Such a construction would be based on the assumption that
the rules can't really be inconsistent, so if they look as if they
are, we're just not looking hard enough. 

For example, you may start from Steve's above summary of the
situation, and then go on to say that the rules obviously can't
require the impossible, so the explicit rules must be completed by the
implicit permission to equate "execute a PO for 0 VTs" with "do
nothing". This is not based on any rule's wording, but it may be seen
as an implicit prescription of the rules that restores consistency. 

In addition, this is what we've been doing for quite some time now
concerning voting entities that elected not to vote on a given
proposal (although I vaguely remember this point being addresses some
time ago). So there is some game custom, to back it up.

If this is so, do we really _need_ a proposal like Scott's, or would
this just nicely clarify the existing situation?

That's why I said it was only persuasive authority of permissibility.
I wouldn't say that rounding is required.  A smart-ass Recordkeepor
could easily execute possibly unsatisfiable Orders by not rounding.

(I'm working on rewriting most of the currency stuff to deal with a
number of these little problems.  Mostly working on improving error
case handing.)

This seems quite reasonable to me, and I would not Judge contrary to
it if asked.

The latter, I should think.  Nonetheless, clarity is often a good
thing.  There are times when questions should be left to a Judge to

I don't agree.  IMO, R1036 does not prohibit priorities from
being negative.  That is accomplished by R1771 and R1773.
These two Rules specify the only two ways we currently have
of reducing priorities.  R1771 specifically prohibits a
priority from being made negative by the method described
in that Rule, i.e., the payment of P-Notes.  R1773 says, more
generally, that if a priority becomes negative it is reset
to zero.

Not only could I argue that, I would argue that.  If you want
to allow priorities to be negative, (and I certainly like
the idea), you need to amend R1771 and R1773; you can leave
R1036 alone.

No, of course not. I have never argued that definitions from the
dictionary are irrelevant to Agoran usage. My response in that case
would probably have been to say that while "defeasible" may not have
been absolutely the best word I could have chosen, it is clear enough in
its context not to be confusing. Of course, if others feel that it is
confusing, and want to replace "defeasible" with "reversible", they'll
get no opposition from me, although personally I wouldn't waste a VT on
such a trivial proposal.

Reread my post. The claim about attempting to create a distinct Agoran
usage was made only for "effective control" and not for "defeasible".
About "defeasible" I say only that the fact that the word has a
definition in Black's is completely irrelevant to its proper usage in
Agora. The fact that the word has a similar definition in the OED is not
irrelevant, though, as I concede above. The thrust of my argument
stands: put away the Black's; you won't need it here. A good dictionary
will be sufficient.

With all the discussion about exactly what amendments are necessary to
make negative Priorities possible, nobody seems to have noticed that
there is no point in reducing the Priority of any Proposal below zero.
Say I make a Proposal that you don't like, enough to spend P-Notes
reducing its Priority. As soon as you reduce the Proposal's Priority
below zero, then I can raise its Priority back to zero immediately
without any P-Note expenditure, by the simple expedient of withdrawing
the Proposal from the Queue and resubmitting it to the Promotor.
