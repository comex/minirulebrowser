I don't see the problem.  It would only be a problem if A and B were
similarily situated, which I think is clearly presumed to not be the
case.  Also, I don't see intent as necessarily being an element of the 
rule suggested by Vlad.

I guess I don't understand what Vlad's clause is supposed to do, then.
Could you or Vlad give an example?

Plainness is a Virtue

Be it resolved, that Rule 1023 be amended to read:

      (a) Any Player who fails to perform, in a timely manner, an
          action required of em by the Rules is guilty of Tardiness, a
          Class D Crime.

      (b) The definition of "a timely manner" shall be at the sound
          discretion of the Judge assigned to judge a CFJ alleging
          this crime, but shall in no case include:
        (1) intentional failures to perform; nor
        (2) intentional and excessive delays in performance.

      (c) Generally, performance within one week's time will be timely
          unless the Rules suggest otherwise.  The performance of
          actions in an order other than that in which the duties to
          perform them were incurred may be used as evidence of
          untimely performance, but is not proof thereof.

      (d) This Rule in no way modifies any requirement imposed by
          other Rules to perform specific acts within a specific time
          or in a specific order.

Protoproposal Chaos44 [rev. 9]

Oh, what a tangled web....

Be it resolved, that Rule 478 be amended to read:

      (a) A Public Forum is any medium of communication so designated
          as such by the Registrar.

      (b) The Registrar may designate any medium as a Public Forum, or
          revoke such designation from a medium already so designated,
          Without Objection.  However, the message which is to
          effectuate the change intended must be sent via a medium
          which is a Public Forum both before and after the
          designation or revocation, in order to have legal effect.

      (c) The Registrar may designate any medium (other than one which
          is designated as a Public Forum) as a Discussion Forum,
          Without Objection, and may revoke such designation in the
          same manner.  The designation of a medium as a Public Forum
          automatically revokes any designation of that same medium as
          a Discussion Forum.

      (d) Every Active Player shall ensure that e is able to receive
          messages sent to every medium which the Registrar has
          designated as a Public Forum.  However, the temporary
          inability of a Player to receive a Public Forum does not
          deprive that medium of its status as a Public Forum.

      (e) Any message conveyed by one or more Public Fora is deemed to
          have been sent to the Public Forum.  In addition, any
          message sent, by any medium or combination of media, other
          than a medium designated as a Discussion Forum, to every
          Active Player so that each Active Player is reasonably
          certain to receive it, is deemed to have been sent to the
          Public Forum, but only if it bears an explicit indication
          that it is intended to be a Public Forum message.

      (f) Whenever the Rules require a Player to "announce", "post",
          or "distribute" some communication or notification, that
          Player shall do so by sending it to the Public Forum, unless
          the Rules specify otherwise in that instance.

      (g) When the Rules require that a message be sent directly to a
          Player, or make a legal effect contingent on sending a
          message to a Player, the use of a Discussion Forum to send
          such a message shall not be effective unless the receiving
          Player explicitly or implicitly confirms having received
          that message.

It adds a limited amount of leeway for the Judge's interpretation. To
take the recent CFJ I judged, rather than wrestling with the Platonic
meaning of "I call for the Impeachment of Chancellor Andre", I can
simply consider what a reasonable person would take that to mean.
If I decided that a reasonable person could find that statement to
be ambiguous, then I would give G. Chaos the benefit of the doubt
(presumably, in this case, Judging that no referendum was called). 
In the case of my own voting CFJ, the Judge would have to decide
whether there was reasonable doubt as to the nature of my actions
(i.e. what it was I really did). If he decided there was, then again
I would receive the benefit of the doubt (the votes would be
cancelled, in my case). If he decided there wasn't reasonable doubt,
then I would lose the case. As G. Chaos pointed, out, intent doesn't
come into it at all.
  Of course, it can also be unclear which Judgment would more benefit
the Player concerned, but if there is reasonable doubt, then it 
doesn't matter much what the decision is. If you're worried about
precedent, it'd be easy to add a clause exempting such decisions from
stare decisis (which I think they should be).

Let's see, this requires some consideration for proper execution:

- 5 month plans
- Every Player proposes according to ability
- Each Player gets votes according to eir needs (properly documented, of
  course.  In quadruplicate.)
- Bring back Marks.  Karl Marks, dat is.
- Did I say proper _execution_?

Greetings,

The following is not a Proposal

Protoproposal VladCM v.1

Amend the last paragraph of Rule 1852 to read the following:

The Accountor is responsible for ensuring that the median number of
      Voting Tokens per Player in circulation does not exceed the
      Voting Token Circulation Level. To this end, at any time at
      which the median number of Voting Tokens per Player in
      circulation does exceed the Voting Token Circulation Level, but
      only at such a time, the Accountor is empowered and required to
      levy a tax on Voting Tokens, as described in other Rules.

The problem, as I see it, with this attempt is that it may be just as
difficult to ascertain what "the benefit of the doubt" for the actor
might be as it would to ascertain what the intent of the actor was.

They most certainly should not.  Such cases would create law on what
constitutes reasonable doubt and ambiguity, and on how to determine
what the benefit of the doubt is.  As such, they certainly should be
subject to stare decisis.  Remember, stare decisis only applies to
those holdings which are necessary to the decision.  If the decision
in a case is predicated on a finding of ambiguity, then that finding,
and the means by which it was found, are within the scope of stare
decisis.

Well, let the Player decide. Or let the Judge decide and let the
Player appeal if e disagrees.

I consider this a bug in the current system, too.  It technically places an infinite regress obligation on the Accountor to levy taxes on VTs whenever the VTCL is exceeded, since the level is not automatically reduced by levying taxes (that doesn't happen until enough Players actually pay them).  Although we've made a common-sense interpretation of this to avoid requiring the Accountor to levy taxes an uncountably infinite number of times, it still gives the Accountor the ability to levy taxes multiple times (daily, hourly, whatever) as long as the VT circulation amount exceeds the VTCL.  As long as you're proposing an amendment, you may as well fix this too.  I'd suggest restricting the tax to once every one or two weeks.

I think what Vlad is trying to do is establish an objective, rather
than subjective, test for mental state (intent or knowledge) when
mental state is at issue in some matter, and he is trying to place the 
burden of proof on the party alleging a discrepancy between the
objective mental state and the actor's express mental state.  (Is that 
abstract enough for you?)  

In other words, I think what Vlad is trying to say is that when mental
state is at issue in a matter, the Judge should base eir finding on
what a rational person would conclude the actor's mental state was
based on his conduct; if a rational person would be uncertain, then
the Judge should err in the favor of whatever the actor has expressed
eir mental state to have been.  (I think.  I have serious reservations 
about Vlad's "benefit of the doubt" language.)

I approve of the use of the objective test for mental state, but I am
not convinced that the presumption is proper.  It would be easier to
formulate this rule if our justice system were adversarial.  It is
not, and we should be cautioned from injecting notions extracted from
other, adversarial, judicial systems without careful consideration as
to whether they are appropriate in a nonadversarial one.

I might instead express Vlad's suggested rule as "When a Judge is
required to make a finding as to a actor's mental state, the Judge
shall base eir finding on what a reasonable person would conclude
about the actor's mental state from the actor's conduct.  'Mental
state' includes matters such as the knowledge or intent of an actor."

I still think it is grossly absurd that the taxation scheme does not
consider unpaid Payment Orders.  I got hit hard on the last taxation
cycle because the tax was levied after Salaries were paid but before I 
could pay my Voting debts.  This is absurd.

Of course, my true preference would be to repeal the tax altogether.

 places an infinite regress obligation on the Accountor to levy taxes
 on VTs whenever the VTCL is exceeded, since the level is not
 automatically reduced by levying taxes (that doesn't happen until
 enough Players actually pay them).  Although we've made a common-sense
 interpretation of this to avoid requiring the Accountor to levy taxes
 an uncountably infinite number of times, it still gives the Accountor
 the ability to levy taxes multiple times (daily, hourly, whatever)

I don't think so. Doesn't the first paragraph specifically exempt
Currencies that are the subject of an outstanding PO from being
counted towards the overall level?

But our system is de facto adversarial. Someone has to accuse me of 
a Crime (As I understand it, the proposed Rule only deals with
standards of evidence in Criminal cases). They say I did it, I say I
didn't. So "benefit of the doubt" does make sense in this context.

Protoproposal Chaos223 [rev. 2]

Revamp the Promotor's Office

Be it resolved, that Rules 109, 1036, 1839, 1770, 1771, 1772, 1773 and
1774 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) A Proposal enters the Proposal Queue when it is received
          from a Proposing Entity by the Promotor.

      (b) A Proposal leaves the Proposal Queue when it is distributed,
          withdrawn, or discarded, or when the Rules otherwise require
          it.

      (c) The Promotor may, by Public Forum Announcement, discard any
          Proposal in the Proposal Queue which was Proposed over a
          month previously and which has zero or negative Priority.

      (d) The Proposer of a Proposal in the Queue may, by Public Forum
          Announcement, remove that Proposal from the Queue.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Each Proposal in the Proposal Queue has a priority.
        (1) When a Proposal enters the Proposal Queue, it has a
            priority of zero.
        (2) Any Player may, by Public Forum Announcement, increase or
            decrease the Priority of a Proposal in the Proposal Queue
            by any amount provided that e simultaneously transfers to
            the Bank a number of P-Notes equal to the magnitude of the
            change e wishes to make, and that transfer is not made for
            any other purpose.
        (3) At most once in each week, the Promotor may, by Public
            Forum Announcement, increase by one the Priority of any
            Proposal in the Proposal Queue, provided that the Proposal
            was not Proposed by emself.
        (4) At the beginning of each month, the priority of all
            Proposals in the Proposal Queue which were proposed over a
            month previously is decreased by one.  The Promotor shall
            report all such changes as soon as possible after the
            beginning of the month.

      (b) Proposals in the Proposal Queue are sorted in Queue Order by
          ordering them by descending Priority; Proposals with the
          same Priority are ordered by increasing time in the Proposal
          Queue.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Each week, the Promotor shall select from the Proposal Queue
          and distribute a number of Proposals equal to that week's
          Proposal Limit.
        (1) The Proposal Limit for a given week shall be the lesser
            of:
          (A) the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue with
              Priority greater than zero at the time of the first
              distribution of Proposals in that week; and
          (B) the Maximum Proposal Limit in effect at the start of
              that week.
        (2) Proposals shall be selected for distribution from the head
            of the Proposal Queue, in descending Queue Order.

      (b) The Maximum Proposal Limit is an integer between two and
          six, inclusive.  The Promotor may set the Maximum Proposal
          Limit to any value in this range at any time by announcing
          the change in the Public Forum; the change takes effect 72
          hours after it is announced.  Until the Promotor sets
          another value, the Maximum Proposal Limit is three.

      (c) At the time the Promotor distributes a Proposal, e shall
          give it a unique identifier for reference.  No Proposal may
          be given the same identifier which was previously assigned
          to any other Proposal

      (d) The Promotor shall endeavor to distribute all of the
          Proposals required to be distributed in a given week at one
          time; however, supplemental distributions are permitted only
          within the same week if, for some reason, the previous
          distribution(s) in that week do not exhaust that week's
          Proposal Limit.

      (e) A message is a Proposal Distribution only if it claims
          explicitly to be so.  The message distributing a Proposal
          must set forth its exact text, and should also set forth the
          unique identifier assigned it by the Promotor, the identity
          of its Proposing Entity, and its requested Adoption Index. 
          Any error in the text of a distribution Proposal renders its
          distribution void, as is a second or subsequent distribution
          of a Proposal previously distributed.  An error in any other
          part of a distribution has no effect on the validity of that
          distribution.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) The Promotor shall publish the Proposal Queue weekly. This
          publication shall set forth, for each Proposal then in the
          Proposal Queue, in Queue Order:
        (1) a unique identifier assigned to it by the Promotor;
        (2) its Title;
        (3) its current priority; and
        (4) the date and time when it was Proposed.

      (b) This publication shall also describe any changes to the
          Priorities of the Proposals in the Queue and the reasons
          therefore.  This publication need not contain the text of
          Proposals in the Queue.
