No you, don't. It was false start; the music doesn't begin until
tomorrow.

Do you think that the way we have chosen to handle this situation is 
contrary to game custom? If so, I think I disagree. Oerjan's Judgement
in CFJ 866 provides us with the our definition of when a message is
received by the listserver - it is received when it enters the "normal
technical domain of control". I would say that a message which has been
trapped by majordomo for whatever reason has entered the normal technical
domain of control of the listserver, and so has been received.
