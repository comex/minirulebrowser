Yes, thank you. I rewrote it, and I obviously didn't proofread enough.

Protoproposal Chaos44 [rev. 12]

Oh, what a tangled web....

Be it resolved, that Rule 478 be amended to read:

      (a) A Public Forum is any medium of communication so designated
          as such by the Registrar.

      (b) The Registrar may designate any medium as a Public Forum, or
          revoke such designation from a medium already so designated,
          Without Objection.  However, the message which is to
          effectuate the change intended must be sent via a medium
          which is a Public Forum both before and after the
          designation or revocation, in order to have legal effect.

      (c) The Registrar may designate any medium (other than one which
          is designated as a Public Forum) as a Discussion Forum,
          Without Objection, and may revoke such designation in the
          same manner.  The designation of a medium as a Public Forum
          automatically revokes any designation of that same medium as
          a Discussion Forum.

      (d) Every Active Player shall ensure that e is able to receive
          messages sent to every medium which the Registrar has
          designated as a Public Forum.  However, the temporary
          inability of a Player to receive a Public Forum does not
          deprive that medium of its status as a Public Forum.

      (e) Any message conveyed by one or more Public Fora is deemed to
|         have been sent to the Public Forum. In addition, any message
|         sent, by any medium or combination of media, other than a
|         medium designated as a Discussion Forum, to every Active
|         Player so that each Active Player is reasonably certain to
|         receive it, is deemed to have been sent to the Public Forum,
|         but only if it bears an explicit indication that it is
|         intended to be a Public Forum message.

      (f) Whenever the Rules require a Player to "announce", "post",
          or "distribute" some communication or notification, that
          Player shall do so by sending it to the Public Forum, unless
          the Rules specify otherwise in that instance.

      (g) When the Rules require that a message be sent directly to a
          Player, or make a legal effect contingent on sending a
          message to a Player, the use of a Discussion Forum to send
          such a message shall not be effective unless the receiving
          Player explicitly or implicitly confirms having received
          that message.

Protoproposal Chaos75 [rev. 8]

Plainness is a Virtue

Be it resolved, that Rule 1023 be amended to read:

      (a) Any Player who fails to perform, in a timely manner, an
          action required of em by the Rules is guilty of Tardiness, a
          Class D Crime.

      (b) The definition of "a timely manner" shall be at the sound
          discretion of the Judge assigned to judge a CFJ alleging
          this crime, but shall in no case include:
        (1) intentional failures to perform; nor
        (2) intentional and excessive delays in performance.

      (c) Generally, performance within one week's time will be timely
          unless the Rules suggest otherwise.  The performance of
          actions in an order other than that in which the duties to
          perform them were incurred may be used as evidence of
          untimely performance, but is not proof thereof.

      (d) This Rule in no way modifies any requirement imposed by
          other Rules to perform specific acts within a specific time
          or in a specific order.

To easy for the objector to get around by voting against the proposal.
