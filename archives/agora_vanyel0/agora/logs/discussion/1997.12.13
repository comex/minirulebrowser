If we at first believe a Rule to have been enacted, and then
later determine that to be in error, then the Rule was never
enacted, not "incorrectly enacted."  As a Pragmatist you may
wish this was not the case, but our handling of the current
crisis clearly indicates that Agora is still entrenched in
the Platonic system.
