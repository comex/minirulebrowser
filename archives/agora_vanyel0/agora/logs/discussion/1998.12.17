I don't think game custom is relevant to this --- it seems like a clear
case of Rule 116 applying.

I regret that I have not been as active as I would have liked in
the past week or so in this debate.  Suffice it to say that I generally
agree with Crito, and since he has been doing an excellent job of
defending his position I don't have anything to add to what he's
said already. :)

I've been wrestling hard with my Judgement in CFJ 1111. I feel I am
close to accepting the Designation/Event model defended by Chuck and
Crito. But I remain troubled by aspects of the model, and I'm hoping
that either Crito or Chuck will be able to reassure me.

According to the D/E model, a Voting Period is a designated period of
time (hence its beginning and end are not genuine events), while votes
are ('genuine') events. We can, in the present, designate periods of
time already in the past as Voting Periods without acting retroactively
in violation of R108. This is the lesson of CFJ 944. We cannot, however,
change the legal status of votes that were cast in the past a result of
doing so, without acting retroactively in violation of R108.

I am troubled by the sense of a double standard lurking here, however.
If we can, in the present, change the description of some moment in time
in the past without acting retroactively, why can we not also, in the
present, change the description of some action in the past without
acting retroactively? 

Putting it another way: when talking of the Voting Periods of
P3810-3812, you say that it's what we *now* say that's important. We
*now* say that the VPs concluded at D+7. But when talking of the votes,
you say that it's what we *then* said that's important. The votes cast
after D+7 are legal because we would have said they were legal at the
time they were cast. What justifies these different and apparently
inconsistent ways of speaking?

Developed further, this first troubling thought brings others in its
train. Say we decide we want to speak consistently. Say further that we
wish to accept the precedent set by Chuck's Judgement in CFJ 944. Then
we should accept that in fact we *can*, in the present, change the
description of an action in the past, without violating R108. We can
say, for example, that although we would have said a vote was legal at
the time it was cast, that is not what we now say. We now say that the
vote was illegal. If we follow that line of thought, is there anything
at all that would qualify as a retroactive act? 

It would seem not. Even paradigmatic cases of retroactive effect would
seem to be permitted. Consider a Proposal which stated "Create a Rule
with the following text, to take effect 12 months before this Proposal
is adopted." Surely we can have no clearer example of the kind of thing
we expect R108 to prevent. Yet the action of this Proposal could be
described as follows: we are merely changing, in the present, our
descriptions of the past. Six months ago we would not have said that
this Rule was in effect at the time; now, we say that it was in effect
at that time.

That state of affairs seems unacceptable. The alternative is to reject
the precedent set by CFJ 944, that is, reject tout court the proposition
that we can in the present, change our descriptions of the past, without
acting retroactively. But CFJ 944 is the basis of the D/E model: if we
cannot change in the present our descriptions of the past, then we
cannot say now that the VPs for Proposals 3810-3812 ended at D+7, when
we would not have said this at D+7.

To save the D/E model, then, some answer must be given to the question I
raised above. We need some principled reason for distinguishing between
those aspects of the past whose descriptions we may permissibly change
in the present, and those we may not. 

Perhaps such a principled distinction can be provided. Although I
haven't been able to think of one myself yet, I haven't been thinking
about this particular problem for very long. And three heads, or 15, are
better than one.

Actually I agree with you. I was inspired to do it at the time 
I was making the ROM selection, so I did it that way, but I regret
doing it that way now. But what is done is done.

If I donated the P-Notes received (out of my own pocket, not the ROM's)
to a worthy cause (say, the Nomic Foundation for the Encouragement
New Players, if it still exists), would you consider voting 1 FOR 3816,
and thus cancelling out your vote AGAINST?
