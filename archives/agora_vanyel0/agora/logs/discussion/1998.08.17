We never did actually settle this question one way or the other,
Michael. I recall that we had this disagreement about the interaction of
Rules 1585, 1686 and 1023 back in April or May. The question is: when an
Officer with a responsibility to produce a Weekly Report resigns the
Office without having produced the Report for the Week in which e
resigned, does the new holder of the Office have a whole week to produce
the Report, or only until the end of the Week? At the time, I argued
that the new Office-holder does have a whole week - not least because we
have an explicit Judgement to that effect in CFJ 1061. You took the
opposite view, expressed above, that the new Officer has only until the
end of the Week. IIRC, this was because R1023, which is invoked via
R1585, claims to defer "to any Rules which impose different requirements
on the timing of Official Duties.", including R1686. At the time, I had
no reply to this argument, but now I think I do. (Some of my arguments
of late, however, have not been very good, so I'm not over-confident.)

I don't think you actually reported me for FtR until after a full week
had passed from the time Swann quit as Scorekeepor, so I don't think
anything was settled then on way or the other.

Anyway, here goes my attempt at a rebuttal. We have three Rules in play
here. I'll try to simplify the claims they make to expose the precedence
relationships between them, on which everything turns. From lowest to
highest precedence, the three Rules are:

R1686 (Power=1): New Officers have only until the end of the Week to Report.
R1585 (Power=2): New Officers have to Report as soon as possible.
R1023 (Power=2): ASAP = within 1 week. BUT this Rule defers to Rules
                 which impose different requirements.

Your argument was (correct me if I'm wrong): R1585 *looks* as though it
takes precedence over R1686 (lower Number and higher Power). But in fact
R1585 has only whatever authority it inherits from R1023, and R1023
defers to R1686, So, surprisingly, R1585 ends up deferring to R1686,
lower Number and higher Power notwithstanding. So Officers have only
until the end of the Week.

Now, my counterargument, by reductio: assume the above argument
succeeds. Then R1686 succeeds in imposing its time requirements, despite
the higher precedence R1585, only because of the intervention of the
even higher precedence R1023. Hence the responsibility for imposing the
stricter time requirement of R1686 lies equally, if not more heavily,
with R1023. By virtue of the action of its deference clause, R1023
imposes the stricter time requirement. But now look at that very
deference clause. It says that R1023 defers to Rules which impose
different time requirements. Well, what about R1585? If R1023 imposes a
stricter time requirement and R1585 a looser one, then R1023 defers to
R1585. Since R1585 takes precedence over R1686, the looser time
requirement should prevail. But by the same argument as before, R1023 is
equally responsible for imposing the looser time requirement, by virtue
of the action of its deference clause. But this is a contradiction:
R1023 cannot impose both the stricter and looser time requirements.

Normally, the next step in a reductio would be to say "Since the
assumption leads to a contradiction, we must reject the assumption."
In this case, this would mean rejecting the assumption that R1686
succeeds in tkaing precedence over R1585 via the intervention of R1023.
But of course, anyone who has read Suber knows that legal contradictions
are possible. It's entirely possible that the Rules in this case simply
are paradoxical. But in that case, we should rely on Morendil's
Judgement in R1061 to resolve the paradox.

Well, that all sounds very nice. We all love a good paradox after all.
But I think I know what you will say, Michael. You will say that what we
have to reject is the assumption that it is R1023 that imposes the
stricter time requirement; we should instead affirm that R1686 imposes
the stricter time requirement all on its own. R1023 allows this by
failing to prevent it, but one cannot impose by deferring. Am I right?

(Note to Rulekeepor Chuck: why has R1585 not been Annotated as Judge
Morendil required?)

Correction: I was the Judge of CFJ 1061; Morendil was the Caller.

No, I'm pretty sure I did cite you for FtR "immediately".  It may not
have felt like it though, because I have fallen into the habit of
issuing my official reports on Saturdays, which means that reports of
salaries for the week preceding take almost a week to appear.

I will try to read your argument again and more carefully, but I think
you've effectively summed up an argument for my position.  In
particular, R1023 doesn't impose any particular requirements; it is
definitional.  It tells us what we mean when we say "as soon as
possible".

However, I think a more important facet of this is the fact that rules
requiring an action to be performed as soon as possible do not
guarantee that someone performing the action within a week will not be
penalised by some other rule.  If Rule X says do Y asap, then the rule
for asap says that if you don't do it within a week, you will be
Tardy.  It explicitly says of itself that it yields to other rules,
but even if it didn't, I would still hold that another rule would be
permitted to penalise you for not doing Y quickly enough by some other
criterion.

Michael.

It sounds like you're advising us to vote AGAINST both proposals.
Apart from putting Bluesmobile back, what is the effect of INP381?  

I think though that there may be some point to the last sentence of
INP382.  At a guess, I'd say that the rule's author wants official
recognition of the correct state of play to be encoded in the
Moderator's list of member nomics.  If, up until this point, the IN
ruleset has been the only official document, and you then set up a new
one (the list of members), you might want to be sure that the new
document is correctly initialised.  With a self-deleting paragraph in
the new rule, the document will both be initialised, and then the
initialisation "code" will wipe itself.

Michael.

I'd definitely be interested.  Do we have any word on economic issues?
For example, wouldn't it be nice to be able to mint our own
currencies?  

Do you think we could perhaps begin a new mailing list (agora-merenth)
to discuss this?  It would be nice to have a venue where the relevant
SW people could join in, and not get swamped by CFJ case-sheets and
the obscure legalistic quibbling that we all delight in. :-)

Well, agora-merenth would be appropriate for discussion relating to
settling Merenth, and for a venue where SW people would also
contribute.  They might not be so interested in AgoraMOO related
stuff.  But, hey, let a thousand flowers bloom and a hundred schools
of thought contend, and all that.  I'm not trying to proscribe
AgoraMOO debate, but I think it might as well continue in
agora-discussion.  All of the interested parties in AgoraMOO are
presumably Players already.

Hmmm, are parties interested in Merenth not players of SW as
well ? Both M**s have mail systems and mailing list equivalents,
come to that; a mailing list is not strictly necessary. But if we're
going to have one, it might as well have a broad charter rather
than reflect interest in just one of the proposed ventures.

I, and the other MOO residents, would probably consider such a list
appropriate for discussing both worlds; quite probably even to make
comparisons between them when appropriate. It sounds slightly
parochial to call such a list agora-merenth, although I wouldn't
particularly mind - the particular name shouldn't have undue
influence on the *topics* discussed there.

No, I meant "interested parties in AgoraMOO are presumably Players of
Agora already".  It isn't the case that interested parties in the
Merenth enterprise are all Players of Agora (in particular, Merenth
settlers will initially need to interact with the relevant Gods and
Wizards, and then the SWPlayers that own property in Merenth).
Forcing those people to read agora-discussion to get at the stuff
relevant to them seems a bit steep.

On the other hand, forcing AgoraMOO people to read agora-discussion is
hardly an imposition because they're all likely to be reading it
already. 

To answer your question anyway; I don't believe that all those people
interested in Merenth *are* players of SW.  I'm not for a start;
(though this will probably change soonish).  Forcing people to use
MUD-mail when Internet mail is available also seems very perverse.

I think discussion that's general enough to be of interest to everyone
should be (cross-)posted to agora-discussion.  It's not as if any of
this aims to be exclusive; I made the suggestion simply as a way of
giving non-Agorans (and the SW people are the only such people we're
currently interested in talking to) an easy way of interacting with
us. 

Michael.

in Reply i would like to say:
1. Agora moo is getting more attention from non-agorans than you seem
to think, so:
1.a THERE:
1.b They might like an agora mud and moo list for the same reasons you
give.
2.  Just because you don't see our messages in discussion doesn't mean
they aren't flying back and forth copiously.
3.  We will be tackling similar issues so the list would benefit from
the AgoraMOO mail.
4.  i think you just  don't want us to steal your players, fraidy cat.

So in conclusion, I'm all for another list, but don't exclude us
AgoraMOOers!

Actually, the Rules already allow anyone to pay off any PO.  So you can offer
to pay any Blots incurred by anyone else.  Of course there is no way to enforce
your promise the way your solution would.

Well, in that case, if there are such people out there (non-Agorans
interested in AgoraMOO), then you're right, you do need a list for it.
I'm sure agora-moo would be a good name.

Oh, you mean you've already established an elite little list of your
own?   And I wasn't invited? :-)

Well, one particular area of concern on this putative list would be
issues of how Agora would come to take over an area on an existing
MUD.  This is quite a different project from the AgoraMOO one, so I
don't know that the two projects would have much to offer each other
in this respect.

I'd never recommend establishing a secret mailing list, but keeping a
list well-focussed can be a help to those people interested in just a
narrow area.

There's been a series of renamings concerning the various Micro- and

Heh, but AgoraMOO also wants non-lawyer residents - I mean,
participants who are not Agorans. As a topic, 'Agora's extension to
virtual realities' would be of interest to such persons, and cross-
discussions of Merenth and AgoraMOO might benefit both worlds.

Yeah. :)

I think both worlds might form a keen interest in exchanging players.
Shattereds for whom the theme and set of quests of their 8-year old
world risks becoming stale might welcome the chance to be in on
the creation of a fresh territory, and builders on the MOO will want
to see existing worlds to find out which parts are fun and which are
bores.

Then again, there'd be nothing wrong with broadening that focus
initially and splitting the list if it looks like it needs narrowing.

It's called news in AgoraMOO.
Also we talk in person in the MOO, as well as mail each other within
the moo and without.  I think that Agora would benefit from a new mail
list to discuss it's settlements, both in SW and AgoraMOO. Despite the
fact that you have an established world, i think there would be enough
overlap to justify a common list.

I as a member of the merchant's guild am very interested in a forum
where I can tout the virtues of out new world, as well as learn of
another.  I think that it would be easy enough to split the list later,
Agora's lists have split before.

It would help if we had some 'real' money to deal with. Scott, will
you be completing work on that, or should I take it over ?

Please, feel free to take it over.  I have become unexpectedly
swamped these past few days, and expect that state to remain in force
for at least two weeks.
