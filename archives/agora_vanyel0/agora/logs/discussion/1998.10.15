Did Assessor Blob ever issue a PO ordering the OEE to pay 2 VTs for the

So why not delete the first sentence altogether (rewriting the

I actually think this is practical.  The present rules for recording
POs and TOs are straightforward enough to permit automization without
much difficulty.

I'm not quite sure what you mean by that. Isn't true that I transfer 1
VT to Jack by saying (to the Accountor) "I hereby transfer 1 VT to
Jack."?

One way of thinking abut the problem is to think about the meaning of
R1011's provision that "no Nomic Property shall be changed except in
accordance with procedures specified by the Rules." Now, we have
procedures defined by the Rules for transferring Currencies. I take it
that we agree that posting a message to PF saying "I hereby transfer 1
VT to Jack" satisfies those procedures. The question is: what about "I
hereby transfer 1 VT to Jack if I have sufficient funds to do so."? And
what about other conditional contructions, or less specific
constructions? Do they satisfy the procedures specified by the Rules? So
far, it's been a bit of a grey area, left up to the discretion of
Recordkeepors and occasionally the judgement of Judges. It may well be a
good idea to try to legislate more precisely than we have so far done
what kinds of acts do and do not satisfy the procedures for transferring
Currencies. I very much doubt that in advance of such legislation, it is
possible to determine from first principles whether conditional actions
are or are not possible, or legal.

Protoproposal Chaos47 [rev. 5]

Winning

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 112 have its Power changed to 1.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 112 be amended to read:

      (a) A "potential winner" is any Player for whom, at a given
          time, at least one of the Winning Conditions, and none of
          the Win-Preventing Conditions, then defined by the Rules,
          were satisfied with respect to that Player.

      (b) A "potential win" occurs at any time that there is at least
          one potential winner.  

      (c) A Speaker's Report of a Win is an announcement by the
          Speaker stating that one or more Players have won.  Such a
          report must identify the time at which the Player or Players
          won, and the Winning Condition(s) satisfied by each such
          Winner.

      (d) Upon the announcement of Speaker's Report of a Win, all
          Players named therein as Winners Win; however, if the
          Speaker retracts the Report of a Win, all benefits which may
          have accrued to those Players as a result of having Won are
          revoked, to the extent that doing so is legal.

      (e) The Speaker is required to report a Win as soon as possible 
          after a potential win occurs.

      (f) If the Speaker reports a Win which does not correspond to a
          potential win, e is required to retract the report as soon
          as possible thereafter.

      (g) Any person who believes the Speaker has violated
|         subdivisions (e) or (f) of this Rule may Call for Judgment
          alleging that the Speaker has violated the appropriate
          subdivision.  If the Judge finds that a violation has
          occured, the Judge shall enter an Order compelling the
          Speaker to comply with the subdivision in question.

      (h) Any Speaker who is found by CFJ to have issued a Report of a
          Win in bad faith shall be Tainted.

Only as a matter of law.  Absent provisions in the law to give legal
meaning to your utterance, it would be nothing more than a meaningless
utterance.  It would be foolhardy for me to say that by posting a
message that states "I hereby change Steve's nickname to Foozle" that
Steve's nickname would become Foozle.  I hold that this is the
situation independent of Rule 1011's existence.  98% of what we do in
Agora is utter statements.  Some of those statements are given legal
meaning by specific operation of the Rules.  The rest have no legal
meaning, even when their utterers intend for them to do so.  (The
remaining 2% is manipulating official documents, and is something that
only Officers do, usually because someone uttered something that
created an obligation to perform the required manipulation.)

Of course, someone adhering to the "avatar" or "role playing"
conceptual model will disagree with the above argument.  But I believe
I've demonstrated before that the avatar model has serious
problems. :)

OK. We agree about all of that, as should have been clear from the
paragraph that you didn't quote, where I developed pretty much the same
view. Utterances have what force they have only as a matter of law. But
it follows from this that conditional utterances can have force given
to them by the law, too, and such seems to be the case at the moment
with some kinds of conditional utterances, which are accepted as having
legal force.

>Of course, someone adhering to the "avatar" or "role playing"

I don't immediately see the connection, myself. My memory (which may be
faulty) of the debate about avatar theory was that it concerned the
question of whether requirements placed on Players should be understood
to be requirements placed on persons, with the result of the debate
being a decision in favour of the affirmative answer to that question.
It's not obvious to me that a defender of the avatar view has to be
committed, in addition, to the view that an avatar has the general power
to make things the case by say that they are thus-and-so.

Sure.  It would simplify things quite a bit, if only as a stop-gap

I would tend to believe that conditional utterances should have legal
effect only when the Rules so provide.  Absent provisions allowing
conditional or delayed effect, I should think that neither should be
allowed as a matter of course, as allowing them amounts to allowing a
Player to make an "ad hoc" amendment to the Rules.  Of course, our
Game Custom is to the contrary, so a Rule will be necessary to impose
this.  Hm.

Re: DIS: Failure to Report?

In my experience, logging the salary and unemployment benefit transactions were
the most time consuming feature.  Not much you can do about that short of
getting rid of them (Scott's solution).  The only other thing that might work
is to require POs and TOs to be sent in a form that can easily be parsed by a
computer program.  This would require a fixed standard for identifying POs. 
Two possibilities there that I can think of:  1) use a fixed format 'date,
time, issuer' identifier; 2) let the Recordkeepor generate a fixed format
identifier (as we now do) and delay payoff obligations until e has posted the
PO with the identifier.  I think I prefer #1, myself.  Of course, this only
helps if the Recordkeepor can get or create useful software.

What do you think?  If Scott does not succeed in dismantling the economy and
y'all like this idea, I'll be glad to work up a proposal to codify these ideas.

Re: The lack of an Accountor's Report.

Can we now do what I suggested several months ago, and reset the VTs 
system to some agreeable state? Things are just getting way out of hand.

Also, what can we do, apart from following Scott's suggestion and nuking
the entire system, to prevent this sort of thing from happening again?
Is there some way we can simplify the Accountor's job?

Two orthogonal concepts, I believe.  It is possible to have either
one without the other, or both together.

I won't argue with that.

I was recently discussing with Lee the possibility of creating an Automated
Transaction Server.  Players would submit TOs and POs to it and it would do
all the work.  I've often wondered why this hadn't already been done.

I think I tend to agree but could you outline your thoughts on this?
