No, it's exactly the sort of thing I was telling you wasn't worth
_legislating_ about. And my offer is an example of just that. I trust you
enough to make you a loan without issuing a PO requiring you to repay
it. I trust you because I believe you are an honourable player, and 
because you wouldn't want to get a reputation for welching on debts.
And if you do defect on the loan, I believe I would be able to organise
sanctions that would make you regret the decision. Ergo, no rules are
required.

I meant that it would be difficult to produce a reasonably accurate
Report, one that would be better than just starting again with an
arbitrary Budget produced by a Treasuror as per Blob's proto. Of course,
it's trivially easy to produce a Report; lee could publish his Sep 21
Report (or whenever his last Report was) tomorrow. But how many errors
are you going to put up with?

I don't really care too much how many errors there are, as long as the
figure attributed to me is reasonably close to what I would expect it
to be.  Crito, as Judge, recently computed an estimate for the number
of VTs I should have, and I have no reason to doubt the reasonableness
of that estimate.  I'm sure similar estimates can be calculated for
each Player without undue hardship.

My time cost in figuring out what you might be willing to accept in
exchange for one P-Note, factoring into the calculus the probability
that I will miscalculate and offer you something worth either nothing
or substantially more than one P-Note.

How could you offer something worth more than one P-note? The market
value of an item is what someone is willing to pay for it. Since there
is no market in P-Notes, whatever you offer sets the current market
value.

I might offer something to Steve that I think he would be willing to
exchange for one P-Note that he is in fact willing to exchange for,
say, three P-Notes.  If I were to do so, I would effectively be out
two P-Notes.  I have no reason to expect Steve to offer to pay three
P-Notes when my offer asks for one; that would be irrational on his
part.

c647100> The market value of an item is what someone is willing to pay

The problem is that I lack information as to what anyone is willing to
pay for the various things I might be willing to offer.  Market
friction is nearly infinite; consequently, transaction costs are
prohibitively high.  And, at the moment, my desire for P-Notes is not
high enough to overcome the risk of a bad bargain.

No, the worst thing that could happen is that I get screwed by a bad
bargain, giving up far too much for a paltry handful of P-Notes.

I would think that the important part of the equation is what a P-note
is worth to you, not what it is worth to Steve (after all, presumably it
is worth more to you, assuming he is willing to make the trade). It is
also possible that he may overvalue your exchange items, allowing
you to fleece him (which may be your goal, pretending to be so hesitant
and all :-). At any rate, there is a solution: start outrageously low and
haggle your way up.

we've put the entire VT part of the economy on hold while we wait for
lee to catch up - and there's no guarantee that he is going to catch up.

That's true. But what alternative do we have? If lee doesn't produce a
somewhat acceptable report, noone ever will.

In any case, it is certain to be very difficult, and

I wonder what the legal status of a provisional report would be if it
obviously contains only educated guesses about everyone's VT holdings,
and no, or no complete, records of recent POs and TOs. Would it have
any value? Even if it is not challenged by any player now, would that
protect us from a challenge to the VT records in, say, two months?

I think we either have to wait for lee, or construct and use some kind
of reset button. I have been talking to lee about this about two weeks
ago. Then he sounded confident that he can produce an acceptable
report now that the BOS and the VT cost is at zero, and I decided to
hope for the best and wait.

[snip]

Amend 1854 to read

      The Chancellor can set the level of the Basic Officer Salary
      by announcing in the Public Forum that e is doing so, provided
      that e announces a value between 0 VTs and 8 VTs inclusive,
      that e makes the announcement before the 25th day of the month, and
      that the Basic Officer Salary has not already been set by a
      similar such announcement earlier in the month.
<<

Although the current VT record crisis is not over yet, I'd still
encourage the Chancellor to raise to BOS to above zero again for
December. This has to be announced in the next week or so.

I hope that by the beginning of December lee will be able to present a
report. If he isn't, we're in trouble no matter what the BOs is. OTOH,
with the BOS zero for another full month, we only have a chance to get
back to a normal VT economy next January, which sounds pretty late...

You might generalize it even more and fold it into the Applications
mechanism: allow both signatures for and signatures against an
application.  Then its effectiveness can be based on either
the number of signatures for, number against, or both, that
it carries.  Our current WO mechanism would be equivalent to
allowing an Application to be effective if it had no signatures
against when executed.

Good heavens, Scott, you spend 20 hours a week writing proposals for a
*game*, not mention your dozens of weekly posts on matters great and
small. Now hardly seems to be the moment to start worrying about time
costs.

I think this is an unpleasant consquence of Monthly Salaries. The BOS
needs to be able to be set more often than monthly. Once a month is too
coarse a level of control.

20 hours a week?  Ye gods, not even close.  5, maybe.  I use Agora as
a distraction when my studies start to get too annoying (which is
about once every couple of hours).

I'm surprised that you trust yourself so little to determine what is or
is not in your own interests. I'm also surprised to find you so fearful
of making mistakes. After all, even if you were for some reason to
strike a bargain you later regretted, why would that be so catastrophic?
You live and learn. It's just a game after all; nothing of tremendous
importance hangs on it. It's not as if you'll go to prison, or lose your
home or family.

Nonsense. Money invested is not money lost. On this reasoning, no-one
would ever agree to pay interest on any loan. With careful play, it is
possible to achieve a return of 3 P-Notes on a single Proposal (two from
R833 and one from R1047). If I were to lend you, say, 3 P-Notes, it
would be possible, with careful play, for you to realize a return of 9
P-Notes on your 'investment' (the investment consists in raising the
Priority of some of your Proposals). You could then afford not only to
pay me back my initial investment of 3 P-Notes, but even to pay me some
substantial interest, say 2 P-Note, and still keep a whopping 4 P-Notes
clear profit for yourself. Admittedly that is a best-case scenario.
However, even without the Zeitgeist reward, you could still make a
profit. In fact, if you could get just two Proposals passed out of
three, in different weeks, even if not unanimously, you'd make 4 P-Notes
from R833, enough to pay me back (although without interest), and still
have an extra P-Note for yourself left over at the end. And all of this
without even mentioning the benefit you realize from being able to
pursue some of your extensive legislative program.

(And to think only a few days ago I was arguing that we don't have
venture capitalism in Agora! If this is the kind of economy Scott wants
for Agora, then I'm all for it.)

You could easily acquire such information at almost no cost to yourself.
Your real problem is that you're too proud to ask.

Mmm, surely in the above Kolja should be listed as having NetPOs to the
value of +2 P-Notes (not +1), and the Bank listed as having NetPOs to
the value of -2 P-Notes (not 0)?

Obviously, your program isn't very sophisticated.

(Alternately, you could just manually correct this rather than blindly
dumping the output of an unsophisticated program to us.)

Sounds to me like you ought to run for Treasuror, with a campaign
