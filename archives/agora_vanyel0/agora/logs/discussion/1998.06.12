It seems pretty clear to me, at least in purely theoretical terms,
that if the Goldbach conjecture is false, then it can be proven to
be false.  I'm no formal mathematician or logician, but I'll try
to be as formal as I can.

Let us assume that the Goldbach conjecture is false.  This means that
there exists an even integer N, greater than 4, which cannot be
expressed as the sum of two odd prime numbers.

In other words, for every odd prime number a<N, N-a is not prime.
It seems to me all we have to do to demonstrate that N cannot
be expressed as the sum of two odd prime numbers is to find
all odd primes a<N, and show that every N-a is composite.  (Actually,
we only need to check all primes a<=(N/2), but that doesn't affect
my proof.)

Now, we apply this test--to determine whether N can expressed
as the sum of two odd primes--to every even number beginnning with
6.  For a given N, the process terminates in a finite amount of
time (want me to prove this?  I hope it's obvious, because
it's intuitive to me, but it would take quite a bit more
work to prove it.)  Since the smallest N which is a counterexample
to Goldbach is finite, it will be found in a finite amount of time.
(Actually, I think for the proof we don't have to worry about how
we found N.  It's enough that it exists, and we can verify that
it's a counterexample to Goldbach.  But my-increasingly-less formal
proof seems stronger if we can find N in a finite time, not just
verify that it's a counterexample.)

So although the time needed to find the counterexample is unknown, if 
it exists, the time is finite.  Thus, if Goldbach is false, it
can be proved to be false.

Thus: if Goldbach cannot be proved to be false, it is true.

Thus: if Goldbach cannot be proved to be false, and cannot be
      proved to be true, it is true.

Thus: A proof that Goldbach cannot be proved to be either true or
      false is a proof that Goldbach is true; reductio ad absurdum,
      A proof that Goldbach cannot be proved to be either true or
      false does not exist.

Again, this is from a purely theoretical standpoint.  From a practical
standpoint, it may be that the smallest counterexample N is so large
that it cannot be proved to be a counterexample to Goldbach, given the
limitations on space, time, matter, and energy in the universe.

It is at this point in the argument that the constructionist will
want to object: concepts cannot outrun our ability to apply them,
and we must be careful to what concept of provability we appeal
here. There are a number of possibilities here, and they lead to
different strengths of constructionism:

1. The counterexample to Goldbach's Conjecture (GC) exists, but
cannot be calculated by a human being with human limitations, without
prosthetic aids (such as computers). This is very strict, and I doubt
many constructionists take this line, although Wittgenstein (who lived
before computers seems to have been tempted by it in some moods).

2. The counterexample to GC exists, but cannot be calculated even
by a prosthetically extended human being.

3. The counterexample to GC exists, but cannot be calculated by
any sentient being, even one limited only constraints of physical
law.

If (3) is the case, it seems plausible to say that GC is false but
not provably false - or to drop the claim that GC determinately
is true or false.

The above message was stamped Thu, 11 Jun 1998 18:41:04 -0400 - about
7 hours after the VP for Proposals 3755-3757 concluded. So your
declaration of Presence on P3757 came too late. Your vote FOR
P3758 is noted.

Um, that should be 3755, not 3756.  Not that it matters.

But in the CFJ Macross argued that the emended whatever-it-is was not

I think this argument completely ignores the third paragraph of Rule
1793:

      Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Order, the purpose of which is
      to affect the operation of a prior Order, is as valid as any
      other Order, and is said to be directed at the prior Order it
      affects.

It's quite clear to me that this means that Orders to Amend do not
need to be directed at any Player, or require any Action.
<<

Good point. Of course orders, including orders to amend, need not be
directed at players - any entities can be targetted. I still believe
that the definition of orders requires that it orders some action or
other, but then I would interpret the clear language of 1793, which I
had indeed overlooked, to imply that there is _some_ sensible action
connected to an order to amend, whatever it is, and that it is
therefore possible to amend orders.

Because at the moment, with secrecy and no declarations of presence,
we need at least 5 VTs to get any individual proposal through. And
only some 10 VTs or so are entering circulation every week (at the
moment, with hardly any farms operational). That's just enough for 2
proposals, so if we aim at a constant no of VTs of circulation (and
players have always tended to hoard VTs, so this is a conservative
estimate) and you distribute three proposals per week, at least one of
them is guaranteed to fail quorum.

Which may not be a bad thing, mind you, but while it will mark the
success of the current attepmts to get a meaningful economy going, it
would also lead to attempts to water down scarcity again (as you,
Crito, have suggested recently).

Dan Knapp, liaison of New Rishonnomic, just told wrote on the IN list
that INP379 is just to account for a recent renaming of
Micronomic.

BUS: The Historical Agoran vol 1, no 1

Swann,

Thank you *very* much for undertaking this enterprise.  The next time I feel
like de-Kudoing someone, I know where it will go.  8)

Fair enough.  However, there are a significant number of VTs already in
circulation.  I think I will leave the batch size at 3 for the moment.  This
might be an incentive for Players to get Plots going before the current
"excess" becomes too depleted.  It will be interesting to see if we can even
get *two* proposals passed in a batch anyway.  8)
