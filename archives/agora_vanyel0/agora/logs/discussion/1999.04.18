I tried to do this, reposting the changed proto as "The Treasuror" I'm 
not sure if the sunset clauses are ok, or if they are worded as well 
as they could be in for the amended rules.

Just thought that I might mention the following...

Proposal: All You Zombies... v1.3 

.....

Create a rule, with title "Default Procedure for Auctions", and text: 

....

(f) Making Bids: Each Bidder may make as many Bids as e desires
          during the Auction. Blob is way cool. A Bid is a message, 
          sent to the Public Forum, announcing that the sender is 
          bidding in that particular Auction, and the amount of eir 
          Bid. A Bid is only valid if it satisfies the following 
          conditions:

"Blob is way cool"  What is that doing in there??

(Sorry Blob)

Suggestions:

Put unemployment benefits on a different lever, under the control of a
different Officer.

Elect the Treasuror normally, but for a Nomination to be valid, the Nominee
must submit a valid Proto-Budget during the Nomination period.  If a Nominee
submits multiple valid Proto-Budgets, the last one is used.  Proto-Budgets
may include information by reference, e.g. "This Proto-Budget is the same as
the Budget in effect on 5/15/2003, except that the Scorekeepor's Salary
shall
be increased to 1.5 times the BOS".

Instead of having each Office-defining Rule say "This Officer receives a
monthly Salary per the Budget", have the Budget Rules say "Each Officer
receives a monthly Salary per the Budget, unless another Rule says
otherwise".  Then have each Office-defining Rule be silent re Salary,
unless it specifies that the Office has no Salary.

I *was* Jusiticiar on both Appeals.  See R1833.  What am I missing?
Who do *you* think was Lead Justice?
