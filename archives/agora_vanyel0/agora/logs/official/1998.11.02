Repeal-O-Matic Rule selection for Nov 02 1998
---------------------------------------------
There are 332 rules in the latest short logical ruleset.
Selecting five at random gives:

 30 : Rule 113  (Players may always opt out)
250 : Rule 1701 (Proposal Notes) 
 59 : Rule 1553 (Officer Transition)
136 : Rule 1799 (Amendment, Stay, and Vacation of Orders)
209 : Rule 1044 (Unique Patent Titles)

Rule 1044 seems to be dead wood, there being no Unique Patent Titles
currently defined in our Ruleset, so:

On behalf of the Repeal-O-Matic, I propose:

PROPOSAL: Repeal Rule 1044 (Unique Patent Titles)
      This Proposal shall have an AI = 
      Rule 1044 is hereby Repealed.

Proposal  (Gen Chaos) AI = 2
Restore Sanity

NOTE: Text enclosed in right brackets has no legal significance and
      shall in no way affect the legality or efficacy of any part of
      this Proposal.

[This Proposal does not seek to eradicate either Voting Tokens or
 P-Notes; it merely removes them from having any role in the process
 of making or voting upon Proposals.  I will leave it for later to
 decide what should be done with the Currencies themselves.]

Be it hereby resolved, that Rule 206 ["Voting Entities and Votes"] be
      amended to read:

      (a) Each Player is entitled to cast at most one Vote upon each
          Proposal.

      (b) A Player may be deprived of the right to cast a Vote upon
          any one Proposal, or upon Proposals generally, by the Rules
          or by an Order issued pursuant to the Rules.

      (c) No entity other than a Player may cast Votes upon
          Proposals.

      (d) The term "Voting Entity" is hereby declared to be synonymous
          with "Player", except where such construction would clearly
          not make sense.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1442 ["The Cost of Voting"] be
      repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1765 ["Attributing Additional
      Votes"] be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 683 be amended to read:

      (a) A Player casts a vote upon a Proposal by sending a message to
          the Assessor specifying the Vote e is casting and the Proposal
          upon which it is cast.

      (b) A vote cast under this Rule must be one of FOR, AGAINST, or
          ABSTAIN, or an obvious synonym thereof.

      (c) Any attempt by a Player to cast a vote is void and without
          legal effect if:
        (1) the attempt is made other than during the Voting Period of
            the Proposal in question,
        (2) the Player attempting to cast a Vote is barred from
            Voting upon that Proposal by the Rules or by an Order then
            in effect barring em from doing so,
        (3) the Player attempting to cast a Vote has previously cast a
            vote (other than a vote made void by this subrule) upon
            that Proposal, or
        (4) the attempt violates, or if allowed would violate, this or
            any other Rule.

      (d) Votes, once cast according to this Rule, cannot be
          retracted, cancelled, or changed except when the Rules
          require it, and then only as required by the Rules.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1715 ["Announcing One's Presence"]
      be repealed.  [Presence is irrelevant with free voting.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1449 ["The Assessor"] be amended to
      read:

      There shall exist the Office of Assessor.  The Assessor shall
      receive a weekly salary equal to the Basic Officer Salary.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1824 ["Debt Voting"] be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1660 ["The Speaker's Vote"] be
      repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1760 ["Quorum Buyback"] be
      repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1723 ["Sanity"] be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1724 ["Urgent Proposals"] be
      repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1036 ["The Proposal Queue"] be
      amended, by replacing the word "zero" with "one" wherever it
      appears.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1771 ["Increasing Priority"] be
      amended to read:

      (a) Not more than once in any Nomic Week, each Player may select
          any one Proposal in the Proposal Queue and may increase or
          decrease the priority of that Proposal by one, by sending a
          message to the Promotor indicating the Proposal to be
          affected and whether that Proposal's priority is to be
          increased or decreased.

      (b) An attempt to change the Priority of a Proposal in the
          Proposal Queue shall be void and without legal effect if:
        (1) the Player who attempted it has already changed the
            priority of any Proposal during the same Nomic Week;
        (2) the attempt relates to a Proposal which is no longer in
            the Proposal Queue; or
        (3) the change attempted would result in the Proposal having a
            priority less than zero.

      (c) The Promotor and the Speaker shall each be permitted to
          exercise the right given by subrule (a) of this Rule twice
          in each week, instead of once.  However, if the same Player
          is both Promotor and Speaker, e may not exercise this right
          three times.  The remainder of this Rule shall be
          interpreted so as to be consistent with the intent of this
          subrule.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1772 ["Promotor's Privilege"] be
      repealed.  [The privilege is incorporated into the revised Rule
      1771.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1862 ["The Voting Tariff"] be
      repealed.

Proposal  (Gen Chaos) AI = 1
End the Conspiracy!

NOTE: Text enclosed in right brackets has no legal significance and
      shall in no way affect the legality or efficacy of any part of
      this Proposal.

Be it hereby resolved, that Rule 1855 ["Plots"], Rule 1856
["Adjacency"], Rule 1860 ["Officers may not own plots"], Rule 1843
["Buying and Selling Plots"], Rule 1844 ["Winning by Ownership"], Rule
1845 ["Structures"], Rule 1846 ["Ergs"], Rule 1848 ["Types of
Structures"], Rule 1849 ["Maintenance of Structures"], Rule 1850
["Production of Structures"], Rule 1851 ["Standard Types of
Structures"], and Rule 1857 ["The Cartographor"] be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1677 ["Currency Awards for new
Players"] be amended to read:

      As soon as possible after the start of a Player's Grace Period,
      the Registrar shall pay out 5 Voting Tokens and 1 P-Note to that
      Player.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Gen Chaos) AI = 1
Slam the Door

NOTE: Text enclosed in right brackets has no legal significance and
      shall in no way affect the legality or efficacy of any part of
      this Proposal.

Be it hereby resolved, that Rule 1631 ["Membership of InterNomic"],
Rule 1633 ["InterNomic Proposals"], Rule 1748 ["Awards for Internomic
Proposals"], Rule 1632 ["InterNomic Voting Procedure"], Rule 1635
["Calling for InterNomic Judgement"] and Rule 1634 ["InterNomic
Judgement"] be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      The Ambassador is hereby directed to inform the InterNomic
      Moderator that Agora Nomic has elected, in accordance with
      its Rules and as permitted by the Rules of InterNomic, to
      withdraw from InterNomic.

      Within one week of doing so, the Ambassador shall propose that
      this Rule be repealed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Gen Chaos) AI = 1
Every Man Is an Island

NOTE: Text enclosed in right brackets has no legal significance and
      shall in no way affect the legality or efficacy of any part of
      this Proposal.

Be it therefore resolved, that Rules 766, 716, 719, 721, 1752, 718,
1446, 1539, 1528, 1614, 1612, 1531, 1547, 1759, 1533, 1397, 1617,
1458, and 717 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 206 be amended, by replacing
"Players and Groups are Voting Entities" with "Players are Voting
Entities".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1637 be amended, by deleting the
paragraph which begins "A Will belonging to an Organization".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1727 be amended, by deleting the
paragraph which contains the phrase "the Notary may select".

Be it further resolved, that Rules 1601, 1637, 1738, and 1757 all be
amended, by replacing the word "Notary" with the word "Chancellor"
wherever it may appear.

[While there may be some utility in allowing bodies corporate, the
current Rules woefully fail to accomplish this in any useful sense.
Furthermore, most contests can be adequately carried forth under the
Law of Contracts (Rule 1742) without requiring the overhead of
statutory support.  SLCs should probably also go, but I'll cross that
bridge when I find it.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Macross) AI = 1
A Duty to Propose

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "A Duty to Propose", be
created with the following text:

      Every Player has a Public Service Status which takes exactly one
      of the values: Served, or Required to Serve. Initially, every
      Player's Status is Served. The Promotor shall maintain a list of
      all Players, including for each Player eir Public Service Status,
      and the date at which eir Status last changed to Served, or the
      date at which e last submitted a Proposal, whichever is later. The
      list shall be sorted on this date, from earliest to latest, with
      ties being broken alphabetically. The Promotor shall include this
      list in eir Promotor's Report.

      As soon as possible after the beginning of each Week, the Promotor
      shall select the two Active Players not in their Grace Periods
      highest on the list (at the time of selection) who are not already
      Required to Serve, and change their Statuses from Served to
      Required to Serve, by announcing this change in the Public Forum.

      Any Player who is Required to Serve continuously for 14 days has
      their Status changed to Served and commits the Infraction of
      Failure to Propose, incurring a penalty of 1 Blot and 1 P-Note, to
      be detected and reported by the Promotor.

      Whenever any Player submits a Proposal, eir Public Service Status
      changes to (or remains as) Served.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Gen Chaos) AI = 1
Oh, what a tangled web....

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 478 be amended to read:

      (a) A Public Forum is any medium of communication so designated as
          such by the Registrar.

      (b) The Registrar may designate any medium as a Public Forum, or
          revoke such designation from a medium already so designated,
          Without Objection.  However, The message which is to
          effectuate the change intended must be sent via a medium
          which is a Public Forum both before and after the
          designation or revocation, in order to have legal effect.

      (c) Every Active Player shall ensure that e is able to receive
          messages sent to every medium which the Registrar has
          designated as a Public Forum.  However, the temporary
          inability of a Player to receive a Public Forum does not
          deprive that medium of its status as a Public Forum.

      (d) Any message conveyed by one or more Public Fora is deemed to
          have been sent to the Public Forum.

      (e) The above notwithstanding, any message sent, by any medium or
          combination of media, to every Active Player so that each
          Active Player is reasonably certain to receive it, is deemed
          to have been sent to the Public Forum, but only if it bears
          a clear indication that it is intended to be a Public Forum
          message.

      (f) Whenever the Rules require a Player to "announce", "post", or
          "distribute" some communication or notification, that Player
          shall do so by sending it to the Public Forum, unless the
          Rules specify otherwise in that instance.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Gen Chaos) AI = 2
Unlimited Voting

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 206 be amended to read:

      (a) A Voting Entity is an Entity which is generally authorized
          by the Rules to cast a vote or votes on a Proposal.  Other
          Rules may withdraw this authorization from a Voting Entity
          in specific circumstances without that Entity thereby
          ceasing to be a Voting Entity.  Only those Entities
          designated by the Rules to be Voting Entities are Voting
          Entities.

      (b) No Entity is permitted to vote on a Proposal unless it is a
          Voting Entity.

      (c) Players and Groups are Voting Entities.

      (d) Unless otherwise specified, each Voting Entity may cast an
          unlimited number of Votes on a Proposal.

Be it further resolved, that Rules 1660 and 1765 be repealed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal  (Gen Chaos) AI = 1
No Passing the Buck

Be it therefore resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      (a) A Recordkeepor may elect to reject any Transfer Order or
          Payment Order, the amount of which is not specified by its
          Executor as a fixed numeral.

      (b) The actual numerical value of the amount of a Transfer or
          Payment Order whose amount was not specified by its Executor
          as a fixed numeral is whatever the Recordkeepor, in good
          faith, determines it to be at the time the Order was
          submitted.

      (c) For the purpose of this Rule, a "fixed numeral" is a
          numerical constant specified in a manner that the
          Recordkeepor may determine its value with definite certainty
          without referring to any information in the Game State other
          than the message itself.

[This is to prevent Players from stating that they "execute whatever
 Payment Orders they are required to execute" or "transfer all but two
 VTs to some entity", thereby transferring the responsibility to
 determine what they are legally required to do to Recordkeepors,
 and/or creating uncertainty in Currency Records by specifying

Language shall be Plain

      In the construction or interpretation of the Rules, all words
      and phrases shall be taken in their plain, or ordinary and
      usual, sense, except where doing so would be plainly repugnant
      to the context of those words or phrases.  Technical words and
      phrases having a peculiar and appropriate meaning shall be
      understood according to their technical import.

Some Housecleaning

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 408 be amended to read:

      (a) The Judge of an open CFJ is required to, within seven days of
          when that CFJ last became open or seven days of eir
          assignment to that CFJ, whichever is later, close that CFJ
          by dismissing or judging the CFJ and/or granting or denying
          any outstanding judicial motions pertaining to that CFJ.

      (b) The failure of a Judge to close a case within the prescribed
          time constitutes the Infraction of Judicial Tardiness and
          carries a penalty of one Blot for each day (or fraction
          thereof) that the case remains open beyond the permitted
          time.  This penalty is to be reported by the Clerk of the
          Courts.

      (c) The failure to observe this time limit does not, by itself,
          cause the delinquent Judge to be recused from the CFJ, nor
          does it invalidate eir judgment or dismissal of the CFJ or
          grant or denial of any related judicial motion which that
          Judge might submit after the limit has expired.

      (d) This Rule defers to any other Rule which prescribes a
          different time limit in which a CFJ must be closed, and to
          any other Rule which establishes procedures by which the
          time limit specified in this Rule may be extended or
          shortened.

[This is a slightly modified version of a rule I proposed last
 November, and which was adopted but clobbered by the contemporaneous
 adoption of another Proposal.]

Evidentiary Status of Officer Reports

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1768 be amended to read:

      (a) The published Report of an Officer, with respect to those
          matters reported therein which that Officer is required by
          law to report, shall be afforded the strongest evidentary
          weight.  Evidence of this nature shall be determinative in
          the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the
          contrary.

      (b) No challenge to the published Report of an Officer, with
          respect to those matters reported therein which that Officer
          is required by law to report, shall proceed unless:
          (1) it was been initiated within 21 days of the publication
              of that report; or
          (2) credible evidence that the Officer acted in bad faith,
              or acted in good faith upon information presented to em

          Order, e shall do so within seven days of when the
          requirement arises.

      (b) The foregoing does not apply to any requirement to execute a
          Payment Order for zero units of any Currency.  Such Payment
          Orders need not be executed, any Rule to the contrary
          notwithstanding.
