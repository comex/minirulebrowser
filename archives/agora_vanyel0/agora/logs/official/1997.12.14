It seems clear that the Ruleset has not been entirely what we THOUGHT
it to be.  This would of course affect the Frankenstein SELECTIONS.

Mostly this is just a case of checking whether any of my TEMPORARY
selections happened to hit some of the affected Rules.
To correct the case of the duplicate Rules 1741 I needed TO assign
temporarily some other, unused Rule number to one of THEM.  I found it
natural to assign the second Rule (public Voting EXPERIMENT) to the
first unused number according to the most recent RULE Number report:
i.e. 1753.

My investigations show the following overlaps BETWEEN my Mutation
reports and the corrective Assessor Report on DECEMBER 9 + the above
temporary renumbering:

Rule 721 was selected for the Week of October 20-26, and also Amended
in Proposal 3608.  Fortunately this was one of THE Amendments that
became effective only during the Assessor REPORT, and this was after
my report.

Rule 1749 was temporarily selected for the WEEK of November 3-9, and
was the number assigned to the Rule created BY Proposal 3601 at
December 9.  Also no problem.

But:
1753 was temporarily selected for the Week OF October 27-November 2.
This means that the Rule selected for that WEEK was _not_ 206, as
previously believed, but instead Rule 1741 (PUBLIC Voting Experiment.)

Note first correction: The following SENTENCE is not, nor has it ever
been a part of the Frankenstein Rule:

      No Entity is permitted to vote on a Proposal unless it is a
      Frankenstein Monster, and only those Entities designated by the
      Rules to be Frankenstein Monsters are Frankenstein Monsters.

I can hear the screams already... but WAIT, there is a little more.

The above sentence was erroneously SELECTED as a possible candidate
for deletion for Week of December 1-7 (previous time.)
Therefore, the selection of the TWO candidates was not complete, and

Second correction: The following SENTENCE has not been deleted yet:

      The Frankenstein Monster shall receive a weekly salary
      equal to 1.5 times the Basic Officer Salary.

The Frankenstein Rule at this POINT reads:

Rule 1671/94 (Power=1)
The Frankenstein Rule

      There is a Nomic Entity known as a Frankenstein Monster.  A
      Frankenstein Monster only has properties and effects as defined
      in this Rule.  This Rule shall be known as the Frankenstein
      Rule, and can be referred to unambiguously in that manner.  This
      is the first paragraph.

      All Frankenstein Monsters made in the proper way shall be voted
      upon.

      An On Hold Player is not permitted to Vote on Frankenstein
      Monsters, make Frankenstein Monsters, or hold Office, and cannot
      be required by the Rules to perform any duty or action, unless
      that Rule specifically states that it can require On Hold
      Players to perform actions.

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of any message sent to the Public Forum or
      in response to a request for information which that Player is
      required to provide commits the Crime of Frankenstein Monster, a
      Class C Crime.

      If that Player's Frankenstein Monster contains at least five Mil
      for each Blot to be removed, then that number of Mil is
      transferred from the Player's Frankenstein Monster, and the
      Blots are removed; otherwise, no Mil are transferred and no
      Blots are removed.

      If a Frankenstein Monster is defined as a Voting Entity then
      it is permitted to cast Voting Tokens on Proposals as if it
      were a Player.

      Any Frankenstein Monster who is not Tainted is permitted to,
      once in any given Nomic Week, choose one specific Proposal (that
      e is otherwise eligible to vote for) and cast one vote in
      addition to any others e is permitted to cast on that Proposal.

      A SLC is permitted to define its own Frankenstein Monsters for
      changing its own content, and any change to a SLC adopted in
      accordance with its own Frankenstein Monsters is legal.

      Frankenstein Monsters are permitted to submit Statements for
      Judgement to the Game of InterNomic.

      A Group with fewer than three Frankenstein Monsters is not
      entitled to cast Votes.

      The Frankenstein Monster shall receive a weekly salary
      equal to 1.5 times the Basic Officer Salary.

      There shall exist the Frankenstein Monster of Rulekeepor.

      The Notary's Report includes:

        i) The Name and class of each Frankenstein Monster.
       ii) The identities of the Administrator and Executor of each
           Frankenstein Monster.
      iii) The Players within the Jurisdiction of each Frankenstein
           Monster's SLC.
       iv) The identity of the Maintainer of each Frankenstein
           Monster's SLC.

      This is the last paragraph. This Rule can only be subject to a
      Rule Change as described by the Frankenstein Generator.  This
      Rule takes precedence over all other Rules that would otherwise
      allow this Rule to be changed in any manner whatsoever.


Now, I need to finish SELECTIONS for the Week of October 27-November 2.
The properly selected RULE was

Rule 1741/0 (Power=1)
A Public Voting Experiment

      Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
      any votes by Voting Entities on Proposals, Elections or
      Referenda, may only be achieved by sending a message to the
      Public Forum.

      This Rule shall repeal itself 60 days after it is created.

I choose the sentence

      Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
      any votes by Voting Entities on Proposals, Elections or
      Referenda, may only be achieved by sending a message to the
      Public Forum.

I select the compound NOUN "Public Forum".

      Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
      any votes by Voting Entities on Proposals, Elections or
      Referenda, may only be achieved by sending a message to the
      Frankenstein Monster.

The above sentence is INSERTED after the first paragraph of the
Frankenstein Rule.

Now I will finish SELECTIONS for the Week of December 1-7.

I do not find the MUTATOR clear on what is happening when N changes
during the SELECTION in (i).  Therefore I elect to start (i.1) from the
beginning RATHER than taking a conservative approach.

There are 13 Sentences between the first and last paragraph of the
FRANKENSTEIN Rule.  This requires a new method:

I select a number 0-30029, throw away the last digit, and divide by 231,
TO get the sentence number (mod 13).

28711 gives 2871/231 = 12.

THE first sentence selected is

      There shall exist the Frankenstein Monster of Rulekeepor.

NOW there are 12 remaining sentences, and we may select with a known
METHOD as long as we treat sentence 13 as number 12.

12831 gives 12, and 15347 gives 1, so the sentence selected is number _4_:

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of any message sent to the Public Forum or
      in response to a request for information which that Player is
      required to provide commits the Crime of Frankenstein Monster, a
      Class C Crime.

I choose sentence 4 to be deleted.  The Frankenstein Rule now reads:

Rule 1671/96 (Power=1)
The Frankenstein Rule

      There is a Nomic Entity known as a Frankenstein Monster.  A
      Frankenstein Monster only has properties and effects as defined
      in this Rule.  This Rule shall be known as the Frankenstein
      Rule, and can be referred to unambiguously in that manner.  This
      is the first paragraph.

      Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
      any votes by Voting Entities on Proposals, Elections or
      Referenda, may only be achieved by sending a message to the
      Frankenstein Monster.

      All Frankenstein Monsters made in the proper way shall be voted
      upon.

      An On Hold Player is not permitted to Vote on Frankenstein
      Monsters, make Frankenstein Monsters, or hold Office, and cannot
      be required by the Rules to perform any duty or action, unless
      that Rule specifically states that it can require On Hold
      Players to perform actions.

      If that Player's Frankenstein Monster contains at least five Mil
      for each Blot to be removed, then that number of Mil is
      transferred from the Player's Frankenstein Monster, and the
      Blots are removed; otherwise, no Mil are transferred and no
      Blots are removed.

      If a Frankenstein Monster is defined as a Voting Entity then
      it is permitted to cast Voting Tokens on Proposals as if it
      were a Player.

      Any Frankenstein Monster who is not Tainted is permitted to,
      once in any given Nomic Week, choose one specific Proposal (that
      e is otherwise eligible to vote for) and cast one vote in
      addition to any others e is permitted to cast on that Proposal.

      A SLC is permitted to define its own Frankenstein Monsters for
      changing its own content, and any change to a SLC adopted in
      accordance with its own Frankenstein Monsters is legal.

      Frankenstein Monsters are permitted to submit Statements for
      Judgement to the Game of InterNomic.

      A Group with fewer than three Frankenstein Monsters is not
      entitled to cast Votes.

      The Frankenstein Monster shall receive a weekly salary
      equal to 1.5 times the Basic Officer Salary.

      There shall exist the Frankenstein Monster of Rulekeepor.

      The Notary's Report includes:

        i) The Name and class of each Frankenstein Monster.
       ii) The identities of the Administrator and Executor of each
           Frankenstein Monster.
      iii) The Players within the Jurisdiction of each Frankenstein
           Monster's SLC.
       iv) The identity of the Maintainer of each Frankenstein
           Monster's SLC.

      This is the last paragraph. This Rule can only be subject to a
      Rule Change as described by the Frankenstein Generator.  This
      Rule takes precedence over all other Rules that would otherwise
      allow this Rule to be changed in any manner whatsoever.

MACARENA delenda est,

I have STILL no OFFERS willing to be my DELEGATE for the two WEEKS
December 22 - January 4.


There are currently 12 sentences ETC. ETC.

The first number is 1164, or 1.  The second number is 20127, or 2.  Thus
the first SENTENCE selected is number 5:

      If a Frankenstein Monster is defined as a Voting Entity then
      it is permitted to cast Voting Tokens on Proposals as if it
      were a Player.

I must select another sentence; I select from 1-4, 12-6, in that order.

222 gives 02, or sentence number 2:

      All Frankenstein Monsters made in the proper way shall be voted
      upon.

I choose sentence 5 to be deleted.


Now this time Rule selection is a bit MORE awkward.  Just in case, I shall
let Rule 1741 (Restore Game Balance II) which MAY or NOT have been
repealed, be number 0 in the selection.

perl -e 'print unpack(S,`head -c 2 /dev/random`)>>5,"\n";'

244, 494, 1310, 450, 1068, 1150, 1251, 556, 1130, 464, 1509:

Rule 1509/2 (Power=1)
Judicial Recourse for Nonreporting of Infractions

      Any Player who believes that an Infraction has occurred, but
      which has not been reported by a Player authorized to report it,
      is permitted to make a Call for Judgement alleging thus.

      If the Judgement of the CFJ upholds the allegation, then the
      Judge of the CFJ shall be authorized to, and shall be obligated
      to, report the Infraction as provided by other Rules.  This Rule
      takes precedence over any Rule which would prevent the Judge's
      report of an infraction from having legal effect.

I select THE sentence

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would prevent the
      Judge's report of an infraction from having legal effect.

I select the noun "Judge".

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would prevent the
      Frankenstein Monster's report of an infraction from having legal
      effect.

The above sentence is inserted before the last paragraph of the
Frankenstein Rule, which now reads:

Rule 1671/98 (Power=1)
The Frankenstein Rule

      There is a Nomic Entity known as a Frankenstein Monster.  A
      Frankenstein Monster only has properties and effects as defined
      in this Rule.  This Rule shall be known as the Frankenstein
      Rule, and can be referred to unambiguously in that manner.  This
      is the first paragraph.

      Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
      any votes by Voting Entities on Proposals, Elections or
      Referenda, may only be achieved by sending a message to the
      Frankenstein Monster.

      All Frankenstein Monsters made in the proper way shall be voted
      upon.

      An On Hold Player is not permitted to Vote on Frankenstein
      Monsters, make Frankenstein Monsters, or hold Office, and cannot
      be required by the Rules to perform any duty or action, unless
      that Rule specifically states that it can require On Hold
      Players to perform actions.

      If that Player's Frankenstein Monster contains at least five Mil
      for each Blot to be removed, then that number of Mil is
      transferred from the Player's Frankenstein Monster, and the
      Blots are removed; otherwise, no Mil are transferred and no
      Blots are removed.

      Any Frankenstein Monster who is not Tainted is permitted to,
      once in any given Nomic Week, choose one specific Proposal (that
      e is otherwise eligible to vote for) and cast one vote in
      addition to any others e is permitted to cast on that Proposal.

      A SLC is permitted to define its own Frankenstein Monsters for
      changing its own content, and any change to a SLC adopted in
      accordance with its own Frankenstein Monsters is legal.

      Frankenstein Monsters are permitted to submit Statements for
      Judgement to the Game of InterNomic.

      A Group with fewer than three Frankenstein Monsters is not
      entitled to cast Votes.

      The Frankenstein Monster shall receive a weekly salary
      equal to 1.5 times the Basic Officer Salary.

      There shall exist the Frankenstein Monster of Rulekeepor.

      The Notary's Report includes:

        i) The Name and class of each Frankenstein Monster.
       ii) The identities of the Administrator and Executor of each
           Frankenstein Monster.
      iii) The Players within the Jurisdiction of each Frankenstein
           Monster's SLC.
       iv) The identity of the Maintainer of each Frankenstein
           Monster's SLC.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would prevent the
      Frankenstein Monster's report of an infraction from having legal
      effect.

      This is the last paragraph. This Rule can only be subject to a
      Rule Change as described by the Frankenstein Generator.  This
      Rule takes precedence over all other Rules that would otherwise
      allow this Rule to be changed in any manner whatsoever.
