The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of
a VOC directive was the report published in the PF on 1996/08/13
(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

AFAIK, no Herald's Report has ever been successfully ratified.

Text of Undistributed Proposals (not a distribution)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Swann) AI = 1
Revamp New Player Incentives.

Rule 1677 is amended to read as follows;

     Upon commencement of a new Player's Grace period, the Registrar 
     shall pay out to that Player 3 VTs and 1 P-Note.

{Comment: Followed Oerjan's suggestion, giving newbies a Blot amnesty
          rather than an Indulgence.  Note, I lowered the award.}
          

Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: Blot Amnesty During the Grace Period)

     If a Player is subject to an Infraction during eir Grace period, e 
     shall not be billed any Indulgences due to that Infraction.  This 
     Rule takes precedence over any Rule that would require or permit 
     that Player to be billed for those Indulgences.

     If the Rules specify a Player receive a specific number of Blots* 
     and those Blots are not the result of a Crime* and those Blots are 
     to be applied during that Player's Grace period, then those Blots 
     shall not be applied. This Rule takes precedence over any Rule that 
     would require or permit that Player to receive those Blots.

{Comment: Instead of giving the new Player an Indulgence, this makes 
          them partially immune to Blots* with the exception of Crimes, 
          which are a rare and grave matter.}


Rule 1701 is amended by deleting the following phrase;

     "Whenever a Player registers who has never before possessed any
      P-Notes, the Promotor shall pay out 5 P-Notes to that Player."

{Comment: Moved it to 1677.}


Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: Grace Period Proposals)

     If a Proposal has been submitted by a Player during eir Grace 
     Period then that Proposal shall have an initial Priority of one.  
     This Rule takes precedence over Rules that specify a different 
     initial Priority.

Rule 1442 is amended to read as follows;

      As soon as possible after the end of the Voting Period of a
      given Proposal, the Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity a
      number of Voting Tokens equal to the votes cast on that
      Proposal by that entity.

      However, If the votes were cast by a Player during eir Grace 
      period, then the Assessor shall instead bill that Player a number 
      of Voting Tokens equal to half the votes cast by that Player.

{Comment: These are both intended to serve the same purpose as giving a
          newbie some starting currency, without flooding the market 
          with VTs and P-Notes.  Also, a shrewd newbie has the 
          opportunity to raise capital by selling eir cheaper actions at 
          a profit.}

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Swann) AI = 1
Repeal a Pointless Rule

Rule 1692 is hereby Repealed.

{Comment: Does anyone believe that a Power one rule can effectively
restrict the Power of any Rule with Higher Precedence?}

Let the following Rule be created;
(Title:Minimum Power of Rules}

     All Rules shall have a Power of one or greater.  No Rule shall have 
     a Power less than one.  This Rule takes precedence over all other 
     Rules.

{Comment: This should be (more) effective.}

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Swann) AI = 1
Ratification and Reporting Tweaks

NOTE: What this does is attempt to smooth out a lot of nasty confusions 
in the Ratification process.  Because of a number of authors over the 
past couple of years, some ambiguity and a few outright contradictions 
crept in.  I've fixed the following; The Official Report/Officer's 
Report/Official Document confusion.  There are now Officer's Reports, 
which are Official Documents, and Official Documents, which are defined 
broadly by 1552.  I've also rewritten the rules to allow mechanisms 
other than proposals to Ratify Documents, permitting Ratification w/o 
Objection to actually work.


Rule 1686 is amended to read as follows;

      For each Office, the Rules may designate a set of information to
      be the corresponding Officer's Report.  All such Reports are
      Official Documents.  The only information that is part of an
      Officer's Report is that which the Rules specifically state is
      part of that Officer's Report.

      The holder of an Office for which there is an Officer's Report
      shall maintain all information in the Report, and shall post it
      to the Public Forum at least once every Nomic Week.  Failure to
      post the Officer's Report is the Infraction of Failure to Report,
      the penalty for which is the same as the penalty for a Class D
      Crime.  The Registrar and the Speaker are authorized to detect
      and report commissions of this Infraction.


Let the following Rule be Created;
(Title: Initiation and Execution of Ratification)

     Whenever an Official Document is Ratified, there is a time at which 
     the Ratification is Initiated, and a time the Ratification is 
     Executed.

     In the case of Ratification Without Objection, the Ratification is 
     Initiated when the appropriate Officer posts the intent to Ratify 
     in the Public Forum, and the Ratification is Executed when the 
     appropriate Officer makes a valid (as defined in other Rules) post 
     that the Ratification has been made.

     In the case of a Ratification by Proposal, the Ratification is 
     Initiated when the Proposal to Ratify is submitted to the Promotor, 
     and it is Executed when that Proposal is passed.

     If other Rules define alternative methods of Ratifying Official 
     Documents, they must define when Ratifications via those methods 
     are Initiated and Executed, otherwise those methods cannot be used 
     to Ratify any Official Documents.  This Rule takes precedence over 
     any Rule that contradicts its provisions.

     When a Ratification is Executed, the Execution is successful 
     and the Document is Ratified, if, and only if, the Official 
     Document it specifies is still one that is legally valid for 
     Ratification upon such Execution.


Rule 1552 is amended to read as follows;

      In order for an Official Document to be valid for the purpose of
      a Ratification, it must satisfy all the following criteria at
      the time Ratification is Initiated:

           i) The Rules require some specific Player to produce and/or
              maintain the document.
          ii) The Rules required it to be published in the Public
              Forum.  (A requirement that it be sent to all Players
              fulfills this criteria.)
         iii) It is not currently subject to a Claim of Error. (COE)
          iv) It is not currently subject to a pending Call for
              Judgement (CFJ), or a pending Appeal of a CFJ.
           v) The information within the Document has not been
              superseded by a subsequent Document.
          vi) The Document is not the Ruleset. The Ruleset is
              specifically excluded from Ratification.

      Further, a Document can become invalid before Ratification is
      Executed if any of the following occurs before that time:

           i) The Document is superseded by a subsequent Document
              which contradicts the information in the prior Document.
              This does not apply if there is a COE alleging the
              contradiction is an error, and the error is admitted
              before the end of the Proposal's Voting Period.
          ii) A COE is made on the Document, and the COE has not been
              denied before the end of the Proposal's Voting
              Period.
         iii) The Document becomes subject to a pending CFJ or a
              pending appeal of a CFJ.

       If, before a Ratification of a Document is Executed, another
       Document is issued that does not contradict the prior Document, 
       it does not alter the validity of the prior Document.


Rule 1550 is amended to read as follows;

     Ratification of an Official Document shall only be Executed if the 
     Ratification was Initiated via procedures explicitly defined in the 
     Rules and the Ratification explicitly specified a valid Official 
     Document it Ratifies.

     It shall always be permissible to Ratify any valid Official 
     Document by the operation of an adopted Proposal.

     This Rule takes precedence over any rule that would allow a 
     Ratification to be executed in contradiction of its requirements.


Rule 1551 is amended to read as follows;

      Sucessful Execution of a Ratification of an Official Document
      conforms the Game State to what it would be if the valid Official 
      Document thus ratified was completely true and accurate at the 
      time of the Document's publication in the Public Forum.  In other 
      words, the State of the Game, upon such Execution, becomes that
      specified within the Document, plus all subsequent legal changes 
      between the time of its publication and its Ratification was 
      Executed.

      All Game State changes due to the ratification of an Official
      Document occur at the time of such Execution; no retroactive
      effect is expressed or implied.

      A Document, once ratified, is for all legal purposes a true and
      accurate report.  The Game State it references may not be
      retroactively modified prior to the time it was published in the
      Public Forum, even to reflect a prior mistake, retracted or
      illegal move, or an Order.  This Rule takes precedence over
      any Rule that would allow such retroactive alterations or
      corrections to the Game State.

      In no way does the ratification of a Document invalidate,
      reverse, alter or cancel any prior moves or transfers, even
      unrecorded or overlooked ones.  Nor does the ratification of a
      Document change the legality or illegality of any prior move.
      Ratification only adjusts the actual Game State to conform to
      that perceived by the Players and Officers in Official
      Documentation.

      After Ratification of a Document is sucessfully Executed, the
      Player in charge of maintaining that Document shall annotate all 
      subsequent publications of that Document with the date of 
      publication of the last such publication that was ratified..

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Swann) AI = 1
Allow Dynamic and/or Conditional AI's

Rule 594 is amended by changing the words,
     "requested by its Proposer (if any)"
to read,
     "specified in the Proposal (if any)"

{Comment: A minor change, but allows a proposal to be conditional--ie. 
          "The AI of this Proposal is 3 if the Voting Index it achieves 
          is greater than three, and 1 otherwise."}

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Swann) AI = 1
We Know when the ROM Submits the @#$!% Proposal

Rule 1753 is amended by deleting the following paragraph;

     "For the purpose of the Rules governing Proposals, it shall be
      deemed that The Repeal-O-Matic Rule has submitted its Proposal
      concerning a given Rule immediately after the Promotor makes the
      selection of that Rule."

{Comment: The ROM Rule has been amended to have the Promotor explicitly
          submit the ROM's Proposals to the PF, a much more natural time 
          of submission.}

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Repeal-O-Matic) AI = 1
Repeal Rule 113 (Players may always opt out)

Rule 113 is hereby Repealed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Repeal-O-Matic) AI = 1
Repeal Rule 1692 (Power of Rules)

Rule 1692 is hereby Repealed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Repeal Rule 1829 (Refusal of Duty by the Speaker)

Rule 1829 is hereby Repealed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Repeal-O-Matic) AI = 1
Repeal Rule 1543 (The Wizard)

Rule 1543 is hereby Repealed.
Rule 1542 is hereby Repealed.
Rule 1682 is hereby Repealed.
Rule 1784 is amended by deleting the paragraph:
     "Whenever a Player gains three style points for a Proposal, e
      shall gain two Points.  The Wizard must order this Score change."

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Steve) AI = 1
Tweak the Taxation Rules

[Comment: two minor fixes to the taxation Rules. The first changes the
definition of 'in circulation' to exclude Currency already owed to the
Bank (this fixes the bug which would otherwise require the Accountor to
Levy Taxes, after e has just done so, but before any taxes have been paid).
The second lifts the requirement that the taxation POs actually be made
in the same message as the taxation announcement, and removes the silly
requirement that the Accountor tax the Bank. As a bonus, I include the
repeal of R1838 (Tabula Rasa), which should have been provided with an
auto-repeal mechanism, but wasn't due to an oversight on my part.]

Be it hereby resolved that R1852 (Circulation of Voting Tokens) be
amended by replacing in it the text which currently reads:

      An amount of Currency is in circulation if it exists and is not
      possessed by the Bank. 

with text which reads:

      The amount of a Currency in circulation is the amount of that
      Currency possessed by entities other than the Bank, minus the 
      total of the undisputed Payment Orders for that Currency naming
      entities other than Bank as payor, and the Bank as payee.

Be it further resolved that R1853 (Levying Taxes) be amended by replacing
in it the text which currently reads:

      Finally, the announcement must contain Payment Orders naming
      each entity in possession of the named Currency as payor, and
      with the Bank as payee, for an amount of the named Currency
      equal to the amount of the levy.

with text which reads:

      As soon as possible after making the announcement, the
      Accountor is required to execute Payment Orders naming each
      entity other than the Bank in possession of the named Currency
      as payor, and with the Bank as payee, for an amount of the
      named Currency equal to the amount of the levy. 

Be it further resolved that R1838 (Tabula Rasa) be repealed.

Repeal Rule 1855 (Plots)

Rule 1855 is hereby Repealed.

Proposal 3771 (Steve) AI = 1
Tweak the Taxation Rules

[Comment: two minor fixes to the taxation Rules. The first changes the
definition of 'in circulation' to exclude Currency already owed to the
Bank (this fixes the bug which would otherwise require the Accountor to
Levy Taxes, after e has just done so, but before any taxes have been paid).
The second lifts the requirement that the taxation POs actually be made
in the same message as the taxation announcement, and removes the silly
requirement that the Accountor tax the Bank. As a bonus, I include the
repeal of R1838 (Tabula Rasa), which should have been provided with an
auto-repeal mechanism, but wasn't due to an oversight on my part.]

Be it hereby resolved that R1852 (Circulation of Voting Tokens) be
amended by replacing in it the text which currently reads:

      An amount of Currency is in circulation if it exists and is not
      possessed by the Bank. 

with text which reads:

      The amount of a Currency in circulation is the amount of that
      Currency possessed by entities other than the Bank, minus the 
      total of the undisputed Payment Orders for that Currency naming
      entities other than Bank as payor, and the Bank as payee.

Be it further resolved that R1853 (Levying Taxes) be amended by replacing
in it the text which currently reads:

      Finally, the announcement must contain Payment Orders naming
      each entity in possession of the named Currency as payor, and
      with the Bank as payee, for an amount of the named Currency
      equal to the amount of the levy.

with text which reads:

      As soon as possible after making the announcement, the
      Accountor is required to execute Payment Orders naming each
      entity other than the Bank in possession of the named Currency
      as payor, and with the Bank as payee, for an amount of the
      named Currency equal to the amount of the levy. 

Be it further resolved that R1838 (Tabula Rasa) be repealed.
