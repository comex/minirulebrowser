   3775 Swann          1 Ratification and Reporting Tweaks

Style Change: -1

Some loose language in the amendment to R1552 is my main concern.
Firstly, it's not clear what it means for information in a Report to be
'superseded'. Secondly, there is a reference in the second half of the
Rule to "the Proposal's Voting Period" where no Proposal has been
specified.

   3776 Repeal-O-Matic 1 Repeal Rule 1747 (Pardoning Lawlessness)

Style Change: 0

ROM Proposal.

   3777 Blob           1 A collection of small fixes.

Style Change: +1

Three nice ideas.

Crime.  I plead no contest and will not appeal the Judge's verdict on
the matter. I only hope is that the Agora public will recognize this as
a genuine accident and not a willful and hypocritical flouting of the
principles I've been wont to expouse.

I got my disqualified list wrong in the above.  It was Harlequin who
has requested to be disqualified, not Macross. 

Re-arranging the list of eligibile Players, and keeping the same roll,
of the dice, the fates end up selecting lee instead. 

Attached is the corrected case-sheet.

Michael.

                               CFJ 1101

  emself ineligible to Judge a CFJ which has already been called.

  Called by Steve, Fri, 24 Jul 1998 16:37:14 +1000
  Assigned to Kolja A., as of this message

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

I begin with the general observation that being eligible to Judge a CFJ
is a Nomic property of Players in the sense of R1011, and hence can only
be changed by procedures specified in the Rules. Hence if the procedure
described in R1567 for changing one's eligibility to Judge a CFJ does
not permit Players to make themselves ineligible to Judge CFJs which
have not yet been called (as I contend), then, since no other Rule
specifies such a procedure, that action is simply not permitted by the
Rules at all, and the Statement is TRUE.

The first paragraph of R1567 itself states that:

      A Player makes emself ineligible to be the Judge of a specific CFJ
      by transmitting a notice to the Clerk of the Courts, specifying
      the CFJ for which e wishes to be made ineligible.

Attention should be drawn here to two points about this paragraph. The
first is that it describes a procedure for making oneself ineligible to
Judge 'a specific CFJ'. The second point is that the procedure described
requires the the Player to specify 'the CFJ for which e wishes to be
made ineligible'. I submit that a CFJ which has not yet been called and
hence does not yet exist cannot meet the requirements of specificity in
R1567. "All CFJs called in the next two weeks" does not name a specific
CFJ, for example. Neither does "Any CFJ called by Chuck in the next
month." Even "Any CFJ called by Chuck in the next three days concerning
the interpretation of Rule 1567" does not, I claim, name a specific CFJ,
even if Chuck actually makes a CFJ matching that description. 'A
specific CFJ' can only refer to a CFJ which already exists in the full
particularity of its details: its text, who called it, and when it was
called.

  Published, as of this message

======================================================================

Judgement: TRUE

Reasons and arguments:

The question is not new to me; the practice of making oneself
ineligible to judge all CFJs called in a certain period of time has
always struck me as against the letter of rule 1567. This never
bothered me very much, as I think it is nice to have this
possibility. I consider this an interesting example where game custom
quietly accepted a practice that is against the letter of a rule; I
think that a challenge of such custom in a CFJ is enough reason to
change it and go back to the rules proper.

I hope, however, that noone will advocate changes in past CFJ
assignments that respected ineligibilities illegal under this
CFJ. Anyone who thinks about doing so should have formally challenged
the practice when it was begun.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

I begin with the general observation that being eligible to Judge a CFJ
is a Nomic property of Players in the sense of R1011, and hence can only

The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of
a VOC directive was the report published in the PF on 1996/08/13
(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

AFAIK, no Herald's Report has ever been successfully ratified.

Text of Undistributed Proposals (not a distribution)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Swann) AI = 1
Allow Dynamic and/or Conditional AI's

Rule 594 is amended by changing the words,
     "requested by its Proposer (if any)"
to read,
     "specified in the Proposal (if any)"

{Comment: A minor change, but allows a proposal to be conditional--ie. 
          "The AI of this Proposal is 3 if the Voting Index it achieves 
          is greater than three, and 1 otherwise."}

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Repeal-O-Matic) AI = 1
Repeal Rule 1855 (Plots)

Rule 1855 is hereby Repealed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Repeal-O-Matic) AI = 1
Repeal Rule 1630 (Impersonation)
This Proposal shall have an AI = 1

Rule 1630 is hereby Repealed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Blob) AI = 1
Use it or lose it.

Create a Rule, entitled "Use it or Lose it", with text:

      If, at the end of the month, a Player who has been Active
      for that whole month has not voted on any Proposals 
      distributed that month, then the Assessor shall deny voting
      Privileges to that Player, for two weeks.

Amend Rule 879/6 (Power=1)
Quorum

      Quorum for a Proposal is achieved if a vote is cast on that
      Proposal by one-third of Active Players not denied voting 
      privileges, or one-fifth of all Players, whichever is greater.

      Quorum for a Proposal is calculated using the number of
      Registered Players, and their Hold statuses (On or Off), at the
      beginning of the prescribed Voting Period for that Proposal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Blob) AI = 1
Skimming a bit off the top.

Amend rule 1449 ("The Assessor") to read:

      There shall exist the Office of Assessor.  The Assessor
      shall receive a weekly salary equal to 0.5 times the Basic
      Officer Salary.

      The Assessor shall also receive a Commission. At the end
      of the Voting Period for a Proposal, the Assessor shall
      pay out to emself an amount equal to 5% of the VTs spent
      on voting on that Proposal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Blob) AI = 1
The Voting Tariff

Crete a rule, entitled "The Voting Tariff", with text:

      The Voting Tariff is a number of VTs, a multiple of the
      MUQ, between 0.5 and 2.0 inclusive. Unless the Rules give
      it another value, the Voting Tariff is 1 VT.

      The Assessor may change the value of the Voting Tariff by
      announcing the new value in the Public Forum, provided that
      e announces a value within the range proscribed above, that
      e makes the announcement prior to midnight GMT Thursday, and 
      that e has not already made such an announcement earlier in 
      the Week. The new value of the Voting Tariff does not take
      effect until the beginning of the Nomic Week after the
      change has been announced.

Amend rule Rule 1442 ("The Cost of Voting") to read:

      Proposals have a voting cost, equal to the Voting Tariff
      at the time they were distributed. If there was no value
      set for the Voting Tariff at that time, then the voting
      cost is 1 VT.

      As soon as possible after the end of the Voting Period of a
      given Proposal, the Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity a
      number of Voting Tokens equal to the votes cast on that
      Proposal by that entity multiplied by the voting cost for
      that Proposal.

[Comment: Yet another parameter for the economy. Gives us a way 
 to handle voting slumps, like the present one, by making voting
 cheaper. But Votes are still valuable, because of the danger that
 prices will go up.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Steve) AI = 1
Extend the Secret Voting Experiment

[Comment: The secret voting experiment seems to be working reasonably
well. I'd like to extend it another two months. Note that this quite
independent of the issue of Presence.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rules 452 (Prohibit Electioneering by Vote
Collectors), 1625 (Secrecy of Votes) and 1764 (Public Voting) each be
amended by appending to them a paragraph which reads:

      This Rule, apart from this paragraph, has no effect. Two months
      after this paragraph is added to this Rule, this paragraph shall
      be deleted from this Rule.

Be it further resolved that R1859 (Secret Voting), be amended by
replacing in it the paragraph which currently reads:

      Two months after it is created, this Rule repeals itself.

with a paragraph which reads:

      Two months after this paragraph is added to this Rule, this Rule
      repeals itself.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Steve) AI = 1
Extend the ban on Presence

[Comment: despite the unhappiness of some Players with the absence of
Presence (to coin a phrase), I think its effects have been interesting,
even salutary, and that they warrant further investigation. I think it
too deserves a 2 month extension so we can see how much of our present
difficulties with Quorum (which I think have been overstated in any
case) are due to the ban on Presence, and how much to general summer
holiday inactivity.]

Be it hereby resolved that R1715 (Announcing One's Presence) be amended
by appending to it a paragraph which reads:

      This Rule, apart from this paragraph, has no effect. Two months
      after this paragraph is added to this Rule, this paragraph shall
      be deleted from this Rule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Repeal-O-Matic) AI = 2
Repeal Rule 1432 (Player Uniqueness)

Rule 1432 is hereby Repealed.
