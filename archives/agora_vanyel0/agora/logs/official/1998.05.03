Text of Adopted Proposals
======================================================================
Proposal 3736 (Blob) AI = 3
Fix the Proposal Queue

Amend Rule 106 ("Adopting Proposals") to read:

      All Proposals made and distributed in the proper way shall
      be voted upon.  A Proposal shall be adopted if and only if
      it receives the required number of votes and if Quorum is 
      achieved.

[Comment: Allows undistributed proposals to never be voted upon.]

======================================================================
Proposal 3737 (Swann) AI = 1
Riot Act

Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Inciting to Riot}

Any Player who is Rebellious continually for a period in excess of one
month shall be guilty of the Infraction of Inciting To Riot. This
Infraction shall be reported by the Registrar, and upon the report of
the Infraction the Player becomes Abiding.

The penalty for this Infraction shall be one Blot, plus one additional
Blot for each instance the player switched from Abiding to Rebellious
since the last Rebellion.

{Comment: Thinking thoughts about rebellion, it strikes me that the one
          reason that rebellion is so easy is because Players can be 
          rebellious effectively permanently.  (Players such as myself 
          :)  This rule forces a little cost into the Rebellion picture 
          without changing the mechanism.  (sort of a converse of the 
          Miscreant proposal.)}

======================================================================
Proposal 3739 (Swann) AI = 1
Power of Attorney

Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Granting Power of Attorney}

     Any Player who has been continuously registered for two or more 
     months is empowered to give another willing Player eir Power of 
     Attorney for a specified period of time.  The giving Player shall 
     be known, for this Rule, as the Grantor.  The receiving Player 
     shall be known, for this Rule, as the Holder.

     Power of Attorney is given by the Grantor posting in the Public 
     Forum, naming the Holder e is giving the Power of Attorney to, and 
     the time period for which the Power of Attorney shall given.  To be 
     effective, this post must name a time that begins within the week 
     following the posting. The Power of Attorney shall not be granted 
     unless the Holder is an active Player and consents in the Public 
     Forum before the beginning of the specified period of time.

     If the grant is effective, the Holder shall then have the Power of 
     Attorney beginning at the specified time.  This grant shall end 
     when one of the following occurs;

       i) The period specified expires.
      ii) The Grantor posts in the Public Forum that e is withdrawing 
          eir Power of Attorney.
     iii) The Grantor is deregistered, or goes On Hold.
      iv) The Holder is deregistered, or goes On Hold
       v) It has been over three months since the Grantor gave eir Power 
          of Attorney to the Holder.


Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Power of Attorney}

     In certain specified circumstances the Rules may grant one Player, 
     hereafter called the Holder, Power of Attorney for another Player, 
     hereafter called the Grantor.  Such a grant shall only occur when 
     specified by the Rules, and shall last only as long as the Rules 
     permit.

     When the Holder is granted Power of Attorney for the Grantor, that 
     means that the Holder becomes the sole Executor for the Grantor for 
     as long as e has that Power of Attorney.

     No Player is permitted to have Power of Attorney for more than two 
     other Players.
