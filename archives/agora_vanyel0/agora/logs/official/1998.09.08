(Caller's) Arguments:

The rule Rule 1837/0 (Power=1) does not mention a Revolt, just a
rebellion. Rule 1664/6 (Power=1)does not mention a Miscreant, but does
include a clear way to calculate the success of a revolt.

Evidence:

Rebellion

      Any Player is either Abiding or Rebellious. A new Player is
      always Abiding when e becomes a player. A Player can switch from
      Abiding to Rebellious or from Rebellious to Abiding by sending a
      message to the Public Forum saying e does change so. The
      Registrar shall maintain a list of all Players that are
      Rebellious. This list is known as the Red Pages, and is part of
      the Registrar's Report.

      A Player may Call for a Revolt at any time, by sending to the
      Public Forum saying e does so. A Call for Revolt is only
      effective if the following conditions are met:

         i) The player posting the Call is Rebellious,
        ii) No other effective Call for Revolt has been made that
            week,
       iii) A successful Revolt has not occurred for a month or more.

      As soon as possible after an effective Call for Revolt has been
      posted, the Registrar must determine whether the Revolt
      succeeds, as outlined below, and post the result to the Public
      Forum.

      The result of a Revolt is determined as follows: The Registrar
      selects a random integer from 1 to the number of Players at the
      time of the Call for Revolt. If this number is less than or
      equal to the number of Rebellious Players at the time of the
      Call for Revolt, then the Revolt succeeds, otherwise it fails.

      If a Revolt succeeds, then the following events occur (in
      order):

         - The Registrar shall vacate all Blots of each Rebellious
           Player.
         - The Registrar shall pay out 2 VT to each Rebellious
           Player.

         - A Speaker Transition occurs
         - All Players that hold one or more Offices in the normal
           fashion cease to hold those in a normal fashion and hold
           them temporarily instead.
         - All Rebellious Players become Abiding again

      If a Revolt does not succeed, then:

         - All Rebellious Players gain 2 Blots.
         - The Player who Called for Revolt gains 2 (additional) Blots

      The Registrar shall execute all Payment Orders required by this
      rule.

      The Registrar is authorised to vacate any payment orders this
      rule requires em to vacate.

Rule 1837/0 (Power=1)
The Miscreant

      Let there exist the Patent Title of "Miscreant".

      If any Player has more than ten Blots, the Player with the most
      Blots earns the Title of Miscreant.  If no Player has the most
      number of Blots, there is no Miscreant t.  The Miscreant loses
      eir Title of Miscreant if eir number of Blots drops below ten,
      if another Player gains as many Blots as em, or if another
      Player gains more Blots than em.

      A Player with the Title Miscreant counts as two Players towards
      the tally needed for Rebellion.  If a Rebellion occurs in which
      the Miscreant was a Rebel, the Title of Miscreant is revoked
      from the Miscreant.

                               CFJ 1104

  The presence in a Rule of deference clause, claiming that the Rule
  defers to another Rule, does not prevent a conflict with the other
  Rule arising, but shows only how the Rule says that conflict is to
  be resolved when it does arise.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

The Statement follows from two assumptions, both of which it would be
extremely difficult to reject.

1. The Mirror Image Assumption

Precedence and deference are converse relations, logical mirror images
of each other. This simply means that if A claims to take precedence
over B, then this is logically equivalent to B's claiming to defer to
A.

2. The Conflict Assumption

When A claims to take precedence over B, this does not prevent a
conflict between A and B arising. Rather we say that the conflict
exists, but is resolved in favour of A (other things being equal).

By the Conflict Assumption, precedence claims do not make conflicts
disappear, they just show how to resolve them when they arise. But by
the Mirror Image Assumption, the situation in which A claims to take
precedence over B is equivalent to one in which B claims to defer to
A.  So this situation too must be one in which the conflict is not
made to disappear. This what the Statement claims.

======================================================================

Motions

1. Motion to Annotate:

I hereby file a Motion with the Judge of the CFJ requesting that e
Order the Rulekeepor to Annotate Rule 1030 with a copy of the
Statement. -- Steve

  Published, as of this message

======================================================================

Judgement: TRUE

Reasons and arguments:

Whoa. I wish the Caller had been more precise in eir Statement - the
method Michael used when ? E's used a few different ones in the past.
I'm tempted to dismiss the Call on that ground, but I don't want to be
too much of a nitpicker, so for clarity's sake : I take the above as
referring to Michael's message relating to the determination of the
outcome in the Call for Revolt made this September 3d.

Michael indicated that e had used the following protocol to select a
number between 1 and 17 for the purposes of determining that outcome,
a selection which, being required to be a 'random' one falls under the
purview of Rule 1079 :

>To determine this in a verifiable way, I take the whole part of the
>Dow Jones closing price for yesterday and take the modulo of this
>number by 17 and then add one to get a number in the range 1 - 17.  I
>determine this method before calculating the result.

In the ensuing discussion, several flaws were pointed out in the
chosen method, some by Michael themselves; the apparent clincher,
however, being a statistical analysis provided by Player Steve
(chi-square test). Michael emself having declined to provide further
proof of the 'randomness' of eir method, in the sense of 1079, and
given the provision of 1079 which places the burden of proof upon the
Player using a given random selection method, I am required to enter a
Judgement of TRUE.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Since Michael did not announce in the public forum the method he was
using before the Dow Jones Closing price for yesterday, he could
looked up the Dow Jones Closing Price and could have tested the
results before announcing them. It is possible that if the results
were not as he had liked that he could have chosen some other
sufficiently published number, like the NYSE composite value, or the
Dow Jones Closing price to the second decimal Place, and tested it
until he came up with a method that seemed random, would be random if
chosen and announced in the public forum before the number was
available to calculate the result.
