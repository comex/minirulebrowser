  Judge FALSE, 12 Nov 1997 20:03:38 -0600

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Rule 1006: An Office must be held by a Player.
Rule 790:  The Winner of the Election shall hold the Office.

This is a conflict.  Rule 790 takes precedence, so Morendil (a non-Player)
holds the Office of Speaker-Elect.

Now:

Rule 1006: An Officer is a player holding an Office.

This is an explicit definition.  There is no conflict with any other Rule,
so the Office of Speaker-Elect is held by someone who is not an Officer
(Morendil).

Rule 790:  An Office is held in the normal fashion only if held by an
_Officer_ who was elected to it (among other things).

The Office of Speaker-Elect does not satisfy this requirement.  Therefore
it is not being held in the normal fashion.

======================================================================

Judge's Arguments:

Rule 1006 does clearly require an officer to be a Player. However,
as has been pointed out, it is trumped in ths case by 760. It remains
to be seen how this affects the readin of the rest of 760

An Office is "held in the normal fashion" if and only if the
      Officer holding that Office was elected to that Office and has
      neither resigned from it nor been retired or removed from it.
      An Office which is not held in the normal fashion is said to be
      held temporarily.

I must disagree that this directly requires an Office to be held
by an Officer to be held "in the normal fashion" It seems transparent
that this is simply an assumption made by the Rule, not aware of the
possible ramifications of the rest of the Rule. To interpret this
implicit assumption as imposing any sort of requirement is, in my
opinion, strained, particularly as the Rule still makes sense if
we read Officer in the sense of "person holding an Office" rather
than in the specialized sense used by 760, and since it is 760
itself that, elsewhere, defeats the definition that 1006 attempts to
impose. This interpretation does least violence to the Rule.

  "Rule 1558 prevents a Player who is the Speaker from nominating in an

======================================================================
Requested Injunction:

In case of a Judgement of TRUE, I request that the Judge issue
an Injunction requiring the Rulekeepor to annotate R1558 with
a copy of the Statement and the list of Relevant Rules.


======================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

I'll take the unusual step of presenting arguments for both sides. I'm
not really advocating any particular Judgement. I just think the matter
should be resolved one way or the other. I'll leave it to the Judge
to decide which e prefers. Perhaps the Judge will find some new
argument which I haven't thought of to resolve the matter.

R1647 states:

      The Speaker can never hold the Office of Speaker-Elect, even
      temporarily.

while R1558 states:

      No Player may be Nominated who would not be permitted to hold
      the Office which the Election is seeking to fill.

On the side of a Judgement of TRUE, we have the observation that
if a Player who is the Speaker were still to be Speaker when e
was Elected Speaker-Elected, e would not be permitted to hold the
Office, even temporarily. This seems to show that the Speaker
cannot nominate for Speaker-Elect.

On the other hand, however, how can we be sure that the Player
who is Speaker would still be Speaker when the Election for the
Office of Speaker-Elect concluded? If the Player had somehow
ceased to be Speaker, nothing would prevent em from holding the
Office of Speaker-Elect, were e to win the Election. And it is not
difficult to imagine ways in which the a Player who is the Speaker
might cease to be Speaker in time take up the Office of Speaker-Elect.
Here are three:

1. By proposal. From the call for Nominations to the announcement of
the results, an Election in which there are multiple Candidates takes
at least two weeks to complete. In that time, a high-Powered Rule
might be be adopted removing the Player from the position of Speaker.

2. By giving up the Speakership voluntarily. Although R681 prevents
a Speaker who gives up the Speakership voluntarily from nominating
emself for the Office of Speaker-Elect, the Rule does not say that
the Speaker may not already be nominated at the time e gives up
the Speakership.

3. By going On Hold. Eir doing so would constitute the Crime of
Speaker Inactivity (see R1375), with the quite heavy penalties
entailed by this, but that would not make em ineligible to hold the
Office of Speaker-Elect.

Whether the Judge finds these latter considerations persuasive will
largely depend on how e chooses to construct the phrase 'would not
be permitted to hold the Office'. If e chooses to read it 'would
*certainly* not be permitted to hold the Office', then I think a
Judgement of FALSE is indicated, since I think I've shown above
that we cannot be certain that a Player who is the Speaker would
not be permitted to hold the Office of Speaker-Elect were e Elected
to that Office. On the other hand, if e chooses to read it as 'would
not be permitted to hold the Office, other things being equal' then
a Judgement of TRUE is indicated, since all of the possibilites I've
raised fall into the category of other things not being equal.
