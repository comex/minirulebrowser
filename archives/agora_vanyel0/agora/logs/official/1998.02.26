======================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

The recent Revolt has brought to light an unclarity in the Rules
dealing with Speaker Taintedness which should be cleared up quickly.
I don't intend to argue for a Judgement of TRUE; I'll just bring the
issues before the Judge for eir consideration.

Rule 1648/2 (Power=1)
When the Speaker is Tainted

      The Speaker is Tainted whenever the Player who is Speaker became
      Speaker by any means other than a normal Speaker transition.

      A normal Speaker transition occurs whenever the Rules require
      the Speaker-Elect to become Speaker, and the Office of
      Speaker-Elect is held in normal fashion.

      If the Rules require the Speaker-Elect to become Speaker, and
      that Office is held temporarily, the Speaker-Elect still becomes
      Speaker, but the resulting Speaker is Tainted.

      A Tainted Speaker may remain Speaker only until some other
      Player holds the Office of Speaker-Elect in normal fashion, at
      which point, the Speaker-Elect shall become Speaker.

The first paragraph makes it clear that the question of whether
I am a Tainted Speaker is equivalent to the question of whether I
become Speaker by means of a normal Speaker Transition. It is this
which is unclear.

The second paragraph defines a normal Speaker Transition. Clearly,
the Rules - R1664 (Rebellion), to be exact - did require the
Speaker-Elect to become Speaker. At the time of the Revolt, I
did hold the Office of Speaker-Elect in the normal fashion, so
if we read the second paragraph as applying the test for holding
the Office in the normal fashion at the earliest time at which
the Rules required the Speaker-Elect to become Speaker, then I
became Speaker by means of a normal Speaker Transition and so
am not Tainted.

However, other times of applying the test are possible. R402
sets out the procedure which is to be followed when the Speaker-
Elect becomes Speaker, including the case where this happens
due to a Revolt:

     Whenever the Rules call for the Speaker-Elect to become Speaker:

       1) The Speaker shall forward copies of all necessary materials
          for the performance of eir position, as soon as possible to
          the Speaker-Elect.
       2) The Speaker-Elect shall acknowledge the receipt of said
          materials as soon as possible after step 1.
       3) As soon as possible after step 2, the Speaker shall post a
          message to the Public Forum announcing that the
          Speaker-Elect has become the Speaker.  At the "Date:" of
          the Speaker's posting, the old Speaker shall cease to be
          Speaker and the Speaker-Elect shall become the Speaker.

>From R402, we see that when a Revolt occurs, although the Rules
first begin to *require* that the Speaker-Elect become Speaker at
the time the Revolt occurs, the Speaker-Elect does not actually *become*
Speaker until step 3 of the Speaker Transition process is completed.
At that time, due to the Revolt itself, I did not hold the Office
of Speaker-Elect in the normal fashion, but rather held it temporarily.

This, then, is what the Judge must decide: does R1648 apply its test
for holding the Office of Speaker-Elect in the normal fashion at the
time that the Rules first require that the Speaker-Elect become Speaker
(in this case, at the time of the Revolt), or at the time that the
Speaker-Elect actually becomes Speaker, at the completion of step 3
of the Speaker Transition process?


======================================================================
Judge's Argument:

The relevant facts of the case are that:

   1.) On 13 February 1998 a Revolt occurred.
   2.) At that time, Morendil was Speaker and Steve held the Office of
        Speaker-Elect in the normal fashion.
   3.) Morendil initiated a Speaker Transition on 16 February, under
        Rule 402.
   4.) As a result of (3.), Steve became Speaker on 17 February.

Rule 1664 provides in part that "If a revolt occurs, then: - The
Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker [...]".   Thus at that time the requirements
of paragraph 2 of Rule 1648 were satisfied; namely

  (a.) the Rules required the Speaker-Elect to become Speaker,
  (b.) the Office of Speaker-Elect was held in normal fashion.

Thus according to that Rule, "a normal Speaker transition occurs."

The only Speaker Transition in sight is the one completed by Morendil on 17
February, as a result of which Steve became Speaker.  Thus the Speaker
Transition by which Steve became Speaker, was normal; and so Steve is not
Tainted.

Text of Adopted Proposals
======================================================================

Proposal 3693 (Steve)  AI = 2
Split the Assessor's functions

[Comment: a proto to split the two functions of the Assessor -tallying
votes and VT Recordkeeping -into two separate Offices. The major change
that this entails is to the way voting is handled. I've tried to keep
things as simple as possible, by loosening the link between voting and
spending VTs. Under the system I propose, voting results in being billed
for VTs, but voting is not a dual act of both casting a vote, and 
spending VTs accordingly. Compare my proposed R1442 to the current
version to see the advantages of this approach.] 

[Summary: this Proposal creates 1 Rule, repeals 2 Rules (1731, 1653), and
amends 6 Rules (1449, 1696, 1442, 206, 1717, 1547).]

This Proposal has an AI of 2.

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "The Accountor", be created
with the following text:

      There is an Office of Accountor, whose Salary is 1.5 times the
      Basic Officer Salary, and whose responsibility it is to be the 
      Recordkeepor for Voting Tokens. The Accountor's Report includes
      the number of Voting Tokens possessed by each entity which
      possesses them, and any changes thereto since the last posting
      of the Accountor's Report.

Be it further resolved that the Office of Accountor shall initially
be held by the Assessor.

Be it further resolved that R1449 (The Assessor) be amended by replacing
the text "3 times the Basic Officer Salary" with the text "1.5 times the
Basic Officer Salary".

Be it further resolved that R1696 (Voting Tokens) be amended to read:

      Voting Tokens (VTs) are a Currency.  The MUQ of VTs is 0.1.
      The Recordkeepor for VTs is the Accountor.  The Mintor of
      VTs is the Bank.

Be it further resolved that R1442 (Using VTs) have its Title changed
to 'Voting and Voting Tokens', and that it be amended to read:

      A Voting Entity votes upon a Proposal when, during the Voting 
      Period of that Proposal, e informs the Assessor of the vote or 
      votes e is casting upon that Proposal, provided that e is 
      authorized to vote on that Proposal. A Voting Entity may inform the 
      Assessor that e casts no votes on a Proposal, and doing so cancels 
      any votes e has previously cast on that Proposal, if this is done 
      during the Voting Period of that Proposal. Cancelled votes are not 
      counted by the Assessor and do not count towards Quorum.

      As soon as possible after the end of the Voting Period of a
      Proposal, the Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity one Voting
      Token for each uncancelled vote cast by that Voting Entity on
      that Proposal. In the case where a Voting Entity has cast more
      than one vote on a Proposal, or a Voting Entity has cast votes
      on more than one Proposal, the results of which the Assessor
      has published at the same time, the Assessor is permitted to
      bill the Voting Entity for an amount of Voting Tokens
      equivalent to all the uncancelled votes cast by the Voting
      Entity on those Proposals, instead of billing the Voting Entity
      once for each uncancelled vote e cast.

Be it further resolved that R1731 (Implicit Transfer Orders) be repealed.

[Comment: no longer needed.]

Be it further resolved that R206 (Voting Entities and Votes) be amended 
by deleting from it the text:

      The casting of any votes may only be achieved by the casting of 
      Voting Tokens, as specified in other Rules.

Be it further resolved that R1717 (The Senate) be amended by replacing
the text in which currently reads:

      If any Entity other than a Senator has already Voted on a
      Proposal by the time it becomes a Senate Proposal, their Votes
      on that Proposal change to ABSTAIN, and cannot change
      thereafter, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, and at the
      end of the Voting Period, the cost of casting those Votes is
      transferred to them.

with text which reads:

      If an Entity other than a Senator has already voted on a
      Proposal by the time it becomes a Senate Proposal, eir votes
      on that Proposal are cancelled.

Be it further resolved that R1653 (Groups and Unity Vote) be repealed.

[Comment: a rarely used white elephant not worth saving.]

Be it further resolved that R1547 (Some Organizations Can Cast VTs)
have its Title changed to "Some Organizations Can Vote" and that it
be amended to read: 

      If an Organization is a Voting Entity then it is permitted to
      cast votes on Proposals as if it were a Player. Such votes are
      cast by the Organization's Executor, acting on behalf of the
      Organization.

[Comment: Votes are cast; Voting Tokens are spent.]

======================================================================

Proposal 3693 (Time Agent)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
(Untitled)

Create a Rule titled "Proposal Passed By the Narrowest of
Margins" with the following text (delimited by rows of asterisks):

*********************************************************************

      A Proposal is considered to have passed by the narrowest of    
      margins when all of the following conditions are true:

      1) The Proposal has met the requirements established by other  
         Rules to be considered passed.
      2) If there had been 1 (one) less FOR vote (out of the total   
         number of FOR votes in the final tally) on this proposal,   
         it would not have passed or not met Quorum -- or both.
      3) There must have been at least 1 (one) AGAINST vote in the   
         final tally.

      As soon as possible after a Proposal has been determined to    
      have passed by the narrowest of margins, the Assessor shall pay
      out to that Proposal's Proposer an award of 3 (three) Voting   
      Tokens in addition to any other award that Player might also   
      receive for the passing of that Proposal.

I hereby call for Nominations for the newly created Office of
Accountor, a lovely job with a whopping 1.5 VTs salary, up there with
the Assessor, Promotor and Registrar.  (Below the Archivist, but
that's something that's a definite anomaly in my opinion.)

Michael.
