I order the Bank to pay Sherlock 1 VT for this Judgement.  -- elJefe

=====================================================================

                               CFJ 1084

     "Chuck did not commit the Infraction of Failure to Report at the
      end of the Nomic Week of Feb. 9, 1998."

======================================================================

Judge:       Sherlock
Judgement:   TRUE

Eligible:    Blob, Crito, elJefe, General Chaos, Harlequin, Jester, Kolja A.,
             Morendil, Murphy, Oerjan, Sherlock, Steve, Swann, Time Agent

Ineligible:
Caller:      Chuck
Barred:      Michael
On request:
On hold:


======================================================================
Injunction by Judge Sherlock:
  I order the Registrar to order the Bank to pay Chuck 2 Indulgences
and 2 VT's, if Chuck paid these same amounts to satisfy RIPO1 and RVTPO11.

======================================================================
History:

  Called by Chuck, 16 Feb 1998 15:44:51 -0600
  Assigned to Sherlock, 23 Feb 1998 12:54:00 +0000
  Judged TRUE, with Injunction, 26 Feb 1998 20:28:19 -0500


======================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

I sent the Short Logical Ruleset, which constitutes the Official
Report of the Rulekeepor, to agora-official prior to the end
of the Nomic Week.  However, it was not received by gecko until after
the end of the Nomic Week

Although it may be that a message sent to one of the PF listservs
does not take effect until it is received by the listserv, that
is irrelevant to the Infraction of Failure to Report, which requires
only that an Offical Report be "post[ed]" each Nomic Week.  I would
submit that the proper interpretation of "post" is synonymous
with "send", and I did send the SLR in the week in question.


======================================================================
Evidence provided by Caller:

1. headers from my post of the SLR, as received by Oerjan, excerpted
2. Rule 1686
3. Rule 1051

Rule 1686/0 (Power=1)
Official Reports

      For each Office, the Rules may designate a set of information to
      be the corresponding Officer's Report.  All such Reports are
      Official Reports.  The only information that is part of an
      Official Report is that which the Rules specifically state is
      part of that Official Report.

      The holder of an Office for which there is an Official Report
      shall maintain all information in the Report, and shall post it
      to the Public Forum at least once every Nomic Week.  Failure to
      post the Official Report is the Infraction of Failure to Report,
      the penalty for which is the same as the penalty for a Class D
      Crime.  The Registrar and the Speaker are authorised to detect
      and report commissions of this Infraction.

History:
Created by Proposal 2839 (Zefram), Mar. 11 1997


Rule 1051/11 (Power=1)
The Office of the Rulekeepor

      There shall exist the Office of Rulekeepor.  The Rulekeepor
      shall receive a weekly Salary equal to 2 times the Basic Officer
      Salary.

      The Rulekeepor shall maintain a complete list of all Rules.  The
      Short Logical Ruleset constitutes the Rulekeepor's Official
      Report. In addition, the Rulekeepor shall post the Full Logical
      Ruleset to the Public Forum at least once each month.

Judge's Arguments:

I have chosen not to include a Judge's Argument, as it does
not seem to be required and this issue seems pretty straightforward.

Buying points

Create a new rule with the Title "Buying points" and the text:

     Player may pay currencies to gain points. To do this, a player 
     must transfer the price for these points to the bank. This transfer
     may not have any other purpose. The price for any one point may
     only be paid using one single currency. As soon as possible after
     the transfer of the price, the Recordkeepor of the currency with
     which the price was paid must order the corresponding Points
     gain for the player who paid the price. 
   
     The price for one Point can be one of the following: one
     indulgence, three P-notes or three VTs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal 3700 (Swann)  AI = 1
Ratification w/o Objection

Let the following Rule Be created;
{Title: Ratification Without Objection)

     Any Officer who holds an Office in Normal Fashion can Ratify an 
     Official Report Without Objection, provided the following 
     conditions hold;

       i) The Report to be Ratified is one that is legally permissible 
          to Ratify.
      ii) The Report to be Ratified was produced by the Player holding 
          the Office.
     iii) The Report to be Ratified is one that is required to be 
          produced and maintained by the Officer.

     A Speaker who is not Tainted is permitted to Ratify any Official 
     Report Without Objection provided that the Report is one legally 
     permissible to Ratify.

     A COE on any Report undergoing this process shall be deemed by the
     Rules to constitute an Objection.

{Comment: Ratification, back when it was a VOC, wasn't intended to
          merely be disaster relief.  This Rule should help Officers use 
          Ratification without all the hurdles of the Proposal system.}

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal 3701 (Swann)  AI = 1

Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Proposal Applications}

     There is a type of Application known as an Proposal Application.  
     Such an Application is executed by submitting it to the Promotor.  
     This application takes effect when executed.  For a Proposal 
     Application to take effect it must;

       i) Indicate it is a Proposal Application
      ii) Include the text of a single Proposal, clearly indicated as 
          such.
     iii) Specify the non-player entity which the Rules shall deem to 
          have submitted the included Proposal.  This entity cannot be 
          an entity defined elsewhere in the Rules as a Proposing 
          Entity.
      iv) Include the signature of the Executor of the non-player entity 
          specified in iii) above. (A Proposal Application may never be 
          executed on behalf of an entity with no Executor.)
       v) Include the signature of at least one other Player.

     If all the above conditions are met, the Application will be 
     executed upon its receipt by the Promotor.  The effect of the 
     Application is to temporarily designate the non-Player entity 
     specified in the Application as a Proposing Entity, and to submit 
     the included Proposal on behalf of that entity.  For the purpose of 
     the Rules governing Proposals, the included Proposal shall be 
     deemed to have been submitted when the Application was executed.  
     Immediately after this submission, the entity will cease being a 
     Proposing Entity.  (Losing this designation will not change the 
     identity of the Proposer, it will remain the non-Player entity 
     specified in the Application.)

{Comment: This allows Groups, Contests, and any entity with an Executor
          to make a proposal.  I*ve always been interested in allowing
          the possibility of Groups to propose legislation.  This also
          allows an easier method for group authorship of Rules rather
          than direct fiddling with the Attributions.  All you need is
          to create a contest called *Me & Him Inc.* and submit your
          Proposal Application.}
