                               CFJ 941

All proposed Amendments to the Frankenstein Rule were made impossible
by the Frankenstein Generator when the change to the Frankenstein
Monster assigned to "Week 1", reported by the Mad Scientist on Mon,
11 August 1997, took effect.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

The Frankenstein Generator, 1672, requires among other things that 

      vii) All proposed Amendments to the Frankenstein Rule must
           consist of a single sentence of additional text specifying
           the properties and effects of a Frankenstein Monster, to be
           inserted between the first and last paragraphs.

However, the Frankenstein Monster, at the time specified in the
statement, contained the sentence

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Frankenstein Monster 
      is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing 
      the Frankenstein Monsters, which is permitted only when a 
      Frankenstein Monster or set of Frankenstein Monsters explicitly
      or implicitly permits it.

It did not, however, contain any explicit or implicit permissions
permitting such changes.

The introduction of additional text "specifying the properties and
effects of a Frankenstein Monster" is equivalent to "changing the
Frankenstein Monsters". So the FM prohibits the only proposed
amendments to the FR allowed by the FG.
(Note that amendments that change nothing are excluded by point

       vi) No Amendment can be applied to the Frankenstein Rule that
           is substantially the same as any prior successfully applied
           Amendment to the Frankenstein Rule.

of 1672)

Admittedly, this argument has two ossible weaknesses: The equivalence
stated in the preceding paragraph may be challenged. But I consider
this equivalence to hold - let the judge decide for emself.

And the FM also contains the sentence

      A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.

But I would say that, while the FM is permitted to define such
mechanisms, it doesn't actually do it, so this sentence establishes no
explicit or implicit permission to change the FM, after all.
