In the Elections for Accountor, Archivist, and Assessor, I received
just one nomination for each position, and so the following have been
elected directly to those posts: Blob, Steve, and Steve once more.

Congratulations to Blob and Steve.  Scorekeepor please note that Blob
earns five points for winning an election, while Steve gains ten
points for winning two elections. 

Registrar Michael.
