Amend the rule created by Proposal 3612 (The Repeal-O-Matic II) by
inserting the following text as a new paragraph, after the string "and
[Power] is replaced by the Power of that same Rule.": 


    If a rule picked by the promotor explicitly refers to other rules or
    to concepts or entities that also appear in other rules, the
    promotor is authorized, but not obliged, to add provisions to the
    Proposal that leave the ruleset in a more consistent and functional 
    state after the repeal of the rule picked by the promotor.
