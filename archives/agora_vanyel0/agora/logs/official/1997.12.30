3. WILL REPORT
=============================================================

No Rule requires or prohibits that I disclose which entities have Wills, or
anything about a Will's text.  I do so solely for informational purposes.

Summaries of Wills are not guaranteed to be accurate.

All of the Wills marked (*) have ceased to exist for various reasons, and
are listed solely for historical purposes.

4. PROBATE REPORT
=============================================================

No Rule requires or prohibits that I disclose the identities of
Executors in Probate, except at the time I assign them.  I do so
solely for informational purposes.

Swann is not in Probate.  Others (notably Morendil) may also not be in Probate.

Estate                Executor in Probate

=============================================================
5. FRANKENSTEIN MONSTER REPORT
=============================================================

Required by the Frankenstein Rule.

No Frankenstein Monster has an Administrator or SLC (and thus no FM has a
Maintainer or Jurisdiction of its SLC).  Each Player's Executor is emself;
no other Frankenstein Monster has an Executor.

100 Frankenstein Monsters        Minted by Swann's Frankenstein Contest
Oerjan, Swann                    Defined as such by a Contest's Ordinances

                               CFJ 1077

 "Rule 833 should be interpreted such that it does not cause the
  Proposer of a failed Disinterested Proposal to be billed 1 P-Note."

Relevant rules: 833, 1623

======================================================================

Judge:       Steve
Judgement:

Eligible:    Blob, Chuck, Crito, elJefe, Gen Chaos, Harlequin, Kolja A.,
             Morendil, Murphy, Oerjan, Steve, Swann


Ineligible:
Caller:      Michael
Barred:
On request:
On hold:     Andre, Vir


======================================================================
History:

  Called by Michael, 30 Dec 1997 11:56:56 +0000
  Assigned to Steve, as of this message


======================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

The relevant sentence is: "If the Sponsor and the Proposer of a
Proposal are not the same and the Proposal fails, the Assessor shall
bill the Proposer 1 P-Note."

The Sponsor is earlier defined in the same rule as "The entity which
paid the Petition fee for a given Proposal".  By definition, a
Disinterested Proposal does not have a Sponsor (R1623), so the first
sentence quoted is best interpreted as having no meaning; just as
sentences involving the "King of France in 1997" are meaningless.

Without that sentence, there is no further requirement in this rule
for the Proposer of a Disinterested Proposal to be billed.

Michael
