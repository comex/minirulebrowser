Text of Adopted Proposals
======================================================================
31. Proposal 3810 (Blob) AI = 1
The Treasuror 

Create a rule entitled, "The Treasuror", with text:

     There exists an Office called the Treasuror, with a salary equal
     to zero. 

     The Treasuror is elected like any other Office, except that 
     sometime during the Nominating period for the Office, Nominees
     must issue a Budget. Any Nominee who has not issued a Budget is
     not a Candidate for that Election. This rule takes precedence
     over any other rule which may identify Candidates.
     
     A Budget is a list of all Players' names, each with a corresponding
     number of VTs. The number of VTs must be an integral multiple
     of the MUQ of VTs, and cannot be less than zero. The sum of all
     these amounts must be less than or equal to 50 VTs.

     A Budget is issued by posting it to the Public Forum. A Nominee 
     may issue as many Budgets as e wishes, but only the latest Budget
     issued during the Nominating Period of the Election is allowed 
     to be implemented.

     As soon as possible after the Treasuror is elected, e must
     implement eir Budget. E does so by posting it to the Public Forum
     and announcing that e is implementing it. Only the last valid
     Budget e issued in the Nomination Period can be implemented in
     this way.

     At the time the Budget is thus implemented, all outstanding
     Payment Orders are vacated, and all Players' VT holdings are
     set to the values shown in the Budget. The VT holdings of all
     other entities are set to zero, except for the Bank, which 
     shall contain 50VTs.

     This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would prevent
     these changes from being made.

     One week after the Budget has been implemented, this Rule shall
     repeal itself.

[Comments: 

 v1.0 - This allows us to reset the VT economy to a more certain state,
 to end the current crisis. Rather than choose an arbitrary reset value
 to include in the Proposal, it puts into place the mechanism to reset the
 state with some flexibility, so we can determine the exact values as we
 do best - via political wrangling.

 v1.1 - Realised the language in the old version relied on knowing a long
 of the state which we can't really be sure of - details of many past 
 orders and such. Instead, I have just implemented a one-off blanket 
 vacation of all POs.

 Also added the all important self-repeal clause, so we don't have this
 happening regularly. (Unless people think that might be a good thing?)

 v1.2 - Added clause to set all Group & Contest Treasuries to zero,
 and put 50 VTs in the Bank. Also reduced the total Budget allocation
 to 50 VTs.

]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
33. Proposal 3811 (Kolja) AI = 1
Post-IN cleanup

Repeal rules 1718, 1719 and 1866.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
35. Proposal 3812 (Steve) AI = 1
Actions Without N Objections

Be it hereby resolved that R1728 be retitled "Actions Without N
Objections", and amended to read:

      Certain changes to Nomic Properties may be made Without N
      Objections, where N is an integer between one and five inclusive,
      specifying how many objections are necessary to prevent the change
      from taking place. Only those changes explicitly allowed by other
      Rules may be so made, and in order for such a change to take
      effect, the Rule allowing the change must explicitly state which
      Player or Players are authorized to make the change. If such a
      Rule does not specify a value for N between one and five, the
      value of N is one.

      In order to make a change Without N Objections, a Player
      authorized to make a given change Without N Objections must first
      post to the Public Forum eir intent to make such a change,
      unambiguously describing the change to be made. The change then
      takes place when a Player authorized to make that change Without N
      Objections (who need not be the same player who posted eir intent
      to make the change) posts to the Public Forum that that change is
      made, and the following conditions are fulfilled:

      (a) the post announcing the change is made no fewer than four days
          after, nor more than fourteen days after, the post announcing
          the intent to make the change;

      (b) between the two posts, fewer than N Players posted to the
          Public Forum objecting to the change.

      This Rule defers to Rules which place further restrictions
      on the effectiveness of changes made Without Objection.

Text of Adopted Proposals
======================================================================
4. Proposal 3816 (Repeal-O-Matic) AI = 1
Repeal Rule 951 (Selecting a Judge)

      Rule 951 is hereby Repealed.

Create a new rule, entitled "Selecting a Judge", with the text:

      Whenever there is an open Call for Judgement to which no Player
      has been assigned as its Judge, the Clerk of the Court shall, as
      soon as possible after being made aware of this condition,
      select a Player to be assigned as its Judge.  This selection 
      shall be made from amongst all those Players eligible to serve
      as the Judge of that CFJ.

      Once assigned as the Judge of a CFJ, that Player remains the
      Judge of that CFJ until e is recused from that CFJ, or e ceases
      to be a Player.

      The Clerk shall announce the identity of the Player who is
      assigned to Judge a CFJ as soon as possible after the selection
      is made.

      A CFJ is "open" if it has neither been dismissed nor judged, or
      if there is an outstanding judicial motion pertaining to that
      CFJ which has been neither granted nor denied.  A CFJ which is
      not open is closed.

[Comment: One crucial word has been left out.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Proposal 3817 (Blob) AI = 1
Fix Promotor's Duties
 
 [Comment: There is no need to make the R-O-M selections and the
  Public Service selections "as soon as possible" obligations. There
  is no urgency in these actions, and if they are not done during
  a week, there is not real need to do them twice the next week.
  So, I propose to remove the ASAP clauses.
 
  While I'm at it, I have removed the requirement to put the Public
  Service list in the Promotor's Report. It is a separate issue and
  should be published separately.]

Amend Rule 1753 (Repeal-O-Matic) by replacing the text:
 
      The Promotor shall select five different Rules, 
 
with: 
 
      Each week, the Promotor shall select five different Rules, 
 
 and deleting the text:

      The Promotor shall make these selections as soon as possible
      after the beginning of the Nomic Week.

Amend the Rule "A Duty to Propose" by replacing the text:

      The Promotor shall include this list in eir Promotor's Report.
 
with:

      The Promotor shall publish this list each Week.

and the text:

      As soon as possible after the beginning of each Week, 

with:

      Each Week,

34. Proposal 3818 (Chuck) AI = 3
Trombone Concerto

I request that this Proposal have AI=3.

Rule 955 is amended by appending a paragraph reading

      A Proposal may not have its Voting Index set except
      as described in this Rule.  A Proposal may not be adopted
      (synonymous with the Proposal passing) except as described
      in this Rule.

A Rule shall be created with Power=3 and text as follows:

      Except as described in this Rule, no entity can set the Power
      of another entity to exceed the Power of the entity causing
      the Power to be so set.  A Rule may set the Power of an adopted
      Proposal, even exceeding the Power of the Rule, so long as the
      Power of the adopted Proposal does not exceed the Voting Index
      of that Proposal.

      No entity may destroy or repeal an entity with Power greater
      than its own.

Evidentiary Status of Officer Reports

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1768 be amended to read:

      (a) The published Report of an Officer, with respect to those
          matters reported therein which that Officer is required by
          law to report, shall be determinative evidence of the facts
          therein presented, in the absence of clear and convincing
          evidence contrary to those facts.

      (b) No challenge to the published Report of an Officer, with
          respect to those matters reported therein which that Officer
          is required by law to report, shall proceed unless:
          (1) it was initiated within 21 days of the publication of
              that report; or 
          (2) credible evidence that the Officer acted in bad faith,
              or acted in good faith upon information presented to em
              in bad faith, is presented.

      (c) For the purpose of this Rule, the Speaker shall be
          considered an Officer.

18. Proposal  (Gen Chaos) AI = 1
Proposals May Order

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1794 be amended to read:

      (a) Each Order is of one of the following classes:
        (1) Judicial: A Judicial Order is an Order executed by a
            Player while acting as a Judge.
        (2) Appellate: An Appellate Order is an Order executed by a
            Board of Appeals. 
        (3) Administrative: An Administrative Order is an Order
            executed by an Officer in the course of performing the
            duties of that Office, except when those duties involve
            acting as a member of a Board of Appeals.
        (4) Legislative: A Legislative Order is an Order executed as
            part of the effect of the adoption of a Proposal.
        (5) Private: A Private Order is any Order not described above.

      (b) For the purpose of this Rule, the holder of any of the
          following positions shall be considered an Officer when
          performing a duty required by or a privilege permitted only
          by virtue of holding that position:
        (1) the Speaker;
        (2) the Recordkeepor of a Currency; or
        (3) the Trustee of an entity in Probate.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      (a) A Proposal may contain one or more Orders.  

      (b) The effect of adopting a Proposal which contains Orders is
          to execute those Orders.  Such Orders are known as
          Legislative Orders, are deemed to have been executed by that
          Proposal, and are deemed to have been executed as of the
          date of the proclamation of the Proposal's adoption.

      (c) Legislative Orders may not be stayed, vacated, or amended
          except:
        (1) by a subsequent Legislative Order;
        (2) by a Judicial Order issued only after a judicial finding
            that the Proposal containing the Legislative Order was not
            adopted, was barred from taking effect, or was invalid; or
        (3) by the Clerk of the Courts, but only for the purpose of
            staying such an Order during the pendency of a dispute
            which might reasonably lead to a judicial finding of the
            sort mentioned in subdivision (c)(2) of this Rule.

20. Proposal  (Gen Chaos) AI = 1
Executorship

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1478 be amended to read:

      (a) The Executor of an entity is a Player who is empowered by
          the Rules to act on behalf of that entity, as if e was that
          entity.
        (1) Except when the Rules stipulate otherwise, a Player is eir
            own Executor.
        (2) Any other entity has an Executor only when the Rules
            permit that entity to have an Executor, and a Certificate
            of Executorship has been filed with the Notary for that
            entity.

      (b) Before a Player may act as the Executor of an entity, e must
          file with the Notary a Certificate of Executorship. A
          Certificate of Executorship must set out:
        (1) the entity of which the Player is the Executor;
        (2) the Player's own name; and
        (3) the authority under which that Player claims to be
            Executor of that entity.

      (c) The Notary shall maintain a record of all Certificates of
          Executorship filed with em, and shall include in eir weekly
          Report a list of every entity not a Player which has an
          Executor, and the Player named in the most recent
          Certificate of Executorship filed with em for that entity.

      (d) A person ceases to be the Executor of an entity when that
          person ceases to be a Player, any other Rule to the contrary
          notwithstanding.


      (e) The determination by an Officer that a Player was not acting
          as the Executor of an entity other than emself shall not be
          subject to judicial review, in those cases where no
          Certificate of Executorship has been filed with the Notary
          naming that Player as the Exector of the entity in question.

      (f) Any Player who files a false Certificate of Executorship
          commits a Class B Crime. A Judge who determines that a
          Certificate of Executorship was filed falsely shall Order
          the Notary to disregard that filing.

      (g) For the purpose of subdivision (e) of this Rule, the holder
          of any of the following positions shall be considered an
          Officer when performing a duty required by or a privilege
          permitted only by virtue of holding that position:
        (1) the Speaker;
        (2) the Recordkeepor of a Currency; or
        (3) the Trustee of an entity in Probate.

Be it therefore resolved, that Rules 1841 and 1842 be repealed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
22. Proposal  (Gen Chaos) AI = 1
Cleanup of R.1445

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1445 be amended to read:

      (a) When an Election is required and the procedure is not
          defined elsewhere, the following Standard Election Procedure
          shall be used. Details specified herein are defaults which
          may be modified by other Rules for specific situations.
        (1) Vote Collector: The Vote Collector is the Entity
            responsible for taking nominations, collecting and
            tallying the Votes, and announcing the result.

              who is Speaker at the time the Referendum starts.
          (B) If another Player is specified, this Player shall be the
              Vote Collector for the entire duration of the
              Referendum.
          (C) If the Vote Collector deregisters or is deregistered
              before the Voting Period ends, the Election has no
              Winner.
        (2) Nominating Entities: Every Player not on Hold may Nominate
            eirself in an Election. On Hold status is measured at the
            time a Player makes a Nomination.
        (3) Nominations: A Nominating Entity makes a Nomination by
            sending a message to the Vote Collector during the
            Nominations Period, indicating what Election e is
            Nominating for.
        (4) Candidates: A Player who has Nominated for an Election is
            called a Candidate for that Election.
        (5) Retraction: A Nomination, once sent to the Vote Collector,
            may be retracted before the end of the Nominating Period.
            A player may retract a Nomination e has made by sending a
            message to the Vote Collector, indicating the e wished to
            retract eir Nomination.
        (6) Start of Nominations: The Nominating Period begins at the
            time of the first correct and legal announcement that the
            Election has begun, as required by the Rules calling for
            the Election.
        (7) Duration of Nominations: The Nominating Period lasts for
            one Week.  All Nominations received by the Vote Collector
            outside of the Nominating Period have no effect.
        (8) Secrecy: Nominations need not be kept secret.

      (b) Announcing Candidates: the Vote Collector shall announce to
          the Public Forum, as soon as possible after the Nominating
          Period is over, the names of all Players who Nominated for
          the Election.

      (c) If there are no Candidates in a given Election, then that
          Election shall have no Winner. If there is only one
          Candidate in a given Election, then that Candidate shall be
          the Winner of that Election.

      (d) In all other cases, a Referendum shall being at the time
          Candidates are Announced, which shall be conducted using the
          standard procedure for Referendum Voting with the following
          exceptions:
        (1) Vote Collector: The Vote Collector for the Referendum is
            the same as the Vote Collector for the Election.
        (2) Vote Values: A Vote is the name of exactly one of the
            Candidates for the given Election. Words which are
            effectively synonymous with these are also permissible.
        (3) Adoption: The Winner of the Election is the Candidate for
            whom the most votes were cast. If there is more than one
            such candidate, the Speaker chooses one of those
            candidates as the winner, and must announce eir chosen
            candidate as winner to the Public Forum.
        (4) Quorum: Quorum shall be set at 50% of the eligible Voting
            Entities at the beginning of the Voting Period. If a
            smaller fraction voted, the Election has no Winner.

      (e) Nonperformance by Vote Collector: The Vote Collector must
          perform eir required duties, but if the result of an
          Election is not announced within one Week following the end
          of the Voting Period, the Election has no Winner.

      (f) Effective Time of Election Results: The results of an
          Election are effective at the time the results of the
          Referendum are announced; or, if there is no Referendum, at
          the time that the Vote Collector announces that there is to
          be no Referendum.

      (g) Cutoff for Challenges: Any challenge of the correctness of
          the announced results of an Election must be made within
          seven days of the time the results are announced.  If seven
          days pass from the time the results are announced without a
          challenge, the announced results are the true results of
          that Election, whether or not they be in error in any way.

More Cleanups

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1048 be amended to read:

      (a) A Rule Change that Creates a new Rule may specify an
          existing Category to which the new Rule will be assigned. 
          If it does not, the Rulekeepor shall choose the new Rule's
          Category.  When doing so, the Rulekeepor may create a new
          Rule Category and assign the Rule to this new Category.

      (b) The Rulekeepor may remove an empty Rule Category as e sees
          fit.

      (c) If the Rulekeepor creates or removes a Category, e must
          announce it in the Public Forum no later than the first
          subsequent publication of the Logical Ruleset.

      (d) The Rulekeepor is authorized to change the name of a Rule
          Category or change the Category to which a Rule is assigned
          Without Objection.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1681 be amended to read:

      (a) There is a format of the Ruleset known as the Short Logical
          Ruleset (SLR).  In this format, each Rule is assigned to a
          Rule Category, and the Rules are grouped according to their
          Category.  Within a Category, the ordering of Rules is
          decided by the Rulekeepor.  All existing Rule Categories
          must be listed, even if no Rules are currently assigned to
          the Category.

      (b) The listing of each Rule in the SLR must include:
        (1) The Rule Number
        (2) The Rule's Amendment Number
        (3) The Rule's Power
        (4) The Rule's Title
        (5) The Rule's text
        (6) Any annotations to the Rule required by Order

      (c) The Rulekeepor is strongly encouraged not to include any
          additional information in the SLR, except that which
          increases the readability of the SLR.

      (d) There is a format of the Ruleset known as the Full Logical
          Ruleset (FLR).  In this format, Rules are assigned to the
          same Category and presented in the same order as in the SLR.
          The FLR must contain all the information required to be in
          the SLR, as well as:
        (1) A brief description of each Category
        (2) Any historical annotations which the Rulekeepor is
            required to record.

      (e) The Rulekeepor is also free to include any other information
          which e feels may be helpful in the use of the Ruleset in

24. Proposal  (Gen Chaos) AI = 1
Cleanup of R.1006

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1006 be amended to read:

      (a) An Office is any position established by the Rules as such.

      (b) At any time, a given Office is held by exactly one Player. 
          If an Office would otherwise not be held by any Player, it
          shall be held by the Speaker.

      (c) An Officer is any Player who holds an Office.

      (d) A given Office has whatever duties, responsibilities, and
          privileges that the Rules assign to it.

[Most of the rest of the current R.1006 is superfluous baggage.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
25. Proposal  (Gen Chaos) AI = 1
Proposal of the Week

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1483 be amended to read:

      (a) A Proposal is any document clearly marked as such by its
          creator.

      (b) A Proposal is Proposed when it is transmitted by a Proposing
          Entity to the Promotor with the clear indication that it is
          being transmitted for the purpose of Proposing it.

      (c) A Proposal is not Proposed if, in the Promotor's judgment,
          it is substantially identical to another Proposal Proposed
          within the past three weeks, unless
        (1) the Proposing Entity submitting the Proposal clearly
            indicates at the time of submission that the Proposal is
            intended to become a duplicate of the prior Proposal, or
        (2) the prior Proposal has been discarded or withdrawn, or has
            been distributed and the results of voting upon that
            Proposal have been announced by the Assessor.

      (d) The Promotor's determination that a Proposal has or has not
          been Proposed (including a determination made under
          subdivision (c) of this Rule) is subject to judicial review
          only for abuse of discretion.

      (e) Under no circumstance shall the Promotor's distribution of
          previously undistributed Proposals constitute the submission
          of a new Proposal.

28. Proposal  (Gen Chaos) AI = 1
Eliminate ASAP I

Be it therefore resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Whenever the Rules require a Player to perform some duty
          after the occurence of an event, and specifies a time limit
          for doing so, the failure of that Player to perform the duty
          within that time limit in no way abates that Player's
          obligation to perform that duty, unless the Rule which
          imposes that obligation specifies otherwise.

      (b) Whenever the Rules require a Player to perform some duty at
          least once within any given time interval (such as once each
          week, or each month), and that Player fails to do so, e is
          not obligated to do so twice during the next such time
          period, unless the Rule which imposes that obligation
          specifies otherwise.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 208 be amended to read:

      (a) The Assessor shall publish all the Votes cast upon a
          Proposal within seven days of the end of that Proposal's
          Voting Period.

      (b) The Assessor shall not publish the Votes cast on a Proposal
          prior to the time e publishes the Votes cast on:
        (1) all Proposals whose Voting Periods ended before that of
            the Proposal in question, and
        (2) all Proposals whose Voting Periods ended at the same time
            as the Proposal in question and which have a lower number.

Keep Conway Out Of The Clock

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1527 be amended to read:

      Whenever a message contains more than one notification, report,
      or other communication in which the Rules place some legal
      significance, and the relative order of those communications is
      legally relevant, those communications shall be considered to
      have been sent in the order in which they appear in that
      message.  All such communications are considered to have been
      sent at the same time, however.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
36. Proposal  (Gen Chaos) AI = 3
Winning Isn't Anything

Be it therefore resolved, that Rules 112, 1498, 1580, 1622, 1638, 1729
and 1697 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1435 be amended by deleting the
sentence, "It is a Win-Preventing condition for a Player to have one
or more Blots."

----------------------------------------------------------------------
38. Proposal  (Gen Chaos) AI = 1

Be it therefore resolved, that Rules 1446 and 1539 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1727 be amended by deleting the
paragraph containing the words "three Contests".

----------------------------------------------------------------------
39. Proposal  (Blob) AI = 1
Let everyone have a turn

Create a rule, with title "Turns for all", with text:

     Whenever a Player is selected to judge a CFJ, e becomes ineligible
     to judge any future CFJs. If ever there are no Players eligible to
     Judge a CFJ, then all Players made ineligible by this rule become
     eligible again.

     Being made ineligible to judge a CFJ by this rule does not cause
     a Player to become ineligible to serve as a Justice on that CFJ.
     This rule takes precedence over any rule which claims otherwise.


Amend Rule 698 ("Always an Eligible Judge"), by replacing the text:

      If there would otherwise be no Players eligible to Judge a CFJ,
      then all Active Players, excluding the Caller and those Players
      Barred by the Caller, shall be eligible, any other Rule to the
      contrary notwithstanding.

with:

      If, after taking all other rules affecting eligibility into
      account, there are no Players eligible to Judge a CFJ, then
      all Active Players, excluding the Caller and those Players
      Barred by the Caller, shall be eligible, any other Rule to 
      the contrary notwithstanding.

[Comments: 

v1.0: Complementary to the recent R-O-M proposal, although not
      necessarily relying on it. We've had the same judge selection 
      mechanism for ages, and while it works well enough, it might be 
      interesting to try something new.

v1.1: Added the second paragraph, at Michael's recommendation

v1.2: Amended R698 to explicitly apply only after all other rules have
      had there say.

More Sensible Amendment Numbers

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1069 be amended to read:

      (a) Each Rule shall have an Amendment Number.
        (1) The Amendment Number of a new Rule, when that Rule is
            created, is zero.
        (2) The Amendment Number of each Rule existing at the time
            this version of this Rule takes effect is whatever its
            Amendment Number was under the prior version of this Rule;
            if a Rule had no Amendment Number on that version of this
            Rule, its Amendment Number is zero.
        (3) The Amendment Number of a Rule is incremented by one
            whenever a Rule Change affecting that Rule takes place.

      (b) A Rule's Amendment Number shall be displayed in Official
          copies of the Ruleset, appended to the Rule Number, and
          separated by a forward slash.  Responsibility is given to
          the Rulekeepor to accurately update Amendment Numbers.

      (c) Amendment Numbers may be used for Official purposes and in
          Official documents to distinguish between old versions of a
          Rule and the Rule's current text.

Restore Sanity

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 206 be amended to read:

      (a) Each Player is entitled to cast at most one Vote upon each
          Proposal.

      (b) A Player may be deprived of the right to cast a Vote upon
          any one Proposal, or upon Proposals generally, by the Rules
          or by an Order issued pursuant to the Rules.

      (c) No entity other than a Player may cast Votes upon Proposals.

      (d) The term "Voting Entity" is hereby declared to be synonymous
          with "Player", except where such construction would clearly
          not make sense.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 683 be amended to read:

      (a) A Player casts a vote upon a Proposal by sending a message
          to the Assessor specifying the Vote e is casting and the
          Proposal upon which it is cast.

      (b) A vote cast under this Rule must be one of FOR, AGAINST, or
          ABSTAIN, or an obvious synonym thereof.

      (c) Any attempt by a Player to cast a vote is void and without
          legal effect if:
        (1) the attempt is made other than during the Voting Period of
            the Proposal in question,
        (2) the Player attempting to cast a Vote is barred from Voting
            upon that Proposal by the Rules or by an Order then in
            effect barring em from doing so,
        (3) the Player attempting to cast a Vote has previously cast a
            vote (other than a vote made void by this subrule) upon
            that Proposal, or
        (4) the attempt violates, or if allowed would violate, this or
            any other Rule.

      (d) Votes, once cast according to this Rule, cannot be
          retracted, cancelled, or changed except when the Rules
          require it, and then only as required by the Rules.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1449 be amended to read:

There shall exist the Office of Assessor.  The Assessor shall receive
a weekly salary equal to the Basic Officer Salary.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1771 be amended to read:

      (a) Not more than once in any Nomic Week, each Player may select
          any one Proposal in the Proposal Queue and may increase or
          decrease the priority of that Proposal by one, by sending a
          message to the Promotor indicating the Proposal to be
          affected and whether that Proposal's priority is to be
          increased or decreased.

      (b) An attempt to change the Priority of a Proposal in the
          Proposal Queue shall be void and without legal effect if:
        (1) the Player who attempted it has already changed the
            priority of any Proposal during the same Nomic Week;
        (2) the attempt relates to a Proposal which is no longer in
            the Proposal Queue; or
        (3) the change attempted would result in the Proposal having a
            priority less than zero.

      (c) The Promotor and the Speaker shall each be permitted to
          exercise the right given by subdivision (a) of this Rule
          twice in each week, instead of once.  However, if the same
          Player is both Promotor and Speaker, e may not exercise this
          right three times.  The remainder of this Rule shall be
          interpreted so as to be consistent with the intent of this
          subrule.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1036 be amended, by replacing the
word "zero" with "one" wherever it appears.

Be it further resolved, that Rules 1442, 1765, 1715, 1824, 1660, 1760,
1723, 1724, 1772 and 1862 be repealed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
45. Proposal  (Gen Chaos) AI = 1
Every Man Is an Island

Be it therefore resolved, that Rules 766, 716, 719, 721, 1752, 718,
1446, 1539, 1528, 1614, 1612, 1531, 1547, 1759, 1533, 1397, 1617, 1458
and 717 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 206 be amended, by replacing
"Players and Groups are Voting Entities" with "Players are Voting
Entities".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1637 be amended, by deleting the
paragraph which begins "A Will belonging to an Organization".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1727 be amended, by deleting the
paragraph which contains the phrase "the Notary may select".

Be it further resolved, that Rules 1601, 1637, 1738 and 1757 be
amended, by replacing the word "Notary" with the word "Chancellor"
wherever it may appear.

[While there may be some utility in allowing bodies corporate, the
current Rules woefully fail to accomplish this in any useful sense.
Furthermore, most contests can be adequately carried forth under the
Law of Contracts (Rule 1742) without requiring the overhead of
statutory support.  SLCs should probably also go, but I'll cross that
bridge when I find it.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
46. Proposal  (Gen Chaos) AI = 2
Unlimited Voting

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 206 be amended to read:

      (a) A Voting Entity is an Entity which is generally authorized
          by the Rules to cast a vote or votes on a Proposal.  Other
          Rules may withdraw this authorization from a Voting Entity
          in specific circumstances without that Entity thereby
          ceasing to be a Voting Entity.  Only those Entities
          designated by the Rules to be Voting Entities are Voting
          Entities.

      (b) No Entity is permitted to vote on a Proposal unless it is a
          Voting Entity.

      (c) Players and Groups are Voting Entities.

      (d) Unless otherwise specified, each Voting Entity may cast an
          unlimited number of Votes on a Proposal.

Be it further resolved, that Rules 1660 and 1765 be repealed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
47. Proposal  (Gen Chaos) AI = 1
Oh, what a tangled web....

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 478 be amended to read:

      (a) A Public Forum is any medium of communication so designated
          as such by the Registrar.

      (b) The Registrar may designate any medium as a Public Forum, or
          revoke such designation from a medium already so designated,
          Without Objection.  However, The message which is to
          effectuate the change intended must be sent via a medium
          which is a Public Forum both before and after the
          designation or revocation, in order to have legal effect.

      (c) Every Active Player shall ensure that e is able to receive
          messages sent to every medium which the Registrar has
          designated as a Public Forum.  However, the temporary
          inability of a Player to receive a Public Forum does not
          deprive that medium of its status as a Public Forum.

      (d) Any message conveyed by one or more Public Fora is deemed to
          have been sent to the Public Forum.

      (e) Subdivision (d) of this Rule notwithstanding, any message
          sent, by any medium or combination of media, to every Active
          Player so that each Active Player is reasonably certain to
          receive it, is deemed to have been sent to the Public Forum,
          but only if it bears a clear indication that it is intended
          to be a Public Forum message.

      (f) Whenever the Rules require a Player to "announce", "post",
          or "distribute" some communication or notification, that
          Player shall do so by sending it to the Public Forum, unless
          the Rules specify otherwise in that instance.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
48. Proposal  (Gen Chaos) AI = 1
Some Housecleaning

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 408 be amended to read:

      (a) The Judge of an open CFJ is required to, within seven days
          of when that CFJ last became open or seven days of eir
          assignment to that CFJ, whichever is later, close that CFJ
          by dismissing or judging the CFJ and/or granting or denying
          any outstanding judicial motions pertaining to that CFJ.

      (b) The failure of a Judge to close a case within the prescribed
          time constitutes the Infraction of Judicial Tardiness and
          carries a penalty of one Blot for each day (or fraction
          thereof) that the case remains open beyond the permitted
          time.  This penalty is to be reported by the Clerk of the
          Courts.

      (c) The failure to observe this time limit does not, by itself,
          cause the delinquent Judge to be recused from the CFJ, nor
          does it invalidate eir judgment or dismissal of the CFJ or
          grant or denial of any related judicial motion which that
          Judge might submit after the limit has expired.

      (d) This Rule defers to any other Rule which prescribes a
          different time limit in which a CFJ must be closed, and to
          any other Rule which establishes procedures by which the
          time limit specified in this Rule may be extended or
          shortened.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
49. Proposal  (Gen Chaos) AI = 1
Down with Playerism!

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 833 be amended to read:

      As soon as possible after the beginning of the Nomic Week, the
      Assessor shall pay out two Proposal Notes to each entity who
      submitted an Interested Proposal which was adopted during the
      previous Week.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
50. Proposal  (Andre) AI = 1
Amendment Applications

Let a Rule be created, with the Title 'Amendment Applications', and
the following text:

  There exists a type of Application called an Amendment Application. 
  Such an Application is Executed by submitting it to the Promotor.
  For an Amendment Application to be effective:

  * it must state that it is an Amendment Application;

  * it must clearly identify exactly one Proposal to which it applies;

  * the Proposal to which it applies must be in the Proposal Queue

  * it must contain a text, clearly identified as such, that is to be
  the new text of the Proposal;

  * it must contain the signature of the Executor of the Proposer of
  the Proposal

  * it must contain the signature of each Player that increased the
  Priority of the Proposal

  When an Amendment Application takes effect, the text of the Proposal
  is changed to the text specified in the Amendment Application.

Furthermore, let Rule 1036 be changed by changing the phrase
  "This publication shall include the number, title, priority, and
   time of proposal, for each proposal in the Queue."
by
  "This publication shall include the number, Proposer, title, 
   Priority, and time of proposal, as well as any Players other than
   the Proposer who increasted the Priority of the Proposal, for each
   proposal in the Queue."
