Hi all,

The following IN proposal was distributed. Our Agora referendum on
this will run for one week.

>>
INP 378
submitted bu Macronomic


	Create the following new rule:
	Any liaison may request a survey by informing all liaisons of the
question they wish to ask.  That liaison then becomes the administrator for
the survey.  The liaison for every member nomic wishing to participate in
the survey  should give the administrator a list of the e-mail addresses
for all players in that nomic who will participate in the survey within one
week.  The administrator should ask each of those players the survey
question, counting a player once even if the are members of multiple
nomics.  One week after players have been asked, the administrator should
inform all liaisons of the results of the survey, however they may not
include the names of the respondents.

BTW, could someone send me a copy of my last Ambassador's report? I
seem to have lost mine. Thanks!

Kolja A.
