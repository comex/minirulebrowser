  Injunction upheld by elJefe, 17 Jan 1998, 09:07:57 +0000


======================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

Firstly the facts. These are as follows:

Proposal 3640 was an Insane Proposal. R1729 ('Insanity') states that:

      For such a Proposal, until the Voting Period has ended:
      there shall be no discussing Votes, or this Rule has been
         bended.
      Nor shall a Player Vote in public, only to Assessor.
      The Votes shall be unknown to others, even employer and
         professor.

On Thu, 18 Dec 1997 10:55:40 +0100, Morendil sent a message to the
Public Forum voting on P3640. In a message dated Tue, 23 Dec 1997
13:57:25 +0100, and also sent to the Public Forum, Morendil
subsequently retracted these votes (see the Evidence attached for
both messages).

There are a number of points I think it worth bringing to the attention
of the Judge. Firstly, the matter of the Public Voting Experiment. R1749,
in force at the time, stated that:

      Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
      any votes by Voting Entities on Proposals, Elections or
      Referenda, may only be achieved by sending a message to the
      Public Forum.

Was there a conflict between Rules 1729 and 1749, a conflict which
R1749 would have won in virtue of its precedence claim? I argue that
there was no conflict. R1749 made it impossible to vote without
sending a message to the PF; R1729 merely makes it illegal to vote by
sending a message to the PF. The result is clear and achieved without
conflict between the Rules: no Player could legally vote on P3640. A
Player could, however, vote illegally on P3640 by sending a message
to the PF, violating the stricture in R1729 that Players shall not
vote in public on Insane Proposals. This is what I argue Morendil did.

Secondly, we can quickly dismiss the matter of R1729's use of the
word 'bended'. Although it is an interesting question whether there
is a distinction recognized by Agoran law between breaking the rules
and merely bending them, that question is not relevant here. The
'bending' of R1729 arises in reference to the *discussion* of votes
on Insane Proposals, not the act of voting itself. As far as that
act is concerned, R1729 is crystal clear in prohibiting public
voting on Insane Proposals, when it says "Nor shall a Player vote
in public, only to Assessor. / The Votes shall be unknown to others,
even employer and professor."

Finally, there is the question of Morendil's retraction of his
votes. Does this save him from having violated R1729? I do not
think so. I argue that the Rules can distinguish between a case in
which a Player first votes and then retracts his vote, and a case
in which a Player does not vote at all. The fact that Morendil
subsequently retracted his vote does not make it any less true that
he had earlier voted, in violation of R1729.


======================================================================
Judge's Arguments:

I concur with the Steve's argument in calling this judgement. Morendil
has clearly violated rule 1729. I have little to add to the points
Steve has already made.

I will say that if, when a player retracts eir vote, e really has not
voted at all, then this makes for a very complicated interpretation of
such rules as 452. How is the Vote Collector to know in advance which
voting messages are actually votes, and which are not? A much more
sensible interpretation, and, I believe, the one shown by strong game
custom, is that all such messages are indeed "votes", at least for a
time.

With regard to Morendil's intention at the time of voting, I notice that
Rule 1575 only pardons those who were ignorant of the Crimes they were
committing. [Aside: why is that paragraph in there twice?] As this case
is a plain rule violation, and not a Crime, this consideration does not
apply.

As I think it is beyond reasonable doubt that Morendil violated rule
1729, I hereby judge this statement to be TRUE.

======================================================================
Appellant's Arguments:

I hereby call for the Appeal of this Injunction, on the grounds that
"I'm" and "tree!" are not single words. :-P


======================================================================
Decision of pro-Speaker Oerjan: UPHOLD

This Justice determines, in agreement with fellow Justice ElJefe's
argument, that the Injunction was legal and appropriate given the
situation, and should be sustained.


======================================================================
Decision of the CotC:  UPHOLD

I judge this Injunction legal and appropriate, as it appears on its face to
satisfy the requirements of Rule 908.

"I'm" is a contraction, which is a gray area for "words".  One common-sense
sufficiency test for being a word seems to be indivisibility, namely
whether the text could be divided into smaller parts that could stand on
their own.  "I'm" cannot be so divided, and I would say that it counts as a
word.

In passing, I note that though "tree!" may not be a word, "tree" is, and
the "!" could be taken as the terminator of the Judge's sentence rather
than part of a Prescribed Word.  An apology that included "tree" but not
the string "tree!" would probably satisfy the injunction.

As for appropriateness, it is an old tradition of Agora to impose such
conditions upon Public Apologies.  I wish Morendil well in composing his.


======================================================================
Decision of the Justiciar: UPHOLD

In the matter of the appeal of the Injunction attached to CFJ 1078, I
join the published opinion of my colleague elJefe in finding that the
Injunction is proper and appropriate.
