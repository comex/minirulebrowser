  Fresh Appeals Board formed and announced, as of this message

======================================================================

Judgement: TRUE

Reasons and arguments:

The definition of Proposal is in Rule 1483, power = 1.

      A Proposal is created whenever a Proposing Entity delivers some
      collection of text to the Promotor with the clear indication
      that that text is intended to become a Proposal.  The collection
      of text thus delivered is a new Proposal, and the Proposing
      Entity which delivered it its Proposer. A collection of text is
      said to be Proposed when it becomes a Proposal.

      The delivery of the text of an existing Proposal which was
      Proposed less than three weeks previously does not cause that
      text to become another Proposal, unless there is a clear
      indication that that text is intended to become a duplicate of a
      prior Proposal.  In this case, the Proposing Entity must
      specifically acknowledge that the intended new Proposal is a
      duplicate of an existing Proposal.

      Further, the Promotor's distribution of previously undistributed
      Proposals never causes the Proposing of new Proposals.

The issue of contention in the statement of the CFJ comes about
because a piece of text presumed to have been a Proposal was
distributed by Promotor Blob at time Wed, 4 Mar 1998 13:14:12 +1100
(EST), in an e-mail message with ID:
   <980304021412.8886@cse.unsw.edu.au>.

However, the text distributed as Proposal 3710 included the following:

      This Rule commemorates the Glorious and Dramatic Wins achieved
      by the Members of the Threat, Blob, elJefe, General Chaos and
      Steve, with the passage of Proposal <proposal numberat time
      <time>, which were made possible primarily by exploiting a
      loophole in the Rule 'Officer's Veto'.

I shall now argue that this paragraph was not present in any
collection of text delivered to the Promotor with the clear indication
that this text was intended to become a Proposal.

Who might have delivered such a text?  Swann certainly did not deliver
this text to Blob.  He did deliver a similar text, but it was
sufficiently different not to be legally the same.  (The only rules
allowing for different texts to be considered legally same are R754,
which talks only of differences of spelling, grammar and dialect, and
R1339 which talks of variation of white-space and capitalisation in
rule change specifications.)

Could Blob have delivered the text to himself in such a way as to
satisfy the conditions in R1483?  This is a more interesting question.
However, I do not believe that this could have happened for two
reasons:

i)  We have no evidence to suggest that Blob at any stage initiated
    the delivery of the text in question, except possibly when he
    distributed the text in the message referred to above.  We rule
    out this latter possibility, because as is clear from the
    reactions of the Players of Agora (who voted on the putative
    Proposal), there was no clear indication that this text was
    intended to become a Proposal.  Rather the distribution of this
    text (including its delivery to Blob via the Public Forum)
    convinced everyone that a real Proposal was before them and had
    been distributed.

ii) Even if Blob did manage to somehow deliver the text to himself
    prior to his ditribution of it to the Public Forum, his subsequent
    behaviour again suggests that there was no clear indication
    attached to the text that this was intended to become a Proposal.
    If there had been such an indication with the text, then he would
    not have distributed it under Swann's name, and would not have
    attributed it an Urgency that it did not have.

As the text distributed in the message referred to above is the only
possible instance of a Proposal being distributed with the name in
question, and as I have ruled out this possibility, I conclude that
the statement of the CFJ is TRUE.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Promotor Blob's attempt to distribute this Proposal included a typo
not present in Swann's Proposal submission.  This statement claims
that, therefore, the text in Blob's message was not a Proposal at all;
in particular, that Blob had not implicitly submitted that text as a
Proposal

======================================================================
                               CFJ 1089

  The Proposal submitted by Swann and entitled "The Great Officer's
  Veto Scam Proposal" has not been distributed.

======================================================================

I follow Justice Morendil a long way in his reasoning. I agree with
him that Rule 754 is not really relevant here (although the question
of the relevance of R1339 is one I will return to later), and that
the issue turns on the question of the identity of texts, that is,
on the circumstances under which we should be prepared to say that
two texts are 'the same'. I agree with Morendil that on this issue
the Rules are silent. I agree that our Judgements should therefore
reflect commonsense and the best interests of the game, in accordance
with R217. 

However, the argument he gives that the best interests of the game
are served by applying a very strict notion of identity ('identity
under diff' as we might call it) has been effectively rebutted by
Kolja, who pointed out that R107 guarantees that whatever gets
distributed is what Players are voting on. So the question of whether
identity under diff really is the best notion of identity for us to
use remains open, as far as the arguments that presented by Morendil
are concerned. That is not to say that identity under diff should be
rejected - far from it. It is one of a number of standards now
awaiting a defence which are competing for our attention.

Certainly identity under diff has advantages which Morendil does not
explicitly mention. It is simple and easy to apply, yielding clear
answers in most cases. Perhaps it is to be preferred for this reason.
Yet there are arguments against it. Consider capitalization, for
instance. Former Rulekeepor Wes arbitrarily changed the capitalization 
of many Rules in ways that would violate identity under diff, and yet
we accepted those changes as not changing the identity of the Rules.
So historically speaking, simple identity under diff does not seem to
be the standard that we have used in judging whether two texts are
the same.

One could argue in addition that identity under diff is not the
standard that we should use, on the grounds that it is too strict. If
strict identity under diff is to be our standard, then no typo
introduced into a Proposal by the Promotor, however miniscule, will
ever be considered insignificant. I don't think that is a desirable
outcome. (That's not to say that no typo - in particular, the one
introduced into P3710 - should be considered significant.) In that
case, the simplicity of identity under diff, supposedly its strength,
may actually be a weakness: it may be too simple to meet our needs. 

The challenge then is to say in what ways identity under diff should
be relaxed, or with what it should be replaced. I propose to do what
I can to develop an alternative standard. To do that, we need to have
a clear understanding of what our needs are. As I've already intimated 
above, I don't think it's desirable (ie in the best interests of the
game) that every typo introduced by the Promotor into a Proposal
should invalidate the distribution of the Proposal. I think we would
be best served by a standard which enabled us to say, at least some
of the time, "Well, sure, there's a typo, but it's still the same
Proposal." So strict identity under diff is out.

Working from the other end, equally clearly we don't want to allow a
situation in which it would legal for the Promotor deliberately to
make substantial changes to a Proposal, and then offer as a defence,
"Well, sure, it's completely different, but it's still the same
Proposal." So, as a proposed standard, 'anything goes' is also out.

That knocks out the extreme positions, leaving a large territory in
the middle to explore. One temptation is to begin by distinguishing
between accidental and deliberate changes introduced into a Proposal,
and to completely rule out the latter. But I think that temptation
should be resisted. If we had case where a Promotor had corrected
a spelling mistake before distributing a Proposal, I think our
standard should allow us to say that the Proposal has been distributed.

A better strategy returns us to R1339: if two collections of text
have different effects when adopted, then those collections of text
are not the same. (Note that this does not imply that if two
collections of text have the same effects when adopted, they should
be regarded as the same.) Nevertheless, if a change introduced by
the Promotor, either accidentally or deliberately, results in a
text different in its effects when adopted than the text submitted
to the Promotor, then I think that this is sufficient to show that
the texts are not identical. Since R1339 is very clear that the
change introduced by Promotor Blob into Swann's Proposal results
in a text with a different effect, I think we have no choice but to
conclude that Promotor Blob did not distribute Swann's Proposal.

I therefore sustain Kolja's Judgement.
