COE admitted. Swann became ineligible on 28 August, when Rul 408
disinfected itself. The relevant part of the report should read:

History:
  Called by Crito, Mon, 04 Aug 1997 12:13:15 -0400
  Assigned to Swann, Tue, 5 Aug 1997 12:14:21 +0100
  Swann becomes ineligible, 28 Aug 1997
  Assigned to Elde, as of this message

where 'this message' is the message on which the COE was made.

Andre is therefore Elected Clerk of the Courts, and Murphy is Elected
Notary. They hold these Offices in the normal fashion as of this
message. Their Terms of Service will expire 01 Jan 1998.

In the Election for the Office of Commander-in-Chief, we have a tie
betwixt Harlequin and Vlad. I therefore call upon the Speaker, General
Chaos, to break the tie by choosing one of the Candidates as the winner,
and announcing his choice in the Public Forum, in accordance with R1445.

Vote Collector Steve
