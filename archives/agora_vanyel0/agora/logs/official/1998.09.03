There are nine rebellious Players. 

They are: Blob, Crito, General Chaos, Harlequin, lee, Macross,
          Morendil, Murphy and Swann. 

Swann is the Miscreant so counts as two Rebellious Players in
determining the success of the Revolt.  

There are thus effectively 17 Players, and there is a 10/17 chance of
the revolt succeeding.

To determine this in a verifiable way, I take the whole part of the
Dow Jones closing price for yesterday and take the modulo of this
number by 17 and then add one to get a number in the range 1 -
17.  I determine this method before calculating the result.  

1-10 will be a success, 11 - 17 will be a failure. 

The closing price for 2 September 1998 is 7782.37. 

Thus the result of the calculation is 14.

The Revolt fails!

I hereby order Blob          to pay the Bank 2 Indulgences (RIPO31)
I hereby order Blob          to pay the Bank 2 Indulgences (RIPO32)
I hereby order Crito         to pay the bank 2 Indulgences (RIPO33)
I hereby order General Chaos to pay the Bank 2 Indulgences (RIPO34)
I hereby order Harlequin     to pay the Bank 2 Indulgences (RIPO35)
I hereby order lee           to pay the Bank 2 Indulgences (RIPO36)
I hereby order Macross       to pay the Bank 2 Indulgences (RIPO37)
I hereby order Morendil      to pay the Bank 2 Indulgences (RIPO38)
I hereby order Murphy        to pay the Bank 2 Indulgences (RIPO39)
I hereby order Swann         to pay the Bank 2 Indulgences (RIPO40)

Note that all of the above Players remain Rebellious.

Registrar Michael.

PS: I would like to use this random number determination method in
future, but I will subsequently use the price at the end of the next
day's trading after the Call for Revolt rather than one that a wannabe
Robespierre can check themselves.

Repeal-O-Matic Rule selection for Sep 4 1998
--------------------------------------------

There are 353 rules in the latest short logical ruleset.
Selecting five at random gives:

213 : Rule 417  ("Duties of the Archivist")
286 : Rule 1465 ("Champion's Reward")
330 : Rule 1617 ("Changing the Jurisdiction of an Organization's SLC")
 90 : Rule 1774 ("Discarding Proposals from the Queue")
161 : Rule 217  ("Judgements Must Accord with the Rules")

Well, I did 417 last week. This week, I think I'll pick R1465,
and I'll take out R755 along with it. Thus I hereby submit the
following Proposal, on behalf of the Repeal-O-Matic, as its Executor.

PROPOSAL: Repeal Rule 1465 (Champion's Reward)
          This Proposal shall have an AI = 1
          Rule 1465 is hereby Repealed.
	  Rule 755 is hereby Repealed.
