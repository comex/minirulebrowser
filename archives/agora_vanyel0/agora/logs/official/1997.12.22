OFF:  New Proposals: 3650-3655

There are six new proposals distributed as of this report.

======================================================================
D = Disinterested
d = Disowned
S = Silly
s = Sane
E = Emergency
 
   3650 Murphy     1 Declaration of Absence
   3651 G. Chaos   1 Loophole Avoidance
D  3652 G. Chaos 1.5 Kill the Damn Monster, Already
D  3653 G. Chaos   1 Innocent Error Defense
D  3654 G. Chaos   1 Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank
D  3655 G. Chaos   1 Fix Indulgence Distribution

======================================================================
Proposal 3650 (Murphy)  AI = 1
Declaration of Absence

Amend Rule 1715 to read:

      A Player may declare that e is PRESENT or ABSENT on a Proposal,
      Election or Referendum, by sending a message to that effect to
      the Vote Collector of this Proposal, Election or Referendum.

      Players who declare themselves PRESENT on a Proposal, Election
      or Referendum during the Voting Period of that Proposal,
      Election or Referendum are, solely for the purpose of
      determining Quorum, considered to have voted, but a Player who
      both declares emself PRESENT and also Votes on the Proposal,
      Election or Referendum is counted only once toward Quorum.

      Players who declare themselves ABSENT on a Proposal, Election
      or Referendum are not considered to have voted, unless they
      also do something else that causes em to be so considered.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which determine
      Quorum or whether a Proposal, Election or Referendum has met
      Quorum.

Amend Rule 452 by replacing the paragraph beginning "This Rule shall in
no way prohibit the Vote Collector" with this paragraph:

      This Rule shall in no way prohibit the Vote Collector from
      posting, at any time and to the Public Forum, a list of those
      Voting Entities which have already voted or declared Presence
      or Absence on a given Proposal, Election or Referendum.  If a
      Voting Entity has performed one of these actions in the Public
      Forum and has not performed any of these actions outside the
      Public Forum, then the Vote Collector is permitted to state that
      that Voting Entity has performed that action.  Otherwise, the Vote
      Collector is prohibited from specifying which of these actions
      a Voting Entity has performed.  The publication of a list as
      described in this Rule is not a Crime, unless specified as such
      by another Rule.

Amend Rule 683 by replacing "FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN" with "FOR or
AGAINST".

Amend Rule 1717 by replacing this paragraph:

      Entities other than Senators cannot Vote on Senate Proposals.
      If any Entity other than a Senator has already Voted on a
      Proposal by the time it becomes a Senate Proposal, their Votes
      on that Proposal change to ABSTAIN, and cannot change
      thereafter, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, and at the
      end of the Voting Period, the cost of casting those Votes is
      transferred to them.

with this paragraph:

      Entities other than Senators cannot Vote on Senate Proposals.  If
      any Entity other than a Senator has already Voted on a Proposal
      by the time it becomes a Senate Proposal, then both their Votes on
      that Proposal and any delayed Transfer Orders generated by those
      Votes are cancelled.

Amend Rule 1434 by replacing "FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN" with "FOR or
AGAINST".

Amend Rule 1663 by replacing "FOR, AGAINST and ABSTAIN" with "FOR and
AGAINST".
 
======================================================================
Proposal 3651 (G.Chaos)  AI = 1
Loophole Avoidance 

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1741 be amended, by appending to
it the paragraph:

      However, this Rule shall not apply to a Proposal if it would
      have the effect of prohibiting all Voting upon that Proposal.
 
======================================================================
Proposal 3652 (G.Chaos)  AI = 1.5  (Disinterested)
Kill the Damn Monster, Already 

WHEREAS, it has been amply demonstrated that the Frankenstein Mutator,
while occasionally amusing, has the overall effect of making the Game
consistently unplayable,

and WHEREAS, at least some of the Players of this Nomic prefer to have
some semblance of stability,

and WHEREAS, the confusion and complexities that the Frankenstein
Mutator introduces makes performing the duties of the various Offices
of the Game so tedious and complicated as to not be worth the effort,
thereby threatening to render the Game unplayable through lack of
recordkeeping,

BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED, that the following Rule be created with
Power 1.5 and the following text:

      Upon the creation of this Rule, Rules 1671, 1672, 1673, and 1674
      shall be repealed.  Once this has occured, this Rule shall
      repeal itself.

======================================================================
Proposal 3653 (G.Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Innocent Error Defense 

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1575 be amended, by appending a
paragraph reading 

      Furthermore, it is a defense to any accusation of a Crime that
      the Player reasonably believed that eir actions were not a
      Crime at the time e performed them, or that e reasonably did not
      know that e was required to perform an action, when such
      nonperformance is defined as a Crime.  No Player shall be
      convicted of a Crime if this defense applies.

======================================================================
Proposal 3654 (G.Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank

Be it therefore resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      If an entity transfers Currency to the Bank without specifying a
      purpose for doing so, or if e specifies a purpose for doing so,
      but the transfer fails to accomplish that purpose, the Bank
      shall, as soon as possible, transfer that Currency back to that
      entity.

======================================================================
Proposal 3655 (G.Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Fix Indulgence Distribution 

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1712 be amended to read:

      At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Herald shall randomly
      distribute a number of Indulgences equal to the number of Blots
      executed in the past Week, less the number of Blots vacated in
      the past Week, among all Players: for each such Indulgence, the
      Herald shall randomly select one Player and issue a Payment
      Order from the Bank to that Player for one Indulgence.  If this
      number is negative, no distribution occurs.

    Swann transfers one Kudo FROM G. Chaos TO Oerjan.

    I herby transfer a kudo from General Chaos to Oerjan, because
    repealing the FM Rule just because it has a temporary effect on
    Voting patterns is roughly akin to repealing the Virus because it
    made our lives difficult by infecting the TO Rule...I also applaud
    both Oerjan's attempt to address the concerns of some
    players, and being an all-in-all worthwhile Mad Scientist.

Date: Mon, 15 Dec 1997 15:42:53 -0500

    G. Chaos transfers one Kudo FROM Swann TO Michael.

The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of
a VOC directive was the report published in the PF on 1996/08/13
(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

AFAIK, no Herald's Report has ever been successfully ratified.

3. WILL REPORT
=============================================================

No Rule requires or prohibits that I disclose which entities have Wills, or
anything about a Will's text.  I do so solely for informational purposes.

Summaries of Wills are not guaranteed to be accurate.

All of the Wills marked (*) have ceased to exist for various reasons, and
are listed solely for historical purposes.

solely for informational purposes.

5. FRANKENSTEIN MONSTER REPORT

Maintainer or Jurisdiction of its SLC).  Each Player's Executor is emself;
no other Frankenstein Monster has an Executor.
