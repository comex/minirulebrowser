                               CFJ 1079

     "Zefram's objection to the plan for the termination of Calabresi's
      estate, in message <199801141153.LAA09691@taos.demon.co.uk>,
      lacks foundation."

======================================================================

Judge:       Blob
Judgement:   TRUE

Eligible:    Blob, Chuck, Crito, elJefe, General Chaos, Harlequin, Jester,
             Kolja A., Michael, Morendil, Murphy, Oerjan, Steve, Swann

Ineligible:
Caller:      Zefram (not a player)
Barred:
On request:
On hold:     Andre


======================================================================
History:

  Called by Zefram, 14 Jan 1998 12:16:23 +0000
  Assigned to Blob, 14 Jan 1998 21:44:09 +0000
  Judged TRUE, 19 Jan 1998 21:06:13 +1100

======================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

<none>


======================================================================
Judge's Arguments:

Rule 1738 defines foundation as follows:

      An objection to a Plan for disposition has foundation if it
      properly alleges that:
        a) the Plan constructed is not in accord with the provisions
           of the Probate Code;
        b) the Plan disregards the Will (if any) of the entity in
           Probate;
        c) the implementation of the Plan as constructed would be
           substantially unfair to a creditor or heir of the entity in
           Probate; or
        d) the Plan would not fully dispose of the estate of the
           entity in Probate.

Zefram's objection did not satisfy any of these criteria, so the
given statement is TRUE. (Appeal this one if you dare!)


======================================================================
Evidence provided by Judge:

Rule 1738/3 (Power=1)
Executors in Probate

      Whenever there is an entity in Probate which does not have an
      Trustee, the Notary shall nominate a Player to be that entity's
      Trustee.  E shall announce this appointment in the Public Forum.

      As soon as possible after the Notary announces the appointment
      of a Trustee for an entity in Probate, each Recordkeepor, with
      respect to the Currency of which e is the Recordkeepor, shall
      provide to that Trustee an accounting of the number of units of
      that Currency held by the entity in Probate, and a list of all
      Payment Orders naming the entity in Probate as either Payor or
      Payee.

      As soon as possible after the Trustee has received all of the
      reports required by the previous paragraph, e shall formulate
      and announce in the Public Forum a Plan for the disposition of
      the estate of the entity in Probate according to the provisions
      of the Probate Code.  However, if the Trustee determines, during
      the course of constructing the Plan, that any of the credits or
      debts of the entity in Probate is disputed, e shall announce
      this fact in the Public Forum, and shall neither formulate nor
      announce a Plan until after the dispute has been settled, and
      shall do so as soon as possible after the dispute has been
      settled.

      If no legally-made objection to the Plan is posted in the Public
      Forum during a waiting period of seven days following its
      announcement, the Trustee shall, as soon as possible after the
      expiration of thia waiting period, perform whatever steps are
      necessary to implement the Plan for disposition.  If there is a
      legally-made objection, the Trustee shall, as soon as possible
      after the objection is announced, formulate and announce a new
      Plan as above, repeating the process until there is no
      objection.

      However, if a CFJ is made alleging that an objection to a
      Trustee's Plan lacks foundation, then the Trustee shall neither
      formulate a new Plan nor implement the existing Plan until the
      CFJ is resolved.  If a CFJ finds that an objection lacks
      foundation, then the Trustee may proceed as if that objection
      had never been made, and any attempt to announce that same
      objection again is not legally made.

      An objection to a Plan for disposition has foundation if it
      properly alleges that:
        a) the Plan constructed is not in accord with the provisions
           of the Probate Code;
        b) the Plan disregards the Will (if any) of the entity in
           Probate;
        c) the implementation of the Plan as constructed would be
           substantially unfair to a creditor or heir of the entity in
           Probate; or
        d) the Plan would not fully dispose of the estate of the
           entity in Probate.

Well in that case...

I object to the plan for the termination of Calabresi's estate, on the
grounds that Probate sucks.

   3678 G. Chaos       1 Supremacy of the Rules
   3679 G. Chaos       1 Holidays

======================================================================
Proposal 3670 (Swann)  AI = 1
Inform the Assessor whence come yer Votes

Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: Attributing Additional Votes)

     For each vote beyond the first two an entity casts on a particular 
     Proposal, that entity must provide to the Assessor the Rule Numbers 
     of the Rules that permit the casting of that additional vote.  If 
     these Rule Numbers are not provided to the Assessor before the end 
     of the voting period for that Proposal, the Assessor has the option
     to not count more than two votes on that Proposal from that entity.

{Comment: I want to add a number of Rules that allow entities to cast 
          additional votes, so I thought that this might make the 
          Assessor's life easier.}
 
======================================================================
Proposal 3671 (Swann)  AI = 1
Officer's Veto

Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: The Officer's Vote)

     If a particular Proposal amends the duties or description of a 
     particular Office, and a Player holds that Office in normal 
     fashion, and that Player is not the same Player who Proposed the 
     Proposal, then that Player may cast two additional votes on that 
     Proposal beyond what e is otherwise entitled to cast.  This shall 
     not increase the maximum number of votes that are permitted to be
     cast by that Player.

{Comment: Pretty self-explanatory.  It's meant to give an Officer a
          little more voice in the running of eir job.}

======================================================================
Proposal 3672 (Repeal-O-Matic)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Repeal Rule 1700

Rule 1700 is hereby repealed.

======================================================================
Proposal 3673 (Steve)  AI = 1
Tweak R1465 (Champion's Reward)

[Comment: R1465 was incompletely pragmatized by PC: strictly speaking,
it is impossible for the Registrar to pay out the VTs 'at the onset'
of the Champion's Reward.]

Be it hereby resolved that R1465 (Champion's Reward) be amended by
replacing the text

      At the onset of that Player's Champion's Reward, the Registrar
      shall pay out ten VTs to that Player.

with the text

      As soon as possible after the legal and correct announcement
      that a Player has won a Game, the Registrar shall pay out ten
      Voting Tokens to that Player.

======================================================================
Proposal 3674 (Steve)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Real VT scarcity *now*

[Comment: as promised, a proto for real VT scarcity, now. I've opted
for direct VT destruction for getting VTs back, rather than the much
more complex issuing of POs by the Chancellor, which would require
each Executor to make a Transfer Order returning their VTs to the
Bank. The paying out of VTs can be done simply by issuing TOs from
the Bank by the Chancellor, though, so I've opted for that. I note
that PC appears to have negated that effects of reforming R594: we're
back to the situation where you need to propose self-repealing Rules
to make game state changes by Proposal.]

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule be created with the following text:

      Upon the creation of this Rule, all Voting Tokens are
      destroyed. Furthermore, as soon as possible after the creation
      of this Rule, the Chancellor shall, for each Player, execute a
      Transfer Order for five Voting Tokens, naming the Bank as
      payor, and that Player as the payee.

      This Rule shall repeal itself as soon as the Chancellor
      has executed the Transfer Orders required by it.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would
      prevent VTs from being destroyed.

======================================================================
Proposal 3675 (Michael)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
The Rulekeepor should have an Official Report

Amend Rule 1051 "The Office of the Rulekeepor" by replacing the second
paragraph with the following text:

      The Rulekeepor shall maintain a complete list of all Rules.  The
      Short Logical Ruleset constitutes the Rulekeepor's Official
      Report. In addition, the Rulekeepor shall post the Full Logical
      Ruleset to the Public Forum at least once each month.

======================================================================
Proposal 3676 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1
Evidentiary status of Officer Reports

Be it therefore resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      The published Report of an Officer constitutes prima facie
      evidence of the truth of those matters reported therein which
      that Officer is required by law to report.  This presumption may
      be set aside only by clear and convincing evidence to the
      contrary.

======================================================================
Proposal 3677 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1
Requirement of evidentiary basis for findings of fact

Be it therefore resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      No Judge shall base any judgement upon any fact not justified by
      sufficient evidence.  In no case shall any fact be admitted
      without evidence, excepting those facts which are clearly
      commonly known.

======================================================================
Proposal 3678 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1
Supremacy of the Rules

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1513 be retitled "Supremacy of the
Rules" and amended to read:

      These Rules are the supreme law of this Nomic.  The Rules may
      establish and ordain other bodies of law, and require Players to
      abide by and obey them.  Such bodies of law are part of the
      law of this Nomic, to the extent that they do not conflict with
      the Rules.

      In any circumstance where both the Rules and another body of law
      have conflicting application, the Rules shall govern.

      In any circumstance where two or more bodies of law, neither of
      which is the Rules, have conflicting application, that body of
      law involved which was first established and ordained by the
      Rules as governing law shall govern.

======================================================================
Proposal 3679 (G. Chaos)  AI = 2
Holidays

Be it therefore resolved, that the following Rule be created, at Power
2:

      A Holiday is a period of time, not to exceed 7 days in length,
      designated as such by the Rules.  If one Holiday begins
      within 24 hours of the end of another Holiday, the two Holidays
      and the time between them are taken as a single Holiday, unless
      this would cause the combined Holiday to exceed 7 days in
      length, in which case the first Holiday is extended to 7 days
      and the second Holiday does not occur.

      During a Holiday, no Proposal may be distributed by the
      Promotor, nor may any Call for Judgement, Judgement, notice of
      Appeal, Decision of Appeals Boards, or Opinion be published by
      the Clerk of the Courts; however, if any of the above do take
      place during the Holiday in violation of this Rule, this Rule
      does not deprive them of their usual effects.  

      If some Rule requires that an action be done prior to a
      given time, and that given time falls during a Holiday, or
      within the twenty-four-hour period immediately following that
      Holiday, then that action need not be done until twenty-four
      hours after that Holiday ends.  If some Rule bases the time of a
      future event upon the time of another event, or requires that a
      Player perform some action within some time of another event,
      and that event occurs during a Holiday, the time at which the
      Holiday ends shall be used instead for the purpose of
      determining the time of the future event or of the time by which
      the Player must perform the specified action.  

      This Rule takes precedence over all Rules pertaining to the
      timing of events, and over all Rules which require Players to
      perform events before a specified time.

The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of
a VOC directive was the report published in the PF on 1996/08/13
(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

I therefore voted for INP357 and against INP358 and INP359.


2. Moderator fun

At the moment it is not quite clear who is moderator: Malenkai had
resigned and appointed Uri Bruck as successor, with the reason that
Malenkai deregistered as a player in Ackanomic.

However, a CFJ in Acka seems to challenge this deregistration, so e
may still be a player there, after all. Within Acka this has created
some activity, because Malenkai used to be responsible for assigning
CFJs or some such thing, so the game state may split depending on
whether e is judged to be a player or not. (If you're interested and
have web access, check out
<http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/acka/cfjs/cfj520.html>
for the CFJ). 

On the IN list there have been no official statements on the reolution
of this, yet.

Also, recent voting results (e.g. on INP 357) have not yet been
announced.
