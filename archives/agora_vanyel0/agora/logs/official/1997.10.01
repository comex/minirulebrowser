Effective 1997-10-01T00:00:00Z, a quarterly Speaker change takes place.
Speaker-Elect Steve became Speaker at that time, without need for the
three-way handshake.

The Office of Speaker-Elect is now to be filled temporarily, in accordance
with the Order of Succession, with Speaker Steve as Arbiter of Succession.
Initially, Promotor Crito holds the Office.

Chuck

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

======================================================================

Complete text of the mail in which the CFJ was called (I am obliged
to publish this with this CFJ, I think)

I do not dismiss CFJ 962 per 1565/iii ("Its Statement does not relate to a
matter relevant to the Rules").  The Statement of CFJ 962 obviously relates
to CFJ 962 itself, which is a matter relevant to the Rules.  (If this
argument is to be believed, then no CFJ may be dismissed per 1565/iii,
which should therefore be reworded.)

However, I do dismiss CFJ 962 on the following grounds:

* 1565/vi:   After a reasonable effort by the Judge to obtain all relevant
               information, no determination can be made of the truth or
               falsity of its Statement.
* 1563:      Its Statement is unable to be determined by the means of
               logical reasoning, with the presumption of perfect knowledge,
               to be either TRUE or FALSE.

I interpret these clauses as they were surely intended, namely "no
determination can be made as to whether or not its Statement is true"
and "It is impossible to determine ... whether or not its Statement is
true", as opposed to the alternate convoluted interpretations that have
recently been offered.

I dismiss CFJ  978, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ  982, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ  984, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ  989, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ  990, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ  994, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1019, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1021, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1022, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1026, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1027, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1032, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1036, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1043, on the same grounds.

I'll take my 45 Mil in 5-Mark notes, please.  :)

I hereby Call For Judgement on the following Statement:

     This statement is false.

  Judged TRUE by Chuck 26 Sep 1997 02:10:39 -0500
======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

I judge CFJ 944 to be TRUE.

R&A:

First, I should note that I take "designated" in the statement
to mean "designated, with legal significance" rather than just
designated by some random person.

There are two issues at hand here: first, does 108 prohibit
only direct retroactive effects of Rule Changes--the Changes
themselves--or does it prohibit indirect retroactive effects
as well, e.g. new effects of Rules changed by a Rule Change,
taking effect before the Rule Change which specified that form
of the Rule?

I would argue that both Game Custom and the best interests of
the game require us to interpret it as the latter--indirect
as well as direct retroactive effects of Rule Changes are
prohibited.  However, because of my finding on the second issue
(below), this point is actually irrelevant to this Judgement.

The second issue is whether the effect described in this CFJ
is, in fact, such an indirect retroactive effect.  It is not.
The mere designation of a time period as a certain term does
not necessarily take place during that time period.  In this
case, the period in question is from the distribution of a
proposal until ten days afterwards; but that does not, in 
this case, take effect at the commencement of that period--it
takes place when 693 is disinfected.  To put it another way,
it is important to distinguish between the time period which
is designated, and the time at which the designation takes effect.
For the designation to take place after the commencement of
the period is awkward, to be sure, it is not retroactive.

To make a slightly clearer analogy: it would be perfectly legal
and effective to enact a Rule which stated, "July 4, 1776 is
the birthday of the United States."  Before the enactment
of the Rule, July 4, 1776 has no special designation.  Afterwards,
it is designated as the birthday of the U.S.  Since the
designation does not take effect until the Rule does, this
is not a retroactive effect.

What implications this may have for actually voting on proposals
as described in this CFJ is an issue I have not yet analyzed, and
thus decline to comment on at this time.

Chuck

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments (slighted edited):

See my argument above concerning retroactive rule effects.  Another
example may help (which is why I worded the CFJ as I did).  The disinfection of
R693 can be seen as assigning an historical significance to the ten days
following the distribution of each of these proposals.  It is like passing a
rule now which says, "September 1, 1997 through September 7, 1997 shall be
known as 'The Week of the Cumberbuns'".  This would retroactively give a
significance to those days, an effect which, I contend, is not prohibited by
R108.

'my argument above' is pointing to the following text (this line is
an insertion by the CotC):

History:

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Rule 911 states in part:

      A Player is ineligible for selection if any of the following is
      true:

       iv) E was ineligible to Judge the CFJ that resulted in the
           matter under consideration, and this restriction does not
           prevent three eligible Players from being selected by the
           CotC for the Board.

CFJ 933 was called on Aug 4, a week before Calabresi registered to
play. Calabresi was, therefore, ineligible to Judge the CFJ, and so
satisfies the criterion of R911(iv) for being ineligible to serve
as Justice.

Andre has argued that Calabresi was later eligible to serve as a
Judge when the CFJ was re-assigned after the initial Judge defaulted.
This is true, but it no way changes the fact that Calabresi was, at
one time, ineligible to serve as Judge, and so is ineligible to serve
as Justice. R911 does not say that a Player who was never eligible
to serve as Judge is ineligible to serve as Justice.

In the matter of CFJ 963, I hereby dismiss the CFJ on the grounds
that logical reasoning, even with perfect knowledge, cannot show
whether the Statement is TRUE or FALSE. R1563 therefore requires me
to dismiss the CFJ. In addition, the Statement does not relate to a
matter relevant to the Rules, and is therefore the CFJ is to be
dismissed under R1565(iii).  Nor, having obtained all the relevant
information, am I able to determine whether the Statement is true or
false. The CFJ is therefore also to be dismissed under R1565(vi).

(Caller's) Arguments:

> You would prefer that I ignore the obvious and direct meaning as

> indirect meaning as being 2 Transfer Orders for 2 VTs each? 
> Please. COE denied.  Further, I transfer one Kudo from Morendil for
> making such a baseless COE, to Harlequin, for being the unfortunate
> victim of circumstance. 

For one thing, that is precisely what I expect you to do - the Courts
have been working overtime to establish that implicit specifications
in the wording of Orders were to be given due consideration, and
Harlequin's request for a transfer is worded so that it was well
within your authority, given this judicial basis, to interpret it as
two successful distinct TOs. Note that Harlequin's request did not
purport to be one TO for 4 VTs, but merely requested that you note a
Transfer or Transfers for a total of 4 VTs; given that the POs this
aimed to satisfy were explicitly listed, your contention that the
'obvious and direct' intent was as a TO for an amount of 4 VTs
simply makes no sense.

For another thing, "unfortunate victim of circumstance", together
with your statement that "The Bank gratefully appreciates your
donation", strikes me as very cynical.

I'll let the Agoran community take appropriate steps, if they so
wish, to compensate for the injurious Kudo transfer above; however,
your behaviour as an Officer should be subject to formal scrutiny
and I therefore submit the following CFJ :

===
General Chaos committed the Crime of Wrongful COE denial.

Reasoning and Arguments Judge:

Welcome to the shady statistics seminar.

I made the following approximate table of Proposals based on
information in the Logical Ruleset:

40      Aug. 1993 - Sep. 1993
110     Sep. 1993 - Oct. 1993

28      Sep. 1996 - Oct. 1996
53      Oct. 1996 - Nov. 1996
34      Nov. 1996 - Dec. 1996

30      May. 1997 - Jun. 1997
30      Jun. 1997 - Jul. 1997
16      Jul. 1997 - Aug. 1997

When I replace those >200 events (I assume these are chromatic repeals
and Crito's Scam, all of which are discouraged under our current
system) with the average of the neighboring months, I get
approximately

40 + 110 + 149 + 87 + 39 + 33 + 21 + 36 + 29 + 28 + 55 + 20 + 53 +
56.5 + 60 + 3 + 47 + 39 + 83 + 47 + 12 + 17 + 31 + 44 + 36 + 55 + 55 +
44 + 44 + 54 + 63 + 25 + 30 + 13 + 18 + 10 + 28 + 53 + 34 + 11 + 21 +
26 + 20.5 + 15 + 30 + 30 + 16

= 1871 Proposals.

dividing this by 4*52 gives 9 Proposals per week on average.

Assuming a Poisson distribution this gives (now where is my statistics
table?) (starting up MapleV) (repeated tries)

> add(evalf((9^i)/i!*exp(-9))*min(8,floor(i*2/3)),i=0..100);
                                  5.533333273

5.5333 VTs per week in average Voting stipend.

>From a recent Salary Report (Zefram, 23 Sep 1997) I see that the total
amount of Officer Salaries in the game is

2.0+1.0+3.0+1.0+1.0+2.0+1.0+1.0+1.0+1.5+1.5+2.0+1.0
= 19 VT per Week.

There are, according to the most recent Registrar's Report, 20 Active
Players.  This means a Voting stipend total of 110 VTs per Week.

With half the Players being Officers this implies a VT distribution of
slightly above 4:3 between Officers:Others.

This seems low in my opinion. 3:2 would be more reasonable. To achieve
this, salaries could be increased to a total of 110/4 = 27.5 VTs.

Dividing this amount by 13 Offices gives an average of 2.1 VTs per
Officer. This is approximately the CotC's current salary.

Looking at Michael's "recent CFJs" report, I see
CFJ 929 (called on Wed, 16 Jul 1997 08:47:14 +0100)
CFJ 872 (called on 21 May 1996 05:45 UTC)
These are 60 weeks apart, and 57 apart in number.
So there is about 1 CFJ per week.

I would estimate the following Officers to have a higher workload than the
CotC:

Archivist (archives all posts to the PF, and treat some specially)
Assessor (handles all Proposals + VTs)
Chancellor (handles a lot of transactions)
Herald (handles Kudos + Indulgences)
Promotor (handles all Proposals + PNs)
Rulekeepor (must react to many Proposals + the Virus)

These are borderline:

Registrar
Wizard

and the following seem to have lower workload:

Ambassador (Internomic is slow-moving at best)
Cartographor (people don't move that often)
Mad Scientist (although produces report, has a solitary job)
Notary (data change rarely)

The CotC seems to be an average Office, and so should have an average
Salary.

Therefore, I Judge FALSE.

Greetings,
Oerjan.

(Caller's) Arguments:

At least when there are some VTs in the Bank, they'll have someplace 
to go - judicial salaries, y'know : -)

  Judged TRUE by Morendil, 30 Sep 1997 17:51:10 +0100

============================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

In CFJ 1045, I find the Statement to be TRUE.

I am in essential agreement with the Caller that Rule 1563 provides
more than adequate justification for Dismissing the named CFJs, in
spite of some arduous wording which made it briefly tempting - given
the rewards of returning a Judgement on, rather than Dismiss, these
CFJs - to wriggle my way out of it.


But wait, there is more.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the sum total of
Payment Orders in Indulgences naming that Player as Payor that they
have thus far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the sum total of Payment
Orders in Voting Tokens naming that Player as Payor that they have
thus far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Proposal Notes equal to the sum total of
Payment Orders in Indulgences naming that Player as Payor that they
have thus far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to the Registrar, requiring em to issue, for each Player, a
Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, that Player as Payee, for an
amount of 5 VTs. (So we can Vote on Proposals, y'know...)

The above facially satisfy provisions i) through iv) of Rule 663
pertaining to Injunctions; it is my belief that they also satisfy v), 
though that requires us to examine any Rule relevant thereto. I
find one, Rule 1736 itself, which states

      The Rules may require, in certain cases, that a Judge issue an
      Injunction ordering the execution of a Payment Order.  If the
      Payment Order required by such an Injunction is executed, and
      the Injunction itself later set aside, the Player who executed
      the required Payment Order shall, as soon as possible after the
      Injunction was set aside, vacate that Payment Order.

This merely states that Rules are permitted to require Judges to
issue Injuctions under certain circumstances; it is as far as I can
see no bar to a Judge taking it upon emself to issue any legal
Injuction. No prohibition of any kind in fact obtains with respect
to issuing Injuctions defined in 1736/1737; the procedure for issuing
an Injunction is well delineated, and followed to a T in this
Judgement; issuing an Injunctions in the present circumstances is 
therefore possible and unprohibited, which I submit is all that 'in a 
manner consistent with the Rules' requires.

Lastly, a note as to intent - obviously, this loophole can be used
for massive personal gain (well, once the status of Currencies has
been determined), and just as obviously it will be extremely tempting
for other Players assigned to Judge CFJs to take advantage of it for
the same reasons. It could also be used to summarily deregister 
anyone from the Game by assigning them 31 Blots.

There is no limit to how far this could be abused; if everyone jumps
on that bandwagon, all we will do is spoil the game absolutely.
Better we should fix that loophole, and quick, and refrain from
doing anything else about it for the sake of preserving the game's
fun.

I think the above is even-handed enough that Players (especially
Justices or Judges with CFJs currently assigned to em) will see their
own interest in letting it stand at that.

(And remember, you ain't seen nothing yet.)

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:


Relevant Rules: 1563

Rule 1563/1 (Power=1)
Statement of a CFJ

      In order to be Judged, a Call for Judgement must contain a
      single clearly-labeled Statement which must be able to be
      determined by the means of logical reasoning, with the
      presumption of perfect knowledge, to be either TRUE or FALSE.
      Statements which are inherently contradictory or which are
      vacuous are not acceptable, and a CFJ containing such a
      Statement shall not be Judged.

      If a Call for Judgement does not contain a Statement of the sort
      required by this Rule, its Judge is required to dismiss the CFJ,
      as described elsewhere.

      It is permitted for a Call for Judgement to contain Arguments,
      Evidence, or other material placed there at the Caller's
      discretion.  However, the Judge is not required to take notice
      of any part of the CFJ other than the Statement in formulating
      eir Judgement.

Before I begin arguing, I'd like to say that when I refer to "the
statement", I refer to the statement "This statement is TRUE.", and when I
refer to "the CFJ", I'm referring to the CFJ I am submitting.  I'm keeping
this consistancy so that it's clear what I am talking about.

The statement "This statement is TRUE." cannot be determined to be either
TRUE or FALSE by means of logical reasoning.

If the statement is TRUE, then it follows that the statement is TRUE, and
there's no contradiction.  If the statement is FALSE, then it follows that
the statement is FALSE, and there's no contradiction.  Therefore, the
statement is both TRUE and FALSE and is not either TRUE or FALSE.

The statement is also vacuous, and is therefore not acceptable.

vacuous (vàk´y¡-es) adjective
1.	Devoid of matter; empty.
2.	a. Lacking intelligence; stupid. b. Devoid of substance or meaning;
inane: a vacuous comment. c. Devoid of expression; vacant: "The narrow,
swinelike eyes were open, no more vacuous in death than they had been in
life" (Nicholas Proffitt).
3.	Lacking serious purpose or occupation; idle. See synonyms at EMPTY.
[From Latin vacuus, empty. See VACUUM.]
- vac´uously adverb
- vac´uousness noun

The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Third Edition
copyright © 1992 by Houghton Mifflin Company. Electronic version licensed
from InfoSoft International, Inc. All rights reserved.

definitions 2b, 2c, and 3 all support the statement being vacuous.
definition 1 would imply an empty statement, like a null set, but then
there would be no statement to be vacuous, so definition 1 does not apply.
definition 2a is a matter of taste, so it does not apply.

The statement has not substance or meaning in game terms or in terms of
anything other than the statement.

I'd like to also note that this CFJ must be judged TRUE if it is determined
by the judge that the statement cannot be judged TRUE or FALSE by logical
reasoning or the statement is vacuous.  Either one of those being TRUE (or
both being true) makes this CFJ true.
