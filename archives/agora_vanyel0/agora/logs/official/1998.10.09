   3794 Kolja          1 Indulgence tax after successful rebellion
   3795 Blob           1 Allow Free Voting...

======================================================================

Proposal 3794 (Kolja) AI = 1
Indulgence tax after successful rebellion

1. Introduce the tax

Amend R1664 by inserting the text

         - The Registrar is empowered and required to levy a tax of 
           75% on indulgences. The holder of the Patent Title 
           "Robespierre" is exempt from this tax, even if other rules
           don't allow tax exemptions.

after the existing text

         - The Registrar shall pay out 2 VTs to each Rebellious
           Player.


2. Levy a one-off indulgence tax

Create a new rule with the text

 As soon as possible after the creation of this rule, the Herald shall
 levy a tax of 80% on indulgences.

 This rule is automatically repealed two weeks after it is created.


3. Allow taxes of more than 50% 

[Comment: This tax only makes sense if it is close to 100%, as it aims
to offset the effect of a 100% destruction of blots.]

Amend R1853 by replacing the text

      The announcement must specify which Currency the tax in
      being levied on (and this must be a Currency on which the Player
      making the announcement is empowered to levy a tax), and the
      amount of the levy, expressed as a percentage of holdings of
      that Currency, not in excess of fifty percent, which each
      entity in possession of that Currency will be required to pay
      to the Bank (the levy must be the same for all entities).

with 

 The announcement must specify which Currency the tax in
 being levied on (and this must be a Currency on which the Player
 making the announcement is empowered to levy a tax), and the amount
 of the levy, expressed as a percentage of holdings of that Currency,
 which each entity in possession of that Currency will be required to
 pay to the Bank (the levy must be the same for all entities). Unless
 the rule(s) authorizing a particular tax explicitly say so, the amount
 of the levy of that tax may never be larger than 50%.


Appendix: Small, and hopefully uncontroversial IN fixes, appended to
this proposal to save money.

A1. Reduce the IN awards to realistic levels.

Amend R1748 by replacing the text

       ii) In the case where the InterNomic Proposal fails, but Agora
           did vote FOR it, the award shall be one Voting Token.
      iii) In the case where the InterNomic Proposal passes, the award
           shall be five Voting Tokens and two Proposal Notes.

with 

       ii) In the case where the InterNomic Proposal fails, but Agora
           did vote FOR it, the award shall be 0.5 Voting Tokens.
      iii) In the case where the InterNomic Proposal passes, the award
           shall be one Voting Token and one Proposal Note.


A2. Allow the ambassador to vote on uninteresting/uncontroversial IN
proposals.

Amend R1632 by replacing the text

      If the Referendum on that Proposal is
      undecided, then the Ambassador may decide how Agora votes,
      as e sees fit.

with 

      If the Referendum on that Proposal is undecided or has not 
      reached quorum, then the Ambassador may decide how Agora votes,
      as e sees fit.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal 3795 (Blob) AI = 1
Allow Free Voting (at the Assessor's Discretion)

Amend Rule 1862 (The Voting Tariff) by replacing the text
"between 0.5 and 2.0 inclusive" with "between 0 and 2 inclusive".

[Comment: Some players want to bring back free voting. Rather than 
 eliminate the entire pay-for-vote system, we can simply give the
 Assessor the power to make all voting free, for a period of time.
 Of course doing so will dramatically cut eir Commission, but that
 shouldn't bother the free-for-voters, as there would be no need for
 the Assessor to earn VTs in the first place. :)]
