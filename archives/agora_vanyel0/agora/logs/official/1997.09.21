Agora Nomic
Mad Scientist's Report

Date of this Report: Sun, 21 September 1997


STEP 1: SENTENCE DELETION
=========================

As of this date, there were 12 sentences between the first and last
paragraphs of the Frankenstein Rule. N is thus equal to 1. In
accordance to Rule 1673, I randomly selected 2N sentences. The
sentences selected were sentences 5 and 9, which read:

      If a Frankenstein Monster is defined as a Voting Entity then
      it is permitted to cast Voting Tokens on Proposals as if it
      were a Player.

I selected sentence 9 to be deleted.

{Comments:

This sentence has already had its chance to do something 
interesting -- the CFJ is *still* in the courts! Either way, though, 
it's useless now -- either it gave Murphy a Win and then deleted
itself, or it didn't work and thus doesn't need to remain in
the Rule.
}

STEP 2: SENTENCE ADDITION
=========================

As per Rule 1673, I randomly selected one Rule from the Ruleset. The
Rule selected was Rule 1700, which reads:

####
Rule 1700/0 (Power=1)
Defense of Marriage Act

      Any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, no action
      which is legal or permitted by the Rules when attempted
      by one set of Players shall be illegal or forbidden by
      the Rules when attempted by a different set of Players,
      due solely to the sexes (or lack thereof) of the Players
      involved.
####

I selected the sentence

      Any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, no action
      which is legal or permitted by the Rules when attempted
      by one set of Players shall be illegal or forbidden by
      the Rules when attempted by a different set of Players,
      due solely to the sexes (or lack thereof) of the Players
      involved.

I selected the noun "sexes."

The sentence to be added to the Frankenstein Rule reads:

      Any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, no action
      which is legal or permitted by the Rules when attempted
      by one set of Players shall be illegal or forbidden by
      the Rules when attempted by a different set of Players,
      due solely to the Frankenstein Monsters (or lack thereof) 
      of the Players involved.

The Frankenstein Rule now reads:

####

Rule 1671/43 (Power=1)
The Frankenstein Rule

      There is a Nomic Entity known as a Frankenstein Monster.  A
      Frankenstein Monster only has properties and effects as defined
      in this Rule.  This Rule shall be known as the Frankenstein
      Rule, and can be referred to unambiguously in that manner.  This
      is the first paragraph.

      This Frankenstein Monster, while it exists, shall guide
      application of that Rule.

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of any message sent to the Public Forum or
      in response to a request for information which that Player is
      required to provide commits the Crime of Frankenstein Monster, a
      Class C Crime.

      If that Player's Frankenstein Monster contains at least five Mil
      for each Blot to be removed, then that number of Mil is
      transferred from the Player's Frankenstein Monster, and the
      Blots are removed; otherwise, no Mil are transferred and no
      Blots are removed.

      The Frankenstein Monster shall make all random determinations
      required by the Rules except when the Rules specify another
      party to make the determination.

      If a Frankenstein Monster is defined as a Voting Entity then
      it is permitted to cast Voting Tokens on Proposals as if it
      were a Player.

      The Frankenstein Monster may require, in certain cases, that a
      Judge issue an Injunction ordering that a Payment Order be
      vacated.

      If a Player Executes an Application, claiming that the
      Application contains the signature of one or more Players who
      have in fact not signed it, e commits the Frankenstein Monster
      of Application Fraud, a Class D Frankenstein Monster.

      A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.

      Frankenstein Monsters are permitted to submit Statements for
      Judgement to the Game of InterNomic.

      If a Proposal is adopted which, as part of all of its effect,
      repeals one or more Rules, and, immediately prior to the
      adoption of this Proposal there were more than 100 Rules, the
      Frankenstein Monster shall pay out 3 P-Notes to the Proposer
      of that Proposal.

      A Contest's Administrator is that Contest's Frankenstein
      Monster.

      This is the last paragraph. This Rule can only be subject to a
      Rule Change as described by the Frankenstein Generator.  This
      Rule takes precedence over all other Rules that would otherwise
      allow this Rule to be changed in any manner whatsoever.

      Any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, no action
      which is legal or permitted by the Rules when attempted
      by one set of Players shall be illegal or forbidden by
      the Rules when attempted by a different set of Players,
      due solely to the Frankenstein Monsters (or lack thereof) 
      of the Players involved.
