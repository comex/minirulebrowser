Because of General Chaos' Action, I must now exploit a
loophole in a Rule I didn't want to scam;

I quote
> Rule 1830/0 (Power=1)
> No Compulsion of Judges
> 
>       No valid Order to Compel may be directed to a Judge, or may
>       require the performance of any duty required of Player by the
>       virtue of that Player being a Judge.  Any such Order is invalid.
>       Any CFJ alleging that a Judge has failed to perform a duty of a
>       judicial nature shall be dismissed.
> 

The flaw in this rule is it is based upon the status of the
Player being so Ordered, not on the Order.  It also only prohibits
the compelling of Judicial *action*  it allows the compelling of
judicial *inaction*  I could have ordered everyone to refrain from
Judging FALSE, and to refrain from dismissing a given CFJ, but that's
the nomic equivalent of a weapon of mass destruction.

So, instead I restrain myself to a limited response.

Since no Player is yet Judge in the CFJ in Question;

I hereby Order Player Antimater, to refrain from granting any
and all Motions to stay or vacate the orders in the Coup d'etat
message, nor shall e grant any motions to punish Swann for such Orders.
E is also ordered to refrain from issuing such Orders under eir own

I hereby Order Player Citro, to refrain from granting any
and all Motions to stay or vacate the orders in the Coup d'etat
message, nor shall e grant any motions to punish Swann for such Orders.
E is also ordered to refrain from issuing such Orders under eir own

I hereby Order Player elJefe, to refrain from granting any

Statement: The orders issued by Swann in the message to the PF entitled
           "Here we go..." were legal and valid Orders.

Barred: General Chaos.

Reasons and Arguments:

For the basic valitity of a private transfer order I refer the Judge to
the Reasons and Arguments of the first Coup d'etat CFJ. (qv)

For the validity of the current statement, there are only two
rules that would impose additional restrictions on these Orders.
These are Rules 1796 and 1830.

The apparently strong Rule 1830;
 
>       No valid Order to Compel may be directed to a Judge, or may
>       require the performance of any duty required of Player by the
>       virtue of that Player being a Judge.  Any such Order is invalid.
>       Any CFJ alleging that a Judge has failed to perform a duty of a
>       judicial nature shall be dismissed.

There are a number of flaws here.  One, it is arguable that one can
compel Judical actions as long as the Player comelled is not a Judge
at the time, which none of the Players in the Orders in question were. 
Two, the rule makes no refernce to Orders that phrohibit action (ie. An
order not to Judge FALSE) which is the form in which the Orders in
question were cast.  Three, the most devistating flaw, this rule refers
*only* to Orders to Compel-- a specific type of Order defined in Rule
1509;
 
>       Upon a judicial finding that a Player has failed to perform a
>       duty required of em by the Rules, the Judge so finding shall
>       execute an Order, requiring that Player to perform that duty as
>       soon as possible.  Such an Order is known as an Order to
>       Compel.
> 

It is unquestionably true that the Orders in question were *not* Orders
to Compel as defined in the rules, and therefore 1830 does not apply at
all.

The other rule that applies is Rule 1796;

>       Furthermore, no Order may act to prevent or hinder its own
>       appeal in any way, and any portion of an Order which has this
>       effect is void and without force.

This is much simpler.  None of the Orders in question hinder their *own*
appeal, they only hinder the appeal of other Orders, which is not
forbidden.

Given these facts, I believe that the Judge has no question but to rule
these Orders valid.
======================================================================
Evidence:


Rule 1796/0 (Power=1)
Validity of Orders

      All Orders executed in the manner prescribed by the Rules for
      their class and type are presumed valid and enforceable until
      proven otherwise by CFJ.

      In order to be proven valid by CFJ, the Rules must permit the
      Player who executed the Order in question to execute such an
      Order, that the execution of the Order must have been required
      by or permitted in the circumstances which existed at the time
      it was executed, and that the Order has not been rendered
      invalid by the operation of any other Rule.

      Furthermore, no Order may act to prevent or hinder its own
      appeal in any way, and any portion of an Order which has this
      effect is void and without force.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1509/3 (Power=1)
Orders to Compel

      Upon a judicial finding that a Player has failed to perform a
      duty required of em by the Rules, the Judge so finding shall
      execute an Order, requiring that Player to perform that duty as
      soon as possible.  Such an Order is known as an Order to
      Compel.

      If the duty in question arises because the Player in question
      holds a specific Office or other position of official
      responsibility, the Order shall be directed to that Office or
      position.  If the Player holding that Office fails to perform
      the duty in question as ordered, the Judge shall Order that that
      Player be removed from Office or position.

      If the duty in question arises for a reason not related to the
      Player in question holding a specific Office or official
      position, and that Player fails to perform the duty as ordered,
      the Judge shall amend the Order to require the Speaker to
      perform that duty instead.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1830/0 (Power=1)
No Compulsion of Judges

      No valid Order to Compel may be directed to a Judge, or may
      require the performance of any duty required of Player by the
      virtue of that Player being a Judge.  Any such Order is invalid.
      Any CFJ alleging that a Judge has failed to perform a duty of a
      judicial nature shall be dismissed.

> 
> -----------------------------------------------------------------------
> Barred: General Chaos
> -----------------------------------------------------------------------
> Reasons and Arguments:
> 
> Part I: What is an Order and was Swann's post a series of Orders?
> 
> >From Rule 1793;
> 
>      "An Order is a command, executed by a Player and directed to some
>       entity requiring that entity to perform exactly one action, or
>       to refrain from performing one or more actions."
> 
> In addition, Rule 1794 (qv) defines several classes of orders.  Of the 
> four classes so defined, the Orders Swann issued would be classified as 
> private, in that they were not issued under the authority of a Judge, 
> Justice, or an Officer.  Nowhere in the Rules-- and pointedly so given 
> the pragmatic intent of the Rules in question-- is there a Rule that 
> would prevent any communication fulfilling the criteria of Rule 1793 
> from being an Order, and therefore having the characteristics the Rules 
> ascribe to Orders in general.  This means that _any_ communication 
> fulfilling 1793's criteria is an Order.  Since the communication 
> referred to in the statement was a series of commands, executed by a 
> Player (Swann) to individual entities (Players notified through the 
> Public Forum, which by definition goes to every Player) requiring those 
> entities to refrain from performing one or more actions (i.e., refrain 
> from issuing any Order of a type not explicitly defined by the Rules, 
> and refrain from issuing any Order that the Player is not explicitly 
> empowered by the Rules to issue.)  Given the nature of the Rules 
> governing Orders, I believe that it is self-evident that the 
> communication involved was a series of Orders. (The Rules governing 
> Orders are written to provide for anyone to issue an Order, the only 
> legal recourse is the determination of the Order's validity.)
> 
> Part II: Were these Orders Valid?
> 
> The relevant portion from Rule 1796;
> 
>       In order to be proven valid by CFJ, the Rules must permit the
>       Player who executed the Order in question to execute such an
>       Order, that the execution of the Order must have been required
>       by or permitted in the circumstances which existed at the time
>       it was executed, and that the Order has not been rendered
>       invalid by the operation of any other Rule.
> 
> Since these are private Orders of a type not explicitly defined in the 
> Rules (or, of a type only defined in 1794) this is the only part of the
> Rules that defines the validity or invalidity of the given Orders.  So
> we must determine three things;
> 
> Part II.i: Do the Rules permit Swann to execute an arbitrary private
>            Order?
> 
> The oft-quoted Rule 166;
> 
>      "Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
>       and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
>       which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly
>       or implicitly permits it."
> 
> This is an often abused rule, especially in the case of scams like the 
> present one.  But, in the narrow case of the question we are asking, it
>  is absolutely applicable.  1796 asks, do the Rules permit a Player to 
> issue this Order.  Rule 166 responds, forcefully, "barring any Rules to 
> the contrary, the answer is yes."  Are there any contrary rules?  There 
> are, in fact, none.  There is no Rule that prohibits any player from 
> issuing any private Order e deems appropriate.  (There is, in fact, very 
> little restriction on who can issue orders outside the definitions for 
> the various classes, which renders a strong sounding criteria 
> practically void of any real effect.)
> 
> Part II.ii: Do the Rules "require or permit" the execution of Swann's
>             Orders in the circumstances which existed at the time they 
>             were executed?
> 
> First off, the strong criterion, "require" is mooted by the weaker 
> criterion, "permit."  By Rule 116, if the Rules don't prohibit the Order 
> in the given circumstances, they permit it.  Again, there is no explicit 
> restriction in the Rules upon the execution of an arbitrary private 
> Order.  There are a set of other "circumstances" that could trigger this 
> clause if they existed; They would be the operation of an SLC, *or a 
> prior Order.*  Neither of these apply to Swann in the given situation.  
> However, these "circumstances" now apply to all the Players subject to 
> Swann's Orders.
> 
> Part II.iii: Have Swann's Orders been rendered invalid by the operation 
>              of any other Rule? 
> 
> This provision is mostly redundant, but is an opportunity to emphasize 
> again-- no Rule prohibited the execution of the Orders given by Swann, 
> and given the nature of the Rules governing Orders, and the existence of 
> Rule 116, the lack of such a prohibition is all that is required for 
> these (or any) Orders to have their effect.  In conclusion, it is an 
> obvious conclusion that the Orders given by Swann do indeed fulfill all 
> the criteria for validity as provided by Rule 1796.
> 
> Part III: Are such arbitrary Private Orders effective?  Do the Rules 
>           require the Players so Ordered to obey them?
> 
> >From Rule 1811;
> 
>      "Any entity who, while required by an Order to refrain from
>       performing an action, performs the proscribed action while the
>       Order is in effect commits the Crime of Contempt by Action, a
>       Class C Crime."
> 
> This Rule clinches the idea that to violate these Orders is, in fact, 
> "breaking the Rules."  I believe that there is a strong Game Custom to
