I believe that this order is invalid.  Rule 1793/0 reads in part:

      An Order is a command, executed by a Player and directed to some
      entity requiring that entity to perform exactly one action, or
      to refrain from performing one or more actions.

You have here amended an order to require me to take an action and
to refrain from taking actions.  However an order may only do one or
the other, not both.  Thus I believe this order is by definition not
an Order at all.


I issue the order below, only if it is legal for me to do:

I hereby Order and command Player Swann to refrain from using words
       that are not spelled the same backwards as forwards when
       issuing any Administrative, Judicial, Appellate or Private
       Orders unless the issuing of those Orders is explicitly
       required of 'em by the Rules or by an Order issued by Player
       Macross.


This should effectively hold off the dictator.

-Macross

This and the recent ruling on CFJ 1049 lead to the conclusion that the
Order was indeed issued.

Presented with evidence that there is more than just one person out
there who thinks that the BOS should be lowered, I hereby announce

effect with respect to the salaries due to paid out for Office-holding
this week, and will not affect the salaries still to be paid for last
