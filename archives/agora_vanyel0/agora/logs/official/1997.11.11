Elections are currently being held to fill every Office, and the Nominating
Periods have all now concluded. 

I received no Nominations for the following Offices:

Archivist             
Cartographor          

These Offices continue to be held temporarily (by Vanyel and Morendil,
respectively). A new Nominating Period for these Offices, lasting one
week, is therefore commenced as of this message.

I received single Nominations as below for the following Offices:

Ambassador            Kolja A.
Assessor              General Chaos
Chancellor            General Chaos
Clerk of the Courts   elJefe
Commander-in-Chief    Vlad
Herald                Crito
Notary                Murphy
Registrar             Michael
Rulekeepor            Chuck
Wizard                General Chaos

These Players are therefore Elected by Acclamation to the Offices for
which they were the sole Candidates. They hold these Offices in the
normal fashion as of this message, and their Terms of Service will
expire on 01 March 1998.

I received multiple Nominations as below for the following Offices:

Justiciar             Swann, General Chaos, Crito
Mad Scientist         Swann, Oerjan
Promotor              Crito, Swann
Speaker-Elect         Steve, General Chaos, Michael, Morendil

Voting in these Election commences as of this message, and will last
one week. I remain Vote Collector for these Elections, even though
Michael is Elected Registrar as of this message.

I note that there is some doubt over the legality of Morendil's
nomination for the Office of Speaker-Elect, as he is currently
Speaker.  The precise effects of R1558 are, however, unclear, and I
thought it better to risk making the mistake of wrongly including him
than to risk making the mistake of wrongly leaving him out.
