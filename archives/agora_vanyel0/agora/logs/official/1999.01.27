Text of Proposals in Queue (not a distribution)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

54. Proposal by Andre, AI=1
Amendment Applications

Let a Rule be created, with the Title 'Amendment Applications', and
the following text:

  There exists a type of Application called an Amendment Application. 
  Such an Application is Executed by submitting it to the Promotor.
  For an Amendment Application to be effective:

  * it must state that it is an Amendment Application;

  * it must clearly identify exactly one Proposal to which it applies;

  * the Proposal to which it applies must be in the Proposal Queue

  * it must contain a text, clearly identified as such, that is to be
  the new text of the Proposal;

  * it must contain the signature of the Executor of the Proposer of
  the Proposal

  * it must contain the signature of each Player that increased the
  Priority of the Proposal

  When an Amendment Application takes effect, the text of the Proposal
  is changed to the text specified in the Amendment Application.

Furthermore, let Rule 1036 be changed by changing the phrase
  "This publication shall include the number, title, priority, and
   time of proposal, for each proposal in the Queue."
by
  "This publication shall include the number, Proposer, title, 
   Priority, and time of proposal, as well as any Players other than
   the Proposer who increasted the Priority of the Proposal, for each
   proposal in the Queue."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

66. Proposal by Blob, AI=1
Actions With N Supporters

Create a rule, with title "Actions With N Supporters", and text:

      Certain changes to Nomic Properties may be made With N
      Supporters, where N is an integer between one and five
      inclusive, specifying how many supporters are necessary to
      allow the change to take place. Only those changes explicitly
      allowed by other Rules may be so made, and in order for such
      a change to take effect, the Rule allowing the change must
      explicitly state which Player or Players are authorized to
      make the change. If such a Rule does not specify a value for N
      between one and five, the value of N is one. For brevity's
      sake, the term "With Support" shall be taken as meaning
      "With one Supporter".

      In order to make a change With N Supporters, a Player
      authorized to make a given change With N Supporters must
      first post to the Public Forum eir intent to make such a change,
      unambiguously describing the change to be made. The change then
      takes place when a Player authorized to make that change With
      N Supporters (who need not be the same player who posted eir
      intent to make the change) posts to the Public Forum that that
      change is made, and the following conditions are fulfilled:

      (a) the post announcing the change is made no fewer than four
          days after, nor more than fourteen days after, the post
          announcing the intent to make the change;

      (b) between the two posts, N or more Players posted to the
          Public Forum supporting the change.

      This Rule defers to Rules which place further restrictions
      on the effectiveness of changes made With Supporters.

70. Proposal by Kolja A., AI=1
Fix monthly salaries

Amend R1670 by replacing the string "after the beginning of each Nomic
Week" with "after the beginning of each month". 

Amend rules 1607, 1449, 889, 910, 559, 1051 and 1377 by replacing
"weekly salary" with "salary" in each of them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

75. Proposal by Steve, AI=2
Vlad the Historian

In recognition and appreciation of his masterful research into early
Agoran history, be it hereby resolved that the Agoran community bestow
upon Vlad, aka Scott de Brestian, the Unique Patent Title of Historian.

Be it further resolved that Vlad be awarded the Degree of Doctor of
Nomic History for his Thesis, published in two parts, entitled
'Prolegomena to the Study of Early Agoran History'.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

77. Proposal by Blob, AI=1
Modes of Voting

Amend Rule 1764 (Public Voting) to read:

  (a) There are three possible modes of voting on Proposals, Elections
      and Referenda: Public, Private and Unrestricted. The prevailing
      mode for each of each of Proposals, Elections and Referenda is 
      initially Public.

  (b)  (1) The Assessor may change the prevailing mode of voting
           for Proposals, with Support. 

       (2) The Registrar may change the prevailing mode of
           voting for Elections, with Support. 

       (3) The prevailing mode of Referenda is always Public.

  (c) When the Voting Period on a Proposal, Election or Referendum
      begins, the mode of voting for that Proposal, Election or 
      Referendum is set to the prevailing mode for that kind of vote.
      Once set in this manner, the mode of voting cannot be changed.

  (d)  (1) If the mode of voting is Public, then any other Rule to the 
           contrary notwithstanding, the casting of any votes, or the 
           declaration of Presence, by Voting Entities on that Proposal, 
           Election or Referendum, may only be achieved by sending a 
           message to the Public Forum.

       (2) If the mode of voting is Private, then any other Rule to the 
           contrary notwithstanding, the casting of any votes, or the 
           declaration of Presence, by Voting Entities on that Proposal, 
           Election or Referendum, may only be achieved by sending a 
           message privately to the Vote Collector.

       (3) If the mode of voting is Unrestricted, then any other Rule 
           to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of any votes, 
           or the declaration of Presence, by Voting Entities on that 
           Proposal, Election or Referendum, may be achieved by sending
           a message either publically or privately.

Change the title of Rule 1764 to "Modes of Voting".

[v1.0 - Allows for a little bit of experimentation with different
        voting models without repeated proposals changing from one
        to another. Gives the Assessor and the Registrar some
        relatively innocuous discretionary powers with which to lure 
        the voters.

 v1.1 - Modified it to use the new "With Support" rule. Removed the
        clause describing timing, as that is covered by "With Support"
        (albeit in a different way).

        I am in the process of bringing the numbering in line with
        Gen Chaos' standard, but I've lost the message in which he
        described it. 

        Removed the final clause as it didn't seem to have any real
        purpose.

78. Proposal by Michael, AI=1
(no title)

That Rule 1854 ("The Chancellor can set the Basic Officer Salary") be
amended to read:

The Chancellor can set the Basic Officer Salary by first announcing
that e is doing so in the Public Forum, provided that e announces a
value between 0 VTs and 8 VTs inclusive.  The change to the Basic
Officer Salary then occurs at the beginning of the next week if the
announcement was made on a Thursday or earlier in the week.  If the
announcement is made later in the week, then the change occurs at the
start of the second week after the announcement. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

47. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=2
Restore Sanity

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 206 be amended to read:

      (a) Each Player is entitled to cast at most one Vote upon each
          Proposal.

      (b) A Player may be deprived of the right to cast a Vote upon
          any one Proposal, or upon Proposals generally, by the Rules
          or by an Order issued pursuant to the Rules.

      (c) No entity other than a Player may cast Votes upon Proposals.

      (d) The term "Voting Entity" is hereby declared to be synonymous
          with "Player", except where such construction would clearly
          not make sense.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 683 be amended to read:

      (a) A Player casts a vote upon a Proposal by sending a message
          to the Assessor specifying the Vote e is casting and the
          Proposal upon which it is cast.

      (b) A vote cast under this Rule must be one of FOR, AGAINST, or
          ABSTAIN, or an obvious synonym thereof.

      (c) Any attempt by a Player to cast a vote is void and without
          legal effect if:
        (1) the attempt is made other than during the Voting Period of
            the Proposal in question,
        (2) the Player attempting to cast a Vote is barred from Voting
            upon that Proposal by the Rules or by an Order then in
            effect barring em from doing so,
        (3) the Player attempting to cast a Vote has previously cast a
            vote (other than a vote made void by this subrule) upon
            that Proposal, or
        (4) the attempt violates, or if allowed would violate, this or
            any other Rule.

      (d) Votes, once cast according to this Rule, cannot be
          retracted, cancelled, or changed except when the Rules
          require it, and then only as required by the Rules.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1449 be amended to read:

There shall exist the Office of Assessor.  The Assessor shall receive
a weekly salary equal to the Basic Officer Salary.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1771 be amended to read:

      (a) Not more than once in any Nomic Week, each Player may select
          any one Proposal in the Proposal Queue and may increase or
          decrease the priority of that Proposal by one, by sending a
          message to the Promotor indicating the Proposal to be
          affected and whether that Proposal's priority is to be
          increased or decreased.

      (b) An attempt to change the Priority of a Proposal in the
          Proposal Queue shall be void and without legal effect if:
        (1) the Player who attempted it has already changed the
            priority of any Proposal during the same Nomic Week;
        (2) the attempt relates to a Proposal which is no longer in
            the Proposal Queue; or
        (3) the change attempted would result in the Proposal having a
            priority less than zero.

      (c) The Promotor and the Speaker shall each be permitted to
          exercise the right given by subdivision (a) of this Rule
          twice in each week, instead of once.  However, if the same
          Player is both Promotor and Speaker, e may not exercise this
          right three times.  The remainder of this Rule shall be
          interpreted so as to be consistent with the intent of this
          subrule.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1036 be amended, by replacing the
word "zero" with "one" wherever it appears.

Be it further resolved, that Rules 1442, 1765, 1715, 1824, 1660, 1760,
1723, 1724, 1772 and 1862 be repealed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

48. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Every Man is an Island

Be it therefore resolved, that Rules 766, 716, 719, 721, 1752, 718,
1446, 1539, 1528, 1614, 1612, 1531, 1547, 1759, 1533, 1397, 1617, 1458
and 717 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 206 be amended, by replacing
"Players and Groups are Voting Entities" with "Players are Voting
Entities".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1637 be amended, by deleting the
paragraph which begins "A Will belonging to an Organization".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1727 be amended, by deleting the
paragraph which contains the phrase "the Notary may select".

Be it further resolved, that Rules 1601, 1637, 1738 and 1757 be
amended, by replacing the word "Notary" with the word "Chancellor"
wherever it may appear.

[While there may be some utility in allowing bodies corporate, the
current Rules woefully fail to accomplish this in any useful sense.
Furthermore, most contests can be adequately carried forth under the
Law of Contracts (Rule 1742) without requiring the overhead of
statutory support.  SLCs should probably also go, but I'll cross that
bridge when I find it.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

49. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=2
Unlimited Voting

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 206 be amended to read:

      (a) A Voting Entity is an Entity which is generally authorized
          by the Rules to cast a vote or votes on a Proposal.  Other
          Rules may withdraw this authorization from a Voting Entity
          in specific circumstances without that Entity thereby
          ceasing to be a Voting Entity.  Only those Entities
          designated by the Rules to be Voting Entities are Voting
          Entities.

      (b) No Entity is permitted to vote on a Proposal unless it is a
          Voting Entity.

      (c) Players and Groups are Voting Entities.

      (d) Unless otherwise specified, each Voting Entity may cast an
          unlimited number of Votes on a Proposal.

Be it further resolved, that Rules 1660 and 1765 be repealed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

50. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Oh, what a tangled web...

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 478 be amended to read:

      (a) A Public Forum is any medium of communication so designated
          as such by the Registrar.

      (b) The Registrar may designate any medium as a Public Forum, or
          revoke such designation from a medium already so designated,
          Without Objection.  However, The message which is to
          effectuate the change intended must be sent via a medium
          which is a Public Forum both before and after the
          designation or revocation, in order to have legal effect.

      (c) Every Active Player shall ensure that e is able to receive
          messages sent to every medium which the Registrar has
          designated as a Public Forum.  However, the temporary
          inability of a Player to receive a Public Forum does not
          deprive that medium of its status as a Public Forum.

      (d) Any message conveyed by one or more Public Fora is deemed to
          have been sent to the Public Forum.

      (e) Subdivision (d) of this Rule notwithstanding, any message
          sent, by any medium or combination of media, to every Active
          Player so that each Active Player is reasonably certain to
          receive it, is deemed to have been sent to the Public Forum,
          but only if it bears a clear indication that it is intended
          to be a Public Forum message.

      (f) Whenever the Rules require a Player to "announce", "post",
          or "distribute" some communication or notification, that
          Player shall do so by sending it to the Public Forum, unless
          the Rules specify otherwise in that instance.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

51. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Some Housecleaning

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 408 be amended to read:

      (a) The Judge of an open CFJ is required to, within seven days
          of when that CFJ last became open or seven days of eir
          assignment to that CFJ, whichever is later, close that CFJ
          by dismissing or judging the CFJ and/or granting or denying
          any outstanding judicial motions pertaining to that CFJ.

      (b) The failure of a Judge to close a case within the prescribed
          time constitutes the Infraction of Judicial Tardiness and
          carries a penalty of one Blot for each day (or fraction
          thereof) that the case remains open beyond the permitted
          time.  This penalty is to be reported by the Clerk of the
          Courts.

      (c) The failure to observe this time limit does not, by itself,
          cause the delinquent Judge to be recused from the CFJ, nor
          does it invalidate eir judgment or dismissal of the CFJ or
          grant or denial of any related judicial motion which that
          Judge might submit after the limit has expired.

      (d) This Rule defers to any other Rule which prescribes a
          different time limit in which a CFJ must be closed, and to
          any other Rule which establishes procedures by which the
          time limit specified in this Rule may be extended or
          shortened.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

52. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Down with Playerism

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 833 be amended to read:

      As soon as possible after the beginning of the Nomic Week, the
      Assessor shall pay out two Proposal Notes to each entity who
      submitted an Interested Proposal which was adopted during the
      previous Week.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

55. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Make the Proposal Queue More Competitive

Be it therefore resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) The Proposal Tariff is a number of P-Notes (which must be a
          multiple of the MUQ for P-Notes), greater than 0 and not
          more than 2.

      (b) The value of the Proposal Tariff, upon the adoption of the
          Proposal which created this Rule, is 1.

      (c) The Promotor may change the value of the Proposal Tariff by
          announcing its new value in the Public Forum, provided that
          the new value is within the range allowed by subdivision (a)
          of this Rule.

      (d) Whenever a new value is announced according to subdivision
          (c) of this Rule, the new value takes effect at the
          beginning of the next Nomic Week, unless the announcement is
          made within three days of the end of the current Nomic Week,
          in which case the new value takes effect at the beginning of
          the Nomic Week following the next Nomic Week.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1771 be amended to read:

      A Player may increase or decrease the Priority of a Proposal in
      the Queue by announcing to the Public Forum that e does so, and
      paying a number of P-Notes to the Bank. For each multiple of the
      Proposal Tariff e pays to the Bank, the Priority of the Proposal
      is increased or decreased by one, as specified by the Player
      making the payment, provided that this transfer is not executed
      for any other purpose.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1701 be amended, by replacing "is 1"
with "is 0.01".

Auctions

Create a rule, with title "Default Procedure for Auctions", and text:

      When an Auction is required and the procedure is not defined
      elsewhere, the following standard Auction procedure shall be
      used. Details specified herein are defaults which may be
      modified by other Rules for specific situations.

      Auctioneer: The Auctioneer is the Entity responsible for
      collecting bids and announcing the result of the Auction.
      This Entity is the Speaker if not otherwise specified.

      Bidders: Every Player not on Hold may Bid in an Auction.
      On Hold status is measured at the time a Player sends eir
      Bid.

      Auction Currency: Each Auction is conducted in one particular
      currency. Unless otherwise specified, the Auction Currency is
      the Voting Token.

      Start of Auction: The Auction begins at the time the
      first correct and legal announcement that an Auction is
      begun, as defined in other Rules, is sent to the Public
      Forum, together with the identity of the Auctioneer, the
      Auction Currency, and the value of the Starting Bid.

      Starting Bid: The Starting Bid is the minimum possible
      value of a bid. If not otherwise specified, the Stating Bid
      is equal to the MUQ of the Auction Currency.

      Making Bids: Each Bidder may make as many Bids as e desires
      during the Auction. A Bid is a message, sent to the Public
      Forum, announcing that the sender is bidding in that
      particular Auction, and the amount of eir Bid. A Bid is only
      valid if it satisfies the following conditions:

          (1) The Bid is not made before the start of the
              Auction, or after its end.
          (2) The amount Bid is a multiple of the MUQ of the
              Auction Currency.
          (3) The amount Bid is no less than the Starting Bid.
          (4) The Bid is larger than any other valid Bid made
              so far in the Auction.

      End of Auction: If, one week after the Auction started,
      there have been no Bids made. The Auction ends, and has no
      winner. Otherwise the Auction ends when 24 hours has passed
      without a valid Bid having been made.

      The Winner: When the Auction ends, the Bidder who made the
      largest valid Bid in the Auction is the Winner. The
      Auctioneer shall announce the Winner of the Auction as soon
      as possible after the end of the Auction, and shall issue
      a Payment Order from the Winner to the Bank, for an amount
      equal to the size of the winning Bid.

Create a rule, with title "Private Auctions", and text:

      If an Auction is designated by the rules as being Private,
      then Bids may only made by sending them privately to the
      Auctioneer. This rule takes precedence over the standard
      Auction procedure.

76. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Let the Promotor Exercise Judgment

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1483 be amended to read:

      (a) A Proposal is any document clearly marked as such.

      (b) A Proposal is Proposed when it is posted by a Proposing
          Entity to the Public Forum with the clear indication that it
          is being posted for the purpose of Proposing it.

      (c) A Proposal is not Proposed if, in the Promotor's judgment,
          it is substantially identical to another Proposal Proposed
          within the past three weeks, unless
        (1) the Proposing Entity posting the Proposal clearly
            indicates at the time of posting that the Proposal is
            intended to become a duplicate of the prior Proposal, or
        (2) the prior Proposal has been discarded or withdrawn, or has
            been distributed and the results of voting upon that
            Proposal have been announced by the Assessor.

      (d) The Promotor's determination that a Proposal has or has not
          been Proposed (including a determination made under
          subdivision (c) of this Rule) is subject to judicial review
          only for abuse of discretion.

      (e) Under no circumstance shall the Promotor's distribution of
          previously undistributed Proposals constitute the submission
          of a new Proposal.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Any CFJ which alleges that an Officer made an error
          regarding a determination of fact where the Rules state that
          such determinations shall be subject to judicial review only
          for abuse of discretion lacks standing and shall be
          dismissed.  (Such CFJs, to have standing, must allege that
          the Officer in question abused discretion in making the
          disputed determination.)

      (b) This Rule takes precedence over all other Rules pertaining
          to when a CFJ has standing, and over all other Rules which
          specify when a CFJ shall be dismissed.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

79. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Standards of Proof

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1575 be amended to read:

      (a) A CFJ alleging that a Player has violated a Rule or
          committed a Crime shall not be judged TRUE unless the
          evidence is sufficient to be certain of that Judgement
          beyond reasonable doubt.

      (b) In all other CFJs, the Judgement shall be consistent with
          the preponderance of the evidence at hand.

      (c) Furthermore, it is a complete defense to any accusation of a
          Crime that the Player accused, at the time e performed or
          neglected to perform the actions which constitute the Crime
          accused, reasonably believed that the circumstances were
          such that e was legally permitted to perform or neglect to
          perform those acts.  No Player shall be convicted of a Crime
          if this defense applies.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

80. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Currencies

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1721 be amended to read:

      There shall exist the Office of Chancellor.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1467 be amended to read:

      (a) A Currency is any medium of exchange which has been
          designated as a Currency in accordance with the Rules.

      (b) The designation of a medium of exchange as a Currency, and
          the cancellation of such designation, may be accomplished
          only by:
        (1) the operation of an Instrument with Power 1 or greater;
        (2) the Chancellor, Without Objection; or
        (3) Judicial Order, whenever the Rules so permit.

      (c) For the purposes of the Rules, units of a Currency are
          fungible and indivisible.

      (d) A Currency may be denominated such that a fraction of its
          primary denomination is its smallest indivisible unit, so
          long as there is a smallest indivisible unit.  When no other
          specification exists, the smallest indivisible unit of a
          Currency shall be one unit of its smallest denomination. 
          Amounts less than this smallest indivisible unit may be used
          in intermediate calculations; all such calculations shall be
          rounded off at the point that they are reduced to transfers,
          orders to transfer, or other finalized results of legal
          import.

      (e) The Chancellor shall retain and publish at least monthly a
          schedule, listing every medium of exchange designated as a
          Currency under this Rule.  This schedule shall include
          whatever information the Chancellor deems necessary, but at
          least the following information for each Currency:
        (1) the designated denomination or denominations of that
            Currency (and if more than one, the relationship between
            them);
        (2) the fraction of the smallest denomination of that Currency
            which is its smallest indivisible unit;
        (3) that Currency's Recordkeepor; and,
        (4) the Mintor or Mintors of that Currency, if any.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) The "Recordkeeper" of a Currency refers to the entity who
          has agreed to maintain a record of the ownership of the
          units of that Currency.  The Recordkeepor of an Currency is
          subject to the jurisdiction of these Rules.  Specifically, e
          shall:
        (1) maintain the abovementioned records in a manner consistent
            with these Rules, including the timely recordation of
            transfers of ownership made consistent with the Rules;
        (2) comply in a timely manner to all requests to produce those
            records as required by the Rules; and
        (3) perform all other duties which the Rules impose upon the
            Recordkeepor of a Currency.

      (b) A Currency may have any number of designated Mintors.  A
          Mintor may be designated for a Currency, or such designated
          cancelled, by:
        (1) the operation of an Instrument with Power 1 or greater; or
        (2) the Chancellor, Without Objection.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1598 be amended to read:

      Units of a Currency are transferred only when the Recordkeepor
      of that Currency receives a notice from the owner of one or more
      units of that Currency, specifying the units to be transferred
      and the entity who is to owner the units thus transferred.  The
      entity receiving the units thus transferred becomes their owner,
      and the Recordkeepor shall so note this on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1471 be amended to read:

      Units of a Currency are created only when the Recordkeepor of
      that Currency receives a notice from a designated Mintor of that
      Currency, specifying the number of units to be created and the
      entity who is to own the units so created.  The specified entity
      owns the units so created, and the Recordkeepor shall so note
      this on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      Units of a Currency are destroyed only when the Recordkeepor of
      that Currency receives a notice from the owner of one or more
      units of that Currency, specifying the units to be destroyed. 
      The Recordkeepor shall note this destruction on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1596 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever an entity becomes indebted to another for some
          amount of Currency, that entity indebted is required to
          transfer that amount of Currency to the entity indebted to
          within seven days.

      (b) A debt not paid within seven days is overdue.  Any entity to
          whom an overdue debt is due may assess a late penalty of not
          more than 25% of the overdue debt, and may do so repeatedly,
          not more than once every seven days after the debt becomes
          overdue.  Late penalties are added to the overdue debt.  An
          entity may elect to charge smaller late penalties, charge
          them less frequently, or forego late penalties altogether,
          at that entity's sole discretion.

      (c) If the validity of a debt, or any part thereof, is disputed
          by a Call for Judgement, that debt (or portion thereof) is
          not considered overdue, and does not accrue late penalties,
          while the dispute remains unsettled.

      (d) When an entity transfers units of Currency to another entity
          for the purpose of making a payment on debt, the receiving
          entity shall apply that payment to the nondisputed debts
          owed to em by the transferring entity, in order from oldest
          to newest.  A debt is paid when a transfer has been applied
          to it in this manner.  Any surplus may be returned to the
          transferring entity, or may be retained by the receiving
          entity to be applied to future debts.  Any amount retained
          by a receiving entity in this manner shall be returned upon
          demand.

      (e) An entity may assume that any Currencies transferred to it
          to be payments on debts due to em, unless the transferree
          clearly indicates otherwise when making the transfer.

      (f) An entity who is owed an overdue debt may issue an Order
          requiring the entity who owes that debt to make payment by
          requiring a transfer of any amount up to the amount of the
          debt due, but only if no other Order currently in force
          requires the same entity to make payment on that same debt
          or any part thereof.  Such an Order shall be stayed (by the
          Clerk of the Courts) if the debt in question is subsequently
          disputed, and vacated (by the Judge) if it is found that the
          debt upon which the Order is based is invalid.

      (g) An entity who is owed a debt may cancel all or part of that
          debt at any time.

      (h) A Judge may enjoin the assessment of late penalties,
          restrict the amount of late penalties, or require the
          reduction or cancellation of a debt, by Judicial Order, when
          the Rules specifically so allow.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1479 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever a Rule calls for an Officer to pay out some
          quantity of Currency to some entity, that Officer shall
          execute a Notice of Debt for the given amount with that
          entity as payee and the Bank as payor.

      (b) Whenever a Rule calls for an Officer to bill an entity for
          some quantity of Currency, that Officer shall execute a
          Notice of Debt for the given amount with that entity as
          payor and the Bank as payee.

      (c) A Notice of Debt is executed by announcing in the Public
          Forum that the payor is indebted to the payee for the amount
          indicated, so long as the announcement sets for the reason
          therefore.

      (d) The lawful execution of a Notice of Debt causes the payor
          noted therein to be indebted to the payee noted therein for
          the amount noted therein, but only if the executor of the
          Notice of Debt was authorized to execute it, and the reason
          set forth therein is correct.

      (e) The duties required of Officers by this Rule shall be
          performed as soon as possible after they arise.

      (f) For the purposes of this Rule, the Speaker shall be
          considered an Officer.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1817 be amended to read:

      (a) The Recordkeepor of a Currency is required to record every
          transfer for which e receives a transfer notice denominated
          in the Currency of which e is the recordkeepor, when:
        (1) the notice was sent by the transferring entity's Executor,
            or, for an entity which lacks an Executor, by any other
            person empowered by the Rules to execute transfers on the
            behalf of the transferring entity;
        (2) the notice clearly sets forth the quantity to be
            transferred in a form such that the Recordkeepor can
            easily and definitively determine the amount being
            transferred;
        (3) the entity to receive the transfer is specified with
            sufficient clarity that a reasonable person in the
            Recordkeepor's position would know to which entity the
            transferring entity refers; and
        (4) the transfer is for an amount not more than the current
            holdings of the transferring entity.

      (b) Transfers shall be noted on the Recordkeepor's records in
          the order in which they are received by the Recordkeepor.

      (c) When a Recordkeepor records a transfer, e shall promptly
          inform the recipient of the transfer that the transfer has
          been recorded, unless it appears to the Recordkeepor that
          the recipient is already aware of the transfer.

      (d) When a Recordkeepor elects not to record a transfer for the
          reason that the transfer is not in conformance with any part
          of subdivision (a) of this Rule, e shall promptly inform
          both the transferrer and the recipient that the transfer has
          not be recorded, and give the reason therefor.  (If the
          reason for failure to record is that the recipient was not
          clearly specified, there is no duty to inform the
          recipient.)

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1696 be amended to read:

      (a) Voting Tokens are hereby designated as a Currency.  The sole
          designated Mintor of Voting Tokens is the Bank.  The
          Recordkeepor of Voting Tokens is irrevocably designated to
          be the Accountor.  The smallest indivisible unit for this
          Currency is 0.01 Voting Token.

      (b) The Accountor constructively agrees to act as Recordkeepor
          for Voting Tokens by accepting the Office.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1701 be amended to read:

      (a) Proposal Notes are hereby designated as a Currency.  The
          sole designated Mintor of Proposal Notes is the Bank.  The
          Recordkeepor of Proposal Notes is irrevocably designated to
          be the Promotor.

      (b) The Promotor constructively agrees to act as Recordkeepor
          for Proposal Notes by accepting the Office.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1435 be amended to read:

      (a) Indulgences are hereby designated as a Currency.  The sole
          designated Mintor of Indulgences is the Bank.  The
          Recordkeepor of Indulgences is irrevocably designated to be
          the Herald.

      (b) The Herald constructively agrees to act as Recordkeepor for
          Indulgences by accepting the Office.

      (c) An entity which owes a debt (or debts) to the Bank for any
          number of Indulgences is said to have that number of Blots.
          A Player has Blots equal to the sum of all such debts. Debts
          which are in dispute are still considered when determining
          how many Blots a Player has.

      (d) When a Rule states that a Player is to gain some number of
          Blots, a Notice of Debt shall be executed for the same
          number of Indulgences, naming that Player as the payor and
          the Bank as payee; this order shall be executed by whomever
          the Rules require to report the change in Blots.

      (e) A Player who has no debt in Indulgences to the Bank is
          Immaculate.

      (f) It is a Win-Preventing condition for a Player to have one or
          more Blots.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1601 be amended to read:

      (a) An entity is dissolute if it:
        (1) possesses any number of units of Currency, and
        (2) does not have an Executor.

      (b) The Notary may perform any of the following with respect to
          a dissolute entity:
        (1) transfer Currencies owned by that entity to any entity to
            which the dissolute entity owes debts, for the purpose of
            making partial or complete payment on those debts;
        (2) cancel in part or in full any debts owed to it; or
        (3) Without Objection, transfer Currencies owned by that
            entity to the Bank.

      (c) The Notary is authorized, all other Rules notwithstanding,
          to transfer Currency from any dissolute entity to any other
          entity as if e were the dissolute entity's Executor, when e
          is permitted to do so in accordance with subdivision (b) of
          this Rule.

      (d) A dissolute entity is considered to continue to have legal
          existence as long as it continues to possess units of
          Currency, even if it is dissolved, destroyed, or otherwise
          would cease to have legal existence prior to that time.  An
          entity which has legal existence solely as a result of this
          subdivision is called "terminal".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1853 be amended to read:

      (a) Taxes may be levied only when the Rules explicitly permit
          it, and then only by the Officer authorized by the Rule
          permitting the levy.

      (b) An Officer levies a tax by announcing it in a Public Forum.
          An announcement of levy must specify:
        (1) The Currency being taxed;
        (2) the amount of the levy, expressed as a percentage; and
        (3) the legal authorization for the levy.

      (c) Upon the announcement of a tax levy conforming with
          subdivision (b) of this Rule, each entity other than the
          Bank becomes liable to the Bank for a debt equal to the
          stated percentage of that entity's holdings of the Currency
          stated in the announcement.  The amount of each entity's tax
          debt shall be based on the amount of that Currency owned by
          that entity at the time the announcement was made.

      (d) The Recordkeepor of the Currency named in a tax levy shall,
          as soon as possible after the announcement, provide a report
          setting out the amount of the taxed Currency held by every
          entity which held any units of that Currency at the time the
          announcement was made.  The Recordkeepor is not required to
          compute the tax due; if e does so, eir computations do not
          have any legal force.

      (e) The amount of tax levied may not exceed 50% of an entity's
          holdings unless the Rule which authorizes the tax explicitly
          permits it.

          except for the purpose of making payment upon the debts of
          the Bank, or when otherwise explictly required by the Rules
          to do so.

      (d) If the Chancellor makes a transfer not permitted by
          subdivision (c) of this Rule, e commits the Class A Crime of
          Misappropriation, and upon conviction of this Crime shall be
          removed from Office.

Player." with "All debts in Indulgences owed to the Bank by any
Rebellious Player are cancelled."; by deleting the paragraph which

deleting the paragraph which begins "The Registrar is authorised to
vacate".

      who executed it.  Certain classes of Orders may be amended,
      stayed, or vacated in other circumstances as well, when the
      Rules so allow.  In all cases, this is done by an Order to

      otherwise changed once executed.

          question is recognized as a Currency after all provisions of
          the Proposal which enacted this Rule have been implemented
          to the extent permitted by law.

      (b) Each entity which was named as the payor of a Payment Order
          executed and neither satisfied nor vacated at the time the
          Proposal which created this Rule was adopted shall owe a

Thanks. I could not find the Rules which said this, and so did not know
whether it should go to the PF or just to the Recordkeeper. Now I know, I
can safely re-issue them:


In my position as Chancellor I hereby issue a Transfer Order for 1 VT from 
the Bank to Steve to satisfy Payment Order VT603.

Acting as Chancellor, I hereby issue a Transfer Order of 2 P-Notes from the
Bank to Oerjan, to satisfy Payment Order apn026.

Due to (apparent) public demand, I hereby submit this Call for 
Judgement.

The following statement is to be judged.

"The message I sent to the discussion forum, declaring my presence on 
the recent Proposals 3825 and 3826, is valid."

For the following reasons


Firstly the Vote Collector of these Proposals received my declaration 
through the discussion forum.  Thus satisfying rule 1715.  However rule 
1764 states that,

"Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
any votes, or the declaration of Presence, by Voting Entities
on Proposals, Elections or Referenda, may only be achieved by
sending a message to the Public Forum." 

And by this rule 1764 would take precedence over rule 1715.  Only for 
reasons of if the vote was valid by who it was received by.  However I 
believe that rule 1764 by the virtue of allowing or disallowing votes, 
changes whether or not a proposal has met Quorum.

Now rule 1715 also states that,

"This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which determine
Quorum or whether a Proposal, Election or Referendum has met
Quorum."

And so by this rule 1717 takes precedence over rule 1764, causing a 
contradiction.

Now considering Rule 1030

      If two or more Rules with the same Power conflict with one
      another, then the Rule with the lower Number takes precedence.

      If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of Rule) or
      takes precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supercede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.

      If all of the Rules in conflict explicitly say that their
      precedence relations are determined by some other Rule for
      determining precedence relations, then the determinations of
      the precedence determining Rule shall supercede the numerical
      method for determining precedence.

      If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

In this case I believe the last paragraph comes into force, and so rule 
1715 takes precedence over rule 1764 for all contradictions between the 
two rules.  In particular a declaration of presence is valid if sent to 
the collector of votes for a given proposal, and so does not necessarily 
have to be sent to a public forum.

Secondly,  if for whatever reason the argument  above does not hold, 
making declaration valid only if sent to a public forum.  I believe that 
my message did satisfy being sent to a public forum.  For the following 
reasons

Rule 478 states

      Sending a message, by any medium or combination of media, to
      every Active Player, is equivalent to sending it to the Public
      Forum, provided that the message bears a clear indication that
      it is intended to be a message to the Public Forum, and it is
      verifiable that the message was in fact sent to every Active
      Player.

I believe that my declaration was sent to every active player, and also 
that this is verifiable.  Also as (for the reasons of the above argument 
failing) such a message has to be sent to a public forum to be valid.  
This would give a clear indication that it was indeed intended for a 
public forum.  

Further evidence also suggests that people though the message was 
intended for a public forum.  People not realizing themselves that it 
had been sent to public forum told me that the message should be posted 
to a public forum.   Surely they would not tell me to send the message 
to a public forum, if it was not clear to them that it was intended to 
be sent to a public forum.

Also note that nearly all declarations such as the one I sent arrive at 
a public forum (sooner or later).  This would also suggest that my 
message was intended for a public forum.


If any parts of my arguments are unclear then I will gladly try to give 
you more information, and explanations that might make them clearer.

Peekee
