COE admitted. All these Payment Orders are hereby vacated.

I thought this Rule did not hold for Appeal Judgements because of the
wording of Rule 1447, but reading back I see that Rule 502 covers this
case as well, and takes precedence.

Furthermore, I hereby issue the following Payment Orders (all but the last
two are re-issues of the Payment Orders vacated above):

History:

  Assigned to Vir, as of this message

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Rule 663 permits an Injunction to apply more than one Player.
Therefore it is consistent to read the message in the relevant
Judgement as issuing 4 Injunctions. That the statement of the
Injunctions themselves refers to 'Injunctions' rather than 'an
Injunction' may be considered irrelevant under 754; further, Rule
663 requires that *each* Injunction should specify the Player or
Players to which it applies; thus, this reading is rendered necessary 
as well as legal by Rule 663; for multiple Injunctions to exist, 
mutliple specifications should exist, whereas "all current Officers" 
is merely one specification.

I bar Andre, Steve and elJefe. (The reason for doing so is that as
Justices in the relevant Board of Appeals, each Player named seems
to have already formed a conclusion as to this issue, which
conclusion was not part of what that Board was to consider - it seems
prudent, therefore, to leave a final decision in the hands of Players
who cannot be considered biased.)

========================================

Rule 663/6 (Power=1)
Injunctions--General

      A Judge is permitted to issue orders requiring one or more
      Players to perform, or refrain from performing, one or more
      actions.  Such an order is called an Injunction.

       To be legally made, an Injunction must:

        i) Specify the Player(s) to whom it applies.
       ii) Specify the action(s) the Player(s) are required to perform
           or refrain from performing.
      iii) Either be attached to a legally made Judgement at the time
           that Judgement is originally delivered to the Cotc, or be
           legally made by the Board of Appeals in an Appeal of an
           Injunction.
       iv) Be of a type explicitly defined in the Rules.
        v) Be issued in a manner consistent with the Rules.

      An Injunction which does not meet these criteria has no effect.

========================================

Judge's Decision & Reasoning in 1045:

In CFJ 1045, I find the Statement to be TRUE.

I am in essential agreement with the Caller that Rule 1563 provides
more than adequate justification for Dismissing the named CFJs, in
spite of some arduous wording which made it briefly tempting - given
the rewards of returning a Judgement on, rather than Dismiss, these
CFJs - to wriggle my way out of it.


But wait, there is more.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the sum total of Payment
Orders in Indulgences naming that Player as Payor that they have thus
far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the sum total of Payment
Orders in Voting Tokens naming that Player as Payor that they have
thus far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Proposal Notes equal to the sum total of
Payment Orders in Indulgences naming that Player as Payor that they
have thus far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to the Registrar, requiring em to issue, for each Player, a
Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, that Player as Payee, for an
amount of 5 VTs. (So we can Vote on Proposals, y'know...)

The above facially satisfy provisions i) through iv) of Rule 663
pertaining to Injunctions; it is my belief that they also satisfy v),
though that requires us to examine any Rule relevant thereto. I find
one, Rule 1736 itself, which states

      The Rules may require, in certain cases, that a Judge issue an
      Injunction ordering the execution of a Payment Order.  If the
      Payment Order required by such an Injunction is executed, and
      the Injunction itself later set aside, the Player who executed
      the required Payment Order shall, as soon as possible after the
      Injunction was set aside, vacate that Payment Order.

This merely states that Rules are permitted to require Judges to
issue Injuctions under certain circumstances; it is as far as I can
see no bar to a Judge taking it upon emself to issue any legal
Injuction. No prohibition of any kind in fact obtains with respect to
issuing Injuctions defined in 1736/1737; the procedure for issuing an
Injunction is well delineated, and followed to a T in this Judgement;
issuing an Injunctions in the present circumstances is therefore
possible and unprohibited, which I submit is all that 'in a manner
consistent with the Rules' requires.

Lastly, a note as to intent - obviously, this loophole can be used for
massive personal gain (well, once the status of Currencies has been
determined), and just as obviously it will be extremely tempting for
other Players assigned to Judge CFJs to take advantage of it for the
same reasons. It could also be used to summarily deregister anyone
from the Game by assigning them 31 Blots.

There is no limit to how far this could be abused; if everyone jumps
on that bandwagon, all we will do is spoil the game absolutely. Better
we should fix that loophole, and quick, and refrain from doing
anything else about it for the sake of preserving the game's fun.

I think the above is even-handed enough that Players (especially
Justices or Judges with CFJs currently assigned to em) will see their
own interest in letting it stand at that.

(And remember, you ain't seen nothing yet.)

======================================================================

Original Judgement: TRUE

Reasons and arguments:

Judge elJefe's reasoning on CFJ 929 applies here as well.

======================================================================

Appeals decisions

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Justice elJefe's decision: SUSTAIN

                              CFJ 930

"No Payment Orders have thus far been successfully executed, for the
 reason that none exist."

Judge Chuck relied on the reasoning of CFJ 929:

However, at the time of the CFJ, only one Transfer Order could have
been submitted, namely the Chancellor's transfer of 9 Indulgences
from the Bank to Elde. At that time the Mint (which was Mintor of
Indulgences) no longer had Mint Authority due to the effects of
Proposal 3533. Thus Indulgences ceased to exist as a Currency by
Rule 1579, and so the Chancellor's posting, not referring to any
Currency, was not a Transfer Order.

The only point in dispute is whether Indulgences continued to exist as
a currency after the adoption of Proposal 3533.  If they did then the
reasoning in the quoted paragraph of CFJ 929 is correct and the
judgement of TRUE stands.  If not then the judgement in both CFJs
should be FALSE, since the Misanthropists' currencies failed to
confuse itself with Payment Orders or Transfer Orders defined in the
Rules.

Quoting from Rule 1579: "If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist,
or ceases to have the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that
Currency are destroyed, and that Currency ceases to exist."  There is
unchallenged evidence that the old Mintor for Indulgences ceased to
exist, and that no new Mintor was designated.  Therefore unless this
conflicts with some higher-power Rule, it must be applied.

Rule 1435 begins "Indulgences are a Currency."  One possible
interpretation is that Indulgences were destroyed and ceased to exist
at a given instant; but then immediately after that R1435
re-established Indulgences as a Currency without a Mintor, which then
is immune to R1579 since it has no Mintor which can either cease
existing or lose Mint authority. (*)

This has several things wrong with it.  Rule 1435 is silent as to
whether Indulgences have a Mintor or not, so there is no conflict on
this point with R1579.  Thus any "re-establishment" of the currency
must follow the first sentence of R1579, which insists that each
Currency has a Mintor.

Further, the whole notion does not give sufficient respect to the
natural meaning of "cease to exist".  A rule mandating that something
ceases to exist does not mean for the thing to have its existence
interrupted temporarily and then re-appear.  If R1579 is strong enough
to destroy Indulgences (or P-notes) as a currency, then it is strong
enough to keep them destroyed.

This brings us to the central question: _is_ R1579 strong enough to do
what it says?  Well, does it conflict with R1435?  No.  R1435 simply
says that Indulgences are a Currency; R1579 says that they are in fact
a destroyed Currency. (**) This is similar to the repeal of a Rule;
longstanding Game Custom holds that a Rule or Proposal which repeals
another Rule is not for that sole reason in conflict with it. (***)
Thus 1579 did cause Indulgences to cease to exist, and they still
cease to exist to the present time.

NOTES:

(*) This possibility was raised during the discussion of the issues
surrounding a similar situation with regards to P-notes, so it is as
well to dispose of it here.

(**) My fellow learned Justice Michael objected that an earlier
version involves a "secret" insertion of "defunct" into the rule.
This wording is what I meant.

(***) My fellow learned Justice Michael also objected here, pointing
out that Rules and Rule changes occupy separate worlds.  But I feel
this misses the point of my analogy: a Rule Change (proposed or
unproposed) is effective only by virtue of Rules that allow it to take
effect.  Do those Rules (which affect the content of the Ruleset)
actually _conflict_ with the Rule being repealed?

This would be like having an implicit clause in each Rule that stated
"This rule may not be repealed"; game custom says it does not.
Similarly, Rule 1479 does not contain an implied "this currency may
not be destroyed" as part of its defining sentence.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Justice Michael's decision: OVERTURN/reverse

If Indulgences exist, then a Payment Order was executed by the
Chancellor when he attempted to transfer 9 Indulgences from the Bank
to Elde.

If Indulgences exist, then the Indulgence Currency's Recordkeepor is
authorised to record and execute Payment Orders (R1596).

Thus, if Indulgences exist, the correct judgement for this CFJ is
FALSE.

The argument that Indulgences do not exist is based on R1579, which
states that all Currencies have a Mintor and if a Currency should lose
its Mintor, then it is destroyed.  It is accepted that an entity known
as the Mint was the Mintor for Indulgences before the Pragmatic
Currencies reform occurred.

By virtue of R1586, we must also accept that the Mint no longer
exists, so it would appear that the antecedent of the conditional
sentence of the second paragraph in R1597 holds.  So, what might
prevent Indulgences from being destroyed, as required by R1579?

The answer is the precedence taking R1435.  This states that
"Indulgences are a Currency".  This statement must remain true,
whatever R1579 says to the contrary.  My Fellow Justice elJefe claims
that this is possible if one reads "Indulgences are a Currency" as
"Indulgences are a destroyed Currency".

This is a senseless contortion.  We do not need to put the rules
through such hoops.  We have rules taking precedence over each other
all the time.  When we read "Indulgences are a Currency", we know that
this is equivalent to stating that there exists a Currency whose name
is "Indulgences".  But now the opposing argument wants us to
simultaneously read this as admitting the precise opposite, that this
Currency doesn't exist at all.

I refuse to make the Rules play such tricks.  If a high precedence
rule says that Indulgences exist, then the lower precedence R1579 can
yammer on about Mintors and the lack thereof all it likes.

Indulgences exist.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Justice Steve's Decision: OVERTURN/reverse

In the Appeal of the CFJ 930, I hereby reverse the original Judgement
and find the Statement FALSE.

The other Justices, eljefe and Michael, have already done most of
the groundwork for this Judgement. They correctly identify the
existence of Indulgences as a Currency after the passage of P3533
as the pivotal point on which the truth of the Statement turns. If
Indulgences continued to exist after the adoption of P3533, then
the Statement is FALSE. If they did not, then the Statement is TRUE.

Justice Eljefe thinks that R1579, which calls for Indulgences to
cease to exist, and R1435, which states that Indulgences exist, can
be read so as not conflict with one another, by reading R1435 as
claiming that Indulgences exist, but as a destroyed Currency. I,
however, join Justice Michael in rejecting this interpretation as
contorted. I agree with Michael that R1579 conflicted with R1435
when it sought to bring the existence of Indulgences as a Currency
to an end. Since R1435 wins this precedence conflict, R1579 could
not be successful in ending the existence of Indulgences as a
Currency. Therefore, the Statement is FALSE.

A note about CFJ 929, to which this CFJ was a companion, and to which
Judge Chuck appealed in making his Judgement of this CFJ: it is worth
remarking that R1435 did not prevent R1579 from destroying all the
individual instances of Indulgences in circulation at the time P3533
took effect. It is therefore entirely possible that Chancellor G.
Chaos' Indulgence transfer to Elde could not be successfully executed
for that reason. It would depend on whether the Chancellor had minted
any more Indulgences before executing the Transfer Order. However,
both CFJs 929 and 930 claim not merely that no Transfer Orders and no
Payment Orders had been successfully executed, but additionally that
this was so specifically for the reason that no such Orders existed -
and this issue is independent of whether the Orders (specifically, the
Transfer Order) might not have been successfully executed by reason
of lack of funds in the Bank to cover them.

Speaker and pro-Speaker (!) Steve

=====================================================================

Final Judgement: FALSE

The Appelate Court has already rendered a majority opinion on this
issue, and it would be foolhardy of me to stand opposed to that
opinion.

Therefore:  A Judgement of FALSE is hereby entered.  

It is so ordered.

	"Either Blob's Executor is emself, or Blob has no Executor."

======================================================================

Judge:       Harlequin

Judgement:   TRUE

Eligible:    Andre, Blob, Calabresi, ChrisM, Chuck, Crito,
	     elJefe, General Chaos, Harlequin, Michael, 
             Morendil, Oerjan, Steve, Vir, Vlad, Zefram

History:
  Called by Murphy, 08 Oct 1997 23:23:37 -0700
  Assigned to Harlequin, 10 Oct 1997 20:51:31 +0200 (MET DST)
  Harlequin judges TRUE, 12 Oct 1997 12:07:32 -0700

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Morendil becomes Elde's EiP.
Rule 1738 says that Elde's EiP is eir Executor, so Morendil is Elde's
  Executor and succeeds in reregistering Elde.
Elde becomes Blob's EiP.
By a similar argument, Elde is Blob's Executor and succeeds in reregistering
  Blob.
Elde is deregistered.
No Rule states that a Player who is deregistered loses eir Executor or EiP,
  so Morendil is still Elde's Executor and EiP.
Rule 1478's statement that Executors must be Players takes precedence over
  Rule 1738's claim that Blob's EiP (Elde) is eir Executor, so Elde is no
  longer Blob's Executor.
However, no Rule states that an EiP who is deregistered ceases to be EiP,
  so Elde is still Blob's EiP.

When Elde ceased to be Blob's Executor, e did not cease to be Blob's EiP -
precisely because the equality of EiP and Executor (which exists only
because Rule 1738 says so) is broken by way of Rule 1478 starting to take
precedence over Rule 1738.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

I hereby judge this CFJ to be TRUE.

There are only two possibilities as to who could be Blob's executor:
Blob and Elde. Elde cannot be eir Executor, since Elde is not a
Player. No other Player could be Blob's executor, since no action
has been taken which would make another Player Blob's Executor. 
Since the first part of the statement ("...Blob's Executor is
emself..." is true, then the CFJ is also true.

======================================================================

Proposal 3555 (Steve)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
A Public Voting Experiment

[Comment: third time lucky, maybe?]

WHEREAS voting in Agora's long history has traditionally been by
secret ballot, and whereas it is well known to psephologists that
subtle changes in the mechanics of voting can have interesting
effects, we, the Voting Entities of Agora, do hereby resolve to conduct
the following Public Voting Experiment for the duration of a trial two-
month period, and to that end further resolve that a Rule, entitled
"A Public Voting Experiment", be created with the following text:

      Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
      any votes by Voting Entities on Proposals, Elections or Referenda,
      may only be achieved by sending a message to the Public Forum.

      This Rule shall repeal itself 60 days after it is created.

======================================================================

Proposal 3556 (Steve)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Disinterested Amendments can be Attributed

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 1623 be amended by deleting from it
the text:

      All Rule Changes in a Disinterested Proposal are Unattributed.

======================================================================

Proposal 3557 (Steve)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
A Win by Bribery for Steve

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled, "A Win by Bribery for Steve"
be created with the following text:

      The creation of this Rule is a Win condition for Steve.

      Furthermore, as soon as possible after the creation of this
      Rule, the Assessor shall pay out 3 Voting Tokens and 2
      Indulgences to each Player who declared eir Presence and did
      not vote either FOR or AGAINST the Proposal whose adoption
      resulted in the creation of this Rule.
  
      This Rule repeals itself when the Assessor has executed the
      Payment Orders specified above.

Be it further resolved that Rule 1561 be amended to read:

      Any Proposal which offers a bribe to a Player or Players to
      vote either FOR or AGAINST, or to declare Presence, on a
      Proposal (either itself or another Proposal) shall be
      completely without effect, even if it is adopted, any Rule to
      the contrary notwithstanding.

======================================================================
Proposal 3558 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Contract Law

Be it therefore resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      If two (or more) Players enter into an agreement, but one (or
      more) of these Players then fails to comply with that agreement,
      any other Player party to that agreement may make a CFJ alleging
      that that agreement has been broken.

      If the Judge of such a CFJ finds that the agreement has in fact
      been broken, e is permitted to issue Injunctions binding upon
      any or all of the parties of the broken agreement so as to
      effect fair and appropriate restitution for its breach.  When
      restitution would involve the transfer of Currencies, the Judge
      is authorized to execute whatever Payment Orders are necessary to
      effect fair and appropriate restitution.

      The above notwithstanding, no restitution shall be available
      with respect to the breach of the agreement which would have
      required a Player to break the Rules, nor shall restitution
      include the execution of Payment Orders, the payor of which is
      any entity not party to the agreement.

      Nothing in this Rule shall be construed so as to impair the
      enforcement of an agreement which requires a Player to violate
      another agreement.
      
      A CFJ alleging that an agreement has been broken called by
      anyone who is not party to that agreement lacks standing and
      shall be dismissed. 

======================================================================
Proposal 3559 (Murphy)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Clarify Judge Eligibility

Amend Rule 911 by replacing this text:

       iv) E was ineligible to Judge the CFJ that resulted in the
           matter under consideration, and this restriction does not
           prevent three eligible Players from being selected by the
           CotC for the Board.

with this text:

       iv) E was not eligible to Judge the CFJ that resulted in the
           matter under consideration when it was called, and this
           restriction does not prevent three eligible Players from
           being selected by the CotC for the Board.

======================================================================
Proposal 3560 (Murphy)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Clarify Movement

Amend Rule 1707 by replacing "where it Moves to" with "which Location
it Moves to".

======================================================================
Proposal 3561 (Oerjan)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Exorcise Probate

Amend Rule 1738 by replacing the text

      The Executor in Probate of an entity is the Executor of that
      entity, and empowered only to submit Transfers Orders for that
      entity.  An Executor in Probate also has the power to execute
      and vacate certain Payment Orders, as specified by the Probate
      Code.  This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which
      would specify a different Executor for an entity in Probate.

with

      The Executor in Probate of an entity is not its Executor, but
      is empowered to submit for that entity any Transfers Orders
      required by the Probate Code, with the same effect as if e
      were its Executor.  This Rule takes precedence over any other
      Rule which would prohibit Transfer Orders, if submitted in
      accordance with the Probate Code, from being effective.

      An Executor in Probate also has the power to execute and
      vacate certain Payment Orders, as specified by the Probate
      Code.

Amend Rule 1713 (Debt) by replacing both instances of "Executor" with
"Executor if any".

[#2: By Kolja A's request, clarified that entities in Probate do not
commit Persistent Indebtedness.]

======================================================================
Proposal 3562 (Oerjan)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Patent Title for Andre

Andre is awarded the Patent Title of .

======================================================================
Proposal 3563 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1565 be amended, to replace "3
Mil" with "1 VT".

======================================================================
Proposal 3564 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Fix Acclamation Timing

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1445 be amended, by appending the
following Paragraph:

      * Effective Time of Election Results: The results of an Election
      are effective at the time the results of the Referendum are
      announced; or, if there is no Referendum, at the time that the
      Vote Collector announces that there is to be no Referendum.

======================================================================
Proposal 3565 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Revise Applications

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1626 be amended to read:      

      An Application is any body of text designated as such by a
      Player.  This Player is known as its Sponsor.  

      A Player's Signature is added to an Application when e sends a
      message to that Application's Sponsor indicating that e wishes
      to sign it.  

      A Player's Signature is stricken from the Application when e
      sends a message to the Sponsor of the Application stating that e
      wishes eir signature stricken.  Further, the Sponsor of an
      Application may strike any Signature from the Application at any
      time.

      If an Application is amended in any way (except to add or strike
      a Signature), any and all Signatures which appear on it are
      stricken from it.

      An Application is Executed when its Sponsor submits it to
      whatever Officer or other Player is designated by the Rules to
      receive Applications of that particular type, with whatever
      effect is defined by the Rules for the Execution of that type of
      Application.  However, any other Rule notwithstanding, the
      Execution of an Application shall have no effect unless Executed
      within 14 days of the time the oldest Signature which appears on
      it was added.  

      If a Player Executes an Application which contains Signatures
      added to it in a manner inconsistent with this Rule, e commits
      the Crime of Application Fraud, a Class D Crime.

Be it further resolved, that Rules 1627, 1628, and 1629 be repealed.

[The present Rules for Applications require the destruction of
Applications in certain situations, and have other odd
conceptualizations that are at odds with common sense.]

======================================================================
Proposal 3566 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1465 be amended, by replacing the
string "the Assessor shall pay out" with "the Registrar shall pay
out".

[It makes more sense for the Registrar to pay out Champion's Rewards,
since it is the Registrar that keeps track of who has received a
Champion's Reward.]

======================================================================
Proposal 3567 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Liberalize Speaker's Patronage

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1661 be amended, by replacing "for
an amount not in excess of 1 VT" with "for not more than 1 unit of any
one Currency Minted by the Bank."

[This allows the Speaker to give awards of, say, one Indulgence or one
P-Note, in addition to giving up to 1 VTs.  Or at least will once we
fix P-Notes and Indulgences.]

======================================================================
Proposal 3568 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested, Emergency)
PI Amnesty

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1713 be amended, by appending the
following paragraph:

      With the exception of this paragraph, this Rule shall have no
      effect prior to the first day of December, 1997.

    I hereby transfer one Kudo from Morendil, for utterly losing perspective
    about the nature of the game, to Steve, in compsensation for Morendil's
    treatment of him.

Date: Tue, 14 Oct 1997 10:42:10 +0000

    elJefe correctly alleges that Morendil is Lawless.  Morendil is
    deregistered.

Date: Tue, 14 Oct 1997 08:22:43 -0700 (PDT)

    Antimatter, acting for emself, transfer one Kudo FROM Harlequin TO Blob
    and then deregisters.

    I transfer one Kudo FROM Harlequin, for being annoying in changing my
    address, TO Blob, for being Zombified.

The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of
a VOC directive was the report published in the PF on 1996/08/13
(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

AFAIK, no Herald's Report has ever been successfully ratified.
