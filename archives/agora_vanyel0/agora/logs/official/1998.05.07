======================================================================
Proposal 3741 (Murphy) AI = 1
Plots

[Part One:  Replace Locations with Plots]

Rename Rule 1706 ("Locations") to "Plots" and amend it to read:

      There is a class of entities called Plots.  All Plots are initially owned
      by the Bank.

      Each Plot has a unique name.  A Plot's owner may change its name Without
      Objection.

      Plots are not Locations; no Location shall become a Plot due to the
      adoption of the Proposal which enacted this Rule.  One second after this
      Rule is created, it shall amend itself by removing this paragraph.

Create a new Rule entitled "Buying and Selling Plots" with this text:

      The Market Value of a Plot is 5 VTs, unless the Rules state
      otherwise.  In particular, the Market Value of the first three
      Bank-owned Plots purchased by a given Player is 0 VTs.

      A Player may become the owner of a Bank-owned Plot by transferring the
      Market Value of that Plot to the Bank for the sole purpose of buying
      that Plot.

      A Plot's owner may transfer ownership of it to any other consenting
      entity, by informing the Cartographor that e wishes to do so.  For the
      purposes of this Rule, the Bank is always deemed to consent to such
      wishes.  Furthermore, as soon as possible after a Plot is transferred to
      the Bank in this way, the Cartographor shall pay out half the Plot's
      Market Value to the transferring entity.

Repeal Rule 1707 ("Movement").

Amend Rule 1708 ("Adjacency") to read:

      Each Plot has a Longitude and Latitude, each of which is an integer.  Two
      Plots are Adjacent if and only if one of the following applies:

        * They have the same Longitude, and their Latitudes differ by one.
        * They have the same Latitude, and their Longitudes differ by one.

Repeal Rule 1709 ("Distance").

[Rule 1710 ("The Cartographor") will be amended later.]


For each combination of Latitude (X) from 0 to 9 and Longitude (Y) from 0 to 9,
a Plot named "Area XY" (substituting the Latitude for "X" and the Longitude for
"Y") is created.


Create a Rule entitled "Winning by Ownership" with this text:

      If at least one-third of all Plots are not owned by the Bank, and all
      Plots not owned by the Bank are owned by a single entity, then that
      entity's Executor satisfies a Win Condition known as a Win by Monopoly.

      Upon the correct report of such a Win, all Plots become Owned by the
      Bank.


[Part Two:  Define Structures and Ergs]

Create a Rule entitled "Structures" with this text:

      There exists a class of entities known as Structures.  Each Structure is
      assigned to a Plot and owned by that Plot's owner.  No entity may
      own more than five Structures, unless another Rule specifies otherwise.

Create a Rule entitled "Ergs" with this text:

      Ergs are a Currency.  Their MUQ is 1.  Their Recordkeepor is the
      Cartographor.  Their Mintor is the Bank.

Amend Rule 1677 ("Currency Awards for New Players") to read:

      As soon as possible after the start of a Player's Grace Period, the
      Registrar shall pay out 5 Voting Tokens, 1 P-Note, and 30 Ergs to that
      Player.

Amend Rule 1701 ("Proposal Notes") by removing this paragraph:

      Whenever there exists a Player who has never before possessed
      any P-Notes, the Promotor shall pay out 5 P-Notes to that Player.

Create a Rule with this text:

      Upon the creation of this Rule:
        * All Voting Tokens and P-Notes are destroyed.
        * All obligations to transfer Currency due to Rule 1754
            ("Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank") are cancelled.
        * For each Player, 5 VTs, 1 P-Note, and 30 Ergs are created in
            that Player's possession.

      One second after this Rule is created, it repeals itself.


[Part Three:  Make Structures useful]

Create a Rule entitled "Types of Structures" with this text:

      All Structures have a Type.  Only Types of Structure defined by
      the Rules exist.

      A Player may create a Structure by informing the Cartographor.  E
      must specify the Structure's Type, and to which Plot the Structure
      is assigned.  As soon as possible after this happens, the Cartographor
      shall bill that Player the price of that Type of Structure.

      A Player may destroy a Structure by informing the Cartographor.  E
      must specify to which Plot the Structure is assigned.  As soon as
      possible after this happens, the Cartographor shall pay out to that
      Player half the price of that Type of Structure.

Create a rule titled "Maintenance of Structures" with this text:

      A Player's Maintenance Fee equals the total of the Maintenance Fees of
      all the Structures e owns, plus 1 Erg per Type of Structure e owns, at
      the end of the Nomic Week.

      As soon as possible after the end of the Nomic Week, the Cartographor
      shall bill each Player's Maintenance Fee to that Player.

Create a rule titled "Production of Structures" reading:

      As soon as possible after the end of the Nomic Week, the Cartographor
      shall pay out each Structure's Production to its owner, excluding
      Structures whose Type changed during that Week, and excluding Players
      with a Maintenance Fee that is neither satisfied, disputed, nor vacated.

Create a Rule entitled "Standard Types of Structures" with this text:

      The following Types of Structure exist, with the specified prices,
      Productions, and Maintenance Fees, unless otherwise specified:

        Type       Price      Production     Maintenance Fee
        ----------------------------------------------------
        Farm       4 Ergs     1 VT           1 Erg
        House      4 Ergs     1 P-Note       1 Erg
        Mine       4 Ergs     3 Ergs         1 Erg
        Church     4 Ergs     special        1 Erg

      Churches have no Production.  However, when an Indulgence is to be
      given to a random Player, each Church is deemed to be two Players,
      and any Indulgence that would otherwise be given to a Church is
      instead given to its owner.  This Rule takes precedence over any
      Rule attempting to prevent Churches from having this effect.


[Part Four:  Amend the Rule defining the Cartographor and eir duties]

Amend Rule 1710 ("The Cartographor") to read:

      There is an Office of Cartographor. The Cartographor recieves a
      salary equal to 2 times the Basic Officer Salary.

      At least once each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall post a
      Report to the Public Forum containing the following information:

        * the name, ownership, and Adjacency of all Plots
        * the ownership, assignment (if any) and Type of all Structures
        * the ownership of all Ergs
        * all changes in ownership of Plots since the last Report
        * all changes in ownership, assignment, or Type of all Structures since
            the last Report
        * all Transfer Orders and Payment Orders specifying Ergs since the last
            Report


[Part Five:  Clean up other references to Locations]

Amend Rule 869 ("Registered Players") by removing the following paragraph:

      When a Player registers, eir Location is the Welcoming Center.

Amend Rule 1016 ("Putting Oneself On Hold") by replacing "Moves to the Stasis
Chamber" with "says so in the Public Forum", and by replacing "Moves from the
Stasis Chamber" with "says so in the Public Forum".

Amend Rule 1664 ("Rebellion") by removing the text "whose Location is the Beer
Hall".

Amend Rule 1367 ("Degrees") by adding this paragraph:

      "Granting a Degree" and "awarding a Degree" are synonymous.  A Player who
      has been awarded a Degree possesses that Degree.

Repeal Rule 1711 ("Accepting Degrees").

Repeal Rule 1788 ("VT unemployment benefits").

======================================================================
Proposal 3742 (Harlequin) AI = 1
Electees

Rename Rule 1555 ("Retirement and Removal From Offices") to "Electees and
Removal From Offices," and amend it to read:

      Any Player who holds an Office by virtue of having won an
      Election for that Office is called the Electee to that
      Office.

      When an Electee to an Office is retired from that Office,
      e ceases to be the Electee for that Office. When an Electee 
      to an Office is removed from that Office, e ceases to be
      Electee to that Office, and if e currently holds the Office,
      the Speaker shall become the holder of that Office, unless 
      another Rule specifies a different Player who is to become 
      the temporary of that Office. 

{Comment:

Changed this paragraph to deal with situations where an Electee is removed
or retired from an Office which e does not currently hold.
}

      When a non-Electee Player is removed from an Office, that
      Office shall become held normally by the Electee of that
      Office, if there is an Electee. Otherwise, the Office shall
      be held temporarily by the Speaker.

      If a Player goes On Hold, deregisters, or is deregistered, 
      e shall be removed from all Offices e holds.

Amend Rule 790 ("Filling Vacant Offices") to read:

      Whenever there is an Office with no current Electee, for
      which an Election is not currently being conducted, the
      Registrar shall initiate an Election for that Office,
      as described elsewhere, unless the Office is that of
      Registrar; in that case, the Speaker shall conduct the
      Election. 

Amend Rule 1486 ("Procedure to Impeach an Officer") to read:

      Any Active Player is permitted to call a Referendum to  
      Impeach an Officer at any time, by requesting such in 
      the Public Forum. The Officer is Impeached when such a
      Referendum is passed.

      The Referendum must list both the Office and the current
      Electee to that Office by name. If upon passage of the
      Referendum the named Player is the current Electee of
      that Office, then the Player is immediately removed
      from Office.

      For this Referendum the default procedure for referenda is
      modified as follows: Vote Collector is the Player who called for
      the Impeachment Referendum. Voting Entities do not include the
      Officer under consideration for Impeachment. Adoption Ratio must
      be greater than or equal to 2 for the Referendum to pass.

Amend Rule 1644 ("Dereliction of Duty") by replacing the text:

      (i)   holds an Office in the normal fashion whose duties include
            the weekly production of an Official Report, and

with the text:

      (i)   is the Electee to an Office which e currently holds, and 
            whose duties include the weekly production of an Official 
            Report, and

Amend Rule 1664 ("Rebellion") by replacing the text:

      - All Players that hold one or more Offices are retired from all
        such Offices.

with the text:

      - All Players who are currently Electees to one or more Offices
        cease to be Electees to those Offices.
        
Amend Rule 1645 ("Temporary Delegation of Offices") to read:

      An Electee to an Office who currently holds that Office is 
      permitted to appoint another Player to perform the duties of that 
      Office, for a Period not exceeding two weeks. This is called 
      Delegation; the Player doing the appointing is herein referred to 
      as the Delegating Player and the Player so appointed is herein 
      referred to as the Delegated Player.

      An Office is legally Delegated if and only if the following
      conditions are met:

      (i)   the Delegating Player has posted to the Public Forum a
            Notice of Delegation, naming the Office being Delegated
            and the Delegated Player;

      (ii)  the Delegated Player is permitted by the Rules to hold
            the Office at the commencement of the Period of
            Delegation;

      (iii) the Delegated Player has posted, within the week
            immediately preceding or immediately following the
            posting of the Notice of Delegation, and to the Public
            Forum, a Notice of Consent to Delegation for that Office;

      (iv)  the Delegating Player is still the Electee to the
            Office, and still holds the office at the commencement
            of the Period of Delegation;

      (v)   the Period of Delegation has commenced and not yet
            concluded.

      The Period of Delegation commences at the time the Notice of
      Delegation is posted, or at the time the Notice of Consent to
      Delegation is posted, or at the time (if any) specified by the
      Delegating Player, whichever is latest. The Period of Delegation
      concludes two weeks after the Period of Delegation commences, or
      at the end of the Term of Service for the Delegated Office, or
      at the time (if any) specified by the Delegating Player,
      whichever is earliest.

      During the Period of Delegation, the Delegating Player ceases
      to hold the Delegated Office; the Delegated Player holds the
      Office temporarily, and earns the Salary for that Office as
      described in other Rules. At the end of the Period of 
      Delegation, the Delegated Player ceases to hold the Delegated
      Office, and the Delegating Player resumes holding the Office,
      if e is permitted to do so. If not, the Speaker holds the
      Office.

Amend Rule 880 ("Resignation of Offices") to read:

      A Player may, at any time, resign from any Office which e
      currently holds. 

      An Electee to an Office who resigns from that Office may
      appoint a successor at the time e resigns. In this case,
      the resigning Player is retired from that Office; if the 
      named successor agrees in the Public Forum to be successor 
      to the Office, the named successor becomes holder of the 
      Office.

      A non-Electee who resigns an Office, or an Electee who
      does not name a successor, is immediately removed from
      Office.

{Comment:

Changed this Rule to fix mistake with 'retire'/'resign' terminology.
}

Amend Rule 1758 ("Holding an Office In Perpetuity") by replacing the text:

      If a certain Office is held in the normal fashion by a Player,

with the text:

      If a Player is the Electee to an Office which e currently holds,

Amend Rule 1659 ("The Right to Call Elections") by replacing the text:

                 This Right is exercised by posting an announcement
      in the Public Forum that both lists a number of Offices
      currently held in normal fashion, and declares that the Speaker
      is exercising eir Right to call these Elections.  

with the text:

      in the Public Forum that both lists a number of Offices
      currently held by their Electees, and declares that the Speaker
      is exercising eir Right to call these Elections.  

and the text:

      all such Offices listed in this post are then held temporarily.

to the text:

      the Electees of these Offices shall cease to be the Electees to 
      those Offices.

Amend Rule 1450 ("Speaker Cannot Stay CotC or Justiciar") to read:

      If at any time the Speaker shall be the Electee to either
      the Office of CotC or the Office of Justiciar, e shall be
      retired from whichever of those Offices e is Electee to.

Amend Rule 910 ("The Justiciar") by replacing the text:

      If the Player holding the Office of Justiciar becomes either
      Speaker or Clerk of the Courts, e is immediately retired from
      the Office of Justiciar.

with the text:

      If the Justiciar ever becomes Clerk of the Courts, e is removed
      from the Office of Justiciar.

Amend Rule 1652 ("When the Speaker is Tainted") by replacing the text:

      only until the Office of Speaker-Elect is held by an
      Electee who is not the Speaker.

Proposal 3744 (Blob) AI = 1
P-Note supply

Amend Rule 833 ("Awards & Penalties for Proposals") by replacing the text:

      As soon as possible after the beginning of the Nomic Week,
      the Assessor shall pay out two Voting Tokens to each Player
      who submitted an Interested Proposal which was adopted during
      the previous Week.

with:

      As soon as possible after the beginning of the Nomic Week,
      the Assessor shall pay out two Proposal Notes to each Player
      who submitted an Interested Proposal which was adopted during
      the previous Week.

[Comment: As Steve pointed out, we lack a regular supply of P-Notes.
This relates supply to spending, but with a bit of complexity. You can
turn a profit by making lots of Proposals with Priority 1, but you have to
make sure they get distributed, and that they pass, which is not easy.]
