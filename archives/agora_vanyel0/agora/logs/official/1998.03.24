  **Dice rolls: Gen. Chaos, Morendil

  Appeal of Judgement:
    by Morendil, 19 Mar 1998 10:49:50 +0100
    by Crito, 19 Mar 1998 13:36:29 -0500
    by Antimatter, 23 Mar 1998 20:33:05 +0000
    Assigned to Steve, elJefe, and Jester, as of this message


======================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

The last sentence of rule 1766 states that 'This provision shall not
increase the maximum number of votes that are permitted to be cast by
that Player.' The previous sentence states '... then that Player may
cast two additional votes on that Proposal beyond what e is otherwise
entitled to cast.' I argue that the first sentence would, in fact,
raise the maximum number of votes above what it would otherwise be
(two), and thus the second sentence renders that null.

Rule 206 says that 'Each Voting Entity has two votes on a proposal,
unless another Rule says otherwise.' This clearly establishes a
maximum number of legal votes. The second sentence of that paragraph
says 'However, no such Entity shall have more than five votes on any
Proposal, regardless of what any other Rule may say to the contrary.'
This establishes a second maximum on the number of votes which may
legally cast, such that the maximum equates to 'two, plus any granted
by other rules, or five, whichever is lower'.


======================================================================
Evidence supplied by Caller:

Rule 206/10 (Power=2)
Voting Entities and Votes

      A Voting Entity is an Entity which is generally authorized by
      the Rules to cast a vote or votes on a Proposal, although other
      Rules may withdraw this authorization from a Voting Entity in
      specific circumstances without that Entity thereby ceasing to be
      a Voting Entity. No Entity is permitted to vote on a Proposal
      unless it is a Voting Entity, and only those Entities designated
      by the Rules to be Voting Entities are Voting Entities. Players
      and Groups are Voting Entities.

      Each Voting Entity has two votes on a Proposal, unless another
      Rule says otherwise. However, no such Entity shall have more
      than five votes on any Proposal, regardless of what any other
      Rule may say to the contrary.

Rule 1766/0 (Power=1)
The Officer's Vote

      If a particular Proposal amends the duties or description of a
      particular Office, and a Player holds that Office in normal
      fashion, and that Player is not the same Player who Proposed the
      Proposal, then that Player may cast two additional votes on that
      Proposal beyond what e is otherwise entitled to cast.  This
      shall not increase the maximum number of votes that are
      permitted to be cast by that Player.


======================================================================
Judge's Argument:

I'm still not satisfied with my own reasoning on this, nor with
the arguments that have been offered, pro or con. I therefore return
a decision of FALSE, on the grounds that Rule 1660 does succeed in
granting additional Votes, despite being afflicted with essentially
the same wording as 1766; however, I also call for the Appeal of my
own Judgement, thereby kicking it up to the higher Court. I will
present a fuller version of my analysis of 206, 1766 and 1660 in that
capacity, hopefully made more cogent by conferring with my fellow
Justices.
