The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of
a VOC directive was the report published in the PF on 1996/08/13
(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

AFAIK, no Herald's Report has ever been successfully ratified.

Proposal  (Swann) AI = 1
Ratification and Reporting Tweaks

NOTE: What this does is attempt to smooth out a lot of nasty confusions 
in the Ratification process.  Because of a number of authors over the 
past couple of years, some ambiguity and a few outright contradictions 
crept in.  I've fixed the following; The Official Report/Officer's 
Report/Official Document confusion.  There are now Officer's Reports, 
which are Official Documents, and Official Documents, which are defined 
broadly by 1552.  I've also rewritten the rules to allow mechanisms 
other than proposals to Ratify Documents, permitting Ratification w/o 
Objection to actually work.


Rule 1686 is amended to read as follows;

      For each Office, the Rules may designate a set of information to
      be the corresponding Officer's Report.  All such Reports are
      Official Documents.  The only information that is part of an
      Officer's Report is that which the Rules specifically state is
      part of that Officer's Report.

      The holder of an Office for which there is an Officer's Report
      shall maintain all information in the Report, and shall post it
      to the Public Forum at least once every Nomic Week.  Failure to
      post the Officer's Report is the Infraction of Failure to Report,
      the penalty for which is the same as the penalty for a Class D
      Crime.  The Registrar and the Speaker are authorized to detect
      and report commissions of this Infraction.


Let the following Rule be Created;
(Title: Initiation and Execution of Ratification)

     Whenever an Official Document is Ratified, there is a time at which 
     the Ratification is Initiated, and a time the Ratification is 
     Executed.

     In the case of Ratification Without Objection, the Ratification is 
     Initiated when the appropriate Officer posts the intent to Ratify 
     in the Public Forum, and the Ratification is Executed when the 
     appropriate Officer makes a valid (as defined in other Rules) post 
     that the Ratification has been made.

     In the case of a Ratification by Proposal, the Ratification is 
     Initiated when the Proposal to Ratify is submitted to the Promotor, 
     and it is Executed when that Proposal is passed.

     If other Rules define alternative methods of Ratifying Official 
     Documents, they must define when Ratifications via those methods 
     are Initiated and Executed, otherwise those methods cannot be used 
     to Ratify any Official Documents.  This Rule takes precedence over 
     any Rule that contradicts its provisions.

     When a Ratification is Executed, the Execution is successful 
     and the Document is Ratified, if, and only if, the Official 
     Document it specifies is still one that is legally valid for 
     Ratification upon such Execution.


Rule 1552 is amended to read as follows;

      In order for an Official Document to be valid for the purpose of
      a Ratification, it must satisfy all the following criteria at
      the time Ratification is Initiated:

           i) The Rules require some specific Player to produce and/or
              maintain the document.
          ii) The Rules required it to be published in the Public
              Forum.  (A requirement that it be sent to all Players
              fulfills this criteria.)
         iii) It is not currently subject to a Claim of Error. (COE)
          iv) It is not currently subject to a pending Call for
              Judgement (CFJ), or a pending Appeal of a CFJ.
           v) The information within the Document has not been
              superseded by a subsequent Document.
          vi) The Document is not the Ruleset. The Ruleset is
              specifically excluded from Ratification.

      Further, a Document can become invalid before Ratification is
      Executed if any of the following occurs before that time:

           i) The Document is superseded by a subsequent Document
              which contradicts the information in the prior Document.
              This does not apply if there is a COE alleging the
              contradiction is an error, and the error is admitted
              before the end of the Proposal's Voting Period.
          ii) A COE is made on the Document, and the COE has not been
              denied before the end of the Proposal's Voting
              Period.
         iii) The Document becomes subject to a pending CFJ or a
              pending appeal of a CFJ.

       If, before a Ratification of a Document is Executed, another
       Document is issued that does not contradict the prior Document, 
       it does not alter the validity of the prior Document.


Rule 1550 is amended to read as follows;

     Ratification of an Official Document shall only be Executed if the 
     Ratification was Initiated via procedures explicitly defined in the 
     Rules and the Ratification explicitly specified a valid Official 
     Document it Ratifies.

     It shall always be permissible to Ratify any valid Official 
     Document by the operation of an adopted Proposal.

     This Rule takes precedence over any rule that would allow a 
     Ratification to be executed in contradiction of its requirements.


Rule 1551 is amended to read as follows;

      Sucessful Execution of a Ratification of an Official Document
      conforms the Game State to what it would be if the valid Official 
      Document thus ratified was completely true and accurate at the 
      time of the Document's publication in the Public Forum.  In other 
      words, the State of the Game, upon such Execution, becomes that
      specified within the Document, plus all subsequent legal changes 
      between the time of its publication and its Ratification was 
      Executed.

      All Game State changes due to the ratification of an Official
      Document occur at the time of such Execution; no retroactive
      effect is expressed or implied.

      A Document, once ratified, is for all legal purposes a true and
      accurate report.  The Game State it references may not be
      retroactively modified prior to the time it was published in the
      Public Forum, even to reflect a prior mistake, retracted or
      illegal move, or an Order.  This Rule takes precedence over
      any Rule that would allow such retroactive alterations or
      corrections to the Game State.

      In no way does the ratification of a Document invalidate,
      reverse, alter or cancel any prior moves or transfers, even
      unrecorded or overlooked ones.  Nor does the ratification of a
      Document change the legality or illegality of any prior move.
      Ratification only adjusts the actual Game State to conform to
      that perceived by the Players and Officers in Official
      Documentation.

      After Ratification of a Document is sucessfully Executed, the
      Player in charge of maintaining that Document shall annotate all 
      subsequent publications of that Document with the date of 
      publication of the last such publication that was ratified..

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Swann) AI = 1
Allow Dynamic and/or Conditional AI's

Rule 594 is amended by changing the words,
     "requested by its Proposer (if any)"
to read,
     "specified in the Proposal (if any)"

{Comment: A minor change, but allows a proposal to be conditional--ie. 
          "The AI of this Proposal is 3 if the Voting Index it achieves 
          is greater than three, and 1 otherwise."}

Use it or lose it.

Create a Rule, entitled "Use it or Lose it", with text:

      If, at the end of the month, a Player who has been Active
      for that whole month has not voted on any Proposals 
      distributed that month, then the Assessor shall deny voting
      Privileges to that Player, for two weeks.

Amend Rule 879/6 (Power=1)
Quorum

      Quorum for a Proposal is achieved if a vote is cast on that
      Proposal by one-third of Active Players not denied voting 
      privileges, or one-fifth of all Players, whichever is greater.

      Quorum for a Proposal is calculated using the number of
      Registered Players, and their Hold statuses (On or Off), at the
      beginning of the prescribed Voting Period for that Proposal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Blob) AI = 1
A collection of small fixes.

[Comment: I have collected together a number of recent proto's I
 have made, into a single proposal, in the hope that people will
 think it is worth spending VTs on.]

Amend Rule 1837 ("The Miscreant") to read:

      Let there exist the Patent Title of "Miscreant".

      If any Player has more than ten Blots, the Player with the most
      Blots earns the Title of Miscreant.  If no Player has the most
      number of Blots, there is no Miscreant.  The Miscreant loses
      eir Title of Miscreant if eir number of Blots drops below ten,
      if another Player gains as many Blots as em, or if another
      Player gains more Blots than em.

      The Herald shall announce in the Public Forum whenever a Player
      receives or loses this Title, as soon as possible after such
      award or revocation occurs.

      A Player with the Title Miscreant counts as two Rebellious 
      Players when determining the outcome of a Revolt. This rule
      takes precedence over any other rule determining the outcome
      of a Revolt.

[Comment: Add a reporting requirement, as per the Samurai, and also
 a precedence clause, so that the last paragraph actually works.]

Amend Rule 879 ("Quorum") to read:

      Quorum for a Proposal is achieved if a vote is cast on that
      Proposal by one-third of Active Players not denied voting 
      privileges, or one-fifth of all Players, whichever is greater.

      Quorum for a Proposal is calculated at the beginning of the 
      prescribed Voting Period for that Proposal, using information
      current at that time.

[Comment: If there are a lot of people who can't vote, it makes
 achieving Quorum rather difficult. This eases the burden.]

Amend Rule 1632 ("InterNomic Voting Procedure") by replacing the text:

      The InterNomic Vote shall be FOR if the Referendum on that
      Proposal has passed and AGAINST if the Referendum on that
      Proposal has failed. If the Referendum on that Proposal is
      undecided, then Agora shall abstain from voting on that
      Proposal.

with:

      The InterNomic Vote shall be FOR if the Referendum on that
      Proposal has passed and AGAINST if the Referendum on that
      Proposal has failed. If the Referendum on that Proposal is
      undecided, then the Ambassador may decide how Agora votes,
      as e sees fit.

[Comment: Not exactly a fix, but a toned down version of my previous
 attempt to empower the Ambasssador. Now e only has power to choose
 when the voting public are too apathetic to tell him how to vote.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Blob) AI = 1
Skimming a bit off the top.

Amend rule 1449 ("The Assessor") to read:

      There shall exist the Office of Assessor.  The Assessor
      shall receive a weekly salary equal to 0.5 times the Basic
      Officer Salary.

      The Assessor shall also receive a Commission. At the end
      of the Voting Period for a Proposal, the Assessor shall
      pay out to emself an amount equal to 5% of the VTs spent
      on voting on that Proposal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Blob) AI = 1
The Voting Tariff

Crete a rule, entitled "The Voting Tariff", with text:

      The Voting Tariff is a number of VTs, a multiple of the
      MUQ, between 0.5 and 2.0 inclusive. Unless the Rules give
      it another value, the Voting Tariff is 1 VT.

      The Assessor may change the value of the Voting Tariff by
      announcing the new value in the Public Forum, provided that
      e announces a value within the range proscribed above, that
      e makes the announcement prior to midnight GMT Thursday, and 
      that e has not already made such an announcement earlier in 
      the Week. The new value of the Voting Tariff does not take
      effect until the beginning of the Nomic Week after the
      change has been announced.

Amend rule Rule 1442 ("The Cost of Voting") to read:

      Proposals have a voting cost, equal to the Voting Tariff
      at the time they were distributed. If there was no value
      set for the Voting Tariff at that time, then the voting
      cost is 1 VT.

      As soon as possible after the end of the Voting Period of a
      given Proposal, the Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity a
      number of Voting Tokens equal to the votes cast on that
      Proposal by that entity multiplied by the voting cost for
      that Proposal.

[Comment: Yet another parameter for the economy. Gives us a way 
 to handle voting slumps, like the present one, by making voting
 cheaper. But Votes are still valuable, because of the danger that
 prices will go up.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Steve) AI = 1
Extend the Secret Voting Experiment

[Comment: The secret voting experiment seems to be working reasonably
well. I'd like to extend it another two months. Note that this quite
independent of the issue of Presence.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rules 452 (Prohibit Electioneering by Vote
Collectors), 1625 (Secrecy of Votes) and 1764 (Public Voting) each be
amended by appending to them a paragraph which reads:

      This Rule, apart from this paragraph, has no effect. Two months
      after this paragraph is added to this Rule, this paragraph shall
      be deleted from this Rule.

Be it further resolved that R1859 (Secret Voting), be amended by
replacing in it the paragraph which currently reads:

      Two months after it is created, this Rule repeals itself.

with a paragraph which reads:

      Two months after this paragraph is added to this Rule, this Rule
      repeals itself.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Steve) AI = 1
Extend the ban on Presence

[Comment: despite the unhappiness of some Players with the absence of
Presence (to coin a phrase), I think its effects have been interesting,
even salutary, and that they warrant further investigation. I think it
too deserves a 2 month extension so we can see how much of our present
difficulties with Quorum (which I think have been overstated in any
case) are due to the ban on Presence, and how much to general summer
holiday inactivity.]

Be it hereby resolved that R1715 (Announcing One's Presence) be amended
by appending to it a paragraph which reads:

      This Rule, apart from this paragraph, has no effect. Two months
      after this paragraph is added to this Rule, this paragraph shall
      be deleted from this Rule.

Ratification and Reporting Tweaks

NOTE: What this does is attempt to smooth out a lot of nasty confusions 
in the Ratification process.  Because of a number of authors over the

crept in.  I've fixed the following; The Official Report/Officer's

which are Official Documents, and Official Documents, which are defined 
broadly by 1552.  I've also rewritten the rules to allow mechanisms 
other than proposals to Ratify Documents, permitting Ratification w/o 
Objection to actually work.


Rule 1686 is amended to read as follows;

      For each Office, the Rules may designate a set of information to

      Official Documents.  The only information that is part of an

      The holder of an Office for which there is an Officer's Report

Let the following Rule be Created;
(Title: Initiation and Execution of Ratification)

     Whenever an Official Document is Ratified, there is a time at which 
     the Ratification is Initiated, and a time the Ratification is 
     Executed.

     In the case of Ratification Without Objection, the Ratification is

     appropriate Officer makes a valid (as defined in other Rules) post

     In the case of a Ratification by Proposal, the Ratification is 
     Initiated when the Proposal to Ratify is submitted to the Promotor, 
     and it is Executed when that Proposal is passed.

     If other Rules define alternative methods of Ratifying Official 
     Documents, they must define when Ratifications via those methods 
     are Initiated and Executed, otherwise those methods cannot be used 
     to Ratify any Official Documents.  This Rule takes precedence over 
     any Rule that contradicts its provisions.

     When a Ratification is Executed, the Execution is successful 
     and the Document is Ratified, if, and only if, the Official 
     Document it specifies is still one that is legally valid for 
     Ratification upon such Execution.


Rule 1552 is amended to read as follows;

      In order for an Official Document to be valid for the purpose of
      a Ratification, it must satisfy all the following criteria at
      the time Ratification is Initiated:

           i) The Rules require some specific Player to produce and/or
              maintain the document.
          ii) The Rules required it to be published in the Public
              Forum.  (A requirement that it be sent to all Players
              fulfills this criteria.)
         iii) It is not currently subject to a Claim of Error. (COE)
          iv) It is not currently subject to a pending Call for
              Judgement (CFJ), or a pending Appeal of a CFJ.
           v) The information within the Document has not been
              superseded by a subsequent Document.
          vi) The Document is not the Ruleset. The Ruleset is
              specifically excluded from Ratification.

      Further, a Document can become invalid before Ratification is
      Executed if any of the following occurs before that time:

           i) The Document is superseded by a subsequent Document
              which contradicts the information in the prior Document.
              This does not apply if there is a COE alleging the
              contradiction is an error, and the error is admitted
              before the end of the Proposal's Voting Period.
          ii) A COE is made on the Document, and the COE has not been
              denied before the end of the Proposal's Voting
              Period.
         iii) The Document becomes subject to a pending CFJ or a
              pending appeal of a CFJ.

       If, before a Ratification of a Document is Executed, another
       Document is issued that does not contradict the prior Document, 
       it does not alter the validity of the prior Document.


Rule 1550 is amended to read as follows;

     Ratification of an Official Document shall only be Executed if the 
     Ratification was Initiated via procedures explicitly defined in the 
     Rules and the Ratification explicitly specified a valid Official 
     Document it Ratifies.

     It shall always be permissible to Ratify any valid Official 
     Document by the operation of an adopted Proposal.

     This Rule takes precedence over any rule that would allow a 
     Ratification to be executed in contradiction of its requirements.


Rule 1551 is amended to read as follows;

      Sucessful Execution of a Ratification of an Official Document
      conforms the Game State to what it would be if the valid Official 
      Document thus ratified was completely true and accurate at the 
      time of the Document's publication in the Public Forum.  In other 
      words, the State of the Game, upon such Execution, becomes that
      specified within the Document, plus all subsequent legal changes 
      between the time of its publication and its Ratification was 
      Executed.

      All Game State changes due to the ratification of an Official
      Document occur at the time of such Execution; no retroactive
      effect is expressed or implied.

      A Document, once ratified, is for all legal purposes a true and
      accurate report.  The Game State it references may not be
      retroactively modified prior to the time it was published in the
      Public Forum, even to reflect a prior mistake, retracted or
      illegal move, or an Order.  This Rule takes precedence over
      any Rule that would allow such retroactive alterations or
      corrections to the Game State.

      In no way does the ratification of a Document invalidate,
      reverse, alter or cancel any prior moves or transfers, even
      unrecorded or overlooked ones.  Nor does the ratification of a
      Document change the legality or illegality of any prior move.
      Ratification only adjusts the actual Game State to conform to
      that perceived by the Players and Officers in Official
      Documentation.

      After Ratification of a Document is sucessfully Executed, the
      Player in charge of maintaining that Document shall annotate all 
      subsequent publications of that Document with the date of 
      publication of the last such publication that was ratified..

======================================================================
Proposal 3776 (Repeal-O-Matic) AI = 1
Repeal Rule 1747 (Pardoning Lawlessness)

Rule 1747 is hereby Repealed.

======================================================================
Proposal 3777 (Blob) AI = 1
A collection of small fixes.

[Comment: I have collected together a number of recent proto's I
 have made, into a single proposal, in the hope that people will
 think it is worth spending VTs on.]

Amend Rule 1837 ("The Miscreant") to read:

      Let there exist the Patent Title of "Miscreant".

      If any Player has more than ten Blots, the Player with the most
      Blots earns the Title of Miscreant.  If no Player has the most
      number of Blots, there is no Miscreant.  The Miscreant loses
      eir Title of Miscreant if eir number of Blots drops below ten,
      if another Player gains as many Blots as em, or if another
      Player gains more Blots than em.

      The Herald shall announce in the Public Forum whenever a Player
      receives or loses this Title, as soon as possible after such
      award or revocation occurs.

      A Player with the Title Miscreant counts as two Rebellious 
      Players when determining the outcome of a Revolt. This rule
      takes precedence over any other rule determining the outcome
      of a Revolt.

[Comment: Add a reporting requirement, as per the Samurai, and also
 a precedence clause, so that the last paragraph actually works.]

Amend Rule 879 ("Quorum") to read:

      Quorum for a Proposal is achieved if a vote is cast on that
      Proposal by one-third of Active Players not denied voting 
      privileges, or one-fifth of all Players, whichever is greater.

      Quorum for a Proposal is calculated at the beginning of the 
      prescribed Voting Period for that Proposal, using information
      current at that time.

[Comment: If there are a lot of people who can't vote, it makes
 achieving Quorum rather difficult. This eases the burden.]

Amend Rule 1632 ("InterNomic Voting Procedure") by replacing the text:

      The InterNomic Vote shall be FOR if the Referendum on that
      Proposal has passed and AGAINST if the Referendum on that
      Proposal has failed. If the Referendum on that Proposal is
      undecided, then Agora shall abstain from voting on that
      Proposal.

with:

      The InterNomic Vote shall be FOR if the Referendum on that
      Proposal has passed and AGAINST if the Referendum on that
      Proposal has failed. If the Referendum on that Proposal is
      undecided, then the Ambassador may decide how Agora votes,
      as e sees fit.

[Comment: Not exactly a fix, but a toned down version of my previous
 attempt to empower the Ambasssador. Now e only has power to choose
 when the voting public are too apathetic to tell him how to vote.]

The Nominating Period in the Election for the Office of Registrar
concluded at Thu, 23 Jul 1998 13:13:32 GMT, with only one candidate.
Michael is therefore Elected Registrar by acclamation, and holds the
Office in the normal fashion as of this message. His Term of Service
will expire on 01 Nov 1998.

I order Michael's Score to be increased by 5 Points for winning an
Election.
