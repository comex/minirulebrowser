This Judgement was not delivered within the assigned time and receives no
salary (Rule 591).  However, since he went On Hold I read Rule 1584 as
preventing further penalty, beyond the 0.5 VT which has already been
reported (for going On Hold while a Judge).

  Harlequin goes On Hold, 03 Mar 1998 09:49:45 -0500
  Judged TRUE, 06 Mar 1998 23:08:17 -0500


======================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

R&A : firstly, I contend that Crito's pun, while able to elicit a
brief groan, is not "truly hideous". Secondly, I submit that the
Proposal *contains* a pun, but does not, as a whole, *consist of* a
pun, as required by the Silly Proposal Rule.


======================================================================
Judge's Argument:

I will adress the second point first. While it is true that this proposal
does not, in the most specific sense, completely consist of a single "truly
hideous" pun, I do not agree that this is the proper measure of whether a
Silly Proposal is indeed Silly. As evidence, I submit any number of
previous Silly Proposals, which required a short "setup" beforehand, which
provides the context which allows for the "truly hideous" pun. In this
case, the other paragraphs of the Proposal were required to provide the
context of the pun.

I will now adress the first point raised by the caller. In an issue as
subjective as this, it is difficult for anyone to make a judgement that
will be accepted by anyone, and I am loath to decide just what "truly
hideous" means in this case. Therefore, I am inclined to give the Silly
Proposer the benefit of the doubt: as almost any proposal which contains a
pun that could elicit such a groan, could reasonably be called "truly
hideous," in my judicial opinion, any such proposal should qualify as a
Silly Proposal.

  **Dice rolls: Gen. Chaos, Morendil
  Assigned to Morendil, as of this message


======================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

The last sentence of rule 1766 states that 'This provision shall not
increase the maximum number of votes that are permitted to be cast by
that Player.' The previous sentence states '... then that Player may
cast two additional votes on that Proposal beyond what e is otherwise
entitled to cast.' I argue that the first sentence would, in fact,
raise the maximum number of votes above what it would otherwise be
(two), and thus the second sentence renders that null.

Rule 206 says that 'Each Voting Entity has two votes on a proposal,
unless another Rule says otherwise.' This clearly establishes a
maximum number of legal votes. The second sentence of that paragraph
says 'However, no such Entity shall have more than five votes on any
Proposal, regardless of what any other Rule may say to the contrary.'
This establishes a second maximum on the number of votes which may
legally cast, such that the maximum equates to 'two, plus any granted
by other rules, or five, whichever is lower'.


======================================================================
Evidence supplied by Caller:

Rule 206/10 (Power=2)
Voting Entities and Votes

      A Voting Entity is an Entity which is generally authorized by
      the Rules to cast a vote or votes on a Proposal, although other
      Rules may withdraw this authorization from a Voting Entity in
      specific circumstances without that Entity thereby ceasing to be
      a Voting Entity. No Entity is permitted to vote on a Proposal
      unless it is a Voting Entity, and only those Entities designated
      by the Rules to be Voting Entities are Voting Entities. Players
      and Groups are Voting Entities.

      Each Voting Entity has two votes on a Proposal, unless another
      Rule says otherwise. However, no such Entity shall have more
      than five votes on any Proposal, regardless of what any other
      Rule may say to the contrary.

Rule 1766/0 (Power=1)
The Officer's Vote

      If a particular Proposal amends the duties or description of a
      particular Office, and a Player holds that Office in normal
      fashion, and that Player is not the same Player who Proposed the
      Proposal, then that Player may cast two additional votes on that
      Proposal beyond what e is otherwise entitled to cast.  This
      shall not increase the maximum number of votes that are
      permitted to be cast by that Player.

Changes Since Last Report
======================================================================

Date: Wed, 4 Mar 1998 13:14:12 +1100 (EST)

   3698 Kolja A.       1 Buying points

Style Change: 0

An interesting if fairly small idea, but Style neutral.

   3704 Gen Chaos      1 The Omnibus Reform Act of 1998

Style Change: +3

This Proposal is probably big enough to be beyond considerations of
mere Style. But still, it's a vastly impressive achievement. In
particular, General Chaos has laboured mightily to bring clarity
to a Proposal which could have been almost impossible to digest.
The fact that one is able to read it, keep track of it, and even
understand more or less what it will do is a tribute to him. Very
Stylishly done.

   3709 Steve          1 Groups can vote in Referenda

Style Change: 0

Proposal made by the Wizard.

   3710 Swann          1 The Great Officer's Veto Scam Proposal

Style Change: 0

Although a very Stylish Proposal in my view, its real author is for
the most part elJefe.

   3713 Blob           1 Risky Rebellion

Style Change: +1

A fairly complicated idea nicely handled.

Date: Mon, 9 Mar 1998 11:39:24 +1100 (EST)

   3700 Swann          1 Ratification w/o Objection

Style Change: +1

A nice use of the W/O mechanism.

   3701 Swann          1 untitled (Proposal Applications)

Style Change: 0

I don't really see the point, myself.

   3702 R-O-M          3 Repeal Rule 113 (Players may always opt out)

Style Change: 0

Repeal-O-Matic Proposals are all Style neutral in my view.

   3714 Crito          1 Limited Indulgence Distribution

Style Change: +1

Indulgence scarcity. About time.

   3715 Blob           1 Standing Down

Style Change: +1

Interesting idea. Big change to our political scene if adopted.

Text of Adopted Proposals
======================================================================

Proposal 3703 (Steve)  AI = 1
Speaker Transition Reform

Be it hereby resolved that R402 (Speaker Transition) be amended to read:

      Speaker Transition is a process which commences at the time
      the Rules call for a Speaker Transition to occur, and which
      proceeds as follows:

      (i) when the Speaker Transition commences, the Speaker loses
      all special rights and privileges that accrue to em as a result
      of being Speaker;

      (ii) as soon as possible after the Speaker Transition
      commences, the Registrar shall post to the Public Forum a
      Notice of Speaker Transition, identifying the reason for the
      Transition and the Player who held the Office of Speaker-Elect
      at the time the Transition commenced;

      (iii) provided that the Notice of Speaker Transition is
      correct in its particulars, the posting of the Notice
      causes the Player identified in it to cease being the
      Speaker-Elect and to become the Speaker. This concludes
      the process of Speaker Transition.

[Comment: (i) ensures justice; during a Transition, one remains Speaker
in name only. (ii) ensures certainty about identity of the Speaker;
the Speaker only changes when the Registrar says so, so there's no
chance of a change of Speaker going unnoticed. (iii) ensures certainty
about the identity of the Speaker in a different way: if the holder
of the Office of Speaker-Elect changes after the commencment of the
Transition but before the Registrar's Notice, the succession is not
affected.]

Be it further resolved that R1648 (When the Speaker is Tainted) be
amended to read:

      If the Rules require that a Speaker Transition occur, and
      the Office of Speaker-Elect is not being held in the normal
      fashion at that time, then the Transition proceeds as set
      out in other Rules, but the new Speaker is Tainted.

      A Tainted Speaker may remain Speaker only until some other
      Player holds the Office of Speaker-Elect in normal fashion, at
      which point, a Speaker Transition occurs.

[Comment: post-Revolt Speakers are not necessarily Tainted.]

Be it further resolved that R1664 (Rebellion) be amended by replacing
the text in it which currently reads:

      - The Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker

with text which reads:

      - a Speaker Transition occurs.

Be it further resolved that R681 (Giving up the Speakership) be amended
to read:

      If the Speaker announces in the Public Forum that e is giving
      up the Speakership voluntarily, a Speaker Transition occurs.

      As soon as possible after the Transition is completed, the
      new Speaker shall bill the former Speaker one Voting Token.

      When a Speaker voluntarily gives up the Speakership in this
      manner, e is prevented from nominating emself for the Office of
      Speaker-Elect for a period lasting two weeks, or until the
      start of the next quarter, whichever is longest.

[Comment: makes R681 PC-compliant, and closes a loophole I once
exploited to achieve consecutive 3 month terms as Speaker.]

Be it further resolved that R1375 (Speaker Going On Hold) be amended to
read:

      A Speaker who goes On Hold while e is still Speaker commits the
      Crime of Speaker Inactivity, a Class B Crime.

      If the Speaker is On Hold, a Speaker Transition occurs.

Be it further resolved that R942 be repealed.

[Comment: a hopeless mess.]

Be it further resolved that that R1581 (Quarterly Speaker Change) be
amended to read:

      A Speaker Transition occurs upon the commencement of each
      new quarter.

======================================================================

Proposal 3705 (Crito)  AI = 2  (Silly when submitted)
Cantus Cygneus

Create a Rule with the following text:

      Whenever a Player feels that e has been treated so egregiously by
      the Agoran community that e can no longer abide to be a part of it,
      e may submit a document to the Clerk of the Courts, clearly labeled
      a Cantus Cygneus, detailing eir grievances and expressing eir
      reproach for those who ey feel have treated em so badly.

      As soon as possible after receiving a Cantus Cygneus, the Clerk of
      the Courts shall post this document to the Public Forum along with a
      Writ of Fugere Agorae Grandissima Exprobratione, commanding the
      Player to be deregistered and instructing the Registrar to note
      the method of deregistration for that Player in subsequent
      Registrar Reports, as long as the Player remains deregistered.

      The Player is deregistered as of the posting of the Writ, and the
      notation in the Registrar's Report will ensure that, henceforth,
      all may know said Player deregistered in a Writ of FAGE.

Proposal 3706 (Harlequin)  AI = 2
Fix Proposal Numbering

Amend Rule 109 ("Proposal Numbers") to read:

      At the time e distributes it, the Promotor shall give each Proposal 
      a Number for reference.  The Number of a Proposal shall be the least 
      integer greater than all other Numbers previously assigned to a 
      Proposal (including numbers assigned to Proposals later determined 
      to have been incorrectly submitted), or 301, whichever is greater.

Amend Rule 1036 ("The Proposal Queue") by replacing the text reading:

      As soon as possible after the Promotor receives a new Proposal,
      e shall assign to it a Number as specified in other Rules.
      E shall then place this Proposal on the Proposal Queue.

With text reading:

      As soon as possible after the Promotor receives a new Proposal,
      e shall place this Proposal in the Proposal Queue.

Amend Rule 1753 ("Repeal-O-Matic") by replacing the text reading:

      For each Rule picked by the Promotor, the Repeal-O-Matic Rule
      shall submit a Proposal that consists of the following quoted
      text, with substitutions mandated by this Rule:

With text reading:

      For each Rule picked by the Promotor, e shall send a message
      to the Public Forum, acting as the Repeal-O-Matic's Executor,
      submitting a Proposal that consists of the following quoted
      text, with substitutions mandated by this Rule:

======================================================================

Proposal 3707 (Steve)  AI = 1
Delegation, Revolt & Perpetuity

[Comment: this fixes two bugs: you can't escape facing election
after a Revolt by delegating, and you don't lose the status of holding
your Office in Perpetuity if you delegate. I regard this patch as
temporary; the Officer Rules need an overhaul along lines sketched
by Oerjan. This will do for now.]

Be it hereby resolved that R1645 (Temporary Delegation of Office)
be amended by replacing the text in it which currently reads:

      At the end of the Period of Delegation, the Delegated Player
      ceases to hold the Delegated Office, and the Delegating Player
      resumes holding the Office in the normal fashion, unless the
      Term of Service for that Office has expired.  In that case, the
      Delegated Player continues to hold the Office temporarily,
      although the Office ceases to be a delegated Office.

with text which reads:

      At the end of the Period of Delegation, the Delegated Player
      ceases to hold the Delegated Office, and the Delegating Player
      resumes holding the Office in the normal fashion, unless the
      Term of Service for that Office has expired, or a Revolt
      occurred during the Period of Delegation. If the Term of
      Service expired, the Delegated Player continues to hold the
      Office temporarily, although the Office ceases to be a
      delegated Office. If a Revolt occurred during the Period of
      Delegation, and at the end of the Period of Delegation no
      other Player is holding the Office in the normal fashion, the
      Delegating Player resumes holding the Office, but temporarily, 

Be it further resolved that R1758 (Holding an Office in Perpetuity)
be amended to read:

      If a certain Office is held in the normal fashion by a Player,
      then the Registrar may declare Without Objection that that
      Player holds the Office in perpetuity.

      The Term of Service of an Office held in perpetuity shall never
      expire, and a Player holding an Office in perpetuity continues
      to hold the Office in perpetuity while e holds the Office. If a
      Player holding an Office in perpetuity delegates the Office to
      another Player, then, if e resumes holding the Office in the
      normal fashion at the end of the Period of Delegation, e also
      resumes holding the Office in perpetuity.

      This Rule takes precedence over other rules defining the expiry
      of an Office's Term of Service.

======================================================================

Proposal 3710 (Swann)  AI = 1
 The Great Officer's Veto Scam Proposal

This is an Urgent Proposal.

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 1766 be amended to read:

      If a particular Proposal amends the duties or description of a
      particular Office, and a Player holds that Office in normal
      fashion, and that Player is not the same Player who Proposed the
      Proposal, then that Player may cast two additional votes AGAINST
      that Proposal beyond what e is otherwise entitled to cast.  This
      shall not increase the maximum number of votes that are
      permitted to be cast by that Player.

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled 'A Win for Threat',
be created with the following text:

      The members of The Threat win the game upon creation of this
      Rule. This takes precedence over Rules that would prevent any
      of them from winning the game at that time.

      All members of The Threat are granted the Patent Title "Threat
      to the Game".

      Player Swann shall also win the game, and be granted the Patent
      Title, "Loose Cannon."

      At 12:00 GMT on 31 March 1998, this Rule and the Rule "Officer's
      Veto Scam" are repealed.

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled 'Officer's Veto Scam',
be created with the following text:

      When a Win occurs under authority of the Rule "A Win For Threat"
      then the Assessor, Speaker-Elect, Commander-in-Chief, and Clerk
      of the Courts are all required, in addition to any other duties
      they may have, to detect and report that win in the Public Forum,
      within one week.

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule entitled "Threat Trombones" be created
with the following text:

      This Rule can empower the Threat Vizier to create an instrument
      of Power 4.  This Rule takes precedence over any Rule that would
      prevent it from so doing.

      The Threat Vizier shall have the power to create an instrument
      of Power 4 called a Threat Trombone, whose content shall be to
      change the Power of any Rule or Rules created by the Proposal
      which created this Rule, E creates and executes such an instrument
      by posting it in the Public Forum, and the provisions contained
      in the text of that Instrument are implemented, any Rule to the
      contrary notwithstanding.

      This rule repeals itself at 12:00 GMT on 31 March 1998.

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule be created with the following text:

      No instrument can create, or empower another entity to
      create, another instrument with a Power greater than its own
      Power.  This Rule takes precedence over any Rule that specifies
      the Power of the created instrument.  Proposals are explicitly
      exempt from this provision.

      Instruments created by the Rule "Threat Trombones" are also
      explicitly exempt from the preceding provisions. This paragraph
      deletes itself at 12:00 GMT on 31 March 1998.

      In the specific case of Proposals, a Proposal shall have
      a Power equal to its Adoption Index.  In no case shall a
      Proposal take effect unless its Voting Index exceeds its
      Adoption Index, (or equals it in the case both equal
      Unanimity) and the Rules otherwise permit it to take
      effect.  A Proposal cannot create an instrument with a
      Power that exceeds the Proposal's Power.

      If an instrument creates another instrument, and fails to
      specify a legal Power for the created instrument, the
      Power of the new instrument is 1.

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled 'A Monument to the Threat',
be created with the following text:

      This Rule commemorates the Glorious and Dramatic Wins achieved
      by the Members of the Threat, Blob, elJefe, General Chaos and
      Steve, with the passage of Proposal <proposal numberat time
      <time>, which were made possible primarily by exploiting a loophole
      in the Rule 'Officer's Veto'.

      This Rule also commemerates the Unexpected and Surprising Win
      achieved by Swann, who, working independently, achieved and nearly
      implemented eir own scam to close the loophole in the Instrument Rules,
      which would have screwed this all up if he hadn't agreed to join this
      scam in exchange for this paragraph.

Be it further resolved that the Rule 'A Monument to the Threat' be
amended by replacing in it the text '<proposal number>' with the number
of the Proposal containing this provision, and the text '<time>' with
the time at which that Proposal took effect.
