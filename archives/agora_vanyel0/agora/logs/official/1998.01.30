    "Chuck incorrectly stated that Andre, Blob, Crito, ElJefe,

  Judged TRUE, 29 Jan 1998 08:42:25 -0500


======================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

I quote Rule 1431/10 (Power=1)
Claims of Error

      A Response must be provided by the Player who is required by the
      Rules to publish the information subject to a Claim within one
      week of the Claim being made, unless any of the following holds:
       * a previous Claim was made concerning the same error
       * the relevant message has been posted more than 21 days before
       * another message by the same Player has corrected the error

      A Player who fails to post a Response within the alloted time
      commits the Infraction of Delayed COE Response, carrying a
      penalty of 1 Blot, to be reported by the Player who posted the
      Claim. A Player who incorrectly issues a denial of a Claim
      commits the Crime of Wrongful COE Denial, a Class 1 Crime,
      unless e then admits the Claim within 72 hours after the
      incorrect denial.

None of us were "the Player who is required by the Rules to publish the
information subject to a Claim", as I find no Rule that _requires_ anyone to
publish the information subject to this Claim, therefore the Rule states no
allotted time for a Response from any of us. We have therefore not yet
failed to
respond within the (unspecified) allotted time.   :oP

======================================================================
Judge's Arguments:

CFJ 1082 asks the question whether Chuck's report of multiple
Infractions of Delayed COE Response regarding his COE on the report of
Harlequin's Win (reported by Harlequin) was in error.  This Court
finds that the all such reports were erroneous.  There are several
related issues, which will be taken up below.

First, whether an error existed:  This Court finds that there was in
fact an error, adopting without discussion the ruling of our sister
Court in CFJ 1081.

Second, whether an admission of the error pursuant to the COE was
required as a consequence of the error: This Court finds that no
Player was obliged to respond to Chuck's COE because no Player is
obliged by the Rules to post announcement of Player Wins by the
Insanity Rule, and thus there was no "Player who is required by the
Rules to publish the information subject to a Claim" (Rule 1431/10).

Third, whether Rule 1431's fourth paragraph establishes an Infraction
for any Player who fails to respond to a Claim, irregardless of
whether e is required to do so by Rule 1431's third paragraph: This
Court finds that, while the position apparently adopted by Chuck in
attempting to impose the Infractions is not directly excluded by the
language of Rule 1431, it seems reasonably clear that the referent of
"A Player who fails to post a Response within the alloted time" should
be and is restricted to those Players who are actually obliged to do
so, under Rule 1431's third paragraph.  Therefore, it is this Court's
opinion that Rule 1431's fourth paragraph establishes no liability for
Players other than those named by Rule 1431's third paragraph.

Thus, while the Claim of Error was correct, and there was an error,
the Rules do not require any Player to admit the error, and do not
allow the imposition of an Infraction upon any Player for failing to
do so.  The alleged Infractions did not occur, and Chuck's report of
them was erroneous.  This Court is not asked to consider the question
of whether Chuck's report of these alleged Infractions, and the
Payment Orders e alleged to execute at the same time time, were in
fact valid, and thus will not take up that question.

Judgement of TRUE is entered.  It is so ordered.

  Appeal of Injunction:
    Assigned to Morendil, elJefe, General Chaos, as of this message


======================================================================
Injunction by Judge Time Agent:

      I hereby retract Harlequin's win.  Harlequin's
      Champion's Reward is hereby revoked, and any benefits
      thereof are no longer valid.  The Registrar must vacate
      the 10 VT PO due to this false win.  Any other benefit
      or reward that is not specifically named herein that is
      a direct result of said false win must also be
      removed/deleted/returned.


======================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

Harlequin alleges that he did win the Game at that time, due
to Rule 1729.  I present two separate arguments why e did
not (the second applies only if the Judge rejects the first
argument).

I. Rule 1729 states, in part,

      And should it occur (due to greed or sin)
      that no one Votes FOR it, the Proposer shall Win.

In CFJ 1078, Judge Blob ruled that Morendil *did* vote on P3640,
and thus was guilty of the violation of R1729, despite the fact
that the votes were later retracted.  Thus, in accordance with
CFJ 1078, Morendil did vote FOR it (e voted once FOR and once
AGAINST), and thus Harlequin did not win.

It has been suggested that "vote" can have more than one meaning
in the Rules, depending on context.  I will grant that the meaning
of "vote" differs depending on whether it is a noun or a verb, and
if the object of the vote is an Agora Proposal, Referendum, or Internomic
Proposal.  *However*, I find no use of the word "vote" as a verb
in reference to Agora Proposals in the Ruleset which would support
any interpretation other than that in the Judgement of CFJ 1078.

II. If the Judge rejects my argument above, I contend that Harlequin
still did not win, in that the reason that no one voted on P3640
was because it was against the Rules, and not "due to greed or sin"
as spelled out in R1729.

It has been objected that, as "due to greed or sin" is in parentheses,
it is meant only as an example, and not limiting on the wins which
might otherwise be permitted by R1729.  IMO, without a "for example,"
or "e.g.," in the parenthetical phrase, the most natural reading of
it is synonymous with an equivalent non-parenthetical phrase.

It has also been objected that not voting because it was against
the Rules is also due to greed, i.e., a desire to avoid the
penalty associated with breaking a Rule.  This is an overbroad
and non-standard interpretation of the word "greed."  For example,
my prime motivation in not speeding on the freeway may be a desire
to avoid the monetary penalty which may be involved, but this would
not be called greed.

======================================================================
Judge's Argument:

Discussion:  Caller Chuck's first argument references Judge Blob's
             judgment in CFJ 1078.  I find that the same reasoning
             applies in this case.

             Since Morendil was found to have voted in that case, it
             matters not that the vote was later retracted.  Morendil
             did, indeed, vote FOR P3640, thus disallowing Harlequin
             a win by R1729.

Note:        Due to this line of reasoning, it will be quite easy to
             prevent any Player from winning by Rule 1729 by simply
             having at least one player vote FOR an Insane Proposal
             and then immediately retract it.  If someone wishes to
             remedy the situation, R1729 will have to be amended to
             state something along the lines of only counting the
             final tally in determination of a win.


======================================================================
Arguments of Appellant Oerjan:

I Call for the Appeal of this Injunction, as I believe it is not entirely
legal and appropriate.

> Injunction:  I hereby retract Harlequin's win.  Harlequin's
>              Champion's Reward is hereby revoked, and any benefits
>              thereof are no longer valid.

This part does not appear to be in the form of an order to perform or fail
to perform actions.

> The Registrar must vacate the 10 VT PO due to this false win.

This part does not confirm to Rule 1733, which clearly specifies that such
Injunctions shall specify the Clerk of the Courts to make such Vacations.

> Any other benefit or reward that is not specifically named herein that
> is a direct result of said false win must also be
> removed/deleted/returned.

This part violates part (i) and (iv) of Rule 663.  Moreover, as Champion's
Reward is still Platonically defined there is no need nor possibility for
using an Injunction to reverse it, even if this had been within a Judge's
general powers.  No possibility because there are no actions defined that
would reverse it; no need because it is automatically reversed since its
preconditions did not occur.

As we are planning and will (no doubt) soon have reforms to change this,
it is understandable that a future Time Agent would be confused about
this;  but the powers to make corrective Injunctions are still rather
limited, and the game is still partially based on automatic events rather
than Player actions.

Text of Adopted Proposals
======================================================================

Proposal 3670 (Swann)  AI = 1
Inform the Assessor whence come yer Votes

Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: Attributing Additional Votes)

     For each vote beyond the first two an entity casts on a particular 
     Proposal, that entity must provide to the Assessor the Rule Numbers 
     of the Rules that permit the casting of that additional vote.  If 
     these Rule Numbers are not provided to the Assessor before the end 
     of the voting period for that Proposal, the Assessor has the option
     to not count more than two votes on that Proposal from that entity.

{Comment: I want to add a number of Rules that allow entities to cast 
          additional votes, so I thought that this might make the 
          Assessor's life easier.}
 
======================================================================

Proposal 3671 (Swann)  AI = 1
Officer's Veto

Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: The Officer's Vote)

     If a particular Proposal amends the duties or description of a 
     particular Office, and a Player holds that Office in normal 
     fashion, and that Player is not the same Player who Proposed the 
     Proposal, then that Player may cast two additional votes on that 
     Proposal beyond what e is otherwise entitled to cast.  This shall 
     not increase the maximum number of votes that are permitted to be
     cast by that Player.

{Comment: Pretty self-explanatory.  It's meant to give an Officer a
          little more voice in the running of eir job.}

======================================================================

Proposal 3672 (Repeal-O-Matic)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Repeal Rule 1700

Rule 1700 is hereby repealed.

======================================================================

Proposal 3673 (Steve)  AI = 1
Tweak R1465 (Champion's Reward)

[Comment: R1465 was incompletely pragmatized by PC: strictly speaking,
it is impossible for the Registrar to pay out the VTs 'at the onset'
of the Champion's Reward.]

Be it hereby resolved that R1465 (Champion's Reward) be amended by
replacing the text

      At the onset of that Player's Champion's Reward, the Registrar
      shall pay out ten VTs to that Player.

with the text

      As soon as possible after the legal and correct announcement
      that a Player has won a Game, the Registrar shall pay out ten
      Voting Tokens to that Player.

======================================================================

Proposal 3674 (Steve)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Real VT scarcity *now*

[Comment: as promised, a proto for real VT scarcity, now. I've opted
for direct VT destruction for getting VTs back, rather than the much
more complex issuing of POs by the Chancellor, which would require
each Executor to make a Transfer Order returning their VTs to the
Bank. The paying out of VTs can be done simply by issuing TOs from
the Bank by the Chancellor, though, so I've opted for that. I note
that PC appears to have negated that effects of reforming R594: we're
back to the situation where you need to propose self-repealing Rules
to make game state changes by Proposal.]

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule be created with the following text:

      Upon the creation of this Rule, all Voting Tokens are
      destroyed. Furthermore, as soon as possible after the creation
      of this Rule, the Chancellor shall, for each Player, execute a
      Transfer Order for five Voting Tokens, naming the Bank as
      payor, and that Player as the payee.

      This Rule shall repeal itself as soon as the Chancellor
      has executed the Transfer Orders required by it.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would
      prevent VTs from being destroyed.

======================================================================

Proposal 3675 (Michael)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
The Rulekeepor should have an Official Report

Amend Rule 1051 "The Office of the Rulekeepor" by replacing the second
paragraph with the following text:

      The Rulekeepor shall maintain a complete list of all Rules.  The
      Short Logical Ruleset constitutes the Rulekeepor's Official
      Report. In addition, the Rulekeepor shall post the Full Logical
      Ruleset to the Public Forum at least once each month.

======================================================================

Proposal 3676 (General Chaos)  AI = 1
Evidentiary status of Officer Reports

Be it therefore resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      The published Report of an Officer constitutes prima facie
      evidence of the truth of those matters reported therein which
      that Officer is required by law to report.  This presumption may
      be set aside only by clear and convincing evidence to the
      contrary.

======================================================================

Proposal 3679 (General Chaos)  AI = 2
Holidays

Be it therefore resolved, that the following Rule be created, at Power
2:

      A Holiday is a period of time, not to exceed 7 days in length,
      designated as such by the Rules.  If one Holiday begins
      within 24 hours of the end of another Holiday, the two Holidays
      and the time between them are taken as a single Holiday, unless
      this would cause the combined Holiday to exceed 7 days in
      length, in which case the first Holiday is extended to 7 days
      and the second Holiday does not occur.

      During a Holiday, no Proposal may be distributed by the
      Promotor, nor may any Call for Judgement, Judgement, notice of
      Appeal, Decision of Appeals Boards, or Opinion be published by
      the Clerk of the Courts; however, if any of the above do take
      place during the Holiday in violation of this Rule, this Rule
      does not deprive them of their usual effects.  

      If some Rule requires that an action be done prior to a
      given time, and that given time falls during a Holiday, or
      within the twenty-four-hour period immediately following that
      Holiday, then that action need not be done until twenty-four
      hours after that Holiday ends.  If some Rule bases the time of a
      future event upon the time of another event, or requires that a
      Player perform some action within some time of another event,
      and that event occurs during a Holiday, the time at which the
      Holiday ends shall be used instead for the purpose of
      determining the time of the future event or of the time by which
      the Player must perform the specified action.  

      This Rule takes precedence over all Rules pertaining to the
      timing of events, and over all Rules which require Players to
      perform events before a specified time.
