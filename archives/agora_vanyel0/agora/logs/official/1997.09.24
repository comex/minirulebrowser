COE admitted.  The above quoted line should say "2.0 VT", not "1.0 VT".

>>Bank    Crito           1.0 VT   Herald's Salary for W1997-38

The above Payment Order is hereby vacated.  The Bank is hereby commanded
to pay 2.0 VT to Crito.

COE admitted. By the way, I hereby make and admit an equal COE on CFJ 971.

This means I will have to do the assignments again as well. According to
existing Game Custom I will do this in the following way: I roll a D20,
if it's 1-17 the assignment will stay as it was, an 18 gives Blob, a 19
Elde. This resulted in th following CFJs being reassigned:

948: Blob
966: Blob
975: Elde
977: Blob
983: Blob
987: Elde
989: Elde
1004: Elde
1014: Elde
1027: Blob

I will regard the 10 CFJs above as being assigned As of this message,
while the others will be regarded as assigned as of the previous message.

The relevant parts of the mail become:

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

======================================================================

Complete text of the mail in which the CFJ was called (I am obliged
to publish this with this CFJ, I think)

I do not dismiss CFJ 962 per 1565/iii ("Its Statement does not relate to a
matter relevant to the Rules").  The Statement of CFJ 962 obviously relates
to CFJ 962 itself, which is a matter relevant to the Rules.  (If this
argument is to be believed, then no CFJ may be dismissed per 1565/iii,
which should therefore be reworded.)

However, I do dismiss CFJ 962 on the following grounds:

* 1565/vi:   After a reasonable effort by the Judge to obtain all relevant
               information, no determination can be made of the truth or
               falsity of its Statement.
* 1563:      Its Statement is unable to be determined by the means of
               logical reasoning, with the presumption of perfect knowledge,
               to be either TRUE or FALSE.

I interpret these clauses as they were surely intended, namely "no
determination can be made as to whether or not its Statement is true"
and "It is impossible to determine ... whether or not its Statement is
true", as opposed to the alternate convoluted interpretations that have
recently been offered.

I dismiss CFJ  978, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ  982, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ  984, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ  989, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ  990, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ  994, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1019, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1021, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1022, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1026, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1027, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1032, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1036, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1043, on the same grounds.

I'll take my 45 Mil in 5-Mark notes, please.  :)

I hereby Call For Judgement on the following Statement:

     This statement is false.

Also, would anyone like a MIDI version of Bach's Musical Offering?  (A bit
