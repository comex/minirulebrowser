Proposal 3747 (Steve) AI = 1
The Levers of Monetary Policy

[Comment: this Proposal introduces two new levers for control over
monetary policy: it gives the Accountor the ability, by levying
taxes, to keep the number of VTs in circulation limited to what I
have called the Voting Token Circulation Level, which e can set, and
it give the Chancellor the power to set the Basic Officer Salary. The
aim here is to give us flexibility; we can adjust important economic
parameters without having to pass a Proposal. Also, these decisions
then become a matter of Officer politics, which should be interesting.
I have written the Taxation Rule so that it covers the cases of other
Currencies, should we wish to extend the use of this tool to cover them.]

Be it further resolved that a Rule entitled "Circulation of Voting
Tokens" be created with the following text:

      An amount of Currency is in circulation if it exists and is not
      possessed by the Bank.

      The Voting Token Circulation Level is a number which indicates
      an approximate upper limit on how many Voting Tokens per Player
      are in circulation.

      The Accountor can set the Voting Token Circulation Level by
      announcing in the Public Forum that e is doing so, provided
      that e announces a value between 0 and 15 inclusive, and that
      the Voting Token Circulation Level has not already been set by
      a similar such announcement earlier in the Week.

      The Accountor is responsible for ensuring that the number of
      Voting Tokens per Player in circulation does not exceed the
      Voting Token Circulation Level. To this end, at any time at
      which the number of Voting Tokens per Player in circulation
      does exceed the Voting Token Circulation Level, but only at
      such a time, the Accountor is empowered and required to levy a
      tax on Voting Tokens, as described in other Rules.

Be it further resolved that a Rule entitled "Levying Taxes" be created
with the following text:

      When (and only when) a Player is empowered to levy a tax on a
      Currency, e may do so by announcing the levy in the Public
      Forum. The announcement must specify which Currency the tax in
      being levied on (and this must be a Currency on which the Player
      making the announcement is empowered to levy a tax), and the
      amount of the levy, expressed as a percentage of holdings of
      that Currency, not in excess of fifty percent, which each
      entity in possession of that Currency will be required to pay
      to the Bank (the levy must be the same for all entities).
      Finally, the announcement must contain Payment Orders naming
      each entity in possession of the named Currency as payor, and
      with the Bank as payee, for an amount of the named Currency
      equal to the amount of the levy. 

Be it further resolved that R1007 (Salaries of Officers) be amended
by replacing in it the text which currently reads 

      There shall be a Basic Officer Salary, which is equal to 1 VT.

with text which reads 

      There is a Basic Officer Salary, equal to a number of Voting
      Tokens, the level of which is set by the Chancellor, as
      described in other Rules.

Be it further resolved that a Rule entitled "The Chancellor can set
the Basic Officer Salary" be created with the following text:

      The Chancellor can set the level of the Basic Officer Salary
      by announcing in the Public Forum that e is doing so, provided
      that e announces a value between 0 VTs and 2 VTs inclusive,
      that e makes the announcement before midnight GMT Thursday, and
      that the Basic Officer Salary has not already been set by a
      similar such announcement earlier in the Week.

History:
  Called by Swann, Wed, 20 May 1998 18:05:48 -0400
  Assigned to Steve, as of this message

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Part I: What is an Order and was Swann's post a series of Orders?

>From Rule 1793;

     "An Order is a command, executed by a Player and directed to some
      entity requiring that entity to perform exactly one action, or
      to refrain from performing one or more actions."

In addition, Rule 1794 (qv) defines several classes of orders.  Of the
four classes so defined, the Orders Swann issued would be classified as
private, in that they were not issued under the authority of a Judge,
Justice, or an Officer.  Nowhere in the Rules-- and pointedly so given
the pragmatic intent of the Rules in question-- is there a Rule that
would prevent any communication fulfilling the criteria of Rule 1793
from being an Order, and therefore having the characteristics the Rules
ascribe to Orders in general.  This means that _any_ communication
fulfilling 1793's criteria is an Order.  Since the communication
referred to in the statement was a series of commands, executed by a
Player (Swann) to individual entities (Players notified through the
Public Forum, which by definition goes to every Player) requiring those
entities to refrain from performing one or more actions (i.e., refrain
from issuing any Order of a type not explicitly defined by the Rules,
and refrain from issuing any Order that the Player is not explicitly
empowered by the Rules to issue.)  Given the nature of the Rules
governing Orders, I believe that it is self-evident that the
communication involved was a series of Orders. (The Rules governing
Orders are written to provide for anyone to issue an Order, the only
legal recourse is the determination of the Order's validity.)

Part II: Were these Orders Valid?

The relevant portion from Rule 1796;

      In order to be proven valid by CFJ, the Rules must permit the
      Player who executed the Order in question to execute such an
      Order, that the execution of the Order must have been required
      by or permitted in the circumstances which existed at the time
      it was executed, and that the Order has not been rendered
      invalid by the operation of any other Rule.

Since these are private Orders of a type not explicitly defined in the
Rules (or, of a type only defined in 1794) this is the only part of the
Rules that defines the validity or invalidity of the given Orders.  So
we must determine three things;

Part II.i: Do the Rules permit Swann to execute an arbitrary private
           Order?

The oft-quoted Rule 166;

     "Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
      and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
      which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly
      or implicitly permits it."

This is an often abused rule, especially in the case of scams like the
present one.  But, in the narrow case of the question we are asking, it
 is absolutely applicable.  1796 asks, do the Rules permit a Player to
issue this Order.  Rule 166 responds, forcefully, "barring any Rules to
the contrary, the answer is yes."  Are there any contrary rules?  There
are, in fact, none.  There is no Rule that prohibits any player from
issuing any private Order e deems appropriate.  (There is, in fact, very
little restriction on who can issue orders outside the definitions for
the various classes, which renders a strong sounding criteria
practically void of any real effect.)

Part II.ii: Do the Rules "require or permit" the execution of Swann's
            Orders in the circumstances which existed at the time they
            were executed?

First off, the strong criterion, "require" is mooted by the weaker
criterion, "permit."  By Rule 116, if the Rules don't prohibit the Order
in the given circumstances, they permit it.  Again, there is no explicit
restriction in the Rules upon the execution of an arbitrary private
Order.  There are a set of other "circumstances" that could trigger this
clause if they existed; They would be the operation of an SLC, *or a
prior Order.*  Neither of these apply to Swann in the given situation.
However, these "circumstances" now apply to all the Players subject to
Swann's Orders.

Part II.iii: Have Swann's Orders been rendered invalid by the operation
             of any other Rule?

This provision is mostly redundant, but is an opportunity to emphasize
again-- no Rule prohibited the execution of the Orders given by Swann,
and given the nature of the Rules governing Orders, and the existence of
Rule 116, the lack of such a prohibition is all that is required for
these (or any) Orders to have their effect.  In conclusion, it is an
obvious conclusion that the Orders given by Swann do indeed fulfill all
the criteria for validity as provided by Rule 1796.

Part III: Are such arbitrary Private Orders effective?  Do the Rules
          require the Players so Ordered to obey them?

>From Rule 1811;

     "Any entity who, while required by an Order to refrain from
      performing an action, performs the proscribed action while the
      Order is in effect commits the Crime of Contempt by Action, a
      Class C Crime."

This Rule clinches the idea that to violate these Orders is, in fact,
"breaking the Rules."  I believe that there is a strong Game Custom to
 the effect that committing an action defined as a Crime is "breaking
the Rules."  It is the pragmatic nature of the Order Rules that gives us
the above construction rather than, "A Player shall do what an order
tells em to, if e does not..."  Which makes little sense to a true
pragmatist.  It is my opinion that the above construction, and game
custom regarding Crimes, makes it "illegal" for someone to "break the
Rules" by failing to comply with a valid Order.  I include this and the
following section simply as an addendum to the Agoran community.

Part IV: The Caller's Beliefs and Intents;

I believe that my actions were and are legal.  I believe that my Orders
were and are valid, and I believe that those Orders will prevent similar
orders by other Players from being valid (by the reasoning I gave
re:1796 about the circumstances rendering an Order invalid).  I believe
that this loophole exists, and is a very grave one-- obviously in that
it gives the first player to exploit it absolute power to Order Players
around.  I believe that it is in the best interest of Agora that this
loophole be exploited in exactly the way I am exploiting it, rather than
in a slow evolution of micro-scams that could cause antipathy among
players and unbalance our economy.  Despite the power this grants me, I
intend to shortly propose a fix (which I will Order everyone to vote for
:) which will grant me some measure of recognition for what is, in fact,
a move that changes-- temporarily at least--  Agora into Imperial Nomic
XXX.  I also would like to express an admiration for the Order rules in
general, I do *not* think this loophole is a systemic problem.  It can
be alleviated by a rule that invalidates any Order not explicitly
defined in the Rules.  The order rules are a new paradigm, which can be
seen by the amendment numbers of zero on most of the Rules.  It is a
fact of nomic that new paradigms will be scammed.  In fact, the Order
Rule have done one thing *very* right IMO;

>From Rule 1796;

     "Furthermore, no Order may act to prevent or hinder its own
      appeal in any way, and any portion of an Order which has this
      effect is void and without force.

>From Rule 1830;

     "No valid Order to Compel may be directed to a Judge, or may
      require the performance of any duty required of Player by the
      virtue of that Player being a Judge.  Any such Order is invalid.
      Any CFJ alleging that a Judge has failed to perform a duty of a
      judicial nature shall be dismissed."

Both of these are very good safeguards.  Otherwise I could render this
situation practically insoluble by Ordering the Judge of this CFJ to
rule True and Order all subsequent Justices to Sustain that Judgement.
I don't believe I would walk through that door if it had been left open.
I'm not attempting to damage the game. However, the presence of these
rules prevent an evil player from placing the game in an impossible
situation.  If given a choice, I would much prefer that the loophole I
walked through remain open than replace it for the potential one
addressed here.

In conclusion, I promise a brief benevolent dictatorship followed by a
loophole fix that will leave a small monument to my reign.

As a wise person once said, "I urge calm."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Evidence:

Rule 1793/0 (Power=1)
Orders

      An Order is a command, executed by a Player and directed to some
      entity requiring that entity to perform exactly one action, or
      to refrain from performing one or more actions.

      An Order may be directed to the holder of an Office or other
      official position in eir capacity as that Office or other
      official position, and in this case if the Office or position
      changes hands before the Order is satisfied, the duty to abide
      by the Order automatically attaches to the new holder of that
      Office or position.

      Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Order, the purpose of which is
      to affect the operation of a prior Order, is as valid as any
      other Order, and is said to be directed at the prior Order it
      affects.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1794/0 (Power=1)
Classes of Orders

      There are four classes of Order: Administrative, Judicial,
      Appellate, and Private.

      A Judicial Order is an Order executed by a Player while acting
      as a Judge.

      An Appellate Order is an Order executed by a Board of Appeals.

      An Administrative Order is an Order executed by the holder of an
      Office or other official position (such as the Speaker or the
      Recordkeepor of a Currency) other than that of a Judge or
      Justice, in the course of performing the duties of that Office
      or position.

      A Private Order is any other sort of Order.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1796/0 (Power=1)
Validity of Orders

      All Orders executed in the manner prescribed by the Rules for
      their class and type are presumed valid and enforceable until
      proven otherwise by CFJ.

      In order to be proven valid by CFJ, the Rules must permit the
      Player who executed the Order in question to execute such an
      Order, that the execution of the Order must have been required
      by or permitted in the circumstances which existed at the time
      it was executed, and that the Order has not been rendered
      invalid by the operation of any other Rule.

      Furthermore, no Order may act to prevent or hinder its own
      appeal in any way, and any portion of an Order which has this
      effect is void and without force.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 116/0 (Power=3)
Permissibility of the Unprohibited

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
      and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
      which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly
      or implicitly permits it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1811/0 (Power=1)
Contempt by Action

      Any entity who, while required by an Order to refrain from
      performing an action, performs the proscribed action while the
      Order is in effect commits the Crime of Contempt by Action, a
      Class C Crime.

      This Rule shall have no application with respect to any Order
      which has been adjudicated to be invalid, and the invalidity of
      the Order is a complete defense to a Criminal accusation made
      under this Rule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1830/0 (Power=1)
No Compulsion of Judges

      No valid Order to Compel may be directed to a Judge, or may
      require the performance of any duty required of Player by the
      virtue of that Player being a Judge.  Any such Order is invalid.
      Any CFJ alleging that a Judge has failed to perform a duty of a
      judicial nature shall be dismissed.

                               CFJ 1095

  The orders issued by Swann in the message to the PF entitled "Here
  we go..." were legal and valid Orders.

======================================================================

Judge:        Murphy

Judgement:

Eligible:     Antimatter, Blob, Chuck, elJefe, Harlequin, Kolja A.,
              Michael, Morendil, Murphy, Oerjan, Steve

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

For the basic valitity of a private transfer order I refer the Judge
to the Reasons and Arguments of the first Coup d'etat CFJ. (qv)

For the validity of the current statement, there are only two rules
that would impose additional restrictions on these Orders.  These are
Rules 1796 and 1830.

The apparently strong Rule 1830;

>       No valid Order to Compel may be directed to a Judge, or may
>       require the performance of any duty required of Player by the
>       virtue of that Player being a Judge.  Any such Order is
>       invalid.  Any CFJ alleging that a Judge has failed to perform
>       a duty of a judicial nature shall be dismissed.

There are a number of flaws here.  One, it is arguable that one can
compel Judical actions as long as the Player comelled is not a Judge
at the time, which none of the Players in the Orders in question were.
Two, the rule makes no refernce to Orders that phrohibit action
(ie. An order not to Judge FALSE) which is the form in which the
Orders in question were cast.  Three, the most devistating flaw, this
rule refers *only* to Orders to Compel-- a specific type of Order
defined in Rule 1509;

>       Upon a judicial finding that a Player has failed to perform a
>       duty required of em by the Rules, the Judge so finding shall
>       execute an Order, requiring that Player to perform that duty
>       as soon as possible.  Such an Order is known as an Order to
>       Compel.
>

It is unquestionably true that the Orders in question were *not*
Orders to Compel as defined in the rules, and therefore 1830 does not
apply at all.

The other rule that applies is Rule 1796;

>       Furthermore, no Order may act to prevent or hinder its own
>       appeal in any way, and any portion of an Order which has this
>       effect is void and without force.

This is much simpler.  None of the Orders in question hinder their
*own* appeal, they only hinder the appeal of other Orders, which is
not forbidden.

Given these facts, I believe that the Judge has no question but to
rule these Orders valid.
======================================================================
Evidence:


Rule 1796/0 (Power=1)
Validity of Orders

      All Orders executed in the manner prescribed by the Rules for
      their class and type are presumed valid and enforceable until
      proven otherwise by CFJ.

      In order to be proven valid by CFJ, the Rules must permit the
      Player who executed the Order in question to execute such an
      Order, that the execution of the Order must have been required
      by or permitted in the circumstances which existed at the time
      it was executed, and that the Order has not been rendered
      invalid by the operation of any other Rule.

      Furthermore, no Order may act to prevent or hinder its own
      appeal in any way, and any portion of an Order which has this
      effect is void and without force.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1509/3 (Power=1)
Orders to Compel

      Upon a judicial finding that a Player has failed to perform a
      duty required of em by the Rules, the Judge so finding shall
      execute an Order, requiring that Player to perform that duty as
      soon as possible.  Such an Order is known as an Order to
      Compel.

      If the duty in question arises because the Player in question
      holds a specific Office or other position of official
      responsibility, the Order shall be directed to that Office or
      position.  If the Player holding that Office fails to perform
      the duty in question as ordered, the Judge shall Order that that
      Player be removed from Office or position.

      If the duty in question arises for a reason not related to the
      Player in question holding a specific Office or official
      position, and that Player fails to perform the duty as ordered,
      the Judge shall amend the Order to require the Speaker to
      perform that duty instead.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1830/0 (Power=1)
No Compulsion of Judges

      No valid Order to Compel may be directed to a Judge, or may
      require the performance of any duty required of Player by the
      virtue of that Player being a Judge.  Any such Order is invalid.
      Any CFJ alleging that a Judge has failed to perform a duty of a
      judicial nature shall be dismissed.

======================================================================
                               CFJ 1096

  An Order, as defined in Rule 1793, and of whatever type, is "a Nomic
  Entity created in accordance with the Rules" in the sense of Rule
  1513 and as such is subject to the limitations set forth in that
  Rule, and in particular that Orders derive coercive power from some
  Rules and that the Rules take precedence over Orders whenever an
  Order conflicts with a Rule.

======================================================================

Judge:        Harlequin

Judgement:

Eligible:     Antimatter, Blob, Chuck, elJefe, General Chaos,
              Harlequin, Kolja A., Michael, Murphy, Oerjan, Steve,
              Swann

Not eligible:
Caller:       Morendil
Barred:       -
Disqualified: Crito (by choice)
On hold:      -

======================================================================

History:
  Called by Morendil, Thu, 21 May 1998 17:23:42 +0100
  Assigned to Harlequin, as of this message

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

I can easily predict that we'll have a hard time dealing with
Swann's recent posts unless we hare a clear notion of how to deal
with Orders as a whole. I propose the above principle, with Orders
being NREs deriving coercive power from, specifically, Rules 1810 and
1811 (although that may be debated, which is why I didn't make the
CFJ dependent on that).

The rationale for that principle is that insofar as the Rules can be
said to "compel" or "prohibit" certain actions which are non-
retractable Moves, the instrument of such coercion is the threat of
being cited for a Crime or Infraction. Thus a Rule which makes a
Crime or Infraction of some action or inaction which is defined in
some body of text other than the Rules themselves can be said to
grant coercive power to that body of text, which brings it under the
purview of Rule 1513.

Thus, an Order prohibiting a Player from Calling for Judgement,
which is what the Orders in "Here we go..." effectively do, is in
conflict with Rule 911, and as such shall be deemed invalid; most
of Swann's other Orders are dealt with similarly, or at the least
innocuuous given that the higher-precedence judicial framework
is preserved by the NRE principle. Conversely, the NRE principle
does not rob other Orders of their effectiveness, and will not
require huge patching up of the Orders Rules to close supposed
loopholes therein.

Agora Nomic
Ambassador's Report

Date of this Report: 14 May 1998

======================================================================
Diplomatic Report

It seems I missed a number of recent mails from the IN list, I
don't know why. 

Apparently, the results of INP365-369 were reported as 

>>
> All of those proposals were submitted by New Rishonnomic:
>
> P365
> FOR  - New Rishonnomic, Ackanomic
> AGAINST - Agora, Micronomic
>
> P366
> FOR- New Rishonnomic, Micronomic
> AGAINST - Agora, Ackanomic
>
> P367
> FOR- New Roshonnomic, Micronomic
> AGAINST - Agora, Ackanomic

> P368

> P369
> FOR - New Rishonnomic, Ackanomic, Micronomic, Internomic
> AGAINST - Agora
>
> P365-367 fail
> P368-369 pass, each giving 2 points to New Rishonnomic
<<

which is in error becasue Agora voted for 366-369. I have sent a
message to that effect to the IN list.

Some new proposals appear to have been distributed, but I have not yet
seen official copies of those. I am a little uncertain what I should do
now,but I'll go be the second hand info I do have.

The following proposals seem to have been distributed, and you can now
vote on them in the Agora referendum on these, for free (no orders of
any kind involved, so you can vote at no cost and no risk of breaking
any tyrant's rules or orders ;):

>>
Submitted by Macronomic


INP 370

Add "unless otherwise specified" to the end of the first sentance of rule 214.

Create a new rule reading as follows:
	A member of internomic, whether voting or not, may join the
Internomic Trade Association by announcing its intent to join to all
Liaisons (for example by posting it on the mailing list) and having the
Customs Officers for at least half of the members of the ITA publicly
support their admission.  If there are fewer than three members of the ITA
then its admission does not require the approval of any Customs Officers.
Regardless of how many members there are in the ITA, the nomic does not
enter the ITA for one week.  During that week the Speaker of Internomic is
expected to read the rules of that nomic to ensure that they are compatible
with the ITA, and may veto the nomic's entrance if they do not.  A nomic
may leave the ITA by announcing its intent to do that to all Liaisons.
	A member of the ITA, through its Customs Officer, may condemn
another member of the ITA.  A comdemnation may be withdrawn by the Customs
Officer.  If at any time two-thirds of the members of the ITA have
condemned a given member of the ITA then Internomic will condemn the nomic
and it will be considered a rouge nomic.  The exact effects of a nomic
being condemned or rouge are left up to each nomic, however all nomics are
discouraged from trading with rouge nomics.
	For the rest of this rule, all nomics refered to will be assumed to
be members of the ITA.  Each nomic will have a Customs Officer.  Unless the
nomic specifies otherwise, the Liaison will serve as the Customs Officer.
All actions which the rest of this rule says may be performed by a nomic
should be performed by the Customs Officer announcing the action to all
Customs Officers.
	A nomic (the sender), via the Customs Officer, may offer to trade
an object or objects to another nomic (the recipient).  The offer may be
conditional on the receipt of an object from the recipient.  The offer must
clearly specify all information necessary to determine which objects are
being traded, and must include the nomic of origin of every object being
traded.  The recipient may either accept or reject the offer.  If the offer
is rejected by the recipient, the offer will be cancelled.  If it is
accepted, then the objects specified will traded from the sender to the
recipient, and any objects the offer was conditional upon will be traded
from the recipient to the owner.  When an object is traded from nomic A to
nomic B the object will cease to owned by anything within A or A itself,
and will be owned by either B or something within B specified by B's rules;
it will be known as being the property of B, and B will be known to possess
it.  Any time before the recipient accepts or rejects the offer, the sender
may cancel it.  A cancelled offer may not be acted on in any way.  The
precise meaning of ownership will very between the members of the ITA,
however when the Speaker checks the nomic's rules e should confirm that the
nomic's definition of ownership is compatible with the literal, implied,
and intended meaning of this rule.  An object may only be offered if the
sender either possesses that object, or is the noo for it.  A conditional
offer may only be accepted if for each conditional object, the recipient
either possesses it or is its noo.
	The nomic which created an object is known as its nomic of origin,
or noo.  Any objects which are to the property of their noo are exported.
All nomics must keep track of all exported objects they are in possession
of, and the noo of each of those objects, and make this information
available to all Liaisons.  If an object is exported, the nomic which
possesses it may not stop possessing it except through an accepted trade,
when it leaves the ITA, or when the object's noo leaves Internomic.  If a
nomic leaves the ITA or Internomic, all exported objects for which it is
the noo will cease to exist in all ITA members, and all exported objects it
posesses are returned to their noo.
	Each nomic retains jurisdiction over all purely internal affairs,
although this jurisdiction may be delegated.  Exported objects may not be
modified in any way, nor may they be traded except through the methods laid
out in this rule.
	Internomic is a member of the ITA, and the Speaker is its Customs
Officer.  Any offer made to Internomic is instantly cancelled.  All Int's
are considered to be exported with Internomic as their noo.  Whenever
Internomic owns an Int, it is destroyed.
	The Speaker of Internomic, either personally or by delegating the
task, is responsible for keeping a log of all transactions.  The log should
include all trades involving an object for which it is the noo, including
the sender, the recipient, and the time.  Nomics are expected to keep logs
of their own and compare their logs with the Internomic log regularly, and
correct any discrepancies to their mutual satisfaction.
	When a nomic joins the ITA, and the ITA has been in existance for
less than two months, then that nomic will posess 10,000 Int's.  This
paragraph will repeal itself two months after this rule is created.
	If a member of the ITA's ruleset or gamestate is not compatible
with the ITA, as determined by a CFJ, then that nomic is immediately
removed from the ITA.  In order to be compatible with the ITA, a nomic must
comply with the following:
	1) It must define ownership.  Only one entity may own a given
object at a time.
	2) If an object is not possessed by the nomic then its ownership
may not be transfered except through an action defined in this rule.
	3) It must not discriminate between objects for which it is the noo
which were once exported and those which never were.

 Game State Updates I

     The moderator of InterNomic shall make public a moderator's
report.  
     This report may be one message, or a series of messages grouped for 
     clarity.  This report may contain any information the moderator 
     feels is useful, but it must contain the following items of 
     information;

        i) The current full text of the InterNomic ruleset.
       ii) The complete list of member nomics.
      iii) The scores of all member nomics.
       iv) The identity of each liaison and their contact addresses.
        v) The scores of all member nomics.
       vi) The voting status of each member nomic.

     This report should be delivered once prior to the 15th of the 
     month, and once after the 15th.


-------------------------------------------

INP 372

submitted by Agora

Game State Updates II


     The moderator shall once every month make public a proposal
     report. This report shall be in a single message and must 
     contain the following items of information;

        i) The text, number, and submitter, of every proposal 
           distributed by the moderator since the prior proposal report.
       ii) The complete voting results for every such proposal whose 
           voting period has concluded.

     This rule does not require record of proposals made before this
     rule was in force.

Rewards for Voting

     If a nomic votes for a proposal made by another nomic and that 
     proposal passes, that nomic gains half a point. If a nomic votes 
     against a proposal made by another nomic and that proposal fails, 
     that nomic gains half a point.

INP 374 
submited by Agora

Proposals by InterNomic

     If a member nomic delivers a proposal to the moderator that is 
     clearly labeled, "a Proposal to be made by InterNomic," then that 
     proposal shall be deemed by the rules of InterNomic to have been
     submitted by InterNomic, not by the nomic that delivered the text 
     to the moderator.


------------------------------------------------------


INP 375
submitted by Agora

Amend Rule 306 by replacing the word "two" with "four".

--------------------------------------------------------

INP 376
submitted by Agora
 
Amend Rule 309 by appending the sentence:

At the end of the voting period for a proposal all nomics that have
cast a vote on this proposal gain one point

--------------------------------------------------------

INP 377
submitted by Agora

Amend Rule 311 by replacing the first sentence with 

A rule change takes effect when the moderator (correctly) reports the
adoption of the proposal containing the rule change in a message to
the Internomic mailing list.

-----------------------------------------


The proposer made the following comments about the above proposals

p365-6 [The following proposals are meant to increase the pace at which IN
is played, and add incentives for nomics to do things.]

p367 [The following proposal is to avoid confusion about the current state
of the rules.]

<<

I think the proposal numbers in Uri's version of the comments are
scrambled; they should refer to INP375-6 resp. INP377.

As I haven't yet seen the message distributing these proposals I don't
know exactly when our referendum on them will end. Probably it's one
week from now. However, I believe that the voring period only depends
on the time of distribution, but nor on whether I know that time now
and include it in this message. If the voting period is less than one
week, I'll let you know as soon as I find out.

I am not sure whether INP373-4 were actually submitted by us - I do
remember INP371-2 and 375-8 (I made the latter three myself). Could
whoever submitted INP371-4 please tell me?

I saw two legal responses to the Counter-Revolution, this, I believe, 
is the slicker of the two. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
I hereby _amend_ (an action forbidden me by no order) the Orders in
my message entitled "I didn't want to do this" as follows;

In each Order, after the first, the text that reads;
        "to refrain from granting any and all Motions to stay or
vacate          the orders in the Coup d'etat message, nor shall e grant
any          motions to punish Swann for such Orders. E is also ordered
to          refrain from issuing such Orders under eir own authority."

is changed to read;
        "to refrain from granting any and all Motions to stay, vacate
or          amend Orders issued by Player Swann, nor shall e grant
any          motions to punish Swann for such Orders. Nor shall e issue
such          Motions.  Nor shall e Order the stay, vacation or
amendment of          any Orders made by Player Swann."

In the case of the first such order, it is amended to read as follows;

        "I hereby Order Player Antimater, to refrain from granting
any           and all Motions to stay, vacate or amend Orders issued
by               Player Swann.  Nor shall e grant any motions to punish
Swann            for such Orders.  Nor shall e issue such Motions.  Nor
shall e          Order the stay, vacation or amendment of any Orders
made by             Player Swann. E must refrain from issuing any
Administrative,           Judicial, Appellate or Private Order that is
of a type that is          not explicitly defined in the Rules.  Nor
shall e issue any             such Order except in such curcumstances
where Rules explicitly          permit em to issue such an Order. If e
has made an Order that           does not conform to these criteria, e
must vacate it within 72          hours."


----------------------------------------------------------------------
I hereby _amend_ (an action forbidden me by no order) the Orders in
my message entitled "Coup d'etat" as follows;

In each Order after the first, all instances of the (prior amended) text
reading;
       "issuing any Administrative, Judicial, Appellate or Private
        Order that is of a type that is not explicitly defined in the
        Rules.  Nor shall e issue any such Order except in such
        curcumstances where Rules explicitly permit em to issue such an
        Order."

Is replaced with the following text;
       "issuing any Administrative, Judicial, Appellate or Private
        Order that is of a type that is not explicitly defined in the
        Rules.  Nor shall e issue any such Order except in such
        curcumstances where Rules explicitly permit em to issue such an
        Order. If e has made an Order that does not conform to these
        criteria, e must vacate it."

The first such Order is amended to read as follows;

       "I hereby Order Player Macross, to refrain from granting any and 
        all Motions to stay, vacate or amend Orders issued by
Player            Swann.  Nor shall e grant any Motions to punish Swann
for such          Orders.  Nor shall e issue such Motions.  Nor shall e
Order the         stay, vacation or amendment of any Orders made by
Player Swann.         E must refrain from issuing any Administrative,
Judicial,               Appellate or Private Order that is of a type
that is not                explicitly defined in the Rules.  Nor shall e
issue any such            Order except in such curcumstances where Rules
explicitly permit         em to issue such an Order. If e has made an
Order that does not         conform to these criteria, e must vacate it
within 72 hours."


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
I hereby vacate all orders in my message entitled "Here we go..." as
required by the temporarily sucessful Counter-revolution.

Since 1793 refers to ordering "entities," not Players...

I hereby submit a copy of the following Order to each and every present
and future recipient of the Public Forum who is not currently a Player
in Agora. (Which by definition incudes all future new Players.  I will
publish this weekly to insure the affected entities will recieve it.)

I hereby command you, the above mentioned entity, to-- should you
become a Player in Agora-- to refrain from the following acts upon
becoming a Player;
         You are to refrain from granting any and all Motions to stay, 
         vacate or amend Orders issued by Player Swann.  Nor shall you
         grant any motions to punish Swann for such Orders.  Nor
         shall you issue such Motions.  Nor shall you Order the stay,
         vacation or amendment of any Orders made by Player Swann. 
         you must refrain from issuing any Administrative, Judicial,

NOTE:
This is not a new set of amendments, the prior ones were effective (the
only difference is whitespace) this is an informational copy that is
less difficult to read.


I saw two legal responses to the Counter-Revolution, this, I believe, 
is the slicker of the two. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
I hereby _amend_ (an action forbidden me by no order) the Orders in
my message entitled "I didn't want to do this" as follows;

In each Order, after the first, the text that reads;
        "to refrain from granting any and all Motions to stay or vacate
         the orders in the Coup d'etat message, nor shall e grant any
         motions to punish Swann for such Orders. E is also ordered
         to refrain from issuing such Orders under eir own authority."

is changed to read;
        "to refrain from granting any and all Motions to stay, vacate
         or amend Orders issued by Player Swann, nor shall e grant
         any motions to punish Swann for such Orders. Nor shall e issue
         such Motions.  Nor shall e Order the stay, vacation or
         amendment of any Orders made by Player Swann."

In the case of the first such order, it is amended to read as follows;

        "I hereby Order Player Antimater, to refrain from granting
         any and all Motions to stay, vacate or amend Orders issued
         by Player Swann.  Nor shall e grant any motions to punish
         Swann for such Orders.  Nor shall e issue such Motions.  Nor
         shall e Order the stay, vacation or amendment of any Orders
         made by Player Swann. E must refrain from issuing any
         Administrative, Judicial, Appellate or Private Order that is
         of a type that is not explicitly defined in the Rules.  Nor
         shall e issue any such Order except in such curcumstances
         where Rules explicitly permit em to issue such an Order. If e
         has made an Order that does not conform to these criteria, e
         must vacate it within 72 hours."


----------------------------------------------------------------------
I hereby _amend_ (an action forbidden me by no order) the Orders in
my message entitled "Coup d'etat" as follows;

In each Order after the first, all instances of the (prior amended) text
reading;
       "issuing any Administrative, Judicial, Appellate or Private
        Order that is of a type that is not explicitly defined in the
        Rules.  Nor shall e issue any such Order except in such
        curcumstances where Rules explicitly permit em to issue such an
        Order."

Is replaced with the following text;
       "issuing any Administrative, Judicial, Appellate or Private
        Order that is of a type that is not explicitly defined in the
        Rules.  Nor shall e issue any such Order except in such
        curcumstances where Rules explicitly permit em to issue such an
        Order. If e has made an Order that does not conform to these
        criteria, e must vacate it."

The first such Order is amended to read as follows;

       "I hereby Order Player Macross, to refrain from granting any and 
        all Motions to stay, vacate or amend Orders issued by
        Player Swann.  Nor shall e grant any Motions to punish Swann
        for such Orders.  Nor shall e issue such Motions.  Nor shall e
        Order the stay, vacation or amendment of any Orders made by 
        Player Swann. E must refrain from issuing any Administrative,
        Judicial, Appellate or Private Order that is of a type
        that is not explicitly defined in the Rules.  Nor shall e
        issue any such Order except in such curcumstances where Rules
        explicitly permit em to issue such an Order. If e has made an
        Order that does not conform to these criteria, e must vacate it
        within 72 hours."


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
I hereby vacate all orders in my message entitled "Here we go..." as
required by the temporarily sucessful Counter-revolution.

{Comment: This is what I should have done, instead of that unfortunate
          message "No New Player Tyranny."  This is an explicit
          amendment that I believe is legal under the Order Rules, which 
          state that Orders are directed at entities, not Players.}

Orders in the message "Here we go..." which would be CDO-027 to CDO-053
have all been vacated and are no longer in force.

{Comment: This is what I should have done, instead of that unfortunate
          message "No New Player Tyranny."  This is an explicit
          amendment that I believe is legal under the Order Rules, which 
          state that Orders are directed at entities, not Players.}

Orders in the message "Here we go..." which would be CDO-027 to CDO-053
have all been vacated and are no longer in force.

I believe that this order is invalid.  Rule 1793/0 reads in part:

      An Order is a command, executed by a Player and directed to some
      entity requiring that entity to perform exactly one action, or
      to refrain from performing one or more actions.

You have here amended an order to require me to take an action and
to refrain from taking actions.  However an order may only do one or
the other, not both.  Thus I believe this order is by definition not
an Order at all.


I issue the order below, only if it is legal for me to do:

I hereby Order and command Player Swann to refrain from using words
       that are not spelled the same backwards as forwards when
       issuing any Administrative, Judicial, Appellate or Private
       Orders unless the issuing of those Orders is explicitly
       required of 'em by the Rules or by an Order issued by Player
       Macross.


This should effectively hold off the dictator.

-Macross.
