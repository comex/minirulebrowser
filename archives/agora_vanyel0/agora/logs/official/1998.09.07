Given the absence of more recent data for the DJIA's behaviour, I
thank Steve for his expert witness provision of information, and
naturally agree that my attempt to provide a verifiable random value
was flawed.

I will therefore use the supposedly acceptable method of using my
computer's built-in random number generator.  This generator's next
value is of course is entirely determined by the previous value in the
sequence, but is presumably equivalent in this respect to the
dice-server in Denmark (now defunct it seems) that a past CFJ
established to be adequate.  (The truly suspicious among you might
find it amusing that I judged the CFJ in question.)

There is an outstanding CFJ on another issue here (that of whether or
not I should be computing 10/17 or 10/16), but I believe 10/17 is
correct, and will be continuing with it.  So, here we go: 

I (or rather my computer :-) rolled a 9.  (From a possible range of
0-16.)

So, the revolt in fact succeeded!

Well done Robespierre Blob!

Consequences of this momentous circumstance to follow.

Michael.

Accountor Lee became the Electee for his Office on 30 August, and was
Electee at midnight this last Sunday.  He had also at this time failed
to produce an Accountor's report for three weeks in a row.  However,
he wasn't Electee for all of those weeks. 

Does Rule 1644 mean that he has committed Dereliction of Duty?  (DoD
is a Class B Crime: 10 Blots and 10 VTs.)  I am authorised to detect
and report this Infraction, but not seemingly required to do so.  

Michael.

Indeed. 

I hereby vacate RVTPO577, which paid Crito a salary for the week
ending the 16th, when in fact Blob had come into office on the 13th.
Blob doesn't get a salary for that week though as he hadn't been in
Office for five days or more. 

I also vacate RVTPO603, which paid Crito a salary for the week ending
the 23rd.  I also order the Bank to pay Blob 0.6 VTs (RVTPO654) as his
Promotor's salary for that week.  I finally order the vacation of
RVTPO612, which was Blob's unemployment benefit for that week.

I also vacate RVTPO628, which paid Crito a salary for the week ending
the 30th.  I also order the Bank to pay Blob 0.6 VTs (RVTPO655) as his
Promotor's salary for that week.  I finally order the vacation of
RVTPO637, which was Blob's unemployment benefit for that week. 

Phew!

I quite understand this and am doing my best to prepare the report.  I
want to give the next Accountor  better start than i had.

Proposal 3787  (Steve) AI = 1
Get Rid of 4 Offices

[Comment: this Proposal will delete the Offices of Scorekeepor, 
Archivist, Wizard, and Commander-in-Chief. Plots and the Cartographor
remain untouched.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rules 1775 (Points and Scoring), 1776 (the
Scorekeepor), 1782 (Changing a Player's Score), 1783 (Ordering Changes
in a Player's Score), 1784 (The Omnibus Scoring Rule), 1790 (Buying
points), 1777 (Winning Scores), 1778 (Initiating an Endgame Procedure),
1779 (Challenging an Endgame Procedure), 1780 (Losing Eligibility to
Win) and 1781 (Termination of the Endgame Procedure) all be repealed.

Be it further resolved that Rules 1657 (The Archivist) and 417 (Duties of
the Archivist) be repealed.

Be it further resolved that R1370 (How To Get A Degree) be amended by
replacing in it the text which currently reads:

      The Archivist shall retain a copy of each Thesis posted in this
      manner.

with text which reads: 

      The Rulekeepor shall retain a copy of each Thesis posted in this
      manner.

Be it further resolved that R786 (Rule of Succession for Speaker or
Speaker-Elect) be amended by deleting from it the line which reads:
"the Archivist".

Be it further resolved that Rules 1543 (Style Points), 1543 (The
Wizard) and 1682 (Boors) all be repealed.

Be it further resolved that R1720 (The Militia) be repealed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal 3788 (Steve) AI = 1
Lower the MUQ of VTs

[Comment: the new 5% commission which the Assessor takes out of votes
spent on Proposals means awkward rounding problems unless we lower the
MUQ of VTs. I could propose to lower it to 0.05, but we might as well go
the whole way and lower it to 0.01.]

Be it hereby resolved that R1696 (Voting Tokens) be amended by replacing
the text in it which currently reads:

      The MUQ of VTs is 0.1.

with text which reads:

      The MUQ of VTs is 0.01.
