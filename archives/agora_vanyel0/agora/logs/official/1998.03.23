The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of
a VOC directive was the report published in the PF on 1996/08/13
(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

AFAIK, no Herald's Report has ever been successfully ratified.

Indelible Proposal voting

[Comment: indelible voting has a number of advantages: it's legislatively
simpler (no need to worry about retracted or changed votes), it
encourages VT spending since Players can't retract votes in excess
of those needed to achieve the result they desire, and it provides a
negotiation-friendly environment, since Players can publically keep
promises and/or signal that they are not available to be negotiated
with by voting.]

Be it therefore resolved that R683 have its Title changed to
"Voting on Proposals" and that it be amended to read:

      A Voting Entity votes upon a Proposal when, during the Voting
      Period of that Proposal, e informs the Assessor of the vote or
      votes e is casting upon that Proposal, provided that e is
      authorized to cast those votes on that Proposal. Once cast, a
      vote cannot be changed or cancelled by the Voting Entity which
      cast it, although it may be cancelled as other Rules require.

      A vote upon a Proposal must be one of FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN
      (or an obvious synonym of one of these).  Something which is not
      one of these is not a vote upon a Proposal.

      A vote cast by a Voting Entity which does not have an Executor
      is cast at a time and in a manner specified in other Rules.

      This Rule in no way authorizes any entity to cast votes upon
      Proposals.

Be it further resolved that Rule 1442 have its Title changed to
"The Cost of Voting" and that it be amended to read:

      As soon as possible after the end of the Voting Period of a
      given Proposal, the Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity a
      number of Voting Tokens equal to the votes cast on that
      Proposal by that entity.

[Comment: together these amendments also eliminate some overlap between
the current versions of these Rules. They do take in to account the
effect of Omnibus Reform, assuming that passes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Swann) AI = 1
A minor Score Fix

Rule 1783 is amended by replacing the text;
", and specifying the magnitude of that change."

with the text;
", the magnitude of the change, and whether that change is
 a gain or a loss."

{Comment: Fixes the bug which allows a Score change to be ordered
          by saying a Player's Score changes by X points, w/o saying
          if X is positive or negative.}

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Chuck) AI = 5
CounterScam the Veto Scam, Part II

The Rule entitled "A Monument to the Threat" is hereby repealed.

If Proposal 3710 has been adopted, then a Rule, entitled "A Win for
Non-Threat" is hereby created, with the following text:

      All Players who did not win the game upon the creation of
      the Rule entitled "A Win for Threat" win the game upon creation
      of this Rule.  This takes precedence over Rules that would
      prevent any of them from winning the game at that time.

      Any Threat Trombones in existence are hereby destroyed.

      All Players who did not win the game upon the creation of
      the Rule entitled "A Win for Threat" are granted the Patent
      Title "Threat Trombone Mute".

      Chuck is granted the Patent Title "CounterScamster".

      This Rule shall repeal itself at 12:00 GMT on 15 April 1998.

[Comment: A Win for everyone might seem a little extreme, but
if everyone else doesn't get a reward at least that given
to certain people by the Veto Scam, why not just vote down
the Veto Scam?

I'd like to limit the win and PT to those voting FOR Part I,
but I'm afraid that would run afoul of R1003.]

Rule 955 is amended by appending a paragraph reading

      A Proposal may not have its Voting Index set except
      as described in this Rule.  A Proposal may not be adopted
      (synonymous with the Proposal passing) except as described
      in this Rule.

[Comment: Close this loophole.]

If Proposal 3710 has been adopted, then the Rule whose text
begins, "No instrument can create, or empower another entity to create,"
has its Power set to 3, and is amended to read as follows; if
Proposal 3710 has not been adopted, then a Rule is created with Power=3
and text as follows:

      Except as described in this Rule, no entity can set the Power
      of another entity to exceed the Power of the entity causing
      the Power to be so set.  A Rule may set the Power of an adopted
      Proposal, even exceeding the Power of the Rule, so long as the
      Power of the adopted Proposal does not exceed the Voting Index
      of that Proposal.

      No entity may destroy or repeal an entity with Power greater
      than its own.

[Comment: much shorter and more effective than Swann/Threat's
version.  Theirs has several problems.  First, does not
prevent an intrument from *changing* the Power of another.
Second, sets a Proposal's Power *before* it is adopted.
(Just look at what I did here with such a loophole!  Even
though TGOVSP seems to guard against that by not allowing
a Proposal to "take effect" until it's adopted, it's
still a dangerous precedent, IMO.)  R594 sets the Power of
a Proposal once it's adopted, anyway.  Also, their "Proposals
are explicitly exempt from this provision" is unclear--are
Proposals exempt as the creating entity, the created entity,
or both?  They have to throw in an extra prohibition on
Proposals later to make up for their ambiguity.  Finally, got
rid of the final paragraph, setting the default Power of
instruments to 1, as I'm not fond of having instruments
other than Proposals and Rules anyway, and I don't want to
encourage it.]

OFF:  New Proposals: 3718 - 3719

There are two new proposals distributed as of this report.  The Voting Period
on these Proposals commences as of this message and will end on Thursday, April
2.

======================================================================

S = Silly

   3718 Steve          1 Indelible Proposal voting 
   3719 Swann          1 A minor Score Fix 

======================================================================
Proposal 3718 (Steve) AI = 1
Indelible Proposal voting

[Comment: indelible voting has a number of advantages: it's legislatively
simpler (no need to worry about retracted or changed votes), it
encourages VT spending since Players can't retract votes in excess
of those needed to achieve the result they desire, and it provides a
negotiation-friendly environment, since Players can publically keep
promises and/or signal that they are not available to be negotiated
with by voting.]

Be it therefore resolved that R683 have its Title changed to
"Voting on Proposals" and that it be amended to read:

      A Voting Entity votes upon a Proposal when, during the Voting
      Period of that Proposal, e informs the Assessor of the vote or
      votes e is casting upon that Proposal, provided that e is
      authorized to cast those votes on that Proposal. Once cast, a
      vote cannot be changed or cancelled by the Voting Entity which
      cast it, although it may be cancelled as other Rules require.

      A vote upon a Proposal must be one of FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN
      (or an obvious synonym of one of these).  Something which is not
      one of these is not a vote upon a Proposal.

      A vote cast by a Voting Entity which does not have an Executor
      is cast at a time and in a manner specified in other Rules.

      This Rule in no way authorizes any entity to cast votes upon
      Proposals.

Be it further resolved that Rule 1442 have its Title changed to
"The Cost of Voting" and that it be amended to read:

      As soon as possible after the end of the Voting Period of a
      given Proposal, the Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity a
      number of Voting Tokens equal to the votes cast on that
      Proposal by that entity.

[Comment: together these amendments also eliminate some overlap between
the current versions of these Rules. They do take in to account the
effect of Omnibus Reform, assuming that passes.

======================================================================
Proposal 3719 (Swann) AI = 1

Rule 1783 is amended by replacing the text;
", and specifying the magnitude of that change."

with the text;
", the magnitude of the change, and whether that change is
 a gain or a loss."

{Comment: Fixes the bug which allows a Score change to be ordered
          by saying a Player's Score changes by X points, w/o saying
          if X is positive or negative.}
