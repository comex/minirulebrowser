New Proposals: 3808 - 3809

There are two new proposals distributed as of this report. The Voting Period
on these Proposals commences as of this message and will end on Saturday,
December 5. Voting on these proposals will cost 0 VTs.

======================================================================
D = Disinterested
S = Sane
E = Emergency
I = Insane
U = Urgent

   3808 Kolja          1 Monthly voting bills
   3809 Gen Chaos      1 Ten Days is Too Long

======================================================================
Proposal 3808 (Kolja) AI = 1
Monthly Voting bills

Amend R1442 to read:

      Every vote cast on a proposal has a voting cost, equal to 
      the Voting Tariff at the time the proposal was distributed. 
      The voting cost of a particular vote is unbilled if it has 
      not been billed yet.

      As soon as possible after the beginning of each month, the 
      Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity a number of Voting 
      Tokens equal to the overall unbilled voting cost of all votes
      cast on Proposals by that entity in the past month. 

Amend R1449 by replacing the string "0.5" with "0.7".

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal 3809 (Gen Chaos) AI = 1
Ten Days is Too Long

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 693 be amended, by replacing "ten
days "with "seven days".
