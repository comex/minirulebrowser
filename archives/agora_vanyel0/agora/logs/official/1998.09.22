I hereby order the Bank to pay Blob 1 VT as his judicial salary.

======================================================================
                               CFJ 1107

 A Recordkeepor is not required to abide by a valid Transfer Order
 under the condition that this transfer "would result in an entity
 possessing a negative quantity of Currency" (R1817). However, as soon
 as this condition ceases to be true, the Transfer Order in question
 must be obeyed.

======================================================================

Judge:        Blob

Judgement:    FALSE

Eligible:     Antimatter, Blob, Chuck, General Chaos, Harlequin,
              Macross, Michael, Morendil, Murphy, Proglet, Steve

Not eligible:
Caller:       Kolja A.
Barred:       Crito, Lee
Disqualified: -
On hold:      elJefe, Oerjan

======================================================================

History:
  Called by Kolja A.:     Tue, 15 Sep 1998 14:17:40 +0200
  Assigned to Blob:       Wed, 16 Sep 1998 10:16:10 +0100
  Judged FALSE by Blob:   Tue, 22 Sep 1998 13:45:37 +1000 

======================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

While R1817 does not explicitly state when this condition is to be
checked, it also says nothing about any change in a TO's status if
this condition is true at some time or other.

Therefore, as soon as the payor of the TO has sufficient funds to pay
the TO, the situation is the same as in the standard case: there is a
valid TO around, and there is no reason why the recordkeepor shouldn't
be allowed and required to execute the TO.

As an aside, I wonder whether there is anything that would stop a
recordkeepor to make a transfer that leaves a player with a negative
amount of currency? R1817 only says that in this case the recordkeepor
is "not required to" make the transfer

======================================================================

Judge's Arguments:

R1817 says that the Recordkeepor is not required to abide by a TO which
would result in an entity posessing a negative quantity of Currency. It
also says that Transfers shall be noted in the order in which they are
receieved. So even if the condition was to become true at a later date,
the Recordkeepor is forbidden to obey it, if any later transfer had
already been noted.

H. Accountor and Promotor, this report dontains some POs for you.

Agora Nomic
Ambassador's Report

Date of this Report: 22 Sep 1998

======================================================================
Diplomatic Report

I'm not sure how to define the times when my ASAP duties for reporting
INP results start, becasue Uri has a somewhat tentative style to
announce results (he always adds that he may have forgotten some votes
and is waiting for clarifications and corrections, which sometimes do
happen). 

Anyway, proposals 378-380 have been announced as adopted, and this
results was challenged, but unsuccessfully (some late votes had been
ignored, correctly).

I won't list these proposals again, they concerned 

a missing status for nomics that haven't done anything for 30 days
(INP378) to disqualify them from judgine

the removal of Bluesmobile Nomic at their request

a simple procedure for reassigning SFJs if the original judge
defaults.

I believe that all these proposals were originally made by me (please
correct me if I'm wrong), so I hereby issue the following POs:

5 VTs from the bank to Kolja A. as an award for the adopted INP378
5 VTs from the bank to Kolja A. as an award for the adopted INP379
5 VTs from the bank to Kolja A. as an award for the adopted INP380
2 P-notes from the bank to Kolja A. as an award for the adopted INP378
2 P-notes from the bank to Kolja A. as an award for the adopted INP379
2 P-notes from the bank to Kolja A. as an award for the adopted INP380


It is also my pleasure to announce that the following players have
voted on INP383:

Steve, Michael, Kolja A., Chuck, lee, Blob, Crito and Murphy (all
voting for). 

I can therefore vote for this, and hope that the recent bunch of
adopted proposals by us puts us ahead of Acka in the scoring list of
IN. Sorry that there are no individual Agora score rewards for voting
on INP proposals anymore, but at least you're helping Agora to inch
closer to winning IN.
