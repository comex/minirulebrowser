Proposal  (Steve) AI = 1
Permanent Electioneering

[Comment: I think the temporary ban on Electioneering has been a success,
and I'd like to see it made permanent. Permitting the Assessor to use the
information in eir possession as a resource gives the Office much more
interest and scope for creative play.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rules 452 and 1652 be repealed.

  Published, as of this message

======================================================================

Judgement: TRUE

Reasons and arguments:

I Judge this statement to be TRUE.  As the caller points out, the
wording in R1859 is clear and unambiguous regarding the manner in
which a vote may be cast, and the first clause is clearly a claim of
precedence (without, I should note, using the explicit phrase "This
rule takes precedence over...").

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

>From Rule 1859:
      Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
      any votes, or the declaration of Presence, by Voting Entities
      on Proposals, Elections or Referenda, may only be achieved by
      sending a message to the Vote Collector of the Proposal,
      Election, or Referendum only. (Players are, however, permitted
      to send or copy such messages to themselves.)

This clearly prevents a message to the Public Forum from effecting a
Vote.
