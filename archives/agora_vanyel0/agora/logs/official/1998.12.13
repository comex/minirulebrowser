  Judgement published:                     as of this message

==========================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

When P3809 took effect, it set the Voting Period to seven days.
Proposals 3810-3812 were distributed on Mon, 30 Nov 1998 at 07:29:29
(GMT).

Now there are, as far as I can see, three possible hypotheses as to when
the Voting Period on these proposals ends:

     i) Seven days after they were Proposed,
        at 07:29:29 (GMT) on Monday, December 7.

    ii) Ten days after they were Proposed,
        at 07:29:29 (GMT) on Thursday, December 10.

   iii) At the time P3809 took effect,
        at 07:55:39 (GMT) on Monday, December 7.

Now I don't have any particular opinion as to which of these is true,
but I note that it doesn't make much practical difference whether it is
(i) or (iii), as no votes were cast during this period. The times
mentioned in the Statement are the times of the last recorded

==========================================================================
Judge's Arguments:

I rule true.

I have read the arguments. i think votes that were legal when cast
counted.  I don't buy that the VP was changed for all past proposals
were changed.
