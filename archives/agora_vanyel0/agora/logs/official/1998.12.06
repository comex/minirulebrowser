Repeal-O-Matic Rule selection for Dec 07 1998
---------------------------------------------
There are 313 rules in the latest short logical ruleset.
Selecting five at random gives:

 81 : Rule 1865 (A Duty to Propose)
204 : Rule 1691 (Category of New Rules)
 25 : Rule 1513 (Authority of Non-Rule Entities)
195 : Rule 1816 (No Double Jeopardy for Crimes)
180 : Rule 1447 (Final Judgement upon Appeal)

There was some disagreement as to whether or not A Duty to Propose
was a good idea at the time it was proposed. Let's see whether the
populace still support it...

On behalf of the Repeal-O-Matic, I propose:

PROPOSAL: Repeal Rule 1865 (A Duty to Propose)
      This Proposal shall have an AI = 1
    1865  Rule  is hereby Repealed.
