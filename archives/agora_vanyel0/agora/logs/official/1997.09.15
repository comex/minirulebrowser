                               CFJ <n>

Rule 789 should be interpreted such that a document purporting to be
a Call for Judgement alleging that a Rule should be interpreted in a
certain way, but which does not include a list of Relevant Rules
assembled by the Caller, which includes the Rule being interpreted, is
not in fact a CFJ, and that therefore neither the Clerk of the Courts
nor any other Player incur any obligations regarding it.

======================================================================

Relevant Rules: 789, 991

======================================================================
(Caller's) Arguments:
I don't really have particularly strong feelings about this one way
or the other, but it seems we need a decision, and this will set a
precedent we can use in future cases, should any such arise. I have
a mild tendency to think that the Statement is TRUE, for reasons which
I outline below.

There are reasonable arguments on both sides, which the Judge must
choose between. These turn on how the word 'must' in R789 should be
interpreted:

      A CFJ alleging a Rule should be interpreted in a certain way
      must be accompanied by a list of relevant Rules, assembled by
      the Caller, which includes the Rule being interpreted.

On the one hand, we could interpret this 'must' as imposing an obligation
on a Caller to include a list of Relevant Rules, an obligation which, if
the Caller fails to meet it, results in the Caller having violated R789.
On this reading, there is no reason to think that the legality of the CFJ
is brought into question by the Caller's having violated R789, and so the
Statement would be FALSE.

On the other hand, we could interpret this 'must' as imposing a condition
on what it takes to be a CFJ. On this reading, it is partially definitive
of being a CFJ (of the relevant kind) that it be accompanied by a list
of Relevant Rules. This would bring R789 into conflict with R991, which
offers an incompatible definition:

      Any document submitted to the Clerk of the Courts and which is
      clearly marked as a Call for Judgement is a Call for Judgement.

Since R789 wins this conflict by virtue of its lower Number, we arrive
at the conclusion that the Statement is TRUE.

Two possible interpretations, both plausible. Is there any reason to
favour one over the other? I think there is such a reason: the
precise wording of R789, which states that "A CFJ...must...", and not
"The Caller of a CFJ...must...". I think this gives us a reason to
regard to R789 more plausibly as imposing a condition on what it
takes to be a CFJ than as imposing a requirement on the Caller. It
may not be a terribly powerful reason for preferring the second
interpretation to the first, but in the absence of other compelling
reasons to make one judgement rather than the other, it may prove
decisive. At any rate, I offer it to the Judge for eir consideration.

Requested Injunction:

I request that the Judge issue an Injunction requiring the Rulekeepor
to annotate R789 with the Statement, as e is permitted to do by R789.
[Maybe at last I'll get my self-referential annotation of R789!]

It was only after assigning CFJ 942 that I found that ChrisM had joined
the ranks of players. As has been established by Game Custom, I will have
fulfilled my duties as to randomness if I now stick with my old Assignment
with chance 18/19, and give it to ChrisM with chance 1/19.

To do so I will use the following procedure:
I will throw a die. If it comes up 1, 2, or 3, CFJ 942 stays assigned
to General Chaos. If it comes up 4, I will throw again, and if this
time I see a 1 coming up, the CFJ will be assigned to ChrisM. If I throw 
a 5 or a 6, or if I throw a 4 and not a 1 in second throw, I will repeat
the procedure. Simple probability theory shows us that this will indeed
lead to the desired division of chances.

I throw... 4. Second throw... 1! Unbelievable... So CFJ 942 is now assigned
to ChrisM. Here is the whole CFJ again:

Attention Rulekeepor! This Judgement contains and Injunction to
annotate a Rule!

======================================================================
                               CFJ 940

Rule 1596 should be interpreted so that a message purporting to
be a Payment Order must, in order to satisfy that Rule's requirements
and qualify as a legal Payment Order, explicitly and unambiguously
state that the purported Payor is ordered to effect a payment as
a consequence of that message, e.g. by stating "Player X is commanded
to pay Y", the mere mention of an amount of a Currency, the name or
names of the Payor and Payee, or a reference to some Rule or some
situation that requires a Payment Order to be executed being
insufficient for a message not containing such a command or entreaty
to qualify as a Payment Order.

======================================================================

Judge:       Chuck

Judgement:   TRUE

Eligible:    Andre, Antimatter, Blob, Calabresi, Chuck, Crito, Elde,
             elJefe, General Chaos, Harlequin, Kolja A., Michael,

Injunction:  The Rulekeepor is to annotate Rule 1596 with the
	     statement and list of relevant Rules of this CFJ.

  Judged TRUE by Chuck, 14 Sep 1997, 16:11 CDT

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

I believe this follows from Rule 1596's definition of a Payment Order
as "an order requiring an entity to" perform some action, and that no
message not framed as a command is a legal Payment Order.

Note that the claim that a particular message _is_ a Payment Order
is by that reasoning sufficient to satisfy Rule 1596's requirement.

I kindly request that the Judge of the CFJ enjoin the Rulekeepor to
annotate R1596 with the above statement and the list of relevant
Rules which follows : 1596.

======================================================================\

Decision and Reasoning Judge:

I judge this statement to be TRUE.

Injunction:
I hereby enjoin the Rulekeepor to annotate Rule 1596
with the statement and list of relevant Rules of this CFJ.

Reasons and Arguments:
I agree with the Caller's arguments.

                               CFJ 938

"Rule 1513 should be interpreted such that, if a body of text has been
 read by a Player, then it shall not lack the power to require that
 Player to perform or not perform an action solely because the Rules
 fail to require that it be made available to that Player."

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Rule 1513 ends with this text:

     Especially, no body of text is permitted to require Players to
     perform or not perform any actions unless said body of text has
     previously been made available to that Player.

This says "Text T can bind Player P only if P has read T"; it does not
say "Text T can bind Player P only if the Rules require that P can
receive a copy of T".

======================================================================

Decision and Reasoning Judge:

I Judge the Statement TRUE. Clearly any body of text that a Player has
read has been made available to that Player, under any definition of
what it means to be 'made available'. I don't necessarily accept the
suggestion made by the Caller that having been read by the Player is
a necessary condition for a text to have been made available to that
Player, but it certainly is sufficient.

                               CFJ 939


The provision in R1504 which states that:

      Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their
      legal report, and the Player making the report of the Infraction
      shall execute whatever Payment Order(s) are required to apply
      the penalty specified for that Infraction. 

should be interpreted such that penalties for Infractions are applied
immediately upon the legal report of the *penalties*, not the legal
report of the Infractions.

(Caller's) Arguments:

I reproduce as my argument the one I gave for the same conclusion
in my Judgement of CFJ 937:

"It's worth commenting at this point on an ambiguity in R1504: it's
not clear whether the report of the Infraction and the report of the
gain in Blots have to be made in the same message, or whether the
report of gain in Blots can follow the report of the Infraction by up
to seven days. The first sentence [sic] of R1504 states that
"Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their legal
report". But the legal report of what: the penalties or the
infractions? If infractions is meant, R1504 is somewhat in tension
with itself, since it immediately goes on to imply (along with other
Rules, eg R1599) that the application of the penalty can be later
than the report of the Infraction. So I read R1504 as saying that
penalties for Infractions are applied at the time the penalty is
reported, which can be later than the time the Infraction is reported."

Requested Injunction:

I request that the Judge of the CFJ issue an Injunction requesting
the Rulekeepor to annotate R1504 with the statement and the list
of relevant Rules below, as e is permitted to do by R789.

Relevant Rules: 1504, 1599

Appeals decisions

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Justice elJefe's decision: SUSTAIN

>                               CFJ 930

> "No Payment Orders have thus far been successfully executed, for the
>  reason that none exist."

Judge Chuck relied on the reasoning of CFJ 929:

> However, at the time of the CFJ, only one Transfer Order could have
> been submitted, namely the Chancellor's transfer of 9 Indulgences
> from the Bank to Elde. At that time the Mint (which was Mintor of
> Indulgences) no longer had Mint Authority due to the effects of
> Proposal 3533. Thus Indulgences ceased to exist as a Currency by
> Rule 1579, and so the Chancellor's posting, not referring to any
> Currency, was not a Transfer Order.

The only point in dispute is whether Indulgences continued to exist as
a currency after the adoption of Proposal 3533.  If they did then the
reasoning in the quoted paragraph of CFJ 929 is correct and the
judgement of TRUE stands.  If not then the judgement in both CFJs
should be FALSE, since the Misanthropists' currencies failed to
confuse itself with Payment Orders or Transfer Orders defined in the
Rules.

Quoting from Rule 1579: "If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist,
or ceases to have the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that
Currency are destroyed, and that Currency ceases to exist."  There is
unchallenged evidence that the old Mintor for Indulgences ceased to
exist, and that no new Mintor was designated.  Therefore unless this
conflicts with some higher-power Rule, it must be applied.

Rule 1435 begins "Indulgences are a Currency."  One possible
interpretation is that Indulgences were destroyed and ceased to exist
at a given instant; but then immediately after that R1435
re-established Indulgences as a Currency without a Mintor, which then
is immune to R1579 since it has no Mintor which can either cease
existing or lose Mint authority. (*)

This has several things wrong with it.  Rule 1435 is silent as to
whether Indulgences have a Mintor or not, so there is no conflict on
this point with R1579.  Thus any "re-establishment" of the currency
must follow the first sentence of R1579, which insists that each
Currency has a Mintor.

Further, the whole notion does not give sufficient respect to the
natural meaning of "cease to exist".  A rule mandating that something
ceases to exist does not mean for the thing to have its existence
interrupted temporarily and then re-appear.  If R1579 is strong enough
to destroy Indulgences (or P-notes) as a currency, then it is strong
enough to keep them destroyed.

This brings us to the central question: _is_ R1579 strong enough to do
what it says?  Well, does it conflict with R1435?  No.  R1435 simply
says that Indulgences are a Currency; R1579 says that they are in fact
a destroyed Currency. (**) This is similar to the repeal of a Rule;
longstanding Game Custom holds that a Rule or Proposal which repeals
another Rule is not for that sole reason in conflict with it. (***)
Thus 1579 did cause Indulgences to cease to exist, and they still
cease to exist to the present time.

NOTES:

(*) This possibility was raised during the discussion of the issues
surrounding a similar situation with regards to P-notes, so it is as
well to dispose of it here.

(**) My fellow learned Justice Michael objected that an earlier
version involves a "secret" insertion of "defunct" into the rule.
This wording is what I meant.

(***) My fellow learned Justice Michael also objected here, pointing
out that Rules and Rule changes occupy separate worlds.  But I feel
this misses the point of my analogy: a Rule Change (proposed or
unproposed) is effective only by virtue of Rules that allow it to take
effect.  Do those Rules (which affect the content of the Ruleset)
actually _conflict_ with the Rule being repealed?

This would be like having an implicit clause in each Rule that stated
"This rule may not be repealed"; game custom says it does not.
Similarly, Rule 1479 does not contain an implied "this currency may
not be destroyed" as part of its defining sentence.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Justice Michael's decision: OVERTURN/reverse

If Indulgences exist, then a Payment Order was executed by the
Chancellor when he attempted to transfer 9 Indulgences from the Bank
to Elde.

If Indulgences exist, then the Indulgence Currency's Recordkeepor is
authorised to record and execute Payment Orders (R1596).

Thus, if Indulgences exist, the correct judgement for this CFJ is
FALSE.

The argument that Indulgences do not exist is based on R1579, which
states that all Currencies have a Mintor and if a Currency should lose
its Mintor, then it is destroyed.  It is accepted that an entity known
as the Mint was the Mintor for Indulgences before the Pragmatic
Currencies reform occurred.

By virtue of R1586, we must also accept that the Mint no longer
exists, so it would appear that the antecedent of the conditional
sentence of the second paragraph in R1597 holds.  So, what might
prevent Indulgences from being destroyed, as required by R1579?

The answer is the precedence taking R1435.  This states that
"Indulgences are a Currency".  This statement must remain true,
whatever R1579 says to the contrary.  My Fellow Justice elJefe claims
that this is possible if one reads "Indulgences are a Currency" as
"Indulgences are a destroyed Currency".

This is a senseless contortion.  We do not need to put the rules
through such hoops.  We have rules taking precedence over each other
all the time.  When we read "Indulgences are a Currency", we know that
this is equivalent to stating that there exists a Currency whose name
is "Indulgences".  But now the opposing argument wants us to
simultaneously read this as admitting the precise opposite, that this
Currency doesn't exist at all.

I refuse to make the Rules play such tricks.  If a high precedence
rule says that Indulgences exist, then the lower precedence R1579 can
yammer on about Mintors and the lack thereof all it likes.

Indulgences exist.

Judge elJefe's reasoning on CFJ 929 applies here as well.
