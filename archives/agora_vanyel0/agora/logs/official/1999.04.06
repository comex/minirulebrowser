Text of Adopted Proposals
======================================================================
Proposal 3849 (Vlad) AI = 1
Raus mit der Zeitgeist u. a.
     
* Rule 1047 "Patent Title of Zeitgeist" is hereby repealed.
  
* Amend Rule 649 to read as follows:

      There is a class of entities known as Patent Titles.  Patent
      Titles can be possessed only by persons.

      The Registrar shall maintain a list of all Patent Titles that
      have been awarded, and to whom they have been awarded, with the
      exception of any such Titles which have no Historical
      Significance. For the purposes of this Rule, any Title defined
      by the Rules to have no Historical SIgnificance has none. In
      addition, the Registrar may Act to declare any Title not
      referred to in th Rules to be without Historical Significance
      Without Objection. If such an action successfully occurs, then
      that Title also has no Historical Significance.

      This list is known as the Gold Pages, and is part of the
      Registrar's Report.

Proposal 3850 (Steve) AI = 1
Actions With Real Support

[Comment: the point of having Actions With N Supporters is surely that
the Support is supposed to come from other Players. Currently, a person
can Support their own action, which in the case of Actions With One
Supporter, is equivalent to simple authority to perform the action.]

Be it hereby resolved that R1874 (Actions With N Supporters) be amended
by replacing in it the text which currently reads:

      (b) between the two posts, N or more Players posted to the Public
          Forum supporting the change.

with text which reads:

      (b) between the two posts, N or more Players other than the Player
          intending to make the change posted to the Public Forum supporting
          the change.
