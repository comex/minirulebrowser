I hereby overturn Zefram's Judgements of CFJ 998 and 1001, in each
case ruling instead for dismissal. Judge Zefram was required by R1563
and by Rule 1565(iii) and (vi) to dismiss the CFJs.

I Judge that the Statement is FALSE.

The Statement is rather vague, but I intend to interpret it as
seeking to establish whether the game state ever changes except as
the result of human action. Game Custom is clear on this point. We
have many examples of self-repealing and self-amending Rules, not to
mention Proposals which have altered the game state in various ways
(cf RGB II). It may well be, as Vlad claims, that the ability of such
Rules and Proposals to act in the way they do is derivative of human
decisions to give the Rules authority. But it remains true that we
have granted such authority to the Rules. Derivative agency is still
agency.

As the Courts have found that Calabresi was not eligible to judge the
Appeal of CFJ 933, I hereby retract my claim that he did default on that
Appelate Judgement. Thus I hereby vacate the second of the 2 Payment Orders
of 3 Indulgences from Calabresi to the Bank which I executed on 2 October.

============================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

In CFJ 1045, I find the Statement to be TRUE.

I am in essential agreement with the Caller that Rule 1563 provides
more than adequate justification for Dismissing the named CFJs, in
spite of some arduous wording which made it briefly tempting - given
the rewards of returning a Judgement on, rather than Dismiss, these
CFJs - to wriggle my way out of it.


But wait, there is more.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the sum total of
Payment Orders in Indulgences naming that Player as Payor that they
have thus far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the sum total of Payment
Orders in Voting Tokens naming that Player as Payor that they have
thus far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Proposal Notes equal to the sum total of
Payment Orders in Indulgences naming that Player as Payor that they
have thus far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to the Registrar, requiring em to issue, for each Player, a
Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, that Player as Payee, for an
amount of 5 VTs. (So we can Vote on Proposals, y'know...)

The above facially satisfy provisions i) through iv) of Rule 663
pertaining to Injunctions; it is my belief that they also satisfy v), 
though that requires us to examine any Rule relevant thereto. I
find one, Rule 1736 itself, which states

      The Rules may require, in certain cases, that a Judge issue an
      Injunction ordering the execution of a Payment Order.  If the
      Payment Order required by such an Injunction is executed, and
      the Injunction itself later set aside, the Player who executed
      the required Payment Order shall, as soon as possible after the
      Injunction was set aside, vacate that Payment Order.

This merely states that Rules are permitted to require Judges to
issue Injuctions under certain circumstances; it is as far as I can
see no bar to a Judge taking it upon emself to issue any legal
Injuction. No prohibition of any kind in fact obtains with respect
to issuing Injuctions defined in 1736/1737; the procedure for issuing
an Injunction is well delineated, and followed to a T in this
Judgement; issuing an Injunctions in the present circumstances is 
therefore possible and unprohibited, which I submit is all that 'in a 
manner consistent with the Rules' requires.

Lastly, a note as to intent - obviously, this loophole can be used
for massive personal gain (well, once the status of Currencies has
been determined), and just as obviously it will be extremely tempting
for other Players assigned to Judge CFJs to take advantage of it for
the same reasons. It could also be used to summarily deregister 
anyone from the Game by assigning them 31 Blots.

There is no limit to how far this could be abused; if everyone jumps
on that bandwagon, all we will do is spoil the game absolutely.
Better we should fix that loophole, and quick, and refrain from
doing anything else about it for the sake of preserving the game's
fun.

I think the above is even-handed enough that Players (especially
Justices or Judges with CFJs currently assigned to em) will see their
own interest in letting it stand at that.

(And remember, you ain't seen nothing yet.)

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:


Relevant Rules: 1563

Rule 1563/1 (Power=1)
Statement of a CFJ

      In order to be Judged, a Call for Judgement must contain a
      single clearly-labeled Statement which must be able to be
      determined by the means of logical reasoning, with the
      presumption of perfect knowledge, to be either TRUE or FALSE.
      Statements which are inherently contradictory or which are
      vacuous are not acceptable, and a CFJ containing such a
      Statement shall not be Judged.

      If a Call for Judgement does not contain a Statement of the sort
      required by this Rule, its Judge is required to dismiss the CFJ,
      as described elsewhere.

      It is permitted for a Call for Judgement to contain Arguments,
      Evidence, or other material placed there at the Caller's
      discretion.  However, the Judge is not required to take notice
      of any part of the CFJ other than the Statement in formulating
      eir Judgement.

Before I begin arguing, I'd like to say that when I refer to "the
statement", I refer to the statement "This statement is TRUE.", and when I
refer to "the CFJ", I'm referring to the CFJ I am submitting.  I'm keeping
this consistancy so that it's clear what I am talking about.

The statement "This statement is TRUE." cannot be determined to be either
TRUE or FALSE by means of logical reasoning.

If the statement is TRUE, then it follows that the statement is TRUE, and
there's no contradiction.  If the statement is FALSE, then it follows that
the statement is FALSE, and there's no contradiction.  Therefore, the
statement is both TRUE and FALSE and is not either TRUE or FALSE.

The statement is also vacuous, and is therefore not acceptable.

vacuous (vàk´y¡-es) adjective
1.	Devoid of matter; empty.
2.	a. Lacking intelligence; stupid. b. Devoid of substance or meaning;
inane: a vacuous comment. c. Devoid of expression; vacant: "The narrow,
swinelike eyes were open, no more vacuous in death than they had been in
life" (Nicholas Proffitt).
3.	Lacking serious purpose or occupation; idle. See synonyms at EMPTY.
[From Latin vacuus, empty. See VACUUM.]
- vac´uously adverb
- vac´uousness noun

The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Third Edition
copyright © 1992 by Houghton Mifflin Company. Electronic version licensed
from InfoSoft International, Inc. All rights reserved.

definitions 2b, 2c, and 3 all support the statement being vacuous.
definition 1 would imply an empty statement, like a null set, but then
there would be no statement to be vacuous, so definition 1 does not apply.
definition 2a is a matter of taste, so it does not apply.

The statement has not substance or meaning in game terms or in terms of
anything other than the statement.

I'd like to also note that this CFJ must be judged TRUE if it is determined
by the judge that the statement cannot be judged TRUE or FALSE by logical
reasoning or the statement is vacuous.  Either one of those being TRUE (or
both being true) makes this CFJ true.

Two important remarks on CFJ 1045:

As I have been notified, there are not 44, but 34 Injunctions with
CFJ 1045. Furthermore I hereby want it to be clear that my message
specifying the Appelate Court on this message should be read as 34
Assignments of these Appelate Judgements.

Furthermore this number of 34 is only correct if my count of 11
Officers is correct.

                               CFJ 1046

Calabresi is ineligible to serve as a Justice in the Appeal of CFJ 933.

======================================================================

Judge:       Michael

Judgement:   

Eligible:    Blob, Calabresi, ChrisM, Chuck, Crito, Elde, 
	     elJefe, General Chaos, Harlequin, Kolja A., Michael, 
             Morendil, Murphy, Oerjan, Vir, Vlad, Zefram

Not eligible:
Caller:      Steve
Barred:      Andre
On request:  Vanyel
On hold:     Swann

======================================================================

History:
  Called by Steve, timestamp lost
  Assigned to Michael, 1 Oct 1997 19:33:25 +0200 (MET DST)
  Judged TRUE by Michael, 3 Oct 1997 16:50:35 +0100

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Rule 911 states in part:

      A Player is ineligible for selection if any of the following is
      true:

       iv) E was ineligible to Judge the CFJ that resulted in the
           matter under consideration, and this restriction does not
           prevent three eligible Players from being selected by the
           CotC for the Board.

CFJ 933 was called on Aug 4, a week before Calabresi registered to
play. Calabresi was, therefore, ineligible to Judge the CFJ, and so
satisfies the criterion of R911(iv) for being ineligible to serve
as Justice.

Andre has argued that Calabresi was later eligible to serve as a
Judge when the CFJ was re-assigned after the initial Judge defaulted.
This is true, but it no way changes the fact that Calabresi was, at
one time, ineligible to serve as Judge, and so is ineligible to serve
as Justice. R911 does not say that a Player who was never eligible
to serve as Judge is ineligible to serve as Justice.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

Judgement: TRUE

Reasons and arguments: 

R911 spells out the conditions under which a Player is ineligible for
selection as Justice.  It is clear and undisputed by the Caller that
Calabresi doesn't satisfy conditions i, ii, iii or v.

The question remains: was Calabresi ineligible to Judge the original
CFJ?  If so, then they are ineligible to serve as Justice in the
Appeal of that CFJ by condition iv.

This question needs careful consideration.  In particular, what sense
are we to make of the "was" in condition iv?  

It's clearly ridiculous to claim that this refers to arbitrary
instants of time in history, as we were all ineligible to judge CFJs
before they were called, before we joined the game or before the game
started. 

In fact the wording of the relevant rules makes it clear the
eligibility is an attribute that should only be calculated when a CFJ
is assigned a Judge.  

Here we come to our next problem: when the CFJ was first assigned,
Calabresi was not a Player.  The rules do not explicitly discuss the
eligibility status of non-Players, so we have to turn to common-sense
and game custom to tell us that non-Players are not eligible as
Judges.   (The language of the Judge selection rule (R951) tells us
that Judges are to be selected from amongst eligible Players, not
necessarily implying that other classes of people are ineligible.
However, here the common-sense view of what it is to be eligible must
be appealed to, if it is impossible for one to be selected for
something because of one's status, this is equivalent to being
ineligible.)

Therefore Calabresi is ineligible to serve as a Justice in the appeal
of CFJ 933.
