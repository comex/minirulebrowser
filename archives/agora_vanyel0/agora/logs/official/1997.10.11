In the Appeal of the CFJ 930, I hereby reverse the original Judgement
and find the Statement FALSE.

The other Justices, eljefe and Michael, have already done most of
the groundwork for this Judgement. They correctly identify the
existence of Indulgences as a Currency after the passage of P3533
as the pivotal point on which the truth of the Statement turns. If
Indulgences continued to exist after the adoption of P3533, then
the Statement is FALSE. If they did not, then the Statement is TRUE.

Justice Eljefe thinks that R1579, which calls for Indulgences to
cease to exist, and R1435, which states that Indulgences exist, can
be read so as not conflict with one another, by reading R1435 as
claiming that Indulgences exist, but as a destroyed Currency. I,
however, join Justice Michael in rejecting this interpretation as
contorted. I agree with Michael that R1579 conflicted with R1435
when it sought to bring the existence of Indulgences as a Currency
to an end. Since R1435 wins this precedence conflict, R1579 could
not be successful in ending the existence of Indulgences as a
Currency. Therefore, the Statement is FALSE.

A note about CFJ 929, to which this CFJ was a companion, and to which
Judge Chuck appealed in making his Judgement of this CFJ: it is worth
remarking that R1435 did not prevent R1579 from destroying all the
individual instances of Indulgences in circulation at the time P3533
took effect. It is therefore entirely possible that Chancellor G.
Chaos' Indulgence transfer to Elde could not be successfully executed
for that reason. It would depend on whether the Chancellor had minted
any more Indulgences before executing the Transfer Order. However,
both CFJs 929 and 930 claim not merely that no Transfer Orders and no
Payment Orders had been successfully executed, but additionally that
this was so specifically for the reason that no such Orders existed -
and this issue is independent of whether the Orders (specifically, the
Transfer Order) might not have been successfully executed by reason
of lack of funds in the Bank to cover them.

I hereby reverse Michael's Judgement and find that the Statement is
FALSE.

Although I completely agree with Michael's reasoning concerning how
Harlequin's message should have been interpreted, the fact is that
Michael's Judgement was made without reference to the possibility
that Harlequin's attempts to transfer VTs might have failed to
satisfy any Payment Orders simply because Harlequin, like every other
Player, had no VTs at the time, a consequence of the destruction of
Voting Tokens by P3533.

I am not aware of any other occasion on which General Chaos has
wrongfully denied a COE, so I conclude that the Statement, despite
its generality, is FALSE.

Speaker Steve

I judge that the Statement is TRUE.

Morendil has been Elde's Executor in Probate since being so designated
by Notary Murphy after Elde was deregistered the first time on July 25.
Morendil has neither resigned as Elde's EiP, nor has he announced that
Elde is no longer in Probate. Hence according to R1738, he remains
Elde's Executor in Probate.

I think this case falls under "If the Justices find that the original 
Judgement was incorrect but do not unanimously agree on an action to take
within the deliberation period, the CFJ shall be re-assigned as 
described above," so we'll select just another Judge. It also seems
that those who defaulted on, or delivered, appelate Judgement are
not made ineligible.

Appeals decisions

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Justice elJefe's decision: SUSTAIN

                              CFJ 930

"No Payment Orders have thus far been successfully executed, for the
 reason that none exist."

Judge Chuck relied on the reasoning of CFJ 929:

However, at the time of the CFJ, only one Transfer Order could have
been submitted, namely the Chancellor's transfer of 9 Indulgences
from the Bank to Elde. At that time the Mint (which was Mintor of
Indulgences) no longer had Mint Authority due to the effects of
Proposal 3533. Thus Indulgences ceased to exist as a Currency by
Rule 1579, and so the Chancellor's posting, not referring to any
Currency, was not a Transfer Order.

The only point in dispute is whether Indulgences continued to exist as
a currency after the adoption of Proposal 3533.  If they did then the
reasoning in the quoted paragraph of CFJ 929 is correct and the
judgement of TRUE stands.  If not then the judgement in both CFJs
should be FALSE, since the Misanthropists' currencies failed to
confuse itself with Payment Orders or Transfer Orders defined in the
Rules.

Quoting from Rule 1579: "If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist,
or ceases to have the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that
Currency are destroyed, and that Currency ceases to exist."  There is
unchallenged evidence that the old Mintor for Indulgences ceased to
exist, and that no new Mintor was designated.  Therefore unless this
conflicts with some higher-power Rule, it must be applied.

Rule 1435 begins "Indulgences are a Currency."  One possible
interpretation is that Indulgences were destroyed and ceased to exist
at a given instant; but then immediately after that R1435
re-established Indulgences as a Currency without a Mintor, which then
is immune to R1579 since it has no Mintor which can either cease
existing or lose Mint authority. (*)

This has several things wrong with it.  Rule 1435 is silent as to
whether Indulgences have a Mintor or not, so there is no conflict on
this point with R1579.  Thus any "re-establishment" of the currency
must follow the first sentence of R1579, which insists that each
Currency has a Mintor.

Further, the whole notion does not give sufficient respect to the
natural meaning of "cease to exist".  A rule mandating that something
ceases to exist does not mean for the thing to have its existence
interrupted temporarily and then re-appear.  If R1579 is strong enough
to destroy Indulgences (or P-notes) as a currency, then it is strong
enough to keep them destroyed.

This brings us to the central question: _is_ R1579 strong enough to do
what it says?  Well, does it conflict with R1435?  No.  R1435 simply
says that Indulgences are a Currency; R1579 says that they are in fact
a destroyed Currency. (**) This is similar to the repeal of a Rule;
longstanding Game Custom holds that a Rule or Proposal which repeals
another Rule is not for that sole reason in conflict with it. (***)
Thus 1579 did cause Indulgences to cease to exist, and they still
cease to exist to the present time.

NOTES:

(*) This possibility was raised during the discussion of the issues
surrounding a similar situation with regards to P-notes, so it is as
well to dispose of it here.

(**) My fellow learned Justice Michael objected that an earlier
version involves a "secret" insertion of "defunct" into the rule.
This wording is what I meant.

(***) My fellow learned Justice Michael also objected here, pointing
out that Rules and Rule changes occupy separate worlds.  But I feel
this misses the point of my analogy: a Rule Change (proposed or
unproposed) is effective only by virtue of Rules that allow it to take
effect.  Do those Rules (which affect the content of the Ruleset)
actually _conflict_ with the Rule being repealed?

This would be like having an implicit clause in each Rule that stated
"This rule may not be repealed"; game custom says it does not.
Similarly, Rule 1479 does not contain an implied "this currency may
not be destroyed" as part of its defining sentence.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Justice Michael's decision: OVERTURN/reverse

If Indulgences exist, then a Payment Order was executed by the
Chancellor when he attempted to transfer 9 Indulgences from the Bank
to Elde.

If Indulgences exist, then the Indulgence Currency's Recordkeepor is
authorised to record and execute Payment Orders (R1596).

Thus, if Indulgences exist, the correct judgement for this CFJ is
FALSE.

The argument that Indulgences do not exist is based on R1579, which
states that all Currencies have a Mintor and if a Currency should lose
its Mintor, then it is destroyed.  It is accepted that an entity known
as the Mint was the Mintor for Indulgences before the Pragmatic
Currencies reform occurred.

By virtue of R1586, we must also accept that the Mint no longer
exists, so it would appear that the antecedent of the conditional
sentence of the second paragraph in R1597 holds.  So, what might
prevent Indulgences from being destroyed, as required by R1579?

The answer is the precedence taking R1435.  This states that
"Indulgences are a Currency".  This statement must remain true,
whatever R1579 says to the contrary.  My Fellow Justice elJefe claims
that this is possible if one reads "Indulgences are a Currency" as
"Indulgences are a destroyed Currency".

This is a senseless contortion.  We do not need to put the rules
through such hoops.  We have rules taking precedence over each other
all the time.  When we read "Indulgences are a Currency", we know that
this is equivalent to stating that there exists a Currency whose name
is "Indulgences".  But now the opposing argument wants us to
simultaneously read this as admitting the precise opposite, that this
Currency doesn't exist at all.

I refuse to make the Rules play such tricks.  If a high precedence
rule says that Indulgences exist, then the lower precedence R1579 can
yammer on about Mintors and the lack thereof all it likes.

Indulgences exist.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Justice Steve's Decision: OVERTURN/reverse

In the Appeal of the CFJ 930, I hereby reverse the original Judgement
and find the Statement FALSE.

The other Justices, eljefe and Michael, have already done most of
the groundwork for this Judgement. They correctly identify the
existence of Indulgences as a Currency after the passage of P3533
as the pivotal point on which the truth of the Statement turns. If
Indulgences continued to exist after the adoption of P3533, then
the Statement is FALSE. If they did not, then the Statement is TRUE.

Justice Eljefe thinks that R1579, which calls for Indulgences to
cease to exist, and R1435, which states that Indulgences exist, can
be read so as not conflict with one another, by reading R1435 as
claiming that Indulgences exist, but as a destroyed Currency. I,
however, join Justice Michael in rejecting this interpretation as
contorted. I agree with Michael that R1579 conflicted with R1435
when it sought to bring the existence of Indulgences as a Currency
to an end. Since R1435 wins this precedence conflict, R1579 could
not be successful in ending the existence of Indulgences as a
Currency. Therefore, the Statement is FALSE.

A note about CFJ 929, to which this CFJ was a companion, and to which
Judge Chuck appealed in making his Judgement of this CFJ: it is worth
remarking that R1435 did not prevent R1579 from destroying all the
individual instances of Indulgences in circulation at the time P3533
took effect. It is therefore entirely possible that Chancellor G.
Chaos' Indulgence transfer to Elde could not be successfully executed
for that reason. It would depend on whether the Chancellor had minted
any more Indulgences before executing the Transfer Order. However,
both CFJs 929 and 930 claim not merely that no Transfer Orders and no
Payment Orders had been successfully executed, but additionally that
this was so specifically for the reason that no such Orders existed -
and this issue is independent of whether the Orders (specifically, the
Transfer Order) might not have been successfully executed by reason
of lack of funds in the Bank to cover them.

                               CFJ 1051

	"Morendil is Elde's Executor in Probate."

======================================================================

Judge:       Steve

Judgement:   TRUE

Eligible:    Andre, Blob, Calabresi, ChrisM, Chuck, Crito,
	     elJefe, General Chaos, Harlequin, Michael, 
             Morendil, Oerjan, Steve, Vir, Vlad, Zefram

Not eligible:
Caller:      Murphy
Barred:
On request:  Vanyel
On hold:     Swann, Kolja A.

======================================================================

History:
  Called by Murphy, 08 Oct 1997 23:23:37 -0700
  Assigned to Steve, 10 Oct 1997 20:47:18 +0200 (MET DST)
  Judged TRUE by Steve, 11 Oct 1997 18:39:12 +1000 (EST)

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Morendil becomes Elde's EiP.
Rule 1738 says that Elde's EiP is eir Executor, so Morendil is Elde's
  Executor and succeeds in reregistering Elde.
Elde becomes Blob's EiP.
By a similar argument, Elde is Blob's Executor and succeeds in reregistering
  Blob.
Elde is deregistered.
No Rule states that a Player who is deregistered loses eir Executor or EiP,
  so Morendil is still Elde's Executor and EiP.
Rule 1478's statement that Executors must be Players takes precedence over
  Rule 1738's claim that Blob's EiP (Elde) is eir Executor, so Elde is no
  longer Blob's Executor.
However, no Rule states that an EiP who is deregistered ceases to be EiP,
  so Elde is still Blob's EiP.

When Elde ceased to be Blob's Executor, e did not cease to be Blob's EiP -
precisely because the equality of EiP and Executor (which exists only
because Rule 1738 says so) is broken by way of Rule 1478 starting to take
precedence over Rule 1738.

======================================================================

Reasoning & Arguments Judge:

I judge that the Statement is TRUE.

Morendil has been Elde's Executor in Probate since being so designated
by Notary Murphy after Elde was deregistered the first time on July 25.
Morendil has neither resigned as Elde's EiP, nor has he announced that
Elde is no longer in Probate. Hence according to R1738, he remains
Elde's Executor in Probate.
