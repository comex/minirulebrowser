Rulekeepor's Memo
January 26, 1999

This memo includes effects due to Proposals 3823-3824 and Rule 1867.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

COMMENT:
Remember, next week is Read the Ruleset Week!  I plan to
distribute both an SLR and an FLR very early that week for the
benefit of those who wish to participate.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

PAYMENT ORDERS (cf. Rule 947):
Note: since the Repeal-O-Matic no longer exists, it is my opinion
that R947 imposes no duty on me in regards to P3824.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

CATEGORY CHANGES (cf. Rule 1048): None.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TITLE CHANGES (cf. Rule 1485):
The Title of Rule 1755 has been changed to "No Non-Player
Responsibilities" as per Proposal 3823.
The Title of Rule 721 has been changed to "The Vizier and the
Ordinancekeepor" as per Proposal 3823.

In the spirit of the current trend towards consistency, I announce my
intent to change the following Rule Titles Without Objection.  This
will bring the capitalization of all Rule Titles in line with _The
Chicago Manual of Style_, 14th edition, sections 7.127-8, with the
additional principle that words and phrases commonly capitalized in
Agoran usage are capitalized in Rule Titles as well (e.g., Rule 1016:
"Putting Oneself On Hold", not "Puting Oneself on Hold"; Rule 1761:
"Quorum Without Objection", not "Quorum without Objection".)  For Rule
408 I intend to make a more substantial change, as I feel the current
Title is awkward.

ANNOTATION CHANGES:
  OFFICIAL (cf. Rule 789): None.
  UNOFFICIAL (appear only in the FLR):
    Rule 693 has been annotated with:
     "[CFJ 1110 (Judged Dec. 11 1998; Appeal completed Dec. 22 1998) &
      CFJ 1111 (Judged Dec. 22 1998): When the voting period of a proposal
      whose voting period is in progress is changed via amendment of this
      Rule, an attempted vote is effective if (in addition to satsifying
      any other requirements imposed by the Rules) it was made after the
      start of the voting period and prior to its end, those times being
      determined by the text of this Rule at the time the vote is
      attempted.]"

----------------------------------------------------------------------

MISCELLANEOUS:
Numerous historical annotations have been added or expanded based on
Vlad's Prolegomena.
