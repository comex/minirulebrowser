======================================================================
Text of Adopted Proposals (unofficial)
======================================================================

Proposal 3555 (Steve)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
A Public Voting Experiment

[Comment: third time lucky, maybe?]

WHEREAS voting in Agora's long history has traditionally been by
secret ballot, and whereas it is well known to psephologists that
subtle changes in the mechanics of voting can have interesting
effects, we, the Voting Entities of Agora, do hereby resolve to conduct
the following Public Voting Experiment for the duration of a trial two-
month period, and to that end further resolve that a Rule, entitled
"A Public Voting Experiment", be created with the following text:

      Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
      any votes by Voting Entities on Proposals, Elections or Referenda,
      may only be achieved by sending a message to the Public Forum.

      This Rule shall repeal itself 60 days after it is created.

======================================================================

Proposal 3556 (Steve)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Disinterested Amendments can be Attributed

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 1623 be amended by deleting from it
the text:

      All Rule Changes in a Disinterested Proposal are Unattributed.

======================================================================

Proposal 3558 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Contract Law

Be it therefore resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      If two (or more) Players enter into an agreement, but one (or
      more) of these Players then fails to comply with that agreement,
      any other Player party to that agreement may make a CFJ alleging
      that that agreement has been broken.

      If the Judge of such a CFJ finds that the agreement has in fact
      been broken, e is permitted to issue Injunctions binding upon
      any or all of the parties of the broken agreement so as to
      effect fair and appropriate restitution for its breach.  When
      restitution would involve the transfer of Currencies, the Judge
      is authorized to execute whatever Payment Orders are necessary to
      effect fair and appropriate restitution.

      The above notwithstanding, no restitution shall be available
      with respect to the breach of the agreement which would have
      required a Player to break the Rules, nor shall restitution
      include the execution of Payment Orders, the payor of which is
      any entity not party to the agreement.

      Nothing in this Rule shall be construed so as to impair the
      enforcement of an agreement which requires a Player to violate
      another agreement.
      
      A CFJ alleging that an agreement has been broken called by
      anyone who is not party to that agreement lacks standing and
      shall be dismissed. 

======================================================================

Proposal 3559 (Murphy)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Clarify Judge Eligibility

Amend Rule 911 by replacing this text:

       iv) E was ineligible to Judge the CFJ that resulted in the
           matter under consideration, and this restriction does not
           prevent three eligible Players from being selected by the
           CotC for the Board.

with this text:

       iv) E was not eligible to Judge the CFJ that resulted in the
           matter under consideration when it was called, and this
           restriction does not prevent three eligible Players from
           being selected by the CotC for the Board.

======================================================================

Proposal 3560 (Murphy)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Clarify Movement

Amend Rule 1707 by replacing "where it Moves to" with "which Location
it Moves to".

======================================================================

Proposal 3562 (Oerjan)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Patent Title for Andre

Andre is awarded the Patent Title of .

======================================================================

Proposal 3563 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1565 be amended, to replace "3
Mil" with "1 VT".

======================================================================

Proposal 3564 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Fix Acclamation Timing

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1445 be amended, by appending the
following Paragraph:

      * Effective Time of Election Results: The results of an Election
      are effective at the time the results of the Referendum are
      announced; or, if there is no Referendum, at the time that the
      Vote Collector announces that there is to be no Referendum.

======================================================================

Proposal 3565 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Revise Applications

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1626 be amended to read:      

      An Application is any body of text designated as such by a
      Player.  This Player is known as its Sponsor.  

      A Player's Signature is added to an Application when e sends a
      message to that Application's Sponsor indicating that e wishes
      to sign it.  

      A Player's Signature is stricken from the Application when e
      sends a message to the Sponsor of the Application stating that e
      wishes eir signature stricken.  Further, the Sponsor of an
      Application may strike any Signature from the Application at any
      time.

      If an Application is amended in any way (except to add or strike
      a Signature), any and all Signatures which appear on it are
      stricken from it.

      An Application is Executed when its Sponsor submits it to
      whatever Officer or other Player is designated by the Rules to
      receive Applications of that particular type, with whatever
      effect is defined by the Rules for the Execution of that type of
      Application.  However, any other Rule notwithstanding, the
      Execution of an Application shall have no effect unless Executed
      within 14 days of the time the oldest Signature which appears on
      it was added.  

      If a Player Executes an Application which contains Signatures
      added to it in a manner inconsistent with this Rule, e commits
      the Crime of Application Fraud, a Class D Crime.

Be it further resolved, that Rules 1627, 1628, and 1629 be repealed.

[The present Rules for Applications require the destruction of
Applications in certain situations, and have other odd
conceptualizations that are at odds with common sense.]

======================================================================

Proposal 3566 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1465 be amended, by replacing the
string "the Assessor shall pay out" with "the Registrar shall pay
out".

[It makes more sense for the Registrar to pay out Champion's Rewards,
since it is the Registrar that keeps track of who has received a
Champion's Reward.]

======================================================================

Proposal 3568 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested, Emergency)
PI Amnesty

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1713 be amended, by appending the
following paragraph:

      With the exception of this paragraph, this Rule shall have no
      effect prior to the first day of December, 1997.
