OFF:  New Proposals

There are seven new proposals distributed as of this report.

d = Disowned

D  3575 Kolja A. 1 Fix Internomic referenda

======================================================================
Proposal 3569 (Zefram)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Fix Currencies 

Be it therefore resolved that Rule 1701 ("Proposal Notes") be amended
to read

      Proposal Notes (P-Notes) are a Currency.  The MUQ of P-Notes is 1.
      The Recordkeepor for P-Notes is the Promotor.  The Mintor of
      P-Notes is the Bank.

      The Promotor's Report includes the number of P-Notes possessed by
      each entity which possesses them, and the changes thereof since
      the last posting of the Promotor's Report.

      Whenever a Player registers who has never before possessed any
      P-Notes, the Promotor shall pay out 5 P-Notes to that Player.

{Modelled after R1696.  The change in the final paragraph removes a bug:
the previous version could be read as obliging the Promotor to pay out
P-Notes an infinite number of times.}

Be it further resolved that Rule 1435 ("Definition of Indulgences,
Blots and Immaculate") be amended to read

      Indulgences are a Currency.  The MUQ of Indulgences is 1.
      The Recordkeepor for Indulgences is the Herald.  The Mintor of
      Indulgences is the Bank.

      The Herald's Report includes the number of Indulgences possessed
      by each entity which possesses them, and the changes thereof since
      the last posting of the Herald's Report.

      A Payment Order for a number of Indulgences, the payee of which
      is the Bank, is known as that number of Blots.  When a Rule states
      that a Player is to gain some number of Blots, a Payment Order shall
      be executed with that Player as the payor, the Bank as the payee,
      and for a number of Indulgences equal to the number of Blots that
      Player is to receive.  This order is to be executed by whomever
      is required to report the change in Blots.

      A Player may be said to have a number of Blots equal to the sum
      of the amounts of all Payment Orders for Indulgences naming em
      as the payor and the Bank as payee, including orders which are
      disputed (but not those which have been vacated).  A Player with
      no such Payment Orders is Immaculate.  It is a Win-Preventing
      condition for a Player to have one or more Blots.

Be it further resolved that a Rule be created, with Title "Blot Amnesty",
reading

      Upon the creation of this Rule, the Herald shall report, as soon
      as possible, all Infractions of Persistent Indebtedness that have
      been committed and not previously reported.  When e has done so,
      e is then authorised and obliged to, as soon as possible, vacate
      all unsatisifed Payment Orders for Indulgences.  Immediately after
      e has done so, this Rule repeals itself.

{Complete amnesty -- the only solution that will really work.}
 
======================================================================
Proposal 3570 (Zefram)  AI = 3  (Disinterested)
No Win Situation 

Be it therefore resolved that Rules
       112 ("Ways to Win and Preclusions Thereof"),
       755 ("Champions"),
      1465 ("Champion's Reward"),
      1498 ("Winning by Blots"),
      1580 ("Multiple Winners of a Single Game"),
      1622 ("Forfeiting the Game"),
      1638 ("Announcing a Win"),
      1663 ("Win by Proposals"),
      1675 ("Pitchfork-Wielding Angry Villagers"),
      1697 ("Multiple rapid wins prohibited"), and
      1729 ("Insanity")
be repealed.

Be it further resolved that Rule 1435 ("Definition of Indulgences,
Blots and Immaculate") be amended by deleting the sentence

                                             It is a Win-Preventing
      condition for a Player to have one or more Blots.

Be it further resolved that Rule 1672 ("The Frankenstein Generator")
be amended by deleting the paragraph

     viii) Whenever a Win by Pitchfork is legally announced by the Mad
           Scientist, all text between the first and last paragraphs
           of the Frankenstein Rule shall be deleted from the
           Frankenstein Rule.
 
======================================================================
Proposal 3571 (Murphy)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)

Create a Rule with this text:

     October 16, 1997, shall be known as Lost In Space Day.

[Comments:  What the hell.]

 ======================================================================
Proposal 3572 (Steve)  AI = 3  (Disinterested)
Prohibit Retroactivity

[Comment: Rule 108 has turned out to be a lot weaker than we
thought. This proposal will give it back some teeth. Thanks go
to Chuck for the wording.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 108 be amended to read:

      A given form of a Rule may not have effects earlier than
      the moment it came to have that form. The form of a Rule
      consists of its text and other substantive properties.

      No Rule Change may have retroactive application.

Be it further resolved that the Authors of Rule 108 are Peter Suber,
Steve and Chuck.

======================================================================
Proposal 3573 (Steve)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Majority Appeal decisions

[Comment: in a couple of CFJs recently, we have seen a majority of
the Justices agree to overturn a decision - only to have the CFJ
then reassigned because of the way R1693 is worded. I propose to
fix this problem. In general, I have tried to make clearer the
relationship between the rulings of individual Justices and the
Board's ruling.]

Be it hereby resolved that R1693 be amended to read:

      If the Judgement of a CFJ is Appealed, the Board of Appeals
      shall consider the correctness of that Judgement. The Board may
      rule that the original Judgement was either correct or incorrect.

      If a majority of the Justices find that the original Judgement
      was correct, then the Board's ruling is that the original
      Judgement was correct. In that case, the original Judge of the
      CFJ shall retain eir Judicial Salary and the original Judgement
      has legal effect.

      If a majority of the Justices find that the original Judgement
      was incorrect, then the Board's ruling is that the original
      Judgement was incorrect. In that case, the original Judge
      of the CFJ shall forfeit eir Judicial Salary. The Board may
      then act in one of three ways, provided that a majority of
      the Justices agree:

        i) Reversal of the Judgement. In this case, the CFJ shall
           be treated as if it were Judged normally, with the
           Judgement being that which a majority of the Justices 
           agree on.
       ii) Dismissal of the CFJ. The CFJ shall be considered
           dismissed.
      iii) Re-assignment of the CFJ. In this case, the original
           Judgement shall be ignored, and the CotC shall reassign
           the CFJ to a new Judge in the same fashion as it was
           originally assigned; the original Judge will be
           considered Ineligible. The new Judge cannot make the
           same Judgement as the original Judge for the same
           reason.

      If a majority of the Justices find that the original Judgement
      was incorrect, but no majority of the Justices agree on what
      action to take, then the CFJ shall be re-assigned as above. 

======================================================================
Proposal 3574 (Kolja A.)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Judicial Cleanup

1. Amend 1563 by replacing the second paragraph with

If a CFJ fails to meet the requirements of this or of other rules it
lacks standing and is to be dismissed.

2. Cosmetic changes: 

Amend 1565 by

replacing the string "when only when" in the third paragraph by "only
when".

And in the last paragraph relacing "a Judicial Salary of 3 Mil" by "a
Judicial Salary of 1 VT".
---

[Note that the last change will simply be ineffective if Scott's
proposal is accepted.]

======================================================================
Proposal 3575 (Kolja A.)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Fix Internomic referenda

Amend 1632 by adding the following sentence to the third paragraph
(Duration of Voting):

If this leads to a Voting Period that is shorter than three days, the
Voting Period shall instead last for three days or until two days
before the InterNomic Voting Period on the relevant InterNomic
Proposal is over, whichever is earliest.
---

[Note that, if this still does not lead to a voting period of a
positive length, the Ambassador has clearly failed to distribute the
proposal ASAP, according to 1632.]

    Kolja A. transfers one Kudo FROM Andre TO Steve.

    I transfer one Kudo from Andre, for repeatedly ignoring my requests
    for ineligibility to judge, my coming off hold and, more recently,
    even my existence (sniff...) in many recent CFJ assignments, to Steve
    for eir contribution to game balance by spreading some VTs.

    Kolja A. transfers one Kudo FROM Kolja A. TO Andre.

    I also transfer one Kudo from me, for lack of a better victim, to
    Andre, for starting this voluntary VT distribution business.

The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of
a VOC directive was the report published in the PF on 1996/08/13
(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

AFAIK, no Herald's Report has ever been successfully ratified.

OFF:  New Proposals

There is one new proposals distributed as of this report.

I received this not long after I had put together the last report, so I'll go
ahead and distribute it now.  Besides it does not appear to be a very serious
proposal (although it is not Silly 8).  Wonder what effect it would have on
Payment Orders?  Spelling errors don't affect the meaning of Nomic
communications, but do they affect the meaning of a Rule?  8)

======================================================================
D = Disinterested
d = Disowned
S = Silly
E = Emergency
 
D  3576 Zefram   3.1 (untitled)

======================================================================
Proposal 3576 (Zefram)  AI = 3.1  (Disinterested)

Be it therefore resolved that a Rule be created with Power 3.1, reading

      Any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, no such thing as a
      Currency, a Paymont Order, a Transfer Order, or a unit of
      Currency, exists.
