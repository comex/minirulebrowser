======================================================================

                               CFJ 940

Rule 1596 should be interpreted so that a message purporting to
be a Payment Order must, in order to satisfy that Rule's requirements
and qualify as a legal Payment Order, explicitly and unambiguously
state that the purported Payor is ordered to effect a payment as
a consequence of that message, e.g. by stating "Player X is commanded
to pay Y", the mere mention of an amount of a Currency, the name or
names of the Payor and Payee, or a reference to some Rule or some
situation that requires a Payment Order to be executed being
insufficient for a message not containing such a command or entreaty
to qualify as a Payment Order.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

I believe this follows from Rule 1596's definition of a Payment Order
as "an order requiring an entity to" perform some action, and that no
message not framed as a command is a legal Payment Order.

Note that the claim that a particular message _is_ a Payment Order
is by that reasoning sufficient to satisfy Rule 1596's requirement.

I kindly request that the Judge of the CFJ enjoin the Rulekeepor to
annotate R1596 with the above statement and the list of relevant
Rules which follows : 1596.

======================================================================

Decision and Reasoning Judge:

I judge this statement to be TRUE.

Injunction:
I hereby enjoin the Rulekeepor to annotate Rule 1596
with the statement and list of relevant Rules of this CFJ.

Reasons and Arguments:
I agree with the Caller's arguments.

======================================================================

Decision and Reasoning CotC:

In the issue of the Appelate decision of CFJ 940 I find the Judgement
incorrect. To me the fact that something is a Payment Order makes it
a priori what a Payment Order is defined to be, no matter in what
exact form it is brought out.

As can be seen from the discussions on agora-discussion it is not easy
to decide when a certain text is a Payment Order and when it isn't.
However, we are not to judge on that, as the premisse in the Statement
already is that the message is purporting to be a Payment Order.
Any phrase making it clear that a text is a Payment Order, makes it so,
provided that the provisions in the second sentence of Rule 1596 are
met. If further it is posted to the Public Forum, and by a Player with
the authority to execute it, it is executed.

I thus find the Judgement incorrect, and request REVERSAL of the
Judgement.

======================================================================

Decision and Reasoning Justiciar:

Decision of the Justiciar:   FALSE (reversing the original Judgement)

Rule 1596 begins:

      A Payment Order is an order requiring an entity (the payor) to
      submit a Transfer Order transferring units of a Currency from
      itself to some other entity (the payee).  A Payment Order
      specifies exactly one source entity, exactly one destination
      entity, exactly one Currency, and a number of units of that
      Currency which is a positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ.

The question is whether one could devise something that is unambiguously
(but not explicitly) an order, requiring a specified entity to submit a TO
for a specified amount of currency from itself to another specified entity,
_without_ explicitly and unambiguously stating that the purported Payor is
ordered to effect a payment as a consequence of that message.  I believe we
can.

Any ambiguity in the payee, payor, or amount of currency fails the Rule's
requirement that these are "specified".   "The Bank is ordered to pay
Player X" is not sufficient (though this sentence could possibly be part of
a complete and valid PO).  But if I say that "I order the Bank to pay 1 VT
to Player X," that is explicit and is a Payment Order, assuming I had
authority to issue it.

Suppose we do not _explicitly_ state that the Bank is commanded to effect a
payment as a consequence.  If the Speaker says "Player X is awarded one VT
from the Bank, for meritorious conduct," then this alone is not
unambiguously an order and on its own would not be a PO.  (As others have
pointed out, it could just be an observation.)

However, this sentence together with other text could be an order.  Suppose
the Speaker posts a message consisting of

        --------------------------------------------
                      OFFICIAL NOTICE
                    Speaker's Patronage

        Player X is awarded one VT from the Bank,
        for meritorious conduct.
        --------------------------------------------

Surely in the old days the person responsible for recording VTs would have
treated this entire message as an order and felt required to act upon it.
It unambiguously (but not explicitly) requires the Bank to pay a specified
amount of currency to a specified player, and nowadays that will mean
issuing a Transfer Order. Thus it satisfies all the requirements for a PO.

This is sufficient to determine the decision, so I will not lengthen this
decision by considering Blots.  But I will say that these are a thorny
issue involving interactions of rules, and the question of whether an order
can "specify" things like payees, payors, and amounts, by having the
players delve into various Rules to determine them.  It is not clear.

Regards,
-- elJefe, Justiciar

======================================================================

Decision and Reasoning Speaker:

It is the opinion of the Speaker that the Judgement in CFJ 940 should
be OVERTURNED, and that the original Judgement be REVERSED.

I concur with my fellow Justices on this matter.  While there is
indeed a substantial issue as to whether certain phrases are or are
not Payment Orders, the requirements expressed in the Statement of
this CFJ go far beyond the statutory requirements of Rule 1596.  I see
no reason to believe that Rule 1596 requires that any of the elements
of a Payment Order (Payee, Payor, Currency, or amount) be _explicitly_
specified in a message which purports to convey a Payment Order.  All
that need be required is that the message be clearly identifiable as
conveying a Payment Order, and that all of the elements of the Payment
Order thus conveyed be determinable with reasonable certainty, either
from being explicitly stated within that message, or reasonably
deducible from the context in which that message was sent.  I leave
the question as to what constitutes "reasonably deducible" and
"reasonable certainty" to future Judges; it is not an issue in this
matter.

I also take issue with the claim that a message might purport to be a
Payment Order.  A message may purport to convey a Payment Order, but
all Rule 1596 states is that a Payment Order is an order.  There is no
reason to believe that an order is a message; rather, I contend that
messages are a means (and, in this case, the sole legally effective
mean) to convey orders to their obligees.  The confusion is
understandable, but I do not wish this confusion of terms to become
entrenched, and so I take this opportunity to expound upon it.

Respectfully submitted,

General Chaos
Speaker of Agora Nomic
