Text of Adopted Proposals
======================================================================

Proposal 3651 (G.Chaos)  AI = 1
Loophole Avoidance 

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1741 be amended, by appending to
it the paragraph:

      However, this Rule shall not apply to a Proposal if it would
      have the effect of prohibiting all Voting upon that Proposal.
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 3652 (G.Chaos)  AI = 1.5  (Disinterested)
Kill the Damn Monster, Already 

WHEREAS, it has been amply demonstrated that the Frankenstein Mutator,
while occasionally amusing, has the overall effect of making the Game
consistently unplayable,

and WHEREAS, at least some of the Players of this Nomic prefer to have
some semblance of stability,

and WHEREAS, the confusion and complexities that the Frankenstein
Mutator introduces makes performing the duties of the various Offices
of the Game so tedious and complicated as to not be worth the effort,
thereby threatening to render the Game unplayable through lack of
recordkeeping,

BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED, that the following Rule be created with
Power 1.5 and the following text:

      Upon the creation of this Rule, Rules 1671, 1672, 1673, and 1674
      shall be repealed.  Once this has occured, this Rule shall
      repeal itself.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 3653 (G.Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Innocent Error Defense 

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1575 be amended, by appending a
paragraph reading 

      Furthermore, it is a defense to any accusation of a Crime that
      the Player reasonably believed that eir actions were not a
      Crime at the time e performed them, or that e reasonably did not
      know that e was required to perform an action, when such
      nonperformance is defined as a Crime.  No Player shall be
      convicted of a Crime if this defense applies.

Proposal 3654 (G.Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank

Be it therefore resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      If an entity transfers Currency to the Bank without specifying a
      purpose for doing so, or if e specifies a purpose for doing so,
      but the transfer fails to accomplish that purpose, the Bank
      shall, as soon as possible, transfer that Currency back to that
      entity.

Proposal 3655 (G.Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Fix Indulgence Distribution 

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1712 be amended to read:

      At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Herald shall randomly
      distribute a number of Indulgences equal to the number of Blots
      executed in the past Week, less the number of Blots vacated in
      the past Week, among all Players: for each such Indulgence, the
      Herald shall randomly select one Player and issue a Payment
      Order from the Bank to that Player for one Indulgence.  If this
      number is negative, no distribution occurs.

                               CFJ 1077

 "Rule 833 should be interpreted such that it does not cause the
  Proposer of a failed Disinterested Proposal to be billed 1 P-Note."

Relevant rules: 833, 1623

======================================================================
Judge:       Steve

Rule 833 states that "If the Sponsor and the Proposer of a Proposal
are not the same and the Proposal fails, the Assessor shall bill the
Proposer 1 P-Note." At issue here is how we should interpret Rule 833
in the case where a Proposal does not have a Sponsor because it is
Disinterested. The Caller asserts that the quoted sentence is
meaningless in this case and cannot make any requirements.

Having considered the matter, I find I must reject the Caller's
argument. It is my view that in the case where a Proposal does not
have a Sponsor, it is, strictly speaking, correct to assert that the
Sponsor and the Proposer are not the same. An analogous case is the
sentence "My father and Santa Claus are not the same person.", which
is undoubtedly true and not meaningless in spite of the fact -
indeed, very largely because of the fact - that Santa Claus does not
exist.

It is my Judgement that Rule 833 does cause the Proposer of a failed
Disinterested Proposal to be billed 1 P-Note. The Statement is
therefore FALSE.
