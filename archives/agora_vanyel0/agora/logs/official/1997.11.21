Promotor Crito, 

I should like to submit the following proposal:  (I won't be paying a
P-note fee, making it disinterested)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal: Resignation of Offices cleared up

Amend rule 880 to read:

An Officer is always permitted to resign from any Office e holds.  If
a resigning Officer specifies another Player to succeed them, and this
Player has previously (within the last seven days) indicated their
willingness to so succeed in the Public Forum, then the designated
successor becomes the temporary holder of the Office. 

If a resigning Officer does not specify a successor, or specifies
someone who has not consented to the appointment, then the Speaker
becomes the temporary holder of the Office.

A change in the identity of the Speaker does not automatically cause
the transfer of any Offices being held by the former Speaker to the
new Speaker.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I believe this proposal has the virtue of simplicity and brevity
(being half the length of Steve's proposal).  Apologies to those who
feel these things should be proto-ed; I felt that it would be good to
have two competing proposals to vote for in the same distribution
batch. 

Michael.

======================================================================
(Caller's) Arguments:

Rule 1006: An Office must be held by a Player.
Rule 790:  The Winner of the Election shall hold the Office.

This is a conflict.  Rule 790 takes precedence, so Morendil (a non-Player)
holds the Office of Speaker-Elect.

Now:

Rule 1006: An Officer is a player holding an Office.

This is an explicit definition.  There is no conflict with any other Rule,
so the Office of Speaker-Elect is held by someone who is not an Officer
(Morendil).

Rule 790:  An Office is held in the normal fashion only if held by an
_Officer_ who was elected to it (among other things).

The Office of Speaker-Elect does not satisfy this requirement.  Therefore
it is not being held in the normal fashion.


======================================================================
Judge's Arguments:

Rule 1006 does clearly require an officer to be a Player. However,
as has been pointed out, it is trumped in ths case by 760. It remains
to be seen how this affects the readin of the rest of 760

An Office is "held in the normal fashion" if and only if the
      Officer holding that Office was elected to that Office and has
      neither resigned from it nor been retired or removed from it.
      An Office which is not held in the normal fashion is said to be
      held temporarily.

I must disagree that this directly requires an Office to be held
by an Officer to be held "in the normal fashion" It seems transparent
that this is simply an assumption made by the Rule, not aware of the
possible ramifications of the rest of the Rule. To interpret this
implicit assumption as imposing any sort of requirement is, in my
opinion, strained, particularly as the Rule still makes sense if
we read Officer in the sense of "person holding an Office" rather
than in the specialized sense used by 760, and since it is 760
itself that, elsewhere, defeats the definition that 1006 attempts to
impose. This interpretation does least violence to the Rule.

Vlad

======================================================================
Decision of Justice Kolja A.:

I disagree that there is s conflict between 1006 and 790 here, as the
caller of this CFJ claims. As the original judge of this CFJ also
based eir judgement on the existence of such a conflict, I'll try to
start all over again.


If 790 said "if the _person_ holding that office...", this CFJ would
obviously have to be judged false, because the further conditions
given in 790 are all true for Morendil: e "was elected to that Office
and has neither resigned from it nor been retired or removed from it."

If 790 said "if the _player_ holding that office..." it would have to
be judged true, because Morendil was not a player at the time when
this CFJ was called.

However, 790 does say "if the _officer_ holding that office...". I
_suspect_ that the author of 790 is using "officer" as a simple
synonym for "holder of an office" here, but this is not what counts
for this judgement. What counts is that an officer is defined in 1006
as a _player_ holding an office.

So at the time this CFJ was made there was no "officer" (in the sense
of 1006) holding the office of speaker elect. Morendil was holding the
office, but e was not a player and thus not an officer. Therefore, the
first sentence of 790 was not true (although in a way the author
of this rule probably never had in mind, but that is not the question
here).

Thus, the statement of this CFJ is true.

I therefore judge to overturn the original judgement and deliver a new
judgement of TRUE.


======================================================================
Decision of Speaker Morendil:

To begin with, let me note that both Caller and Judge appear to be
in agreement that a conflict between Rules 790 and 1006, with 790
having the higher precedence, results in a situation where a person
who is not a Player may under some circumstances come to "hold an
Office". Further, the Courts have not at this time been called upon
to examine this issue, which I will therefore not adress.

The Caller's opening remarks constitute, in my opinion, an
unfortunate restatement of the two key provisions of Rule 1006,
which I will therefore quote again :

      An Office is a position of authority or responsibility
      established by the Rules and held by a Player, who is called an
      Officer.

      At any time, an Office is held by exactly one Player; if no
      other Rule directly or indirectly specifies which Player holds
      an Office, it shall be held by the Speaker.

Both of these provisions would in their own right prevent a person
who is not a Player from acceding to the "position of authority or
responsibility" that we know as an Office, or from being conferred
"whatever duties, responsibilities, or privileges" the Rules assign
to such a position.

The Caller's restatement of the first of these provisions, as "An
Officer is a Player holding an Office", is in my opinion unwarranted.
It is logically equivalent to "All Officers are Players who hold an
Office", whereas the actual wording is logically equivalent to "All
Players who hold an Office are Officers", two statements which are
definitely not equivalent to each other.

The Caller would, in light of the foregoing, have us read Rule 790
in a manner slightly different from its actual wording; would have
Rule 790 interpreted to mean

      An Office is "held in the normal fashion" if and only if the
      Player holding that Office was elected to that Office (...)

I agree that this wording would require us to conclude that a person
holding an Office could not be said to hold that Office "in the
normal fashion".

However, Rule 790 does state "if the Officer holding that Office",
etc. In normal circumstances, we would look to Rule 1006 to
determine which person this is referring to.

However, while Rule 1006 does give a definition of the term "Officer"
that is useful whenever the situation is such that an Office is held
by a person who is a Player, that definition most certainly does not
apply to non-Players. Therefore, and this is the crucial point,

  Rule 1006 is silent as to whether persons who hold an Office and
  are not Players are "Officers".

The Caller's undue emphasis on the use of the word "Officer" in Rule
790 is thus misleading; the question at hand must be resolved by an
appeal to Rule 1006, not 790, and, that Rule being silent on the
issue, by appeal to the standards listed in Rule 217.

It is this Justice's opinion that "Officer" is an adequate, sensible
label to refer to a person holding an Office, for want of a more
appropriate label, and that its use in this context is consonant
with the traditions of Agora. I therefore have no reason not to
Sustain Judge Vlad's Judgement of FALSE.


======================================================================
Decision of Justice Steve:

In the matter of the Appeal of the Judgement of CFJ 1065, I overturn
Vlad's Judgement and find the Statement TRUE.

Judge Vlad erred in law in asserting that R790 does not require
that an Office be held by a Player in order that it be held in
the normal fashion. The language of R790 is very strong: the
construction used is 'if and only if', the language of necessity
and sufficiency. An Office is held in the normal fashion if and
only if the Officer holding that Office was elected to that Office.
Since R1006 defines an Officer as a Player, one is forced to
the conclusion that a non-Player holding an Office cannot be an
Officer. Since Morendil, a non-Player at the time this CFJ was
called, was holding the Office in virtue of the high precedence
of R790, I conclude that Morendil was not then an Officer.

I also reject the Michael's suggestion that R790 implicitly
defers to R1006 and so avoids conflict with it, and affirm with
the Caller the conflict between these two Rules. This conflict
arises almost inevitably from the hole left in the Rules
concerning Candidates for Election, and the Winners of Elections,
which does not prevent a non-Player from continuing as a Candidate
in and Winning an Election.
