======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

As Oerjan pointed out, there was an instant of time when Voting Tokens
also ceased to have a Mintor.
Decision of the Justiciar: TRUE (sustaining the original Judgement)

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

In CFJ 933, Elde Judges the Statement to be TRUE.

The reasons for thinking so are briefly outlined as follows :

* before 3533 passed, the Mint was a Nomic Entity
* the Mint was defined by Rule 1470
* 3533 amended 1470 so that it no longer defined the Mint
* by Rule 1586, the Mint ceased to exist
* at that time, the Mintor of VTs was still the Mint (1696)
* by Rule 1579, all VTs were therefore destroyed at that instant
* (thereafter, 1696 was amended to make the Bank the VT Mintor)

Rule 1579 stated :

      If the designated Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist or ceases
      to possess Mint Authority, all units of that Currency are
      destroyed and the Currency ceases to exist.

It has been suggested that Rule 1579 was at that time in conflict 
with Rule 1471, which stated

      The Mintor of a Currency may, at any time, destroy those units
      of that Currency which it currently possesses in its Treasury,
      so long as this destruction is permitted by the Rules.  Units of
      Currency may not be otherwise destroyed except as specifically
      authorized by the Rules.

separate support for this position being sought from this provision 
in Rule 1467 :

      Neither Currencies nor units of Currency shall be created or
      destroyed except as specified by the Rules.

It must be noted that Rule 1579's provisions both authorize, and
specify the manner of, the destruction of units of any Currency
falling under its purview; therefore, no conflict exists, precisely
because of both 1467's and 1471's conflict-avoiding provisions.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Justiciar:

Judge Elde/Morendil argues that during implementation of the Proposal, a
rule change caused the Mint to cease being a mintor when it was the mintor
of VTs, before another rule change made the Bank the mintor of VTs.

There are several different interpretations on how the provisions of a
Proposal are implemented, which may affect the argument.  (For example, if
the provisions are implemented simultaneously, then the Mint did not cease
to be a mintor _before_ the Bank was mintor.)

But no matter which interpretation is chosen, it remains that the Mint
_did_ cease to have Mint Authority.  CFJ 828 (Destruction of Group Coins)
teaches that this is enough to satisfy the precise wording of Rule 1579,
even if it could be shown that VTs had a mintor at every legally
significant time.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Original Judge's argument

Proposal 3533, the Pragmatic Currencies proposal, was implemented under
authority of Rule 594.  Judge Elde argues that at the time Rule 1470 was
amended (depriving the Mint of Mint Authority),  Rule 1696 still named the
Mint as the Mintor for VTs. The conclusion is that Rule 1579 acted at that
moment to destroy all Voting Tokens.


2. How the provisions of a Proposal are implemented

There are several interpretations of the Rules on how the provisions of a
Proposal are implemented.

The Sequential View:   Each provision is implemented in order, if allowed
                       by the Rules then in effect, and the Game State is
                       adjusted to include consequent effects of this before
                       turning to the next provision.

The Atomic View:       Each provision is implemented in order, if allowed
                       by the Rules in effect at the adoption of the Proposal,
                       but no consequent effects cause an adjustment to the
                       Game State until all provisions have been dealt with.

The Simultaneous View: All the provisions are considered to be implemented
                       simultaneously,  if allowed by the Rules in effect
                       at the adoption of the Proposal, except where
                       dependencies among the provisions require that some
                       are implemented in sequence with other ones.

All three of these are consistent with the Rules, and the choice between
them must therefore rest on "game custom, commonsense, past Judgements, and
the best interests of the game."

The present decision does not require us to choose among these, and thus we
refrain from expressing an opinion as to which is preferred.


3.  Destruction of Game Coins, CFJ 828

It's fair to compare the present situation to the one arising in CFJ 828.
In that case, Proposal 1760 had revamped the Group rules but had forgotten
to provide that each Group was the mintor of its own Group Coins, or in
fact that Groups were permitted to be the mintors of anything.  However, a
Rule (1467) provided that "The Mintor of a Currency is the Mint if it is
not otherwise defined."

But the clear meaning of Rule 1471, worded very much like the two most
recent forms of Rule 1579, is that when one entity ceases to have authority
to mint a currency and another begins to have that authority in its stead,
then that currency is indeed destroyed.

The judgement in CFJ 828 states:
>Rule 1474/0 clearly said that the Mintor for a Group's Coins was the
>Group. That language was amended away by Proposal 1760, and the Group
>issuing the Coins then ceased to have authority to be a Mintor, that
>authority now going to the Mint.
>
>Rule 1471/0 states that
>
>   If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist, or ceases to have
>                                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
>   the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that Currency
>   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
>   are immediately destroyed, and Currency ceases to exist.
>
>
>Therefore the old Coins ceased to exist upon adoption of Proposal 1760.
[...]
>
>Even though a conclusion is inconvenient, the temptation of avoiding it
>by misinterpreting the Rules, or language, must be resisted.  The change
>of Mintor means that one entity ceased to have the authority and another
>one began having it.


Rule 1579/1 partly stated:
      If the designated Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist or ceases
      to possess Mint Authority, all units of that Currency are
      destroyed and the Currency ceases to exist.

Rule 1579/2 partly stated:
      If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist, or ceases to have
      the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that Currency
      are destroyed, and that Currency ceases to exist.


The inclusion of "designated" in Rule 1579/1 is not enough to change the
result.  The meaning of "mintor" and "designated mintor" have at all times
been the same, namely the mintor designated by the Rules.

Thus I rule that the statement was correctly judged TRUE.

=====================================================================

Decision & Reasoning pro-CotC:


To judge this statement, I asked myself a few questions:

Q:What was the state of the world before the Pragmatic Currencies Proposal?

A:The Mint, as defined by Rule 1470, was the Mintor of VTs.

Q: What changes to the game state were made as a result of this Proposal?

A:Rule 1470 was amended so it no longer defined the Mint and Rule 1696 was
amended to make the Bank the Mintor of VTs.

Q:What were the effects of this change?

A:Since the Mint was no longer defined, it ceased to exist, by Rule 1586.
At the time it ceased to exist, it was the Mintor of VTs. The Bank became
the Mintor of VTs.

Q:Were the VTs destroyed?

Rule 1579 states:

      If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist, or ceases to have
      the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that Currency
      are destroyed, and that Currency ceases to exist.

A:The Mintor of VTs was the Mint.  The Bank ceased to exist.  Therefore,
the Bank, being the Mintor of VTs, ceased to exist, so all VTs were
destroyed.  In my opinion, there was no instant in time when VTs did not
have a Mintor.  R1579, however, states that all units of a Currency are
destroyed "If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist".  It does not state
that they're destroyed "If a Currency does not have a Mintor".  These are
two very different phrases.

Q:Do the rules have authority to "interfere" in the execution of a
proposal?  Do the rules have the authority to stop a proposal in
mid-execution and change the game state?

A:The answer to this question does not alter the judgement of this CFJ.
Whether the rules interfered or not, the Mintor of VTs was destroyed.  The
rules did not make an exception in the case that a new Mintor of VTs was
defined.

I hereby rule that CFJ 933 was correctly judged TRUE.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning pro-Speaker:

My decision on the Appeal of CFJ 933 is to SUSTAIN the original
Judgement, TRUE.

R&A:

First, I agree with Justice Vir that VTs were destroyed even
if the "atomic" paradigm (wherein a Proposal represents only
a single game state change, although the effects of that change
are as if the provisions were applied sequentially) were
the correct one; as well as with his basis for that decision.

As for the question of whether the "atomic" or "sequential"
paradigm is correct, I cannot decide--based on any of the
four preferred standards of Rule 217 (Game Custom, common sense,
past judgements, the best interests of the Game)--and since
I do not need to decide in order to judge this Appeal, I choose
not to.  However, I will make some lengthy comments on my
inability to decide. :)

I began writing these R&A with the intent of coming down
in favor of the sequential model.  Along those lines,
I had written:

>However, I agree with Steve that the annotations and Amendment
>Number of Rule 1551 establish a Game Custom that the "sequential"
>paradigm--wherein each provision of a Proposal is applied
>individually, and the Rules may act on the intermediate
>game states--is the preferred one.  (Rule 1551 counts
>two "amendments" from a single proposal as two distinct
>amendments.)
>
>First, I note that some have argued that even under the
>atomic (or, for that matter, the generally discredited
>simutaneous) paradigm, the two alleged amendments would
>still be two distinct amendments.  With this I disagree.
>"Amendment" is nowhere distinctly defined in the Rules,
>and thus it must have its normal English usage (possibly
>as modified by Game Custom)--which I (intuitively) take
>to mean "a change to the text of a Rule."  Given this
>definition, if the atomic paradigm held, two alleged
>amendments by a single proposal would in fact be
>only one amendment.  

However, I realized there is a flaw in this reasoning.
I will bring it up below, but there is another issue
I wish to address first.

>Second, the possibility has been raised that the Rulekeepor
>was in error in counting the two "amendments" of Rule
>1551 as two actual amendments, and e should have counted
>them as a single amendment.  I reject this argument on
>the grounds that there is no other evidence from the "preferred
>standards" of Rule 217 supporting the atomic view.  If some
>of those preferred standards supported the atomic view,
>then the strength of the Game Custom of the annotations
>and Amendment Number of 1551 would have to be weighed
>against that other evidence.  But given the lack of
>any other evidence, Rule 1551 must be counted as valid
>Game Custom, rather than an error on the Rulekeepor's part.
>(This is also supported, I believe, by Rule 1575, "Standards
>of Proof".)

As I obliquely allude to above, not all Game Customs are
of equal strength.  Rule 217 provides four preferred
standards for judgement but does not (IMO) provide
any sort of order in which those standards should be
applied--a Judge is free to give precedence to whichever
standards e thinks best.  However, one thing a conscientious
Judge ought to consider, in deciding how to apply the
standards, is that some Game Customs are stronger than
other Game Customs.  A Judge might decide, for example,
that a strong Game Custom is to be preferred over common
sense, but common sense is to be preferred over a weak
Game Custom.  (This is a bit of an oversimplification--not
all common sense is equally strong, either.)

I will not go into a detailed dicussion of what constitutes
"strong" versus "weak" Game Custom, but there are two
issues which I believe are relevant.  First, how many
times has the Game Custom been applied?  A Game Custom
applied dozens of times is stronger than one applied only
once or twice.  Second, how carefully has the Game Custom
been scrutinized in the past?  A Game Custom which led to
a win, for example, or a player deregistration, is likely
to have been very carefully scrutinized, and thus is stronger
than a Game Custom with no major effects, which may not
have been closely scrutinized.

Returning to the issue at hand, we find that we have
only a very weak Game Custom supporting the sequential
view--there is only one example (Rule 1551), and amendment
numbers and Rule annotations are not likely to be closely
scrutinized.  However, even a weak Game Custom can
be decisive, if none of the other standards of Rule 217
apply.  There are no (to my knowledge) past judgements
on this issue, and common sense does not seem to prefer
either view over the other.  I personally hold the
"best interests of the game" standard in low regard,
and choose to place even a weak Game Custom above this
standard, but even if I did not, I do not see that
either one of TRUE or FALSE would be better for the
game than the other.

And so I was about to argue that the sequential view was
the correct one, as noted in my first quoted argument,
until I realized the flaw.  (Note that the second
argument, concerning the possibility of Rulekeepor
error, hinges on the first: if the atomic view can
support counting two alleged amendments in a single
proposal as two actual amendments, the second argument
is irrelevant.)

I wrote that since "Amendment" was not clearly defined
in the Rules, it had to be given its normal definition
of "a change to the text of a Rule."  However, this
does not fit with another Game Custom--the custom
that a Null-Amendment is a valid, legal Amendment.
This, IMO, is a moderately strong Game Custom--although
it also resides in the poorly-scrutinized area of
Amendment Numbers and Rule Annotations, it has been applied
many times.  Given this, we cannot define "Amendment"
simply as "a change to the text of a Rule."  A likely
definition is "Any alleged amendment to the text of a
Rule by a Rule or adopted Proposal, not prohibited by
the Rules."  Given this definition, two alleged amendments by a 
single Proposal may be two actual amendments, even under
the atomic view.

Thus, I find no reason to prefer the sequential model to
the atomic, or vice versa, under any of the preferred standards
of Rule 217.  If this CFJ hinged on that issue, I would have
to make a decision based on any other standards I cared to
apply, but since it does not (VTs are destroyed in both
models), I leave the issue to future CFJs (or, perhaps
preferably, legislation).

Rule 1551/4 (Power=1)
Documents Subject to Ratification

      The ratification of an Official Document conforms the Game State
      to what it would be if the valid Official Document thus ratified
      was completely true and accurate at the time of the Document's
      publication in the Public Forum.  In other words, the State of
      the Game, upon such ratification, becomes that specified within
      the Document, plus all subsequent legal changes between the time
      of its publication and its ratification.

      All Game State changes due to the ratification of an Official
      Document occur at the time of such ratification; no retroactive
      effect is expressed or implied.

      A Document, once ratified, is for all legal purposes a true and
      accurate report.  The Game State it references may not be
      retroactively modified prior to the time it was published in the
      Public Forum, even to reflect a prior mistake, retracted or
      illegal move, or an Injunction.  This Rule takes precedence over
      any Rule that would allow such retroactive alterations or
      corrections to the Game State.

      In no way does the ratification of a Document invalidate,
      reverse, alter or cancel any prior moves or transfers, even
      unrecorded or overlooked ones.  Nor does the ratification of a
      Document change the legality or illegality of any prior move.
      Ratification only adjusts the actual Game State to conform to
      that perceived by the Players and Officers in Official
      Documentation.

      After a Document has been ratified, the Player in charge of
      maintaining that Document shall annotate all subsequent
      publications of that Document with the date of publication of
      the last such publication that was ratified..

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Morendil becomes Elde's EiP.
Rule 1738 says that Elde's EiP is eir Executor, so Morendil is Elde's
  Executor and succeeds in reregistering Elde.
Elde becomes Blob's EiP.
By a similar argument, Elde is Blob's Executor and succeeds in reregistering
  Blob.
Elde is deregistered.
No Rule states that a Player who is deregistered loses eir Executor or EiP,
  so Morendil is still Elde's Executor and EiP.
Rule 1478's statement that Executors must be Players takes precedence over
  Rule 1738's claim that Blob's EiP (Elde) is eir Executor, so Elde is no
  longer Blob's Executor.
However, no Rule states that an EiP who is deregistered ceases to be EiP,
  so Elde is still Blob's EiP.

When Elde ceased to be Blob's Executor, e did not cease to be Blob's EiP -
precisely because the equality of EiP and Executor (which exists only
because Rule 1738 says so) is broken by way of Rule 1478 starting to take
precedence over Rule 1738.

(Caller's) Arguments:

Morendil becomes Elde's EiP.
Rule 1738 says that Elde's EiP is eir Executor, so Morendil is Elde's
  Executor and succeeds in reregistering Elde.
Elde becomes Blob's EiP.
By a similar argument, Elde is Blob's Executor and succeeds in reregistering
  Blob.
Elde is deregistered.
No Rule states that a Player who is deregistered loses eir Executor or EiP,
  so Morendil is still Elde's Executor and EiP.
Rule 1478's statement that Executors must be Players takes precedence over
  Rule 1738's claim that Blob's EiP (Elde) is eir Executor, so Elde is no
  longer Blob's Executor.
However, no Rule states that an EiP who is deregistered ceases to be EiP,
  so Elde is still Blob's EiP.

When Elde ceased to be Blob's Executor, e did not cease to be Blob's EiP -
precisely because the equality of EiP and Executor (which exists only
because Rule 1738 says so) is broken by way of Rule 1478 starting to take
precedence over Rule 1738.

============================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

In CFJ 1045, I find the Statement to be TRUE.

I am in essential agreement with the Caller that Rule 1563 provides
more than adequate justification for Dismissing the named CFJs, in
spite of some arduous wording which made it briefly tempting - given
the rewards of returning a Judgement on, rather than Dismiss, these
CFJs - to wriggle my way out of it.


But wait, there is more.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the sum total of
Payment Orders in Indulgences naming that Player as Payor that they
have thus far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the sum total of Payment
Orders in Voting Tokens naming that Player as Payor that they have
thus far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Proposal Notes equal to the sum total of
Payment Orders in Indulgences naming that Player as Payor that they
have thus far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to the Registrar, requiring em to issue, for each Player, a
Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, that Player as Payee, for an
amount of 5 VTs. (So we can Vote on Proposals, y'know...)

The above facially satisfy provisions i) through iv) of Rule 663
pertaining to Injunctions; it is my belief that they also satisfy v), 
though that requires us to examine any Rule relevant thereto. I
find one, Rule 1736 itself, which states

      The Rules may require, in certain cases, that a Judge issue an
      Injunction ordering the execution of a Payment Order.  If the
      Payment Order required by such an Injunction is executed, and
      the Injunction itself later set aside, the Player who executed
      the required Payment Order shall, as soon as possible after the
      Injunction was set aside, vacate that Payment Order.

This merely states that Rules are permitted to require Judges to
issue Injuctions under certain circumstances; it is as far as I can
see no bar to a Judge taking it upon emself to issue any legal
Injuction. No prohibition of any kind in fact obtains with respect
to issuing Injuctions defined in 1736/1737; the procedure for issuing
an Injunction is well delineated, and followed to a T in this
Judgement; issuing an Injunctions in the present circumstances is 
therefore possible and unprohibited, which I submit is all that 'in a 
manner consistent with the Rules' requires.

Lastly, a note as to intent - obviously, this loophole can be used
for massive personal gain (well, once the status of Currencies has
been determined), and just as obviously it will be extremely tempting
for other Players assigned to Judge CFJs to take advantage of it for
the same reasons. It could also be used to summarily deregister 
anyone from the Game by assigning them 31 Blots.

There is no limit to how far this could be abused; if everyone jumps
on that bandwagon, all we will do is spoil the game absolutely.
Better we should fix that loophole, and quick, and refrain from
doing anything else about it for the sake of preserving the game's
fun.

I think the above is even-handed enough that Players (especially
Justices or Judges with CFJs currently assigned to em) will see their
own interest in letting it stand at that.

(And remember, you ain't seen nothing yet.)

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:


Relevant Rules: 1563

Rule 1563/1 (Power=1)
Statement of a CFJ

      In order to be Judged, a Call for Judgement must contain a
      single clearly-labeled Statement which must be able to be
      determined by the means of logical reasoning, with the
      presumption of perfect knowledge, to be either TRUE or FALSE.
      Statements which are inherently contradictory or which are
      vacuous are not acceptable, and a CFJ containing such a
      Statement shall not be Judged.

      If a Call for Judgement does not contain a Statement of the sort
      required by this Rule, its Judge is required to dismiss the CFJ,
      as described elsewhere.

      It is permitted for a Call for Judgement to contain Arguments,
      Evidence, or other material placed there at the Caller's
      discretion.  However, the Judge is not required to take notice
      of any part of the CFJ other than the Statement in formulating
      eir Judgement.

Before I begin arguing, I'd like to say that when I refer to "the
statement", I refer to the statement "This statement is TRUE.", and when I
refer to "the CFJ", I'm referring to the CFJ I am submitting.  I'm keeping
this consistancy so that it's clear what I am talking about.

The statement "This statement is TRUE." cannot be determined to be either
TRUE or FALSE by means of logical reasoning.

If the statement is TRUE, then it follows that the statement is TRUE, and
there's no contradiction.  If the statement is FALSE, then it follows that
the statement is FALSE, and there's no contradiction.  Therefore, the
statement is both TRUE and FALSE and is not either TRUE or FALSE.

The statement is also vacuous, and is therefore not acceptable.

vacuous (vky-es) adjective
1.	Devoid of matter; empty.
2.	a. Lacking intelligence; stupid. b. Devoid of substance or meaning;
inane: a vacuous comment. c. Devoid of expression; vacant: "The narrow,
swinelike eyes were open, no more vacuous in death than they had been in
life" (Nicholas Proffitt).
3.	Lacking serious purpose or occupation; idle. See synonyms at EMPTY.
[From Latin vacuus, empty. See VACUUM.]
- vacuously adverb
- vacuousness noun

The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Third Edition

definitions 2b, 2c, and 3 all support the statement being vacuous.
definition 1 would imply an empty statement, like a null set, but then
there would be no statement to be vacuous, so definition 1 does not apply.
definition 2a is a matter of taste, so it does not apply.

The statement has not substance or meaning in game terms or in terms of
anything other than the statement.

I'd like to also note that this CFJ must be judged TRUE if it is determined
by the judge that the statement cannot be judged TRUE or FALSE by logical
reasoning or the statement is vacuous.  Either one of those being TRUE (or
both being true) makes this CFJ true.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning CotC:

Legality of these Injunctions is a borderline issue, which I will
discuss further on in my Judgement. However, Rule 1695 asks the
Board of Appeals to not only check legality, but also appropriateness
of the Injunction. And this is easy - there is no reasonable
connection between the CFJ and the Injunctions, and thus issuing
these Injunctions with this CFJ's Judgement must be regarded
inappropriate, and the Injunctions (I will not at this place go
into the more difficult issue of their number) must be set aside.

Now for these Injunction's legality. I think these Injunctions fall
short of the fourth point in Rule 663. In my opinion Rule 1736 only
defines Injunctions being the execution of a Payment Order which
are required by the Rules. As Morendil was not required by the
Rules to do so, his Injunctions are not of this type. They are
clearly not of any other type defined by the Rules, so they do
not comply with the prerequisites in Rule 663, and thus are not
legally made.

But anyway, whether they are legally made or not, they are
not appropriate, and thus I ask for setting aside all Judgement.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Speaker:

In accordance with R1695, the Board has been asked to consider the
legality and appropriateness of the Injunctions made by Morendil and
attached to his Judgement of CFJ 1045. In making those Injunctions,
Morendil considered arguments as to their legality; evidently he did
not consider the provisions in R1695 concerning appropriateness. His
omission is, however, our good fortune, for whatever the legal merits
of the Injunctions, and these are debatable, it is plain that the
Injunctions were inappropriate for the situation: they have nothing
whatsoever to do with the matter that Morendil was asked to consider
in his Judgement. R1695 is clear that inappropriate Injunctions are
to be set aside, and my Judgement is that it be so ordered.

This brings us to a far trickier matter: that of penalties. Making an
inappropriate Injunction is an Infraction, the Infraction of Wrongful
Injunction. According to R1695, the penalty for the commission of
this Infraction is 2 Blots. The question is: how many Injunctions did
Morendil Wrongfully make? To answer this difficult question, it will be
useful to have the text of the Injunctions before us:

      I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
      applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for
      every Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and
      that Player as Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the
      sum total of Payment Orders in Indulgences naming that Player
      as Payor that they have thus far executed and have not been
      satisfied.

      I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
      applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for
      every Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and
      that Player as Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the
      sum total of Payment Orders in Voting Tokens naming that Player
      as Payor that they have thus far executed and have not been
      satisfied.

      I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
      applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for
      every Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and
      that Player as Payee, for an amount of Proposal Notes equal to
      the sum total of Payment Orders in Indulgences naming that
      Player as Payor that they have thus far executed and have not
      been satisfied.

      I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
      applying to the Registrar, requiring em to issue, for each
      Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, that Player
      as Payee, for an amount of 5 VTs. (So we can Vote on Proposals,
      y'know...)

It would have been simpler, (and better for Morendil, as we shall
see), had we been able to count this as 4 Injunctions; however, 
the text of the Injunctions did not permit such a reading, as each
paragraph refers to multiple Injunctions. 

Abandoning this strategy, we took up a suggestion by Andre that each
paragraph be interpreted as making one Injunction for each current
Officer. This would have meant 15 Injunctions for each of the first
three paragraphs, and one Injunction in the last paragraph. This
suggestion has remained the heart of our counting strategy, although
we have had to modify it in various ways, described below:

1. It will not do to count the last paragraph as making only one
Injunction, for the same reasons as led us to reject the suggestion
that the first three paragraphs should be understood as each making
only one Injunction, namely, that the last paragraph also refers to
'Injunctions'. However, the last paragraph differs from the other
three in not seeking to enjoin each current Officer, but only the
Registrar.  Since the paragraph seeks to enjoin the Registrar to
issue one Payment Order for each Player, it makes sense to count this
paragraph as making 21 Injunctions on the Registrar, one for each
Player registered at the time the Injunctions were made (Elde had not
yet been deregistered for Lawlessness at that time).

2. It turns out that 15 is too high a count for the number of
Injunctions made in each of the first three paragraphs. R1596
states that:

      A Payment Order specifies exactly one source entity, exactly
      one destination entity, exactly one Currency, and a number of
      units of that Currency which is a positive multiple of that
      Currency's MUQ.

An Officer therefore cannot be enjoined to make a Payment Order
for zero units of a Currency, or at any rate, we choose to interpret
Morendil's Injunctions as not seeking to enjoin Officers to make
such POs. Our attention is therefore focussed on those of the
current Officers who have executed unsatisfied Payment Orders
which name a Player as Payor. The first and third paragraphs
concern POs for Indulgences; the second paragraph concerns POs
for Voting Tokens.

The Board has therefore made enquiries of the Recordkeepors of
Indulgences (Herald Crito), and Voting Tokens (Assessor General
Chaos), seeking answers to those questions. It appears that the
Chancellor, the Assessor, the CotC and the Herald have executed
unsatisfied Payments Orders for Indulgences naming a Player as the
Payor; the only current Officer to have executed an unsatisfied
Payment Order for VTs naming a Player as Payor is the Assessor,
General Chaos.

It would appear, therefore that Morendil wrongfully made 4
Injunctions in the first paragraph, 1 in the second paragraph, 4 in
the third paragraph, and 21 in the last paragraph, for a total of
30 Wrongful Injunctions. He therefore commits the Infraction of
Wrongful Injunction 30 times, and earns 60 Blots, which penalty is to
be detected and reported by the Clerk of the Courts.

Steve (Speaker)

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Justiciar:

Decision of the Justiciar:  All the Injunctions were incorrect and should
be set aside.


I believe that the Injunctions are all illegal. Judge Morendil claims that
his authority to issue the Injunctions is implied by Rule 1736 which says,
in part

      The Rules may require, in certain cases, that a Judge issue an
      Injunction ordering the execution of a Payment Order.

But I do not see how to get from this to saying that a Judge may issue PO's
in all cases.  "Certain cases" seems to need specifying by the Rules.
Absent this, it seems impossible for the Judge to establish that this is
one of the "certain cases" where he can issue a legal injunction.

Moreover, even if any of the Injunctions were technically legal, Rule 1695
asks us to consider whether the injunction was both legal and appropriate.

      If the Board finds that the Injunction was made illegally,
      or that it was inappropriate for the situation, the
      Injunction shall be set aside.

It is clear that the Injunctions were all inappropriate for the situation
of the CFJ.  "Appropriate for the situation," in the clear sense of the
Rule, would mean that the injunction was a natural and expected result of
the Statement being found TRUE.  In this case there is simply no reasonable
way to connect the Statement (that CFJs 945-970 and 972-1044 must be
dismissed under Rule 1563) to the Injunctions (that various Officers
distribute currencies to the masses).


I therefore find that all these Injunctions were made illegally, and/or
were inappropriate for the situation.  Accordingly they should all be set
aside.


How many injunctions are there?

Looking at the actual wording of the Injunctions, there is a clear
presumption that each paragraph refer to more than one injunction, as they
begin "I hereby issue Injuctions..." (plural).  We agree that the most
natural reading of the first 3 Injunctions is to count one Injunction for
each current Officer who has issued a Payment Order of the kind described.
For the last injunction we prefer the reading of counting one Injunction
per Player, or 21 Injunctions.

Three Officers have written PO's from players in Indulgences: General
Chaos, Andre, and Crito.

One current Officer has written a PO from a player in Voting Tokens:
Assessor General Chaos (in a PO which is now vacated).

This makes 3 + 1 + 3 + 21 = 28 injunctions overturned.  For each of these,
in the words of Rule 1695, "the original Judge is guilty of the Infraction
of Wrongful Injunction, the penalty for which is 2 Blots; the CotC shall
detect and report this penalty."

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1563/1 (Power=1)
Statement of a CFJ

      In order to be Judged, a Call for Judgement must contain a
      single clearly-labeled Statement which must be able to be
      determined by the means of logical reasoning, with the
      presumption of perfect knowledge, to be either TRUE or FALSE.
      Statements which are inherently contradictory or which are
      vacuous are not acceptable, and a CFJ containing such a
      Statement shall not be Judged.

      If a Call for Judgement does not contain a Statement of the sort
      required by this Rule, its Judge is required to dismiss the CFJ,
      as described elsewhere.

      It is permitted for a Call for Judgement to contain Arguments,
      Evidence, or other material placed there at the Caller's
      discretion.  However, the Judge is not required to take notice
      of any part of the CFJ other than the Statement in formulating
      eir Judgement.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 663/6 (Power=1)
Injunctions--General

      A Judge is permitted to issue orders requiring one or more
      Players to perform, or refrain from performing, one or more
      actions.  Such an order is called an Injunction.

       To be legally made, an Injunction must:

        i) Specify the Player(s) to whom it applies.
       ii) Specify the action(s) the Player(s) are required to perform
           or refrain from performing.
      iii) Either be attached to a legally made Judgement at the time
           that Judgement is originally delivered to the Cotc, or be
           legally made by the Board of Appeals in an Appeal of an
           Injunction.
       iv) Be of a type explicitly defined in the Rules.
        v) Be issued in a manner consistent with the Rules.

      An Injunction which does not meet these criteria has no effect.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1695/1 (Power=1)
Appeal of an Injunction

      If an Injuction issued with a Judgement is Appealed, the
      Board shall consider the legality and appropriateness of

Injunctions on Payment Orders

      The Rules may require, in certain cases, that a Judge issue an
      Injunction ordering the execution of a Payment Order.  If the
      Payment Order required by such an Injunction is executed, and
      the Injunction itself later set aside, the Player who executed
      the required Payment Order shall, as soon as possible after the
      Injunction was set aside, vacate that Payment Order.

Appeals decisions

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Justice elJefe's decision: SUSTAIN

                              CFJ 930

"No Payment Orders have thus far been successfully executed, for the
 reason that none exist."

Judge Chuck relied on the reasoning of CFJ 929:

However, at the time of the CFJ, only one Transfer Order could have
been submitted, namely the Chancellor's transfer of 9 Indulgences
from the Bank to Elde. At that time the Mint (which was Mintor of
Indulgences) no longer had Mint Authority due to the effects of
Proposal 3533. Thus Indulgences ceased to exist as a Currency by
Rule 1579, and so the Chancellor's posting, not referring to any
Currency, was not a Transfer Order.

The only point in dispute is whether Indulgences continued to exist as
a currency after the adoption of Proposal 3533.  If they did then the
reasoning in the quoted paragraph of CFJ 929 is correct and the
judgement of TRUE stands.  If not then the judgement in both CFJs
should be FALSE, since the Misanthropists' currencies failed to
confuse itself with Payment Orders or Transfer Orders defined in the
Rules.

Quoting from Rule 1579: "If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist,
or ceases to have the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that
Currency are destroyed, and that Currency ceases to exist."  There is
unchallenged evidence that the old Mintor for Indulgences ceased to
exist, and that no new Mintor was designated.  Therefore unless this
conflicts with some higher-power Rule, it must be applied.

Rule 1435 begins "Indulgences are a Currency."  One possible
interpretation is that Indulgences were destroyed and ceased to exist
at a given instant; but then immediately after that R1435
re-established Indulgences as a Currency without a Mintor, which then
is immune to R1579 since it has no Mintor which can either cease
existing or lose Mint authority. (*)

This has several things wrong with it.  Rule 1435 is silent as to
whether Indulgences have a Mintor or not, so there is no conflict on
this point with R1579.  Thus any "re-establishment" of the currency
must follow the first sentence of R1579, which insists that each
Currency has a Mintor.

Further, the whole notion does not give sufficient respect to the
natural meaning of "cease to exist".  A rule mandating that something
ceases to exist does not mean for the thing to have its existence
interrupted temporarily and then re-appear.  If R1579 is strong enough
to destroy Indulgences (or P-notes) as a currency, then it is strong
enough to keep them destroyed.

This brings us to the central question: _is_ R1579 strong enough to do
what it says?  Well, does it conflict with R1435?  No.  R1435 simply
says that Indulgences are a Currency; R1579 says that they are in fact
a destroyed Currency. (**) This is similar to the repeal of a Rule;
longstanding Game Custom holds that a Rule or Proposal which repeals
another Rule is not for that sole reason in conflict with it. (***)
Thus 1579 did cause Indulgences to cease to exist, and they still
cease to exist to the present time.

NOTES:

(*) This possibility was raised during the discussion of the issues
surrounding a similar situation with regards to P-notes, so it is as
well to dispose of it here.

(**) My fellow learned Justice Michael objected that an earlier
version involves a "secret" insertion of "defunct" into the rule.
This wording is what I meant.

(***) My fellow learned Justice Michael also objected here, pointing
out that Rules and Rule changes occupy separate worlds.  But I feel
this misses the point of my analogy: a Rule Change (proposed or
unproposed) is effective only by virtue of Rules that allow it to take
effect.  Do those Rules (which affect the content of the Ruleset)
actually _conflict_ with the Rule being repealed?

This would be like having an implicit clause in each Rule that stated
"This rule may not be repealed"; game custom says it does not.
Similarly, Rule 1479 does not contain an implied "this currency may
not be destroyed" as part of its defining sentence.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Justice Michael's decision: OVERTURN/reverse

If Indulgences exist, then a Payment Order was executed by the
Chancellor when he attempted to transfer 9 Indulgences from the Bank
to Elde.

If Indulgences exist, then the Indulgence Currency's Recordkeepor is
authorised to record and execute Payment Orders (R1596).

Thus, if Indulgences exist, the correct judgement for this CFJ is
FALSE.

The argument that Indulgences do not exist is based on R1579, which
states that all Currencies have a Mintor and if a Currency should lose
its Mintor, then it is destroyed.  It is accepted that an entity known
as the Mint was the Mintor for Indulgences before the Pragmatic
Currencies reform occurred.

By virtue of R1586, we must also accept that the Mint no longer
exists, so it would appear that the antecedent of the conditional
sentence of the second paragraph in R1597 holds.  So, what might
prevent Indulgences from being destroyed, as required by R1579?

The answer is the precedence taking R1435.  This states that
"Indulgences are a Currency".  This statement must remain true,
whatever R1579 says to the contrary.  My Fellow Justice elJefe claims
that this is possible if one reads "Indulgences are a Currency" as
"Indulgences are a destroyed Currency".

This is a senseless contortion.  We do not need to put the rules
through such hoops.  We have rules taking precedence over each other
all the time.  When we read "Indulgences are a Currency", we know that
this is equivalent to stating that there exists a Currency whose name
is "Indulgences".  But now the opposing argument wants us to
simultaneously read this as admitting the precise opposite, that this
Currency doesn't exist at all.

I refuse to make the Rules play such tricks.  If a high precedence
rule says that Indulgences exist, then the lower precedence R1579 can
yammer on about Mintors and the lack thereof all it likes.

Indulgences exist.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

You would prefer that I ignore the obvious and direct meaning as
being a Transfer Order for 4 VTs in favor of the less obvious,
indirect meaning as being 2 Transfer Orders for 2 VTs each? 
Please. COE denied.  Further, I transfer one Kudo from Morendil for
making such a baseless COE, to Harlequin, for being the unfortunate
victim of circumstance. 

For one thing, that is precisely what I expect you to do - the Courts
have been working overtime to establish that implicit specifications
in the wording of Orders were to be given due consideration, and
Harlequin's request for a transfer is worded so that it was well
within your authority, given this judicial basis, to interpret it as
two successful distinct TOs. Note that Harlequin's request did not
purport to be one TO for 4 VTs, but merely requested that you note a
Transfer or Transfers for a total of 4 VTs; given that the POs this
aimed to satisfy were explicitly listed, your contention that the
'obvious and direct' intent was as a TO for an amount of 4 VTs
simply makes no sense.

For another thing, "unfortunate victim of circumstance", together
with your statement that "The Bank gratefully appreciates your
donation", strikes me as very cynical.

I'll let the Agoran community take appropriate steps, if they so
wish, to compensate for the injurious Kudo transfer above; however,
your behaviour as an Officer should be subject to formal scrutiny
and I therefore submit the following CFJ :

===
General Chaos committed the Crime of Wrongful COE denial.
===

======================================================================

Reasons and arguments Judge:

This Judge finds that, in stating that Harlequin's message "I transfer
4 VTs to the Bank, to satisfy VT POs 1040 and 1041" failed to satisfy
payment orders VT1040 and VT1041, and then denying a COE asserting the
opposite, General Chaos committed the Crime of Wrongful COE denial.

As the caller of the CFJ claims, it is legitimate to interpret
statements such as Harlequin's generously, to wit that the transfer
made be considered two separate Transfer Orders, one for each of the
two Payment Orders he was required to satisfy. 

This is in line with recent judicial (and appelate) decisions which
allow Transfer and Payment Orders to be made implicitly, and
represents a welcome shift towards a less pedantic style of play.

Michael.

Actually, Scott has already appealed it. And so, hereby, do I. Now 
unless someone else steps forward, I guess Elde or Blob might do 
that...

For the same reason given in my last mail I would also like to make
myself ineligible to judge the recent CFJ called by Morendil ("General
Chaos committed the Crime of Wrongful COE denial") according to 1567.

I am afraid that a long as I don't go on hold I'll have to do this
separately for each new CFJ, according to the wording of 1567, right?
Sorry for the extra work involved.

If you accept that, it will make life much easier, so I hereby request
being made ineligible this way. We don't need "further notice",
though: I'll be back on 15th October, so after that I'll be happy to
judge again.

Attention: This CFJ contains a large number of Injunctions, concerning
many players.

======================================================================
                               CFJ 1045

  CFJs 945-970 and 972-1044 do not contain a statement of the sort
      required by rule 1563, and as such, must be dismissed.

======================================================================

Judge:       Morendil

Judgement:   TRUE

Eligible:    Andre, Blob, Calabresi, ChrisM, Chuck, Crito, Elde, 
	     elJefe, General Chaos, Harlequin, Michael, Morendil,
             Murphy, Oerjan, Steve, Vir, Vlad, Zefram

Not eligible:
Caller:      Kolja A.
Barred:

======================================================================

History:
  Called by Kolja A., Sep 23 21:26:10 1997
  Assigned to Morendil, 23 Sep 1997 21:36:11 +0200 (MET DST)
  Judged TRUE by Morendil, 30 Sep 1997 17:51:10 +0100

============================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

In CFJ 1045, I find the Statement to be TRUE.

I am in essential agreement with the Caller that Rule 1563 provides
more than adequate justification for Dismissing the named CFJs, in
spite of some arduous wording which made it briefly tempting - given
the rewards of returning a Judgement on, rather than Dismiss, these
CFJs - to wriggle my way out of it.


But wait, there is more.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the sum total of
Payment Orders in Indulgences naming that Player as Payor that they
have thus far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the sum total of Payment
Orders in Voting Tokens naming that Player as Payor that they have
thus far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Proposal Notes equal to the sum total of
Payment Orders in Indulgences naming that Player as Payor that they
have thus far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to the Registrar, requiring em to issue, for each Player, a
Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, that Player as Payee, for an
amount of 5 VTs. (So we can Vote on Proposals, y'know...)

The above facially satisfy provisions i) through iv) of Rule 663
pertaining to Injunctions; it is my belief that they also satisfy v), 
though that requires us to examine any Rule relevant thereto. I
find one, Rule 1736 itself, which states

      The Rules may require, in certain cases, that a Judge issue an
      Injunction ordering the execution of a Payment Order.  If the
      Payment Order required by such an Injunction is executed, and
      the Injunction itself later set aside, the Player who executed
      the required Payment Order shall, as soon as possible after the
      Injunction was set aside, vacate that Payment Order.

This merely states that Rules are permitted to require Judges to
issue Injuctions under certain circumstances; it is as far as I can
see no bar to a Judge taking it upon emself to issue any legal
Injuction. No prohibition of any kind in fact obtains with respect
to issuing Injuctions defined in 1736/1737; the procedure for issuing
an Injunction is well delineated, and followed to a T in this
Judgement; issuing an Injunctions in the present circumstances is 
therefore possible and unprohibited, which I submit is all that 'in a 
manner consistent with the Rules' requires.

Lastly, a note as to intent - obviously, this loophole can be used
for massive personal gain (well, once the status of Currencies has
been determined), and just as obviously it will be extremely tempting
for other Players assigned to Judge CFJs to take advantage of it for
the same reasons. It could also be used to summarily deregister 
anyone from the Game by assigning them 31 Blots.

There is no limit to how far this could be abused; if everyone jumps
on that bandwagon, all we will do is spoil the game absolutely.
Better we should fix that loophole, and quick, and refrain from
doing anything else about it for the sake of preserving the game's
fun.

I think the above is even-handed enough that Players (especially
Justices or Judges with CFJs currently assigned to em) will see their
own interest in letting it stand at that.

(And remember, you ain't seen nothing yet.)

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:


Relevant Rules: 1563

Rule 1563/1 (Power=1)
Statement of a CFJ

      In order to be Judged, a Call for Judgement must contain a
      single clearly-labeled Statement which must be able to be
      determined by the means of logical reasoning, with the
      presumption of perfect knowledge, to be either TRUE or FALSE.
      Statements which are inherently contradictory or which are
      vacuous are not acceptable, and a CFJ containing such a
      Statement shall not be Judged.

      If a Call for Judgement does not contain a Statement of the sort
      required by this Rule, its Judge is required to dismiss the CFJ,
      as described elsewhere.

      It is permitted for a Call for Judgement to contain Arguments,
      Evidence, or other material placed there at the Caller's
      discretion.  However, the Judge is not required to take notice
      of any part of the CFJ other than the Statement in formulating
      eir Judgement.

Before I begin arguing, I'd like to say that when I refer to "the
statement", I refer to the statement "This statement is TRUE.", and when I
refer to "the CFJ", I'm referring to the CFJ I am submitting.  I'm keeping
this consistancy so that it's clear what I am talking about.

The statement "This statement is TRUE." cannot be determined to be either
TRUE or FALSE by means of logical reasoning.

If the statement is TRUE, then it follows that the statement is TRUE, and
there's no contradiction.  If the statement is FALSE, then it follows that
the statement is FALSE, and there's no contradiction.  Therefore, the
statement is both TRUE and FALSE and is not either TRUE or FALSE.

The statement is also vacuous, and is therefore not acceptable.

vacuous (vky-es) adjective
1.	Devoid of matter; empty.
2.	a. Lacking intelligence; stupid. b. Devoid of substance or meaning;
inane: a vacuous comment. c. Devoid of expression; vacant: "The narrow,
swinelike eyes were open, no more vacuous in death than they had been in
life" (Nicholas Proffitt).
3.	Lacking serious purpose or occupation; idle. See synonyms at EMPTY.
[From Latin vacuus, empty. See VACUUM.]
- vacuously adverb
- vacuousness noun

The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Third Edition
copyright  1992 by Houghton Mifflin Company. Electronic version licensed
from InfoSoft International, Inc. All rights reserved.

definitions 2b, 2c, and 3 all support the statement being vacuous.
definition 1 would imply an empty statement, like a null set, but then
there would be no statement to be vacuous, so definition 1 does not apply.
definition 2a is a matter of taste, so it does not apply.

The statement has not substance or meaning in game terms or in terms of
anything other than the statement.

I'd like to also note that this CFJ must be judged TRUE if it is determined
by the judge that the statement cannot be judged TRUE or FALSE by logical
reasoning or the statement is vacuous.  Either one of those being TRUE (or
both being true) makes this CFJ true.

16      Jul. 1997 - Aug. 1997

When I replace those >200 events (I assume these are chromatic repeals
and Crito's Scam, all of which are discouraged under our current
system) with the average of the neighboring months, I get
approximately

40 + 110 + 149 + 87 + 39 + 33 + 21 + 36 + 29 + 28 + 55 + 20 + 53 +
56.5 + 60 + 3 + 47 + 39 + 83 + 47 + 12 + 17 + 31 + 44 + 36 + 55 + 55 +
44 + 44 + 54 + 63 + 25 + 30 + 13 + 18 + 10 + 28 + 53 + 34 + 11 + 21 +
26 + 20.5 + 15 + 30 + 30 + 16

= 1871 Proposals.

dividing this by 4*52 gives 9 Proposals per week on average.

Assuming a Poisson distribution this gives (now where is my statistics
table?) (starting up MapleV) (repeated tries)

> add(evalf((9^i)/i!*exp(-9))*min(8,floor(i*2/3)),i=0..100);
                                  5.533333273

5.5333 VTs per week in average Voting stipend.

>From a recent Salary Report (Zefram, 23 Sep 1997) I see that the total
amount of Officer Salaries in the game is

2.0+1.0+3.0+1.0+1.0+2.0+1.0+1.0+1.0+1.5+1.5+2.0+1.0
= 19 VT per Week.

There are, according to the most recent Registrar's Report, 20 Active
Players.  This means a Voting stipend total of 110 VTs per Week.

With half the Players being Officers this implies a VT distribution of
slightly above 4:3 between Officers:Others.

This seems low in my opinion. 3:2 would be more reasonable. To achieve
this, salaries could be increased to a total of 110/4 = 27.5 VTs.

Dividing this amount by 13 Offices gives an average of 2.1 VTs per
Officer. This is approximately the CotC's current salary.

Looking at Michael's "recent CFJs" report, I see
CFJ 929 (called on Wed, 16 Jul 1997 08:47:14 +0100)
CFJ 872 (called on 21 May 1996 05:45 UTC)
These are 60 weeks apart, and 57 apart in number.
So there is about 1 CFJ per week.

I would estimate the following Officers to have a higher workload than the
CotC:

Archivist (archives all posts to the PF, and treat some specially)
Assessor (handles all Proposals + VTs)
Chancellor (handles a lot of transactions)
Herald (handles Kudos + Indulgences)
Promotor (handles all Proposals + PNs)
Rulekeepor (must react to many Proposals + the Virus)

These are borderline:

Registrar
Wizard

and the following seem to have lower workload:

Ambassador (Internomic is slow-moving at best)
Cartographor (people don't move that often)
Mad Scientist (although produces report, has a solitary job)
Notary (data change rarely)

The CotC seems to be an average Office, and so should have an average
Salary.

Therefore, I Judge FALSE.

Greetings,
Oerjan.

At least when there are some VTs in the Bank, they'll have someplace 
to go - judicial salaries, y'know : -)

Appeals decisions

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Justice elJefe's decision: SUSTAIN

                              CFJ 930

"No Payment Orders have thus far been successfully executed, for the
 reason that none exist."

Judge Chuck relied on the reasoning of CFJ 929:

However, at the time of the CFJ, only one Transfer Order could have
been submitted, namely the Chancellor's transfer of 9 Indulgences
from the Bank to Elde. At that time the Mint (which was Mintor of
Indulgences) no longer had Mint Authority due to the effects of
Proposal 3533. Thus Indulgences ceased to exist as a Currency by
Rule 1579, and so the Chancellor's posting, not referring to any
Currency, was not a Transfer Order.

The only point in dispute is whether Indulgences continued to exist as
a currency after the adoption of Proposal 3533.  If they did then the
reasoning in the quoted paragraph of CFJ 929 is correct and the
judgement of TRUE stands.  If not then the judgement in both CFJs
should be FALSE, since the Misanthropists' currencies failed to
confuse itself with Payment Orders or Transfer Orders defined in the
Rules.

Quoting from Rule 1579: "If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist,
or ceases to have the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that
Currency are destroyed, and that Currency ceases to exist."  There is
unchallenged evidence that the old Mintor for Indulgences ceased to
exist, and that no new Mintor was designated.  Therefore unless this
conflicts with some higher-power Rule, it must be applied.

Rule 1435 begins "Indulgences are a Currency."  One possible
interpretation is that Indulgences were destroyed and ceased to exist
at a given instant; but then immediately after that R1435
re-established Indulgences as a Currency without a Mintor, which then
is immune to R1579 since it has no Mintor which can either cease
existing or lose Mint authority. (*)

This has several things wrong with it.  Rule 1435 is silent as to
whether Indulgences have a Mintor or not, so there is no conflict on
this point with R1579.  Thus any "re-establishment" of the currency
must follow the first sentence of R1579, which insists that each
Currency has a Mintor.

Further, the whole notion does not give sufficient respect to the
natural meaning of "cease to exist".  A rule mandating that something
ceases to exist does not mean for the thing to have its existence
interrupted temporarily and then re-appear.  If R1579 is strong enough
to destroy Indulgences (or P-notes) as a currency, then it is strong
enough to keep them destroyed.

This brings us to the central question: _is_ R1579 strong enough to do
what it says?  Well, does it conflict with R1435?  No.  R1435 simply
says that Indulgences are a Currency; R1579 says that they are in fact
a destroyed Currency. (**) This is similar to the repeal of a Rule;
longstanding Game Custom holds that a Rule or Proposal which repeals
another Rule is not for that sole reason in conflict with it. (***)
Thus 1579 did cause Indulgences to cease to exist, and they still
cease to exist to the present time.

NOTES:

(*) This possibility was raised during the discussion of the issues
surrounding a similar situation with regards to P-notes, so it is as
well to dispose of it here.

(**) My fellow learned Justice Michael objected that an earlier
version involves a "secret" insertion of "defunct" into the rule.
This wording is what I meant.

(***) My fellow learned Justice Michael also objected here, pointing
out that Rules and Rule changes occupy separate worlds.  But I feel
this misses the point of my analogy: a Rule Change (proposed or
unproposed) is effective only by virtue of Rules that allow it to take
effect.  Do those Rules (which affect the content of the Ruleset)
actually _conflict_ with the Rule being repealed?

This would be like having an implicit clause in each Rule that stated
"This rule may not be repealed"; game custom says it does not.
Similarly, Rule 1479 does not contain an implied "this currency may
not be destroyed" as part of its defining sentence.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Justice Michael's decision: OVERTURN/reverse

If Indulgences exist, then a Payment Order was executed by the
Chancellor when he attempted to transfer 9 Indulgences from the Bank
to Elde.

If Indulgences exist, then the Indulgence Currency's Recordkeepor is
authorised to record and execute Payment Orders (R1596).

Thus, if Indulgences exist, the correct judgement for this CFJ is
FALSE.

The argument that Indulgences do not exist is based on R1579, which
states that all Currencies have a Mintor and if a Currency should lose
its Mintor, then it is destroyed.  It is accepted that an entity known
as the Mint was the Mintor for Indulgences before the Pragmatic
Currencies reform occurred.

By virtue of R1586, we must also accept that the Mint no longer
exists, so it would appear that the antecedent of the conditional
sentence of the second paragraph in R1597 holds.  So, what might
prevent Indulgences from being destroyed, as required by R1579?

The answer is the precedence taking R1435.  This states that
"Indulgences are a Currency".  This statement must remain true,
whatever R1579 says to the contrary.  My Fellow Justice elJefe claims
that this is possible if one reads "Indulgences are a Currency" as
"Indulgences are a destroyed Currency".

This is a senseless contortion.  We do not need to put the rules
through such hoops.  We have rules taking precedence over each other
all the time.  When we read "Indulgences are a Currency", we know that
this is equivalent to stating that there exists a Currency whose name
is "Indulgences".  But now the opposing argument wants us to
simultaneously read this as admitting the precise opposite, that this
Currency doesn't exist at all.

I refuse to make the Rules play such tricks.  If a high precedence
rule says that Indulgences exist, then the lower precedence R1579 can
yammer on about Mintors and the lack thereof all it likes.

Indulgences exist.

Actually, Scott has already appealed it. And so, hereby, do I. Now 
unless someone else steps forward, I guess Elde or Blob might do 
that...

(Caller's) Arguments:

Rule 1513 ends with this text:

     Especially, no body of text is permitted to require Players to
     perform or not perform any actions unless said body of text has
     previously been made available to that Player.

This says "Text T can bind Player P only if P has read T"; it does not
say "Text T can bind Player P only if the Rules require that P can
receive a copy of T".

======================================================================

Decision and Reasoning Judge:

I Judge the Statement TRUE. Clearly any body of text that a Player has
read has been made available to that Player, under any definition of
what it means to be 'made available'. I don't necessarily accept the
suggestion made by the Caller that having been read by the Player is
a necessary condition for a text to have been made available to that
Player, but it certainly is sufficient.

Attention Rulekeepor! This CFJ contains an Injunction to annotate
a Rule!

======================================================================

                               CFJ 939

The provision in R1504 which states that:

      Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their
      legal report, and the Player making the report of the Infraction
      shall execute whatever Payment Order(s) are required to apply
      the penalty specified for that Infraction. 

should be interpreted such that penalties for Infractions are applied
immediately upon the legal report of the *penalties*, not the legal
report of the Infractions.

======================================================================

Judge:       Zefram

Judgement:   TRUE

Eligible:    Antimatter, Blob, Calabresi, ChrisM, Chuck, Elde, elJefe,

Not eligible:

On hold:     Swann

Injunction:

 The Rulekeepor is hereby commanded to annotate R1504 with the statement
 and the list of relevant Rules.

  Judged TRUE by Zefram, 16 Sep 1997 09:59:01 +0100

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

I reproduce as my argument the one I gave for the same conclusion
in my Judgement of CFJ 937:

"It's worth commenting at this point on an ambiguity in R1504: it's
not clear whether the report of the Infraction and the report of the
gain in Blots have to be made in the same message, or whether the
report of gain in Blots can follow the report of the Infraction by up
to seven days. The first sentence [sic] of R1504 states that
"Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their legal
report". But the legal report of what: the penalties or the
infractions? If infractions is meant, R1504 is somewhat in tension
with itself, since it immediately goes on to imply (along with other
Rules, eg R1599) that the application of the penalty can be later
than the report of the Infraction. So I read R1504 as saying that
penalties for Infractions are applied at the time the penalty is
reported, which can be later than the time the Infraction is reported."

Requested Injunction:

I request that the Judge of the CFJ issue an Injunction requesting
the Rulekeepor to annotate R1504 with the statement and the list
of relevant Rules below, as e is permitted to do by R789.

Relevant Rules: 1504, 1599

====================================================================

Judge's Reasoning:

The first clause of the provision in question says

      Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their
      legal report

As a native English speaker, I have no hesitation in interpreting the
word "their" in this context to refer to "Penalties for Infractions".
The alternative interpretation, with the antecedent being "Infractions",
is a less natural (though still valid) construct.  Given such an
ambiguity, the more natural interpretation of the language must be used.

annotate a Rule!

======================================================================
                               CFJ 940

Rule 1596 should be interpreted so that a message purporting to
be a Payment Order must, in order to satisfy that Rule's requirements
and qualify as a legal Payment Order, explicitly and unambiguously
state that the purported Payor is ordered to effect a payment as
a consequence of that message, e.g. by stating "Player X is commanded
to pay Y", the mere mention of an amount of a Currency, the name or
names of the Payor and Payee, or a reference to some Rule or some
situation that requires a Payment Order to be executed being
insufficient for a message not containing such a command or entreaty
to qualify as a Payment Order.

  Judged TRUE by Chuck, 14 Sep 1997, 16:11 CDT

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

I believe this follows from Rule 1596's definition of a Payment Order
as "an order requiring an entity to" perform some action, and that no
message not framed as a command is a legal Payment Order.

Note that the claim that a particular message _is_ a Payment Order
is by that reasoning sufficient to satisfy Rule 1596's requirement.

I kindly request that the Judge of the CFJ enjoin the Rulekeepor to
annotate R1596 with the above statement and the list of relevant
Rules which follows : 1596.

======================================================================\

Decision and Reasoning Judge:

I judge this statement to be TRUE.

Injunction:
I hereby enjoin the Rulekeepor to annotate Rule 1596
with the statement and list of relevant Rules of this CFJ.

Reasons and Arguments:
I agree with the Caller's arguments.

                               CFJ 941

All proposed Amendments to the Frankenstein Rule were made impossible
by the Frankenstein Generator when the change to the Frankenstein
Monster assigned to "Week 1", reported by the Mad Scientist on Mon,
11 August 1997, took effect.

  Judged FALSE by Vlad, 16 Sep 1997 00:16 -0500 (CDT)

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

The Frankenstein Generator, 1672, requires among other things that 

      vii) All proposed Amendments to the Frankenstein Rule must
           consist of a single sentence of additional text specifying
           the properties and effects of a Frankenstein Monster, to be
           inserted between the first and last paragraphs.

However, the Frankenstein Monster, at the time specified in the
statement, contained the sentence

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Frankenstein Monster 
      is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing 
      the Frankenstein Monsters, which is permitted only when a 
      Frankenstein Monster or set of Frankenstein Monsters explicitly
      or implicitly permits it.

It did not, however, contain any explicit or implicit permissions
permitting such changes.

The introduction of additional text "specifying the properties and
effects of a Frankenstein Monster" is equivalent to "changing the
Frankenstein Monsters". So the FM prohibits the only proposed
amendments to the FR allowed by the FG.
(Note that amendments that change nothing are excluded by point

       vi) No Amendment can be applied to the Frankenstein Rule that
           is substantially the same as any prior successfully applied
           Amendment to the Frankenstein Rule.

of 1672)

Admittedly, this argument has two ossible weaknesses: The equivalence
stated in the preceding paragraph may be challenged. But I consider
this equivalence to hold - let the judge decide for emself.

And the FM also contains the sentence

      A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.

But I would say that, while the FM is permitted to define such
mechanisms, it doesn't actually do it, so this sentence establishes no
explicit or implicit permission to change the FM, after all.

======================================================================

Decision & Arguments Judge:

I find the Statement FALSE.

The Caller's arguments included the following:

It did not, however, contain any explicit or implicit permissions

------------------------

However, the Frankenstein Rule does contain the following clause:

A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.
---------------

"Any change to a Frankenstein Monster adopted in accordance with its
own mechanisms is legal." Now, in the absence of any clearly specified
mechanisms, is a given Amendment in accordance with them or not? Well,
your mileage may differ, but I consider this to be almost trivially true.
One cannot be in conflict with a non-existent law. Therefore, I declare
that (as of this time), the Frankenstein Monster gives implicit
permission to change itself.

I hereby make a COE on this Statement of mine. Elde's Judgement has not

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

As Oerjan pointed out, there was an instant of time when Voting Tokens
also ceased to have a Mintor.

=====================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

In CFJ 933, Elde Judges the Statement to be TRUE.

The reasons for thinking so are briefly outlined as follows :

* before 3533 passed, the Mint was a Nomic Entity
* the Mint was defined by Rule 1470
* 3533 amended 1470 so that it no longer defined the Mint
* by Rule 1586, the Mint ceased to exist
* at that time, the Mintor of VTs was still the Mint (1696)
* by Rule 1579, all VTs were therefore destroyed at that instant
* (thereafter, 1696 was amended to make the Bank the VT Mintor)

Rule 1579 stated :

      If the designated Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist or ceases
      to possess Mint Authority, all units of that Currency are
      destroyed and the Currency ceases to exist.

It has been suggested that Rule 1579 was at that time in conflict 
with Rule 1471, which stated

      The Mintor of a Currency may, at any time, destroy those units
      of that Currency which it currently possesses in its Treasury,
      so long as this destruction is permitted by the Rules.  Units of
      Currency may not be otherwise destroyed except as specifically
      authorized by the Rules.

separate support for this position being sought from this provision 
in Rule 1467 :

      Neither Currencies nor units of Currency shall be created or
      destroyed except as specified by the Rules.

It must be noted that Rule 1579's provisions both authorize, and
specify the manner of, the destruction of units of any Currency
falling under its purview; therefore, no conflict exists, precisely
because of both 1467's and 1471's conflict-avoiding provisions.

Appeals decisions

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Justice elJefe's decision: SUSTAIN

>                               CFJ 930

> "No Payment Orders have thus far been successfully executed, for the
>  reason that none exist."

Judge Chuck relied on the reasoning of CFJ 929:

> However, at the time of the CFJ, only one Transfer Order could have
> been submitted, namely the Chancellor's transfer of 9 Indulgences
> from the Bank to Elde. At that time the Mint (which was Mintor of
> Indulgences) no longer had Mint Authority due to the effects of
> Proposal 3533. Thus Indulgences ceased to exist as a Currency by
> Rule 1579, and so the Chancellor's posting, not referring to any
> Currency, was not a Transfer Order.

The only point in dispute is whether Indulgences continued to exist as
a currency after the adoption of Proposal 3533.  If they did then the
reasoning in the quoted paragraph of CFJ 929 is correct and the
judgement of TRUE stands.  If not then the judgement in both CFJs
should be FALSE, since the Misanthropists' currencies failed to
confuse itself with Payment Orders or Transfer Orders defined in the
Rules.

Quoting from Rule 1579: "If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist,
or ceases to have the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that
Currency are destroyed, and that Currency ceases to exist."  There is
unchallenged evidence that the old Mintor for Indulgences ceased to
exist, and that no new Mintor was designated.  Therefore unless this
conflicts with some higher-power Rule, it must be applied.

Rule 1435 begins "Indulgences are a Currency."  One possible
interpretation is that Indulgences were destroyed and ceased to exist
at a given instant; but then immediately after that R1435
re-established Indulgences as a Currency without a Mintor, which then
is immune to R1579 since it has no Mintor which can either cease
existing or lose Mint authority. (*)

This has several things wrong with it.  Rule 1435 is silent as to
whether Indulgences have a Mintor or not, so there is no conflict on
this point with R1579.  Thus any "re-establishment" of the currency
must follow the first sentence of R1579, which insists that each
Currency has a Mintor.

Further, the whole notion does not give sufficient respect to the
natural meaning of "cease to exist".  A rule mandating that something
ceases to exist does not mean for the thing to have its existence
interrupted temporarily and then re-appear.  If R1579 is strong enough
to destroy Indulgences (or P-notes) as a currency, then it is strong
enough to keep them destroyed.

This brings us to the central question: _is_ R1579 strong enough to do
what it says?  Well, does it conflict with R1435?  No.  R1435 simply
says that Indulgences are a Currency; R1579 says that they are in fact
a destroyed Currency. (**) This is similar to the repeal of a Rule;
longstanding Game Custom holds that a Rule or Proposal which repeals
another Rule is not for that sole reason in conflict with it. (***)
Thus 1579 did cause Indulgences to cease to exist, and they still
cease to exist to the present time.

NOTES:

(*) This possibility was raised during the discussion of the issues
surrounding a similar situation with regards to P-notes, so it is as
well to dispose of it here.

(**) My fellow learned Justice Michael objected that an earlier
version involves a "secret" insertion of "defunct" into the rule.
This wording is what I meant.

(***) My fellow learned Justice Michael also objected here, pointing
out that Rules and Rule changes occupy separate worlds.  But I feel
this misses the point of my analogy: a Rule Change (proposed or
unproposed) is effective only by virtue of Rules that allow it to take
effect.  Do those Rules (which affect the content of the Ruleset)
actually _conflict_ with the Rule being repealed?

This would be like having an implicit clause in each Rule that stated
"This rule may not be repealed"; game custom says it does not.
Similarly, Rule 1479 does not contain an implied "this currency may
not be destroyed" as part of its defining sentence.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Justice Michael's decision: OVERTURN/reverse

If Indulgences exist, then a Payment Order was executed by the
Chancellor when he attempted to transfer 9 Indulgences from the Bank
to Elde.

If Indulgences exist, then the Indulgence Currency's Recordkeepor is
authorised to record and execute Payment Orders (R1596).

Thus, if Indulgences exist, the correct judgement for this CFJ is
FALSE.

The argument that Indulgences do not exist is based on R1579, which
states that all Currencies have a Mintor and if a Currency should lose
its Mintor, then it is destroyed.  It is accepted that an entity known
as the Mint was the Mintor for Indulgences before the Pragmatic
Currencies reform occurred.

By virtue of R1586, we must also accept that the Mint no longer
exists, so it would appear that the antecedent of the conditional
sentence of the second paragraph in R1597 holds.  So, what might
prevent Indulgences from being destroyed, as required by R1579?

The answer is the precedence taking R1435.  This states that
"Indulgences are a Currency".  This statement must remain true,
whatever R1579 says to the contrary.  My Fellow Justice elJefe claims
that this is possible if one reads "Indulgences are a Currency" as
"Indulgences are a destroyed Currency".

This is a senseless contortion.  We do not need to put the rules
through such hoops.  We have rules taking precedence over each other
all the time.  When we read "Indulgences are a Currency", we know that
this is equivalent to stating that there exists a Currency whose name
is "Indulgences".  But now the opposing argument wants us to
simultaneously read this as admitting the precise opposite, that this
Currency doesn't exist at all.

I refuse to make the Rules play such tricks.  If a high precedence
rule says that Indulgences exist, then the lower precedence R1579 can
yammer on about Mintors and the lack thereof all it likes.

Indulgences exist.

Judge elJefe's reasoning on CFJ 929 applies here as well.

                               CFJ 940

Rule 1596 should be interpreted so that a message purporting to
be a Payment Order must, in order to satisfy that Rule's requirements
and qualify as a legal Payment Order, explicitly and unambiguously
state that the purported Payor is ordered to effect a payment as
a consequence of that message, e.g. by stating "Player X is commanded
to pay Y", the mere mention of an amount of a Currency, the name or
names of the Payor and Payee, or a reference to some Rule or some
situation that requires a Payment Order to be executed being
insufficient for a message not containing such a command or entreaty
to qualify as a Payment Order.

(Caller's) Arguments:

I believe this follows from Rule 1596's definition of a Payment Order
as "an order requiring an entity to" perform some action, and that no
message not framed as a command is a legal Payment Order.

Note that the claim that a particular message _is_ a Payment Order
is by that reasoning sufficient to satisfy Rule 1596's requirement.

I kindly request that the Judge of the CFJ enjoin the Rulekeepor to
annotate R1596 with the above statement and the list of relevant
Rules which follows : 1596.

following the distribution of each of these proposals.  It is like passing a
rule now which says, "September 1, 1997 through September 7, 1997 shall be
known as 'The Week of the Cumberbuns'".  This would retroactively give a
significance to those days, an effect which, I contend, is not prohibited by
R108.

'my argument above' is pointing to the following text (this line is
an insertion by the CotC):

                               CFJ 940

Rule 1596 should be interpreted so that a message purporting to
be a Payment Order must, in order to satisfy that Rule's requirements
and qualify as a legal Payment Order, explicitly and unambiguously
state that the purported Payor is ordered to effect a payment as
a consequence of that message, e.g. by stating "Player X is commanded
to pay Y", the mere mention of an amount of a Currency, the name or
names of the Payor and Payee, or a reference to some Rule or some
situation that requires a Payment Order to be executed being
insufficient for a message not containing such a command or entreaty
to qualify as a Payment Order.

As I explained in an earlier post, I think no such "instant" ever
--erm, what do instants do? exist? happen? well, never mind... --
anyway, there never was such an instant. That's why 1527 speaks of
infinitesimal time separations, not simply of small ones.

So the bank became mintor in time to save VTs, and so on and so on.

   19 Sep 1997 22:47:56 +0200 (MET DST)
======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

As Oerjan pointed out, there was an instant of time when Voting Tokens
also ceased to have a Mintor.

=====================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

In CFJ 933, Elde Judges the Statement to be TRUE.

The reasons for thinking so are briefly outlined as follows :

* before 3533 passed, the Mint was a Nomic Entity
* the Mint was defined by Rule 1470
* 3533 amended 1470 so that it no longer defined the Mint
* by Rule 1586, the Mint ceased to exist
* at that time, the Mintor of VTs was still the Mint (1696)
* by Rule 1579, all VTs were therefore destroyed at that instant
* (thereafter, 1696 was amended to make the Bank the VT Mintor)

Rule 1579 stated :

      If the designated Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist or ceases
      to possess Mint Authority, all units of that Currency are
      destroyed and the Currency ceases to exist.

It has been suggested that Rule 1579 was at that time in conflict 
with Rule 1471, which stated

      The Mintor of a Currency may, at any time, destroy those units
      of that Currency which it currently possesses in its Treasury,
      so long as this destruction is permitted by the Rules.  Units of
      Currency may not be otherwise destroyed except as specifically
      authorized by the Rules.

separate support for this position being sought from this provision 
in Rule 1467 :

      Neither Currencies nor units of Currency shall be created or
      destroyed except as specified by the Rules.

It must be noted that Rule 1579's provisions both authorize, and
specify the manner of, the destruction of units of any Currency
falling under its purview; therefore, no conflict exists, precisely
because of both 1467's and 1471's conflict-avoiding provisions.

I find Kolja's analysis of 1527/376 interesting, and at the very least
it deserves closer examination.  I therefore call for the appeal of
CFJ 933.

Decision of the Justiciar: SUSTAIN the judgement of FALSE

For trivial reasons.  The date in the statement is wrong for the caller's
argument to work, and there is no other reason for thinking the statement
true.

This is a factual error, not a spelling (etc.) error, nor the use of a
synonym or abbreviation, so I can't use Rule 754 to Judge the statement
that was probably intended.

The caller states:

>However, the Frankenstein Monster, at the time specified in the
>statement, contained the sentence
>
>      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Frankenstein Monster
>      is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing
>      the Frankenstein Monsters, which is permitted only when a
>      Frankenstein Monster or set of Frankenstein Monsters explicitly
>      or implicitly permits it.

This sentence was reported on 6 September 1997, _not_ at the time specified
in the Statement.

The only sentence addition reported on Mon, 11 August 1997, was:

      A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.


There is no reason to think that this addition made changes impossible.

"Rule 1513 should be interpreted such that, if a body of text has been

 Player to perform or not perform an action solely because the Rules

  Assigned to Steve, Mon, 8 Sep 1997 10:23:44 +0200 (MET DST)

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Rule 1513 ends with this text:

     Especially, no body of text is permitted to require Players to
     perform or not perform any actions unless said body of text has
     previously been made available to that Player.

This says "Text T can bind Player P only if P has read T"; it does not
say "Text T can bind Player P only if the Rules require that P can
receive a copy of T".

======================================================================

Decision and Reasoning Judge:

I Judge the Statement TRUE. Clearly any body of text that a Player has
read has been made available to that Player, under any definition of
what it means to be 'made available'. I don't necessarily accept the
suggestion made by the Caller that having been read by the Player is
a necessary condition for a text to have been made available to that
Player, but it certainly is sufficient.

======================================================================

                               CFJ 939

The provision in R1504 which states that:

      Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their
      legal report, and the Player making the report of the Infraction
      shall execute whatever Payment Order(s) are required to apply
      the penalty specified for that Infraction.

immediately upon the legal report of the *penalties*, not the legal
report of the Infractions.

I reproduce as my argument the one I gave for the same conclusion
in my Judgement of CFJ 937:

"It's worth commenting at this point on an ambiguity in R1504: it's
not clear whether the report of the Infraction and the report of the
gain in Blots have to be made in the same message, or whether the
report of gain in Blots can follow the report of the Infraction by up
to seven days. The first sentence [sic] of R1504 states that
"Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their legal
report". But the legal report of what: the penalties or the
infractions? If infractions is meant, R1504 is somewhat in tension
with itself, since it immediately goes on to imply (along with other
Rules, eg R1599) that the application of the penalty can be later
than the report of the Infraction. So I read R1504 as saying that
penalties for Infractions are applied at the time the penalty is
reported, which can be later than the time the Infraction is reported."

Requested Injunction:

I request that the Judge of the CFJ issue an Injunction requesting
the Rulekeepor to annotate R1504 with the statement and the list
of relevant Rules below, as e is permitted to do by R789.

Relevant Rules: 1504, 1599

====================================================================

Judge's Reasoning:

The first clause of the provision in question says

      Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their
      legal report

As a native English speaker, I have no hesitation in interpreting the
word "their" in this context to refer to "Penalties for Infractions".
The alternative interpretation, with the antecedent being "Infractions",
is a less natural (though still valid) construct.  Given such an
ambiguity, the more natural interpretation of the language must be used.

======================================================================
                               CFJ 940

Rule 1596 should be interpreted so that a message purporting to
be a Payment Order must, in order to satisfy that Rule's requirements
and qualify as a legal Payment Order, explicitly and unambiguously
state that the purported Payor is ordered to effect a payment as
a consequence of that message, e.g. by stating "Player X is commanded
to pay Y", the mere mention of an amount of a Currency, the name or
names of the Payor and Payee, or a reference to some Rule or some
situation that requires a Payment Order to be executed being
insufficient for a message not containing such a command or entreaty
to qualify as a Payment Order.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

I believe this follows from Rule 1596's definition of a Payment Order
as "an order requiring an entity to" perform some action, and that no
message not framed as a command is a legal Payment Order.

Note that the claim that a particular message _is_ a Payment Order
is by that reasoning sufficient to satisfy Rule 1596's requirement.

I kindly request that the Judge of the CFJ enjoin the Rulekeepor to
annotate R1596 with the above statement and the list of relevant
Rules which follows : 1596.

I judge this statement to be TRUE.

Injunction:
I hereby enjoin the Rulekeepor to annotate Rule 1596

  Judged FALSE by Vlad, 16 Sep 1997 00:16 -0500 (CDT)

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

The Frankenstein Generator, 1672, requires among other things that 

      vii) All proposed Amendments to the Frankenstein Rule must
           consist of a single sentence of additional text specifying
           the properties and effects of a Frankenstein Monster, to be
           inserted between the first and last paragraphs.

However, the Frankenstein Monster, at the time specified in the
statement, contained the sentence

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Frankenstein Monster 
      is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing 
      the Frankenstein Monsters, which is permitted only when a 
      Frankenstein Monster or set of Frankenstein Monsters explicitly
      or implicitly permits it.

It did not, however, contain any explicit or implicit permissions
permitting such changes.

The introduction of additional text "specifying the properties and
effects of a Frankenstein Monster" is equivalent to "changing the
Frankenstein Monsters". So the FM prohibits the only proposed
amendments to the FR allowed by the FG.
(Note that amendments that change nothing are excluded by point

       vi) No Amendment can be applied to the Frankenstein Rule that
           is substantially the same as any prior successfully applied
           Amendment to the Frankenstein Rule.

of 1672)

Admittedly, this argument has two ossible weaknesses: The equivalence
stated in the preceding paragraph may be challenged. But I consider
this equivalence to hold - let the judge decide for emself.

And the FM also contains the sentence

      A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.

But I would say that, while the FM is permitted to define such
mechanisms, it doesn't actually do it, so this sentence establishes no
explicit or implicit permission to change the FM, after all.

======================================================================

Decision & Arguments Judge:

I find the Statement FALSE.

The Caller's arguments included the following:

However, the Frankenstein Rule does contain the following clause:

A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.
---------------

"Any change to a Frankenstein Monster adopted in accordance with its
own mechanisms is legal." Now, in the absence of any clearly specified
mechanisms, is a given Amendment in accordance with them or not? Well,
your mileage may differ, but I consider this to be almost trivially true.
One cannot be in conflict with a non-existent law. Therefore, I declare
that (as of this time), the Frankenstein Monster gives implicit
permission to change itself.

Rule 789 should be interpreted such that a document purporting to be
a Call for Judgement alleging that a Rule should be interpreted in a
certain way, but which does not include a list of Relevant Rules
assembled by the Caller, which includes the Rule being interpreted, is
not in fact a CFJ, and that therefore neither the Clerk of the Courts

======================================================================

Relevant Rules: 789, 991

======================================================================
(Caller's) Arguments:
I don't really have particularly strong feelings about this one way
or the other, but it seems we need a decision, and this will set a
precedent we can use in future cases, should any such arise. I have
a mild tendency to think that the Statement is TRUE, for reasons which
I outline below.

There are reasonable arguments on both sides, which the Judge must
choose between. These turn on how the word 'must' in R789 should be
interpreted:

      A CFJ alleging a Rule should be interpreted in a certain way
      must be accompanied by a list of relevant Rules, assembled by
      the Caller, which includes the Rule being interpreted.

On the one hand, we could interpret this 'must' as imposing an obligation
on a Caller to include a list of Relevant Rules, an obligation which, if
the Caller fails to meet it, results in the Caller having violated R789.
On this reading, there is no reason to think that the legality of the CFJ
is brought into question by the Caller's having violated R789, and so the
Statement would be FALSE.

On the other hand, we could interpret this 'must' as imposing a condition
on what it takes to be a CFJ. On this reading, it is partially definitive
of being a CFJ (of the relevant kind) that it be accompanied by a list
of Relevant Rules. This would bring R789 into conflict with R991, which
offers an incompatible definition:

      Any document submitted to the Clerk of the Courts and which is
      clearly marked as a Call for Judgement is a Call for Judgement.

Since R789 wins this conflict by virtue of its lower Number, we arrive
at the conclusion that the Statement is TRUE.

Two possible interpretations, both plausible. Is there any reason to
favour one over the other? I think there is such a reason: the
precise wording of R789, which states that "A CFJ...must...", and not
"The Caller of a CFJ...must...". I think this gives us a reason to
regard to R789 more plausibly as imposing a condition on what it
takes to be a CFJ than as imposing a requirement on the Caller. It
may not be a terribly powerful reason for preferring the second
interpretation to the first, but in the absence of other compelling
reasons to make one judgement rather than the other, it may prove
decisive. At any rate, I offer it to the Judge for eir consideration.

Requested Injunction:

I request that the Judge issue an Injunction requiring the Rulekeepor
to annotate R789 with the Statement, as e is permitted to do by R789.
[Maybe at last I'll get my self-referential annotation of R789!]

======================================================================

Decision and Reasoning Judge:

My judgement on CFJ 942:

FALSE.

But for a reason no one seems to have noticed. I was, at first, quite 
inclined to agree with the Caller. In fact, I felt less equivocal about 
it than he did. It seemed to me that, in the absence of clear wording 
specifying that, without a list of Relevant Rules, the *Caller* had made 
an error or committed a crime, the correct interpretation would be that 
the CFJ was simply invalid without said list. The minimum requirement for 
that list would simply be a notation that the rule in question was itself 
relevant to the CFJ; after all, "a list of relevant rules" does not imply 
a *complete* list. And as anyone with LISP or set theory experience 
knows, a list with only one item is still a list.

But then I came to the part in the Caller's argument related to Rule 991. 
He noted that, under my interpretation of Rule 789, the two rules were in 
conflict. He then stated that, because of rule 789's lower number, it 
takes precedence. And that would be well and true except that Rule 991 
has a Power of 2, while Rule 789 has a Power of 1. Under Rule 1482 
(Power=3), Rule 991 thus takes precedence, and we are in a situation where

      Any document submitted to the Clerk of the Courts and which is
      clearly marked as a Call for Judgement is a Call for Judgement.
      (991/3)

Therefore the statement is FALSE.

Caller's Other Remarks:

Orders.]

======================================================================

Decision and Reasoning Judge

Judgement: FALSE

Reasons:

The major problem in this situation is that the concept of payment 
orders, blots, and penalties are incredibly poorly defined in relation to 
each other.

First of all, we have R1435, which tells us that a P.O. for 1 Indulgence 
with a payee as the Bank is called a Blot. It then tells us that when a 
Rule states that a Player is to gain some number of Blots, a P.O. shall 
be executed with that Player as the payor, the Bank as the payee, and for 
a # of indulgences equal to the # of Blots the Player is to receive.

Thus, we have now implicitly recognized the concept of "gaining" a 
payment order, since a PO for 1 Ind. to the Bank = a Blot. This is 
incredibly unclear wording. So once the Blotee has "gained" a payment 
order, someone else is required to "execute" a payment order. Are these 
P.O.'s the same? It's quite unclear. But, and the next paragraph of the 
rule gives some support for this, I'm going to assume that this is just 
poor phrasing.

So now someone is required to 'execute' the payment order. In this case, 
it was the CotC, under R408. A P.O. is "executed" by posting it to the 
Public Forum. So again, we have a point of confusion. Is a P.O. a 
message, or a string of text? Those things can be posted to the Public 
Forum. On the other hand, if that were the case, then any message in the 
correct form would be a P.O., and if it were specifically in the correct 
form under R1435, it would be a Blot. This is still a Blot, regardless of 
whether it has been 'executed.' So then, for example, I have a # of Blots 
= to the # of messages in that form that I have? Well, have where? In my 
mailbox? In some platonic mailbox? But then again, R1435 says a Player 
'may be said' to have a # of Blots = to something else entirely. Thus, a 
contradiction. Now, I'm not saying that this interpretation of a Blot as 
a message is correct, merely that is is highly unclear and ambiguous in 
the Rules.

R1596 never says that the *only* way a P.O. can be executed is for a 
player with the authority to post it to the Public Forum. Thus, except 
for one small point, I would be inclined to judge that R408, by assigning 
a penalty of 3 Blots to a crime, implicitly executes a P.O. for that 
amount. The problem, though (among many others I'm sure will be brought 
up over that point), is that a Blot "is to be executed by whomever is 
required to report the change in Blots." Thus, the CotC. So, as amazingly 
unclear as the situation is, it does appear that the CotC was required to 
'execute' the Blot/P.O.'s by 'post[ing] the Order to the Public Forum.'

So did he? *Yes.*

Why do I have a feeling this is going to be appealed? Anyway, here's why.

Here's what the CotC said: "Blob commits the Infraction of Failing to 
Judge, an action which bears the penalty of 3 Blots."

A Blot has been defined in the rules. Thus, this sentence is equivalent 
to:

Blob commits...an action which bears the penalty of 3 Payment Orders for 
1 Indulgence, the payees of which are the Bank. In my opinion, this 
"specifies exactly one source entity, exactly one destination entity, 
exactly one Currency, and a number of units of that Currency which is a 
positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ." 

The syntax and meaning of a 'penalty' makes it clear that Blob is the 
source entity, and the rest is clear.

The message concerning Elde was phrased identically. elJefe's was phrased 
differently:

"elJefe receives 3 Blots committing the Infraction of Failing to Judge."

So elJefe receives 3 P.O.'s? This syntax would seem to indicate that 
elJefe is the pay*ee* of this transaction! But the Bank is already 
defined as the payee, by the definition of a Blot. So this does *not* 
specify exactly one source entity and one destination entity. Thus, the 
CotC *did* fail to execute the required P.O. for the 3rd infraction. 
However, as the statement of the CFJ alleges that the CotC failed in all 
*3* cases, it must be judged FALSE.

A possible objection would be that R1435 specifies what it means to 'gain 
some # of Blots.' That is quite true -- it means that a P.O. shall be 
executed. But the P.O. was *not* executed, as R1435 does not mention 
anything about *messages* stating that players gain Blots, only about 
*Rules* which so state.

So my judgement is FALSE, CFJ 940 be damned. I have "considered game 
custom, commonsense, past Judgements, and the best interests of the game 
before applying other standards." I personally think CFJ 940 was judged 
incorrectly; however, that is irrelevant here. I'm under no obligation to 
abide by past incorrect judgements. :) What a welcome back to Agora!

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

As Oerjan pointed out, there was an instant of time when Voting Tokens
also ceased to have a Mintor.

=====================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

In CFJ 933, Elde Judges the Statement to be TRUE.

The reasons for thinking so are briefly outlined as follows :

* before 3533 passed, the Mint was a Nomic Entity
* the Mint was defined by Rule 1470
* 3533 amended 1470 so that it no longer defined the Mint
* by Rule 1586, the Mint ceased to exist
* at that time, the Mintor of VTs was still the Mint (1696)
* by Rule 1579, all VTs were therefore destroyed at that instant
* (thereafter, 1696 was amended to make the Bank the VT Mintor)

Rule 1579 stated :

      If the designated Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist or ceases
      to possess Mint Authority, all units of that Currency are
      destroyed and the Currency ceases to exist.

It has been suggested that Rule 1579 was at that time in conflict 
with Rule 1471, which stated

      The Mintor of a Currency may, at any time, destroy those units
      of that Currency which it currently possesses in its Treasury,
      so long as this destruction is permitted by the Rules.  Units of
      Currency may not be otherwise destroyed except as specifically
      authorized by the Rules.

separate support for this position being sought from this provision 
in Rule 1467 :

      Neither Currencies nor units of Currency shall be created or
      destroyed except as specified by the Rules.

It must be noted that Rule 1579's provisions both authorize, and
specify the manner of, the destruction of units of any Currency
falling under its purview; therefore, no conflict exists, precisely
because of both 1467's and 1471's conflict-avoiding provisions.

Appeals decisions

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Justice elJefe's decision: SUSTAIN

                              CFJ 930

"No Payment Orders have thus far been successfully executed, for the
 reason that none exist."

Judge Chuck relied on the reasoning of CFJ 929:

However, at the time of the CFJ, only one Transfer Order could have
been submitted, namely the Chancellor's transfer of 9 Indulgences
from the Bank to Elde. At that time the Mint (which was Mintor of
Indulgences) no longer had Mint Authority due to the effects of
Proposal 3533. Thus Indulgences ceased to exist as a Currency by
Rule 1579, and so the Chancellor's posting, not referring to any
Currency, was not a Transfer Order.

The only point in dispute is whether Indulgences continued to exist as
a currency after the adoption of Proposal 3533.  If they did then the
reasoning in the quoted paragraph of CFJ 929 is correct and the
judgement of TRUE stands.  If not then the judgement in both CFJs
should be FALSE, since the Misanthropists' currencies failed to
confuse itself with Payment Orders or Transfer Orders defined in the
Rules.

Quoting from Rule 1579: "If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist,
or ceases to have the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that
Currency are destroyed, and that Currency ceases to exist."  There is
unchallenged evidence that the old Mintor for Indulgences ceased to
exist, and that no new Mintor was designated.  Therefore unless this
conflicts with some higher-power Rule, it must be applied.

Rule 1435 begins "Indulgences are a Currency."  One possible
interpretation is that Indulgences were destroyed and ceased to exist
at a given instant; but then immediately after that R1435
re-established Indulgences as a Currency without a Mintor, which then
is immune to R1579 since it has no Mintor which can either cease
existing or lose Mint authority. (*)

This has several things wrong with it.  Rule 1435 is silent as to
whether Indulgences have a Mintor or not, so there is no conflict on
this point with R1579.  Thus any "re-establishment" of the currency
must follow the first sentence of R1579, which insists that each
Currency has a Mintor.

Further, the whole notion does not give sufficient respect to the
natural meaning of "cease to exist".  A rule mandating that something
ceases to exist does not mean for the thing to have its existence
interrupted temporarily and then re-appear.  If R1579 is strong enough
to destroy Indulgences (or P-notes) as a currency, then it is strong
enough to keep them destroyed.

This brings us to the central question: _is_ R1579 strong enough to do
what it says?  Well, does it conflict with R1435?  No.  R1435 simply
says that Indulgences are a Currency; R1579 says that they are in fact
a destroyed Currency. (**) This is similar to the repeal of a Rule;
longstanding Game Custom holds that a Rule or Proposal which repeals
another Rule is not for that sole reason in conflict with it. (***)
Thus 1579 did cause Indulgences to cease to exist, and they still
cease to exist to the present time.

NOTES:

(*) This possibility was raised during the discussion of the issues
surrounding a similar situation with regards to P-notes, so it is as
well to dispose of it here.

(**) My fellow learned Justice Michael objected that an earlier
version involves a "secret" insertion of "defunct" into the rule.
This wording is what I meant.

(***) My fellow learned Justice Michael also objected here, pointing
out that Rules and Rule changes occupy separate worlds.  But I feel
this misses the point of my analogy: a Rule Change (proposed or
unproposed) is effective only by virtue of Rules that allow it to take
effect.  Do those Rules (which affect the content of the Ruleset)
actually _conflict_ with the Rule being repealed?

This would be like having an implicit clause in each Rule that stated
"This rule may not be repealed"; game custom says it does not.
Similarly, Rule 1479 does not contain an implied "this currency may
not be destroyed" as part of its defining sentence.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Justice Michael's decision: OVERTURN/reverse

If Indulgences exist, then a Payment Order was executed by the
Chancellor when he attempted to transfer 9 Indulgences from the Bank
to Elde.

If Indulgences exist, then the Indulgence Currency's Recordkeepor is
authorised to record and execute Payment Orders (R1596).

Thus, if Indulgences exist, the correct judgement for this CFJ is
FALSE.

The argument that Indulgences do not exist is based on R1579, which
states that all Currencies have a Mintor and if a Currency should lose
its Mintor, then it is destroyed.  It is accepted that an entity known
as the Mint was the Mintor for Indulgences before the Pragmatic
Currencies reform occurred.

By virtue of R1586, we must also accept that the Mint no longer
exists, so it would appear that the antecedent of the conditional
sentence of the second paragraph in R1597 holds.  So, what might
prevent Indulgences from being destroyed, as required by R1579?

The answer is the precedence taking R1435.  This states that
"Indulgences are a Currency".  This statement must remain true,
whatever R1579 says to the contrary.  My Fellow Justice elJefe claims
that this is possible if one reads "Indulgences are a Currency" as
"Indulgences are a destroyed Currency".

This is a senseless contortion.  We do not need to put the rules
through such hoops.  We have rules taking precedence over each other
all the time.  When we read "Indulgences are a Currency", we know that
this is equivalent to stating that there exists a Currency whose name
is "Indulgences".  But now the opposing argument wants us to
simultaneously read this as admitting the precise opposite, that this
Currency doesn't exist at all.

I refuse to make the Rules play such tricks.  If a high precedence
rule says that Indulgences exist, then the lower precedence R1579 can
yammer on about Mintors and the lack thereof all it likes.

Indulgences exist.

Original Judgement: TRUE

Judge elJefe's reasoning on CFJ 929 applies here as well.

This has several things wrong with it.  Rule 1435 is silent as to
whether Indulgences have a Mintor or not, so there is no conflict on
this point with R1579.  Thus any "re-establishment" of the currency
must follow the first sentence of R1579, which insists that each
Currency has a Mintor.

Further, the whole notion does not give sufficient respect to the
natural meaning of "cease to exist".  A rule mandating that something
ceases to exist does not mean for the thing to have its existence
interrupted temporarily and then re-appear.  If R1579 is strong enough
to destroy Indulgences (or P-notes) as a currency, then it is strong
enough to keep them destroyed.

This brings us to the central question: _is_ R1579 strong enough to do
what it says?  Well, does it conflict with R1435?  No.  R1435 simply
says that Indulgences are a Currency; R1579 says that they are in fact
a destroyed Currency. (**) This is similar to the repeal of a Rule;
longstanding Game Custom holds that a Rule or Proposal which repeals
another Rule is not for that sole reason in conflict with it. (***)
Thus 1579 did cause Indulgences to cease to exist, and they still
cease to exist to the present time.

NOTES:

(*) This possibility was raised during the discussion of the issues
surrounding a similar situation with regards to P-notes, so it is as
well to dispose of it here.

(**) My fellow learned Justice Michael objected that an earlier
version involves a "secret" insertion of "defunct" into the rule.
This wording is what I meant.

(***) My fellow learned Justice Michael also objected here, pointing
out that Rules and Rule changes occupy separate worlds.  But I feel
this misses the point of my analogy: a Rule Change (proposed or
unproposed) is effective only by virtue of Rules that allow it to take
effect.  Do those Rules (which affect the content of the Ruleset)
actually _conflict_ with the Rule being repealed?

This would be like having an implicit clause in each Rule that stated
"This rule may not be repealed"; game custom says it does not.
Similarly, Rule 1479 does not contain an implied "this currency may
not be destroyed" as part of its defining sentence.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Justice Michael's decision: OVERTURN/reverse

If Indulgences exist, then a Payment Order was executed by the
Chancellor when he attempted to transfer 9 Indulgences from the Bank
to Elde.

If Indulgences exist, then the Indulgence Currency's Recordkeepor is
authorised to record and execute Payment Orders (R1596).

Thus, if Indulgences exist, the correct judgement for this CFJ is
FALSE.

The argument that Indulgences do not exist is based on R1579, which
states that all Currencies have a Mintor and if a Currency should lose
its Mintor, then it is destroyed.  It is accepted that an entity known
as the Mint was the Mintor for Indulgences before the Pragmatic
Currencies reform occurred.

By virtue of R1586, we must also accept that the Mint no longer
exists, so it would appear that the antecedent of the conditional
sentence of the second paragraph in R1597 holds.  So, what might
prevent Indulgences from being destroyed, as required by R1579?

The answer is the precedence taking R1435.  This states that
"Indulgences are a Currency".  This statement must remain true,
whatever R1579 says to the contrary.  My Fellow Justice elJefe claims
that this is possible if one reads "Indulgences are a Currency" as
"Indulgences are a destroyed Currency".

This is a senseless contortion.  We do not need to put the rules
through such hoops.  We have rules taking precedence over each other
all the time.  When we read "Indulgences are a Currency", we know that
this is equivalent to stating that there exists a Currency whose name
is "Indulgences".  But now the opposing argument wants us to
simultaneously read this as admitting the precise opposite, that this
Currency doesn't exist at all.

I refuse to make the Rules play such tricks.  If a high precedence
rule says that Indulgences exist, then the lower precedence R1579 can
yammer on about Mintors and the lack thereof all it likes.

Indulgences exist.

Judge elJefe's reasoning on CFJ 929 applies here as well.

                               CFJ 940

Rule 1596 should be interpreted so that a message purporting to
be a Payment Order must, in order to satisfy that Rule's requirements
and qualify as a legal Payment Order, explicitly and unambiguously
state that the purported Payor is ordered to effect a payment as
a consequence of that message, e.g. by stating "Player X is commanded
to pay Y", the mere mention of an amount of a Currency, the name or
names of the Payor and Payee, or a reference to some Rule or some
situation that requires a Payment Order to be executed being
insufficient for a message not containing such a command or entreaty
to qualify as a Payment Order.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments (slighted edited):

See my argument above concerning retroactive rule effects.  Another
example may help (which is why I worded the CFJ as I did).  The disinfection of
R693 can be seen as assigning an historical significance to the ten days
following the distribution of each of these proposals.  It is like passing a
rule now which says, "September 1, 1997 through September 7, 1997 shall be
known as 'The Week of the Cumberbuns'".  This would retroactively give a
significance to those days, an effect which, I contend, is not prohibited by
R108.

'my argument above' is pointing to the following text (this line is
an insertion by the CotC):

Steve wrote:

I appeal the judgement on CFJ 933.

>From the judgement:
>>
* at that time, the Mintor of VTs was still the Mint (1696)
* by Rule 1579, all VTs were therefore destroyed at that instant
                                                         ^^^^^^^
* (thereafter, 1696 was amended to make the Bank the VT Mintor)
<<

As I explained in an earlier post, I think no such "instant" ever
--erm, what do instants do? exist? happen? well, never mind... --
anyway, there never was such an instant. That's why 1527 speaks of
infinitesimal time separations, not simply of small ones.

So the bank became mintor in time to save VTs, and so on and so on.

I find Kolja's analysis of 1527/376 interesting, and at the very least
it deserves closer examination.  I therefore call for the appeal of
CFJ 933.

Decision of the Justiciar: SUSTAIN the judgement of FALSE

For trivial reasons.  The date in the statement is wrong for the caller's
argument to work, and there is no other reason for thinking the statement
true.

This is a factual error, not a spelling (etc.) error, nor the use of a
synonym or abbreviation, so I can't use Rule 754 to Judge the statement
that was probably intended.

The caller states:

>However, the Frankenstein Monster, at the time specified in the
>statement, contained the sentence
>
>      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Frankenstein Monster
>      is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing

>      or implicitly permits it.

This sentence was reported on 6 September 1997, _not_ at the time specified
in the Statement.

The only sentence addition reported on Mon, 11 August 1997, was:

      A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.


There is no reason to think that this addition made changes impossible.

Actually, Scott has already appealed it. And so, hereby, do I. Now

                               CFJ 938

"Rule 1513 should be interpreted such that, if a body of text has been
 read by a Player, then it shall not lack the power to require that
 Player to perform or not perform an action solely because the Rules
 fail to require that it be made available to that Player."

Judge:        Steve

Judgement:    TRUE

Eligible:     Andre, Antimatter, Blob, Calabresi, Chuck, Crito, Elde,

  Assigned to Steve, Mon, 8 Sep 1997 10:23:44 +0200 (MET DST)

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Rule 1513 ends with this text:

     Especially, no body of text is permitted to require Players to
     perform or not perform any actions unless said body of text has
     previously been made available to that Player.

This says "Text T can bind Player P only if P has read T"; it does not
say "Text T can bind Player P only if the Rules require that P can
receive a copy of T".

======================================================================

Decision and Reasoning Judge:

I Judge the Statement TRUE. Clearly any body of text that a Player has
read has been made available to that Player, under any definition of
what it means to be 'made available'. I don't necessarily accept the
suggestion made by the Caller that having been read by the Player is
a necessary condition for a text to have been made available to that
Player, but it certainly is sufficient.

Attention Rulekeepor! This CFJ contains an Injunction to annotate
a Rule!

======================================================================

                               CFJ 939

The provision in R1504 which states that:

      Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their
      legal report, and the Player making the report of the Infraction
      shall execute whatever Payment Order(s) are required to apply
      the penalty specified for that Infraction. 

should be interpreted such that penalties for Infractions are applied
immediately upon the legal report of the *penalties*, not the legal
report of the Infractions.

Judge:       Zefram

Judgement:   TRUE

Eligible:    Antimatter, Blob, Calabresi, ChrisM, Chuck, Elde, elJefe,

Not eligible:
Caller:	     Steve

On hold:     Swann

Injunction:

 The Rulekeepor is hereby commanded to annotate R1504 with the statement
 and the list of relevant Rules.

======================================================================

History:
  Called by Steve, 08 Sep 1997, 12:39 +1000 (EST)
  Crito asks to be made ineligible, 09 Sep 1997, 23:36 -0400

  Judged TRUE by Zefram, 16 Sep 1997 09:59:01 +0100

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

I reproduce as my argument the one I gave for the same conclusion
in my Judgement of CFJ 937:

"It's worth commenting at this point on an ambiguity in R1504: it's
not clear whether the report of the Infraction and the report of the
gain in Blots have to be made in the same message, or whether the
report of gain in Blots can follow the report of the Infraction by up
to seven days. The first sentence [sic] of R1504 states that
"Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their legal
report". But the legal report of what: the penalties or the
infractions? If infractions is meant, R1504 is somewhat in tension
with itself, since it immediately goes on to imply (along with other
Rules, eg R1599) that the application of the penalty can be later
than the report of the Infraction. So I read R1504 as saying that
penalties for Infractions are applied at the time the penalty is
reported, which can be later than the time the Infraction is reported."

Requested Injunction:

I request that the Judge of the CFJ issue an Injunction requesting
the Rulekeepor to annotate R1504 with the statement and the list
of relevant Rules below, as e is permitted to do by R789.

Relevant Rules: 1504, 1599

====================================================================

Judge's Reasoning:

The first clause of the provision in question says

      Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their
      legal report

As a native English speaker, I have no hesitation in interpreting the
word "their" in this context to refer to "Penalties for Infractions".
The alternative interpretation, with the antecedent being "Infractions",
is a less natural (though still valid) construct.  Given such an
ambiguity, the more natural interpretation of the language must be used.

Rule 1596 should be interpreted so that a message purporting to
be a Payment Order must, in order to satisfy that Rule's requirements
and qualify as a legal Payment Order, explicitly and unambiguously
state that the purported Payor is ordered to effect a payment as
a consequence of that message, e.g. by stating "Player X is commanded
to pay Y", the mere mention of an amount of a Currency, the name or
names of the Payor and Payee, or a reference to some Rule or some
situation that requires a Payment Order to be executed being
insufficient for a message not containing such a command or entreaty
to qualify as a Payment Order.

                               CFJ 941

All proposed Amendments to the Frankenstein Rule were made impossible
by the Frankenstein Generator when the change to the Frankenstein
Monster assigned to "Week 1", reported by the Mad Scientist on Mon,
11 August 1997, took effect.

  Judged FALSE by Vlad, 16 Sep 1997 00:16 -0500 (CDT)

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

The Frankenstein Generator, 1672, requires among other things that 

      vii) All proposed Amendments to the Frankenstein Rule must
           consist of a single sentence of additional text specifying
           the properties and effects of a Frankenstein Monster, to be
           inserted between the first and last paragraphs.

However, the Frankenstein Monster, at the time specified in the
statement, contained the sentence

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Frankenstein Monster 
      is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing 
      the Frankenstein Monsters, which is permitted only when a 
      Frankenstein Monster or set of Frankenstein Monsters explicitly
      or implicitly permits it.

It did not, however, contain any explicit or implicit permissions
permitting such changes.

The introduction of additional text "specifying the properties and
effects of a Frankenstein Monster" is equivalent to "changing the
Frankenstein Monsters". So the FM prohibits the only proposed
amendments to the FR allowed by the FG.
(Note that amendments that change nothing are excluded by point

       vi) No Amendment can be applied to the Frankenstein Rule that
           is substantially the same as any prior successfully applied
           Amendment to the Frankenstein Rule.

of 1672)

Admittedly, this argument has two ossible weaknesses: The equivalence
stated in the preceding paragraph may be challenged. But I consider
this equivalence to hold - let the judge decide for emself.

And the FM also contains the sentence

      A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.

But I would say that, while the FM is permitted to define such
mechanisms, it doesn't actually do it, so this sentence establishes no
explicit or implicit permission to change the FM, after all.

======================================================================

Decision & Arguments Judge:

I find the Statement FALSE.

The Caller's arguments included the following:

------------------------

However, the Frankenstein Rule does contain the following clause:

A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.
---------------

"Any change to a Frankenstein Monster adopted in accordance with its
own mechanisms is legal." Now, in the absence of any clearly specified
mechanisms, is a given Amendment in accordance with them or not? Well,
your mileage may differ, but I consider this to be almost trivially true.
One cannot be in conflict with a non-existent law. Therefore, I declare
that (as of this time), the Frankenstein Monster gives implicit
permission to change itself.

======================================================================

Decision and Reasoning Judge:

I judge this statement to be TRUE.

Injunction:
I hereby enjoin the Rulekeepor to annotate Rule 1596
with the statement and list of relevant Rules of this CFJ.

Reasons and Arguments:
I agree with the Caller's arguments.

======================================================================

Decision and Reasoning CotC:

In the issue of the Appelate decision of CFJ 940 I find the Judgement
incorrect. To me the fact that something is a Payment Order makes it
a priori what a Payment Order is defined to be, no matter in what
exact form it is brought out.

As can be seen from the discussions on agora-discussion it is not easy
to decide when a certain text is a Payment Order and when it isn't.
However, we are not to judge on that, as the premisse in the Statement
already is that the message is purporting to be a Payment Order.
Any phrase making it clear that a text is a Payment Order, makes it so,
provided that the provisions in the second sentence of Rule 1596 are
met. If further it is posted to the Public Forum, and by a Player with
the authority to execute it, it is executed.

I thus find the Judgement incorrect, and request REVERSAL of the
Judgement.

======================================================================

Decision and Reasoning Justiciar:

Decision of the Justiciar:   FALSE (reversing the original Judgement)

Rule 1596 begins:

      A Payment Order is an order requiring an entity (the payor) to
      submit a Transfer Order transferring units of a Currency from
      itself to some other entity (the payee).  A Payment Order
      specifies exactly one source entity, exactly one destination
      entity, exactly one Currency, and a number of units of that
      Currency which is a positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ.

The question is whether one could devise something that is unambiguously
(but not explicitly) an order, requiring a specified entity to submit a TO
for a specified amount of currency from itself to another specified entity,
_without_ explicitly and unambiguously stating that the purported Payor is
ordered to effect a payment as a consequence of that message.  I believe we
can.

Any ambiguity in the payee, payor, or amount of currency fails the Rule's
requirement that these are "specified".   "The Bank is ordered to pay
Player X" is not sufficient (though this sentence could possibly be part of
a complete and valid PO).  But if I say that "I order the Bank to pay 1 VT
to Player X," that is explicit and is a Payment Order, assuming I had
authority to issue it.

Suppose we do not _explicitly_ state that the Bank is commanded to effect a
payment as a consequence.  If the Speaker says "Player X is awarded one VT
from the Bank, for meritorious conduct," then this alone is not
unambiguously an order and on its own would not be a PO.  (As others have
pointed out, it could just be an observation.)

However, this sentence together with other text could be an order.  Suppose
the Speaker posts a message consisting of

        --------------------------------------------
                      OFFICIAL NOTICE
                    Speaker's Patronage

        Player X is awarded one VT from the Bank,
        for meritorious conduct.
        --------------------------------------------

Surely in the old days the person responsible for recording VTs would have
treated this entire message as an order and felt required to act upon it.
It unambiguously (but not explicitly) requires the Bank to pay a specified
amount of currency to a specified player, and nowadays that will mean
issuing a Transfer Order. Thus it satisfies all the requirements for a PO.

This is sufficient to determine the decision, so I will not lengthen this
decision by considering Blots.  But I will say that these are a thorny
issue involving interactions of rules, and the question of whether an order
can "specify" things like payees, payors, and amounts, by having the
players delve into various Rules to determine them.  It is not clear.

Regards,
-- elJefe, Justiciar

======================================================================

Decision and Reasoning Speaker:

It is the opinion of the Speaker that the Judgement in CFJ 940 should
be OVERTURNED, and that the original Judgement be REVERSED.

I concur with my fellow Justices on this matter.  While there is
indeed a substantial issue as to whether certain phrases are or are
not Payment Orders, the requirements expressed in the Statement of
this CFJ go far beyond the statutory requirements of Rule 1596.  I see
no reason to believe that Rule 1596 requires that any of the elements
of a Payment Order (Payee, Payor, Currency, or amount) be _explicitly_
specified in a message which purports to convey a Payment Order.  All
that need be required is that the message be clearly identifiable as
conveying a Payment Order, and that all of the elements of the Payment
Order thus conveyed be determinable with reasonable certainty, either
from being explicitly stated within that message, or reasonably
deducible from the context in which that message was sent.  I leave
the question as to what constitutes "reasonably deducible" and
"reasonable certainty" to future Judges; it is not an issue in this
matter.

I also take issue with the claim that a message might purport to be a
Payment Order.  A message may purport to convey a Payment Order, but
all Rule 1596 states is that a Payment Order is an order.  There is no
reason to believe that an order is a message; rather, I contend that
messages are a means (and, in this case, the sole legally effective
mean) to convey orders to their obligees.  The confusion is
understandable, but I do not wish this confusion of terms to become
entrenched, and so I take this opportunity to expound upon it.

Respectfully submitted,

General Chaos
Speaker of Agora Nomic

                               CFJ 941

All proposed Amendments to the Frankenstein Rule were made impossible
by the Frankenstein Generator when the change to the Frankenstein
Monster assigned to "Week 1", reported by the Mad Scientist on Mon,
11 August 1997, took effect.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

The Frankenstein Generator, 1672, requires among other things that 

      vii) All proposed Amendments to the Frankenstein Rule must
           consist of a single sentence of additional text specifying
           the properties and effects of a Frankenstein Monster, to be
           inserted between the first and last paragraphs.

However, the Frankenstein Monster, at the time specified in the
statement, contained the sentence

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Frankenstein Monster 
      is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing 
      the Frankenstein Monsters, which is permitted only when a 
      Frankenstein Monster or set of Frankenstein Monsters explicitly
      or implicitly permits it.

It did not, however, contain any explicit or implicit permissions
permitting such changes.

The introduction of additional text "specifying the properties and
effects of a Frankenstein Monster" is equivalent to "changing the
Frankenstein Monsters". So the FM prohibits the only proposed
amendments to the FR allowed by the FG.
(Note that amendments that change nothing are excluded by point

       vi) No Amendment can be applied to the Frankenstein Rule that
           is substantially the same as any prior successfully applied
           Amendment to the Frankenstein Rule.

of 1672)

Admittedly, this argument has two ossible weaknesses: The equivalence
stated in the preceding paragraph may be challenged. But I consider
this equivalence to hold - let the judge decide for emself.

And the FM also contains the sentence

      A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.

But I would say that, while the FM is permitted to define such
mechanisms, it doesn't actually do it, so this sentence establishes no
explicit or implicit permission to change the FM, after all.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

I find the Statement FALSE.

The Caller's arguments included the following:

It did not, however, contain any explicit or implicit permissions
permitting such changes.

------------------------

However, the Frankenstein Rule does contain the following clause:

A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.
---------------

"Any change to a Frankenstein Monster adopted in accordance with its
own mechanisms is legal." Now, in the absence of any clearly specified
mechanisms, is a given Amendment in accordance with them or not? Well,
your mileage may differ, but I consider this to be almost trivially true.
One cannot be in conflict with a non-existent law. Therefore, I declare
that (as of this time), the Frankenstein Monster gives implicit
permission to change itself.

Vlad

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Justiciar:

Decision of the Justiciar: SUSTAIN the judgement of FALSE

For trivial reasons.  The date in the statement is wrong for the caller's
argument to work, and there is no other reason for thinking the statement
true.

This is a factual error, not a spelling (etc.) error, nor the use of a
synonym or abbreviation, so I can't use Rule 754 to Judge the statement
that was probably intended.

The caller states:

>However, the Frankenstein Monster, at the time specified in the
>statement, contained the sentence

>      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Frankenstein Monster

>      or implicitly permits it.

This sentence was reported on 6 September 1997, _not_ at the time specified
in the Statement.

The only sentence addition reported on Mon, 11 August 1997, was:

      A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.


There is no reason to think that this addition made changes impossible.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Speaker:

It is the opinion of the Speaker that the Judgement in CFJ 941 should
be OVERTURNED, that the original Judgement be VACATED, and the
original CFJ DISMISSED.

The Statement of CFJ 941 refers to the "change to the Frankenstein
Monster assigned to 'Week 1', reported by the Mad Scientist on Mon, 11
August 1997".  This entity does not exist; nothing in the Report of
the Mad Scientist posted on 11 August 1997 assigned anything to 'Week
1', as my fellow Justice elJefe has noted. 

There are two schools of reasoning regarding the truth values of
statements which contain definite descriptions of entities which do
not exist; one school holds that all such statements are categorically
FALSE, while the other holds that such statements are not well-formed
and thus have no truth value.  I am of the latter school.  I find that
the Statement of CFJ 941 "can not logically admit to either being TRUE
or FALSE", and therefore this CFJ should properly have been dismissed
under Rule 1565(ii).

Respectfully submitted,

General Chaos
Speaker, Agora Nomic

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning CotC:

As my fellow Justice elJefe already noted, the change claimed to make
future Amendments impossible, was not reported on 11 August, although
some other, much less dangerous change was. However, there is something
more to discuss. As can be seen from the actual 11 August report,
there is no ''change to the Frankenstein Monster assigned to "Week 1", 
reported by the Mad Scientist on Mon, 11 August 1997,'' and thus also
no time when it took effect.

To General Chaos this has let to a dismissal, as the truth of a statement
about a non-existing object cannot be decided, and even has no logical
meaning. However, I would not go that far. In my opinion some statements
can and other can't be decided. "The pink unicorn has 678 legs" is
undecidable, but "The pink unicorn has made me pregnant" is false. Maybe
it has to do with its effects on reality. But what about "All proposed 
Amendments to the Frankenstein Rule were made impossible by the 
Frankenstein Generator when the pink unicorn was born"? It's a close call,
but to me it is false. And so I judge.

Normally it's my opinion that in case the decisive points are points that
neither the Judge nor the Appellants (how is that spelled?) have mentioned,
the Court of Appeals should ask for rejudgement, but in this case it is
clear that either FALSE or Dismissal is right, and their difference is of
no importance.

Thus, I call for SUSTAINing the Judgement of FALSE.

>
>"All Voting Tokens were destroyed as a result of the Pragmatic
> Currencies Proposal taking effect."
>
>======================================================================
Decision of the Justiciar: TRUE (sustaining the original Judgement)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Judge Elde/Morendil argues that during implementation of the Proposal, a
rule change caused the Mint to cease being a mintor when it was the mintor
of VTs, before another rule change made the Bank the mintor of VTs.

There are several different interpretations on how the provisions of a
Proposal are implemented, which may affect the argument.  (For example, if
the provisions are implemented simultaneously, then the Mint did not cease
to be a mintor _before_ the Bank was mintor.)

But no matter which interpretation is chosen, it remains that the Mint
_did_ cease to have Mint Authority.  CFJ 828 (Destruction of Group Coins)
teaches that this is enough to satisfy the precise wording of Rule 1579,
even if it could be shown that VTs had a mintor at every legally
significant time.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Original Judge's argument

Proposal 3533, the Pragmatic Currencies proposal, was implemented under
authority of Rule 594.  Judge Elde argues that at the time Rule 1470 was
amended (depriving the Mint of Mint Authority),  Rule 1696 still named the
Mint as the Mintor for VTs. The conclusion is that Rule 1579 acted at that
moment to destroy all Voting Tokens.


2. How the provisions of a Proposal are implemented

There are several interpretations of the Rules on how the provisions of a
Proposal are implemented.

The Sequential View:   Each provision is implemented in order, if allowed
                       by the Rules then in effect, and the Game State is
                       adjusted to include consequent effects of this before
                       turning to the next provision.

The Atomic View:       Each provision is implemented in order, if allowed
                       by the Rules in effect at the adoption of the Proposal,
                       but no consequent effects cause an adjustment to the
                       Game State until all provisions have been dealt with.

The Simultaneous View: All the provisions are considered to be implemented
                       simultaneously,  if allowed by the Rules in effect
                       at the adoption of the Proposal, except where
                       dependencies among the provisions require that some
                       are implemented in sequence with other ones.

All three of these are consistent with the Rules, and the choice between
them must therefore rest on "game custom, commonsense, past Judgements, and
the best interests of the game."

The present decision does not require us to choose among these, and thus we
refrain from expressing an opinion as to which is preferred.


3.  Destruction of Game Coins, CFJ 828

It's fair to compare the present situation to the one arising in CFJ 828.
In that case, Proposal 1760 had revamped the Group rules but had forgotten
to provide that each Group was the mintor of its own Group Coins, or in
fact that Groups were permitted to be the mintors of anything.  However, a
Rule (1467) provided that "The Mintor of a Currency is the Mint if it is
not otherwise defined."

But the clear meaning of Rule 1471, worded very much like the two most
recent forms of Rule 1579, is that when one entity ceases to have authority
to mint a currency and another begins to have that authority in its stead,
then that currency is indeed destroyed.

The judgement in CFJ 828 states:
>Rule 1474/0 clearly said that the Mintor for a Group's Coins was the
>Group. That language was amended away by Proposal 1760, and the Group
>issuing the Coins then ceased to have authority to be a Mintor, that
>authority now going to the Mint.
>
>Rule 1471/0 states that
>
>   If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist, or ceases to have
>                                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
>   the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that Currency
>   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
>   are immediately destroyed, and Currency ceases to exist.

[...]

>Even though a conclusion is inconvenient, the temptation of avoiding it
>by misinterpreting the Rules, or language, must be resisted.  The change

Rule 1579/1 partly stated:
      If the designated Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist or ceases
      to possess Mint Authority, all units of that Currency are
      destroyed and the Currency ceases to exist.

Rule 1579/2 partly stated:
      If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist, or ceases to have
      the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that Currency
      are destroyed, and that Currency ceases to exist.


The inclusion of "designated" in Rule 1579/1 is not enough to change the
result.  The meaning of "mintor" and "designated mintor" have at all times
been the same, namely the mintor designated by the Rules.

Thus I rule that the statement was correctly judged TRUE.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge (Michael):

I wish to dismiss all of the CFJs to which I have been assigned on the
grounds that they are not relevant to the game, a justification which
is admissible by virtue of R1565, clause iii.  

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge (Zefram):

I hereby Judge as follows:

977: TRUE
998: FALSE
1001: TRUE

Oh yeah? I hereby dismiss the following CFJs assigned to me under 
*R1563*.  :)

947, 966, 969, 976, 980, 1002, 1003, 1029, and 1034.




I do not believe that they are  "able to be
      determined by the means of logical reasoning, with the
      presumption of perfect knowledge, to be either TRUE or FALSE."
      
In addition, I consider them "vacuous" under this same rule.

Note that only one of these conditions needs to be met to dismiss 
them...I include both in the hopes of avoiding argumentation. Not that I 
really have any hope of that. :)

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge (elJefe):

I hereby DISMISS CFJs 1018, 1028, and 1030 under Rule 1565(iii), as their
statements do not relate to matters relevant to the Rules.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge (Andre):

I hereby dismiss CFJs 965, 992, 1006 and 1040 because their Statement does
not relate to a matter relevant to the Rules, and CFJs 974, 1004 and 1031
because no determination can be made of the truth or falsity of their
Statement.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge (Crito):

I notice that the R1563 requires me to dismiss all of these CFJs since the
statement is vacuous, in that it can be judged either true or false without any
logical inconsistency.  Therefore,

I hereby dismiss CFJ 954.
I hereby dismiss CFJ 983.
I hereby dismiss CFJ 996.
I hereby dismiss CFJ 1016.
I hereby dismiss CFJ 1039.

Decision & Reasoning Judge (Oerjan):

BTW, it may not be a good idea for all of us to send our Judgements to the
PF. Please note that it is completely legal to send it to CotC Andre
instead. I am sending this to the PF because I got the odd one out and
I wish to solicit comments.

I hereby Dismiss both of these CFJs under 1565 (iii): these Statements
are (obviously) not relevant to the Rules.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge (Vir):

I hereby dismiss CFJs 950, 979, 988, 1005, 1020, and 1041 under Rule 1563
because they cannot be determined logically to be either TRUE or FALSE and
because they are vacuous.

I dismiss CFJ 952 on the grounds that it cannot be determined by the
means of logical reasoning, with the presumption of perfect knowledge,
to be either TRUE or FALSE.

I dismiss CFJ 985 on the grounds that it is vacuous.

I dismiss CFJ 1010 on the grounds that its statement does not
relate to a matter relevant to the Rules.

>	    1014: Chuck

I dismiss CFJ 1014 on the grounds that after a reasonable effort
by the Judge to obtain all relevant inforamtion, no determination
can be made of the truth or falsity of its statement.

>	    1044: Chuck

I dismiss CFJ 1044 on the grounds that Rules 1563 and 1565 require me
to do so.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge (Murphy):

I do not dismiss CFJ 962 per 1565/iii ("Its Statement does not relate to a
matter relevant to the Rules").  The Statement of CFJ 962 obviously relates
to CFJ 962 itself, which is a matter relevant to the Rules.  (If this
argument is to be believed, then no CFJ may be dismissed per 1565/iii,
which should therefore be reworded.)

However, I do dismiss CFJ 962 on the following grounds:

* 1565/vi:   After a reasonable effort by the Judge to obtain all relevant
               information, no determination can be made of the truth or
               falsity of its Statement.
* 1563:      Its Statement is unable to be determined by the means of
               logical reasoning, with the presumption of perfect knowledge,
               to be either TRUE or FALSE.

I interpret these clauses as they were surely intended, namely "no
determination can be made as to whether or not its Statement is true"
and "It is impossible to determine ... whether or not its Statement is
true", as opposed to the alternate convoluted interpretations that have
recently been offered.

I dismiss CFJ  978, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ  982, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ  984, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ  989, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ  990, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ  994, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1019, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1021, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1022, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1026, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1027, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1032, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1036, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1043, on the same grounds.

I'll take my 45 Mil in 5-Mark notes, please.  :)

I hereby dismiss these CFJs, since they do not admit to either truth
or falsity.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge (General Chaos):

I hereby DISMISS CFJs 946, 960, 981, 995, 1000, and 1012, each for the
reason that its Statement "does not relate to a matter relevant to the
Rules" (Rule 1565(iii)) and for the reason that its Statement is
vacuous (Rule 1563).

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge (Morendil):

I hereby Dismiss any CFJs currently assigned to me with numbers in

Assuming the above was successfully executed, I too dismiss
any CFJs currently assigned to me in the ranges 945-970 or 972-1044, on
the grounds of their being inadmissable under Rules 1563 or 1565.

======================================================================

Evidence (added by Judge Chuck): Rule 1563 and 1565

Rule 1563/1 (Power=1)
Statement of a CFJ

      In order to be Judged, a Call for Judgement must contain a
      single clearly-labeled Statement which must be able to be
      determined by the means of logical reasoning, with the
      presumption of perfect knowledge, to be either TRUE or FALSE.
      Statements which are inherently contradictory or which are
      vacuous are not acceptable, and a CFJ containing such a
      Statement shall not be Judged.

      If a Call for Judgement does not contain a Statement of the sort
      required by this Rule, its Judge is required to dismiss the CFJ,
      as described elsewhere.

      It is permitted for a Call for Judgement to contain Arguments,
      Evidence, or other material placed there at the Caller's
      discretion.  However, the Judge is not required to take notice
      of any part of the CFJ other than the Statement in formulating
      eir Judgement.

History:
Created by Proposal 2457, Feb. 16 1996
Null-Amended(1) by Proposal 3454 (Harlequin), Apr. 7 1997, cosmetic
  (unattributed)

Rule 1565/3 (Power=1)
Dismissal of a CFJ

      A Judge must dismiss a CFJ if one of the following is true of
      it:

        i) It contains no clearly-identifiable Statement.
       ii) Its Statement can not logically admit to either being TRUE
           or FALSE.
      iii) Its Statement does not relate to a matter relevant to the
           Rules.
       iv) Its Statement fails to comply with the Rules.
        v) It lacks standing, as defined elsewhere.
       vi) After a reasonable effort by the Judge to obtain all
           relevant information, no determination can be made of the
           truth or falsity of its Statement.

      The Judge does this by notifying the CotC of the CFJ's
      dismissal, and the reasons e is doing so.  Dismissals are only
      legal when made for the reasons listed in this Rule, and when
      only when issued by the Judge within the permitted deliberation
      period.  Dismissal occurs when the CotC is notified of a legal
      dismissal.

      As soon as possible after being notified of a legal dismissal,
      the CotC must post to the Public Forum a notice of the dismissal
      and the Judge's reasons for doing so.

      If the dismissal, upon appeal, is subsequently set aside, then
      that CFJ is no longer dismissed. It shall be considered again
      and can not again be legally dismissed for the same reasons.

      A Judge who dismisses a CFJ shall receive a Judicial Salary of 3
      Mil.

CFJ 909, Mar. 17 1997: The phrase 'considered again' in Rule 1565
should be interpreted such that when a dismissal of a CFJ has been set
aside, the Clerk of the Courts should assign the CFJ to a new Judge
selected from among those eligible, who then has one week to deliver a
Judgement.

If you accept that, it will make life much easier, so I hereby request
being made ineligible this way. We don't need "further notice",

Oh, hell, why doesn't somebody do the following.

I hereby make a Call For Judgment on the following statement, barring
Oerjan and Morendil:

Statement: The Rules lack agency.

Argument: The Rules derive their authority from the General Will of all
the Players. Any appearance of agency then seem to have is derived from
that authority.

I invite other Players to contribute their arguments.

I hereby make and admit the following COE:

The posting of CFJ 1045 is in error, in that the CFJ was not called by
Kolja A., but by Vir.

No new choice of Judge is necessary, as Kolja A. simply takes Virs
place on the eligibility list.

The corrected version of the important part of the CFJ is as follows:

  CFJs 945-970 and 972-1044 do not contain a statement of the sort
      required by rule 1563, and as such, must be dismissed.

Scott, read the Judgement again.  I think you'll find there are
more than 4 Injunctions there.

I hereby call for the appeal of all Injunctions issued with
the Judgement of CFJ 1045.

  Judged TRUE by Morendil, 30 Sep 1997 17:51:10 +0100

============================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

In CFJ 1045, I find the Statement to be TRUE.

I am in essential agreement with the Caller that Rule 1563 provides
more than adequate justification for Dismissing the named CFJs, in
spite of some arduous wording which made it briefly tempting - given
the rewards of returning a Judgement on, rather than Dismiss, these
CFJs - to wriggle my way out of it.


But wait, there is more.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the sum total of
Payment Orders in Indulgences naming that Player as Payor that they
have thus far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the sum total of Payment
Orders in Voting Tokens naming that Player as Payor that they have
thus far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Proposal Notes equal to the sum total of
Payment Orders in Indulgences naming that Player as Payor that they
have thus far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to the Registrar, requiring em to issue, for each Player, a
Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, that Player as Payee, for an
amount of 5 VTs. (So we can Vote on Proposals, y'know...)

The above facially satisfy provisions i) through iv) of Rule 663
pertaining to Injunctions; it is my belief that they also satisfy v), 
though that requires us to examine any Rule relevant thereto. I
find one, Rule 1736 itself, which states

      The Rules may require, in certain cases, that a Judge issue an
      Injunction ordering the execution of a Payment Order.  If the
      Payment Order required by such an Injunction is executed, and
      the Injunction itself later set aside, the Player who executed
      the required Payment Order shall, as soon as possible after the
      Injunction was set aside, vacate that Payment Order.

This merely states that Rules are permitted to require Judges to
issue Injuctions under certain circumstances; it is as far as I can
see no bar to a Judge taking it upon emself to issue any legal
Injuction. No prohibition of any kind in fact obtains with respect
to issuing Injuctions defined in 1736/1737; the procedure for issuing
an Injunction is well delineated, and followed to a T in this
Judgement; issuing an Injunctions in the present circumstances is 
therefore possible and unprohibited, which I submit is all that 'in a 
manner consistent with the Rules' requires.

Lastly, a note as to intent - obviously, this loophole can be used
for massive personal gain (well, once the status of Currencies has
been determined), and just as obviously it will be extremely tempting
for other Players assigned to Judge CFJs to take advantage of it for
the same reasons. It could also be used to summarily deregister 
anyone from the Game by assigning them 31 Blots.

There is no limit to how far this could be abused; if everyone jumps
on that bandwagon, all we will do is spoil the game absolutely.
Better we should fix that loophole, and quick, and refrain from
doing anything else about it for the sake of preserving the game's
fun.

I think the above is even-handed enough that Players (especially
Justices or Judges with CFJs currently assigned to em) will see their
own interest in letting it stand at that.

(And remember, you ain't seen nothing yet.)

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:


Relevant Rules: 1563

Rule 1563/1 (Power=1)
Statement of a CFJ

      In order to be Judged, a Call for Judgement must contain a
      single clearly-labeled Statement which must be able to be
      determined by the means of logical reasoning, with the
      presumption of perfect knowledge, to be either TRUE or FALSE.
      Statements which are inherently contradictory or which are
      vacuous are not acceptable, and a CFJ containing such a
      Statement shall not be Judged.

      If a Call for Judgement does not contain a Statement of the sort
      required by this Rule, its Judge is required to dismiss the CFJ,
      as described elsewhere.

      It is permitted for a Call for Judgement to contain Arguments,
      Evidence, or other material placed there at the Caller's
      discretion.  However, the Judge is not required to take notice
      of any part of the CFJ other than the Statement in formulating
      eir Judgement.

Before I begin arguing, I'd like to say that when I refer to "the
statement", I refer to the statement "This statement is TRUE.", and when I
refer to "the CFJ", I'm referring to the CFJ I am submitting.  I'm keeping
this consistancy so that it's clear what I am talking about.

The statement "This statement is TRUE." cannot be determined to be either
TRUE or FALSE by means of logical reasoning.

If the statement is TRUE, then it follows that the statement is TRUE, and
there's no contradiction.  If the statement is FALSE, then it follows that
the statement is FALSE, and there's no contradiction.  Therefore, the
statement is both TRUE and FALSE and is not either TRUE or FALSE.

The statement is also vacuous, and is therefore not acceptable.

vacuous (v*k*y-es) adjective
1.	Devoid of matter; empty.
2.	a. Lacking intelligence; stupid. b. Devoid of substance or meaning;
inane: a vacuous comment. c. Devoid of expression; vacant: "The narrow,
swinelike eyes were open, no more vacuous in death than they had been in
life" (Nicholas Proffitt).
3.	Lacking serious purpose or occupation; idle. See synonyms at EMPTY.
[From Latin vacuus, empty. See VACUUM.]
- vac*uously adverb
- vac*uousness noun

The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Third Edition
copyright * 1992 by Houghton Mifflin Company. Electronic version licensed
from InfoSoft International, Inc. All rights reserved.

definitions 2b, 2c, and 3 all support the statement being vacuous.
definition 1 would imply an empty statement, like a null set, but then
there would be no statement to be vacuous, so definition 1 does not apply.
definition 2a is a matter of taste, so it does not apply.

The statement has not substance or meaning in game terms or in terms of
anything other than the statement.

I'd like to also note that this CFJ must be judged TRUE if it is determined
by the judge that the statement cannot be judged TRUE or FALSE by logical
reasoning or the statement is vacuous.  Either one of those being TRUE (or
both being true) makes this CFJ true.

I am reasonably convinced that CFJ 1045 is not a "certain case" in the
sense used by Rule 1736, and that Morendil's Injunctions are therefor
illegally made.  I therefore call for the Appeal of all four, and note
that my call is adequate in itself to force an Appeal of the first
three of them by virtue of being named in them.

Well, we might as well get things underway. I call for the Appeal
of all the Injunctions made by Morendil in his Judgement of CFJ 1045.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

As Oerjan pointed out, there was an instant of time when Voting Tokens
also ceased to have a Mintor.
Decision of the Justiciar: TRUE (sustaining the original Judgement)

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Justiciar:

Judge Elde/Morendil argues that during implementation of the Proposal, a
rule change caused the Mint to cease being a mintor when it was the mintor
of VTs, before another rule change made the Bank the mintor of VTs.

There are several different interpretations on how the provisions of a
Proposal are implemented, which may affect the argument.  (For example, if
the provisions are implemented simultaneously, then the Mint did not cease
to be a mintor _before_ the Bank was mintor.)

But no matter which interpretation is chosen, it remains that the Mint
_did_ cease to have Mint Authority.  CFJ 828 (Destruction of Group Coins)
teaches that this is enough to satisfy the precise wording of Rule 1579,
even if it could be shown that VTs had a mintor at every legally
significant time.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Original Judge's argument

Proposal 3533, the Pragmatic Currencies proposal, was implemented under
authority of Rule 594.  Judge Elde argues that at the time Rule 1470 was
amended (depriving the Mint of Mint Authority),  Rule 1696 still named the
Mint as the Mintor for VTs. The conclusion is that Rule 1579 acted at that
moment to destroy all Voting Tokens.


2. How the provisions of a Proposal are implemented

There are several interpretations of the Rules on how the provisions of a
Proposal are implemented.

The Sequential View:   Each provision is implemented in order, if allowed
                       by the Rules then in effect, and the Game State is
                       adjusted to include consequent effects of this before
                       turning to the next provision.

The Atomic View:       Each provision is implemented in order, if allowed
                       by the Rules in effect at the adoption of the Proposal,
                       but no consequent effects cause an adjustment to the
                       Game State until all provisions have been dealt with.

The Simultaneous View: All the provisions are considered to be implemented
                       simultaneously,  if allowed by the Rules in effect
                       at the adoption of the Proposal, except where
                       dependencies among the provisions require that some
                       are implemented in sequence with other ones.

All three of these are consistent with the Rules, and the choice between
them must therefore rest on "game custom, commonsense, past Judgements, and
the best interests of the game."

The present decision does not require us to choose among these, and thus we
refrain from expressing an opinion as to which is preferred.


3.  Destruction of Game Coins, CFJ 828

It's fair to compare the present situation to the one arising in CFJ 828.
In that case, Proposal 1760 had revamped the Group rules but had forgotten
to provide that each Group was the mintor of its own Group Coins, or in
fact that Groups were permitted to be the mintors of anything.  However, a
Rule (1467) provided that "The Mintor of a Currency is the Mint if it is
not otherwise defined."

But the clear meaning of Rule 1471, worded very much like the two most
recent forms of Rule 1579, is that when one entity ceases to have authority
to mint a currency and another begins to have that authority in its stead,
then that currency is indeed destroyed.

The judgement in CFJ 828 states:
>Rule 1474/0 clearly said that the Mintor for a Group's Coins was the
>Group. That language was amended away by Proposal 1760, and the Group
>issuing the Coins then ceased to have authority to be a Mintor, that
>authority now going to the Mint.
>
>Rule 1471/0 states that
>
>   If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist, or ceases to have
>                                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
>   the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that Currency
>   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
>   are immediately destroyed, and Currency ceases to exist.
>
>
>Therefore the old Coins ceased to exist upon adoption of Proposal 1760.
[...]
>
>Even though a conclusion is inconvenient, the temptation of avoiding it
>by misinterpreting the Rules, or language, must be resisted.  The change
>of Mintor means that one entity ceased to have the authority and another
>one began having it.


Rule 1579/1 partly stated:
      If the designated Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist or ceases
      to possess Mint Authority, all units of that Currency are
      destroyed and the Currency ceases to exist.

Rule 1579/2 partly stated:
      If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist, or ceases to have
      the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that Currency
      are destroyed, and that Currency ceases to exist.


The inclusion of "designated" in Rule 1579/1 is not enough to change the
result.  The meaning of "mintor" and "designated mintor" have at all times
been the same, namely the mintor designated by the Rules.

Thus I rule that the statement was correctly judged TRUE.


Regards,
-- elJefe, Justiciar


=====================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

In CFJ 933, Elde Judges the Statement to be TRUE.

The reasons for thinking so are briefly outlined as follows :

* before 3533 passed, the Mint was a Nomic Entity
* the Mint was defined by Rule 1470
* 3533 amended 1470 so that it no longer defined the Mint
* by Rule 1586, the Mint ceased to exist
* at that time, the Mintor of VTs was still the Mint (1696)
* by Rule 1579, all VTs were therefore destroyed at that instant
* (thereafter, 1696 was amended to make the Bank the VT Mintor)

Rule 1579 stated :

      If the designated Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist or ceases
      to possess Mint Authority, all units of that Currency are
      destroyed and the Currency ceases to exist.

It has been suggested that Rule 1579 was at that time in conflict 
with Rule 1471, which stated

      The Mintor of a Currency may, at any time, destroy those units
      of that Currency which it currently possesses in its Treasury,
      so long as this destruction is permitted by the Rules.  Units of
      Currency may not be otherwise destroyed except as specifically
      authorized by the Rules.

separate support for this position being sought from this provision 
in Rule 1467 :

      Neither Currencies nor units of Currency shall be created or
      destroyed except as specified by the Rules.

It must be noted that Rule 1579's provisions both authorize, and
specify the manner of, the destruction of units of any Currency
falling under its purview; therefore, no conflict exists, precisely
because of both 1467's and 1471's conflict-avoiding provisions.

The Injunctions going with CFJ 1045 are hereby invalid until their Appeal
has been judged.

I regard this as 44(!) different Appeals, as there are 11 Officers (which I
read as meaning 'player holding an Office' at the moment, and there are
4 Injunctions for each.

============================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

In CFJ 1045, I find the Statement to be TRUE.

I am in essential agreement with the Caller that Rule 1563 provides
more than adequate justification for Dismissing the named CFJs, in
spite of some arduous wording which made it briefly tempting - given
the rewards of returning a Judgement on, rather than Dismiss, these
CFJs - to wriggle my way out of it.


But wait, there is more.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the sum total of
Payment Orders in Indulgences naming that Player as Payor that they
have thus far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the sum total of Payment
Orders in Voting Tokens naming that Player as Payor that they have
thus far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Proposal Notes equal to the sum total of
Payment Orders in Indulgences naming that Player as Payor that they
have thus far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to the Registrar, requiring em to issue, for each Player, a
Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, that Player as Payee, for an
amount of 5 VTs. (So we can Vote on Proposals, y'know...)

The above facially satisfy provisions i) through iv) of Rule 663
pertaining to Injunctions; it is my belief that they also satisfy v), 
though that requires us to examine any Rule relevant thereto. I
find one, Rule 1736 itself, which states

      The Rules may require, in certain cases, that a Judge issue an
      Injunction ordering the execution of a Payment Order.  If the
      Payment Order required by such an Injunction is executed, and
      the Injunction itself later set aside, the Player who executed
      the required Payment Order shall, as soon as possible after the
      Injunction was set aside, vacate that Payment Order.

This merely states that Rules are permitted to require Judges to
issue Injuctions under certain circumstances; it is as far as I can
see no bar to a Judge taking it upon emself to issue any legal
Injuction. No prohibition of any kind in fact obtains with respect
to issuing Injuctions defined in 1736/1737; the procedure for issuing
an Injunction is well delineated, and followed to a T in this
Judgement; issuing an Injunctions in the present circumstances is 
therefore possible and unprohibited, which I submit is all that 'in a 
manner consistent with the Rules' requires.

Lastly, a note as to intent - obviously, this loophole can be used
for massive personal gain (well, once the status of Currencies has
been determined), and just as obviously it will be extremely tempting
for other Players assigned to Judge CFJs to take advantage of it for
the same reasons. It could also be used to summarily deregister 
anyone from the Game by assigning them 31 Blots.

There is no limit to how far this could be abused; if everyone jumps
on that bandwagon, all we will do is spoil the game absolutely.
Better we should fix that loophole, and quick, and refrain from
doing anything else about it for the sake of preserving the game's
fun.

I think the above is even-handed enough that Players (especially
Justices or Judges with CFJs currently assigned to em) will see their
own interest in letting it stand at that.

(And remember, you ain't seen nothing yet.)

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:


Relevant Rules: 1563

Rule 1563/1 (Power=1)
Statement of a CFJ

      In order to be Judged, a Call for Judgement must contain a
      single clearly-labeled Statement which must be able to be
      determined by the means of logical reasoning, with the
      presumption of perfect knowledge, to be either TRUE or FALSE.
      Statements which are inherently contradictory or which are
      vacuous are not acceptable, and a CFJ containing such a
      Statement shall not be Judged.

      If a Call for Judgement does not contain a Statement of the sort
      required by this Rule, its Judge is required to dismiss the CFJ,
      as described elsewhere.

      It is permitted for a Call for Judgement to contain Arguments,
      Evidence, or other material placed there at the Caller's
      discretion.  However, the Judge is not required to take notice
      of any part of the CFJ other than the Statement in formulating
      eir Judgement.

Before I begin arguing, I'd like to say that when I refer to "the
statement", I refer to the statement "This statement is TRUE.", and when I
refer to "the CFJ", I'm referring to the CFJ I am submitting.  I'm keeping
this consistancy so that it's clear what I am talking about.

The statement "This statement is TRUE." cannot be determined to be either
TRUE or FALSE by means of logical reasoning.

If the statement is TRUE, then it follows that the statement is TRUE, and
there's no contradiction.  If the statement is FALSE, then it follows that
the statement is FALSE, and there's no contradiction.  Therefore, the
statement is both TRUE and FALSE and is not either TRUE or FALSE.

The statement is also vacuous, and is therefore not acceptable.

vacuous (vky-es) adjective
1.	Devoid of matter; empty.
2.	a. Lacking intelligence; stupid. b. Devoid of substance or meaning;
inane: a vacuous comment. c. Devoid of expression; vacant: "The narrow,
swinelike eyes were open, no more vacuous in death than they had been in
life" (Nicholas Proffitt).
3.	Lacking serious purpose or occupation; idle. See synonyms at EMPTY.
[From Latin vacuus, empty. See VACUUM.]
- vacuously adverb
- vacuousness noun

The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Third Edition
copyright  1992 by Houghton Mifflin Company. Electronic version licensed
from InfoSoft International, Inc. All rights reserved.

definitions 2b, 2c, and 3 all support the statement being vacuous.
definition 1 would imply an empty statement, like a null set, but then
there would be no statement to be vacuous, so definition 1 does not apply.
definition 2a is a matter of taste, so it does not apply.

The statement has not substance or meaning in game terms or in terms of
anything other than the statement.

I'd like to also note that this CFJ must be judged TRUE if it is determined
by the judge that the statement cannot be judged TRUE or FALSE by logical
reasoning or the statement is vacuous.  Either one of those being TRUE (or
both being true) makes this CFJ true.

Two important remarks on CFJ 1045:

As I have been notified, there are not 44, but 34 Injunctions with
CFJ 1045. Furthermore I hereby want it to be clear that my message
specifying the Appelate Court on this message should be read as 34
Assignments of these Appelate Judgements.

Furthermore this number of 34 is only correct if my count of 11
Officers is correct.

                               CFJ 1046

Calabresi is ineligible to serve as a Justice in the Appeal of CFJ 933.

Eligible:    Blob, Calabresi, ChrisM, Chuck, Crito, Elde,

Not eligible:
Caller:      Steve
Barred:      Andre

======================================================================

History:
  Called by Steve, timestamp lost
  Assigned to Michael, 1 Oct 1997 19:33:25 +0200 (MET DST)
  Judged TRUE by Michael, 3 Oct 1997 16:50:35 +0100

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Rule 911 states in part:

      A Player is ineligible for selection if any of the following is
      true:

       iv) E was ineligible to Judge the CFJ that resulted in the
           matter under consideration, and this restriction does not
           prevent three eligible Players from being selected by the
           CotC for the Board.

CFJ 933 was called on Aug 4, a week before Calabresi registered to
play. Calabresi was, therefore, ineligible to Judge the CFJ, and so
satisfies the criterion of R911(iv) for being ineligible to serve
as Justice.

Andre has argued that Calabresi was later eligible to serve as a
Judge when the CFJ was re-assigned after the initial Judge defaulted.
This is true, but it no way changes the fact that Calabresi was, at
one time, ineligible to serve as Judge, and so is ineligible to serve
as Justice. R911 does not say that a Player who was never eligible
to serve as Judge is ineligible to serve as Justice.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

Judgement: TRUE

Reasons and arguments: 

R911 spells out the conditions under which a Player is ineligible for
selection as Justice.  It is clear and undisputed by the Caller that
Calabresi doesn't satisfy conditions i, ii, iii or v.

The question remains: was Calabresi ineligible to Judge the original
CFJ?  If so, then they are ineligible to serve as Justice in the
Appeal of that CFJ by condition iv.

This question needs careful consideration.  In particular, what sense
are we to make of the "was" in condition iv?  

It's clearly ridiculous to claim that this refers to arbitrary
instants of time in history, as we were all ineligible to judge CFJs
before they were called, before we joined the game or before the game
started. 

In fact the wording of the relevant rules makes it clear the
eligibility is an attribute that should only be calculated when a CFJ
is assigned a Judge.  

Here we come to our next problem: when the CFJ was first assigned,
Calabresi was not a Player.  The rules do not explicitly discuss the
eligibility status of non-Players, so we have to turn to common-sense
and game custom to tell us that non-Players are not eligible as
Judges.   (The language of the Judge selection rule (R951) tells us
that Judges are to be selected from amongst eligible Players, not
necessarily implying that other classes of people are ineligible.
However, here the common-sense view of what it is to be eligible must
be appealed to, if it is impossible for one to be selected for
something because of one's status, this is equivalent to being
ineligible.)

Therefore Calabresi is ineligible to serve as a Justice in the appeal
of CFJ 933.

COE denied. I do not regard the phrase 'Judgement:' without a Judgement
following it as claiming the absence of a Judgement of TRUE, and thus I 
do not regard this phrase as a misrepresentation of the actual Gamestate.

======================================================================

                               CFJ 933

"All Voting Tokens were destroyed as a result of the Pragmatic
 Currencies Proposal taking effect."

======================================================================

To judge this statement, I asked myself a few questions:

Q:What was the state of the world before the Pragmatic Currencies Proposal?

A:The Mint, as defined by Rule 1470, was the Mintor of VTs.

Q: What changes to the game state were made as a result of this Proposal?

A:Rule 1470 was amended so it no longer defined the Mint and Rule 1696 was
amended to make the Bank the Mintor of VTs.

Q:What were the effects of this change?

A:Since the Mint was no longer defined, it ceased to exist, by Rule 1586.
At the time it ceased to exist, it was the Mintor of VTs. The Bank became
the Mintor of VTs.

Q:Were the VTs destroyed?

Rule 1579 states:

      If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist, or ceases to have
      the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that Currency
      are destroyed, and that Currency ceases to exist.

A:The Mintor of VTs was the Mint.  The Bank ceased to exist.  Therefore,
the Bank, being the Mintor of VTs, ceased to exist, so all VTs were
destroyed.  In my opinion, there was no instant in time when VTs did not
have a Mintor.  R1579, however, states that all units of a Currency are
destroyed "If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist".  It does not state
that they're destroyed "If a Currency does not have a Mintor".  These are
two very different phrases.

Q:Do the rules have authority to "interfere" in the execution of a
proposal?  Do the rules have the authority to stop a proposal in
mid-execution and change the game state?

A:The answer to this question does not alter the judgement of this CFJ.
Whether the rules interfered or not, the Mintor of VTs was destroyed.  The
rules did not make an exception in the case that a new Mintor of VTs was
defined.

I hereby rule that CFJ 933 was correctly judged TRUE.

This seems to be an easy call.  Rule 1695 asks us to consider whether the
injunction was both legal and appropriate.

      If the Board finds that the Injunction was made illegally,
      or that it was inappropriate for the situation, the
      Injunction shall be set aside. The original Judge is
      guilty of the Infraction of Wrongful Injunction, the
      penalty for which is 2 Blots; the CotC shall detect and
      report this penalty.

Whether or not the Injunctions were technically legal (which I doubt), it
is crystal clear to me that they were all _inappropriate_ for the situation
of the CFJ.  There is simply no reasonable way to connect the Statement
(that CFJs 945-970 and 972-1044 must be dismissed under Rule 1563) to the
Injunctions (that various Officers distribute currencies to the masses).

I'm not completely sure how to count the number of injunctions.  I agree
that there must be more than four, because each paragraph begins "I hereby
issue Injuctions..." (plural).  One interpretation is that each injunction
applied to the all the Officers named, but with one Injunction for each
Player, a total of 84 Injunctions.

But I'm willing to accept Andre's calculation.  If there are 34 separate
injunctions, is this 68 Blots for Morendil?  The voodoo lounge is about to
live up to its name even more.

Regards,
-- elJefe

That means 3 Injunctions for each of Morendil's first and third
paragraphs; 21 Injunctions for the last paragraph, plus whatever
Scott comes up with.

[...]

>============================================================

We believe that the Injunctions are all illegal. Judge Morendil claims that
his authority to issue the Injunctions is implied by Rule 1736 which says,
in part

      The Rules may require, in certain cases, that a Judge issue an
      Injunction ordering the execution of a Payment Order.

But we do not see how to get from this to saying that a Judge may issue
PO's in all cases.  "Certain cases" seems to need specifying by the Rules.
Absent this, it seems impossible for the Judge to establish that this is
one of the "certain cases" where he can issue a legal injunction.

Moreover, even if any of the Injunctions were technically legal, Rule 1695
asks us to consider whether the injunction was both legal and appropriate.

      If the Board finds that the Injunction was made illegally,
      or that it was inappropriate for the situation, the
      Injunction shall be set aside.

It is clear to this Board that they were all _inappropriate_ for the
situation of the CFJ. "Appropriate for the situation," in the clear sense
of the Rule, would mean that the injunction was a natural and expected
result of the Statement being found TRUE.  In this case there is simply no
reasonable way to connect the Statement (that CFJs 945-970 and 972-1044
must be dismissed under Rule 1563) to the Injunctions (that various
Officers distribute currencies to the masses).

THE BOARD THEREFORE FINDS THAT ALL THESE INJUNCTIONS WERE MADE ILLEGALLY,
AND/OR WERE INAPPROPRIATE FOR THE SITUATION. ACCORDINGLY THEY ARE ALL SET
ASIDE.

How many injunctions are there?

Looking at the actual wording of the Injunctions, it is clear that each
paragraph must refer to more than one injunction, as they begin "I hereby
issue Injuctions..." (plural).  We agree that the most natural reading of
the first 3 Injunctions is to count one Injunction for each current Officer
who has issued a Payment Order of the kind described.  For the last
injunction we prefer the reading of counting one Injunction per Player, or
21 Injunctions.

Four Officers have written PO's in Indulgences: General Chaos, Andre,
Zefram, and Crito.

Two Officers have written PO's in Voting Tokens:  CotC Andre (judgement
pay) and Registrar Zefram (salaries).  VT Posts by the Assessor were not
POs in situations where he was assuming authorization on the basis that
votes had been cast (which they had not).

This makes 4 + 2 + 4 + 21 = 31 injunctions overturned.  For each of these,
in the words of Rule 1695, "the original Judge is guilty of the Infraction
of Wrongful Injunction, the penalty for which is 2 Blots; the CotC shall
detect and report this penalty."

I have taken the liberty of writing a Judgement on all of our
behalves. I think it's important for us to avoid confusion in
the matter of how many Blots Morendil gets. If we all give
different answers, confusion will result. If you disagree with
my counting scheme, please tell me, and we can negotiate about it.
Note that the Judgement is incomplete: I'm seeking clarification from
Crito about Zefram, and I'm still waiting to hear from Scott. I hope
he gets back to me soon. Time is running out.

The below is only a provisional Judgement, not official.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

In accordance with R1695, the Board has been asked to consider the
legality and appropriateness of the Injunctions made by Morendil and
attached to his Judgement of CFJ 1045. In making those Injunctions,
Morendil considered arguments as to their legality; evidently he did
not consider the provisions in R1695 concerning appropriateness. His
omission is, however, our good fortune, for whatever the legal merits
of the Injunctions, and these are debatable, it is plain that the
Injunctions were inappropriate for the situation: they have nothing
whatsoever to do with the matter that Morendil was asked to consider
in his Judgement. R1695 is clear that inappropriate Injunctions are
to be set aside, and the Board is unanimous in so ordering.

This brings us to a far trickier matter: that of penalties. Making an
inappropriate Injunction is an Infraction, the Infraction of Wrongful
Injunction. According to R1695, the penalty for the commission of
this Infraction is 2 Blots. The question is: how many Injunctions did
Morendil Wrongfully make? To answer this difficult question, it will be
useful to have the text of the Injunctions before us:

      I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
      applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for
      every Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and
      that Player as Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the
      sum total of Payment Orders in Indulgences naming that Player
      as Payor that they have thus far executed and have not been
      satisfied.

      I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
      applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for
      every Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and
      that Player as Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the
      sum total of Payment Orders in Voting Tokens naming that Player
      as Payor that they have thus far executed and have not been
      satisfied.

      I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
      applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for
      every Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and
      that Player as Payee, for an amount of Proposal Notes equal to
      the sum total of Payment Orders in Indulgences naming that
      Player as Payor that they have thus far executed and have not
      been satisfied.

      I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
      applying to the Registrar, requiring em to issue, for each
      Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, that Player
      as Payee, for an amount of 5 VTs. (So we can Vote on Proposals,
      y'know...)

It would have been simpler, (and better for Morendil, as we shall
see), had we been able to count this as 4 Injunctions; however, 
the text of the Injunctions did not permit such a reading, as each
paragraph refers to multiple Injunctions. 

Abandoning this strategy, we took up a suggestion by Andre that each
paragraph be interpreted as making one Injunction for each current
Officer. This would have meant 15 Injunctions for each of the first
three paragraphs, and one Injunction in the last paragraph. This
suggestion has remained the heart of our counting strategy, although
we have had to modify it in various ways, described below:

1. It will not do to count the last paragraph as making only one
Injunction, for the same reasons as led us to reject the suggestion
that the first three paragraphs should be understood as each making
only one Injunction, namely, that the last paragraph also refers to
'Injunctions'. However, the last paragraph differs from the other
three in not seeking to enjoin each current Officer, but only the
Registrar.  Since the paragraph seeks to enjoin the Registrar to
issue one Payment Order for each Player, it makes sense to count this
paragraph as making 21 Injunctions on the Registrar, one for each
Player registered at the time the Injunctions were made (Elde had not
yet been deregistered for Lawlessness at that time).

2. It turns out that 15 is too high a count for the number of
Injunctions made in each of the first three paragraphs. R1596
states that:

      A Payment Order specifies exactly one source entity, exactly
      one destination entity, exactly one Currency, and a number of
      units of that Currency which is a positive multiple of that
      Currency's MUQ.

An Officer therefore cannot be enjoined to make a Payment Order
for zero units of a Currency, or at any rate, we choose to interpret
Morendil's Injunctions as not seeking to enjoin Officers to make
such POs. Our attention is therefore focussed on those of the
current Officers who have executed unsatisfied Payment Orders
which name a Player as Payor. The first and third paragraphs
concern POs for Indulgences; the second paragraph concerns POs
for Voting Tokens.

The Board has therefore made enquiries of the Recordkeepors of
Indulgences (Herald Crito), and Voting Tokens (Assessor General
Chaos), seeking answers to those questions. It appears that the
Chancellor, the Assessor, the CotC, the Herald and the Registrar
have executed unsatisfied Payments Orders for Indulgences naming
a Player as the Payor; [I'm still waiting to hear from the Assessor.]

It would appear, therefore that Morendil wrongfully made 5
Injunctions in the first paragraph, n in the second paragraph, 5 in
the third paragraph, and 21 in the last paragraph, for a total of
[31+n] Wrongful Injunctions. He therefore commits the Infraction of
Wrongful Injunction [31+n] times, and earns 2*[31+n] Blots, which
penalty is to be detected and reported by the Clerk of the Courts.

So ordered by the Board of Appeals:

Steve (Speaker)
elJefe (Justiciar)
Andre (CotC)

Sorry for the empty reply; I hit 'send' instead of 'edit'. Anyway,
this means a minor adjustment to my provisional Judgement. The first
and third paragraphs name only 4 Officers, not 5, and Morendil commits
[29+n] Infractions of Wrongful Injunction, not [31+n].

My decision on the Appeal of CFJ 933 is to SUSTAIN the original
Judgement, TRUE.

R&A:

First, I agree with Justice Vir that VTs were destroyed even
if the "atomic" paradigm (wherein a Proposal represents only
a single game state change, although the effects of that change
are as if the provisions were applied sequentially) were
the correct one; as well as with his basis for that decision.

As for the question of whether the "atomic" or "sequential"
paradigm is correct, I cannot decide--based on any of the
four preferred standards of Rule 217 (Game Custom, common sense,
past judgements, the best interests of the Game)--and since
I do not need to decide in order to judge this Appeal, I choose
not to.  However, I will make some lengthy comments on my
inability to decide. :)

I began writing these R&A with the intent of coming down
in favor of the sequential model.  Along those lines,
I had written:

>However, I agree with Steve that the annotations and Amendment
>Number of Rule 1551 establish a Game Custom that the "sequential"
>paradigm--wherein each provision of a Proposal is applied
>individually, and the Rules may act on the intermediate
>game states--is the preferred one.  (Rule 1551 counts
>two "amendments" from a single proposal as two distinct
>amendments.)
>
>First, I note that some have argued that even under the
>atomic (or, for that matter, the generally discredited
>simutaneous) paradigm, the two alleged amendments would
>still be two distinct amendments.  With this I disagree.
>"Amendment" is nowhere distinctly defined in the Rules,
>and thus it must have its normal English usage (possibly
>as modified by Game Custom)--which I (intuitively) take
>to mean "a change to the text of a Rule."  Given this
>definition, if the atomic paradigm held, two alleged
>amendments by a single proposal would in fact be
>only one amendment.  

However, I realized there is a flaw in this reasoning.
I will bring it up below, but there is another issue
I wish to address first.

>Second, the possibility has been raised that the Rulekeepor
>was in error in counting the two "amendments" of Rule
>1551 as two actual amendments, and e should have counted

>(This is also supported, I believe, by Rule 1575, "Standards
>of Proof".)

As I obliquely allude to above, not all Game Customs are
of equal strength.  Rule 217 provides four preferred
standards for judgement but does not (IMO) provide
any sort of order in which those standards should be
applied--a Judge is free to give precedence to whichever
standards e thinks best.  However, one thing a conscientious
Judge ought to consider, in deciding how to apply the
standards, is that some Game Customs are stronger than
other Game Customs.  A Judge might decide, for example,
that a strong Game Custom is to be preferred over common
sense, but common sense is to be preferred over a weak
Game Custom.  (This is a bit of an oversimplification--not
all common sense is equally strong, either.)

I will not go into a detailed dicussion of what constitutes
"strong" versus "weak" Game Custom, but there are two
issues which I believe are relevant.  First, how many
times has the Game Custom been applied?  A Game Custom
applied dozens of times is stronger than one applied only
once or twice.  Second, how carefully has the Game Custom
been scrutinized in the past?  A Game Custom which led to
a win, for example, or a player deregistration, is likely
to have been very carefully scrutinized, and thus is stronger
than a Game Custom with no major effects, which may not
have been closely scrutinized.

Returning to the issue at hand, we find that we have
only a very weak Game Custom supporting the sequential
view--there is only one example (Rule 1551), and amendment
numbers and Rule annotations are not likely to be closely
scrutinized.  However, even a weak Game Custom can
be decisive, if none of the other standards of Rule 217
apply.  There are no (to my knowledge) past judgements
on this issue, and common sense does not seem to prefer
either view over the other.  I personally hold the
"best interests of the game" standard in low regard,
and choose to place even a weak Game Custom above this
standard, but even if I did not, I do not see that
either one of TRUE or FALSE would be better for the
game than the other.

And so I was about to argue that the sequential view was
the correct one, as noted in my first quoted argument,
until I realized the flaw.  (Note that the second
argument, concerning the possibility of Rulekeepor
error, hinges on the first: if the atomic view can
support counting two alleged amendments in a single
proposal as two actual amendments, the second argument
is irrelevant.)

I wrote that since "Amendment" was not clearly defined
in the Rules, it had to be given its normal definition
of "a change to the text of a Rule."  However, this
does not fit with another Game Custom--the custom
that a Null-Amendment is a valid, legal Amendment.
This, IMO, is a moderately strong Game Custom--although
it also resides in the poorly-scrutinized area of
Amendment Numbers and Rule Annotations, it has been applied
many times.  Given this, we cannot define "Amendment"
simply as "a change to the text of a Rule."  A likely
definition is "Any alleged amendment to the text of a
Rule by a Rule or adopted Proposal, not prohibited by
the Rules."  Given this definition, two alleged amendments by a 
single Proposal may be two actual amendments, even under
the atomic view.

Thus, I find no reason to prefer the sequential model to
the atomic, or vice versa, under any of the preferred standards
of Rule 217.  If this CFJ hinged on that issue, I would have
to make a decision based on any other standards I cared to
apply, but since it does not (VTs are destroyed in both
models), I leave the issue to future CFJs (or, perhaps
preferably, legislation).


Additional Evidence: Rules 217, 1551, and 1575.

Rule 217/3 (Power=1)
Judgements Must Accord with the Rules

      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however,
      if the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the
      Statement to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider game
      custom, commonsense, past Judgements, and the best interests of
      the game before applying other standards.

 Game Custom.]

Rule 1551/4 (Power=1)
Documents Subject to Ratification

      The ratification of an Official Document conforms the Game State
      to what it would be if the valid Official Document thus ratified
      was completely true and accurate at the time of the Document's
      publication in the Public Forum.  In other words, the State of
      the Game, upon such ratification, becomes that specified within
      the Document, plus all subsequent legal changes between the time
      of its publication and its ratification.

      All Game State changes due to the ratification of an Official
      Document occur at the time of such ratification; no retroactive
      effect is expressed or implied.

      A Document, once ratified, is for all legal purposes a true and
      accurate report.  The Game State it references may not be
      retroactively modified prior to the time it was published in the
      Public Forum, even to reflect a prior mistake, retracted or
      illegal move, or an Injunction.  This Rule takes precedence over
      any Rule that would allow such retroactive alterations or
      corrections to the Game State.

      In no way does the ratification of a Document invalidate,
      reverse, alter or cancel any prior moves or transfers, even
      unrecorded or overlooked ones.  Nor does the ratification of a
      Document change the legality or illegality of any prior move.
      Ratification only adjusts the actual Game State to conform to
      that perceived by the Players and Officers in Official
      Documentation.

      After a Document has been ratified, the Player in charge of
      maintaining that Document shall annotate all subsequent
      publications of that Document with the date of publication of
      the last such publication that was ratified..

Looking at Morendil's Injunctions again, I see the need to clarify
my request to you. The Injunction concerning VT Payment Orders 
states:

      I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
      applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for
      every Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and
      that Player as Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the
      sum total of Payment Orders in Voting Tokens naming that Player
      as Payor that they have thus far executed and have not been
      satisfied.

It occurs to me that, say, Registrar Zefram will have executed many
unsatisfied POs for VTs - all eir Salary Reports, for instance - but
that all of these POs name the Bank as Payor, not a Player. If
Registrar Zefram has never issued a PO for VTs naming a Player as
Payor, then the above will not result in his having been enjoined to
do anything. And likewise for the other Officers. (Now that I think
of it, though, it seems likely that Registrar Zefram has executed POs
for VTs naming a Player as Payor, in the course of reporting
penalties for Failure to Report.)

Any just to be clear, my query to you is officially this: how many
of the current Officers have executed unsatisfied POs for VTs naming
a Player as the Payor?

    "General Chaos committed the Crime of Wrongful COE denial."

Injunction: 

By R1504/5 I am required to enjoin the Clerk of the Courts to execute
whatever Payment Orders are necessary to penalise General Chaos for
the Crime he has committed.  (R1431 states that Wrongful COE denial is
a Class 1 Crime, and R1505 states that such crimes bear a 1 Blot
penalty.)

======================================================================

History:
  Called by Morendil, 27 Sep 1997 03:15:17 +0100
  Assigned to Michael, as of this message

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

> You would prefer that I ignore the obvious and direct meaning as
> being a Transfer Order for 4 VTs in favor of the less obvious,
> indirect meaning as being 2 Transfer Orders for 2 VTs each? 
> Please. COE denied.  Further, I transfer one Kudo from Morendil for
> making such a baseless COE, to Harlequin, for being the unfortunate
> victim of circumstance. 

For one thing, that is precisely what I expect you to do - the Courts
have been working overtime to establish that implicit specifications
in the wording of Orders were to be given due consideration, and
Harlequin's request for a transfer is worded so that it was well
within your authority, given this judicial basis, to interpret it as
two successful distinct TOs. Note that Harlequin's request did not
purport to be one TO for 4 VTs, but merely requested that you note a
Transfer or Transfers for a total of 4 VTs; given that the POs this
aimed to satisfy were explicitly listed, your contention that the
'obvious and direct' intent was as a TO for an amount of 4 VTs
simply makes no sense.

For another thing, "unfortunate victim of circumstance", together
with your statement that "The Bank gratefully appreciates your
donation", strikes me as very cynical.

I'll let the Agoran community take appropriate steps, if they so
wish, to compensate for the injurious Kudo transfer above; however,
your behaviour as an Officer should be subject to formal scrutiny
and I therefore submit the following CFJ :

===
General Chaos committed the Crime of Wrongful COE denial.
===

======================================================================

Reasons and arguments Judge:

This Judge finds that, in stating that Harlequin's message "I transfer
4 VTs to the Bank, to satisfy VT POs 1040 and 1041" failed to satisfy
payment orders VT1040 and VT1041, and then denying a COE asserting the
opposite, General Chaos committed the Crime of Wrongful COE denial.

As the caller of the CFJ claims, it is legitimate to interpret
statements such as Harlequin's generously, to wit that the transfer
made be considered two separate Transfer Orders, one for each of the
two Payment Orders he was required to satisfy. 

This is in line with recent judicial (and appelate) decisions which
allow Transfer and Payment Orders to be made implicitly, and
represents a welcome shift towards a less pedantic style of play.

Michael.

Decision Judge:

I hereby Judge as follows:

1001: TRUE

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Speaker:

I hereby overturn Zefram's Judgements of CFJ 998 and 1001, in each
case ruling instead for dismissal. Judge Zefram was required by R1563
and by Rule 1565(iii) and (vi) to dismiss the CFJs.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Justiciar:

Decision of the Justiciar:  DISMISS  (vacating the Judgement)

I find the Judgement incorrect:  the CFJ should be dismissed under Rule
1565(iii), as the statement does not relate to matters relevant to the
Rules.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning CotC:

As for the statements of both CFJ 998 and CFJ 1001 the truth or falsity
cannot be determined by logical reasoning, and the statement also does
not relate to a matter relevant to the rules, I OVERTURN the Judgement,
and call for Dismissal of these CFJs. I also remark that the Judgements in
most other CFJs between 945 and 1044, and CFJ 1045, show that the
majority of Agorans agrees with this.

In reply to my request for evidence, I received a reply from Scott 
which list all the unsatisfied VT POs. I've edited this down drastically
to show just the current Officers, and just the POs naming a Player as
Payor.

So we can take Morendil's second paragraph as making two Injunctions.
Now, we wait only for Crito's to report back on Zefram.

Oops! Michael is *not* currently the CotC - doh! So the second paragraph
makes only one Injunction.

I appeal this decision.  The claim made in the Claim of Error
referenced was incorrect; my claim that the Transfer Order attempted
by Harlequin failed to satisfy the POs in question is true, insofar as
that Transfer Order failed to be successfully executed; thus, I was
correct in denying Morendil's claim that Harlequin's Transfer Order
succeeded in satisfying Payment Orders VT1026 and VT1027.

I hereby Call for Judgement on the following Statement:

     Morendil is Elde's Executor in Probate.

I hereby Call for Judgement on the following Statement:

     Morendil is Elde's Executor.

I hereby Call for Judgement on the following Statement:

     Elde is Blob's Executor in Probate.

I hereby Call for Judgement on the following Statement:

     Either Blob's Executor is emself, or Blob has no Executor.

Reasons and arguments for all of these CFJs:

Morendil becomes Elde's EiP.
Rule 1738 says that Elde's EiP is eir Executor, so Morendil is Elde's
  Executor and succeeds in reregistering Elde.
Elde becomes Blob's EiP.
By a similar argument, Elde is Blob's Executor and succeeds in reregistering
  Blob.
Elde is deregistered.
No Rule states that a Player who is deregistered loses eir Executor or EiP,
  so Morendil is still Elde's Executor and EiP.
Rule 1478's statement that Executors must be Players takes precedence over
  Rule 1738's claim that Blob's EiP (Elde) is eir Executor, so Elde is no
  longer Blob's Executor.
However, no Rule states that an EiP who is deregistered ceases to be EiP,
  so Elde is still Blob's EiP.

When Elde ceased to be Blob's Executor, e did not cease to be Blob's EiP -
precisely because the equality of EiP and Executor (which exists only
because Rule 1738 says so) is broken by way of Rule 1478 starting to take
precedence over Rule 1738.

                               CFJ 1048

		    "The Rules lack agency"

======================================================================

Judge:       Steve

Judgement:   FALSE

Eligible:    Andre, Blob, Calabresi, ChrisM, Chuck, Crito, Elde, 
	     elJefe, General Chaos, Harlequin, Kolja A., Michael, 
             Murphy, Steve, Vir, Zefram

Not eligible:
Caller:      Vlad
Barred:      Morendil, Oerjan
On request:  Vanyel
On hold:     Swann

======================================================================

History:
  Called by Vlad, 30 Sep 1997 17:19:46 -0500 (CDT)
  Assigned to Steve, 2 Oct 1997 14:18:49 +0200 (MET DST)
  Judged FALSE by Steve, 3 Oct 1997 17:42:45 +1000 (EST)

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

The Rules derive their authority from the General Will of all
the Players. Any appearance of agency then seem to have is derived from
that authority. 

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

I Judge that the Statement is FALSE.

The Statement is rather vague, but I intend to interpret it as
seeking to establish whether the game state ever changes except as
the result of human action. Game Custom is clear on this point. We
have many examples of self-repealing and self-amending Rules, not to
mention Proposals which have altered the game state in various ways
(cf RGB II). It may well be, as Vlad claims, that the ability of such
Rules and Proposals to act in the way they do is derivative of human
decisions to give the Rules authority. But it remains true that we
have granted such authority to the Rules. Derivative agency is still
agency.

Rule 1736 says:

      The Rules may require, in certain cases, that a Judge issue an
      Injunction ordering the execution of a Payment Order.  If the
      Payment Order required by such an Injunction is executed, and
      the Injunction itself later set aside, the Player who executed
      the required Payment Order shall, as soon as possible after the
      Injunction was set aside, vacate that Payment Order.

That is, the Rules may require that a Judge issues such an Injunction.
This Rule does not require, or even allow, such an Injunction on itself.
It just says what should happen would another Rule require it. However, 
at the moment, no Rule does so require in any case, and certainly not in 
the case at hand, so these Injunctions are illegal.

Furthermore, even if the Injunction would be legal, I still regard it as
inappropriate, so even in that case I have enough reason to set it aside.

I hereby ask for setting aside all the Injunctions.

Is this the kind of Appeal that needs 3 Players, or is your 
insistence sufficient in this case?

In any case: I hereby call for the Appeal of CFJ 1047.

I spoke with Zefram; it appears the only POs for Injunctions he has
issued naming a Player as Payor were issued after the CFJ 1045 Injunctions
were made. 

This makes the total number of Injunctions issued by Morendil come
to 4 + 1 + 4 + 21 = 30 (counting the Assessor and Chancellor separately).

If I haven't heard from you before 5pm Melbourne time, I'll issue my
own Judgement (otherwise I'll miss the deadline), with that count.

This is the official decision of the Justiciar in this case.

Steve, I'm sorry the timezones didn't work out for us to be able to write a
common decision, but your final calculation of the officers reached me at
2:00am, and I just read it.

I also disagree slightly with your interpretation.  The Injunctions pertain
to Officers; Officers are players (r1006), and there are but three players
involved, though one holds two of the relevant Offices.  Thus I calculate 3
+ 1 + 3 + 21 Injunctions.

>============================================================

Decision of the Justiciar:  All the Injunctions were incorrect and should
be set aside.


I believe that the Injunctions are all illegal. Judge Morendil claims that
his authority to issue the Injunctions is implied by Rule 1736 which says,
in part

      The Rules may require, in certain cases, that a Judge issue an
      Injunction ordering the execution of a Payment Order.

But I do not see how to get from this to saying that a Judge may issue PO's
in all cases.  "Certain cases" seems to need specifying by the Rules.
Absent this, it seems impossible for the Judge to establish that this is
one of the "certain cases" where he can issue a legal injunction.

Moreover, even if any of the Injunctions were technically legal, Rule 1695
asks us to consider whether the injunction was both legal and appropriate.

      If the Board finds that the Injunction was made illegally,
      or that it was inappropriate for the situation, the
      Injunction shall be set aside.

It is clear that the Injunctions were all inappropriate for the situation
of the CFJ.  "Appropriate for the situation," in the clear sense of the
Rule, would mean that the injunction was a natural and expected result of
the Statement being found TRUE.  In this case there is simply no reasonable
way to connect the Statement (that CFJs 945-970 and 972-1044 must be
dismissed under Rule 1563) to the Injunctions (that various Officers
distribute currencies to the masses).


I therefore find that all these Injunctions were made illegally, and/or
were inappropriate for the situation.  Accordingly they should all be set
aside.


How many injunctions are there?

Looking at the actual wording of the Injunctions, there is a clear
presumption that each paragraph refer to more than one injunction, as they
begin "I hereby issue Injuctions..." (plural).  We agree that the most
natural reading of the first 3 Injunctions is to count one Injunction for
each current Officer who has issued a Payment Order of the kind described.
For the last injunction we prefer the reading of counting one Injunction
per Player, or 21 Injunctions.

Three Officers have written PO's from players in Indulgences: General
Chaos, Andre, and Crito.

One current Officer has written a PO from a player in Voting Tokens:
Assessor General Chaos (in a PO which is now vacated).

This makes 3 + 1 + 3 + 21 = 28 injunctions overturned.  For each of these,
in the words of Rule 1695, "the original Judge is guilty of the Infraction
of Wrongful Injunction, the penalty for which is 2 Blots; the CotC shall
detect and report this penalty."

With apologies to Jeff; I've run out of time - the deadline is 2am
tomorrow morning local time, and this is probably the last time
I'll be logged in before then.

H. Cotc Andre!

The following is my Official Judgement of the Appeal of the Injunctions
attached to CFJ 1045.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

In accordance with R1695, the Board has been asked to consider the
legality and appropriateness of the Injunctions made by Morendil and
attached to his Judgement of CFJ 1045. In making those Injunctions,
Morendil considered arguments as to their legality; evidently he did
not consider the provisions in R1695 concerning appropriateness. His
omission is, however, our good fortune, for whatever the legal merits
of the Injunctions, and these are debatable, it is plain that the
Injunctions were inappropriate for the situation: they have nothing
whatsoever to do with the matter that Morendil was asked to consider
in his Judgement. R1695 is clear that inappropriate Injunctions are
to be set aside, and my Judgement is that it be so ordered.

This brings us to a far trickier matter: that of penalties. Making an
inappropriate Injunction is an Infraction, the Infraction of Wrongful
Injunction. According to R1695, the penalty for the commission of
this Infraction is 2 Blots. The question is: how many Injunctions did
Morendil Wrongfully make? To answer this difficult question, it will be
useful to have the text of the Injunctions before us:

      I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
      applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for
      every Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and
      that Player as Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the
      sum total of Payment Orders in Indulgences naming that Player
      as Payor that they have thus far executed and have not been
      satisfied.

      I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
      applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for
      every Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and
      that Player as Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the
      sum total of Payment Orders in Voting Tokens naming that Player
      as Payor that they have thus far executed and have not been
      satisfied.

      I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
      applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for
      every Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and
      that Player as Payee, for an amount of Proposal Notes equal to
      the sum total of Payment Orders in Indulgences naming that
      Player as Payor that they have thus far executed and have not
      been satisfied.

      I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
      applying to the Registrar, requiring em to issue, for each
      Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, that Player
      as Payee, for an amount of 5 VTs. (So we can Vote on Proposals,
      y'know...)

It would have been simpler, (and better for Morendil, as we shall
see), had we been able to count this as 4 Injunctions; however, 
the text of the Injunctions did not permit such a reading, as each
paragraph refers to multiple Injunctions. 

Abandoning this strategy, we took up a suggestion by Andre that each
paragraph be interpreted as making one Injunction for each current
Officer. This would have meant 15 Injunctions for each of the first
three paragraphs, and one Injunction in the last paragraph. This
suggestion has remained the heart of our counting strategy, although
we have had to modify it in various ways, described below:

1. It will not do to count the last paragraph as making only one
Injunction, for the same reasons as led us to reject the suggestion
that the first three paragraphs should be understood as each making
only one Injunction, namely, that the last paragraph also refers to
'Injunctions'. However, the last paragraph differs from the other
three in not seeking to enjoin each current Officer, but only the
Registrar.  Since the paragraph seeks to enjoin the Registrar to
issue one Payment Order for each Player, it makes sense to count this
paragraph as making 21 Injunctions on the Registrar, one for each
Player registered at the time the Injunctions were made (Elde had not
yet been deregistered for Lawlessness at that time).

2. It turns out that 15 is too high a count for the number of
Injunctions made in each of the first three paragraphs. R1596
states that:

      A Payment Order specifies exactly one source entity, exactly
      one destination entity, exactly one Currency, and a number of
      units of that Currency which is a positive multiple of that
      Currency's MUQ.

An Officer therefore cannot be enjoined to make a Payment Order
for zero units of a Currency, or at any rate, we choose to interpret
Morendil's Injunctions as not seeking to enjoin Officers to make
such POs. Our attention is therefore focussed on those of the
current Officers who have executed unsatisfied Payment Orders
which name a Player as Payor. The first and third paragraphs
concern POs for Indulgences; the second paragraph concerns POs
for Voting Tokens.

The Board has therefore made enquiries of the Recordkeepors of
Indulgences (Herald Crito), and Voting Tokens (Assessor General
Chaos), seeking answers to those questions. It appears that the
Chancellor, the Assessor, the CotC and the Herald have executed
unsatisfied Payments Orders for Indulgences naming a Player as the
Payor; the only current Officer to have executed an unsatisfied
Payment Order for VTs naming a Player as Payor is the Assessor,
General Chaos.

It would appear, therefore that Morendil wrongfully made 4
Injunctions in the first paragraph, 1 in the second paragraph, 4 in
the third paragraph, and 21 in the last paragraph, for a total of
30 Wrongful Injunctions. He therefore commits the Infraction of
Wrongful Injunction 30 times, and earns 60 Blots, which penalty is to
be detected and reported by the Clerk of the Courts.

Oops! Michael is *not* currently the CotC - doh! So the second paragraph
makes only one Injunction.

  Assigned to Michael, as of this message

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments

I hereby call for Judgement on the statement: "Elde is in violation of Rule
478 in that e is not able to receive messages sent to the Public Forum."
barring Morendil & Blob.  Relevant Rules: R478

======================================================================

Evidence:
1. R 478 (excerpt)
2. Registrar's Report (excerpt)
3. members of list agora-business@gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au

R478 (in part)

      It is the responsibility of each Active Player to ensure that e
      is able to receive messages sent to every medium which the
      Registrar has designated as a Public Forum.  The temporary
      inability of a Player to receive a Public Forum does not deprive
      that medium of any legal significance as a Public Forum.

The CFJ numbered 1048 which I posted a few minutes ago, should have
been numbered 1049. This is a COE, which I hereby admit. The corrected
part of the message should read:

======================================================================

                               CFJ 1049

	"Elde is in violation of Rule 478 in that e is not 
         able to receive messages sent to the Public Forum."

======================================================================

Also the subject should read 'CFJ 1049 Assignment: Michael'.
