Text of Adopted Proposals
======================================================================
Proposal 3844 (Blob) AI = 1
Flexible Unemployment Benefits

Amend Rule 1858 to read:

      As soon as possible after the beginning of each month, the
      Registrar shall pay out to every Player who does not receive any
      Officer's Salary for the previous month an unemployment benefit.

      The value of the unemployment benefit is a proportion of the
      Basic Officer Salary, the same for all Players. It can be set
      by the Registrar by announcing in the Public Forum that e is doing
      so, provided that e announces a value between 0% and 100% inclusive
      in units of 10%, and that e makes the announcement before the 25th
      day of the month.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal 3845 (General Chaos) AI = 3
Summary Adoption

Be it resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 3, to read:

      (a) The Proposer of any Proposal may cause it to be Adopted
          Without Objection, but only if the Proposal has not yet been
          distributed.

      (b) A Proposal Adopted Without Objection is Adopted at the time
          its Proposer changes its status to Adopted in accordance
          with the procedure for performing changes Without Objection,
          but only if at that time that Proposal has not yet been
          distributed.

      (c) When a Proposal is Adopted Without Objection, it is removed
          from the Queue.

      (d) A Proposal Adopted Without Objection is considered to be
          Disinterested.   

      (e) This Rule takes precedence over:
        (1) any Rule which would prevent a Proposal from being Adopted
            Without Objection;
        (2) any Rule which would prevent a Proposal Adopted Without
            Objection from being removed from the Proposal Queue; and 
        (3) any Rule which would prevent a Proposal Adopted Without   
            Objection from being considered Disinterested.
