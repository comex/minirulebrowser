Rule 1513 ends with this text:

     Especially, no body of text is permitted to require Players to
     perform or not perform any actions unless said body of text has
     previously been made available to that Player.

This says "Text T can bind Player P only if P has read T"; it does not
say "Text T can bind Player P only if the Rules require that P can
receive a copy of T".

The provision in R1504 which states that:

      Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their
      legal report, and the Player making the report of the Infraction
      shall execute whatever Payment Order(s) are required to apply
      the penalty specified for that Infraction. 

should be interpreted such that penalties for Infractions are applied
immediately upon the legal report of the *penalties*, not the legal
report of the Infractions.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

I reproduce as my argument the one I gave for the same conclusion
in my Judgement of CFJ 937:

"It's worth commenting at this point on an ambiguity in R1504: it's
not clear whether the report of the Infraction and the report of the
gain in Blots have to be made in the same message, or whether the
report of gain in Blots can follow the report of the Infraction by up
to seven days. The first sentence [sic] of R1504 states that
"Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their legal
report". But the legal report of what: the penalties or the
infractions? If infractions is meant, R1504 is somewhat in tension
with itself, since it immediately goes on to imply (along with other
Rules, eg R1599) that the application of the penalty can be later
than the report of the Infraction. So I read R1504 as saying that
penalties for Infractions are applied at the time the penalty is
reported, which can be later than the time the Infraction is reported."

Requested Injunction:

I request that the Judge of the CFJ issue an Injunction requesting
the Rulekeepor to annotate R1504 with the statement and the list
of relevant Rules below, as e is permitted to do by R789.

Relevant Rules: 1504, 1599

                               CFJ 940

Rule 1596 should be interpreted so that a message purporting to
be a Payment Order must, in order to satisfy that Rule's requirements
and qualify as a legal Payment Order, explicitly and unambiguously
state that the purported Payor is ordered to effect a payment as
a consequence of that message, e.g. by stating "Player X is commanded
to pay Y", the mere mention of an amount of a Currency, the name or
names of the Payor and Payee, or a reference to some Rule or some
situation that requires a Payment Order to be executed being
insufficient for a message not containing such a command or entreaty
to qualify as a Payment Order.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

I believe this follows from Rule 1596's definition of a Payment Order
as "an order requiring an entity to" perform some action, and that no
message not framed as a command is a legal Payment Order.

Note that the claim that a particular message _is_ a Payment Order
is by that reasoning sufficient to satisfy Rule 1596's requirement.

I kindly request that the Judge of the CFJ enjoin the Rulekeepor to
annotate R1596 with the above statement and the list of relevant
Rules which follows : 1596.

Proposal 3550 (Andre) AI = 1.5 

Viral Antidote

For the purpose of this Proposal 'protecting a Rule' will be synonymous to:
- if the Rule contains a paragraph with the text:

      This Rule, apart from this paragraph, shall be completely
      without effect. Two weeks after this paragraph is inserted into
      this Rule, this paragraph shall be deleted from this Rule.

   amending it by removing every instance of such a paragraph from the rule,
   and changing its Power to 1.5
- if the Rule does not contain such a paragraph, changing its power to 1.5.

If this Proposal is accepted, it protects the following Rules:

208 (End of the Voting Period)
376 (When Proposals Take Effect)
594 (Proposals and Rule Changes)
683 (Legal Votes)
693 (Prescribed Voting Period)
879 (Quorum)

1647 (Office of the Speaker-Elect)

Also, this Proposal, if accepted, amends Rule 1647, by adding, after "The
Speaker can never hold the Office of Speaker-Elect, even temporarily.", the
text:
   "If the Speaker ceases to be a Player, or ceases to be the Speaker for
    any other reason, the Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker, unless the Rules
    specify otherwise."

----------------------------------------------------------------------

(remark: This Proposal is meant to protect our main systems from the Virus.
 The Rules are upmutated to protect the making of and voting on Proposals
 (first group), Voting Tokens (second group), Calling for Judgement,
 delivering it and appealing it (third group), the possibility of registering
 (Rule 869) and the existence of Officers and of a well-defined Speaker (rest
 of last group plus added text).

The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of
a VOC directive was the report published in the PF on 1996/08/13
(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

As far as I know, no Herald's Report has ever been subject to
the adoption of a VOC directive.

COE: Herald's Report as of 8 September 1997

I noticed that the latest batch of Indulgence POs were misnumbered.  This is a
COE which I admit, and append a corrected report for the conveninece of those
depending on PO numbers. The correction of Morendil's COE is also included,
since as of this message I hereby vacate POI060, the one that should have been
referenced in my message admitting that claim.

The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of
a VOC directive was the report published in the PF on 1996/08/13
(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

As far as I know, no Herald's Report has ever been subject to
the adoption of a VOC directive.

I remind the Speaker, General Chaos, that the Nominating Period in
the Registrar Election concluded at Mon, 08 Sep 1997 02:54:17 -0500,
with Zefram as the only candidate.

This, then, is an unofficial notice, which the Speaker should officially
confirm, that Zefram became the Registrar as of that time.

However, in accordance with R1445, I remain responsible for Elections
initiated while I was still Registrar. I therefore make the following
announcements:

The Nominating Periods in the Elections for the Offices of Archivist,
Clerk of the Courts, Commander-in-Chief, Herald, Notary, and Rulekeepor
concluded at Mon, 08 Sep 1997 16:51:11 +1000 (EST).

Vanyel was the only Candidate for Archivist; Crito was the only
Candidate for Herald; Chuck was the only Candidate for Rulekeepor. In
each of these Elections, the single Candidate was Elected by
Acclamation as of the close of Nominations. These Players hold their
Offices in the normal fashion and their Terms of Service will expire
on 01 Jan 1998.

Kolja A. and Andre nominated for Clerk of the Courts; Harlequin and
Vlad nominated for Commander-in-Chief; Murphy and Morendil nominated
for Notary. In each of these Elections, voting commences as of this
message, and will last one week. Send votes to me.

ex-Registrar but still Vote Collector Steve
