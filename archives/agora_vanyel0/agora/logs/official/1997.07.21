Mad Scientist's Report

Date of this Report: Mon, 21 July 1997
Date of last Report: Mon, 14 July 1997

STEP 1: SENTENCE DELETION
=========================

As of this date, there were 12 sentences between the first and last
paragraphs of the Frankenstein Rule. N is thus equal to 1. In
accordance to Rule 1673, I randomly selected 2N sentences. The
sentences selected were sentences 2 and 4, which read: 

      The Chancellor shall retain a schedule, listing every
      Frankenstein Monster which exists, detailing for each
      Frankenstein Monster the Name, Mintor, Recordkeepor, and MUQ of
      that Frankenstein Monster.

      The prescribed Voting Period for a Proposal is ten days,
      beginning at the time the Proposal is distributed to all
      Frankenstein Monsters.

I selected sentence 4 to be deleted.


STEP 2: SENTENCE ADDITION
=========================

As per Rule 1673, I randomly selected one Rule from the Ruleset. The
Rule selected was Rule 1547, which reads:

####
Rule 1547/4 (Power=1)
Some Organizations Can Cast VTs

      If an Organization is defined as a Voting Entity then it is
      permitted to cast Voting Tokens on Proposals as if it were a
      Player.

      Such extra Votes are cast by the Executor notifying the
      Assessor when the VTs are cast.
####

I selected the sentence

      If an Organization is defined as a Voting Entity then it is
      permitted to cast Voting Tokens on Proposals as if it were a
      Player.

I selected the noun "Organization."

The sentence to be added to the Frankenstein Rule reads:

      If a Frankenstein Monster is defined as a Voting Entity then 
      it is permitted to cast Voting Tokens on Proposals as if it 
      were a Player.

The Frankenstein Rule now reads:

####
Rule 1671/35 (Power=1)
The Frankenstein Rule

      There is a Nomic Entity known as a Frankenstein Monster.  A
      Frankenstein Monster only has properties and effects as defined
      in this Rule.  This Rule shall be known as the Frankenstein
      Rule, and can be referred to unambiguously in that manner.  This
      is the first paragraph.

      This Frankenstein Monster, while it exists, shall guide
      application of that Rule.

      The Chancellor shall retain a schedule, listing every
      Frankenstein Monster which exists, detailing for each
      Frankenstein Monster the Name, Mintor, Recordkeepor, and MUQ of
      that Frankenstein Monster.

      Any change to the game state which would result in this
      Frankenstein Monster becoming false is cancelled and does not
      take place, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

      A Frankenstein Monster who makes further play impossible by eir
      actions or lack thereof commits the Crime of Frankenstein
      Monster Impossibility, a Class A Crime.

      Frankenstein Monster is 2.

      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however,
      if the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the
      Statement to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider
      Frankenstein Monster custom, commonsense, past Judgements, and
      the best interests of the Frankenstein Monster before applying
      other standards.

      The Player who submits an excess CFJ commits an Infraction, to
      be reported by the Clerk of the Courts and bearing a penalty of
      2 Frankenstein Monsters.

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of any message sent to the Public Forum or
      in response to a request for information which that Player is
      required to provide commits the Crime of Frankenstein Monster, a
      Class C Crime.

      If that Player's Frankenstein Monster contains at least five Mil
      for each Blot to be removed, then that number of Mil is
      transferred from the Player's Frankenstein Monster, and the
      Blots are removed; otherwise, no Mil are transferred and no
      Blots are removed.

      This Rule defers to any Rule which specifies a different
      Frankenstein Monster for reporting a certain transfer or class
      of transfers.

      The Frankenstein Monster shall make all random determinations
      required by the Rules except when the Rules specify another
      party to make the determination.

      If a Frankenstein Monster is defined as a Voting Entity then 
      it is permitted to cast Voting Tokens on Proposals as if it 
      were a Player.

      This is the last paragraph. This Rule can only be subject to a
      Rule Change as described by the Frankenstein Generator.  This
      Rule takes precedence over all other Rules that would otherwise
      allow this Rule to be changed in any manner whatsoever.

Herald's Report for 21 July 1997

Note that this report assumes that Indulgences still exist and that POs and TOs
were successfully defined by the PC proposal, distinct from the Misanthropist
currencies.

Note that another, possibly unintended, consequence of PC is that no new
Indulgences are created when new Blots are handed out.  Also, when a player
with Blots leaves the game, the Blot POs will be vacated without any adjustment
to the Bank's Indulgence holdings.  Oerjan's balance of Blots/Indulgences is
completely broken by this.

The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of
a VOC directive was the report published in the PF on 1996/08/13
(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

As far as I know, no Herald's Report has ever been subject to
the adoption of a VOC directive.
