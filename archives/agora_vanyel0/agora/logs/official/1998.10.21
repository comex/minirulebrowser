                               CFJ 1108

 The requirement to "execute a Payment Order for 0 VTs" can be fulfilled
 by doing nothing.

Eligible:     Antimatter, Blob, Crito, Chuck, General Chaos, Harlequin,
              Macross, Michael, Morendil, Oerjan, Steve

Not eligible:

======================================================================

History:

  Called by Kolja A.:     Tue, 20 Oct 1998 12:11:23 +0200
  Assigned to Morendil:   Wed, 21 Oct 1998 10:37:51 +1000 
  Morendil Judges TRUE:   Wed, 21 Oct 1998 11:15:07 +0200
  Judgement published:    as of this message

======================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

The POs that are defined and referred to in the rules are, by
definition, POs for positive multiples of a currency's MUQ (R1596).

Therefore, a "PO for 0 VTs" is an object not defined by the rules, and
so is the action of executing one.

Therefore the player who is required to "execute the PO" may choose what
that means with the freedom of R116, and can just ignore the
requirement.

In addition to this argument, there is also game custom to support this
statement: R1442 requires the Assessor to bill _all_ voting entities "a
number of Voting Tokens equal to the votes cast". This includes entities
who didn't vote at all, to be billed for 0 VTs. This requirement has
never been fulfilled in another way than just by being ignored.

======================================================================

Judge's Arguments:

I hereby enter a Judgement of TRUE. I would have phrased the conclusion
differently (as "the Rules cannot impose a requirement to execute a
Payment Order for 0 units of a Currency"), but I agree with the Caller's
reasoning.

======================================================================

Evidence attached by CotC:

Rule 1596/3 (Power=1)
Payment Orders

      A Payment Order is an Order requiring an entity (the payor) to
      submit a Transfer Order transferring units of a Currency from
      itself to some other entity (the payee).  A Payment Order
      specifies exactly one source entity, exactly one destination
      entity, exactly one Currency, and a number of units of that
      Currency which is a positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ.
