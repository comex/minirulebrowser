Proposal  (Chuck) AI = 5
CounterScam the Veto Scam, Part II

The Rule entitled "A Monument to the Threat" is hereby repealed.

If Proposal 3710 has been adopted, then a Rule, entitled "A Win for
Non-Threat" is hereby created, with the following text:

      All Players who did not win the game upon the creation of
      the Rule entitled "A Win for Threat" win the game upon creation
      of this Rule.  This takes precedence over Rules that would
      prevent any of them from winning the game at that time.

      Any Threat Trombones in existence are hereby destroyed.

      All Players who did not win the game upon the creation of
      the Rule entitled "A Win for Threat" are granted the Patent
      Title "Threat Trombone Mute".

      Chuck is granted the Patent Title "CounterScamster".

      This Rule shall repeal itself at 12:00 GMT on 15 April 1998.

[Comment: A Win for everyone might seem a little extreme, but
if everyone else doesn't get a reward at least that given
to certain people by the Veto Scam, why not just vote down
the Veto Scam?

I'd like to limit the win and PT to those voting FOR Part I,
but I'm afraid that would run afoul of R1003.]

Rule 955 is amended by appending a paragraph reading

      A Proposal may not have its Voting Index set except
      as described in this Rule.  A Proposal may not be adopted
      (synonymous with the Proposal passing) except as described
      in this Rule.

[Comment: Close this loophole.]

If Proposal 3710 has been adopted, then the Rule whose text
begins, "No instrument can create, or empower another entity to create,"
has its Power set to 3, and is amended to read as follows; if
Proposal 3710 has not been adopted, then a Rule is created with Power=3
and text as follows:

      Except as described in this Rule, no entity can set the Power
      of another entity to exceed the Power of the entity causing
      the Power to be so set.  A Rule may set the Power of an adopted
      Proposal, even exceeding the Power of the Rule, so long as the
      Power of the adopted Proposal does not exceed the Voting Index
      of that Proposal.

      No entity may destroy or repeal an entity with Power greater
      than its own.

[Comment: much shorter and more effective than Swann/Threat's
version.  Theirs has several problems.  First, does not
prevent an intrument from *changing* the Power of another.
Second, sets a Proposal's Power *before* it is adopted.
(Just look at what I did here with such a loophole!  Even
though TGOVSP seems to guard against that by not allowing
a Proposal to "take effect" until it's adopted, it's
still a dangerous precedent, IMO.)  R594 sets the Power of
a Proposal once it's adopted, anyway.  Also, their "Proposals
are explicitly exempt from this provision" is unclear--are
Proposals exempt as the creating entity, the created entity,
or both?  They have to throw in an extra prohibition on
Proposals later to make up for their ambiguity.  Finally, got
rid of the final paragraph, setting the default Power of
instruments to 1, as I'm not fond of having instruments
other than Proposals and Rules anyway, and I don't want to
encourage it.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Sherlock) AI = 1
Sherlock #1.3

Let a rule be created with the title "The Miscreant" and with the
following text:

      Let there exist the Patent Title of "Miscreant".

      If any Player has more than ten Blots, the Player with the most 
      Blots earns the Title of Miscreant.  If no Player has the most
      number of Blots, there is no Miscrean t.  The Miscreant loses
      eir Title of Miscreant if eir number of Blots drops below ten,
      if another Player gains as many Blots as em, or if another Player
      gains more Blots than em. 
 
      A Player with the Title Miscreant counts as two Players towards
      the tally needed for Rebellion.  If a Rebellion occurs in which 
      the Miscreant was a Rebel, the Title of Miscreant is revoked
      from the Miscreant.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Chuck) AI = 1
Repeal "Discourages Too Many Proposals"

Rule 1065 ("Discourages Too Many Proposals") is repealed.

[Comment: With the Proposal Queue, there's no benefit to
submitting lots of Proposals, and I think we can trust
people not to make unnecessary work for the Promotor.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Repeal-O-Matic) AI = 1
Repeal Rule 1663 (Win by Proposals)

Rule 1663 is hereby Repealed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Steve) AI = 1
Tweak R833

[Comment: the current version of R833 makes the timing of the POs
awkward for the Assessor, who may have to refer back to previous
Reports to determine which Proposals were adopted in the previous
week.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 833 have its Title changed to
"Reward for Getting a Proposal Passed" and that it be amended
to read:

      As soon as possible after an Interested Proposal submitted by a
      Player is adopted, the Assessor shall pay out two Voting Tokens
      to that Player, with the proviso that no more than one such
      payment shall be made to any Player under the authority of this
      Rule for adopted Proposals distributed at the same time.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Steve) AI = 3
Encourage VT spending

[Comment: the current Proposal/voting system allows VT expenditure
to drop to almost nothing as a response to VT scarcity: it only takes
1 VT to pass a Proposal, provided enough Players declare Presence.
I propose to block that avenue of escape from scarcity by raising
the minimum expenditure required to pass a Proposal to 3 VTs. I also
clarify the status of uncancelled votes with respect to R955.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 955 (Votes Required to Adopt a
Proposal) be amended to read:

      When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the
      uncancelled votes which have been legally cast shall be counted
      by the Assessor. The Proposal shall then be assigned a Voting
      Index, as follows: if the Proposal received no votes opposed,
      and at least one vote in favor, the Voting Index shall be
      Unanimity; if there are no votes in favor, the Voting Index
      shall be zero; in all other cases, the Voting Index shall be
      the number of votes in favor divided by the number of votes
      opposed.

      If the Voting Index is greater than the Adoption Index for the
      Proposal, or if both equal Unanimity, and there were at
      least three votes in favor of the Proposal, then that Proposal
      is adopted.  Otherwise, it fails.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Kolja A.) AI = 1
Reward for Trustees

Amend Rule 1757 (Implementation of Probate Plans) by appending to the
last paragraph the sentence 

      As soon as possible after an entity in Probate ceases to be 
      in Probate the Notary shall pay out three VTs to the last Trustee 
      of that entity.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Kolja A.) AI = 1
A Scoring nitpick

Amend 1784 by appending the paragraph

      When the Trustee of an entity in Probate resigns as Trustee e
      loses three points. The Notary must order this score change.

[Comment: Trustees perform a service to the Agora community, and they
should be rewarded for it (see "Rewards for Trustees). Scores measure
the degree of a player's activity in Agora, and they should reflect
refusals to serve the community.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Kolja A.) AI = 1
No Trustees on hold

Amend 1757 by replacing the string

"          or
        d) the Notary announces that e has been removed as Trustee."

with 

"       d) the Notary announces that e has been removed as Trustee;
           or
        e) e goes on hold."

[Comment: The probate procedure is slow enough as it is; this will
make the effect of going on hold for trustees similar to that for
officers. If someone goes on hold just to get rid of eir trusteeship
(and, possibly, other offices) and to avoid the score penalty for
resigning in my Proposal "A Scoring nitpick", well, so be
it. Delegating offices and other cleanup before going on hold will
probably be more work than simply finishing the trustee's job.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Kolja A.) AI = 1
Vacated blots and scores

Amend 1784 by replacing the paragraph reading

      Whenever a Player gains a Blot, e shall lose two Points.  The
      Herald must order this Score change.

with       

      Whenever a Player gains a Blot, e shall lose two Points.
      Whenever a Payment order for a certain number of indulgences 
      naming a player as payor is vacated, this player shall gain a 
      number of Points equal to twice the number of indulgences in 
      the PO. The Herald must order this Score change.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Kolja A.) AI = 1
Proposal 2: No PI for players on hold

Amend 1713 by replacing the second sentence with the following text:

      If the Executor of an entity for which, at the beginning of a 
      given Nomic week, there is at least one Overdue Payment Order 
      naming it as Payor is not on hold, e commits the Infraction of 
      Persistent Indebtedness at the beginning of that Week. If the
      Executor of such an entity comes off hold, e commits the 
      Infraction of Persistent Indebtedness.

Proposal 3723 (Sherlock) AI = 1
Sherlock #1.3

Let a rule be created with the title "The Miscreant" and with the
following text:

      Let there exist the Patent Title of "Miscreant".

      If any Player has more than ten Blots, the Player with the most 
      Blots earns the Title of Miscreant.  If no Player has the most
      number of Blots, there is no Miscrean t.  The Miscreant loses
      eir Title of Miscreant if eir number of Blots drops below ten,
      if another Player gains as many Blots as em, or if another Player
      gains more Blots than em. 
 
      A Player with the Title Miscreant counts as two Players towards
      the tally needed for Rebellion.  If a Rebellion occurs in which 
      the Miscreant was a Rebel, the Title of Miscreant is revoked
      from the Miscreant.

[Comment: With the Proposal Queue, there's no benefit to
submitting lots of Proposals, and I think we can trust
people not to make unnecessary work for the Promotor.]
