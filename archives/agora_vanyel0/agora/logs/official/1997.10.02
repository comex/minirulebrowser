======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

As Oerjan pointed out, there was an instant of time when Voting Tokens
also ceased to have a Mintor.
Decision of the Justiciar: TRUE (sustaining the original Judgement)

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Justiciar:

Judge Elde/Morendil argues that during implementation of the Proposal, a
rule change caused the Mint to cease being a mintor when it was the mintor
of VTs, before another rule change made the Bank the mintor of VTs.

There are several different interpretations on how the provisions of a
Proposal are implemented, which may affect the argument.  (For example, if
the provisions are implemented simultaneously, then the Mint did not cease
to be a mintor _before_ the Bank was mintor.)

But no matter which interpretation is chosen, it remains that the Mint
_did_ cease to have Mint Authority.  CFJ 828 (Destruction of Group Coins)
teaches that this is enough to satisfy the precise wording of Rule 1579,
even if it could be shown that VTs had a mintor at every legally
significant time.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Original Judge's argument

Proposal 3533, the Pragmatic Currencies proposal, was implemented under
authority of Rule 594.  Judge Elde argues that at the time Rule 1470 was
amended (depriving the Mint of Mint Authority),  Rule 1696 still named the
Mint as the Mintor for VTs. The conclusion is that Rule 1579 acted at that
moment to destroy all Voting Tokens.


2. How the provisions of a Proposal are implemented

There are several interpretations of the Rules on how the provisions of a
Proposal are implemented.

The Sequential View:   Each provision is implemented in order, if allowed
                       by the Rules then in effect, and the Game State is
                       adjusted to include consequent effects of this before
                       turning to the next provision.

The Atomic View:       Each provision is implemented in order, if allowed
                       by the Rules in effect at the adoption of the Proposal,
                       but no consequent effects cause an adjustment to the
                       Game State until all provisions have been dealt with.

The Simultaneous View: All the provisions are considered to be implemented
                       simultaneously,  if allowed by the Rules in effect
                       at the adoption of the Proposal, except where
                       dependencies among the provisions require that some
                       are implemented in sequence with other ones.

All three of these are consistent with the Rules, and the choice between
them must therefore rest on "game custom, commonsense, past Judgements, and
the best interests of the game."

The present decision does not require us to choose among these, and thus we
refrain from expressing an opinion as to which is preferred.


3.  Destruction of Game Coins, CFJ 828

It's fair to compare the present situation to the one arising in CFJ 828.
In that case, Proposal 1760 had revamped the Group rules but had forgotten
to provide that each Group was the mintor of its own Group Coins, or in
fact that Groups were permitted to be the mintors of anything.  However, a
Rule (1467) provided that "The Mintor of a Currency is the Mint if it is
not otherwise defined."

But the clear meaning of Rule 1471, worded very much like the two most
recent forms of Rule 1579, is that when one entity ceases to have authority
to mint a currency and another begins to have that authority in its stead,
then that currency is indeed destroyed.

The judgement in CFJ 828 states:
>Rule 1474/0 clearly said that the Mintor for a Group's Coins was the
>Group. That language was amended away by Proposal 1760, and the Group
>issuing the Coins then ceased to have authority to be a Mintor, that
>authority now going to the Mint.
>
>Rule 1471/0 states that
>
>   If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist, or ceases to have
>                                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
>   the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that Currency
>   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
>   are immediately destroyed, and Currency ceases to exist.
>
>
>Therefore the old Coins ceased to exist upon adoption of Proposal 1760.
[...]
>
>Even though a conclusion is inconvenient, the temptation of avoiding it
>by misinterpreting the Rules, or language, must be resisted.  The change
>of Mintor means that one entity ceased to have the authority and another
>one began having it.


Rule 1579/1 partly stated:
      If the designated Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist or ceases
      to possess Mint Authority, all units of that Currency are
      destroyed and the Currency ceases to exist.

Rule 1579/2 partly stated:
      If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist, or ceases to have
      the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that Currency
      are destroyed, and that Currency ceases to exist.


The inclusion of "designated" in Rule 1579/1 is not enough to change the
result.  The meaning of "mintor" and "designated mintor" have at all times
been the same, namely the mintor designated by the Rules.

Thus I rule that the statement was correctly judged TRUE.


Regards,
-- elJefe, Justiciar


=====================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

In CFJ 933, Elde Judges the Statement to be TRUE.

The reasons for thinking so are briefly outlined as follows :

* before 3533 passed, the Mint was a Nomic Entity
* the Mint was defined by Rule 1470
* 3533 amended 1470 so that it no longer defined the Mint
* by Rule 1586, the Mint ceased to exist
* at that time, the Mintor of VTs was still the Mint (1696)
* by Rule 1579, all VTs were therefore destroyed at that instant
* (thereafter, 1696 was amended to make the Bank the VT Mintor)

Rule 1579 stated :

      If the designated Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist or ceases
      to possess Mint Authority, all units of that Currency are
      destroyed and the Currency ceases to exist.

It has been suggested that Rule 1579 was at that time in conflict 
with Rule 1471, which stated

      The Mintor of a Currency may, at any time, destroy those units
      of that Currency which it currently possesses in its Treasury,
      so long as this destruction is permitted by the Rules.  Units of
      Currency may not be otherwise destroyed except as specifically
      authorized by the Rules.

separate support for this position being sought from this provision 
in Rule 1467 :

      Neither Currencies nor units of Currency shall be created or
      destroyed except as specified by the Rules.

It must be noted that Rule 1579's provisions both authorize, and
specify the manner of, the destruction of units of any Currency
falling under its purview; therefore, no conflict exists, precisely
because of both 1467's and 1471's conflict-avoiding provisions.

Appeals decisions

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Justice elJefe's decision: SUSTAIN

                              CFJ 930

"No Payment Orders have thus far been successfully executed, for the
 reason that none exist."

Judge Chuck relied on the reasoning of CFJ 929:

However, at the time of the CFJ, only one Transfer Order could have
been submitted, namely the Chancellor's transfer of 9 Indulgences
from the Bank to Elde. At that time the Mint (which was Mintor of
Indulgences) no longer had Mint Authority due to the effects of
Proposal 3533. Thus Indulgences ceased to exist as a Currency by
Rule 1579, and so the Chancellor's posting, not referring to any
Currency, was not a Transfer Order.

The only point in dispute is whether Indulgences continued to exist as
a currency after the adoption of Proposal 3533.  If they did then the
reasoning in the quoted paragraph of CFJ 929 is correct and the
judgement of TRUE stands.  If not then the judgement in both CFJs
should be FALSE, since the Misanthropists' currencies failed to
confuse itself with Payment Orders or Transfer Orders defined in the
Rules.

Quoting from Rule 1579: "If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist,
or ceases to have the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that
Currency are destroyed, and that Currency ceases to exist."  There is
unchallenged evidence that the old Mintor for Indulgences ceased to
exist, and that no new Mintor was designated.  Therefore unless this
conflicts with some higher-power Rule, it must be applied.

Rule 1435 begins "Indulgences are a Currency."  One possible
interpretation is that Indulgences were destroyed and ceased to exist
at a given instant; but then immediately after that R1435
re-established Indulgences as a Currency without a Mintor, which then
is immune to R1579 since it has no Mintor which can either cease
existing or lose Mint authority. (*)

This has several things wrong with it.  Rule 1435 is silent as to
whether Indulgences have a Mintor or not, so there is no conflict on
this point with R1579.  Thus any "re-establishment" of the currency
must follow the first sentence of R1579, which insists that each
Currency has a Mintor.

Further, the whole notion does not give sufficient respect to the
natural meaning of "cease to exist".  A rule mandating that something
ceases to exist does not mean for the thing to have its existence
interrupted temporarily and then re-appear.  If R1579 is strong enough
to destroy Indulgences (or P-notes) as a currency, then it is strong
enough to keep them destroyed.

This brings us to the central question: _is_ R1579 strong enough to do
what it says?  Well, does it conflict with R1435?  No.  R1435 simply
says that Indulgences are a Currency; R1579 says that they are in fact
a destroyed Currency. (**) This is similar to the repeal of a Rule;
longstanding Game Custom holds that a Rule or Proposal which repeals
another Rule is not for that sole reason in conflict with it. (***)
Thus 1579 did cause Indulgences to cease to exist, and they still
cease to exist to the present time.

NOTES:

(*) This possibility was raised during the discussion of the issues
surrounding a similar situation with regards to P-notes, so it is as
well to dispose of it here.

(**) My fellow learned Justice Michael objected that an earlier
version involves a "secret" insertion of "defunct" into the rule.
This wording is what I meant.

(***) My fellow learned Justice Michael also objected here, pointing
out that Rules and Rule changes occupy separate worlds.  But I feel
this misses the point of my analogy: a Rule Change (proposed or
unproposed) is effective only by virtue of Rules that allow it to take
effect.  Do those Rules (which affect the content of the Ruleset)
actually _conflict_ with the Rule being repealed?

This would be like having an implicit clause in each Rule that stated
"This rule may not be repealed"; game custom says it does not.
Similarly, Rule 1479 does not contain an implied "this currency may
not be destroyed" as part of its defining sentence.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Justice Michael's decision: OVERTURN/reverse

If Indulgences exist, then a Payment Order was executed by the
Chancellor when he attempted to transfer 9 Indulgences from the Bank
to Elde.

If Indulgences exist, then the Indulgence Currency's Recordkeepor is
authorised to record and execute Payment Orders (R1596).

Thus, if Indulgences exist, the correct judgement for this CFJ is
FALSE.

The argument that Indulgences do not exist is based on R1579, which
states that all Currencies have a Mintor and if a Currency should lose
its Mintor, then it is destroyed.  It is accepted that an entity known
as the Mint was the Mintor for Indulgences before the Pragmatic
Currencies reform occurred.

By virtue of R1586, we must also accept that the Mint no longer
exists, so it would appear that the antecedent of the conditional
sentence of the second paragraph in R1597 holds.  So, what might
prevent Indulgences from being destroyed, as required by R1579?

The answer is the precedence taking R1435.  This states that
"Indulgences are a Currency".  This statement must remain true,
whatever R1579 says to the contrary.  My Fellow Justice elJefe claims
that this is possible if one reads "Indulgences are a Currency" as
"Indulgences are a destroyed Currency".

This is a senseless contortion.  We do not need to put the rules
through such hoops.  We have rules taking precedence over each other
all the time.  When we read "Indulgences are a Currency", we know that
this is equivalent to stating that there exists a Currency whose name
is "Indulgences".  But now the opposing argument wants us to
simultaneously read this as admitting the precise opposite, that this
Currency doesn't exist at all.

I refuse to make the Rules play such tricks.  If a high precedence
rule says that Indulgences exist, then the lower precedence R1579 can
yammer on about Mintors and the lack thereof all it likes.

Indulgences exist.

                               CFJ 938

"Rule 1513 should be interpreted such that, if a body of text has been
 read by a Player, then it shall not lack the power to require that
 Player to perform or not perform an action solely because the Rules
 fail to require that it be made available to that Player."

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Rule 1513 ends with this text:

     Especially, no body of text is permitted to require Players to
     perform or not perform any actions unless said body of text has
     previously been made available to that Player.

This says "Text T can bind Player P only if P has read T"; it does not
say "Text T can bind Player P only if the Rules require that P can
receive a copy of T".

======================================================================

Decision and Reasoning Judge:

I Judge the Statement TRUE. Clearly any body of text that a Player has
read has been made available to that Player, under any definition of
what it means to be 'made available'. I don't necessarily accept the
suggestion made by the Caller that having been read by the Player is
a necessary condition for a text to have been made available to that
Player, but it certainly is sufficient.

Attention Rulekeepor! This CFJ contains an Injunction to annotate
a Rule!

======================================================================

                               CFJ 939

The provision in R1504 which states that:

      Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their
      legal report, and the Player making the report of the Infraction
      shall execute whatever Payment Order(s) are required to apply
      the penalty specified for that Infraction. 

should be interpreted such that penalties for Infractions are applied
immediately upon the legal report of the *penalties*, not the legal
report of the Infractions.

Judgement:   TRUE

Eligible:    Antimatter, Blob, Calabresi, ChrisM, Chuck, Elde, elJefe,

  Judged TRUE by Zefram, 16 Sep 1997 09:59:01 +0100

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

I reproduce as my argument the one I gave for the same conclusion
in my Judgement of CFJ 937:

"It's worth commenting at this point on an ambiguity in R1504: it's
not clear whether the report of the Infraction and the report of the
gain in Blots have to be made in the same message, or whether the
report of gain in Blots can follow the report of the Infraction by up
to seven days. The first sentence [sic] of R1504 states that
"Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their legal
report". But the legal report of what: the penalties or the
infractions? If infractions is meant, R1504 is somewhat in tension
with itself, since it immediately goes on to imply (along with other
Rules, eg R1599) that the application of the penalty can be later
than the report of the Infraction. So I read R1504 as saying that
penalties for Infractions are applied at the time the penalty is
reported, which can be later than the time the Infraction is reported."

Requested Injunction:

I request that the Judge of the CFJ issue an Injunction requesting
the Rulekeepor to annotate R1504 with the statement and the list
of relevant Rules below, as e is permitted to do by R789.

Relevant Rules: 1504, 1599

====================================================================

Judge's Reasoning:

The first clause of the provision in question says

      Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their
      legal report

As a native English speaker, I have no hesitation in interpreting the
word "their" in this context to refer to "Penalties for Infractions".
The alternative interpretation, with the antecedent being "Infractions",
is a less natural (though still valid) construct.  Given such an
ambiguity, the more natural interpretation of the language must be used.

======================================================================
                               CFJ 940

Rule 1596 should be interpreted so that a message purporting to
be a Payment Order must, in order to satisfy that Rule's requirements
and qualify as a legal Payment Order, explicitly and unambiguously
state that the purported Payor is ordered to effect a payment as
a consequence of that message, e.g. by stating "Player X is commanded
to pay Y", the mere mention of an amount of a Currency, the name or
names of the Payor and Payee, or a reference to some Rule or some
situation that requires a Payment Order to be executed being
insufficient for a message not containing such a command or entreaty
to qualify as a Payment Order.

  Judged TRUE by Chuck, 14 Sep 1997, 16:11 CDT

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

I believe this follows from Rule 1596's definition of a Payment Order
as "an order requiring an entity to" perform some action, and that no
message not framed as a command is a legal Payment Order.

Note that the claim that a particular message _is_ a Payment Order
is by that reasoning sufficient to satisfy Rule 1596's requirement.

I kindly request that the Judge of the CFJ enjoin the Rulekeepor to
annotate R1596 with the above statement and the list of relevant
Rules which follows : 1596.

======================================================================\

Decision and Reasoning Judge:

I judge this statement to be TRUE.

Injunction:
I hereby enjoin the Rulekeepor to annotate Rule 1596
with the statement and list of relevant Rules of this CFJ.

Reasons and Arguments:
I agree with the Caller's arguments.

                               CFJ 941

All proposed Amendments to the Frankenstein Rule were made impossible
by the Frankenstein Generator when the change to the Frankenstein
Monster assigned to "Week 1", reported by the Mad Scientist on Mon,
11 August 1997, took effect.

  Judged FALSE by Vlad, 16 Sep 1997 00:16 -0500 (CDT)

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

The Frankenstein Generator, 1672, requires among other things that 

      vii) All proposed Amendments to the Frankenstein Rule must
           consist of a single sentence of additional text specifying
           the properties and effects of a Frankenstein Monster, to be
           inserted between the first and last paragraphs.

However, the Frankenstein Monster, at the time specified in the
statement, contained the sentence

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Frankenstein Monster 
      is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing 
      the Frankenstein Monsters, which is permitted only when a 
      Frankenstein Monster or set of Frankenstein Monsters explicitly
      or implicitly permits it.

It did not, however, contain any explicit or implicit permissions
permitting such changes.

The introduction of additional text "specifying the properties and
effects of a Frankenstein Monster" is equivalent to "changing the
Frankenstein Monsters". So the FM prohibits the only proposed
amendments to the FR allowed by the FG.
(Note that amendments that change nothing are excluded by point

       vi) No Amendment can be applied to the Frankenstein Rule that
           is substantially the same as any prior successfully applied
           Amendment to the Frankenstein Rule.

of 1672)

Admittedly, this argument has two ossible weaknesses: The equivalence
stated in the preceding paragraph may be challenged. But I consider
this equivalence to hold - let the judge decide for emself.

And the FM also contains the sentence

      A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.

But I would say that, while the FM is permitted to define such
mechanisms, it doesn't actually do it, so this sentence establishes no
explicit or implicit permission to change the FM, after all.

======================================================================

Decision & Arguments Judge:

I find the Statement FALSE.

The Caller's arguments included the following:

It did not, however, contain any explicit or implicit permissions

------------------------

However, the Frankenstein Rule does contain the following clause:

A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.
---------------

"Any change to a Frankenstein Monster adopted in accordance with its
own mechanisms is legal." Now, in the absence of any clearly specified
mechanisms, is a given Amendment in accordance with them or not? Well,
your mileage may differ, but I consider this to be almost trivially true.
One cannot be in conflict with a non-existent law. Therefore, I declare
that (as of this time), the Frankenstein Monster gives implicit
permission to change itself.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

As Oerjan pointed out, there was an instant of time when Voting Tokens
also ceased to have a Mintor.

=====================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

In CFJ 933, Elde Judges the Statement to be TRUE.

The reasons for thinking so are briefly outlined as follows :

* before 3533 passed, the Mint was a Nomic Entity
* the Mint was defined by Rule 1470
* 3533 amended 1470 so that it no longer defined the Mint
* by Rule 1586, the Mint ceased to exist
* at that time, the Mintor of VTs was still the Mint (1696)
* by Rule 1579, all VTs were therefore destroyed at that instant
* (thereafter, 1696 was amended to make the Bank the VT Mintor)

Rule 1579 stated :

      If the designated Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist or ceases
      to possess Mint Authority, all units of that Currency are
      destroyed and the Currency ceases to exist.

It has been suggested that Rule 1579 was at that time in conflict 
with Rule 1471, which stated

      The Mintor of a Currency may, at any time, destroy those units
      of that Currency which it currently possesses in its Treasury,
      so long as this destruction is permitted by the Rules.  Units of
      Currency may not be otherwise destroyed except as specifically
      authorized by the Rules.

separate support for this position being sought from this provision 
in Rule 1467 :

      Neither Currencies nor units of Currency shall be created or
      destroyed except as specified by the Rules.

It must be noted that Rule 1579's provisions both authorize, and
specify the manner of, the destruction of units of any Currency
falling under its purview; therefore, no conflict exists, precisely
because of both 1467's and 1471's conflict-avoiding provisions.

Appeals decisions

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Justice elJefe's decision: SUSTAIN

>                               CFJ 930

> "No Payment Orders have thus far been successfully executed, for the
>  reason that none exist."

Judge Chuck relied on the reasoning of CFJ 929:

> However, at the time of the CFJ, only one Transfer Order could have
> been submitted, namely the Chancellor's transfer of 9 Indulgences
> from the Bank to Elde. At that time the Mint (which was Mintor of
> Indulgences) no longer had Mint Authority due to the effects of
> Proposal 3533. Thus Indulgences ceased to exist as a Currency by
> Rule 1579, and so the Chancellor's posting, not referring to any
> Currency, was not a Transfer Order.

The only point in dispute is whether Indulgences continued to exist as
a currency after the adoption of Proposal 3533.  If they did then the
reasoning in the quoted paragraph of CFJ 929 is correct and the
judgement of TRUE stands.  If not then the judgement in both CFJs
should be FALSE, since the Misanthropists' currencies failed to
confuse itself with Payment Orders or Transfer Orders defined in the
Rules.

Quoting from Rule 1579: "If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist,
or ceases to have the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that
Currency are destroyed, and that Currency ceases to exist."  There is
unchallenged evidence that the old Mintor for Indulgences ceased to
exist, and that no new Mintor was designated.  Therefore unless this
conflicts with some higher-power Rule, it must be applied.

Rule 1435 begins "Indulgences are a Currency."  One possible
interpretation is that Indulgences were destroyed and ceased to exist
at a given instant; but then immediately after that R1435
re-established Indulgences as a Currency without a Mintor, which then
is immune to R1579 since it has no Mintor which can either cease
existing or lose Mint authority. (*)

This has several things wrong with it.  Rule 1435 is silent as to
whether Indulgences have a Mintor or not, so there is no conflict on
this point with R1579.  Thus any "re-establishment" of the currency
must follow the first sentence of R1579, which insists that each
Currency has a Mintor.

Further, the whole notion does not give sufficient respect to the
natural meaning of "cease to exist".  A rule mandating that something
ceases to exist does not mean for the thing to have its existence
interrupted temporarily and then re-appear.  If R1579 is strong enough
to destroy Indulgences (or P-notes) as a currency, then it is strong
enough to keep them destroyed.

This brings us to the central question: _is_ R1579 strong enough to do
what it says?  Well, does it conflict with R1435?  No.  R1435 simply
says that Indulgences are a Currency; R1579 says that they are in fact
a destroyed Currency. (**) This is similar to the repeal of a Rule;
longstanding Game Custom holds that a Rule or Proposal which repeals
another Rule is not for that sole reason in conflict with it. (***)
Thus 1579 did cause Indulgences to cease to exist, and they still
cease to exist to the present time.

NOTES:

(*) This possibility was raised during the discussion of the issues
surrounding a similar situation with regards to P-notes, so it is as
well to dispose of it here.

(**) My fellow learned Justice Michael objected that an earlier
version involves a "secret" insertion of "defunct" into the rule.
This wording is what I meant.

(***) My fellow learned Justice Michael also objected here, pointing
out that Rules and Rule changes occupy separate worlds.  But I feel
this misses the point of my analogy: a Rule Change (proposed or
unproposed) is effective only by virtue of Rules that allow it to take
effect.  Do those Rules (which affect the content of the Ruleset)
actually _conflict_ with the Rule being repealed?

This would be like having an implicit clause in each Rule that stated
"This rule may not be repealed"; game custom says it does not.
Similarly, Rule 1479 does not contain an implied "this currency may
not be destroyed" as part of its defining sentence.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Justice Michael's decision: OVERTURN/reverse

If Indulgences exist, then a Payment Order was executed by the
Chancellor when he attempted to transfer 9 Indulgences from the Bank
to Elde.

If Indulgences exist, then the Indulgence Currency's Recordkeepor is
authorised to record and execute Payment Orders (R1596).

Thus, if Indulgences exist, the correct judgement for this CFJ is
FALSE.

The argument that Indulgences do not exist is based on R1579, which
states that all Currencies have a Mintor and if a Currency should lose
its Mintor, then it is destroyed.  It is accepted that an entity known
as the Mint was the Mintor for Indulgences before the Pragmatic
Currencies reform occurred.

By virtue of R1586, we must also accept that the Mint no longer
exists, so it would appear that the antecedent of the conditional
sentence of the second paragraph in R1597 holds.  So, what might
prevent Indulgences from being destroyed, as required by R1579?

The answer is the precedence taking R1435.  This states that
"Indulgences are a Currency".  This statement must remain true,
whatever R1579 says to the contrary.  My Fellow Justice elJefe claims
that this is possible if one reads "Indulgences are a Currency" as
"Indulgences are a destroyed Currency".

This is a senseless contortion.  We do not need to put the rules
through such hoops.  We have rules taking precedence over each other
all the time.  When we read "Indulgences are a Currency", we know that
this is equivalent to stating that there exists a Currency whose name
is "Indulgences".  But now the opposing argument wants us to
simultaneously read this as admitting the precise opposite, that this
Currency doesn't exist at all.

I refuse to make the Rules play such tricks.  If a high precedence
rule says that Indulgences exist, then the lower precedence R1579 can
yammer on about Mintors and the lack thereof all it likes.

Indulgences exist.

======================================================================

Original Judgement: TRUE

Reasons and arguments:

Judge elJefe's reasoning on CFJ 929 applies here as well.

                               CFJ 940

Rule 1596 should be interpreted so that a message purporting to
be a Payment Order must, in order to satisfy that Rule's requirements
and qualify as a legal Payment Order, explicitly and unambiguously
state that the purported Payor is ordered to effect a payment as
a consequence of that message, e.g. by stating "Player X is commanded
to pay Y", the mere mention of an amount of a Currency, the name or
names of the Payor and Payee, or a reference to some Rule or some
situation that requires a Payment Order to be executed being
insufficient for a message not containing such a command or entreaty
to qualify as a Payment Order.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

I believe this follows from Rule 1596's definition of a Payment Order
as "an order requiring an entity to" perform some action, and that no
message not framed as a command is a legal Payment Order.

Note that the claim that a particular message _is_ a Payment Order
is by that reasoning sufficient to satisfy Rule 1596's requirement.

I kindly request that the Judge of the CFJ enjoin the Rulekeepor to
annotate R1596 with the above statement and the list of relevant
Rules which follows : 1596.

======================================================================\

Decision and Reasoning Judge:

I judge this statement to be TRUE.

Injunction:
I hereby enjoin the Rulekeepor to annotate Rule 1596
with the statement and list of relevant Rules of this CFJ.

Reasons and Arguments:
I agree with the Caller's arguments.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments (slighted edited):

See my argument above concerning retroactive rule effects.  Another
example may help (which is why I worded the CFJ as I did).  The disinfection of
R693 can be seen as assigning an historical significance to the ten days
following the distribution of each of these proposals.  It is like passing a
rule now which says, "September 1, 1997 through September 7, 1997 shall be
known as 'The Week of the Cumberbuns'".  This would retroactively give a
significance to those days, an effect which, I contend, is not prohibited by
R108.

'my argument above' is pointing to the following text (this line is
an insertion by the CotC):

I appeal the judgement on CFJ 933.

>From the judgement:
>>
* at that time, the Mintor of VTs was still the Mint (1696)
* by Rule 1579, all VTs were therefore destroyed at that instant
                                                         ^^^^^^^
* (thereafter, 1696 was amended to make the Bank the VT Mintor)
<<

As I explained in an earlier post, I think no such "instant" ever
--erm, what do instants do? exist? happen? well, never mind... --
anyway, there never was such an instant. That's why 1527 speaks of
infinitesimal time separations, not simply of small ones.

So the bank became mintor in time to save VTs, and so on and so on.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

As Oerjan pointed out, there was an instant of time when Voting Tokens
also ceased to have a Mintor.

=====================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

In CFJ 933, Elde Judges the Statement to be TRUE.

The reasons for thinking so are briefly outlined as follows :

* before 3533 passed, the Mint was a Nomic Entity
* the Mint was defined by Rule 1470
* 3533 amended 1470 so that it no longer defined the Mint
* by Rule 1586, the Mint ceased to exist
* at that time, the Mintor of VTs was still the Mint (1696)
* by Rule 1579, all VTs were therefore destroyed at that instant
* (thereafter, 1696 was amended to make the Bank the VT Mintor)

Rule 1579 stated :

      If the designated Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist or ceases
      to possess Mint Authority, all units of that Currency are
      destroyed and the Currency ceases to exist.

It has been suggested that Rule 1579 was at that time in conflict 
with Rule 1471, which stated

      The Mintor of a Currency may, at any time, destroy those units
      of that Currency which it currently possesses in its Treasury,
      so long as this destruction is permitted by the Rules.  Units of
      Currency may not be otherwise destroyed except as specifically
      authorized by the Rules.

separate support for this position being sought from this provision 
in Rule 1467 :

      Neither Currencies nor units of Currency shall be created or
      destroyed except as specified by the Rules.

It must be noted that Rule 1579's provisions both authorize, and
specify the manner of, the destruction of units of any Currency
falling under its purview; therefore, no conflict exists, precisely
because of both 1467's and 1471's conflict-avoiding provisions.

I find Kolja's analysis of 1527/376 interesting, and at the very least
it deserves closer examination.  I therefore call for the appeal of
CFJ 933.

Decision of the Justiciar: SUSTAIN the judgement of FALSE

For trivial reasons.  The date in the statement is wrong for the caller's
argument to work, and there is no other reason for thinking the statement
true.

This is a factual error, not a spelling (etc.) error, nor the use of a
synonym or abbreviation, so I can't use Rule 754 to Judge the statement
that was probably intended.

The caller states:

>However, the Frankenstein Monster, at the time specified in the
>statement, contained the sentence
>
>      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Frankenstein Monster
>      is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing
>      the Frankenstein Monsters, which is permitted only when a
>      Frankenstein Monster or set of Frankenstein Monsters explicitly
>      or implicitly permits it.

This sentence was reported on 6 September 1997, _not_ at the time specified
in the Statement.

The only sentence addition reported on Mon, 11 August 1997, was:

      A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.


There is no reason to think that this addition made changes impossible.

                               CFJ 938

"Rule 1513 should be interpreted such that, if a body of text has been
 read by a Player, then it shall not lack the power to require that
 Player to perform or not perform an action solely because the Rules
 fail to require that it be made available to that Player."

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Rule 1513 ends with this text:

     Especially, no body of text is permitted to require Players to
     perform or not perform any actions unless said body of text has
     previously been made available to that Player.

This says "Text T can bind Player P only if P has read T"; it does not
say "Text T can bind Player P only if the Rules require that P can
receive a copy of T".

======================================================================

Decision and Reasoning Judge:

I Judge the Statement TRUE. Clearly any body of text that a Player has
read has been made available to that Player, under any definition of
what it means to be 'made available'. I don't necessarily accept the
suggestion made by the Caller that having been read by the Player is
a necessary condition for a text to have been made available to that
Player, but it certainly is sufficient.

Attention Rulekeepor! This CFJ contains an Injunction to annotate
a Rule!

======================================================================

                               CFJ 939

The provision in R1504 which states that:

      Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their
      legal report, and the Player making the report of the Infraction
      shall execute whatever Payment Order(s) are required to apply
      the penalty specified for that Infraction. 

should be interpreted such that penalties for Infractions are applied
immediately upon the legal report of the *penalties*, not the legal
report of the Infractions.

Judgement:   TRUE

Eligible:    Antimatter, Blob, Calabresi, ChrisM, Chuck, Elde, elJefe,

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

I reproduce as my argument the one I gave for the same conclusion
in my Judgement of CFJ 937:

"It's worth commenting at this point on an ambiguity in R1504: it's
not clear whether the report of the Infraction and the report of the
gain in Blots have to be made in the same message, or whether the
report of gain in Blots can follow the report of the Infraction by up
to seven days. The first sentence [sic] of R1504 states that
"Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their legal
report". But the legal report of what: the penalties or the
infractions? If infractions is meant, R1504 is somewhat in tension
with itself, since it immediately goes on to imply (along with other
Rules, eg R1599) that the application of the penalty can be later
than the report of the Infraction. So I read R1504 as saying that
penalties for Infractions are applied at the time the penalty is
reported, which can be later than the time the Infraction is reported."

Requested Injunction:

I request that the Judge of the CFJ issue an Injunction requesting
the Rulekeepor to annotate R1504 with the statement and the list
of relevant Rules below, as e is permitted to do by R789.

Relevant Rules: 1504, 1599

====================================================================

Judge's Reasoning:

The first clause of the provision in question says

      Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their
      legal report

As a native English speaker, I have no hesitation in interpreting the
word "their" in this context to refer to "Penalties for Infractions".
The alternative interpretation, with the antecedent being "Infractions",
is a less natural (though still valid) construct.  Given such an
ambiguity, the more natural interpretation of the language must be used.

======================================================================
                               CFJ 940

Rule 1596 should be interpreted so that a message purporting to
be a Payment Order must, in order to satisfy that Rule's requirements
and qualify as a legal Payment Order, explicitly and unambiguously
state that the purported Payor is ordered to effect a payment as
a consequence of that message, e.g. by stating "Player X is commanded
to pay Y", the mere mention of an amount of a Currency, the name or
names of the Payor and Payee, or a reference to some Rule or some
situation that requires a Payment Order to be executed being
insufficient for a message not containing such a command or entreaty
to qualify as a Payment Order.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

I believe this follows from Rule 1596's definition of a Payment Order
as "an order requiring an entity to" perform some action, and that no
message not framed as a command is a legal Payment Order.

Note that the claim that a particular message _is_ a Payment Order
is by that reasoning sufficient to satisfy Rule 1596's requirement.

I kindly request that the Judge of the CFJ enjoin the Rulekeepor to
annotate R1596 with the above statement and the list of relevant
Rules which follows : 1596.

Decision and Reasoning Judge:

I judge this statement to be TRUE.

Injunction:
I hereby enjoin the Rulekeepor to annotate Rule 1596

I agree with the Caller's arguments.

                               CFJ 941

All proposed Amendments to the Frankenstein Rule were made impossible
by the Frankenstein Generator when the change to the Frankenstein
Monster assigned to "Week 1", reported by the Mad Scientist on Mon,
11 August 1997, took effect.

  Judged FALSE by Vlad, 16 Sep 1997 00:16 -0500 (CDT)

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

The Frankenstein Generator, 1672, requires among other things that 

      vii) All proposed Amendments to the Frankenstein Rule must
           consist of a single sentence of additional text specifying
           the properties and effects of a Frankenstein Monster, to be
           inserted between the first and last paragraphs.

However, the Frankenstein Monster, at the time specified in the
statement, contained the sentence

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Frankenstein Monster 
      is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing 
      the Frankenstein Monsters, which is permitted only when a 
      Frankenstein Monster or set of Frankenstein Monsters explicitly
      or implicitly permits it.

It did not, however, contain any explicit or implicit permissions
permitting such changes.

The introduction of additional text "specifying the properties and
effects of a Frankenstein Monster" is equivalent to "changing the
Frankenstein Monsters". So the FM prohibits the only proposed
amendments to the FR allowed by the FG.
(Note that amendments that change nothing are excluded by point

       vi) No Amendment can be applied to the Frankenstein Rule that
           is substantially the same as any prior successfully applied
           Amendment to the Frankenstein Rule.

of 1672)

Admittedly, this argument has two ossible weaknesses: The equivalence
stated in the preceding paragraph may be challenged. But I consider
this equivalence to hold - let the judge decide for emself.

And the FM also contains the sentence

      A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.

But I would say that, while the FM is permitted to define such
mechanisms, it doesn't actually do it, so this sentence establishes no
explicit or implicit permission to change the FM, after all.

======================================================================

Decision & Arguments Judge:

I find the Statement FALSE.

The Caller's arguments included the following:

It did not, however, contain any explicit or implicit permissions

------------------------

However, the Frankenstein Rule does contain the following clause:

A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.
---------------

"Any change to a Frankenstein Monster adopted in accordance with its
own mechanisms is legal." Now, in the absence of any clearly specified
mechanisms, is a given Amendment in accordance with them or not? Well,
your mileage may differ, but I consider this to be almost trivially true.
One cannot be in conflict with a non-existent law. Therefore, I declare
that (as of this time), the Frankenstein Monster gives implicit
permission to change itself.

not in fact a CFJ, and that therefore neither the Clerk of the Courts

======================================================================

Relevant Rules: 789, 991

======================================================================
(Caller's) Arguments:
I don't really have particularly strong feelings about this one way
or the other, but it seems we need a decision, and this will set a
precedent we can use in future cases, should any such arise. I have
a mild tendency to think that the Statement is TRUE, for reasons which
I outline below.

There are reasonable arguments on both sides, which the Judge must
choose between. These turn on how the word 'must' in R789 should be
interpreted:

      A CFJ alleging a Rule should be interpreted in a certain way
      must be accompanied by a list of relevant Rules, assembled by
      the Caller, which includes the Rule being interpreted.

On the one hand, we could interpret this 'must' as imposing an obligation
on a Caller to include a list of Relevant Rules, an obligation which, if
the Caller fails to meet it, results in the Caller having violated R789.
On this reading, there is no reason to think that the legality of the CFJ
is brought into question by the Caller's having violated R789, and so the
Statement would be FALSE.

On the other hand, we could interpret this 'must' as imposing a condition
on what it takes to be a CFJ. On this reading, it is partially definitive
of being a CFJ (of the relevant kind) that it be accompanied by a list
of Relevant Rules. This would bring R789 into conflict with R991, which
offers an incompatible definition:

      Any document submitted to the Clerk of the Courts and which is
      clearly marked as a Call for Judgement is a Call for Judgement.

Since R789 wins this conflict by virtue of its lower Number, we arrive
at the conclusion that the Statement is TRUE.

Two possible interpretations, both plausible. Is there any reason to
favour one over the other? I think there is such a reason: the
precise wording of R789, which states that "A CFJ...must...", and not
"The Caller of a CFJ...must...". I think this gives us a reason to
regard to R789 more plausibly as imposing a condition on what it
takes to be a CFJ than as imposing a requirement on the Caller. It
may not be a terribly powerful reason for preferring the second
interpretation to the first, but in the absence of other compelling
reasons to make one judgement rather than the other, it may prove
decisive. At any rate, I offer it to the Judge for eir consideration.

Requested Injunction:

I request that the Judge issue an Injunction requiring the Rulekeepor
to annotate R789 with the Statement, as e is permitted to do by R789.
[Maybe at last I'll get my self-referential annotation of R789!]

======================================================================

Decision and Reasoning Judge:

My judgement on CFJ 942:

FALSE.

But for a reason no one seems to have noticed. I was, at first, quite 
inclined to agree with the Caller. In fact, I felt less equivocal about 
it than he did. It seemed to me that, in the absence of clear wording 
specifying that, without a list of Relevant Rules, the *Caller* had made 
an error or committed a crime, the correct interpretation would be that 
the CFJ was simply invalid without said list. The minimum requirement for 
that list would simply be a notation that the rule in question was itself 
relevant to the CFJ; after all, "a list of relevant rules" does not imply 
a *complete* list. And as anyone with LISP or set theory experience 
knows, a list with only one item is still a list.

But then I came to the part in the Caller's argument related to Rule 991. 
He noted that, under my interpretation of Rule 789, the two rules were in 
conflict. He then stated that, because of rule 789's lower number, it 
takes precedence. And that would be well and true except that Rule 991 
has a Power of 2, while Rule 789 has a Power of 1. Under Rule 1482 
(Power=3), Rule 991 thus takes precedence, and we are in a situation where

      Any document submitted to the Clerk of the Courts and which is
      clearly marked as a Call for Judgement is a Call for Judgement.
      (991/3)

Therefore the statement is FALSE.

Caller's Other Remarks:

Orders.]

======================================================================

Decision and Reasoning Judge

Judgement: FALSE

Reasons:

The major problem in this situation is that the concept of payment 
orders, blots, and penalties are incredibly poorly defined in relation to 
each other.

First of all, we have R1435, which tells us that a P.O. for 1 Indulgence 
with a payee as the Bank is called a Blot. It then tells us that when a 
Rule states that a Player is to gain some number of Blots, a P.O. shall 
be executed with that Player as the payor, the Bank as the payee, and for 
a # of indulgences equal to the # of Blots the Player is to receive.

Thus, we have now implicitly recognized the concept of "gaining" a 
payment order, since a PO for 1 Ind. to the Bank = a Blot. This is 
incredibly unclear wording. So once the Blotee has "gained" a payment 
order, someone else is required to "execute" a payment order. Are these 
P.O.'s the same? It's quite unclear. But, and the next paragraph of the 
rule gives some support for this, I'm going to assume that this is just 
poor phrasing.

So now someone is required to 'execute' the payment order. In this case, 
it was the CotC, under R408. A P.O. is "executed" by posting it to the 
Public Forum. So again, we have a point of confusion. Is a P.O. a 
message, or a string of text? Those things can be posted to the Public 
Forum. On the other hand, if that were the case, then any message in the 
correct form would be a P.O., and if it were specifically in the correct 
form under R1435, it would be a Blot. This is still a Blot, regardless of 
whether it has been 'executed.' So then, for example, I have a # of Blots 
= to the # of messages in that form that I have? Well, have where? In my 
mailbox? In some platonic mailbox? But then again, R1435 says a Player 
'may be said' to have a # of Blots = to something else entirely. Thus, a 
contradiction. Now, I'm not saying that this interpretation of a Blot as 
a message is correct, merely that is is highly unclear and ambiguous in 
the Rules.

R1596 never says that the *only* way a P.O. can be executed is for a 
player with the authority to post it to the Public Forum. Thus, except 
for one small point, I would be inclined to judge that R408, by assigning 
a penalty of 3 Blots to a crime, implicitly executes a P.O. for that 
amount. The problem, though (among many others I'm sure will be brought 
up over that point), is that a Blot "is to be executed by whomever is 
required to report the change in Blots." Thus, the CotC. So, as amazingly 
unclear as the situation is, it does appear that the CotC was required to 
'execute' the Blot/P.O.'s by 'post[ing] the Order to the Public Forum.'

So did he? *Yes.*

Why do I have a feeling this is going to be appealed? Anyway, here's why.

Here's what the CotC said: "Blob commits the Infraction of Failing to 
Judge, an action which bears the penalty of 3 Blots."

A Blot has been defined in the rules. Thus, this sentence is equivalent 
to:

Blob commits...an action which bears the penalty of 3 Payment Orders for 
1 Indulgence, the payees of which are the Bank. In my opinion, this 
"specifies exactly one source entity, exactly one destination entity, 
exactly one Currency, and a number of units of that Currency which is a 
positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ." 

The syntax and meaning of a 'penalty' makes it clear that Blob is the 
source entity, and the rest is clear.

The message concerning Elde was phrased identically. elJefe's was phrased 
differently:

"elJefe receives 3 Blots committing the Infraction of Failing to Judge."

So elJefe receives 3 P.O.'s? This syntax would seem to indicate that 
elJefe is the pay*ee* of this transaction! But the Bank is already 
defined as the payee, by the definition of a Blot. So this does *not* 
specify exactly one source entity and one destination entity. Thus, the 
CotC *did* fail to execute the required P.O. for the 3rd infraction. 
However, as the statement of the CFJ alleges that the CotC failed in all 
*3* cases, it must be judged FALSE.

A possible objection would be that R1435 specifies what it means to 'gain 
some # of Blots.' That is quite true -- it means that a P.O. shall be 
executed. But the P.O. was *not* executed, as R1435 does not mention 
anything about *messages* stating that players gain Blots, only about 
*Rules* which so state.

So my judgement is FALSE, CFJ 940 be damned. I have "considered game 
custom, commonsense, past Judgements, and the best interests of the game 
before applying other standards." I personally think CFJ 940 was judged 
incorrectly; however, that is irrelevant here. I'm under no obligation to 
abide by past incorrect judgements. :) What a welcome back to Agora!

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

As Oerjan pointed out, there was an instant of time when Voting Tokens
also ceased to have a Mintor.

=====================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

In CFJ 933, Elde Judges the Statement to be TRUE.

The reasons for thinking so are briefly outlined as follows :

* before 3533 passed, the Mint was a Nomic Entity
* the Mint was defined by Rule 1470
* 3533 amended 1470 so that it no longer defined the Mint
* by Rule 1586, the Mint ceased to exist
* at that time, the Mintor of VTs was still the Mint (1696)
* by Rule 1579, all VTs were therefore destroyed at that instant
* (thereafter, 1696 was amended to make the Bank the VT Mintor)

Rule 1579 stated :

      If the designated Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist or ceases
      to possess Mint Authority, all units of that Currency are
      destroyed and the Currency ceases to exist.

It has been suggested that Rule 1579 was at that time in conflict 
with Rule 1471, which stated

      The Mintor of a Currency may, at any time, destroy those units
      of that Currency which it currently possesses in its Treasury,
      so long as this destruction is permitted by the Rules.  Units of
      Currency may not be otherwise destroyed except as specifically
      authorized by the Rules.

separate support for this position being sought from this provision 
in Rule 1467 :

      Neither Currencies nor units of Currency shall be created or
      destroyed except as specified by the Rules.

It must be noted that Rule 1579's provisions both authorize, and
specify the manner of, the destruction of units of any Currency
falling under its purview; therefore, no conflict exists, precisely
because of both 1467's and 1471's conflict-avoiding provisions.

Appeals decisions

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Justice elJefe's decision: SUSTAIN

                              CFJ 930

"No Payment Orders have thus far been successfully executed, for the
 reason that none exist."

Judge Chuck relied on the reasoning of CFJ 929:

However, at the time of the CFJ, only one Transfer Order could have
been submitted, namely the Chancellor's transfer of 9 Indulgences
from the Bank to Elde. At that time the Mint (which was Mintor of
Indulgences) no longer had Mint Authority due to the effects of
Proposal 3533. Thus Indulgences ceased to exist as a Currency by
Rule 1579, and so the Chancellor's posting, not referring to any
Currency, was not a Transfer Order.

The only point in dispute is whether Indulgences continued to exist as
a currency after the adoption of Proposal 3533.  If they did then the
reasoning in the quoted paragraph of CFJ 929 is correct and the
judgement of TRUE stands.  If not then the judgement in both CFJs
should be FALSE, since the Misanthropists' currencies failed to
confuse itself with Payment Orders or Transfer Orders defined in the
Rules.

Quoting from Rule 1579: "If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist,
or ceases to have the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that
Currency are destroyed, and that Currency ceases to exist."  There is
unchallenged evidence that the old Mintor for Indulgences ceased to
exist, and that no new Mintor was designated.  Therefore unless this
conflicts with some higher-power Rule, it must be applied.

Rule 1435 begins "Indulgences are a Currency."  One possible
interpretation is that Indulgences were destroyed and ceased to exist
at a given instant; but then immediately after that R1435
re-established Indulgences as a Currency without a Mintor, which then
is immune to R1579 since it has no Mintor which can either cease
existing or lose Mint authority. (*)

This has several things wrong with it.  Rule 1435 is silent as to
whether Indulgences have a Mintor or not, so there is no conflict on
this point with R1579.  Thus any "re-establishment" of the currency
must follow the first sentence of R1579, which insists that each
Currency has a Mintor.

Further, the whole notion does not give sufficient respect to the
natural meaning of "cease to exist".  A rule mandating that something
ceases to exist does not mean for the thing to have its existence
interrupted temporarily and then re-appear.  If R1579 is strong enough
to destroy Indulgences (or P-notes) as a currency, then it is strong
enough to keep them destroyed.

This brings us to the central question: _is_ R1579 strong enough to do
what it says?  Well, does it conflict with R1435?  No.  R1435 simply
says that Indulgences are a Currency; R1579 says that they are in fact
a destroyed Currency. (**) This is similar to the repeal of a Rule;
longstanding Game Custom holds that a Rule or Proposal which repeals
another Rule is not for that sole reason in conflict with it. (***)
Thus 1579 did cause Indulgences to cease to exist, and they still
cease to exist to the present time.

NOTES:

(*) This possibility was raised during the discussion of the issues
surrounding a similar situation with regards to P-notes, so it is as
well to dispose of it here.

(**) My fellow learned Justice Michael objected that an earlier
version involves a "secret" insertion of "defunct" into the rule.
This wording is what I meant.

(***) My fellow learned Justice Michael also objected here, pointing
out that Rules and Rule changes occupy separate worlds.  But I feel
this misses the point of my analogy: a Rule Change (proposed or
unproposed) is effective only by virtue of Rules that allow it to take
effect.  Do those Rules (which affect the content of the Ruleset)
actually _conflict_ with the Rule being repealed?

This would be like having an implicit clause in each Rule that stated
"This rule may not be repealed"; game custom says it does not.
Similarly, Rule 1479 does not contain an implied "this currency may
not be destroyed" as part of its defining sentence.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Justice Michael's decision: OVERTURN/reverse

If Indulgences exist, then a Payment Order was executed by the
Chancellor when he attempted to transfer 9 Indulgences from the Bank
to Elde.

If Indulgences exist, then the Indulgence Currency's Recordkeepor is
authorised to record and execute Payment Orders (R1596).

Thus, if Indulgences exist, the correct judgement for this CFJ is
FALSE.

The argument that Indulgences do not exist is based on R1579, which
states that all Currencies have a Mintor and if a Currency should lose
its Mintor, then it is destroyed.  It is accepted that an entity known
as the Mint was the Mintor for Indulgences before the Pragmatic
Currencies reform occurred.

By virtue of R1586, we must also accept that the Mint no longer
exists, so it would appear that the antecedent of the conditional
sentence of the second paragraph in R1597 holds.  So, what might
prevent Indulgences from being destroyed, as required by R1579?

The answer is the precedence taking R1435.  This states that
"Indulgences are a Currency".  This statement must remain true,
whatever R1579 says to the contrary.  My Fellow Justice elJefe claims
that this is possible if one reads "Indulgences are a Currency" as
"Indulgences are a destroyed Currency".

This is a senseless contortion.  We do not need to put the rules
through such hoops.  We have rules taking precedence over each other
all the time.  When we read "Indulgences are a Currency", we know that
this is equivalent to stating that there exists a Currency whose name
is "Indulgences".  But now the opposing argument wants us to
simultaneously read this as admitting the precise opposite, that this
Currency doesn't exist at all.

I refuse to make the Rules play such tricks.  If a high precedence
rule says that Indulgences exist, then the lower precedence R1579 can
yammer on about Mintors and the lack thereof all it likes.

Indulgences exist.

Appeals decisions

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Justice elJefe's decision: SUSTAIN

>                               CFJ 930

> "No Payment Orders have thus far been successfully executed, for the
>  reason that none exist."

Judge Chuck relied on the reasoning of CFJ 929:

> However, at the time of the CFJ, only one Transfer Order could have
> been submitted, namely the Chancellor's transfer of 9 Indulgences
> from the Bank to Elde. At that time the Mint (which was Mintor of
> Indulgences) no longer had Mint Authority due to the effects of
> Proposal 3533. Thus Indulgences ceased to exist as a Currency by
> Rule 1579, and so the Chancellor's posting, not referring to any
> Currency, was not a Transfer Order.

The only point in dispute is whether Indulgences continued to exist as
a currency after the adoption of Proposal 3533.  If they did then the
reasoning in the quoted paragraph of CFJ 929 is correct and the
judgement of TRUE stands.  If not then the judgement in both CFJs
should be FALSE, since the Misanthropists' currencies failed to
confuse itself with Payment Orders or Transfer Orders defined in the
Rules.

Quoting from Rule 1579: "If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist,
or ceases to have the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that
Currency are destroyed, and that Currency ceases to exist."  There is
unchallenged evidence that the old Mintor for Indulgences ceased to
exist, and that no new Mintor was designated.  Therefore unless this
conflicts with some higher-power Rule, it must be applied.

Rule 1435 begins "Indulgences are a Currency."  One possible
interpretation is that Indulgences were destroyed and ceased to exist
at a given instant; but then immediately after that R1435
re-established Indulgences as a Currency without a Mintor, which then
is immune to R1579 since it has no Mintor which can either cease
existing or lose Mint authority. (*)

This has several things wrong with it.  Rule 1435 is silent as to
whether Indulgences have a Mintor or not, so there is no conflict on
this point with R1579.  Thus any "re-establishment" of the currency
must follow the first sentence of R1579, which insists that each
Currency has a Mintor.

Further, the whole notion does not give sufficient respect to the
natural meaning of "cease to exist".  A rule mandating that something
ceases to exist does not mean for the thing to have its existence
interrupted temporarily and then re-appear.  If R1579 is strong enough
to destroy Indulgences (or P-notes) as a currency, then it is strong
enough to keep them destroyed.

This brings us to the central question: _is_ R1579 strong enough to do
what it says?  Well, does it conflict with R1435?  No.  R1435 simply
says that Indulgences are a Currency; R1579 says that they are in fact
a destroyed Currency. (**) This is similar to the repeal of a Rule;
longstanding Game Custom holds that a Rule or Proposal which repeals
another Rule is not for that sole reason in conflict with it. (***)
Thus 1579 did cause Indulgences to cease to exist, and they still
cease to exist to the present time.

NOTES:

(*) This possibility was raised during the discussion of the issues
surrounding a similar situation with regards to P-notes, so it is as
well to dispose of it here.

(**) My fellow learned Justice Michael objected that an earlier
version involves a "secret" insertion of "defunct" into the rule.
This wording is what I meant.

(***) My fellow learned Justice Michael also objected here, pointing
out that Rules and Rule changes occupy separate worlds.  But I feel
this misses the point of my analogy: a Rule Change (proposed or
unproposed) is effective only by virtue of Rules that allow it to take
effect.  Do those Rules (which affect the content of the Ruleset)
actually _conflict_ with the Rule being repealed?

This would be like having an implicit clause in each Rule that stated
"This rule may not be repealed"; game custom says it does not.
Similarly, Rule 1479 does not contain an implied "this currency may
not be destroyed" as part of its defining sentence.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Justice Michael's decision: OVERTURN/reverse

If Indulgences exist, then a Payment Order was executed by the
Chancellor when he attempted to transfer 9 Indulgences from the Bank
to Elde.

If Indulgences exist, then the Indulgence Currency's Recordkeepor is
authorised to record and execute Payment Orders (R1596).

Thus, if Indulgences exist, the correct judgement for this CFJ is
FALSE.

The argument that Indulgences do not exist is based on R1579, which
states that all Currencies have a Mintor and if a Currency should lose
its Mintor, then it is destroyed.  It is accepted that an entity known
as the Mint was the Mintor for Indulgences before the Pragmatic
Currencies reform occurred.

By virtue of R1586, we must also accept that the Mint no longer
exists, so it would appear that the antecedent of the conditional
sentence of the second paragraph in R1597 holds.  So, what might
prevent Indulgences from being destroyed, as required by R1579?

The answer is the precedence taking R1435.  This states that
"Indulgences are a Currency".  This statement must remain true,
whatever R1579 says to the contrary.  My Fellow Justice elJefe claims
that this is possible if one reads "Indulgences are a Currency" as
"Indulgences are a destroyed Currency".

This is a senseless contortion.  We do not need to put the rules
through such hoops.  We have rules taking precedence over each other
all the time.  When we read "Indulgences are a Currency", we know that
this is equivalent to stating that there exists a Currency whose name
is "Indulgences".  But now the opposing argument wants us to
simultaneously read this as admitting the precise opposite, that this
Currency doesn't exist at all.

I refuse to make the Rules play such tricks.  If a high precedence
rule says that Indulgences exist, then the lower precedence R1579 can
yammer on about Mintors and the lack thereof all it likes.

Indulgences exist.

Rule 1596 should be interpreted so that a message purporting to
be a Payment Order must, in order to satisfy that Rule's requirements
and qualify as a legal Payment Order, explicitly and unambiguously
state that the purported Payor is ordered to effect a payment as
a consequence of that message, e.g. by stating "Player X is commanded
to pay Y", the mere mention of an amount of a Currency, the name or

(Caller's) Arguments (slighted edited):

See my argument above concerning retroactive rule effects.  Another
example may help (which is why I worded the CFJ as I did).  The disinfection of
R693 can be seen as assigning an historical significance to the ten days
following the distribution of each of these proposals.  It is like passing a
rule now which says, "September 1, 1997 through September 7, 1997 shall be
known as 'The Week of the Cumberbuns'".  This would retroactively give a
significance to those days, an effect which, I contend, is not prohibited by
R108.

'my argument above' is pointing to the following text (this line is
an insertion by the CotC):

H. CotC,

I hereby Call for Judgement on the following Statement :

---

Rule 1596 should be interpreted so that a message purporting to
be a Payment Order must, in order to satisfy that Rule's requirements
and qualify as a legal Payment Order, explicitly and unambiguously
state that the purported Payor is ordered to effect a payment as
a consequence of that message, e.g. by stating "Player X is commanded
to pay Y", the mere mention of an amount of a Currency, the name or
names of the Payor and Payee, or a reference to some Rule or some
situation that requires a Payment Order to be executed being
insufficient for a message not containing such a command or entreaty
to qualify as a Payment Order.

---

Arguments :

I believe this follows from Rule 1596's definition of a Payment Order
as "an order requiring an entity to" perform some action, and that no
message not framed as a command is a legal Payment Order.

Note that the claim that a particular message _is_ a Payment Order
is by that reasoning sufficient to satisfy Rule 1596's requirement.

I kindly request that the Judge of the CFJ enjoin the Rulekeepor to
annotate R1596 with the above statement and the list of relevant
Rules which follows : 1596.

>From the judgement:

As I explained in an earlier post, I think no such "instant" ever
--erm, what do instants do? exist? happen? well, never mind... --
anyway, there never was such an instant. That's why 1527 speaks of
infinitesimal time separations, not simply of small ones.

So the bank became mintor in time to save VTs, and so on and so on.

I find Kolja's analysis of 1527/376 interesting, and at the very least
it deserves closer examination.  I therefore call for the appeal of
CFJ 933.

Decision of the Justiciar: SUSTAIN the judgement of FALSE

For trivial reasons.  The date in the statement is wrong for the caller's
argument to work, and there is no other reason for thinking the statement
true.

This is a factual error, not a spelling (etc.) error, nor the use of a
synonym or abbreviation, so I can't use Rule 754 to Judge the statement
that was probably intended.

The caller states:

>However, the Frankenstein Monster, at the time specified in the
>statement, contained the sentence
>
>      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Frankenstein Monster
>      is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing

>      or implicitly permits it.

This sentence was reported on 6 September 1997, _not_ at the time specified
in the Statement.

The only sentence addition reported on Mon, 11 August 1997, was:

      A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.


There is no reason to think that this addition made changes impossible.

Actually, Scott has already appealed it. And so, hereby, do I. Now 
unless someone else steps forward, I guess Elde or Blob might do

                               CFJ 938

"Rule 1513 should be interpreted such that, if a body of text has been
 read by a Player, then it shall not lack the power to require that
 Player to perform or not perform an action solely because the Rules
 fail to require that it be made available to that Player."

  Assigned to Steve, Mon, 8 Sep 1997 10:23:44 +0200 (MET DST)

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Rule 1513 ends with this text:

     Especially, no body of text is permitted to require Players to
     perform or not perform any actions unless said body of text has
     previously been made available to that Player.

This says "Text T can bind Player P only if P has read T"; it does not
say "Text T can bind Player P only if the Rules require that P can
receive a copy of T".

======================================================================

Decision and Reasoning Judge:

I Judge the Statement TRUE. Clearly any body of text that a Player has
read has been made available to that Player, under any definition of
what it means to be 'made available'. I don't necessarily accept the
suggestion made by the Caller that having been read by the Player is
a necessary condition for a text to have been made available to that
Player, but it certainly is sufficient.

Attention Rulekeepor! This CFJ contains an Injunction to annotate
a Rule!

======================================================================

                               CFJ 939

The provision in R1504 which states that:

      Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their
      legal report, and the Player making the report of the Infraction
      shall execute whatever Payment Order(s) are required to apply
      the penalty specified for that Infraction. 

should be interpreted such that penalties for Infractions are applied
immediately upon the legal report of the *penalties*, not the legal
report of the Infractions.

======================================================================

Judge:       Zefram

Judgement:   TRUE

Eligible:    Antimatter, Blob, Calabresi, ChrisM, Chuck, Elde, elJefe,

Injunction:

 and the list of relevant Rules.

  Judged TRUE by Zefram, 16 Sep 1997 09:59:01 +0100

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

I reproduce as my argument the one I gave for the same conclusion
in my Judgement of CFJ 937:

"It's worth commenting at this point on an ambiguity in R1504: it's
not clear whether the report of the Infraction and the report of the
gain in Blots have to be made in the same message, or whether the
report of gain in Blots can follow the report of the Infraction by up
to seven days. The first sentence [sic] of R1504 states that
"Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their legal
report". But the legal report of what: the penalties or the
infractions? If infractions is meant, R1504 is somewhat in tension
with itself, since it immediately goes on to imply (along with other
Rules, eg R1599) that the application of the penalty can be later
than the report of the Infraction. So I read R1504 as saying that
penalties for Infractions are applied at the time the penalty is
reported, which can be later than the time the Infraction is reported."

Requested Injunction:

I request that the Judge of the CFJ issue an Injunction requesting
the Rulekeepor to annotate R1504 with the statement and the list
of relevant Rules below, as e is permitted to do by R789.

Relevant Rules: 1504, 1599

====================================================================

Judge's Reasoning:

The first clause of the provision in question says

      Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their
      legal report

As a native English speaker, I have no hesitation in interpreting the
word "their" in this context to refer to "Penalties for Infractions".
The alternative interpretation, with the antecedent being "Infractions",
is a less natural (though still valid) construct.  Given such an
ambiguity, the more natural interpretation of the language must be used.

======================================================================
                               CFJ 940

Rule 1596 should be interpreted so that a message purporting to
be a Payment Order must, in order to satisfy that Rule's requirements
and qualify as a legal Payment Order, explicitly and unambiguously
state that the purported Payor is ordered to effect a payment as
a consequence of that message, e.g. by stating "Player X is commanded
to pay Y", the mere mention of an amount of a Currency, the name or
names of the Payor and Payee, or a reference to some Rule or some
situation that requires a Payment Order to be executed being
insufficient for a message not containing such a command or entreaty
to qualify as a Payment Order.

  Judged TRUE by Chuck, 14 Sep 1997, 16:11 CDT

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

I believe this follows from Rule 1596's definition of a Payment Order
as "an order requiring an entity to" perform some action, and that no
message not framed as a command is a legal Payment Order.

Note that the claim that a particular message _is_ a Payment Order
is by that reasoning sufficient to satisfy Rule 1596's requirement.

I kindly request that the Judge of the CFJ enjoin the Rulekeepor to
annotate R1596 with the above statement and the list of relevant
Rules which follows : 1596.

======================================================================\

Decision and Reasoning Judge:

I judge this statement to be TRUE.

Injunction:
I hereby enjoin the Rulekeepor to annotate Rule 1596
with the statement and list of relevant Rules of this CFJ.

Reasons and Arguments:
I agree with the Caller's arguments.

                               CFJ 941

All proposed Amendments to the Frankenstein Rule were made impossible
by the Frankenstein Generator when the change to the Frankenstein
Monster assigned to "Week 1", reported by the Mad Scientist on Mon,
11 August 1997, took effect.

  Judged FALSE by Vlad, 16 Sep 1997 00:16 -0500 (CDT)

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

The Frankenstein Generator, 1672, requires among other things that 

      vii) All proposed Amendments to the Frankenstein Rule must
           consist of a single sentence of additional text specifying
           the properties and effects of a Frankenstein Monster, to be
           inserted between the first and last paragraphs.

However, the Frankenstein Monster, at the time specified in the
statement, contained the sentence

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Frankenstein Monster 
      is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing 
      the Frankenstein Monsters, which is permitted only when a 
      Frankenstein Monster or set of Frankenstein Monsters explicitly
      or implicitly permits it.

It did not, however, contain any explicit or implicit permissions
permitting such changes.

The introduction of additional text "specifying the properties and
effects of a Frankenstein Monster" is equivalent to "changing the
Frankenstein Monsters". So the FM prohibits the only proposed
amendments to the FR allowed by the FG.
(Note that amendments that change nothing are excluded by point

       vi) No Amendment can be applied to the Frankenstein Rule that
           is substantially the same as any prior successfully applied
           Amendment to the Frankenstein Rule.

of 1672)

Admittedly, this argument has two ossible weaknesses: The equivalence
stated in the preceding paragraph may be challenged. But I consider
this equivalence to hold - let the judge decide for emself.

And the FM also contains the sentence

      A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.

But I would say that, while the FM is permitted to define such
mechanisms, it doesn't actually do it, so this sentence establishes no
explicit or implicit permission to change the FM, after all.

======================================================================

Decision & Arguments Judge:

I find the Statement FALSE.

The Caller's arguments included the following:

      or implicitly permits it.

It did not, however, contain any explicit or implicit permissions
permitting such changes.

------------------------

However, the Frankenstein Rule does contain the following clause:

A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.
---------------

"Any change to a Frankenstein Monster adopted in accordance with its
own mechanisms is legal." Now, in the absence of any clearly specified
mechanisms, is a given Amendment in accordance with them or not? Well,
your mileage may differ, but I consider this to be almost trivially true.
One cannot be in conflict with a non-existent law. Therefore, I declare
that (as of this time), the Frankenstein Monster gives implicit
permission to change itself.

Rule 1596 should be interpreted so that a message purporting to

names of the Payor and Payee, or a reference to some Rule or some
situation that requires a Payment Order to be executed being
insufficient for a message not containing such a command or entreaty
to qualify as a Payment Order.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

I believe this follows from Rule 1596's definition of a Payment Order
as "an order requiring an entity to" perform some action, and that no
message not framed as a command is a legal Payment Order.

Note that the claim that a particular message _is_ a Payment Order
is by that reasoning sufficient to satisfy Rule 1596's requirement.

I kindly request that the Judge of the CFJ enjoin the Rulekeepor to
annotate R1596 with the above statement and the list of relevant
Rules which follows : 1596.

======================================================================

Decision and Reasoning Judge:

I judge this statement to be TRUE.

Injunction:
I hereby enjoin the Rulekeepor to annotate Rule 1596
with the statement and list of relevant Rules of this CFJ.

Reasons and Arguments:
I agree with the Caller's arguments.

======================================================================

Decision and Reasoning CotC:

In the issue of the Appelate decision of CFJ 940 I find the Judgement
incorrect. To me the fact that something is a Payment Order makes it
a priori what a Payment Order is defined to be, no matter in what
exact form it is brought out.

As can be seen from the discussions on agora-discussion it is not easy
to decide when a certain text is a Payment Order and when it isn't.
However, we are not to judge on that, as the premisse in the Statement
already is that the message is purporting to be a Payment Order.
Any phrase making it clear that a text is a Payment Order, makes it so,
provided that the provisions in the second sentence of Rule 1596 are
met. If further it is posted to the Public Forum, and by a Player with
the authority to execute it, it is executed.

I thus find the Judgement incorrect, and request REVERSAL of the
Judgement.

======================================================================

Decision and Reasoning Justiciar:

Decision of the Justiciar:   FALSE (reversing the original Judgement)

Rule 1596 begins:

      A Payment Order is an order requiring an entity (the payor) to
      submit a Transfer Order transferring units of a Currency from
      itself to some other entity (the payee).  A Payment Order
      specifies exactly one source entity, exactly one destination
      entity, exactly one Currency, and a number of units of that
      Currency which is a positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ.

The question is whether one could devise something that is unambiguously
(but not explicitly) an order, requiring a specified entity to submit a TO
for a specified amount of currency from itself to another specified entity,
_without_ explicitly and unambiguously stating that the purported Payor is
ordered to effect a payment as a consequence of that message.  I believe we
can.

Any ambiguity in the payee, payor, or amount of currency fails the Rule's
requirement that these are "specified".   "The Bank is ordered to pay
Player X" is not sufficient (though this sentence could possibly be part of
a complete and valid PO).  But if I say that "I order the Bank to pay 1 VT
to Player X," that is explicit and is a Payment Order, assuming I had
authority to issue it.

Suppose we do not _explicitly_ state that the Bank is commanded to effect a
payment as a consequence.  If the Speaker says "Player X is awarded one VT
from the Bank, for meritorious conduct," then this alone is not
unambiguously an order and on its own would not be a PO.  (As others have
pointed out, it could just be an observation.)

However, this sentence together with other text could be an order.  Suppose
the Speaker posts a message consisting of

        --------------------------------------------
                      OFFICIAL NOTICE
                    Speaker's Patronage

        Player X is awarded one VT from the Bank,
        for meritorious conduct.
        --------------------------------------------

Surely in the old days the person responsible for recording VTs would have
treated this entire message as an order and felt required to act upon it.
It unambiguously (but not explicitly) requires the Bank to pay a specified
amount of currency to a specified player, and nowadays that will mean
issuing a Transfer Order. Thus it satisfies all the requirements for a PO.

This is sufficient to determine the decision, so I will not lengthen this
decision by considering Blots.  But I will say that these are a thorny
issue involving interactions of rules, and the question of whether an order
can "specify" things like payees, payors, and amounts, by having the
players delve into various Rules to determine them.  It is not clear.

Regards,
-- elJefe, Justiciar

======================================================================

Decision and Reasoning Speaker:

It is the opinion of the Speaker that the Judgement in CFJ 940 should
be OVERTURNED, and that the original Judgement be REVERSED.

I concur with my fellow Justices on this matter.  While there is
indeed a substantial issue as to whether certain phrases are or are
not Payment Orders, the requirements expressed in the Statement of
this CFJ go far beyond the statutory requirements of Rule 1596.  I see
no reason to believe that Rule 1596 requires that any of the elements
of a Payment Order (Payee, Payor, Currency, or amount) be _explicitly_
specified in a message which purports to convey a Payment Order.  All
that need be required is that the message be clearly identifiable as
conveying a Payment Order, and that all of the elements of the Payment
Order thus conveyed be determinable with reasonable certainty, either
from being explicitly stated within that message, or reasonably
deducible from the context in which that message was sent.  I leave
the question as to what constitutes "reasonably deducible" and
"reasonable certainty" to future Judges; it is not an issue in this
matter.

I also take issue with the claim that a message might purport to be a
Payment Order.  A message may purport to convey a Payment Order, but
all Rule 1596 states is that a Payment Order is an order.  There is no
reason to believe that an order is a message; rather, I contend that
messages are a means (and, in this case, the sole legally effective
mean) to convey orders to their obligees.  The confusion is
understandable, but I do not wish this confusion of terms to become
entrenched, and so I take this opportunity to expound upon it.

Respectfully submitted,

General Chaos
Speaker of Agora Nomic

                               CFJ 941

All proposed Amendments to the Frankenstein Rule were made impossible
by the Frankenstein Generator when the change to the Frankenstein
Monster assigned to "Week 1", reported by the Mad Scientist on Mon,
11 August 1997, took effect.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

The Frankenstein Generator, 1672, requires among other things that 

      vii) All proposed Amendments to the Frankenstein Rule must
           consist of a single sentence of additional text specifying
           the properties and effects of a Frankenstein Monster, to be
           inserted between the first and last paragraphs.

However, the Frankenstein Monster, at the time specified in the
statement, contained the sentence

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Frankenstein Monster 
      is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing 
      the Frankenstein Monsters, which is permitted only when a 
      Frankenstein Monster or set of Frankenstein Monsters explicitly
      or implicitly permits it.

It did not, however, contain any explicit or implicit permissions
permitting such changes.

The introduction of additional text "specifying the properties and
effects of a Frankenstein Monster" is equivalent to "changing the
Frankenstein Monsters". So the FM prohibits the only proposed
amendments to the FR allowed by the FG.
(Note that amendments that change nothing are excluded by point

       vi) No Amendment can be applied to the Frankenstein Rule that
           is substantially the same as any prior successfully applied
           Amendment to the Frankenstein Rule.

of 1672)

Admittedly, this argument has two ossible weaknesses: The equivalence
stated in the preceding paragraph may be challenged. But I consider
this equivalence to hold - let the judge decide for emself.

And the FM also contains the sentence

      A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.

But I would say that, while the FM is permitted to define such
mechanisms, it doesn't actually do it, so this sentence establishes no
explicit or implicit permission to change the FM, after all.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

I find the Statement FALSE.

The Caller's arguments included the following:

It did not, however, contain any explicit or implicit permissions

------------------------

However, the Frankenstein Rule does contain the following clause:

A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.
---------------

"Any change to a Frankenstein Monster adopted in accordance with its
own mechanisms is legal." Now, in the absence of any clearly specified
mechanisms, is a given Amendment in accordance with them or not? Well,
your mileage may differ, but I consider this to be almost trivially true.
One cannot be in conflict with a non-existent law. Therefore, I declare
that (as of this time), the Frankenstein Monster gives implicit
permission to change itself.

Vlad

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Justiciar:

Decision of the Justiciar: SUSTAIN the judgement of FALSE

For trivial reasons.  The date in the statement is wrong for the caller's
argument to work, and there is no other reason for thinking the statement
true.

This is a factual error, not a spelling (etc.) error, nor the use of a
synonym or abbreviation, so I can't use Rule 754 to Judge the statement
that was probably intended.

The caller states:

>      or implicitly permits it.

This sentence was reported on 6 September 1997, _not_ at the time specified
in the Statement.

The only sentence addition reported on Mon, 11 August 1997, was:

      A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.


There is no reason to think that this addition made changes impossible.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Speaker:

It is the opinion of the Speaker that the Judgement in CFJ 941 should
be OVERTURNED, that the original Judgement be VACATED, and the
original CFJ DISMISSED.

The Statement of CFJ 941 refers to the "change to the Frankenstein
Monster assigned to 'Week 1', reported by the Mad Scientist on Mon, 11
August 1997".  This entity does not exist; nothing in the Report of
the Mad Scientist posted on 11 August 1997 assigned anything to 'Week
1', as my fellow Justice elJefe has noted. 

There are two schools of reasoning regarding the truth values of
statements which contain definite descriptions of entities which do
not exist; one school holds that all such statements are categorically
FALSE, while the other holds that such statements are not well-formed
and thus have no truth value.  I am of the latter school.  I find that
the Statement of CFJ 941 "can not logically admit to either being TRUE
or FALSE", and therefore this CFJ should properly have been dismissed
under Rule 1565(ii).

Respectfully submitted,

General Chaos
Speaker, Agora Nomic

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning CotC:

As my fellow Justice elJefe already noted, the change claimed to make
future Amendments impossible, was not reported on 11 August, although
some other, much less dangerous change was. However, there is something
more to discuss. As can be seen from the actual 11 August report,
there is no ''change to the Frankenstein Monster assigned to "Week 1", 
reported by the Mad Scientist on Mon, 11 August 1997,'' and thus also
no time when it took effect.

To General Chaos this has let to a dismissal, as the truth of a statement
about a non-existing object cannot be decided, and even has no logical
meaning. However, I would not go that far. In my opinion some statements
can and other can't be decided. "The pink unicorn has 678 legs" is
undecidable, but "The pink unicorn has made me pregnant" is false. Maybe
it has to do with its effects on reality. But what about "All proposed 
Amendments to the Frankenstein Rule were made impossible by the 
Frankenstein Generator when the pink unicorn was born"? It's a close call,
but to me it is false. And so I judge.

Normally it's my opinion that in case the decisive points are points that
neither the Judge nor the Appellants (how is that spelled?) have mentioned,
the Court of Appeals should ask for rejudgement, but in this case it is
clear that either FALSE or Dismissal is right, and their difference is of
no importance.

Thus, I call for SUSTAINing the Judgement of FALSE.

H. Clerk of the Courts,

Because I will be away from email and work most of this and next week
I would like to make myself ineligible to judge the recent CFJ called
by Steve ("Calabresi is ineligible to serve as a Justice in the Appeal
of CFJ 933") according to 1567.

H. Clerk of the Courts,

For the same reason given in my last mail I would also like to make
myself ineligible to judge the recent CFJ called by Morendil ("General
Chaos committed the Crime of Wrongful COE denial") according to 1567.

I am afraid that a long as I don't go on hold I'll have to do this
separately for each new CFJ, according to the wording of 1567, right?
Sorry for the extra work involved.

>
>"All Voting Tokens were destroyed as a result of the Pragmatic
> Currencies Proposal taking effect."
>
>======================================================================
Decision of the Justiciar: TRUE (sustaining the original Judgement)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Judge Elde/Morendil argues that during implementation of the Proposal, a
rule change caused the Mint to cease being a mintor when it was the mintor
of VTs, before another rule change made the Bank the mintor of VTs.

There are several different interpretations on how the provisions of a
Proposal are implemented, which may affect the argument.  (For example, if
the provisions are implemented simultaneously, then the Mint did not cease
to be a mintor _before_ the Bank was mintor.)

But no matter which interpretation is chosen, it remains that the Mint
_did_ cease to have Mint Authority.  CFJ 828 (Destruction of Group Coins)
teaches that this is enough to satisfy the precise wording of Rule 1579,
even if it could be shown that VTs had a mintor at every legally
significant time.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Original Judge's argument

Proposal 3533, the Pragmatic Currencies proposal, was implemented under
authority of Rule 594.  Judge Elde argues that at the time Rule 1470 was
amended (depriving the Mint of Mint Authority),  Rule 1696 still named the
Mint as the Mintor for VTs. The conclusion is that Rule 1579 acted at that
moment to destroy all Voting Tokens.


2. How the provisions of a Proposal are implemented

There are several interpretations of the Rules on how the provisions of a
Proposal are implemented.

The Sequential View:   Each provision is implemented in order, if allowed
                       by the Rules then in effect, and the Game State is
                       adjusted to include consequent effects of this before
                       turning to the next provision.

The Atomic View:       Each provision is implemented in order, if allowed
                       by the Rules in effect at the adoption of the Proposal,
                       but no consequent effects cause an adjustment to the
                       Game State until all provisions have been dealt with.

The Simultaneous View: All the provisions are considered to be implemented
                       simultaneously,  if allowed by the Rules in effect
                       at the adoption of the Proposal, except where
                       dependencies among the provisions require that some
                       are implemented in sequence with other ones.

All three of these are consistent with the Rules, and the choice between
them must therefore rest on "game custom, commonsense, past Judgements, and
the best interests of the game."

The present decision does not require us to choose among these, and thus we
refrain from expressing an opinion as to which is preferred.


3.  Destruction of Game Coins, CFJ 828

It's fair to compare the present situation to the one arising in CFJ 828.
In that case, Proposal 1760 had revamped the Group rules but had forgotten
to provide that each Group was the mintor of its own Group Coins, or in
fact that Groups were permitted to be the mintors of anything.  However, a
Rule (1467) provided that "The Mintor of a Currency is the Mint if it is
not otherwise defined."

But the clear meaning of Rule 1471, worded very much like the two most
recent forms of Rule 1579, is that when one entity ceases to have authority
to mint a currency and another begins to have that authority in its stead,
then that currency is indeed destroyed.

The judgement in CFJ 828 states:
>Rule 1474/0 clearly said that the Mintor for a Group's Coins was the
>Group. That language was amended away by Proposal 1760, and the Group
>issuing the Coins then ceased to have authority to be a Mintor, that
>authority now going to the Mint.

Rule 1579/1 partly stated:
      If the designated Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist or ceases
      to possess Mint Authority, all units of that Currency are
      destroyed and the Currency ceases to exist.

Rule 1579/2 partly stated:
      If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist, or ceases to have
      the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that Currency
      are destroyed, and that Currency ceases to exist.


The inclusion of "designated" in Rule 1579/1 is not enough to change the
result.  The meaning of "mintor" and "designated mintor" have at all times
been the same, namely the mintor designated by the Rules.

Thus I rule that the statement was correctly judged TRUE.


Regards,
-- elJefe, Justiciar

Decision & Reasoning Judge (Michael):

I wish to dismiss all of the CFJs to which I have been assigned on the
grounds that they are not relevant to the game, a justification which
is admissible by virtue of R1565, clause iii.  

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge (Zefram):

I hereby Judge as follows:

977: TRUE
998: FALSE
1001: TRUE

Oh yeah? I hereby dismiss the following CFJs assigned to me under 
*R1563*.  :)

947, 966, 969, 976, 980, 1002, 1003, 1029, and 1034.




I do not believe that they are  "able to be
      determined by the means of logical reasoning, with the
      presumption of perfect knowledge, to be either TRUE or FALSE."
      
In addition, I consider them "vacuous" under this same rule.

Note that only one of these conditions needs to be met to dismiss 
them...I include both in the hopes of avoiding argumentation. Not that I 
really have any hope of that. :)

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge (elJefe):

I hereby DISMISS CFJs 1018, 1028, and 1030 under Rule 1565(iii), as their
statements do not relate to matters relevant to the Rules.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge (Andre):

I hereby dismiss CFJs 965, 992, 1006 and 1040 because their Statement does
not relate to a matter relevant to the Rules, and CFJs 974, 1004 and 1031
because no determination can be made of the truth or falsity of their
Statement.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge (Crito):

I notice that the R1563 requires me to dismiss all of these CFJs since the
statement is vacuous, in that it can be judged either true or false without any
logical inconsistency.  Therefore,

I hereby dismiss CFJ 954.
I hereby dismiss CFJ 983.
I hereby dismiss CFJ 996.
I hereby dismiss CFJ 1016.
I hereby dismiss CFJ 1039.

BTW, it may not be a good idea for all of us to send our Judgements to the
PF. Please note that it is completely legal to send it to CotC Andre
instead. I am sending this to the PF because I got the odd one out and
I wish to solicit comments.

I hereby Dismiss both of these CFJs under 1565 (iii): these Statements
are (obviously) not relevant to the Rules.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge (Vir):

I hereby dismiss CFJs 950, 979, 988, 1005, 1020, and 1041 under Rule 1563
because they cannot be determined logically to be either TRUE or FALSE and
because they are vacuous.

I dismiss CFJ 952 on the grounds that it cannot be determined by the
means of logical reasoning, with the presumption of perfect knowledge,
to be either TRUE or FALSE.

>	     985: Chuck

I dismiss CFJ 985 on the grounds that it is vacuous.

>	    1010: Chuck

I dismiss CFJ 1010 on the grounds that its statement does not
relate to a matter relevant to the Rules.

>	    1014: Chuck

I dismiss CFJ 1014 on the grounds that after a reasonable effort
by the Judge to obtain all relevant inforamtion, no determination
can be made of the truth or falsity of its statement.

>	    1044: Chuck

I dismiss CFJ 1044 on the grounds that Rules 1563 and 1565 require me
to do so.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge (Murphy):

I do not dismiss CFJ 962 per 1565/iii ("Its Statement does not relate to a
matter relevant to the Rules").  The Statement of CFJ 962 obviously relates
to CFJ 962 itself, which is a matter relevant to the Rules.  (If this
argument is to be believed, then no CFJ may be dismissed per 1565/iii,
which should therefore be reworded.)

However, I do dismiss CFJ 962 on the following grounds:

* 1565/vi:   After a reasonable effort by the Judge to obtain all relevant
               information, no determination can be made of the truth or
               falsity of its Statement.
* 1563:      Its Statement is unable to be determined by the means of
               logical reasoning, with the presumption of perfect knowledge,
               to be either TRUE or FALSE.

I interpret these clauses as they were surely intended, namely "no
determination can be made as to whether or not its Statement is true"
and "It is impossible to determine ... whether or not its Statement is
true", as opposed to the alternate convoluted interpretations that have
recently been offered.

I dismiss CFJ  978, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ  982, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ  984, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ  989, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ  990, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ  994, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1019, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1021, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1022, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1026, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1027, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1032, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1036, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1043, on the same grounds.

I'll take my 45 Mil in 5-Mark notes, please.  :)

I hereby dismiss these CFJs, since they do not admit to either truth
or falsity.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge (General Chaos):

I hereby DISMISS CFJs 946, 960, 981, 995, 1000, and 1012, each for the
reason that its Statement "does not relate to a matter relevant to the
Rules" (Rule 1565(iii)) and for the reason that its Statement is
vacuous (Rule 1563).

Assuming the above was successfully executed, I too dismiss
any CFJs currently assigned to me in the ranges 945-970 or 972-1044, on
the grounds of their being inadmissable under Rules 1563 or 1565.

======================================================================

Evidence (added by Judge Chuck): Rule 1563 and 1565

Rule 1563/1 (Power=1)
Statement of a CFJ

      In order to be Judged, a Call for Judgement must contain a
      single clearly-labeled Statement which must be able to be
      determined by the means of logical reasoning, with the
      presumption of perfect knowledge, to be either TRUE or FALSE.
      Statements which are inherently contradictory or which are
      vacuous are not acceptable, and a CFJ containing such a
      Statement shall not be Judged.

      If a Call for Judgement does not contain a Statement of the sort
      required by this Rule, its Judge is required to dismiss the CFJ,
      as described elsewhere.

      It is permitted for a Call for Judgement to contain Arguments,
      Evidence, or other material placed there at the Caller's
      discretion.  However, the Judge is not required to take notice
      of any part of the CFJ other than the Statement in formulating
      eir Judgement.

Created by Proposal 2457, Feb. 16 1996
Null-Amended(1) by Proposal 3454 (Harlequin), Apr. 7 1997, cosmetic
  (unattributed)

Rule 1565/3 (Power=1)
Dismissal of a CFJ

      A Judge must dismiss a CFJ if one of the following is true of
      it:

        i) It contains no clearly-identifiable Statement.
       ii) Its Statement can not logically admit to either being TRUE
           or FALSE.
      iii) Its Statement does not relate to a matter relevant to the
           Rules.
       iv) Its Statement fails to comply with the Rules.
        v) It lacks standing, as defined elsewhere.
       vi) After a reasonable effort by the Judge to obtain all
           relevant information, no determination can be made of the
           truth or falsity of its Statement.

      The Judge does this by notifying the CotC of the CFJ's
      dismissal, and the reasons e is doing so.  Dismissals are only
      legal when made for the reasons listed in this Rule, and when
      only when issued by the Judge within the permitted deliberation
      period.  Dismissal occurs when the CotC is notified of a legal
      dismissal.

      As soon as possible after being notified of a legal dismissal,
      the CotC must post to the Public Forum a notice of the dismissal
      and the Judge's reasons for doing so.

      If the dismissal, upon appeal, is subsequently set aside, then
      that CFJ is no longer dismissed. It shall be considered again
      and can not again be legally dismissed for the same reasons.

      A Judge who dismisses a CFJ shall receive a Judicial Salary of 3
      Mil.

CFJ 909, Mar. 17 1997: The phrase 'considered again' in Rule 1565
should be interpreted such that when a dismissal of a CFJ has been set
aside, the Clerk of the Courts should assign the CFJ to a new Judge
selected from among those eligible, who then has one week to deliver a
Judgement.

If you accept that, it will make life much easier, so I hereby request

Oh, hell, why doesn't somebody do the following.

I hereby make a Call For Judgment on the following statement, barring
Oerjan and Morendil:

Statement: The Rules lack agency.

Argument: The Rules derive their authority from the General Will of all
the Players. Any appearance of agency then seem to have is derived from
that authority.

Scott, read the Judgement again.  I think you'll find there are
more than 4 Injunctions there.

I hereby call for the appeal of all Injunctions issued with
the Judgement of CFJ 1045.

  Judged TRUE by Morendil, 30 Sep 1997 17:51:10 +0100

============================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

In CFJ 1045, I find the Statement to be TRUE.

I am in essential agreement with the Caller that Rule 1563 provides
more than adequate justification for Dismissing the named CFJs, in
spite of some arduous wording which made it briefly tempting - given
the rewards of returning a Judgement on, rather than Dismiss, these
CFJs - to wriggle my way out of it.


But wait, there is more.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the sum total of
Payment Orders in Indulgences naming that Player as Payor that they
have thus far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the sum total of Payment
Orders in Voting Tokens naming that Player as Payor that they have
thus far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Proposal Notes equal to the sum total of
Payment Orders in Indulgences naming that Player as Payor that they
have thus far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to the Registrar, requiring em to issue, for each Player, a
Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, that Player as Payee, for an
amount of 5 VTs. (So we can Vote on Proposals, y'know...)

The above facially satisfy provisions i) through iv) of Rule 663
pertaining to Injunctions; it is my belief that they also satisfy v), 
though that requires us to examine any Rule relevant thereto. I
find one, Rule 1736 itself, which states

      The Rules may require, in certain cases, that a Judge issue an
      Injunction ordering the execution of a Payment Order.  If the
      Payment Order required by such an Injunction is executed, and
      the Injunction itself later set aside, the Player who executed
      the required Payment Order shall, as soon as possible after the
      Injunction was set aside, vacate that Payment Order.

This merely states that Rules are permitted to require Judges to
issue Injuctions under certain circumstances; it is as far as I can
see no bar to a Judge taking it upon emself to issue any legal
Injuction. No prohibition of any kind in fact obtains with respect
to issuing Injuctions defined in 1736/1737; the procedure for issuing
an Injunction is well delineated, and followed to a T in this
Judgement; issuing an Injunctions in the present circumstances is 
therefore possible and unprohibited, which I submit is all that 'in a 
manner consistent with the Rules' requires.

Lastly, a note as to intent - obviously, this loophole can be used
for massive personal gain (well, once the status of Currencies has
been determined), and just as obviously it will be extremely tempting
for other Players assigned to Judge CFJs to take advantage of it for
the same reasons. It could also be used to summarily deregister 
anyone from the Game by assigning them 31 Blots.

There is no limit to how far this could be abused; if everyone jumps
on that bandwagon, all we will do is spoil the game absolutely.
Better we should fix that loophole, and quick, and refrain from
doing anything else about it for the sake of preserving the game's
fun.

I think the above is even-handed enough that Players (especially
Justices or Judges with CFJs currently assigned to em) will see their
own interest in letting it stand at that.

(And remember, you ain't seen nothing yet.)

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:


Relevant Rules: 1563

Rule 1563/1 (Power=1)
Statement of a CFJ

      In order to be Judged, a Call for Judgement must contain a
      single clearly-labeled Statement which must be able to be
      determined by the means of logical reasoning, with the
      presumption of perfect knowledge, to be either TRUE or FALSE.
      Statements which are inherently contradictory or which are
      vacuous are not acceptable, and a CFJ containing such a
      Statement shall not be Judged.

      If a Call for Judgement does not contain a Statement of the sort
      required by this Rule, its Judge is required to dismiss the CFJ,
      as described elsewhere.

      It is permitted for a Call for Judgement to contain Arguments,
      Evidence, or other material placed there at the Caller's
      discretion.  However, the Judge is not required to take notice
      of any part of the CFJ other than the Statement in formulating
      eir Judgement.

Before I begin arguing, I'd like to say that when I refer to "the
statement", I refer to the statement "This statement is TRUE.", and when I
refer to "the CFJ", I'm referring to the CFJ I am submitting.  I'm keeping
this consistancy so that it's clear what I am talking about.

The statement "This statement is TRUE." cannot be determined to be either
TRUE or FALSE by means of logical reasoning.

If the statement is TRUE, then it follows that the statement is TRUE, and
there's no contradiction.  If the statement is FALSE, then it follows that
the statement is FALSE, and there's no contradiction.  Therefore, the
statement is both TRUE and FALSE and is not either TRUE or FALSE.

The statement is also vacuous, and is therefore not acceptable.

vacuous (v*k*y-es) adjective
1.	Devoid of matter; empty.
2.	a. Lacking intelligence; stupid. b. Devoid of substance or meaning;
inane: a vacuous comment. c. Devoid of expression; vacant: "The narrow,
swinelike eyes were open, no more vacuous in death than they had been in
life" (Nicholas Proffitt).
3.	Lacking serious purpose or occupation; idle. See synonyms at EMPTY.
[From Latin vacuus, empty. See VACUUM.]
- vac*uously adverb
- vac*uousness noun

The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Third Edition
copyright * 1992 by Houghton Mifflin Company. Electronic version licensed
from InfoSoft International, Inc. All rights reserved.

definitions 2b, 2c, and 3 all support the statement being vacuous.
definition 1 would imply an empty statement, like a null set, but then
there would be no statement to be vacuous, so definition 1 does not apply.
definition 2a is a matter of taste, so it does not apply.

The statement has not substance or meaning in game terms or in terms of
anything other than the statement.

I'd like to also note that this CFJ must be judged TRUE if it is determined
by the judge that the statement cannot be judged TRUE or FALSE by logical
reasoning or the statement is vacuous.  Either one of those being TRUE (or
both being true) makes this CFJ true.

I am reasonably convinced that CFJ 1045 is not a "certain case" in the
sense used by Rule 1736, and that Morendil's Injunctions are therefor
illegally made.  I therefore call for the Appeal of all four, and note
that my call is adequate in itself to force an Appeal of the first
three of them by virtue of being named in them.

Well, we might as well get things underway. I call for the Appeal
of all the Injunctions made by Morendil in his Judgement of CFJ 1045.
