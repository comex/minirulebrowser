                     6   6   6   6   6

Jester               A   F   F   F   F

Therefore I will vote against INP265 and for INP366-369. 

Thanks to all who voted/declared presence. 

H. Scorekeepor, please note: I hereby order a score gain of 1 point
for Oerjan, Chuck, Kolja A. and Jester for voting on INP referenda. (I
assume that just declaring presence does not count as "voting" in the
sense of R1784).

Conderning the result of INP264 no official announcement has been made
yet. However, it looks as though there was one vote against it, and
not more than three for, so probably it was rejected. I'm afraid that
Uri, the nre IN moderator, is playing very slowly (maybe that is one
of the reasons why some were interested in more explicit rules
concerning changes of the moderator?).
