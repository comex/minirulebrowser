I am currently the Clerk of the Courts, holding that position
temporarily, while the elections are being held.  I would prefer not
to have to pick up the various strands of the judicial process after
having been away for a week (during which time Andre was delegated
Clerk).

Therefore, I hereby resign my Office and appoint Andre to fill my
place.  By R790/6, this does not introduce the need to conduct a fresh
election. 

Michael. 
(PS: if Andre is not willing, which seems unlikely, then the Office
     automatically passes to the Speaker.)

The latest Notary's Report failed to report Morendil's Group antics, which
had already occurred when it was published.  That was a COE.  I admit the
COE and publish a correction below.
