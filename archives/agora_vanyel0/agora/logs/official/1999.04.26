1483 states, in part:


      A Proposal is created whenever a Proposing Entity delivers some

      collection of text to the Public Forum with the clear indication

      that that text is intended to become a Proposal.


I argue that there was no "clear indication" that "An Object Lesson" was

intended to become a Proposal. Common sense tells us that a message

like this, hidden in a large body of unrelated text, is anything but

a "clear indication", regardless of what the message itself says.


Since "An Object Lesson" never became a Proposal, it could not be

adopted Without Objection, and so Rule 1883 remains unrepealed.

==========================================================================
Judge's arguments:

I hereby judge CFJ 1124 to be TRUE.

Reasons:

Had "publically" and "privately" been capitalized in paragraph (d)(3) of rule 
1764, they would have been obviously referring to the conditions set in the 
previous two paragraphs. Though they are not capitalized, it still seems 
reasonable that the definitions of Publically and Privately in the rule. Votes 
sent to agora-discussion do not meet either criterium, and thus are not valid.

==========================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

Rule 1764, "Modes of Voting", says in part:

      (d)  (1) If the mode of voting is Public, then any other Rule to
               the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of any votes,
               or the declaration of Presence, by Voting Entities on
               that Proposal, Election or Referendum, may only be
               achieved by sending a message to the Public Forum.

           (2) If the mode of voting is Private, then any other Rule
               to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of any
               votes, or the declaration of Presence, by Voting
               Entities on that Proposal, Election or Referendum, may
               only be achieved by sending a message privately to the
               Vote Collector.

           (3) If the mode of voting is Unrestricted, then any other
               Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
               any votes, or the declaration of Presence, by Voting
               Entities on that Proposal, Election or Referendum, may
               be achieved by sending a message either publically or
               privately.

The truth of the statement hinges on the interpretation of the words
"publically" and "privately" in the previous paragraph. I argue that
the preceding two paragraphs define the meanings of these words, albeit
indirectly, by defining the meaning of "Public" and "Private" voting.

>From the definition of Public voting, from paragraph (d)(1) a vote
can only by made "publically", if it is sent to the Public Forum.
It is well established that the agora-discussion mailing list is NOT
a Public Forum. So votes sent to this list are not "sent publically".

The definition of Private voting is less unambiguous, but states that
a vote must be "sent privately to the Vote Collector". The term "sent
privately" is not well-defined, but a common sense interpretation rules
out agora-discussion as a private means of communication.

Therefore, votes sent to agora-discussion are neither "sent publically"
nor "sent privately", and so, by paragraph (d)(3), are not valid votes
when the mode of voting is Unrestricted.

==========================================================================
Evidence attached by the Caller:

Rule 1764/5 (Power=1)
Modes of Voting

      (a) There are three possible modes of voting on Proposals,
          Elections and Referenda: Public, Private and Unrestricted.
          The prevailing mode for each of each of Proposals, Elections
          and Referenda is initially Public.

      (b)  (1) The Assessor may change the prevailing mode of voting
               for Proposals, with Support.

           (2) The Registrar may change the prevailing mode of
               voting for Elections, with Support.

           (3) The prevailing mode of Referenda is always Public.

      (c) When the Voting Period on a Proposal, Election or Referendum
          begins, the mode of voting for that Proposal, Election or
          Referendum is set to the prevailing mode for that kind of
          vote.  Once set in this manner, the mode of voting cannot be
          changed.

      (d)  (1) If the mode of voting is Public, then any other Rule to
               the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of any votes,
               or the declaration of Presence, by Voting Entities on
               that Proposal, Election or Referendum, may only be
               achieved by sending a message to the Public Forum.

           (2) If the mode of voting is Private, then any other Rule
               to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of any
               votes, or the declaration of Presence, by Voting
               Entities on that Proposal, Election or Referendum, may
               only be achieved by sending a message privately to the
               Vote Collector.

           (3) If the mode of voting is Unrestricted, then any other
               Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
               any votes, or the declaration of Presence, by Voting
               Entities on that Proposal, Election or Referendum, may
               be achieved by sending a message either publically or
               privately.

Rule 478/10 (Power=1)
The Public Forum

      Whether a given medium is a Public Forum or not is a Nomic
      Property.  The Registrar is authorized to change whether a given
      medium is a Public Forum or not Without Objection.  When such
      a change is made, in order to be effective, the message
      announcing the change must be sent to both a medium that was a
      Public Forum before the change, and a medium that is a Public
      Forum after the change.  (If a single medium is a Public Forum
      both before and after the change, a single message to that
      medium satisfies this requirement.)

      It is the responsibility of each Active Player to ensure that e
      is able to receive messages sent to every medium which the
      Registrar has designated as a Public Forum.  The temporary
      inability of a Player to receive a Public Forum does not deprive
      that medium of any legal significance as a Public Forum.

      Sending a message, by any medium or combination of media, to
      every Active Player, is equivalent to sending it to the Public
      Forum, provided that the message bears a clear indication that
      it is intended to be a message to the Public Forum, and it is
      verifiable that the message was in fact sent to every Active
      Player.

      Whenever the Rules call upon some Player to "announce", "post",
      or "distribute" some communication or notification, this shall
      be accomplished by posting the communication or notification to
      the Public Forum, unless another rule specifies otherwise.

I will be sending out the P-Note and Proposal Queue reports later
today.  I won't be making a proposal distribution until Thursday at
the earliest (which is when I'll be back from a quick trip to
Glasgow).  As I'm new to this job, I'd appreciate a good scrutiny of
the two reports for errors.

Thanks,
Michael.

Text of Proposals in Queue (not a distribution)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
201. Proposal by Murphy, AI=1
The Spiraling Cost of Voting

Create a new Rule titled "The Voting Factor" with this text:

      The Voting Factor is a real number between 0.1 and 10
      inclusive.  Unless the Rules give it another value, the
      Voting Factor is 1.

      The Assessor may change the value of the Voting Factor by
      announcing the new value in the Public Forum, provided that
      e announces a value within the range proscribed above, that
      e makes the announcement prior to midnight GMT Thursday, and
      that e has not already made such an announcement earlier in
      the Week. The new value of the Voting Factor does not take
      effect until the beginning of the Nomic Week after the
      change has been announced.

Amend Rule 1442 (The Cost of Voting) to read:

      Votes on Proposals have a voting cost, based on the Voting
      Tariff and Voting Factor at the time they were distributed.
      If either of these had no value set at that time, then they
      are deemed to have been 1 VT and 1, respectively.

      The voting cost of an entity's first vote on a Proposal is
      equal to the Voting Tariff.  The voting cost of each additional
      vote by that entity on that Proposal is equal to the previous
      vote's cost multiplied by the Voting Factor, then rounded up to
      the nearest multiple of the MUQ of VTs.

      As soon as possible after the end of the Voting Period of a
      given Proposal, the Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity a
      number of Voting Tokens equal to the total cost of the votes
      cast on that Proposal by that entity.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
200. Proposal by Vlad, AI=1
Taking out the Trash

Create a Rule Entitled "Taking Out the Trash" with the following
text:

(with apologies to Mr. Jefferson)

Let it be known that Steve Gardner has behaved in a Hypocritical and
Dishonorable manner. To prove this, let the following Facts be
submitted to a candid World:

WHEREAS: Steve Gardner has, by impersonating another individual,
attempted to subvert the Good Faith basis of communications which is
the backbone of Agora...

WHEREAS: Steve Gardner has consistently opposed legislation that would
make it easier for the Sovereign Will of the Players to be expressed
by the Rules governing them, a right inestimable to them, and
formidable to Tyrants only...

WHEREAS: Steve Gardner has manipulated the Rules, not merely for
personal gain, which would accord with the Traditions of our Fair
Society, but to overthrow Legislation duly approved by the Players,
and replace it with other Legislation which had already been rejected
by those same Players...

WHEREAS: While protesting for the preservation of our traditional
System of Governance, and opposing recent Innovations, He has not
hesitated to employ those Innovations, when it suits him, to overthrow
decisions made in the Traditional Manner he claims to honor, thus
proving himself a Hypocrite and a Knave...

Let It Be Hereby Decided, that Steve Gardner shall be immediately
Deregistered from Agora, and shall be banned from Reregistration for a
period of six months. At the end of that period, this Rule shall
repeal itself, and his Crimes shall be forgiven.

----------------------------------------------------------------------


140. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=2
Unlimited Voting

Be it resolved, that Rule 206 be amended to read:

      (a) A Voting Entity is an Entity which is generally authorized
          by the Rules to cast a vote or votes on a Proposal.  Other
          Rules may withdraw this authorization from a Voting Entity
          in specific circumstances without that Entity thereby
          ceasing to be a Voting Entity.  Only those Entities
          designated by the Rules to be Voting Entities are Voting
          Entities.

      (b) No Entity is permitted to vote on a Proposal unless it is a
          Voting Entity.

      (c) Players and Groups are Voting Entities.

      (d) Unless otherwise specified, each Voting Entity may cast an
          unlimited number of Votes on a Proposal.

Be it further resolved, that Rules 1660, 1765 and 1465 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1442 be amended, by appending a
paragraph reading, "If the voting cost for a Proposal is zero, then
each Voting Entity may cast only one Vote on that Proposal."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

141. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Categorical Redundance?

Be it resolved, that Rules 1048 and 1691 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 1, to read:

      (a) A new Rule shall be assigned to:
        (1) the Rule Category specified by the Instrument that created
            the Rule, if that Rule Category exists; otherwise
        (2) a Rule Category chosen by the Rulekeepor at eir
            discretion, by Public Forum Announcement.

      (b) The Rulekeepor may create a new Rule Category at eir
          discretion, by Public Forum Announcement.

      (c) The Rulekeepor may delete an empty Rule Category at eir
          discretion, by Public Forum Announcement.

      (d) The Rulekeepor may change the name of a Rule Category
          Without Objection.

      (e) The Rulekeepor may change the Rule Category to which a given
          Rule is assigned Without Objection.

[ Comment: Rules 1691 and 1048 are somewhat redundant in their present
  form.  This proto seeks to eliminate the redundancy and clean up
  things a bit. ]


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

142. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Merit

Be it resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Each Player has a Merit Rating, an integer, which may be
          positive, negative, or zero.  Until the Rules act to give a
          Player some other Merit Rating, a Player's Merit Rating is
          zero.  Merit Ratings shall be changed only when authorized
          by the Rules.

      (b) The Office of the Secretary is hereby established.
        (1) The Secretary shall maintain a record of the Merit Rating
            of every Player.
        (2) The Secretary's Report shall include:
          (A) a schedule setting forth the Merit Rating of each
              Player; and
          (B) a description of all changes made to the Merit Rating of
              any Player since the last such Report.
        (3) The Secretary shall receive a salary equal to one and
            one-half times the Basic Officer Salary.

      (c) When an entitlement is to be randomly distributed to the
          Players, the Officer making the distribution shall use the
          following procedure (or any other procedure which results in
          each Player having the same probability of receiving the
          entitlement as e would under the following procedure):
        (1) The Officer shall, for each Player, place in a bin one
            hundred tokens bearing the name of that Player, in each
            case augmenting or diminishing that number by that
            Player's Merit Rating.  (If a Player's Merit Rating is
            less than negative one hundred, then no tokens are placed
            in the bin.)
        (2) The Officer shall then draw one token from the bin, and
            award the entitlement to the Player whose name is on the
            token.

      (d) When making a distribution the procedure described in
          subdivision (c), the Officer shall use the Merit Ratings of
          the Players reported in the most recent uncontested
          Secretary's Report, and no other.  A distribution made based
          on Merit Ratings as required by this subdivision is valid
          notwithstanding any error in the Secretary's Report which
          may later become apparent.
        (1) If the most recent uncontested Secretary's Report is more
            than twenty-one days old, the Officer may elect to delay
            the distribution until a new Report is made.  If the
            Officer elects to delay a distribution, e must announce in
            the Public Forum that e has elected to do so.
        (2) If there has never been an uncontested Secretary's Report,
            the Officer shall proceed on the assumption that every
            Player has a Merit Rating of zero.

143. Proposal by Peekee, AI=1
The Scam? What Scam?

Create a rule with the title "Scam proposals" with the following text.


Let there be a type of proposal know as a Scam Proposal.
A proposal becomes a scam proposal if and only if:

(1) The Proposal contains (or contained) in its title the words "The
Scam".
(2) The Proposal has been adopted.
(3) The Proposal was voted upon after the 15th of March 1999

As soon as possible after a proposal becomes a Scam Proposal the
registrar shall pay out 1 P-Note and a number of Voting Tokens, to any
player who cast a valid vote of "ABSTAIN" on the proposal.  In this case
the number of voting tokens paid out by the registrar to each player
will be the number of votes they cast on the proposal multiplied by the
voting tariff at the time of the proposal being adopted.

This rule will repeal itself one week after it is created.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

145. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Cooperation is a Good Thing

Be it resolved, that Rule 1771 be amended, by replacing the paragraph
reading

      The Priority of the Proposal is increased or decreased, as
      specified by the Player making the payment, by an amount equal
      to the number of P-Notes transferred to the Bank, provided that
      this transfer is not executed for any other purpose.

with one reading

      The Priority of the Proposal is increased or decreased, as
      specified by the Player making the payment, by:
      (a) an amount equal to one-half the number of P-Notes
          transferred to the Bank, if the transferor was the Proposer
          of that Proposal, or
      (b) an amount equal to the number of P-Notes transferred to the
          Bank, otherwise;
      provided that this transfer is not executed for any other
      purpose.

[ This gives Players an incentive to get other people to pay to
  advance their Proposals in the Proposal Queue. ]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1701 be amended, by replacing "The
MUQ of P-Notes is 0.1." with "The MUQ of P-Notes is 0.01."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

147. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Let the Promotor Exercise
Judgment

Be it resolved, that Rule 1483 be amended to read:

      (a) A Proposal is any document clearly marked as such.

      (b) A Proposal is Proposed when it is posted by a Proposing
          Entity to the Public Forum with the clear indication that it
          is being posted for the purpose of Proposing it.

      (c) A Proposal is not Proposed if, in the Promotor's judgment,
          it is substantially identical to another Proposal Proposed
          within the past three weeks, unless
        (1) the Proposing Entity posting the Proposal clearly
            indicates at the time of posting that the Proposal is
            intended to become a duplicate of the prior Proposal, or
        (2) the prior Proposal has been discarded or withdrawn, or has
            been distributed and the results of voting upon that
            Proposal have been announced by the Assessor.

      (d) The Promotor's determination that a Proposal has or has not
          been Proposed (including a determination made under
          subdivision (c) of this Rule) is subject to judicial review
          only for abuse of discretion.

      (e) Under no circumstance shall the Promotor's distribution of
          previously undistributed Proposals constitute the submission
          of a new Proposal.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Any CFJ which alleges that an Officer made an error
          regarding a determination of fact where the Rules state that
          such determinations shall be subject to judicial review only
          for abuse of discretion lacks standing and shall be
          dismissed.  (Such CFJs, to have standing, must allege that
          the Officer in question abused discretion in making the
          disputed determination.)

      (b) This Rule takes precedence over all other Rules pertaining
          to when a CFJ has standing, and over all other Rules which
          specify when a CFJ shall be dismissed.

148. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Standards of Proof

Be it resolved, that Rule 1575 be amended to read:

      (a) A CFJ alleging that a Player has violated a Rule or
          committed a Crime shall not be judged TRUE unless the
          evidence is sufficient to be certain of that Judgement
          beyond reasonable doubt.

      (b) In all other CFJs, the Judgement shall be consistent with
          the preponderance of the evidence at hand.

      (c) Furthermore, it is a complete defense to any accusation of a
          Crime that the Player accused, at the time e performed or
          neglected to perform the actions which constitute the Crime
          accused, reasonably believed that the circumstances were
          such that e was legally permitted to perform or neglect to
          perform those acts.  No Player shall be convicted of a Crime
          if this defense applies.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

150. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=2
Judicial Reform of 1998

Be it resolved, that Rule 991 be amended to read:

      (a) Any person who believes that the Rules have not been
          followed in any way may submit a Call for Judgement (CFJ) to
          rectify the violation. A person who submits a CFJ is known
          as its Caller.

      (b) A CFJ shall identify the Player or Players (Respondents) who
          have failed to follow the Rules, and shall contain a short
          statement of the facts which surround the alleged violation
          of the Rules, a statement of the relief which the Caller is
          seeking, and an argument explaining the legal basis for the
          relief to be sought. The Caller may include any other
          material or information e feels is pertinent.

      (c) Upon the receipt of a CFJ, the Clerk of the Courts shall:
        (1) assign, according to the procedures defined elsewhere, a
            Player to shall serve as the Judge of that CFJ; and
        (2) publish a Notice of Call for Judgement, which shall
            include everything submitted in the CFJ by the Caller and
            the identity of the Player selected under subdivision
            (c)(1) above.

      (d) The Clerk of the Courts shall develop and utilize a system
          of numbering or otherwise identifying CFJs such that Players
          may readily and unambiguously refer to any individual CFJ
          without undue difficulty or confusion.

Be it further resolved, that Rules 897, 1562 and 1563 be repealed.

Cleanup of 1688

Be it resolved, that Rule 1688 be amended to read:

      (a) There shall exist a property of entities known as Power. The
          Power of an entity is an Index, as described elsewhere.

      (c) The Power of any given entity is zero until and unless it is
          set to another value in accordance with the Rules.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

152. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Clear the Slate

Be it resolved, that Rules 1730, 1713, 1732, 1734, 1852, 1735, 1853,
1637, 1817, 1818, 1873, 1738, 1739, 1757, 1479, 1596, 1696, 1759,
1598, 1599, 1601, 1701, 1820, 1821, 1822, 1823, 1714, 1824, 1785 and
1435 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) When the Rules refer to a class of entities as a
          "commodity", this means that that class of entities has
          certain properties as described herein.

      (b) Instances of a commodity may be created, destroyed,
          appropriated, abandoned, or transferred only in such manner
          and in such circumstances as the Rules permit. When
          permitted, creation, destruction, appropriation,
          abandonment, or transfer shall be effected by Public Forum
          announcement, or by whatever other method the Rules
          establish in the circumstance.

      (c) Instances of a transferrable commodity may be transferred by
          their possessor to any other entity capable of possessing
          commodities, except when the Rules specifically prohibit
          such transfer. Nontransferrable commodities may be
          transferred only when the Rules specifically so allow.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Indulgences are a transferrable commodity.
        (1) The possessor of an Indulgence may use that Indulgence to
            cancel any one Blot in eir possession, by Public Forum
            Announcement. Doing so destroys both the Blot and the
            Indulgence.
        (2) The Herald shall maintain the records of Indulgence
            ownership.

      (b) Blots are a nontransferrable commodity.
        (1) The possessor of a Blot may destroy that Blot by
            cancelling it with an Indulgence in accordance with
            subdivision (a)(1) of this Rule.
        (2) When the Rules state that a Player is to gain some number
            of Blots, the Herald shall create that number of Blots and
            transfer them to that Player's possession.
        (3) The Herald shall maintain the records of Blot ownership.
        (4) A Player who possesses no Blots may be said to be
            Immaculate.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) A Lawless Player is a Player who possesses more than 30
          Blots.

      (b) Whenever a Player correctly alleges in the Public Forum that
          another Player is Lawless, the Lawless Player is removed
          from any Offices e holds, is deregistered, and is barred
          from reregistering for a period of one month..

      (d) If the Lawless Player was the Speaker, the Speaker-Elect
          first immediately becomes Speaker, and the old Speaker
          ceases to be Speaker.

      (f) To incorrectly allege in the Public Forum that a Player is
          Lawless is the Crime of Persecution, a Class A Crime.

      (h) This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would
          prohibit a Lawless Player from being deregistered.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1670 be amended to read:

      There is a Patent Title of Distributor. It shall be possessed by
      that person most responsible for the maintenance of the Public
      Forum, as designated by the Registrar. It shall be awarded
      without need for a proposal when the Registrar identifies this
      person in the Public Forum. The title shall be removed whenever
      the Registrar designates a new Distributor.

      If the Distributor is a Player, the Registrar shall, as soon as
      possible after the beginning of each month, pay out to the
      Distributor Voting Tokens equivalent to the Basic Officer
      Salary, in recognition of eir service.

      The Registrar is obliged to keep the Distributor informed of the
      e-mail addresses of all Players, as well as to inform the
      Distributor of any address change as soon as possible after e
      learns of it.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1771 be amended to read:

      An Player may increase or decrease the Priority of a Proposal in
      the Queue by announcing to the Public Forum that e does so, and
      paying a number of P-Notes to the Bank. For each P-Note e pays
      to the Bank, the Priority of the Proposal is increased or
      decreased by one as specified by the Player making the payment,
      provided that this transfer is not executed for any other
      purpose.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1439 be amended to read:

      If a Call For Judgement (CFJ) clearly alleging that a Player has
      violated a specific Rule is found to be TRUE, the Player
      receives Blots equal to the Power of the violated Rule rounded
      down to the nearest whole integer, or four Blots if its Power
      exceeds four. This Rule defers to the wording of the violated
      Rule when it defines a Blot penalty in the specific case of a
      CFJ, or specifically forbids Blot penalties in the case of a
      CFJ.

      The Player who initially called for the CFJ shall make the
      Payment Orders necessary to apply the Blots.

      If such a Judgement is overturned upon appeal, then the Player
      who received Blots shall vacate the Blots that were given due to
      the initial Judgement of the CFJ.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1377 be amended to read:

      There is an Office of Herald.

      The Herald's Report includes the following:

      (a) The Honour of every Entity that has been a Player at any
          time within the last three months, and the changes thereof
          since the last posting of the Herald's Report.

      (b) The reason for each such change; in the case of a
          Player-initiated change this includes any justification
          provided by the Player.

      (c) The Currency Records for Indulgences.

      (d) A list of all Fugitives from Justice, and the number of
          Fugitive Blots attributed to each such Fugitive.

      The Herald shall receive a salary equal to 2 times the Basic
      Officer Salary.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1854 be amended to read:

      The Chancellor can set the level of the Basic Officer Salary by
      announcing in the Public Forum that e is doing so, provided that
      e announces a value between 0 VTs and 8 VTs inclusive, that e
      makes the announcement before the 25th day of the month, and
      that the Basic Officer Salary has not already been set by a
      similar such announcement earlier in the month.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1677 be amended to read:

      As soon as possible after the start of a Player's Grace Period,
      the Registrar shall pay out 5 Voting Tokens and 1 P-Note to that
      Player.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1678 be amended to read:

      If an Interested Proposal passes, and that Proposal was
      submitted by a Player within that Player's Grace Period, then
      the Assessor shall pay out to that Player an award of 3 Voting
      Tokens, over and above any other award that Player might also
      receive for that Proposal. This Rule takes precedence over Rules
      that would prevent this award.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 502 be amended to read:

      The Clerk of the Courts shall, within one week of the time a
      Player earns a Judicial Salary, pay out that Judicial Salary to
      that Player.

      If a decision (or dismissal) which resulted in a Player earning
      a Judicial Salary is subsequently appealed and overturned on
      appeal, the Clerk of the Courts shall vacate the Payment Order
      paying the salary originally received for that decision.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1799 be amended to read:

      Any Order may always be amended, stayed, or vacated by the
      Player (or, in the case of Appellate Orders, Board of Appeal)
      who executed it. Certain classes of Orders may be amended,
      stayed, or vacated in other circumstances as well, when the
      Rules so allow. In all cases, this is done by an Order to Amend,
      Stay, or Vacate, respectively, the original Order.

      Otherwise, an Order shall not be amended, stayed, vacated, or
      otherwise changed once executed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 408 be amended to read:

      The Player assigned to Judge a Call for Judgement is required to
      either return a Judgement upon that CFJ or dismiss that CFJ
      within the assigned deliberation period, which ends seven days
      after e is assigned to Judge it.

      Failure to do so is the Infraction of Judging Late, detected and
      reported by the CotC. At the time of the report of the
      Infraction, if the CFJ has been Judged or dismissed then the
      penalty is 1 VT and the Judgement or dismissal is legal even
      though delivered late. Otherwise the penalty is 3 Blots, and the
      Judge becomes ineligible to Judge that CFJ, and a new Judge
      shall be assigned in the usual manner.

      A Judge who has neither judged nor dismissed a CFJ within seven
      days after the end of the assigned deliberation period becomes
      ineligible to Judge that CFJ, and any Judgement or Dismissal
      submitted after this time is not legal and shall not be accepted
      by the CotC.

      However, if the Player assigned to Judge a CFJ ceases to be
      eligible before judging or dismissing that CFJ, then e is
      neither required nor permitted to either return a Judgement on,
      or dismiss, that CFJ, and ceases to be the Judge assigned to
      that CFJ at the moment e becomes ineligible.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 681 be amended to read:

      If the Speaker announces in the Public Forum that e is giving up
      the Speakership voluntarily, a Speaker Transition occurs.

      As soon as possible after the Transition is completed, the new
      Speaker shall bill the former Speaker one Voting Token.

      When a Speaker voluntarily gives up the Speakership in this
      manner, e is prevented from nominating emself for the Office of
      Speaker-Elect for a period lasting two weeks, or until the start
      of the next quarter, whichever is longest.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 947 be amended to read:

      If a Proposal is adopted which, as part or all of its effect,
      repeals one or more Rules, and immediately prior to the adoption
      of this Proposal there were more than 100 Rules, the Rulekeepor
      shall pay out 1 P-Note to the Proposer of that Proposal.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1007 be amended to read:

      At the beginning of each month, the Registrar shall pay out to
      each Player the designated Salary for each Office that Player
      has held for a total of at least 12 days in the preceding month.

      There is a Basic Officer Salary, equal to a number of Voting
      Tokens, the level of which is set by the Chancellor, as
      described in other Rules. Salaries are permitted to be expressed
      in terms of the Basic Salary. Unless otherwise specified, the
      Salary for an Office shall be equal to the Basic Salary.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1505 be amended to read:

      The following Classes of Crime are defined, with the listed
      penalties:

      Class A Crime: The Player receives 20 Blots and loses 20 VTs.

      Class B Crime: The Player receives 10 Blots and loses 10 VTs.

      Class C Crime: The Player receives 4 Blots and loses 4 VTs.

      Class D Crime: The Player receives 2 Blots and loses 2 VTs.

      Class E Crime: The Player receives 1 Blot and loses 1 VT.

      Class 1 Crime: The Player receives 1 Blot.

      Class 2 Crime: The Player receives 2 Blots.

      Class 3 Crime: The Player receives 3 Blots.

      Class 4 Crime: The Player receives 4 Blots.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1442 be amended to read:

      Proposals have a voting cost, equal to the Voting Tariff at the
      time they were distributed. If there was no value set for the
      Voting Tariff at that time, then the voting cost is 1 VT.

      As soon as possible after the end of the Voting Period of a
      given Proposal, the Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity a
      number of Voting Tokens equal to the votes cast on that Proposal
      by that entity multiplied by the voting cost for that Proposal.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1723 be amended to read:

      A Proposal is Sane if all the following conditions are met:

      (a) the text of the message wherein it is submitted explicitly
          states that it is a Sane Proposal,

      (b) The Proposal is Interested,

      (c) The Proposer has paid 2 P-Notes to the Bank, expressly for
          this purpose (and not for any other). In order for this
          payment to have effect, it must be made before the Proposal
          is distributed.

      Players may cast no more than one vote on a Sane Proposal.
      Non-Player Voting Entities may not vote on Sane Proposals.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would allow
      non-Player Voting Entities to vote on Sane Proposals, or which
      would allow Players to cast more than one vote on a Sane
      Proposal.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1724 be amended to read:

      A Proposal is Urgent if all the following conditions are met:

      (a) the text of the message wherein it is submitted explicitly
          states that it is an Urgent Proposal,

      (b) The Proposal is Interested,

      (c) The Proposer has paid 1 P-Note to the Bank, expressly for
          this purpose (and not for any other). In order for this
          payment to have effect, it must be made before the Proposal
          is distributed.

      The Voting Period of an Urgent Proposal is five days.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would specify the
      Voting Period for Urgent Proposals.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1562 be amended to read:

      The Clerk of the Courts shall dismiss without prejudice any CFJ
      made by a Player who has previously made five or more CFJs
      during that Nomic Week. Such a CFJ is called an "excess CFJ".
      The Player who submits an excess CFJ commits the Infraction of
      Excess CFJing, to be reported by the Clerk of the Courts and
      bearing a penalty of 0.5 VT.

      If the Clerk of the Courts fails to dismiss an excess CFJ, and
      instead assigns it to a Judge, then the CFJ shall not be
      dismissed for being an excess CFJ and shall be Judged (or
      dismissed) exactly as any other CFJ. Failing to dismiss an
      excess CFJ is the Infraction of Allowing Excess CFJing, to be
      reported by the Justiciar, and bearing a penalty of 0.5 VT and
      two Blots.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1742 be amended to read:

      If two (or more) Players enter into an agreement, but one (or
      more) of these Players then fails to comply with that agreement,
      any other Player party to that agreement may make a CFJ alleging
      that that agreement has been broken.

      If the Judge of such a CFJ finds that the agreement has in fact
      been broken, e is permitted to issue Orders binding upon any or
      all of the parties of the broken agreement so as to effect fair
      and appropriate restitution for its breach. When restitution
      would involve the transfer of Currencies, the Judge is
      authorized to execute whatever Payment Orders are necessary to
      effect fair and appropriate restitution.

      The above notwithstanding, no restitution shall be available
      with respect to the breach of the agreement which would have
      required a Player to break the Rules, nor shall restitution
      include the execution of Payment Orders, the payor of which is
      any entity not party to the agreement.

      Nothing in this Rule shall be construed so as to impair the
      enforcement of an agreement which requires a Player to violate
      another agreement.

      A CFJ alleging that an agreement has been broken called by
      anyone who is not party to that agreement lacks standing and
      shall be dismissed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1661 be amended to read:

      A Speaker who is not Tainted has the Right of Patronage. This
      Right is the authority to, once a week, order the award of
      specific currencies from the Bank to specific Players, only as
      specified in this Rule.

      The Speaker exercises this right by posting to the Public Forum
      a Payment Order from the Bank to one Player for not more than 1
      unit of any one Currency Minted by the Bank. The Player to
      receive the award must not have received a Patronage award
      within the preceding four weeks, and the Speaker must provide a
      reason along with the Payment Order.

      Such awards are only permitted to recognize acts the Speaker
      believes to be of benefit to the Agora community, acts that the
      Speaker believes to exceed the call of duty, or acts that the
      Speaker believes to be of extreme sacrifice for the good of the
      Game.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1662 be amended to read:

      After the end of every month, if the same Player was Speaker for
      that entire month, the Registrar shall pay out a Speaker's
      Gratuity of two VTs to the Speaker.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1447 be amended to read:

      Once a Board of Appeals has been selected to decide a particular
      appeal, the Justices shall, collectively, consider the question.

      Each Justice has seven days, from the point e becomes Justice on
      a particular Board, in which to reach a determination that
      either sustains or overturns the matter being considered by that
      Board and submit it to the CotC.

      Failure to do so is the Infraction of Failing to Judge an
      Appeal, detected and reported by the CotC, bearing a penalty of
      3 Blots, which results in that Justice's dismissal as a Justice
      from that Board. In this case the CotC must randomly select an
      eligible Player to replace em.

      After all three Justices have submitted their determinations to
      the CotC, the CotC shall post these determinations in the Public
      Forum along with any arguments, evidence, or other material
      included with those determinations.

      If a majority of the Justices agree to sustain the matter being
      considered, it is sustained; otherwise, it is overturned. The
      specific results of overturning a matter upon appeal are
      determined by the Rules permitting such appeals.

      Each Justice who submits eir determination to the CotC before
      the end of the assigned deliberation period shall receive a
      Judicial Salary of 1 VT upon the publication of eir
      determination.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1465 be amended to read:

      At the start of the first Nomic Week after the legal and correct
      announcement that a Player has won a Game, that Player shall
      receive a Champion's Reward. The Champion's Reward shall last
      for four Nomic weeks from that time, and is then withdrawn from
      that Player. As soon as possible after the legal and correct
      announcement that a Player has won a Game, the Registrar shall
      pay out four Voting Tokens to that Player.

      Any Player who has been awarded a Champion's Reward that has not
      yet been withdrawn, has the right to cast three votes on any
      Proposal.

      The Registrar shall maintain a list of all Champion's Rewards
      which have been granted and have not yet been withdrawn,
      including to whom they have been granted, and their times of
      commencement and conclusion. This list is known as the Green
      Pages, and is part of the Registrar's Report.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1862 be amended to read:

      The Voting Tariff is a number of VTs, a multiple of the MUQ,
      between 0 and 2 inclusive. Unless the Rules give it another
      value, the Voting Tariff is 1 VT.

      The Assessor may change the value of the Voting Tariff by
      announcing the new value in the Public Forum, provided that e
      announces a value within the range proscribed above, that e
      makes the announcement prior to midnight GMT Thursday, and that
      e has not already made such an announcement earlier in the Week.
      The new value of the Voting Tariff does not take effect until
      the beginning of the Nomic Week after the change has been
      announced.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1565 be amended to read:

      A Judge must dismiss a CFJ if one of the following is true of
      it:

      (a) It contains no clearly-identifiable Statement.

      (b) Its Statement can not logically admit to either being TRUE
          or FALSE.

      (c) Its Statement does not relate to a matter relevant to the
          Rules.

      (d) Its Statement fails to comply with the Rules.

      (e) It lacks standing, as defined elsewhere.

      (f) After a reasonable effort by the Judge to obtain all
          relevant information, no determination can be made of the
          truth or falsity of its Statement.

      The Judge does this by notifying the CotC of the CFJ's
      dismissal, and the reasons e is doing so. Dismissals are only
      legal when made for the reasons listed in this Rule. Dismissal
      occurs when the CotC is notified of a legal dismissal.

      As soon as possible after being notified of a legal dismissal,
      the CotC must post to the Public Forum a notice of the dismissal
      and the Judge's reasons for doing so.

      If the dismissal, upon appeal, is subsequently set aside, then
      that CFJ is no longer dismissed. It shall be considered again
      and can not again be legally dismissed for the same reasons.

      A Judge who dismisses a CFJ before the end of the assigned
      deliberation period shall receive a Judicial Salary of 1 VT.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1664 be amended to read:

      Any Player is either Abiding or Rebellious. A new Player is
      always Abiding when e becomes a player. A Player can switch from
      Abiding to Rebellious or from Rebellious to Abiding by sending a
      message to the Public Forum saying e does change so. The
      Registrar shall maintain a list of all Players that are
      Rebellious. This list is known as the Red Pages, and is part of
      the Registrar's Report.

      A Player may Call for a Revolt at any time, by sending to the
      Public Forum saying e does so. A Call for Revolt is only
      effective if the following conditions are met:

      (a) The player posting the Call is Rebellious,

      (b) No other effective Call for Revolt has been made that week,

      (c) A successful Revolt has not occured for a month or more.

      As soon as possible after an effective Call for Revolt has been
      posted, the Registrar must determine whether the Revolt
      succeeds, as outlined below, and post the result to the Public
      Forum.

      The result of a Revolt is determined as follows: The Registrar
      selects a random integer from 1 to the number of Players at the
      time of the Call for Revolt. If this number is less than or
      equal to the number of Rebellious Players at the time of the
      Call for Revolt, then the Revolt succeeds, otherwise it fails.

      If a Revolt succeeds, then the following events occur (in
      order):

      (a) The Registrar shall vacate all Blots of each Rebellious
          Player.

      (b) The Registrar shall pay out 2 VTs to each Rebellious Player.

      (c) The Registrar is empowered and required to levy a tax of 75%
          on indulgences. The holder of the Patent Title "Robespierre"
          is exempt from this tax, even if other rules don't allow tax
          exemptions.

      (d) A Speaker Transition occurs

      (e) All Players that hold one or more Offices in the normal
          fashion cease to hold those in a normal fashion and hold
          them temporarily instead.

      (f) All Rebellious Players become Abiding again

      If a Revolt does not succeed, then:

      (a) All Rebellious Players gain 2 Blots.

      (b) The Player who Called for Revolt gains 2 (additional) Blots

      The Registrar shall execute all Payment Orders required by this
      rule.

      The Registrar is authorised to vacate any payment orders this
      rule requires em to vacate.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1449 be amended to read:

      There shall exist the Office of Assessor. The Assessor shall
      receive a salary equal to 0.5 times the Basic Officer Salary.

      The Assessor shall also receive a Commission. At the end of the
      Voting Period for a Proposal, the Assessor shall pay out to
      emself an amount equal to 5% of the VTs spent on voting on that
      Proposal.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1567 be amended to read:

      A Player makes emself ineligible to be the Judge of a specific
      CFJ by transmitting a notice to the Clerk of the Courts,
      specifying the CFJ for which e wishes to be made ineligible.

      If, at the time a Player makes emself ineligible to be a Judge
      of a CFJ in this manner, e has already been selected as the
      Judge of that CFJ, the Clerk of the Courts shall bill that
      Player a fee of 0.5 VT and shall recuse that Player as the Judge
      of that CFJ.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1747 be amended to read:

      The Clerk of the Courts has the power to Pardon Lawless Players.
      The Clerk may not exercise this power more than once per Nomic
      month, and may not Pardon the same Player twice in a given term
      of office (although, if re-elected later, e may again Pardon
      that Player). The Clerk of the Courts Pardons a Player by
      announcing e is doing so in the Public Forum. Then the following
      events shall occur:

      (a) The Clerk of the Courts shall request the Herald to
          eliminate all Fugitive Blots owned by the Pardoned Player,
          and the Herald shall do so as soon as possible.

      (b) The Clerk of the Courts may, if necessary, vacate any
          Payment Orders for Indulgences possessed by the Pardoned
          Player's estate in order to reduce the number of Blots
          possessed by the Player's estate to below the threshhold for
          Lawlessness. The CotC may not Vacate Payment Orders for X
          number of Indulgences if Vacating PO's for a lesser number
          of Indulgences would suffice to render the Player no longer
          Lawless.

      (c) After the above two actions have been completed, the Player
          may reregister.

      (d) The Pardoned Player shall then post a Formal Apology to the
          Public Forum for eir Lawlessness. The CotC may include a
          list of up to ten Prescribed Words in eir Pardon.

      (e) A Pardoned Player is not subject to Persistent Indebtedness
          penalties for three months after being Pardoned, but during
          this period e must apply all Indulgences received (from any
          source) to eir debt and may not transfer them to another
          Entity.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule governing Lawlessness,
      Fugitive Blots, when a deregistered Player may reregister, or
      Persistent Indebtedness.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1568 be amended to read:

      Any Player who goes on Hold while selected as the Judge of one
      or more CFJs commits the Infraction of Judge Inactivity. This
      Infraction is to be reported by the Clerk of the Courts, and has
      a penalty of 0.5 VT times the number of CFJs for which the
      Player was selected as Judge when e went On Hold.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1786 be amended to read:

      A Proposal is considered to have passed by the narrowest of
      margins when all of the following conditions are true:

      (a) The Proposal has met the requirements established by other
          Rules to be considered passed.

      (b) If there had been 1 (one) less FOR vote (out of the total
          number of FOR votes in the final tally) on this proposal, it
          would not have passed or not met Quorum-- or both.

      (c) There must have been at least 1 (one) AGAINST vote in the
          final tally.

      As soon as possible after a Proposal has been determined to have
      passed by the narrowest of margins, the Assessor shall pay out
      to that Proposal's Proposer an award of 3 (three) Voting Tokens
      in addition to any other award that Player might also receive
      for the passing of that Proposal.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 833 be amended to read:

      As soon as possible after the beginning of the Nomic Week, the
      Assessor shall pay out two Proposal Notes to each Player who
      submitted an Interested Proposal which was adopted during the
      previous Week.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 591 be amended to read:

      A Judge judges a CFJ by sending eir Judgment to the Clerk of the
      Courts. The Judgement of a CFJ must be either TRUE or FALSE.
      Only the Judge assigned to a CFJ may Judge that CFJ.

      As soon as possible after the receipt of a legal Judgement, the
      Clerk shall distribute the Judgement to the Public Forum.

      A Judge who delivers Judgement on a CFJ before the end of the
      assigned deliberation period shall receive a Judicial Salary of
      1 VT.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1727 be amended, by deleting the
paragraph which begins, "BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that, not less than
seven days prior" and by deleting the paragraph which begins, "BE IT
FURTHER RESOLVED that the Chancellor shall," and by deleting the
paragraph which begins, "BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Notary may".

153. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Esthetic Scoring

Be it resolved, that Rules 1729, 1875, 1876, 1877, 1878, 1879 and 1880
be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 1, to read:

      (b) The Grand Agoran Tournament consists of a series of Rounds.
          These Rounds begin on the First of March, June, September,
          and October of each year, and last for three months. The
          first Round begins March 1, 1999.

      (c) At the beginning of each Round, the Scorekeepor will draw up
          a list of all Active Players.
        (1) For the first Round, this list will be in descending order
            of combined P-Note and VT holdings, as taken from the most
            recent Official Reports.
        (3) For subsequent Rounds, this list will be in descending
            order of their Scores from the preceding Round.
        (5) Ties will be broken by random selection.

      (d) The Scorekeepor will then determine the number of Circles
          among which the Active Players will be partitioned. This
          selection shall be the least number such that:
        (1) there is at least one Circle for each six Active Players,
            and
        (2) there are at least three Circles.
          These Circles are designated, in descending order of rank,
          as the First Circle, the Second Circle, and so forth.

      (f) The Scorekeepor shall then assign the Players on eir list to
          the Circles, ensuring that the following conditions are met:
        (1) no Circle shall have more Players assigned to it than any
            other Circle of lower Rank;
        (2) the difference between the number of Players assigned to
            any two Circles shall not exceed one; and
        (3) no Player shall be placed in a Circle of higher rank than
            that of any Player who appeared before em on the
            Scorekeepor's list.

      (g) Except in the first Round, if two or more Players who were
          tied at the end of the previous Round are placed in
          different Circles, the Scorekeepor shall reassign all of
          those Players to the highest Circle to which any of those
          Players was assigned in accordance with subdivision (f) of
          this Rule.

      (h) At the start of each Round, the score of every Player is set
          to zero.

      (i) When a Player registers or comes Off Hold, eir Score is set
          to zero, and e is assigned to the same Circle in which e was
          in when e most recently deregistered or went On Hold (as
          appropriate), if e deregistered or went On Hold during the
          same Round; or the lowest ranking Circle otherwise.

      (j) A Player who goes On Hold is automatically withdrawn from
          the current Round of competition.

      (k) At the end of each Round each Player with the highest Score
          in eir Circle wins that Round for that Circle and receives
          the corresponding Scoring Patent Title.

      (l) Any Player winning eir Circle has the option of not
          participating in the Round immediately following. To
          exercise this option, the Player must post eir wishes to the
          Public Forum within two weeks after the beginning of the
          Round e is opting out of. A Player who opts out in this
          manner is ineligible for SPTs in that Round, and, for the
          purpose of subdivision (c) in the Round following, has a
          Score in that Round equal to that which e had in the
          previous Round.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 1, to read:

      (a) A Team consists of a group of Players who have signed an
          Application to Form a Team within two weeks of the beginning
          of the Round in which they wish to compete.

      (b) A Team's Score is the combined Scores of its members.

      (c) A Team wins the Team Competition if at the end of that Round
          its Score is greater than that of all other registered
          Teams.

      (d) If a Team is formed and persists to the end of the Round
          without being dissolved, the Scorekeepor shall pay out 2 VTs
          to each member of that Team.

      (e) If fewer then two Teams register for a round, there is no
          Team Competition that Round.

      (f) There is a type of Application called an Application to Form
          a Team (AFT). A valid AFT, in order to have effect upon
          Execution, must:
        (1) specify the name of the proposed Team;
        (2) specify the Players who will compose the Team, subject to
            the following:
          (A) there must be at least three Players;
          (B) no two of the Players named may belong to the same
              Circle; and
          (C) none of the Players may belong to an already-existing
              team;
            be signed by all of the Players specified by it as Players
            of the proposed Team; and
        (3) its Sponsor must be one the Players specified as a
            proposed Team member.

      (g) The Sponsor of an AFT will be known as the Team Captain of
          that Team for the duration of the Round.

      (h) A Team is dissolved when:
        (1) it ceases to have as Members at least three Players; or
        (2) the Round ends.

      (i) A valid AFT is Executed by sending it to the Scorekeepor or
          submitting it to the Public Forum.

      (j) The effect of Execution of a valid AFT is the entrance of
          the proposed Team into the current Team Competition.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 1, to read:

      (a) There is an Office of Scorekeepor, whose Salary is 1.5 times
          the Basic Officer Salary, and whose responsibility it is to
          keep accurate track of the current Score of all Players. The
          Scorekeepor's Report consists of the Circles of the current
          Round and the Players in each Circle, the current Scores of
          each Player, the changes in Scores since the last Report and
          the way those points were earned, the Teams entered in the
          current Team Competition, and the current Team Scores of
          each Team. The Scorekeepor is only obliged to keep track of
          scores and post reports if a Round is currently underway.

      (b) The Scorekeepor is also responsible for posting the final
          Scores at the end of each Round, and announcing the SPTs
          awarded to the Players that have fulfilled the conditions
          for receiving them.

      (c) Once per Round, no more than two weeks and no less than one
          week before the end of the Round, the Scorekeepor may act to
          change the Scoring Rule Without 3 Objections. The
          Scorekeepor may only propose changes to the basis of
          Scoring, otherwise the Action automatically fails. If the
          action takes effect, the Scoring Rule is changed
          appropriately at the beginning of the next Round.

      (d) Players receive Points when certain actions are performed by
          them or when certain events occur. This is the only Rule
          which may define the methods of Scoring. In general, a
          Player may receive points only for actions which occur
          during the current Round, although those actions may depend
          on others which occurred previously (thus, for example, a
          Player could gain points for one of eir Proposals passing,
          even if the Proposal was distributed before the beginning of
          the current Round.). Points are non-transferable.

      (e) In general, a Player may receive points for a certain type
          of event any number of times, unless that event has a number
          (N) after it, in which case a given Player may be awarded
          points for that type of event only N times in a given Round.

      (f) If not otherwise noted, Points awarded for events referring
          to "a Player" or "any Player", go to that Player. Bonuses
          are in addition to the basic award. Multipliers are in lieu
          of the basic award. Bonuses can be multiplied.

      (g) Responsibility for detecting changes to a Player's Score
          from the following events is the responsibility of the
          Scorekeepor:
        (1) If a Proposal proposed by a Player passes: 5 points for
            first passing Proposal by that Player in that Round, 3 for
            second, 1 for third, 0.5 for fourth and subsequent
            Proposals, +0.5 if Proposal is a Repeal, +1 if the
            Proposer does not Vote on the Proposal. Double points if
            Proposal passes unanimously. Triple Points if the Player
            making the Proposal is the only Entity who votes AGAINST.
        (2) To any Player winning a contested Election: 8 points.
            Double points if Elected unanimously.
        (3) To any Player holding the most of a given currency at the
            end of a Round: 8 Points per currency. Tripled if at any
            point during the Round a Player had no holdings in that
            Currency.
        (4) To any Player tied for the most of a given currency at the
            end of a Round: 5 Points per currency. Tripled if at any

      (i) Scoring Patent Titles (SPTs) are a subclass of Patent
          Titles. They are identical to Patent Titles except that they
          are automatically revoked at the end of the Round subsequent
          to the one for which they were awarded. The valid SPTs, and
          the circumstances for which they are awarded, are as
          follows:
        (1) For winning an Individual Competition in the Nth Circle, a
            Player receives the SPT of 'Victor of the Nth Circle'
            (where Nth is replaced by the ordinal corresponding to eir
            Circle number). If a Player wins the same Circle two
            Rounds in succession e receives instead the SPT of 'Double
            Victor of the Nth Circle', for three consecutive Rounds
            'Triple Victor of the Nth Circle', etc.
        (2) If two or more Players within a Circle are tied for the
            highest score in a Circle at the end of a Round, they
            receive the SPT of 'Pseudo-Victor of the Nth Circle'
            (where Nth is replaced by the ordinal corresponding to eir
            Circle number).
        (3) For being a member of a Team winning the Team Competition,
            a Player receives the SPT of 'Team Victor', except for the
            Team Captain who receives the SPT of "Victorious Leader"
        (4) If two or more Teams are tied for the highest Team Score
            at the end of a Round, their members receive the SPT of
            'Team Pseudo-Victor'
        (5) If a Player Scores enough in a Round that e would have won
            at least one of the Circles higher than that in which e
            competed, e receives the SPT of 'Overachiever'.
        (6) If a Player Scores so low that e would have placed last in
            at least one of the Circles below eir own e receives the
            SPT of 'Slacker'.

154. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Motions, revisited

Be it resolved, that Rules 789, 1500, 1564, 1826, 1827, 1828 and 1868
be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rules 502, 911, 1365, 1439, 1447, 1457,
1552, 1565, 1570, 1693, 1694, 1695, 1727, 1769, 1794, 1796, 1799,
1804, 1805, 1806, 1807, 1809, 1833 and 1879 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 1, to read:

      (a) The Court of Appeals shall consist of three Justices. These
          shall be the Justiciar, the Clerk of the Courts, and the
          Speaker. In addition, temporary Justices may be selected by
          the Clerk of the Courts.

      (b) Each appeal shall be considered by a panel of three
          Justices.

      (c) Each panel shall initially consist of the three permanent
          Justices.

      (d) A Justice is removed from a panel whenever:
        (1) e steps down;
        (2) e goes On Hold; or
        (3) e ceases to be a Player.

      (e) A Justice must step down from a panel if that Justice:
        (1) was the Judge of the CFJ from which the appeal arises; or
        (2) was ineligible to be selected to serve as the Judge of the
            CFJ from which the appeal arises.
        (3) Further, a Justice may step down from a panel whenever e
            believes it proper to do so. A Justice steps down from a
            specified appeal by notifying the Clerk of the Courts.
        (4) A panel which, for any reasons, consists of fewer than
            three unique Justices shall have a sufficient number of
            temporary Justices added to it so as to give it three
            unique Justices. Temporary Justices shall be selected at
            random by the Clerk of the Courts from amongst all Active
            Players.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 1, to read:

      (a) The Court of Appeals shall have exclusive jurisdiction to
          decide any question regarding:
        (1) the correctness or legality of the Judgement entered by a
            Judge in a Call for Judgement;
        (2) the correctness, appropriateness, or legality of any
            Judicial Order;
        (3) the correctness, appropriateness, or legality of the grant
            or denial of any Judicial Motion; or
        (4) any allegation that a Judge has failed to properly perform
            eir duties as a Judge.

      (b) An appeal shall be initiated to decide any question of the
          sort listed in subdivision (a) of this Rule when requested
          in the Public Forum by: any one Player, if the question
          involves the issuance of an Order which binds that Player;

      (c) any one Player, if the question involves a Judgement which
          convicts that Player of a Crime; or

      (d) any three Players.

      When an appeal is initiated, the Court shall immediately convene
      and collectively decide the question, either in the affirmative
      or the negative, and upon reaching a decision the Court shall
      inform the Clerk of the Courts of its decision and the reasons
      therefore (if any).

      The Court of Appeals shall have the power to execute such
      Judicial Orders as may be necessary to enforce its
      determination, subject to the limitations established in the
      Rules upon Judicial Orders issued by the Court of Appeals.

      The Clerk of the Courts is directed to establish a system of
      nomenclature for certified questions so as to permit easy and
      unambiguous reference to them.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 1, to read:

      (a) A Motion is a formal request made by a Player to a Court.
          This may be either a Common Court or the Court of Appeals.

      (b) A Motion is filed by submitting it to the Clerk of the
          Courts, clearly identifying the CFJ or certified question to
          which the Motion applies, and setting forth the action
          requested.

      (c) The Clerk of the Courts shall forward each properly-filed
          Motion to the Court in question as soon as possible after
          receiving it.

      (d) Within five days (unless the Court defers ruling on the
          motion) the Court shall rule on the Motion, either granting
          or denying it. If a Court fails to rule or defer ruling on a
          Motion within the time alloted by this subdivision, it is
          assumed to have denied it.

      (e) A Court may defer ruling on a Motion by informing the Clerk
          of the Courts that it is doing so, in which case it must
          either grant or deny the Motion not later than it issues a
          decision on the CFJ or certified question with which the
          Motion is associated. A Court may not defer ruling on a
          Motion made after decision has been granted. If the Court
          fails to rule on a deferred Motion by the time it issues a
          decision on the related CFJ or certified question, it is
          assumed to have denied it.

      (f) The effect of granting a Motion depends on the nature of the
          Motion granted, but generally amounts to requiring the Court
          to perform as requested by the Motion. A Motion requesting a
          Judicial Order, if granted, requires that Court to execute
          the Order requested.

      (g) A Court rules on a motion by filing its ruling of grant or
          denial with the Clerk of the Courts, along with any reasons
          it chooses to state.

      (h) Upon receipt of a Court's ruling on a Motion, the Clerk
          shall note the ruling made and the reasons, if any, on the
          record of the CFJ or certified question, and shall notify
          the Player who made the Motion of the ruling.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 1, to read:

      (a) Whenever a Call for Judgement is received by the Clerk of
          the Courts, the Clerk shall convene a new Common Court to
          hear that CFJ, and shall assign a Player to act as the Judge
          of that Court.

      (b) If the Player assigned as the Judge of a Court ceases to be
          eligible to act as the Judge in that Court, and any CFJ
          assigned to that Court is not fully resolved, the Clerk of
          the Courts shall assign a new Player to act as the Judge of
          that Court.

      (c) Once a CFJ is assigned to a Common Court, it shall remain
          assigned to that Court, unless transferred to another Court
          by an Order of Transfer.

      (d) The selection of Players to act as the Judge of a Common
          Court shall be made from amongst all those Players eligible
          to serve as the Judge of that Court.

      (e) Once assigned as the Judge of a Court, that Player remains
          the Judge of that Court until e is recused as Judge of that
          Court, or e ceases to be a Player.

      (f) A CFJ is fully resolved if:
        (1) it has been either judged or dismissed and such judgement
            or dismissal has not been vacated; and
        (2) every filed Motion which applies to that CFJ has been
            either granted or denied.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 1, to read:

      (a) The Clerk of the Courts shall, within one week of the time a
          Player earns a Judicial Salary, pay out that Judicial Salary
          to that Player.

      (b) If a decision (or dismissal) which resulted in a Player
          earning a Judicial Salary is subsequently appealed and
          overturned on appeal, the Clerk of the Courts shall vacate
          the Payment Order paying the salary originally received for
          that decision.

      (c) There shall exist a type of Application called an
          Application to Submit an Opinion. Such an Application, if
          effective, has the effect of annotating a Judgement or
          Dismissal in a given Call for Judgement. In order for such
          an Application to have effect upon Execution, it must
          satisfy the following requirements:

      (d) * It must clearly indicate to which CFJ it applies.
          * It must be labeled as either a Concurring Opinion or
            a Dissenting Opinion.
          * It must indicate whether the Judgement or Dismissal to
            which it applies is that of the Judge or that of the
            Appeals Court.
          * It must be accompanied by reasons and arguments, which
            may include, but are not necessarily limited to, citations
            of deciding Rules, past Judgements, and Game Custom.
          * It must bear the Signatures of at least two Players.
          * It must be Executed no earlier than the submission of the
            Judgement or Dismissal to which it applies, and no later
            than one week after the publication by the Clerk of the
            Courts of that Judgement or Dismissal.

      (e) An Application to Submit an Opinion is Executed by
          submitting it to the Clerk of the Courts. Such an
          Application, having been Executed and having met all the
          requirements for effectiveness, is also called an Opinion.
          It is also referred to as a Concurring Opinion or a
          Dissenting Opinion, as indicated in the Opinion.

      (f) Once an Application to Submit an Opinion is Executed and
          takes effect, the Clerk of the Courts must distribute the
          Opinion to all Players as soon as possible. Furthermore, the
          Opinion must be appended to the Legal Judgement or
          Dismissal.

      (g) If a Call For Judgement (CFJ) clearly alleging that a Player
          has violated a specific Rule is found to be TRUE, the Player
          receives Blots equal to the Power of the violated Rule
          rounded down to the nearest whole integer, or four Blots if
          its
          Power exceeds four. This Rule defers to the wording of the
          violated Rule when it defines a Blot penalty in the specific
          case of a CFJ, or specifically forbids Blot penalties in the
          case of a CFJ.

      (h) The Player who initially called for the CFJ shall make the
          Payment Orders necessary to apply the Blots.

      (i) If such a Judgement is overturned upon appeal, then the
          Player who received Blots shall vacate the Blots that were
          given due to the initial Judgement of the CFJ.

      (j) Once a Board of Appeals has been selected to decide a
          particular appeal, the Justices shall, collectively,
          consider the question.

      (k) Each Justice has seven days, from the point e becomes
          Justice on a particular Board, in which to reach a
          determination that either sustains or overturns the matter
          being considered by that Board and submit it to the CotC.

      (l) Failure to do so is the Infraction of Failing to Judge an
          Appeal, detected and reported by the CotC, bearing a penalty
          of 3 Blots, which results in that Justice's dismissal as a
          Justice from that Board. In this case the CotC must randomly
          select an eligible Player to replace em.

      (m) After all three Justices have submitted their determinations
          to the CotC, the CotC shall post these determinations in the
          Public Forum along with any arguments, evidence, or other
          material included with those determinations.

      (n) If a majority of the Justices agree to sustain the matter
          being considered, it is sustained; otherwise, it is
          overturned. The specific results of overturning a matter
          upon appeal are determined by the Rules permitting such
          appeals.

      (o) Each Justice who submits eir determination to the CotC
          before the end of the assigned deliberation period shall
          receive a Judicial Salary of 1 VT upon the publication of
          eir determination.

      (p) When any Player believes that a Subordinate Legal Code (SLC)
          has been violated by a Player within the SLC's Jurisdiction
          e shall inform the Maintainer of that SLC of that belief,
          along with the nature of the violation, the violated text of
          the SLC, and the identity of the violating Player. The
          Maintainer shall then, as soon as possible, distribute this
          information to all Players within the Jurisdiction of the
          violated SLC.

      (q) If, within 72 hours of this distribution, no Player within
          the SLC's Jurisdiction disputes the claim, the Maintainer
          shall declare the SLC violated. The Maintainer is then
          allowed to initiate any corrections and penalties allowed by
          the Rules and the violated SLC.

      (r) If any Player under the SLC's Jurisdiction disputes the
          claim of violation within 72 hours, then any Player may
          submit a Call for Judgement, alleging that a specific Player
          has violated the SLC. Such a CFJ cannot be made in any other
          circumstance.

      (s) All Players within the SLC's Jurisdiction are automatically
          ineligible to Judge such a CFJ.

      (t) Whenever such a CFJ is found TRUE, the SLC has been violated
          and the SLC's Maintainer shall perform the same duties as
          when no Player contests the claim. If such a TRUE Judgement
          is overturned on Appeal, those actions shall be reversed to
          the extent possible immediately upon the resolution of the
          appeal.

      (u) In order for an Official Document to be valid for the
          purpose of a Ratification, it must satisfy all the following
          criteria at the time the Proposal which would Ratify it is
          Proposed:

           (v) i) The Rules require some specific Player to produce
               and/or
                  maintain the document.
              ii) The Rules required it to be published in the Public
                  Forum. (A requirement that it be sent to all Players
                  fulfills this criterion.)
             iii) It is not currently subject to a Claim of Error.
             (COE)
              iv) It is not currently subject to a pending Call for
                  Judgement (CFJ), or a pending Appeal of a CFJ.
               v) The information within the Document has not been
                  superseded by a subsequent Document.
              vi) The Document is not the Ruleset. The Ruleset is
                  specifically excluded from Ratification.

      (w) Further, a Document can become invalid during the Voting
          Period of a Proposal which would Ratify it if any of the
          following occurs:

           (x) i) The Document is superseded by a subsequent Document
                  which contradicts the information in the prior
                  Document. This does not apply if there is a COE
                  alleging the contradiction is an error, and the
                  error is admitted before the end of the Proposal's
                  Voting Period.
              ii) A COE is made on the Document, and the COE has not
              been
                  denied before the end of the Proposal's Voting
                  Period.
             iii) The Document becomes subject to a pending CFJ or a
                  pending appeal of a CFJ.

       (y) If, during the Voting Period of a Proposal to Ratify a
           Document, another Document is issued that does not
           contradict the prior Document, it does not alter the
           validity of the prior Document.

       (z) A Judge must dismiss a CFJ if one of the following is true
           of it:

        (aa) i) It contains no clearly-identifiable Statement.
            ii) Its Statement can not logically admit to either being
            TRUE
                or FALSE.
           iii) Its Statement does not relate to a matter relevant to
           the
                Rules.
            iv) Its Statement fails to comply with the Rules.
             v) It lacks standing, as defined elsewhere.
            vi) After a reasonable effort by the Judge to obtain all
                relevant information, no determination can be made of
                the truth or falsity of its Statement.

      (bb) The Judge does this by notifying the CotC of the CFJ's
           dismissal, and the reasons e is doing so. Dismissals are
           only legal when made for the reasons listed in this Rule.
           Dismissal occurs when the CotC is notified of a legal
           dismissal.

      (cc) As soon as possible after being notified of a legal
           dismissal, the CotC must post to the Public Forum a notice
           of the dismissal and the Judge's reasons for doing so.

      (dd) If the dismissal, upon appeal, is subsequently set aside,
           then that CFJ is no longer dismissed. It shall be
           considered again and can not again be legally dismissed for
           the same reasons.

      (ee) A Judge who dismisses a CFJ before the end of the assigned
           deliberation period shall receive a Judicial Salary of 1
           VT.

      (ff) The Clerk of the Courts shall make an announcement in the
           Public Forum as soon as possible after an Appeal has been
           initiated, including in eir announcement the matter of
           consideration of the Appeal and the identity of the
           Justices selected to serve on the Board of Appeals and
           which (if any) of these Players are ineligible to fill the
           positions to which they have been assigned.

      (gg) The Clerk shall also make an announcement to the Public
           Forum as soon as possible after any change in the identity
           of the Justices that takes place after the Board has been
           constituted.

      (hh) If the Judgement of a CFJ is Appealed, the Board of Appeals
           shall consider the correctness of that Judgement. The Board
           may rule that the original Judgement was either correct or
           incorrect.

      (ii) If a majority of the Justices find that the original
           Judgement was correct, then the Board's ruling is that the
           original Judgement was correct. In that case, the original
           Judge of the CFJ shall retain eir Judicial Salary and the
           original Judgement has legal effect.

      (jj) If a majority of the Justices find that the original
           Judgement was incorrect, then the Board's ruling is that
           the original Judgement was incorrect. In that case, the
           original Judge
           of the CFJ shall forfeit eir Judicial Salary. The Board may
           then act in one of three ways, provided that a majority of
           the Justices agree:

        (kk) i) Reversal of the Judgement. In this case, the CFJ shall
                be treated as if it were Judged normally, with the
                Judgement being that which a majority of the Justices
                agree on.
            ii) Dismissal of the CFJ. The CFJ shall be considered
                dismissed.
           iii) Re-assignment of the CFJ. In this case, the original
                Judgement shall be ignored, and the CotC shall
                reassign the CFJ to a new Judge in the same fashion as
                it was originally assigned; the original Judge will be
                considered Ineligible. The new Judge cannot make the
                same Judgement as the original Judge for the same
                reason.

      (ll) If a majority of the Justices find that the original
           Judgement was incorrect, but no majority of the Justices
           agree on what action to take, then the CFJ shall be
           re-assigned as above.

      (mm) If the dismissal of a CFJ is Appealed, the Board shall not
           consider the truth or falsity of the original CFJ; they
           shall only consider whether the dismissal was properly
           made. An illegal dismissal shall not be considered
           "properly made."

      (nn) If the Board finds the dismissal to have been properly
           made, the original Judge of the CFJ shall retain eir
           Judicial Salary, and the CFJ shall remain dismissed.

      (oo) If the Board finds the dismissal to have been made
           improperly, the original Judge of the CFJ shall have eir
           Judicial Salary revoked. The CotC shall reassign the CFJ
           to a new Judge in the same fashion as originally
           assigned; the new Judge cannot dismiss it for the same
           reasons as given by the original Judge.

      (pp) In the appeal of a Judicial Order, the Board shall consider
           whether the Order in question was both legally made and
           appropriate for the situation.

      (qq) If the Board finds that the Order was made legally, and was
           appropriate for the situation, it shall affirm the Order.
           If an Order staying the execution of the appealed Order was
           entered, it shall vacate this stay.

      (rr) If the Board finds that the Order was made illegally, or
           that it was inappropriate for the situation, it shall
           vacate the original Order. Should the Board further find
           that the Order was made without reasonable justification or
           for a clearly improper purpose, it shall (at its
           discretion) impose a penalty of 2 Blots upon the Judge who
           made the original Order.

      (ss) WHEREAS, in June 1993, the world's only MUD-based nomic,
           Nomic World, had recently collapsed; yet, many of its
           players enjoyed nomic and did not wish to forego such a
           noble pursuit;

      (tt) And WHEREAS, Originator Chuck Carroll therefore composed an
           Initial Ruleset for an email nomic, based on the Initial
           Rulesets of Peter Suber, inventor of Nomic, and on the
           Rulesets of Nomic World and other nomics,

      (uu) And WHEREAS, a nomic thus rose like a phoenix from the
           ashes of Nomic World, played on the mailing list originally
           set up for discussion of Nomic World, and coming into
           existence at June 30, 1993, 00:04:30 GMT +1200, with a
           message sent by First Speaker Michael Norrish, which read,
           in part,

       (vv) "I see no reason to let this get bogged down; there are no
             precedents or rules that cover this situation, so I think
             we may as well begin directly.... Proposals for new rules
             are invited. In accordance with the rules, these will be
             published, numbered and distributed by me at my earliest
             convenience."

      (ww) And WHEREAS, this nomic began as a humble and nameless
           nomic, known unofficially as yoyo, after the mailing list
           it was played on, until its Players, much later, gave it
           its official name of Agora,

      (xx) And WHEREAS, Agora has now become the wisest, noblest,
           eldest, and most interesting of all active email nomics,
           due to the hard work and diligence of Agorans as well as
           the frequent advice of Agoraphobes,

      (yy) And WHEREAS, Agorans desire to joyously commemorate Agora's
           founding,

      (zz) BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED that Agora's Birthday is defined
           to be the entire day of June 30, GMT +1200, of each year;

     (aaa) BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that prior to, but not more than
           seven days before, Agora's Birthday, the Ambassador shall
           announce Agora's upcoming Birthday to all Friendly nomics;

     (bbb) BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that, not less than seven days prior
           to Agora's Birthday, the Chancellor shall, on behalf of the
           Bank, submit delayed Transfer Orders to be executed at
           00:04:30 GMT +1200 on Agora's Birthday to each Player for
           the amount of 3 VTs each;

     (ccc) BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Chancellor shall, on behalf
           of the Bank, submit Transfer Orders for one P-note each
           from the Bank to each Player who posts to the Public Forum
           during Agora's Birthday a message recognizing Agora's
           Birthday; these Transfer Orders to be executed as soon as
           possible after Agora's Birthday ends;

     (ddd) BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Notary may select up to
           three Contests, in existence on Agora's Birthday, which
           have as their purpose encouraging the celebration of
           Agora's Birthday; and which Contests, in the Notary's
           estimation, are worthy of recognition for this effort; and
           shall pay out to each such Contest 5 VTs, and to their
           Contestmasters 2 P-Notes each;

     (eee) BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Courts shall be closed on
           Agora's Birthday; that is, the Clerk of the Courts shall
           not publish any Calls For Judgement, Judgements, notices of
           Appeals, Decisions of Appeals Boards, or Opinions, on
           Agora's Birthday; nor shall any Player submit to the Clerk
           of the Courts a Call For Judgement, notice of ineligibility
           to Judge, Judgement, call for Appeal, or Appellate
           Decision, on Agora's Birthday; nor shall any Player Execute
           an Application to Submit an Opinion on Agora's Birthday;
           however, if any of the above do take place on Agora's
           Birthday, in violation of this Rule, this Rule does not
           deprive them of their usual effects.

     (fff) There are four classes of Order: Administrative, Judicial,
           Appellate, and Private.

     (ggg) A Judicial Order is an Order executed by a Player while
           acting as a Judge.

     (hhh) An Appellate Order is an Order executed by a Board of
           Appeals.

     (iii) An Administrative Order is an Order executed by the holder
           of an Office or other official position (such as the
           Speaker or the Recordkeepor of a Currency) other than that
           of a Judge or Justice, in the course of performing the
           duties of that Office or position.

     (jjj) A Private Order is any other sort of Order.

     (kkk) All Orders executed in the manner prescribed by the Rules
           for their class and type are presumed valid and enforceable
           until proven otherwise by CFJ.

     (lll) In order to be proven valid by CFJ, the Rules must permit
           the Player who executed the Order in question to execute
           such an Order, that the execution of the Order must have
           been required by or permitted in the circumstances which
           existed at the time it was executed, and that the Order has
           not been rendered invalid by the operation of any other
           Rule.

     (mmm) Furthermore, no Order may act to prevent or hinder its own
           appeal in any way, and any portion of an Order which has
           this effect is void and without force.

     (nnn) Any Order, except a Transfer Order, may always be amended,
           stayed, or vacated by the Player (or, in the case of
           Appellate Orders, Board of Appeal) who executed it. A
           Delayed Transfer Order may be amended, stayed or vacated by
           the Player who executed it only during the time in which it
           is delayed. Certain classes of Orders may be amended,
           stayed, or vacated in other circumstances as well, when the
           Rules so allow. In all cases, this is done by an Order to
           Amend, Stay, or Vacate, respectively, the original Order.

     (ooo) Otherwise, an Order shall not be amended, stayed, vacated,
           or otherwise changed once executed.

     (ppp) Judicial Orders are subject to appeal to a Board of Appeal
           by a Call for Appeal.

     (qqq) The Board of Appeal shall, upon finding that a Judicial
           Order is improperly or invalidly executed, order that that
           Order be amended or vacated, as it deems appropriate.

     (rrr) When the Clerk of the Courts receives a properly executed
           Call for Appeal of a Judicial Order, the Clerk of the
           Courts shall stay the Order under appeal. If the Board of
           Appeals affirms the validity of the original Order, it
           shall then vacate this stay.

     (sss) Appellate Orders are executed by being sent to the Clerk of
           the Courts by the Lead Justice of a Board of Appeals, but
           do not take effect until their publication by the Clerk of
           the Courts. The Lead Justice shall certify in eir
           submission to the Clerk of the Courts that the Order is
           executed by the concurrence of the majority of the Justices
           comprising that Board of Appeals; failure to do so deprives
           the Order of effect.

     (ttt) The Clerk of the Courts shall publish each Appellate Order
           as soon as possible after receiving it from the Board of
           Appeal which executed it.

     (uuu) Appellate Orders are not subject to appeal. However, upon a
           judicial finding that the required certification was
           falsely provided, the Justiciar shall vacate the Order
           which was accompanied by that false certification.

     (vvv) Since Appellate Orders cannot be appealed, Appellate Orders
           are valid only if addressed to:
             a) The Clerk of the Courts in eir Official capacity;
             b) an Order issued by the Clerk of the Courts in eir
             Official
                Capacity;
             c) The Judge of the CFJ which that Board of Appeals was
                convened to consider, or any Order issued by that
                Judge in that particular CFJ; or
             d) any combination of the above.

     (www) All other Appellate Orders are presumptively invalid.

     (xxx) This Rule takes precedence over all Rules pertaining to the
           validity of Appellate Orders.

     (yyy) Both Administrative and Private Orders are subject to
           appeal by a CFJ, the statement of which Statement alleges
           that the Order is improperly or invalidly executed.

     (zzz) Upon a judicial finding that an Administrative or Private
           Order was improperly or invalidly executed, the Judge so
           finding shall vacate that Order.

    (aaaa) When the Clerk of the Courts receives a properly executed
           Call for Judgement, the statement of which alleges that an
           Administrative or Private Order was improperly or invalidly
           executed, the Clerk of the Courts shall stay the Order in
           dispute. If the Judge affirms the validity of the original
           Order, e shall then vacate this stay.

    (bbbb) The Lead Justice of a Board of Appeals is the Justiciar, if
           e is serving on that Board, or the Player who serves in the
           place of the Justiciar otherwise.

    (cccc) Players receive Points when certain actions are performed
           by them or when certain events occur. This is the only Rule
           which may define the methods of Scoring. In general, a
           Player may receive points only for actions which occur
           during the current Round, although those actions may depend
           on others which occurred previously (thus, for example, a
           Player could gain points for one of eir Proposals passing,
           even if the Proposal was distributed before the beginning
           of the current Round.). Points are non-transferable.

    (dddd) In general, a Player may receive points for a certain type
           of event any number of times, unless that event has a
           number (N) after it, in which case a given Player may be
           awarded points for that type of event only N times in a
           given Round.

    (eeee) If not otherwise noted, Points awarded for events referring
           to "a Player" or "any Player", go to that Player. Bonuses
           are in addition to the basic award. Multipliers are in lieu
           of the basic award. Bonuses can be multiplied.

    (ffff) Responsibility for detecting changes to a Player's Score
           from the following events is the responsibility of the
           Scorekeepor:

    (gggg) If a Proposal proposed by a Player passes: 5 points for
           first passing Proposal by that Player in that Round, 3 for
           second, 1 for third, 0.5 for fourth and subsequent
           Proposals, +0.5 if Proposal is a Repeal, +1 if the Proposer
           does not Vote on the Proposal. Double points if Proposal
           passes unanimously. Triple Points if the Player making the
           Proposal is the only Entity who votes AGAINST.

    (hhhh) To any Player winning a contested Election: 8 points.
           Double points if Elected unanimously.

    (iiii) To any Player holding the most of a given currency at the
           end of a Round: 8 Points per currency. Tripled if at any
           point during the Round a Player had no holdings in that
           Currency.

    (jjjj) To any Player tied for the most of a given currency at the
           end of a Round: 5 Points per currency. Tripled if at any
           point during the Round a Player had no holdings in that
           Currency.

    (kkkk) To any Player holding no Currency whatsoever at the end of
           a Round: 5 Points.

    (llll) To any Player earning no Blots during a Round: 4 Points.

    (mmmm) To any Player having no Blots at the end of a Round: 6
           Points.

    (nnnn) To any Player voting on a Proposal: If the Player casts at
           least one vote which is the same as 80% or more of the
           Votes cast on a Proposal (including eir own): 1 Point,
           scored when the Proposal results are announced.

    (oooo) To any Player voting on a Proposal: If the final tally of
           Votes shows the same number of FOR votes as AGAINST votes:
           2 Points, scored when the Proposal results are announced.

    (pppp) To the Player Voting or declaring Presence on all Proposals
           of a single distribution: 0.5 Points.

    (qqqq) Changes to a Player's score from the following events may
           be reported by any Player by notifying the Scorekeepor or
           posting to the Public Forum. No Player, however, not even
           the Scorekeepor, is legally required to do so.

    (rrrr) If a Rule is created containing a Player's name in the
           text: 15 Points.

    (ssss) If a Player gains a Patent Title (other than SPTs or
           Degrees): 4 Points (1).

    (tttt) To any Player receiving a Degree: 4 Points for am A.N., 6
           points for a B.N., 8 Points for a M.N., and 12 Points for a
           D.N.Phil or a D.N.Hist.

    (uuuu) If a Proposal made by a Player successfully creates a Rule
           with a number that is a multiple of 23: 4 Points.

    (vvvv) If a Player submits a Proposal to the Queue that is
           subsequently discarded: 5 Points (1).

    (wwww) To any Player Proposing an Insane Proposal for which no
           Entity votes FOR: 30 Points.

    (xxxx) To any Player who is chided for posting a single document
           that is not an Official Report to a forum other than the
           Public Forum by more than one Player (other than
           themselves): 2 Points (1).

    (yyyy) To the third Player other than the Poster making
           substantive comments to a protoproposal: 1 Point (3).

    (zzzz) To the Player making a COE that is Responded to and
           admitted by the relevant Officer (other than themselves): 1
           Point (1).

   (aaaaa) To the Player Holding an Office for at least one month
           during the Round, and issuing at least one Official Report:
           2 Points (1)

   (bbbbb) To the Player making a Sane Proposal for which a Non-Player
           Voting Entity successfully Votes: 15 points (1).

   (ccccc) To the Player making a Senate Proposal for which a

   (eeeee) To the Player making a CFJ which is not Judged for one
           month from its original assignment: 8 Points (1 per Player
           per CFJ).

   (fffff) When an Appeal successfully overturns a Judgment, to the
           Players calling for that Appeal: 2 Points

   (ggggg) When an Appeal fails to overturn a Judgment, to the Judge
           who made the original Judgment on that CFJ: 4 Points.

   (hhhhh) If three consecutive CFJs are Judged TRUE, FALSE and
           UNDECIDED (in any order), to the Player making the third
           CFJ: 17 Points.

   (iiiii) When a Player is Deregistered due to Silence, to the Player
           last making em Silent: 5 Points.

155. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Satisfying Payment Orders

Be it resolved, that Rule 1732 be amended to read:

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 1, to read:

      (a) A Payment Order is satisfied when a number of units of
          Currency equal in number and kind to that named in the
          Payment Order are successfully transferred to the payee
          named in the Payment Order, provided also that:
        (1) the Executor of the Transfer Order which effected that
            transfer clearly indicated at the time e executed the
            Transfer Order that the transfer was being made for the
            purpose of satisfying that Payment Order; and

      (b) A Payment Order may be satisfied at most once, and a vacated
          Payment Order may not be satisfied after being vacated.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

156. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Eliminate ASAP I

Be it resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Whenever the Rules require a Player to perform some duty
          after the occurence of an event, and specifies a time limit
          for doing so, the failure of that Player to perform the duty
          within that time limit in no way abates that Player's
          obligation to perform that duty, unless the Rule which
          imposes that obligation specifies otherwise.

      (b) Whenever the Rules require a Player to perform some duty at
          least once within any given time interval (such as once each
          week, or each month), and that Player fails to do so, e is
          not obligated to do so twice during the next such time
          period, unless the Rule which imposes that obligation
          specifies otherwise.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 208 be amended to read:

      (a) The Assessor shall publish all the Votes cast upon a
          Proposal within seven days of the end of that Proposal's
          Voting Period.

      (b) The Assessor shall not publish the Votes cast on a Proposal
          prior to the time e publishes the Votes cast on:
        (1) all Proposals whose Voting Periods ended before that of
            the Proposal in question, and
        (2) all Proposals whose Voting Periods ended at the same time
            as the Proposal in question and which have a lower number.

158. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Make the Proposal Queue More
Competitive

Be it resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) The Proposal Tariff is a number of P-Notes (which must be a
          multiple of the MUQ for P-Notes), greater than 0 and not
          more than 2.

      (b) The value of the Proposal Tariff, upon the adoption of the
          Proposal which created this Rule, is 1.

      (c) The Promotor may change the value of the Proposal Tariff by
          announcing its new value in the Public Forum, provided that
          the new value is within the range allowed by subdivision (a)
          of this Rule.

      (d) Whenever a new value is announced according to subdivision
          (c) of this Rule, the new value takes effect at the
          beginning of the next Nomic Week, unless the announcement is
          made within three days of the end of the current Nomic Week,
          in which case the new value takes effect at the beginning of
          the Nomic Week following the next Nomic Week.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1771 be amended to read:

      A Player may increase or decrease the Priority of a Proposal in
      the Queue by announcing to the Public Forum that e does so, and
      paying a number of P-Notes to the Bank. For each multiple of the
      Proposal Tariff e pays to the Bank, the Priority of the Proposal
      is increased or decreased by one, as specified by the Player
      making the payment, provided that this transfer is not executed
      for any other purpose.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1701 be amended, by replacing "is 1"
with "is 0.01".

Simplify Probate

| Be it resolved, that Rules 1738, 1739 and 1757 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1601 be amended to read:

|     (a) An entity is disempowered if it does not have an Executor. A
|         Payment Order naming a disempowered entity as payor is a
|         debt of that entity.

|     (b) The Notary may, with respect to a disempowered entity,
|         transfer Currencies owned by the disempowered entity:
|       (1) to any entity named as a payee of a debt of the
|           disempowered entity; or
|       (2) to any entity, consistent with the established Will of the
|           disempowered entity, provided that there are no debts of
|           the disempowered entity in the Currency to be transferred.

|     (c) The transfer of currencies under subdivision (b)(2) is
|         subject to judicial review. Upon a judicial finding that a
|         transfer made under subdivision (b)(2) was not permitted by
|         that subdivision or was inconsistent with the established
|         Will of that entity, the Judge of the CFJ making that
|         finding shall vacate the affected transfer.
|
|     (d) In addition, the Notary may, with respect to any dissolute
|         entity and Without Objection:
|       (1) vacate any Payment Order naming the disempowered entity as
|           payor or payee; or
|       (2) transfer any or all Currencies owned by that entity to the
|           Bank.
|
|     (e) A disempowered entity is considered to continue to have
          legal existence as long as it continues to possess units of
          Currency or is named as the payor or payee of a Payment
          Order, even if it would otherwise be dissolved or destroyed,
          or otherwise cease to have legal existence, prior to that
|         time. The Notary shall make a diligent and good faith effort
|         to dispose of the Currencies and Payment Orders of any
|         dissolute entity, subject to the conditions of this Rule.

|     (f) This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would impair
          the Notary in the exercise of the powers granted in
|         subdivisions (b) and (d) of this Rule.
|
| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1637 be amended to read:
|
|     (b) A Will is a document specifying how the Notary is to be
|         instructed to dispose of the Currencies possessed by an
|         entity in the event that entity becomes disempowered.
|
|     (c) A Will is established by the Execution of an Application to
|         Establish a Will.
|
|     (d) An Application to Establish a Will must set forth the Will
|         to be established and the entity for which the Will is to be
|         established, and be signed by by the Executor of that
|         entity.
|
|     (e) An Application to Establish a Will is executed by submitting
|         it to the Notary.
|
|     (f) The effect of Executing an Application to Establish a Will
|         is to establish the Will contained within the Application
|         for the entity named by the Application. The establishment
|         of a Will for an entity renders void any previous Will
|         established for that entity.

Powers of Attorney

Be it resolved, that Rules 1841 and 1842 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 1, to read:

      (a) A Player (hereinafter, the Grantee) who lawfully holds a
          grant of Power of Attorney for another Player (hereinafter
          the Grantor) is, for the duration of that grant, the
          Executor of the Grantor, and may act in the Grantor's behalf
          for as long as the Grantee lawfully holds the Power of
          Attorney. However, this power to act on the Grantor's behalf
          shall not extend to the performance of any privilege, duty,
          or power of any Office held by the Grantee.

      (b) Power of Attorney is granted by Public Forum Announcement.
          The announcement shall be posted by the Grantor and shall
          set forth:
        (1) the name of the Grantee; and
        (2) the dates upon which the grant shall begin and end.

      (c) A Player may grant Power of Attorney to another Player only
          if:
        (1) the Grantor has been continuously registered for the two
            months immediately prior to the announcement;
        (2) the Grantee is a Player and is not on Hold at the time of
            the announcement;
        (3) the grant is to begin within one week of the time of the
            announcement;
        (4) the grant is to end within three months of the time of the
            announcement;
        (5) the Grantee holds a grant of Power of Attorney for at most
            one other Player at the time of the announcement; and
        (6) the Grantee has not granted Power of Attorney to anyone
            else.

      (d) A grant is terminated if:
        (1) the Grantee ceases to be a Player or goes on Hold;
        (2) the Grantor ceases to be a Player;
        (3) the Grantee fails to consent, by Public Forum
            Announcement, to the grant before the time the grant
            begins;
        (4) the grant's specified period expires;
        (5) the Grantee grants Power of Attorney to anyone else; or
        (6) the Grantor cancels the grant, by Public Forum
            Announcement.

      (e) For the purpose of subdivision (a), the term "privilege,
          duty, or power of any Office" includes those of the Speaker,
          and those of a Judge or Justice, with respect to a Grantor
          who holds any of these positions.

Appeal Tweaks

Be it resolved, that Rule 1570 be amended to read:

      (a) As soon as possible after an Application for Appeal of a
          Judgement or Motion has been executed, the Clerk of the
          Court shall:
        (1) assign, according to the procedures defined elsewhere,
            three Players to serve as the Board of Appeal for that
            Appeal; and
        (2) publish a Notice of Appeal identifying the Judgement or
            Motion being Appealed, and the identity of the three
            Players selected under subparagraph (a)(1) above.

      (b) The Clerk of the Courts shall develop and utilize a system
          of numbering or otherwise identifying Calls for Appeals such
          that Players may readily and unambiguously refer to any
          individual Appeal without undue difficulty or confusion.

      (c) If the Clerk of the Courts is in doubt as to whether an
          Application for Appeal has been successfully executed, e
          shall proceed as if it had been successfully executed,
          reserving the question of successful execution to the Board
          of Appeals.

      (d) If the Board of Appeals finds that the Application for
          Appeal which led to the appointment of that Board was not
          successfully executed, it may (at its discretion) dismiss
          the Appeal, without making any ruling on the merits of the
          Appeal.

162. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Some Housecleaning

Be it resolved, that Rule 408 be amended to read:

      (a) The Judge of an open CFJ is required to, within seven days
          of when that CFJ last became open or seven days of eir
          assignment to that CFJ, whichever is later, close that CFJ
          by dismissing or judging the CFJ and/or granting or denying
          any outstanding judicial motions pertaining to that CFJ.

      (b) The failure of a Judge to close a case within the prescribed
          time constitutes the Infraction of Judicial Tardiness and
          carries a penalty of one Blot for each day (or fraction
          thereof) that the case remains open beyond the permitted
          time.  This penalty is to be reported by the Clerk of the
          Courts.

      (c) The failure to observe this time limit does not, by itself,
          cause the delinquent Judge to be recused from the CFJ, nor
          does it invalidate eir judgment or dismissal of the CFJ or
          grant or denial of any related judicial motion which that
          Judge might submit after the limit has expired.

      (d) This Rule defers to any other Rule which prescribes a
          different time limit in which a CFJ must be closed, and to
          any other Rule which establishes procedures by which the
          time limit specified in this Rule may be extended or
          shortened.

Currencies

Be it resolved, that Rule 1721 be amended to read:

      There shall exist the Office of Chancellor.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1467 be amended to read:

      (a) A Currency is any medium of exchange which has been
          designated as a Currency in accordance with the Rules.

      (b) The designation of a medium of exchange as a Currency, and
          the cancellation of such designation, may be accomplished
          only by:
        (1) the operation of an Instrument with Power 1 or greater;
        (2) the Chancellor, Without Objection; or
        (3) Judicial Order, whenever the Rules so permit.

      (c) For the purposes of the Rules, units of a Currency are
          fungible and indivisible.

      (d) A Currency may be denominated such that a fraction of its
          primary denomination is its smallest indivisible unit, so
          long as there is a smallest indivisible unit.  When no other
          specification exists, the smallest indivisible unit of a
          Currency shall be one unit of its smallest denomination.
          Amounts less than this smallest indivisible unit may be used
          in intermediate calculations; all such calculations shall be
          rounded off at the point that they are reduced to transfers,
          orders to transfer, or other finalized results of legal
          import.

      (e) The Chancellor shall retain and publish at least monthly a
          schedule, listing every medium of exchange designated as a
          Currency under this Rule.  This schedule shall include
          whatever information the Chancellor deems necessary, but at
          least the following information for each Currency:
        (1) the designated denomination or denominations of that
            Currency (and if more than one, the relationship between
            them);
        (2) the fraction of the smallest denomination of that Currency
            which is its smallest indivisible unit;
        (3) that Currency's Recordkeepor; and,
        (4) the Mintor or Mintors of that Currency, if any.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) The "Recordkeeper" of a Currency refers to the entity who
          has agreed to maintain a record of the ownership of the
          units of that Currency.  The Recordkeepor of an Currency is
          subject to the jurisdiction of these Rules.  Specifically, e
          shall:
        (1) maintain the abovementioned records in a manner consistent
            with these Rules, including the timely recordation of
            transfers of ownership made consistent with the Rules;
        (2) comply in a timely manner to all requests to produce those
            records as required by the Rules; and
        (3) perform all other duties which the Rules impose upon the
            Recordkeepor of a Currency.

      (b) A Currency may have any number of designated Mintors.  A
          Mintor may be designated for a Currency, or such designated
          cancelled, by:
        (1) the operation of an Instrument with Power 1 or greater; or
        (2) the Chancellor, Without Objection.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1598 be amended to read:

      Units of a Currency are transferred only when the Recordkeepor
      of that Currency receives a notice from the owner of one or more
      units of that Currency, specifying the units to be transferred
      and the entity who is to owner the units thus transferred.  The
      entity receiving the units thus transferred becomes their owner,
      and the Recordkeepor shall so note this on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1471 be amended to read:

      Units of a Currency are created only when the Recordkeepor of
      that Currency receives a notice from a designated Mintor of that
      Currency, specifying the number of units to be created and the
      entity who is to own the units so created.  The specified entity
      owns the units so created, and the Recordkeepor shall so note
      this on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      Units of a Currency are destroyed only when the Recordkeepor of
      that Currency receives a notice from the owner of one or more
      units of that Currency, specifying the units to be destroyed.
      The Recordkeepor shall note this destruction on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1596 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever an entity becomes indebted to another for some
          amount of Currency, that entity indebted is required to
          transfer that amount of Currency to the entity indebted to
          within seven days.

      (b) A debt not paid within seven days is overdue.  Any entity to
          whom an overdue debt is due may assess a late penalty of not
          more than 25% of the overdue debt, and may do so repeatedly,
          not more than once every seven days after the debt becomes
          overdue.  Late penalties are added to the overdue debt.  An
          entity may elect to charge smaller late penalties, charge
          them less frequently, or forego late penalties altogether,
          at that entity's sole discretion.

      (c) If the validity of a debt, or any part thereof, is disputed
          by a Call for Judgement, that debt (or portion thereof) is
          not considered overdue, and does not accrue late penalties,
          while the dispute remains unsettled.

      (d) When an entity transfers units of Currency to another entity
          for the purpose of making a payment on debt, the receiving
          entity shall apply that payment to the nondisputed debts
          owed to em by the transferring entity, in order from oldest
          to newest.  A debt is paid when a transfer has been applied
          to it in this manner.  Any surplus may be returned to the
          transferring entity, or may be retained by the receiving
|         entity to be applied to future debts. Any amount retained by
|         a receiving entity in this manner shall be returned upon
          demand.

      (e) An entity may assume that any Currencies transferred to it
          to be payments on debts due to em, unless the transferree
          clearly indicates otherwise when making the transfer.

      (f) An entity who is owed an overdue debt may issue an Order
          requiring the entity who owes that debt to make payment by
          requiring a transfer of any amount up to the amount of the
          debt due, but only if no other Order currently in force
          requires the same entity to make payment on that same debt
          or any part thereof.  Such an Order shall be stayed (by the
          Clerk of the Courts) if the debt in question is subsequently
          disputed, and vacated (by the Judge) if it is found that the
          debt upon which the Order is based is invalid.

      (g) An entity who is owed a debt may cancel all or part of that
          debt at any time.

      (h) A Judge may enjoin the assessment of late penalties,
          restrict the amount of late penalties, or require the
          reduction or cancellation of a debt, by Judicial Order, when
          the Rules specifically so allow.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1479 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever a Rule calls for an Officer to pay out some
          quantity of Currency to some entity, that Officer shall
          execute a Notice of Debt for the given amount with that
          entity as payee and the Bank as payor.

      (b) Whenever a Rule calls for an Officer to bill an entity for
          some quantity of Currency, that Officer shall execute a
          Notice of Debt for the given amount with that entity as
          payor and the Bank as payee.

      (c) A Notice of Debt is executed by announcing in the Public
          Forum that the payor is indebted to the payee for the amount
          indicated, so long as the announcement sets for the reason
          therefore.

      (d) The lawful execution of a Notice of Debt causes the payor
          noted therein to be indebted to the payee noted therein for
          the amount noted therein, but only if the executor of the
          Notice of Debt was authorized to execute it, and the reason
          set forth therein is correct.

      (e) The duties required of Officers by this Rule shall be
          performed as soon as possible after they arise.

      (f) For the purposes of this Rule, the Speaker shall be
          considered an Officer.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1817 be amended to read:

      (a) The Recordkeepor of a Currency is required to record every
          transfer for which e receives a transfer notice denominated
          in the Currency of which e is the recordkeepor, when:
        (1) the notice was sent by the transferring entity's Executor,
            or, for an entity which lacks an Executor, by any other
            person empowered by the Rules to execute transfers on the
            behalf of the transferring entity;
        (2) the notice clearly sets forth the quantity to be
            transferred in a form such that the Recordkeepor can
            easily and definitively determine the amount being
            transferred;
        (3) the entity to receive the transfer is specified with
            sufficient clarity that a reasonable person in the
            Recordkeepor's position would know to which entity the
            transferring entity refers; and
        (4) the transfer is for an amount not more than the current
            holdings of the transferring entity.

      (b) Transfers shall be noted on the Recordkeepor's records in
          the order in which they are received by the Recordkeepor.

      (c) When a Recordkeepor records a transfer, e shall promptly
          inform the recipient of the transfer that the transfer has
          been recorded, unless it appears to the Recordkeepor that
          the recipient is already aware of the transfer.

      (d) When a Recordkeepor elects not to record a transfer for the
          reason that the transfer is not in conformance with any part
          of subdivision (a) of this Rule, e shall promptly inform
          both the transferrer and the recipient that the transfer has
          not be recorded, and give the reason therefor.  (If the
          reason for failure to record is that the recipient was not
          clearly specified, there is no duty to inform the
          recipient.)

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1696 be amended to read:

      (a) Voting Tokens are hereby designated as a Currency.  The sole
          designated Mintor of Voting Tokens is the Bank.  The
          Recordkeepor of Voting Tokens is irrevocably designated to
          be the Accountor.  The smallest indivisible unit for this
          Currency is 0.01 Voting Token.

      (b) The Accountor agrees to act as Recordkeepor for Voting
          Tokens by accepting the Office.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1701 be amended to read:

|     (a) Proposal Notes are hereby designated as a Currency. The sole
|         designated Mintor of Proposal Notes is the Bank. The

          be the Promotor.  The smallest indivisible unit for the
          Currency is 0.1 Proposal Note.

      (b) The Promotor agrees to act as Recordkeepor for Proposal
          Notes by accepting the Office.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1435 be amended to read:

      (a) Indulgences are hereby designated as a Currency.  The sole
          designated Mintor of Indulgences is the Bank.  The
          Recordkeepor of Indulgences is irrevocably designated to be
          the Herald.

      (b) The Herald agrees to act as Recordkeepor for Indulgences by
          accepting the Office.

      (c) An entity which owes a debt (or debts) to the Bank for any
          number of Indulgences is said to have that number of Blots.
          A Player has Blots equal to the sum of all such debts. Debts
          which are in dispute are still considered when determining
          how many Blots a Player has.

      (d) When a Rule states that a Player is to gain some number of
          Blots, a Notice of Debt shall be executed for the same
          number of Indulgences, naming that Player as the payor and
          the Bank as payee; this order shall be executed by whomever
          the Rules require to report the change in Blots.

      (e) A Player who has no debt in Indulgences to the Bank is
          Immaculate.

      (f) It is a Win-Preventing condition for a Player to have one or
          more Blots.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1601 be amended to read:

      (a) An entity is dissolute if it:
        (1) possesses any number of units of Currency, and
        (2) does not have an Executor.

      (b) The Notary may perform any of the following with respect to
          a dissolute entity:
        (1) transfer Currencies owned by that entity to any entity to
            which the dissolute entity owes debts, for the purpose of
            making partial or complete payment on those debts;
        (2) cancel in part or in full any debts owed to it; or
        (3) Without Objection, transfer Currencies owned by that
            entity to the Bank.

      (c) The Notary is authorized, all other Rules notwithstanding,
          to transfer Currency from any dissolute entity to any other
          entity as if e were the dissolute entity's Executor, when e
          is permitted to do so in accordance with subdivision (b) of
          this Rule.

      (d) A dissolute entity is considered to continue to have legal
          existence as long as it continues to possess units of
          Currency, even if it is dissolved, destroyed, or otherwise
          would cease to have legal existence prior to that time.  An
          entity which has legal existence solely as a result of this
          subdivision is called "terminal".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1853 be amended to read:

      (a) Taxes may be levied only when the Rules explicitly permit
          it, and then only by the Officer authorized by the Rule
          permitting the levy.

      (b) An Officer levies a tax by announcing it in a Public Forum.
          An announcement of levy must specify:
        (1) The Currency being taxed;
        (2) the amount of the levy, expressed as a percentage; and
        (3) the legal authorization for the levy.

      (c) Upon the announcement of a tax levy conforming with
          subdivision (b) of this Rule, each entity other than the
          Bank becomes liable to the Bank for a debt equal to the
          stated percentage of that entity's holdings of the Currency
          stated in the announcement.  The amount of each entity's tax
          debt shall be based on the amount of that Currency owned by
          that entity at the time the announcement was made.

      (d) The Recordkeepor of the Currency named in a tax levy shall,
          as soon as possible after the announcement, provide a report
          setting out the amount of the taxed Currency held by every
          entity which held any units of that Currency at the time the
          announcement was made.  The Recordkeepor is not required to
          compute the tax due; if e does so, eir computations do not
          have any legal force.

      (e) The amount of tax levied may not exceed 50% of an entity's
          holdings unless the Rule which authorizes the tax explicitly
          permits it.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) The Voting Bank shall exist.

      (b) The Assessor is the Executor of the Voting Bank.

      (c) The Assessor shall not (as its Executor) transfer Currencies
          out of the Voting Bank except when required to do so by the
          Rules.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1442 be amended to read:

      (a) Proposals have a voting cost, equal to the Voting Tariff at
          the time they were distributed. If there was no value set
          for the Voting Tariff at that time, then the voting cost is
          1 VT.

      (b) Each Voting Entity who votes on a Proposal is liable to a
          debt to the Voting Bank for a number of Voting Tokens equal
          to the votes cast by that entity on that proposal,
|         multiplied by the voting cost of that Proposal. This debt is
|         realized when the results of the Voting on that Proposal are
|         announced.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1824 be amended to read:

      (a) Any entity who, at the beginning of a given Nomic Week, is
          overdue on a debt due to the Voting Bank, commits the
          Infraction of Debt Voting.

      (b) The penalty for Debt Voting shall be a denial of Voting
          Privileges for a period of two weeks.

      (c) Debt Voting shall be reported by the Assessor.

      (a) The Bank shall exist.

      (c) The Chancellor shall not transfer Currencies from the Bank
          except for the purpose of making payment upon the debts of
          the Bank, or when otherwise explictly required by the Rules
          to do so.

      (d) If the Chancellor makes a transfer not permitted by
          subdivision (c) of this Rule, e commits the Class A Crime of
          Misappropriation, and upon conviction of this Crime shall be
          removed from Office.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 766 be amended, by deleting the
paragraph which reads "Each Group has Mint Authority."

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1466 be amended, by replacing the
term "Payment Order" with the term "Notice of Debt" wherever it may
appear.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1742 be amended, by deleting the
sentence which reads "When restitution would involve the transfer of
Currencies, the Judge is authorized to execute whatever Payment Orders

entity not party to the agreement to make any transfer of Currency".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 502 be amended to read:

      (a) The Clerk of the Courts shall, within one week of the time a

      Agora's Birthday, the Chancellor shall, on behalf of the Bank,
      submit delayed Transfer Orders to be executed at 00:04:30 GMT
      +1200 on Agora's Birthday to each Player for the amount of 3 VTs

      otherwise changed once executed.

Be it further resolved, that Rules 1599, 1722, 1730, 1732, 1734, 1576,

164. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Motions, revisited

Be it resolved, that Rules 789, 1500, 1564, 1826, 1827, 1828 and 1868
be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 1, to read:

      (a) The Court of Appeals shall have exclusive jurisdiction to
          decide any question regarding:
        (1) the correctness or legality of the Judgement entered by a
            Judge in a Call for Judgement;
        (2) the correctness, appropriateness, or legality of any
            Judicial Order;
        (3) the correctness, appropriateness, or legality of the grant
            or denial of any Judicial Motion; or
        (4) any allegation that a Judge has failed to properly perform
            eir duties as a Judge.

      (b) A question shall be certified to the Court of Appeals by the
          Clerk of the Courts when any of the following hold:
        (1) any three Players have requested, in the Public Forum,
            that the question be certified;
        (2) the question involves the issuance of an Order binding
            some Player and that Player has requested, in the Public
            Forum, it be certified; or
        (3) the question involves the correctness of a Judgement
            convicting a Player of a Crime and that Player has
            requested, in the Public Forum, it be certified.

      (c) When a question is certified to the Court of Appeals, the
          Court shall immediately convene and collectively decide the
          question, either in the affirmative or the negative, and
          upon reaching a decision the Court shall inform the Clerk of
          the Courts of its decision and the reasons therefore.

      (d) The Court of Appeals shall also have the power to execute
          such Appellate Orders as may be necessary to enforce its
          determination, subject to the limitations established in the
          Rules upon Appellate Orders.

      (e) The Clerk of the Courts is directed to establish a system of
          nomenclature for certified questions so as to permit easy
          and unambiguous reference to them.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 1, to read:

      (a) A Motion is a formal request made by a Player to a Court.
          This may be either a Common Court or the Court of Appeals.

      (b) A Motion is filed by submitting it to the Clerk of the
          Courts, clearly identifying the CFJ or certified question to
          which the Motion applies, and setting forth the action
          requested.

      (c) The Clerk of the Courts shall forward each properly-filed
          Motion to the Court in question as soon as possible after
          receiving it.

      (d) Within five days (unless the Court defers ruling on the
          motion) the Court shall rule on the Motion, either granting
|         or denying it. If a Court fails to rule or defer ruling on a
|         Motion within the time alloted by this subdivision, it is
          assumed to have denied it.

      (e) A Court may defer ruling on a Motion by informing the Clerk
          of the Courts that it is doing so, in which case it must
          either grant or deny the Motion not later than it issues a
          decision on the CFJ or certified question with which the
          Motion is associated.  A Court may not defer ruling on a
          Motion made after a decision has been issued.  If the Court
          fails to rule on a deferred Motion by the time it issues a
          decision on the related CFJ or certified question, it is
          assumed to have denied it.

      (f) The effect of granting a Motion depends on the nature of the
          Motion granted, but generally amounts to requiring the Court
|         to perform as requested by the Motion. A Motion requesting a
|         Judicial Order, if granted, requires that Court to execute
          the Order requested.

      (g) A Court rules on a motion by filing its ruling of grant or
          denial with the Clerk of the Courts, along with any reasons
          it chooses to state.

      (h) Upon receipt of a Court's ruling on a Motion, the Clerk
          shall note the ruling made and the reasons, if any, on the
          record of the CFJ or certified question, and shall notify
          the Player who made the Motion of the ruling.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 1, to read:

      (a) Whenever a Call for Judgement is received by the Clerk of
          the Courts, the Clerk shall convene a new Common Court to
          hear that CFJ, and shall assign a Player to act as the Judge
          of that Court.

      (b) If the Player assigned as the Judge of a Court ceases to be
          eligible to act as the Judge in that Court, and any CFJ
          assigned to that Court is not fully resolved, the Clerk of
          the Courts shall assign a new Player to act as the Judge of
          that Court.

      (c) Once a CFJ is assigned to a Common Court, it shall remain
          assigned to that Court, unless transferred to another Court
          by an Order of Transfer.

      (d) The selection of Players to act as the Judge of a Common
          Court shall be made from amongst all those Players eligible
          to serve as the Judge of that Court.

      (e) Once assigned as the Judge of a Court, that Player remains
          the Judge of that Court until e is recused as Judge of that
          Court, or e ceases to be a Player.

      (f) A CFJ is fully resolved if:
        (1) it has been either judged or dismissed and such judgement
            or dismissal has not been vacated; and
        (2) every filed Motion which applies to that CFJ has been
            either granted or denied.

165. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Simpler Changing of the Voting
Tariff

Be it resolved, that Rule 1682 be amended to read:

      The Voting Tariff is a number of VTs, a multiple of the MUQ for
      VTs, between 0 and 2 inclusive.  The Assessor may set the Voting
      Tariff to any value in this range at any time by announcing the
      change in the Public Forum; the change takes effect 72 hours
      after it is announced.  Until the Assessor sets another value,
      the Voting Tariff is 1 VT.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

166. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Revamp the Promotor's Office

Be it resolved, that Rules 1036, 1839, 1770, 1771, 1772, 1773 and 1774
be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) A Proposal enters the Proposal Queue when it is received
          from a Proposing Entity by the Promotor.

      (b) A Proposal leaves the Proposal Queue when it is distributed,
          withdrawn, or discarded, or when the Rules otherwise require
          it.

      (c) The Promotor may, by Public Forum Announcement, discard any
          Proposal in the Proposal Queue which was Proposed over a
          month previously and which has zero or negative Priority.

      (d) The Proposer of a Proposal in the Queue may, by Public Forum
          Announcement, remove that Proposal from the Queue.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Each Proposal in the Proposal Queue has a priority, which
          shall be an integer multiple of the MUQ for P-Notes.
        (1) When a Proposal enters the Proposal Queue, it has a
            priority of zero.
        (2) Any Player may, by Public Forum Announcement, increase or
            decrease the Priority of a Proposal in the Proposal Queue
            by any amount provided that e simultaneously transfers to
            the Bank a quantity of P-Notes equal in number to the
            magnitude of the change e wishes to make, and further
            provided that that transfer is not made for any other
            purpose.
        (3) At most once in each week, the Promotor may, by Public
            Forum Announcement, increase by one the Priority of any
            Proposal in the Proposal Queue, provided that the Proposal
            was not Proposed by emself.
        (4) At the beginning of each month, the priority of all
            Proposals in the Proposal Queue which were proposed over a
            month previously is decreased by one.  The Promotor shall
            report all such changes as soon as possible after the
            beginning of the month.

      (b) Proposals in the Proposal Queue are sorted in Queue Order by
          ordering them by descending Priority; Proposals with the
          same Priority are ordered by increasing time in the Proposal
          Queue.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Each week, the Promotor shall select from the Proposal Queue
          and distribute a number of Proposals equal to that week's
          Proposal Limit.
        (1) The Proposal Limit for a given week shall be the lesser
            of:
          (A) the number of Proposals, at the time of the first
              distribution of Proposals in that week, in the Proposal
              Queue with Priority greater than the Priority Bar; and
          (B) the Maximum Proposal Limit in effect at the start of
              that week.
        (2) Proposals shall be selected for distribution from the head
            of the Proposal Queue, in descending Queue Order.

      (b) The Maximum Proposal Limit is an integer between two and
          six, inclusive.  The Promotor may set the Maximum Proposal
          Limit to any value in this range at any time by announcing
          the change in the Public Forum; the change takes effect 72
|         hours after it is announced. Until the Promotor sets another
|         value, the Maximum Proposal Limit is three.

      (c) The Promotor shall endeavor to distribute all of the
          Proposals required to be distributed in a given week at one
          time; however, supplemental distributions are permitted only
          within the same week if, for some reason, the previous
          distribution(s) in that week do not exhaust that week's
          Proposal Limit.

      (d) A message is a Proposal Distribution only if it claims
          explicitly to be so.  The message distributing a Proposal
          shall set forth its exact text, and should also set forth
          the identity of its Proposing Entity, and its requested
          Adoption Index.  Any error in the text of a Proposal as
          distributed renders its distribution void.  A second or
          subsequent distribution of a Proposal previously distributed
          is also void.  An error in any other part of a distribution
          has no effect on the validity of that distribution.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) The Promotor shall publish the Proposal Queue weekly. This
          publication shall set forth, for each Proposal then in the
          Proposal Queue, in Queue Order:
        (1) its Title;
        (2) its current priority; and
        (3) the date and time when it was Proposed.

      (b) This publication shall also describe any changes to the
          Priorities of the Proposals in the Queue and the reasons
          therefore.  This publication need not contain the text of
          Proposals in the Queue.

167. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
More Sensible Amendment
Numbers

Be it resolved, that Rule 1069 be amended to read:

      (a) Each Rule shall have an Amendment Number.
        (1) The Amendment Number of a new Rule, when that Rule is
            created, is zero.
        (2) The Amendment Number of each Rule existing at the time
            this version of this Rule takes effect is whatever its
            Amendment Number was under the prior version of this Rule;
            if a Rule had no Amendment Number on that version of this
            Rule, its Amendment Number is zero.
        (3) The Amendment Number of a Rule is incremented by one
            whenever a Rule Change affecting that Rule takes place.

      (b) A Rule's Amendment Number shall be displayed in Official
          copies of the Ruleset, appended to the Rule Number, and
|         separated by a forward slash. Responsibility is given to the
|         Rulekeepor to accurately update Amendment Numbers.

      (c) Amendment Numbers may be used for Official purposes and in
          Official documents to distinguish between old versions of a
          Rule and the Rule's current text.

        (7) Duration of Nominations: The Nominating Period lasts for

          Election shall have no Winner. If there is only one

            whom the most votes were cast. If there is more than one

            candidates as the winner, and must announce eir chosen
            candidate as winner to the Public Forum.
        (4) Quorum: Quorum shall be set at 50% of the eligible Voting
            Entities at the beginning of the Voting Period. If a
            smaller fraction voted, the Election has no Winner.

          perform eir required duties, but if the result of an
          Election is not announced within one Week following the end
          of the Voting Period, the Election has no Winner.

      (f) Effective Time of Election Results: The results of an
          Election are effective at the time the results of the
          Referendum are announced; or, if there is no Referendum, at
          the time that the Vote Collector announces that there is to
          be no Referendum.

      (g) Cutoff for Challenges: Any challenge of the correctness of
          the announced results of an Election must be made within
          seven days of the time the results are announced.  If seven

          clearly identify the entity to which the Will is to belong,
          requires the Signature of the Executor of the entity to
          which the Will is to belong, and is Executed by submitting
          it to the Notary.  The effect of Executing such an
          Application is to create a Will belonging to that entity.
          Any prior Will belonging to that entity is destroyed at the
          same time.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Each Organization in existence prior to the adoption of the
          Proposal which created this Rule is deemed to be an
          Organization created under the authority of these Rules, all
          other Rules notwithstanding.  The Charter of each such
          Organization shall be its former SLC, the Agent shall be the
          Adminstrator of its former SLC, and its Membership shall be
          those Players who were within the Jurisdiction of its former

          characteristics set forth above by events occuring after the
          adoption of the Proposal which created this Rule.

      (c) This Rule shall take precedence over every Rule with which

174. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Cleanup of R.1006

Be it resolved, that Rule 1006 be amended to read:

      (a) An Office is any position established by the Rules as such.

      (b) At any time, a given Office is held by exactly one Player.
          If an Office would otherwise not be held by any Player, it
          shall be held by the Speaker.

      (c) An Officer is any Player who holds an Office.

      (d) A given Office has whatever duties, responsibilities, and
          privileges that the Rules assign to it.

[Most of the rest of the current R.1006 is superfluous baggage.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

176. Proposal by Steve, AI=2
A Separation of Powers

This Proposal has an Adoption Index of 2.

[Comment: the basic framework is surprisingly easy to put in place,
because we already have the concepts of a Voting Entity and a Proposing
Entity defined. They seem, and probably were, made to prepare for this
kind of innovation.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rule entitled "Legislators and Voters" be
created with the following text:

      Every Player is either a Legislator or a Voter. By default, every
      Player is a Voter. Newly registered Players are Voters.

      A Legislator has the right to submit Proposals, but may not cast
      votes on Proposals (i.e., e is a Proposing Entity but not a Voting
      Entity). A Voter has the right to cast votes on Proposals, but not
      to submit Proposals (i.e., e is a Voting Entity but not a
      Proposing Entity).

      A Voter may become a Legislator, or a Legislator a Voter, by
      announcing that e is doing so in the Public Forum, provided that
      e has not changed from being a Legislator to being a Voter, or
      vice versa, during the previous two months.

      The Registrar shall record whether each Player is a Legislator or
      a Voter, and the date and time at which e last became either a
      Legislator or a Voter, and include it in eir Registrar's Report.


Be it further resolved that R206 (Voting Entities and Votes) be amended
by deleting the text:

      Players and Groups are Voting Entities.


Be it further resolved that R766 (Groups) be amended by appending to it
a new paragraph which reads:

      Each Group is a Voting Entity.


Be it further resolved that R1605 (Proposing Entities) be amended by
replacing the text:

      Each Player is a Proposing Entity.  Other entities are Proposing
      Entities only if defined as such by the Rules.

with the text:

      A Player or other entity is a Proposing Entity only if defined to
      be so by the Rules.


Be it further resolved that R879 (Quorum) be amended by replacing the
phrase "Active Players" with the phrase "Active Voters".


Be it further resolved that R1873 (A Duty to Vote) be amended by
replacing the phrase "Active Player" with the phrase "Active Voter", and
by deleting the paragraph which reads:

      Three months after this Rule is created, it repeals itself.

      As soon as possible after the end of the Voting Period of a
      given Proposal, the Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity a
      number of Voting Tokens equal to the votes cast on that
      Proposal by that entity multiplied by the voting cost for
      that Proposal.

[Comments:

v1.0:

This occured to me while writing the previous proposal. 

Another way to decide whether a Proposal is "uncontroversial" is
to examine the vote, after the fact. If it passed unanimously, obviously
it must have been uncontroversial.

I like this one more than the previous one. It makes voting for
something you think is going to pass unanimously into a gamble. Also,
"objecting" by voting against, costs something.

Proto: An Alternative to Summary Adoption

Repeal Rule 1883.

Amend Rule 1623 ("Disinterested Proposals") to read:

     A Proposal may be Interested or Disinterested. All Proposals
     are Interested when made. The Proposer of a Proposal may cause
     it to become Disinterested, without objection, but only if the
     Proposal has not yet been distributed.

the text:

      The Batch Size is an integer with a value between two and six
      inclusive, indicating the number of Proposals which will be
      distributed by the Promotor in the following Nomic Week,
      provided that there are that many Proposals in the Queue.
      Unless the Rules give it another value, the Batch Size is five.

      will be distributed by the Promotor in the following Nomic Week,
      provided that there are that many Intereseted Proposals in the 
      Queue. Unless the Rules give it another value, the Batch Size 
      is five.


Amend Rule 1770 ("Distributing Proposals") by replacing the text:

      If the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue with a
      Priority greater than or equal to the Priority Bar is less than
      or equal to the Batch Size, then the batch shall consist of all
      such Proposals.

      Otherwise, the batch shall consist of those Proposals in the
      Queue with the highest Priority such that the number of
      Proposals distributed is equal to the Batch Size.

with:

      If the number of Interested Proposals in the Proposal Queue
      with a Priority greater than or equal to the Priority Bar is
      less than or equal to the Batch Size, then the batch shall 
      consist of all such Proposals.

      Otherwise, the batch shall consist of those Interested 
      Proposals in the Queue with the highest Priority such that the
      number of Proposals distributed is equal to the Batch Size.

      The batch shall also include any Disinterested Proposals 
      currently in the Proposal Queue.


Amend Rule 1442 ("The Cost of Voting") by replacing the text:

      Proposals have a voting cost, equal to the Voting Tariff
      at the time they were distributed. If there was no value
      set for the Voting Tariff at that time, then the voting
      cost is 1 VT.

with:

      Interested Proposals have a voting cost, equal to the Voting
      Tariff at the time they were distributed. If there was no 
      value set for the Voting Tariff at that time, then the voting
      cost is 1 VT. Disinterested Proposals have a voting cost of
      0 VTs.

[Comments:

v1.0:

Okay, so Summary Adoption had its bugs. Still, the principle of free
adoption for uncontroversial proposals is sound. We just need to add
some checks and balances. 

This proposal is based on an idea put forward, I believe, by Macross.
Proposals can be made Disinterested without objection. Disinterested
Proposals get distributed in the next batch, and voting on them is free.
But they still have to pass the vote, so they are not as liable to 
abuse as Summary Adoption was.
