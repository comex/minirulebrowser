                               CFJ 1076

 "The Rule entitled 'A Public Voting Experiment' has not yet been
  given a Rule Number by the Rulekeepor."

======================================================================

Judge:       Morendil
Judgement:

Eligible:    Andre, Blob, Crito, elJefe, General Chaos, Harlequin,
             Kolja A., Michael, Morendil, Murphy, Oerjan, Swann,

Ineligible:
Caller:      Steve
Barred:      Chuck
On request:
On hold:     Vir

======================================================================
History:

  Called by Steve, 15 Dec 1997 14:41:37 +1100
  Assigned to Morendil, as of this message


======================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

Proposal 3555, which enacted 'A Public Voting Experiment', passed on
Oct. 24, 1997. Rulekeepor Chuck subsequently assigned it, or at least
attempted to assign it, the number 1741. This attempt, however, could
not have been successful. The number 1741 was not, as it is required
to be by R1349, the "least integer greater than all other Numbers
previously given to a Rule", for that number had previously been
assigned to the Rule 'Restore Game balance II', enacted by Proposal
3538. It is true that at the time Chuck assigned the number 1741 to
'A Public Voting Experiment', he did not then believe that P3538 had
passed. However, there had been an earlier time during which he had
believed that P3538 had passed, and during that time, he did assign
the Number 1741 to 'Restore Game Balance II'. Although he later came
to believe that P3538 failed and that therefore his assignment of
the Number 1741 to 'Restore game Balance II' had been incorrect,
subsequent events have shown that this initial estimation was the
correct one: P3538 did pass after all, and so Chuck's assignment of
the Number 1741 to 'Restore Game Balance II' was the assignment of a
Rule Number to a Rule. That Number was therefore not available to be
assigned to 'A Public Voting Experiment'. That Rule, as the Statement
alleges, has not yet been given a Number by the Rulekeepor.

Note that this argument does not rely on interpreting the controversial
clause "...including numbers assigned to Rules later determined to
have been incorrectly enacted" in R1349 in any particular way. Given
that P3538 actually did pass after all, 'Restore Game Balance II' was
correctly enacted and so this provision was not triggered.

The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of
a VOC directive was the report published in the PF on 1996/08/13
(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

AFAIK, no Herald's Report has ever been successfully ratified.

2. The following new proposal has been distributed; voting lasts for
one week as of this message.

>>
INP 356 was submitted by Ackanomic.  Voting
lasts for 2 weeks.

-----------------------------------------
 
Create a new rule with the following text,
delimited by double dollar signs:
 
$$
The following rule changes are applied in the order
listed:
 
I. Rule 103 is transmuted to Mutable.
 
II.  Rule 103's text is changed to:
 
"
At any time, there shall be exactly one moderator, who must
be a player of at least one member nomic. The moderator may 
not resign. If the moderator is no longer a player in any member
nomic, e must name a successor who is. Once this is done, the
successor replaces the moderator.
 
The moderator may take a leave of absence, provided e names an
acting moderator in eir stead, who is a player in a member nomic.
If the moderator does not return from eir leave of absence within
30 days, the acting moderator becomes moderator; at the same time
the old moderator is relieved of eir duties.  If the moderator
does return within 30 days, the acting moderator is relieved of
eir duties.
 
While the moderator is on a leave of absence, the term moderator, as
used in all other rules, shall be construed as 'acting moderator'.
 
For the purposes of this rule, 'player' must be a natural person.
"
  
III.  Rule 103 is transmuted to Immutable.
 
IV. Rule 104 is transmuted to Mutable.
 
V. Rule 104 is Repealed.
 
VI.  This rule is Repealed.
$$
<<


Remarks (added by Kolja): At the moment, these rules read

>>
Rule 103/0 (Immutable)

    At any time, there shall be exactly one moderator,
    who must be a player of at least one member nomic.
    The moderator may not resign. If the moderator is no
    longer a player in any member nomic, e must name a
    successor who is. Once this is done, the successor
    replaces the moderator. 

  Initial Immutable Rule 103, Aug 01 1996



Rule 104/0 (Immutable)

    The moderator for the first game shall be Andre. 

  Initial Immutable Rule 104, Aug 01 1996
<<

As this proposal tries to transmute two rules to mutable, a single
vote aganst it will prevent its adoption (IN 110).

IN 204 explicitly allows multiple rule changes in one proposal.

A noble gesture.  However, it is my opinion that even with this
policy, the Frankenstein Mutator presents too much instability for its
continued function to be in the best interest of the Game. 

I might support a revised Mutator which spat out Proposals instead of
Rule Changes.

OFF:  New Proposals: 3642-3649

There are eight new proposals distributed as of this report.

(I still have the Repeal-O-Matic duties to perform, however I'm not comfortable
attempting this until I have a good list of the current Ruleset.  Also, it
seems there should probably be a set of backlog proposals for those weeks when
the Repeal-O-Matic existed without our realizing it.  If it's not too much
trouble, could the Rulekeepor please send me a list of Rule numbers from the
first of those weeks and any additions or deletions for each of the weeks
after.  If that's not convenient, I'll try to dig the info up from the
archives.  Thanks)

======================================================================
Proposal 3642 (G.Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
No Double Penalties for Officers 

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1007 be amended by deleting the
paragraph which begins "If the Rules pertaining...".

[It's truly unfair to Officers to both take away their Salaries _and_
whap them with an Infraction for the same thing.  Especially for the
Assessor, whose primary duty, tabulating Votes, does not yield a
document which must be published once each week.]

======================================================================
Proposal 3643 (G.Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Lowered Quorum

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 879 be amended, by replacing the
text "35% of all Players, or 50% of all the Players not On Hold" with
"one-third of Active Players, or one-fifth of all Players".

======================================================================
Proposal 3644 (G.Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Liberalize Speaker's Patronage 

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1661 be amended, by replacing "for
an amount not in excess of 1 VT" with "for not more than 1 unit of any
one Currency Minted by the Bank."

======================================================================
Proposal 3645 (elJefe)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Late Judgements

Amend Rule 408 to read:

      The Player assigned to Judge a Call for Judgement is required to
      either return a Judgement upon that CFJ or dismiss that CFJ
      within the assigned deliberation period, which ends seven days
      after e is assigned to Judge it.

      Failure to do so is the Infraction of Judging Late, detected
      and reported by the CotC. At the time of the report of infraction,
      if the CFJ has been Judged or dismissed then the penalty is 1 VT
      and the Judgement or dismissal is legal even though delivered
      late.  Otherwise the penalty is 3 Blots, and the Judge becomes
      ineligible to Judge that CFJ, and a new Judge shall be assigned in
      the usual manner.

      A Judge who has neither judged nor dismissed a CFJ within seven
      days after the end of the assigned deliberation period becomes
      ineligible to Judge that CFJ, and any Judgement or Dismissal
      submitted after this time is not legal and shall not be accepted
      by the CotC.

      However, if the Player assigned to Judge a CFJ ceases to be
      eligible before judging or dismissing that CFJ, then e is neither
      required nor permitted to either return a Judgement on, or
      dismiss, that CFJ, and ceases to be the Judge assigned to that CFJ
      at the moment e becomes ineligible.


Amend Rule 591 by deleting the sentence:

      A Judgement returned after the end of the permitted deliberation
      period, or by a Player ineligible to be Judge of that CFJ is not
      legal and shall not be accepted by the Clerk.

and changing the last sentence to read

      A Judge who delivers Judgement on a CFJ before the end of
      the assigned deliberation period shall receive a Judicial
      Salary of 1 VT.


Amend Rule 1565 by deleting the text ", and only when issued by the Judge
within the permitted deliberation period"

and changing the last sentence to read

      A Judge who dismisses a CFJ before the end of the assigned
      deliberation period shall receive a Judicial Salary of 1 VT.


Amend Rule 1447 by changing the last sentence to read

      Each Justice who submits eir determination to the CotC before
      the end of the assigned deliberation period shall receive a
      Judicial Salary of 1 VT each upon the publication of their
      determinations.


{Comments:
1.) The CotC must accept late judgements, provided they reach the CotC
before e reports the Judge for failure to judge.

2.) Late Judgements are penalized (1 VT plus loss of Judicial salary).
However, Judges should not rest easy because the CotC may reassign a
late CFJ without warning, and then the penalty is 3 blots.

3.) The CotC has discretion on when to guillotine the lateness period,
but at most one week.

4.) Omit the troublesome phrase "prior to the end of the permitted
time", from Rule 408. }

======================================================================
Proposal 3646 (elJefe)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Organizational Payment Orders

Create a Rule "Organizational Payment Orders" which reads:

     The Executor of Organization's SLC is empowered to execute Payment
     Orders from the Organization or from any Player within its
     Jurisdiction, but only such Payment Orders as are authorized by the
     SLC.

{Comment:  The ability of Contests and Groups (old Rule 1534) to make
currency transfers from their contestants/members disappeared with
Pragmatic Currencies. Instead we merely have the SLC's power to require
Players to transfer currencies, which anyone can avoid by simply
resigning from the Contest or Group.  This proto restores the ability to
make the transfers happen regardless. }

======================================================================
Proposal 3647 (Swann)  AI = 1
Quorum Tools

Let the following rule be created;
{Title:Quorum Buyback}

     Any Player other than the Assessor is permitted to buyback Quorum 
     on a particular Proposal.  A Player is only permitted to do this
     once for any single Proposal. A Player does this by informing the 
     Assessor that e wishes to buyback Quorum on a specified Proposal. 
     That Player can rescind eir buyback before the end of the voting 
     period by sending a message stating so to the Assessor.

     The effect of a Player's buyback on Quorum (if it is not rescinded) 
     is to reduce the Quorum on the specified Proposal by one.  If
     multiple Players buyback Quorum on a single Proposal, the effect is 
     cumulative.

     At the end of the voting period for that Proposal, the Assessor 
     shall adjust the Quorum for that Proposal by subtracting one for 
     each buyback that was not rescinded.  The Assessor shall then bill 
     each Player whose buyback was not rescinded one P-Note.

     The Assessor is required to maintain the same secrecy about a 
     Player's buyback as e is a Player's Vote.

======================================================================
Proposal 3648 (Swann)  AI = 1
Quorum Tools II

Let the following rule be created;
{Title:Quorum Without Objection}

     The Speaker has the power to, Without Objection, designate any 
     Proposal whose voting period is underway to have achieved Quorum.
     That Proposal shall then have its Quorum adjusted to equal zero.

     This Rule takes precedence over the Rules defining Quorum for
     Proposals.

======================================================================
Proposal 3649 (Swann)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Stylishness

Let the following rule be created;
{Title: Stylishness of Rules}

     Every Rule has associated with it a value known as that Rule's 
     Stylishness.  A Rule's Stylishness shall be an integral value that 
     is positive, negative, or zero.  A Rule with a Stylishness that is 
     positive is a Stylish Rule, a Rule with a Stylishness that is 
     negative is a Dull Rule, a Rule with a Stylishness that is zero is 
     a Generic Rule. Upon the adoption of this Rule all Rules are 
     Generic.
   
     The Wizard shall maintain a record of the Number of each
     non-Generic Rule and its associated Stylishness.  E shall publish
     this record at least once every two weeks.

{Comment: Removed the Rulekeepor from this since a) e has enough work,
          and b) There's no real reason e needs to maintain the 
          information since the Wizard is the one who acts on it.}


Let the following rule be created;
{Title: Changes to Rules' Stylishness}

     Whenever a Proposal is adopted that changed the Proposer's Style, 
     every Rule that the Proposal amended shall have its Stylishness
     change by the same amount, and every Rule that the Proposal created
     shall have its Stylishness set equal to that amount.

     Every week, the Wizard shall randomly select one Generic Rule that 
     does not list the Player currently holding the Office of Wizard in 
     its Attribution.  When the Wizard selects this Rule e shall assign 
     it a new Stylishness based on the same criteria e uses for 
     proposals.  This new Stylishness shall be an integral value between 
     -3 and 3, not including zero.

     When a Rule's Stylishness changes, the Wizard shall record the 
     change and the reason for it.  E is required to publish these 
     changes in the Public Forum as soon as possible after they occur.

{Comment: Again, removed the Rulekeepor from this.}


Let the following rule be created;
{Title: The Style Machine}

     This Rule is known as the Style Machine and may be referred to 
     unambiguously in that manner.  The Executor of the Style Machine is 
     the Wizard.  The Style Machine is a Voting Entity.  Every time the 
     Wizard produces a report listing the Style changes due to
     Proposals, e shall also pay out a number of VTs to the Style
     Machine equal to the number of Proposals in that Report that
     changed their Proposer's Style. The Wizard is only permitted 
     to act on behalf of the Style Machine as explicitly directed in 
     this Rule.

     If the Style Machine possesses VTs, it shall act as follows;
     
       i) If a Proposal amends or repeals more Stylish Rules than Dull 
          Rules the Style Machine shall vote Against that Proposal.
      ii) If a Proposal amends or repeals more Dull Rules than Stylish 
          Rules the Style Machine shall vote For that Proposal.
     iii) If neither i) or ii) apply, the Style Machine shall Abstain on
          that Proposal.

     If the Style Machine does not possess VTs, it shall act as follows;

      iv) If a Proposal amends or repeals more Stylish Rules than Dull 
          Rules the Style Machine shall not declare its Presence for
          that Proposal.
       v) If iv) does not apply, the Style Machine shall declare its 
          Presence on the Proposal.

     The Wizard must report Votes or declarations of Presence for the 
     Style Machine before the end of the Voting Period of the Proposal 
     in question.

     The Style Machine's votes shall count toward Quorum.  The Style 
     Machine's Votes cannot be changed once made.  This Rule takes
     precedence over the Rules covering Voting Entities and Votes in 
     general.

{Comment: This is now only work for the Wizard.  The extra work IMO is 
          offset by a measure of power e receives by modifying the 
          Stylishness of Rules.  The idea being that Stylish Rules are 
          slightly harder to change than Dull Rules.}
