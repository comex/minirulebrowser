Text of Adopted Proposals
======================================================================
Proposal 3758 (Steve) AI = 1
Permit Electioneering!

[Comment: as a companion to my Secret Voting Experiment proto, a
proto to permit Electioneering. This would be proposed at the same
time as 'A Secret Voting Experiment', but would be a separate
Proposal. The idea may seem outrageous, but I think it has merit.
We've been busily giving all kinds of interesting powers to the
Promotor, the Chancellor and the Speaker (and I've just proposed
some for the Accountor, too) - why not give some real power to the
Assessor and the Registrar, and make these Offices *really*
attractive and important?]

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 452 (Prohibit Electioneering by
Vote Collectors) be amended by appending to it a paragraph which
reads:

      This Rule, apart from this paragraph, has no effect. Two
      months after this paragraph is added to this Rule, this
      paragraph shall be deleted from this Rule.

Be it further resolved that Rule 1625 (Secrecy of Voting) be
amended by appending to it a paragraph which reads: 

      This Rule, apart from this paragraph, has no effect. Two
      months after this paragraph is added to this Rule, this
      paragraph shall be deleted from this Rule.

======================================================================
Proposal 3760 (Kolja A.) AI = 1
Avoid inflation, encourage specialization

Create a rule with the title "Officers may not own plots" and the text: 

      If at any time a Player has held an Office in the normal fashion
      without interruption for more than two weeks, ownership of any Plots 
      this Player owned at that time is transferred to the bank. This
      transfer occurs even if other Rules do not allow it.

      As soon as possible after this transfer of ownership the Chancellor
      shall pay out to this Player Nationalization Damages of half
      the Market Value of all Plots transferred to the Bank, and 2 Ergs
      per Structure on these Plots.
