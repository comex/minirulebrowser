1) Scoring Bulletin: Week of the Gambits
Commentary by Dan "The Man" Flanahan and Billy Bob Bullwinkle

Billy Bob: Gee whiz, Dan, things are starting to heat up!
Dan, Well, you said it BB: The First Circle remains close, Blob makes
a move for the win in the Second, while the Third is snooze city,
losing what little interest it had when General Chaos left. Here's
how things stand now:
 
Current Scores (as of this Report)

Dan: Well, Blob's clever ploy has rocketed him to the top of the
standings. He showed good sense by switching to more profitable
point-scoring methods when he ran low on scoring by having
proposals passed.
BB: Watch that alliteration! This is a family show. You're right
about the ol' monocell, though. Meanwhile, Vlad's pathetic attempt
to abuse his position to gain a few points has earned him an ol'
fashioned whuppin'! Not for tryin', mind you, but for failing.
Dan: Well, the question now on everyone's minds is, can Blob keep
his generous lead? There will be those in the First Circle intent
on keeping his score down, for pride's sake.
BB: When I was in Japan I tried some Pride's Sake. Not a pinch on
Jim Beam.
Dan: Well, I think things are beginning to degenerate a bit here.
What's that you're drinking now?
BB: Jes' a little something I call a Green Scamster. I'll give
out the formula next time!

the rules (An Object Lesson), and Blob for creating a Rule whose
number is a multiple of 23 (Zombies, etc.) until I receive
independent confirmation of those events. In addition, Players may
get points for voting FOR Blob's proposal, pending the judgment
on Elysion's vote.

4) Special Feature: Building a Better Economy for Agora
Moderator: Michael Bisquick

MB: Welcome to this special Roundtable discussion on ideas and
plans to build a better economy. Can it be done? How to make it
work? What's in it for the little guy? With me now are: His Holiness,
Pope John-Paul II, Fidel Castro, Bill Gates, and Saddam Hussein.

FC: I tell you now, Senor Bisquick, the fastest way to a strong
economy is to receive Russian aid. If Agora were willing to change to
an all-ruble economy, the entire proletariat would be better off.

BG: How can you say that? The Russian economy is in shambles. No,
Agora must reorganize its structure to promote innovation and
expansion. Then, after it has become a success, it can stifle the
competition. But it must start with it's own in-house resources.

SH: By Allah's teeth, what good are resources if you cannot trade
them? No, Agora must negotiate with the Great Satan for arms and
technical assistance first. It must make sure it has the strength to
defend its rights, or it will find itself as weak as before.

PJP2: I am afraid all of you are wrong. I suggest Agora adopt the
method used to such great effect by the Catholic Church in the past:
The sale of Indulgences.

FC: I disagree with Don Hussein. Agora can do quite well on its own,
if the Players are mobilized in a great effort for National
Production.

PJP2: Well, the elite will do well for themselves. But did not Christ
say "render unto the Bank the things which are the Bank's, and render
unto God the things which are God's"? Or something like that. Taxes
must be equitable for all.

BG: Sorry, Popester, but I have to disagree. Look, I'm willing to
consider a deal to bundle the Agora mailing list into Windows, IF I
can get full ownership of the game.

SH: Patience is the watchword. Soon your enemies will come to you
looking for opportunities. To act before you are truly ready, that is
the biggest mistake.

MB: Are we still talking about the economy? Anyway, we are out of
time. I thank our panelists for not killing one another.

black bean soup diet!
