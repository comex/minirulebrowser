OFF:  New Proposals: 3597-3599

There are three new proposals distributed as of this report.

======================================================================
D = Disinterested
d = Disowned
S = Silly
E = Emergency
 
D  3597 Andre    1 Blot Amnesty Extension
D  3598 Morendil 1 Finish Amnesty
D  3599 elJefe   1 Clarify probate for Groups

======================================================================
Proposal 3597 (Andre)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Blot Amnesty Extension 

All former Players who have Fugitive Blots have their number of Fugitive
Blots decreased to zero.

[Explanation: All Players have had their Blots removed. Why not do the
same to those who happen to have (been) deregistered?]

======================================================================
Proposal 3598 (Morendil)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Finish Amnesty

Enact a Rule with the following text :

      Upon the creation of this Rule, all persons with Fugitive Blots
      shall have all Fugitive Blots removed from them. Further, the
      Herald shall vacate all due Payment Orders for Indulgences 
      which have been executed under the authority of Rule 1473.
      Immediately after e has done so, this Rule repeals itself.

======================================================================
Proposal 3599 (elJefe)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Clarify probate for Groups

Amend Rule 1637 (Wills) to read:

      A Will is an SLC.  The Jurisdiction of a Will is always empty.
      Each Will belongs to exactly one entity.  The Notary
      shall be the Maintainer of all Wills.

      A Will shall specify the heirs of the entity to which it
      belongs, and how the currencies possessed by that entity and
      its other assets will be divided amongst those heirs when that
      treasury is placed in Probate.  When an entity's Will is
      executed, the Executor in Probate of that entity will first
      submit all the Transfer Orders required by the Will (excepting
      those which e cannot execute or cannot execute successfully, for
      whatever reason), and will then divide the remaining residual
      assets as provided by the Will.

      A Will is created or amended by the Execution of an Application
      to Create a Will.  Such an Application must clearly identify the
      entity to which the Will is to belong, requires the
      Signature of the Executor of the entity to which the Will is
      to belong, and is Executed by submitting it to the
      Notary.  The effect of Executing such an Application is to
      create a Will belonging to that entity.  Any prior Will
      belonging to that entity is destroyed at the same time.

      A Will belonging to an Organization is not an SLC associated to
      that Organization, as defined elsewhere.

{ Comments: Avoids the phrase "associated with" which also occurs in the
definition of Organizations; replaces it with "belongs to" which fits 
well with the concept of it being the "Entity's" will.  Appends a 
clarifying sentence to make sure.  Fixes a typo in the original Rule. }

Agora Nomic
Ambassador's Report

Date of this Report: 10 Nov 1997

======================================================================
Diplomatic Report


Contents:

1. INP 349 adopted

2. INP 350: Agora referendum result; we vote FOR

3. Life on other planets


1. INP 349

INP 349 has been adopted with the FOR-votes of Ackanomic and
Internomic. Agora abstained from the vote because our referendum on
this proposal was undecided.

The adopted proposal,

> Ammend R215 by replacing the string "Rishonomic" with the string "New
> Rishonnomic"

contains two typos (aMMend and RishoNNomic). There are no provisions
in the IN rules that determine how typos are to be dealt with. The
only relevant sentence I can find is from IN rule 108,

    If adopted, it [the proposal] shall take effect in the form in
    which it was voted on.  

While the moderator has changed IN 215 to include New RishoNNomic, in
eir message to the IN list e also asked for comments. My personal
opinion is that the proposal does nothing, because "aMMend" is not
defined. However, I'm only going to say this on the IN list as a
personal opinion; if I get response from any of you, I'd also like to
pass on something like an opinion of Agora as a whole. If you like,
you can also try to formulate an appropriate SFJ to Internomic (see
Agora rule 1635). 


2. INP 350

The Agora referendum on INP 350 ended Sat, 08 Nov 1997 14:57:45
-0400. At the beginning of the voting period for this referendum there
were 17 active players (I think), so quorum is 5. I received votes as
follows:

Andre:      PRESENT

Crito:      FOR

Kolja A.:   PRESENT

Scott:      PRESENT

Steve:      PRESENT

Swann:      FOR

Quorum is met, and Agora will vote FOR this proposal.


3. Life on other planets

The following mail was sent to several email nomics, including ours,
by one Berry.Renken@hunze.iwg.nl:

>>
 Hello guys,

 I'm running a Nomic game via my E-mail gaming zine (game & discussion 
 newsletter) "The Bluesmobile" and was wondering if and how contact can be
 established between the various E-mailable 'Nomic planets' (about 20 in 
 number, as far as I'm aware). All and any reactions to this are very 
 welcome.


 All the best,

 Berry Renken
 Diever, the Netherlands
<<

Steve already responded briefly on our behalf. Anyone else willing is
invited to do so, too.

--------------

Date: Tue, 4 Nov 1997 05:03:14 +1100

    In accordance with R1743, Herald Crito reports all previously unreported
    Infractions of Persistent Indebtedness (to the best of eir knowledge) and
    then vacates all outstanding Indulgence POs.

Date: Wed, 5 Nov 1997 01:57:39 +1100

    Herald Crito issues a COE on the above report of PI Infractions and admits
    said COE.  This has the effect of negating the validity of outstanding PO
    vacations mentioned in the previous entry, since the conditions for R1743
    were not met.  At the same time, Herald Crito reports the corrected
    information for unreported PI Infractions.

Date: Wed, 5 Nov 1997 14:06:06 +1100

    TO Kolja, in recognition of his fine Judgement in CFJ 1065.

The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of
a VOC directive was the report published in the PF on 1996/08/13
(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

AFAIK, no Herald's Report has ever been successfully ratified.

More Interesting Proposal Mechanisms

Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Proposal Applications}

     There is a type of Application known as an Proposal Application.  
     Such an Application is executed by submitting it to the Promotor.  
     This application takes effect when executed.  For a Proposal 
     Application to take effect it must;

       i) Indicate it is a Proposal Application
      ii) Include the text of a single Proposal, clearly indicated as 
          such.
     iii) Specify the non-player entity which the Rules shall deem to 
          have submitted the included Proposal.  This entity cannot be 
          an entity defined elsewhere in the Rules as a Proposing 
          Entity.
      iv) Include the signature of the Executor of the non-player entity 
          specified in iii) above. (A Proposal Application may never be 
          executed on behalf of an entity with no Executor.)
       v) Include the signature of at least one other Player.

     If all the above conditions are met, the Application will be 
     executed upon its receipt by the Promotor.  The effect of the 
     Application is to temporarily designate the non-Player entity 
     specified in the Application as a Proposing Entity, and to submit 
     the included Proposal on behalf of that entity.  For the purpose of 
     the Rules governing Proposals, the included Proposal shall be 
     deemed to have been submitted when the Application was executed.  
     Immediately after this submission, the entity will cease being a 
     Proposing Entity.  (Losing this designation will not change the 
     identity of the Proposer, it will remain the non-Player entity 
     specified in the Application.)

{Comment: This allows Groups, Contests, and any entity with an Executor
          to make a proposal.  I've always been interested in allowing
          the possibility of Groups to propose legislation.  This also
          allows an easier method for group authorship of Rules rather
          than direct fiddling with the Attributions.  All you need is
          to create a contest called "Me & Him Inc." and submit your
          Proposal Application.}

=======================================================================
1. CHANGES IN STYLE
=======================================================================

3579 G. Chaos   Stranded Currencies
Style: no change

Minor tweak.

3580 G. Chaos   Improper Transfers
Style: no change

Minor tweak.

3581 Oerjan     Exorcise Probate
Style: no change

An important tweak, but my Style-detectors remain limp.

3582 Swann      Repeal-O-Matic
Style: +2

Radical, fun, no way it'll pass. I like the fact that the Rule has an
Executor.

3583 Swann      Repeals Without Objection
Style: +1

Totally weird. *Absolutely* no way it'll pass.

3584 Swann      Free-for-All
Style: no change

I'm luke-warm.

3585 Kolja A.   (untitled)
Style: +1

Abolish P-Notes? I like!

3586 Vlad       Pardons
Style: +2

A nice toy for the CotC, if e ever gets to use it.

3587 Vlad       Reduce Frivolous Appeals
Style: -2

Frivolous Appeals are a non-problem. This 'cure' is much worse than
the purported 'disease' it's trying to cure. IMHO.

3588 Vlad       We Don' Need No Stinking Game Custom!
Style: no change

I'm undecided about the merits of this idea, but at any rate, changing
two words in a Rule is rarely going to be Stylish.

3589 Vlad       Sunset Stare Decisis
Style: -1

Hey! I like Stare Decisis!

*** Vlad is awarded the Patent Title of Boor. ***

3590 Swann      The Internomic Encouragement Act
Style: no change

Ho hum.

3591 Andre      Repeal Pitchfork
Style: no change

Fat trimming. No Style in that.

3592 Andre      Remove Silliness
Style: no change

Ditto.

3593 Andre      InterNomic Proposal cleanup
Style: +1

Neatly done.

3594 Andre      Shorten InterNomic Voting Period
Style: no change

Minor tweak.

3595 Andre      Liaison? Which Liaison?
Style: no change

Minor tweak.

3596 Kolja A.   (untitled)
Style: no change

Thank god, but still no Style. Tee hee.

3597 Andre      Blot Amnesty Extension
Style: no change

Will this work? Will it not run into to same problems that beset RGB I?

3598 Morendil   Finish Amnesty
Style: -1

Oerjan says this is faulty. I trust him.

*** Morendil is awarded the Patent Title of Boor. ***

3599 elJefe     Clarify probate for Groups
Style: no change

Minor tweaking.

3600 Swann      More Interesting Proposal Mechanisms
Style: +1

Yes, I guess it is slightly interesting.
