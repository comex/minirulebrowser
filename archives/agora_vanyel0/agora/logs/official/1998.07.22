Text of Adopted Proposals
======================================================================
Proposal 3768 (Chuck) AI = 1
Some Omnibus-Reform Related Fixes

I request that this Proposal have AI=1.


Rule 789 ("Orders to Annotate Rules") is amended by changing the
text which currently reads:

      The Rulekeepor may remove such an annotation only if that Rule
      is repealed, or when required to do so by a valid Order.

to read:

      The Rulekeepor may remove such an annotation only if that
      Rule is repealed; if required to do so by a valid Order;
      or if the original Order to annotate is amended, stayed, or
      vacated.  The Rulekeepor may vacate an Order to annotate
      a Rule Without Objection.

Rule 1500 ("Orders to Annotate SLCs") is amended by changing the
text which currently reads:

      The Maintainer of that SLC may remove such an annotation only
      when the SLC ceases to exist, or when required to do so by a
      valid Order.

to read:

      The Maintainer of that SLC may remove such an annotation only
      if the SLC ceases to exist; if required to do so by a valid
      Order; or if the original Order to Annotate is amended, stayed,
      or vacated.  The Maintainer of an SLC may vacate an Order to
      annotate that SLC Without Objection.

[Comments: The OR amendment got rid of the list of Relevant Rules,
which means that if an interpretation is critically dependent on
a Rule other than the one being annotated, it may persist after
that Rule is amended, even if it should not.  Allowing the
annotation to be removed Without Objection will allow such
annotations to be removed without a court order.

Also clarifies that if an order to annotation is amended, stayed,
or vacated, the Rulekeepor/Maintainer need not continue to
supply the original annotation.]


Rule 1829 ("Refusal of Duty by the Speaker") is amended to read:

      If the Speaker is convicted of the Crime of Contempt by
      Inaction, relating to a validly issued Order to Compel which was
      directed at the position of Speaker, the Speaker becomes
      Tainted.

[Comments: Despite what R1829 currently says, an Impossible
Speaker is *not* defined elsewhere.  This corrects that.  Also,
it limits the relevant orders to compel to those incurred *as
Speaker*--the current version of 1829 would allow penalties
against the Speaker for orders to compel which applied to
the Speaker, but were not directed to the position of Speaker.]


Rule 1795 ("Timing Requirements of Orders") is amended by
changing the text which currently reads:

      An Order which commands the performance of an action may specify
      when that action is to be performed; if no specification is
      given, or if the specification given would require the
      performance of the action at a time when the Order is without
      effect, the Order shall be taken to require the performance of
      the action as soon as possible after the Order takes effect.

to read:

      An Order which commands the performance of an action may specify
      when that action is to be performed; if no specification is
      given, or the the specification given would require the
      performance of the action at a time when the Order is without
      effect, or if the specification given would allow less than
      72 hours from the time when the Order takes effect to perform
      the action, then the Order shall be taken to require the
      performance of the action as soon as possible after the Order
      takes effect.

      If an Order which commands the performance of an action is
      directed to an Office or other position of authority, and the
      holder of that position of authority changes after the Order
      takes effect, but before the Order is satisfied, and the
      specification would require the performance of the action at a
      time before the current holder of the position came to hold
      that position, or would allow less than 72 hours from the time
      the current holder of the position came to hold that position,
      then the Order shall be taken to require the performance of the
      action as soon as possible after the current holder of the
      position came to hold that position.  However, this shall
      not be taken to absolve the previous holder of the position
      of any penalties e might otherwise incur.

[Comments: Sets a minimum of 3 days to perform any action required
by Order.  Also allows a reasonble time for new Office-holders
to satisfy requirements of Orders.]


Rule 1814 ("Timing of Penalties for Crimes and Infractions")
is amended by appending a sentence which reads:

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which specifies
      a different penalty for a Crime or Infraction.

[Comments: Rule 1814 tries to specify that the penalty for
a Crime or Infraction is the one that applied at the time
the Crime or Infraction was committed, but lacks the necessary
precedence clause to make it work as intended.]


Rule 1798 ("I Was Only Obeying Orders") is amended to read:

      A Player who performs as required by an Order which is later
      found to be invalid shall not be convicted of a Crime, nor
      penalized by being billed, being removed from or retired
      from Office, becoming Tainted, or being deregistered,
      solely as a result of performing as required by the Order.
      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would cause
      the Player to be convicted of a Crime or penalized, as
      described, for said action.

[Comments: Clarifies what 1798 currently means by "is not liable
for".  Adds a necessary precedence clause.]


A Rule shall be created with the following text:

      As soon as possible after creation of this Rule, Chuck shall
      vacate all unsatisfied Payment Orders for Indulgences naming him
      as Payor.  He is both authorized and empowered to do this.  Once
      that has taken place, this Rule repeals itself.

   3772 Swann          1 Repeal a Pointless Rule

Style Changes
=======================================================================

   3772 Swann          1 Repeal a Pointless Rule 

Style Change: -1

Repealing a rule and creating a new one in its place is bad form.

   3773 Swann          1 We Know when the ROM Submits the @#$!% Proposal 

Style Change: 0

Removing an ugly phrase is probably worth 0.5 Style Points, but is not 
enough to warrant a whole point.

   3774 Crito          1 Making On Hold Safe Again

Style Change: 0

A bit wordy, but not enough to warrant a penalty.
