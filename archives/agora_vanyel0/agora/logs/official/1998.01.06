No Rule requires or prohibits that I disclose which entities have Wills, or
anything about a Will's text.  I do so solely for informational purposes.

All of the Wills marked (*) have ceased to exist for various reasons, and
are listed solely for historical purposes.

4. PROBATE REPORT
=============================================================

No Rule requires or prohibits that I disclose the identities of Trustees,
except at the time I assign them.  I do so solely for informational purposes.

I am not certain whether all these entities are in Probate; I am
particularly uncertain about Morendil, due to events that took place
in the latter months of 1997.

                               CFJ 1078

     "Morendil violated Rule 1729 by voting on Proposal 3640 in the
      Public Forum."

======================================================================

Judge:       Blob
Judgement:

Eligible:    Blob, Crito, elJefe, Gen Chaos, Harlequin, Kieron,
             Kolja A., Michael, Morendil, Murphy, Oerjan, Steve, Swann


Ineligible:
Caller:
Barred:
On request:  Chuck (thru 11 Jan)
On hold:     Andre, Vir


======================================================================
Requested Injunction:

I remind the Judge that if e Judges this CFJ TRUE, Rule 908 will
be applicable.


======================================================================
History:

  Called by Steve, 6 Jan 1998 13:34:49 +1100
  Assigned to Blob, as of this message


======================================================================
Caller's Arguments:


Firstly the facts. These are as follows:

Proposal 3640 was an Insane Proposal. R1729 ('Insanity') states that:

      For such a Proposal, until the Voting Period has ended:
      there shall be no discussing Votes, or this Rule has been
         bended.
      Nor shall a Player Vote in public, only to Assessor.
      The Votes shall be unknown to others, even employer and
         professor.

On Thu, 18 Dec 1997 10:55:40 +0100, Morendil sent a message to the
Public Forum voting on P3640. In a message dated Tue, 23 Dec 1997
13:57:25 +0100, and also sent to the Public Forum, Morendil
subsequently retracted these votes (see the Evidence attached for
both messages).

There are a number of points I think it worth bringing to the attention
of the Judge. Firstly, the matter of the Public Voting Experiment. R1749,
in force at the time, stated that:

      Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
      any votes by Voting Entities on Proposals, Elections or
      Referenda, may only be achieved by sending a message to the
      Public Forum.

Was there a conflict between Rules 1729 and 1749, a conflict which
R1749 would have won in virtue of its precedence claim? I argue that
there was no conflict. R1749 made it impossible to vote without
sending a message to the PF; R1729 merely makes it illegal to vote by
sending a message to the PF. The result is clear and achieved without
conflict between the Rules: no Player could legally vote on P3640. A
Player could, however, vote illegally on P3640 by sending a message
to the PF, violating the stricture in R1729 that Players shall not
vote in public on Insane Proposals. This is what I argue Morendil did.

Secondly, we can quickly dismiss the matter of R1729's use of the
word 'bended'. Although it is an interesting question whether there
is a distinction recognized by Agoran law between breaking the rules
and merely bending them, that question is not relevant here. The
'bending' of R1729 arises in reference to the *discussion* of votes
on Insane Proposals, not the act of voting itself. As far as that
act is concerned, R1729 is crystal clear in prohibiting public
voting on Insane Proposals, when it says "Nor shall a Player vote
in public, only to Assessor. / The Votes shall be unknown to others,
even employer and professor."

Finally, there is the question of Morendil's retraction of his
votes. Does this save him from having violated R1729? I do not
think so. I argue that the Rules can distinguish between a case in
which a Player first votes and then retracts his vote, and a case
in which a Player does not vote at all. The fact that Morendil
subsequently retracted his vote does not make it any less true that
he had earlier voted, in violation of R1729.
