  Appeal begins, as of this message
======================================================================

Judgement: FALSE

Reaons and arguments:

The orders that Swann believes e disobeyed were issued by Player
Macross in the same message as e registered as a Player. I believe
that Player Macross did not hold office and e was not a Judge, and was
not on the board of appeals at the time e issued the Orders. Since
Macross did not hold office and e was not a Judge, and was not the
Board of Appeals, eir Orders were private as per Rule 1794/0.  Since
they were Private Orders, they are executed by submission directly to
the Player to be commanded, as per Rule 1808/0.  Since these were
submitted to the Public Forum rather than directly to Player Swann,
these orders were never executed and never took effect.  It is not
required that Players obey Orders not in effect, therefore Player
Swann could not have disobeyed orders.  Therefore e never committed
the crime of Contempt by Action as defined in Rule 1811/0.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

I believe that Macross' Orders were valid, and when I published the
message entitled "No New Player Tyranny"-- either through accident or
excessive enthusiasm-- I violated Rule 1811 and committed a Class C
Crime.  I plead no contest and will not appeal the Judge's verdict on
the matter. I only hope is that the Agora public will recognize this as
a genuine accident and not a willful and hypocritical flouting of the
principles I've been wont to expouse.

======================================================================

Judgement: TRUE

Reasons and arguments:

The question is not new to me; the practice of making oneself
ineligible to judge all CFJs called in a certain period of time has
always struck me as against the letter of rule 1567. This never
bothered me very much, as I think it is nice to have this
possibility. I consider this an interesting example where game custom
quietly accepted a practice that is against the letter of a rule; I
think that a challenge of such custom in a CFJ is enough reason to
change it and go back to the rules proper.

I hope, however, that noone will advocate changes in past CFJ
assignments that respected ineligibilities illegal under this
CFJ. Anyone who thinks about doing so should have formally challenged
the practice when it was begun.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

I begin with the general observation that being eligible to Judge a
CFJ is a Nomic property of Players in the sense of R1011, and hence
can only be changed by procedures specified in the Rules. Hence if the
procedure described in R1567 for changing one's eligibility to Judge a
CFJ does not permit Players to make themselves ineligible to Judge
CFJs which have not yet been called (as I contend), then, since no
other Rule specifies such a procedure, that action is simply not
permitted by the Rules at all, and the Statement is TRUE.

The first paragraph of R1567 itself states that:

      A Player makes emself ineligible to be the Judge of a specific
      CFJ by transmitting a notice to the Clerk of the Courts,
      specifying the CFJ for which e wishes to be made ineligible.

Attention should be drawn here to two points about this paragraph. The
first is that it describes a procedure for making oneself ineligible
to Judge 'a specific CFJ'. The second point is that the procedure
described requires the the Player to specify 'the CFJ for which e
wishes to be made ineligible'. I submit that a CFJ which has not yet
been called and hence does not yet exist cannot meet the requirements
of specificity in R1567. "All CFJs called in the next two weeks" does
not name a specific CFJ, for example. Neither does "Any CFJ called by
Chuck in the next month." Even "Any CFJ called by Chuck in the next
three days concerning the interpretation of Rule 1567" does not, I
claim, name a specific CFJ, even if Chuck actually makes a CFJ
matching that description. 'A specific CFJ' can only refer to a CFJ
which already exists in the full particularity of its details: its
text, who called it, and when it was called.

(Caller's) Arguments:

>From Rule 1859:
      Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
      any votes, or the declaration of Presence, by Voting Entities
      on Proposals, Elections or Referenda, may only be achieved by
      sending a message to the Vote Collector of the Proposal,
      Election, or Referendum only. (Players are, however, permitted
      to send or copy such messages to themselves.)

This clearly prevents a message to the Public Forum from effecting a
Vote.
