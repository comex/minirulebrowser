The Scorekeepor's Report Round 1, Week 7
 
In this issue of TSR:

Due to RL events, this will be an abridged report. We will return you
to your regularly scheduled program next week. Not much has happened
recently anyway.

Also, there was an error in the last report, as I forgot to list
Beefarino...um....Beefurabbi as a new member of the Third Circle with
zero points. Please note the correction.

Scorekeepor's Update, by Vlad
Recent Scoring Changes
 
Scoring from passing Proposals
Apr 27: Oerjan (10)

Scoring from Voting with 80% majority
Apr 27: Crito (2), Blob (1), Oerjan (1), Michael (1), Murphy (2),
Elysion (1)


Note: I have presently omitted scoring for: Steve getting his name in
the rules (An Object Lesson), and Blob for creating a Rule whose
number is a multiple of 23 (Zombies, etc.) until I receive
independent confirmation of those events. I have also omitted any
points for my proposal passing or for my voting, until it is
determined that I could, in fact, vote.

Team Report: There are no teams.




Coming next week: Coming soon to a theater near you: The Agora Movie!
