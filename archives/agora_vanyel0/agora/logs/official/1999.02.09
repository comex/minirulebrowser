==========================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

Kolja granted me his Power of Attorney commencing on 01 Feb 1999 00:00
GMT, about five and a half hours before Proposals 3829-3830 were
distributed (at Mon, 01 Feb 1999 00:36:00 -0500, according to the
Assessor's Report of the results).

Now, R1842 states that:

      When the Holder is granted Power of Attorney for the Grantor, that
      means that the Holder becomes the sole Executor for the Grantor
      for as long as e has that Power of Attorney.

So while I hold Kolja's Power of Attorney, I am Kolja's sole Executor.
In particular, this means that Kolja is not his own Executor, and is
therefore incapable of executing Transfer Orders, at least of a kind
which the Recordkeepor is required to record (see R1817). According to
the definition of "effective control of an asset" in R1873,

      Effective control of an asset (e.g., a unit of Currency) is the
      ability to dispose of that asset as one wishes.

But Kolja manifestly cannot dispose of his assets as he wishes while I
hold his Power of Attorney, for he cannot dispose of his assets at all;
only I can do so, as his sole Executor. Hence Kolja did not have
effective control of any assets whatsoever when Proposals 3829-3830 were
distributed, and could not have incurred a Duty to Vote on those
Proposals.

==========================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

At 20:22:57 EST on 2/7, I (as Promotor) erroneously attempted to
distribute a Proposal called 'The Grand Agoran Tournament' as Proposal
3830.  Since that number had already been used for another Proposal,
such distribution was invalid.  I discovered and announced my error at
20:51:49 EST, about a half-hour later, and distributed the same
Proposal as Proposal 3833 at 21:03:24 EST.

Vlad was aware of my error at as of 00:06:13 EST on 2/8, because he
claimed that the redistribution was in error.  Notwithstanding his
awareness of an error, he proceeded to cast eir votes at 00:11:01 EST.
It seems obvious that Vlad was aware, or should have been aware, that
there was an irregularity in the distribution.

In any case, at the time Vlad cast his votes, there were two Proposals
which a reasonable person might understand to be "Proposal 3830",
although legally only Blob's "Actions with N Supporters" Proposal
bears that number.  Vlad's reference to Proposal 3830 in his Votring
message was therefore ambiguous; hence, his message fails to
successfully communicate to the Assessor which Proposal e is
attempting to cast Votes upon.  Assessor Blob erred in counting these
Votes.

Since the miscounting of Vlad's Votes does not affect the outcome of
Proposal 3830, the only corrective action require is to vacate Payment
Orders avt083 and avt085, and I hereby move the Judge to do so.

Respectfully submitted,

General Chaos

==========================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

I use the term "3830" to denote the Proposal G. Chaos tried to
distribute with Proposals 3831 and 3832 in his message of 7 Feb., which
he marked with the designation 3830, entitled "The Grand Agoran
Tournament". This message fit all the requirements for distribution,
except that of having been given an official number as required by 109.
However, by 1770, such omission does not affect the legality of the
Proposal's distribution. Therefore, Proposal "3830" was distributed, but
without a number as required by 109 (I will hereafter refer to this as
the "109 number".

Now, the second issue, is whether "3830" does currently have a 109
number, namely, 3833. G. Chaos is correct that an Officer does not have
to issue a COE to correct his own report; by CFJ 919 any correction is
to be considered a COE and a response. The question is, has G. Chaos
issued such a correction? No. He proceeded to redistribute Proposal
"3830" a second time, giving this second issue the number of 3833.
Nowhere in the redistribution did he indicate that this was a correction
of his previous message. Can we consider this an implicit corection? No.
The correction required was the assignment of a 109 number to the
already distributed Proposal "3830". However, G. Chaos' messages to the
PF indicate that he felt "3830" had in fact not been distributed at all,
and that 3833 was a seperate distribution. In fact, now we know that it
was the second distribution of the Proposal. So the correction, viz. the
assignment of a 109 number to "3830", has never occurred.

I also request the Judge issue an Order to Compel to General Chaos
requiring him to assign Proposal "3830" a number as required by Rule
109.

==========================================================================
Documentation attached by Caller:

Text of Rule 109:
Rule 109/3 (Power=2)
Proposal Numbers

      At the time e distributes it, the Promotor shall give each
      Proposal a Number for reference.  The Number of a Proposal shall
      be the least integer greater than all other Numbers previously
      assigned to a Proposal (including numbers assigned to Proposals
      later determined to have been incorrectly submitted), or 301,
      whichever is greater.

@@@@@@@

Text of Rule 1770:
Rule 1770/2 (Power=1)
Distributing Proposals

      Each week, the Promotor shall distribute a batch of Proposals.
      These are the only Proposals e is allowed to distribute that
      week.

      If the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue with a
      Priority greater than zero is less than or equal to the Batch
      Size, then the batch shall consist of all such Proposals.

      If the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue is greater
      than the Batch Size, then the batch shall consist of those
      Proposals in the Queue with the highest Priority such that the
      number of Proposals distributed is equal to the Batch Size.

      Once a Proposal is distributed, it is removed from the Proposal
      Queue.

      The Promotor shall distribute each proposal in the batch to the
      Public Forum, accompanied by its Number and the identity of
      its Proposing Entity.

      The failure of the Promotor to distribute any of the above
      accompaniments with a Proposal does not deprive the
      distribution of the Proposal of any legal effect.

      A Proposal is only considered to be legally distributed if it
      is explicitly marked as such. The Promotor is permitted to
      publish the text of undistributed Proposals without necessarily
      distributing them.

Upon reviewing the Rules, it appears to me to appear that Vlad's
Proposal has not yet been distributed, and the other two have.
While the Rules require that I distribute only the Proposals in the
Batch, it does not say that I have to distribute them all at one
time.  Therefore, I will distribute Vlad's Proposal separately as
Proposal 3833 in a few minutes.  My apologies for the confusion.

(It also says that I don't have to distribute the Proposals in the
batch in any particular order.  Hm.)

                               CFJ 1122

  Proposal "3833" (see below) was not properly distributed and is not in
  fact currently up for vote.

  Called by Vlad:                          Mon, 8 Feb 1999 18:51:00 -0600
  Assigned to Michael:                     as of this message

==========================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

By "3833" I mean the Proposal G. Chaos tried to distribute
by itself in his message of 7 Feb., entitled "The Grand Agoran
Tournament" and given the designation 3833. As another CFJ made by
me will determine, Proposal "3833" was in fact distributed earlier,
although at the time of this CFJ it has not been given an official
number. The distribution of "3833" was illegal because at the time
G. Chaos attempted to distribute it, there was no such Proposal in
the queue (it having already been distributed), and a number of
Proposals equal to the batch size had already been distributed
(namely the aforementioned unnumbered Proposal, 3831 and 3832.).
Therefore, G. Chaos had no authority to make such a distribution.

==========================================================================
Documentation attached by Caller:

Text of Rule 1770:
Rule 1770/2 (Power=1)
Distributing Proposals

      Each week, the Promotor shall distribute a batch of Proposals.
      These are the only Proposals e is allowed to distribute that
      week.

      If the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue with a
      Priority greater than zero is less than or equal to the Batch
      Size, then the batch shall consist of all such Proposals.

      If the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue is greater
      than the Batch Size, then the batch shall consist of those
      Proposals in the Queue with the highest Priority such that the
      number of Proposals distributed is equal to the Batch Size.

      Once a Proposal is distributed, it is removed from the Proposal
      Queue.

      The Promotor shall distribute each proposal in the batch to the
      Public Forum, accompanied by its Number and the identity of
      its Proposing Entity.

      The failure of the Promotor to distribute any of the above
      accompaniments with a Proposal does not deprive the
      distribution of the Proposal of any legal effect.

      A Proposal is only considered to be legally distributed if it
      is explicitly marked as such. The Promotor is permitted to
      publish the text of undistributed Proposals without necessarily
      distributing them.
