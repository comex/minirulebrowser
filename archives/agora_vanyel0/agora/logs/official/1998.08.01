I hereby order the Bank to pay lee 1VT as his judicial salary.  I
further order the Scorekeepor to note that lee gains 3 points for
judging a CFJ. 

======================================================================
                               CFJ 1100

  Player Swann committed the crime of Contempt by Action.

======================================================================

Judge:        lee

Judgement:    FALSE

Eligible:     Blob, Chuck, Crito, General Chaos, Kolja A., lee,
              Macross, Michael, Morendil, Murphy, Oerjan, Steve

Not eligible:
Caller:       Swann
Barred:       -
Disqualified: Antimatter, Harlequin (by request)
On hold:      elJefe, Swann

======================================================================

History:
  Called by Swann, Fri, 22 May 1998 11:57:05 -0400
  Assigned to lee, Mon, 27 Jul 1998 09:45:07 +0100
  Judged FALSE, Thu, 30 Jul 1998 23:00:34 -0500
  Published, as of this message

======================================================================

Judgement: FALSE

Reaons and arguments:

The orders that Swann believes e disobeyed were issued by Player
Macross in the same message as e registered as a Player. I believe
that Player Macross did not hold office and e was not a Judge, and was
not on the board of appeals at the time e issued the Orders. Since
Macross did not hold office and e was not a Judge, and was not the
Board of Appeals, eir Orders were private as per Rule 1794/0.  Since
they were Private Orders, they are executed by submission directly to
the Player to be commanded, as per Rule 1808/0.  Since these were
submitted to the Public Forum rather than directly to Player Swann,
these orders were never executed and never took effect.  It is not
required that Players obey Orders not in effect, therefore Player
Swann could not have disobeyed orders.  Therefore e never committed
the crime of Contempt by Action as defined in Rule 1811/0.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

I believe that Macross' Orders were valid, and when I published the
message entitled "No New Player Tyranny"-- either through accident or
excessive enthusiasm-- I violated Rule 1811 and committed a Class C
Crime.  I plead no contest and will not appeal the Judge's verdict on
the matter. I only hope is that the Agora public will recognize this as
a genuine accident and not a willful and hypocritical flouting of the
principles I've been wont to expouse.
