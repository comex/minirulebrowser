======================================================================
Text of Adopted Proposals
======================================================================
Proposal 3755 (Crito) AI = 1
Fix Transfer Orders

Amend Rule 1799 by replacing the text:

      Any Order may always be amended, stayed, or vacated by the
      Player (or, in the case of Appellate Orders, Board of Appeal)
      who executed it.

with the text:

      Any Order, except a Transfer Order, may always be amended, stayed,
      or vacated by the Player (or, in the case of Appellate Orders,
      Board of Appeal) who executed it.  A Delayed Transfer Order may be
      amended, stayed or vacated by the Player who executed it only
      during the time in which it is delayed.

Amend Rule 1598 by appending the sentence:

      If a Transfer Order purports to satisfy a particular Payment Order
      and either that Payment Order does not exist or cannot be
      satisfied by the Transfer Order, then the Transfer Order is
      invalid.

======================================================================
Proposal 3756 (Steve) AI = 1
No Presence

[Comment: the other idea I've had to increase VT expenditure, apart
from secret voting, is the regularly raised idea of getting rid of
Presence. In conjunction with secret voting, this might be especially
effective, since secret voting would make the tactic of not voting on
a Proposal you dislike much more dangerous. As with my other Proposals
in this area, what I propose is a two month trial.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 1715 (Announcing One's Presence) be
amended by appending to it a paragraph which reads:

      This Rule, apart from this paragraph, has no effect. Two
      months after this paragraph is added to this Rule, this
      paragraph shall be deleted from this Rule.

======================================================================
Proposal 3757 (Steve) AI = 1
A Secret Voting Experiment

[Comment: I can think of couple of ways to encourage expenditure
of VTs above the minimum required to pass a Proposal. Here's one
of them: secret voting. If Players can't be sure if a Proposal
they like has met Quorum and has at least 3 supporters, they'll
have to think harder about supporting it themselves. (And similarly
for Proposals they don't like.) We've had 6 months of public voting,
and it's been interesting and fun, but maybe a couple of months of
secret voting might be equally interesting and fun! Anyway, the
approach I've taken here is the same as that which I took when
introducing the Public Voting Experiment back in November of last
year: a 2 month trial with a built-in sunset clause. If secret
voting doesn't have the effect of increasing VT expenditure, or
if it has other effects we don't like, we just let the trial period
expire and go back to our current system.]

Be it hereby resolved that R1764 (Public Voting) be amended by
appending to it a paragraph which reads:

      This Rule, apart from this paragraph, shall have no effect.
      Two months after this paragraph is added to this Rule, this
      paragraph shall be deleted from this Rule.

Be it further resolved that Rule entitled "Secret Voting" be
created with the following text:

      Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
      any votes, or the declaration of Presence, by Voting Entities
      on Proposals, Elections or Referenda, may only be achieved by
      sending a message to the Vote Collector of the Proposal,
      Election, or Referendum only. (Players are, however, permitted
      to send or copy such messages to themselves.) 

      A Player who sends a message containing votes on a Proposal,
      Election or Referendum to the Public Forum, prior to the
      conclusion of the Voting Period of that Proposal, Election, or
      Referendum, commits the Infraction of Public Voting. The
      commission of this Infraction is to be detected and reported by
      the Vote Collector; the penalty is 1 Voting Token and 1 Blot.

      Two months after it is created, this Rule repeals itself.
