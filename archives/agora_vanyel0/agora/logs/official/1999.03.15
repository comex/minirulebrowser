  Decision of Board published:             as of this message

==========================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

At 20:22:57 EST on 2/7, I (as Promotor) erroneously attempted to
distribute a Proposal called 'The Grand Agoran Tournament' as Proposal
3830.  Since that number had already been used for another Proposal,
such distribution was invalid.  I discovered and announced my error at
20:51:49 EST, about a half-hour later, and distributed the same
Proposal as Proposal 3833 at 21:03:24 EST.

Vlad was aware of my error at as of 00:06:13 EST on 2/8, because he
claimed that the redistribution was in error.  Notwithstanding his
awareness of an error, he proceeded to cast eir votes at 00:11:01 EST.
It seems obvious that Vlad was aware, or should have been aware, that
there was an irregularity in the distribution.

In any case, at the time Vlad cast his votes, there were two Proposals
which a reasonable person might understand to be "Proposal 3830",
although legally only Blob's "Actions with N Supporters" Proposal
bears that number.  Vlad's reference to Proposal 3830 in his Votring
message was therefore ambiguous; hence, his message fails to
successfully communicate to the Assessor which Proposal e is
attempting to cast Votes upon.  Assessor Blob erred in counting these
Votes.

Since the miscounting of Vlad's Votes does not affect the outcome of
Proposal 3830, the only corrective action require is to vacate Payment
Orders avt083 and avt085, and I hereby move the Judge to do so.

Respectfully submitted,

General Chaos

==========================================================================
Judge Morendil's Arguments:

The message referred to in the Statement read as follows :

========================================
From:             Scott de Brestian <c647100@showme.missouri.edu>
Subject:          BUS: Votes on 3830-3832

I hereby cast the following votes:

Proposal 3830: FOR x 2
Proposal 3831: Present
Proposal 3832: Present
========================================

Notwithstanding the Caller's argument, I find that at the time Vlad
posted eir Voting message there did in fact exist one Proposal with
the number 3830, namely Blob's "Actions with N Supporters", the
Voting Period of which was still ongoing.

I am unconvinced by the Caller's contention that the above message
'fail[ed] to successfully communicate to the Assessor which Proposal
e [was] attempting to cast Votes upon'. The Rules do not mandate
that a message purporting to contain a Vote should unambiguously
express the voting Player's intent; all that they require is that
such a message clearly identify an existing Proposal, the Voting
Period of which is underway, which was the case.

I therefore enter a Judgement of FALSE.

==========================================================================
Speaker Murphy's Arguments:

I find the original Judgement incorrect, and move to overturn it.

At the time Vlad posted eir Voting message, exactly one Proposal
numbered 3830 (Blob's "Actions with N Supporters") had been distributed.
However, another Proposal (Vlad's "The Grand Agoran Tournament") had
also been distributed at that time, and could reasonably be referred to
as "Proposal 3830" even though such a reference was not sanctioned by
the Rules.

Vlad's Voting message did not clearly identify one or the other of these
Proposals, so did not satisfy the requirements for a Voting message to
be effective.

There is also the issue of the Judge's denial of the Motion requested by
the Caller.  I cannot find any provision for Appealing the handling of a
Motion.  However, it appears that the Board of Appeals may execute
anything whatsoever as an Appellate Order, by majority agreement.  Is
this the intended mechanism for allowing the handling of a Motion to be
overturned?

I state for the record that I would support an Appellate Order requiring
the vacation of Payment Orders avt083 and avt085, should one be issued.

==========================================================================
CotC Steve's Arguments:

I find to my surprise that none of the Caller, G. Chaos, the original
Judge, Morendil, or Speaker Murphy (who has already delivered his
Appellate Judgement to overturn) have addressed in their arguments what
I consider to be the central issue of this CFJ, that is, the scope of
discretionary powers of the Assessor in counting ambiguously cast votes.

In Morendil's case this is perhaps more understandable, since it his
view that the ambiguity of Vlad's voting message is legally irrelevant
to the case. It was his contention that:

      The Rules do not mandate that a message purporting to contain a
      Vote should unambiguously express the voting Player's intent; all
      that they require is that such a message clearly identify an
      existing Proposal, the Voting Period of which is underway, which
      was the case.

However, I do not see on what Morendil bases this view. The only Rule
which speaks to the legality of casting votes on a Proposal (in the
sense which is of interest here) is R683, which says only that:

      A Voting Entity votes upon a Proposal when, during the Voting
      Period of that Proposal, e informs the Assessor of the vote or
      votes e is casting upon that Proposal, provided that e is
      authorized to cast those votes on that Proposal.

But the Rules are silent on the issue of the clarity with which "that
Proposal" must be identified in a voting message. In my view, General
Chaos and Speaker Murphy were therefore mistaken when they asserted
that Assessor Blob erred in counting Vlad's votes because Vlad's voting
message did not clearly identify which Proposal he was voting on. I
accept, as they do, that Vlad's voting message was ambiguous. But there
is no requirement for clear identification in R683.

In the absence of such a requirement, we are led to an examination of
the discretionary powers of the Assessor in such a situation. I can find
nothing in the Rules which requires the Assessor to reject ambiguously
cast votes, nor anything which prohibits the Assessor from exercising
his discretion to resolve the ambiguity as e thinks is proper, although
naturally the Assessor would want to think about how his action might be
viewed in the light of R1665 (Abuse of Responsibility). I view Assessor
Blob's decision to count Vlad's votes as he did as the exercise of such
a discretionary power, and it seems to me that he was within his rights.
In saying that, I am not saying anything one way or the other about
whether Blob was guilty of Abuse of Responsibility, since that is a
matter I have not been asked to adjudicate upon. I am only saying Blob
was legally entitled to act as he did.

However, since this line of reasoning has not been considered so far, I
thnk it would be wise to place the CFJ before a new Judge who can
consider its worth.

I therefore OVERTURN Morendil's Judgement, and call for the CFJ to be
re-assigned.

==========================================================================
Justiciar Crito's Arguments:

/verbose on

There are several issues that I feel need to be addressed in this case.

The first concerns the meaning of "legal significance".  Before this CFJ
I had taken a rather simplistic view of this phrase, but now I see that
there can be at least two different categories of "legal significance"
within Agora.  One is the very strict category of items that have "legal
significance" as explicitly defined by the Rules.  Another is the rather
loose category of items that have "legal significance" by virtue of
their relationship to entities defined by the Rules.  The case at hand
provides an excellent example for this distinction, namely,
appellations. The official proposal number is an appellation directly
defined by the Rules and therefore has legal significance of the strict
kind. However, there is nothing that prevents a proposer or Promotor
from associating another appellation with a Proposal which can then take
on legal significance of the looser kind, since this appellation can be
used by Players to cause changes in the game state (i.e. by using it to
cast votes).

If we were to disallow anything to have legal significance other than
the strict kind, Morendil's judgement would be without question correct.
Only one Proposal had the strictly legal designation of 3830 and by
referring to that number in eir post, Vlad, intending it or not, could
only be referring to the original P3830.  However, I think we have
strong game custom, as well as the best interests of the game, in
considering the second, looser form of legal significance to be valid.
When Promotor G.Chaos attempted to reassign 3830 to the new proposal, e
temporarily created an appellation for P3833 that was identical to the
official appellation of P3830.  Of course, at this point 3830 became
ambiguous as to which Proposal it actually referred. This brings us to
the second issue - what is the significance of an ambiguous voting
message?

Unfortunately, the Rules are less clear here than I would like.  R683
does not explicitly say that a Player's vote must unambiguously refer to
a particular Proposal.  It merely says that a Player votes on a Proposal
when e informs the Assessor that e is voting on "that Proposal".  I see
three possible interpretations when the reference to a Proposal is
ambiguous:

1.  The voting message actually cast a vote on *both* Proposals.
2.  The voting message is invalid, since it does not specify explicitly
    what "that Proposal" is.
3.  The Assessor resolves the ambiguity, or invalidates the message
    at eir own discretion.

The more I think about it, the more I am inclined to believe that the
strict letter of the law would require interpretation 1.  However, I
also think that this is a case where it is unambigously clear that
Vlad's intention was to cast a single vote on a single Proposal, and so
I am inclined to take this into account and discard option 1.  That is
to say, Vlad clearly only cast one vote and the Rules do not allow a
single vote to be split between more than one Proposal.

Although I think 2 may be a reasonable interpretation (and indeed has
been argued as such by others), I am not yet convinced that it carries
more weight than interpretation 3.  And, since it gives me the chance
to set some legal precedent (or maybe at least spark some interesting
debate), I will focus my decision on this interpretation.

Clearly, Assessor Blob operated under interpretation 3 in determining
that the ambiguity should be resolved  by strictly adhering to the
letter of the law regarding Proposal numbers. (This, of course, assumes
you accept the argument that there *was* ambiguity in the message.  At
the time of eir actions, I suspect Blob did not think so, but that is
irrelevant). Assuming that Blob was within eir right to do this, what
then is the role of the Courts in this case?

One might say that since the Rules did not prevent Blob from exercising
eir own judgement in resolving an ambiguity, we should just let it stand
and live with it.  But I think Players should have a reasonable recourse
against such determinations that work to their detriment.  So, I will
take this opportunity to either establish new or add to existing
precedent that the role of the Courts is to review such actions and to
uphold or rectify them (as much as possible).  It is my opinion that the
Courts should not overturn such actions unless there is compelling
reason to do so.  In this case, I think there are such compelling
reasons because, IMO, it is in the best interests of the game that:

    a) Players should be able to operate under the reasonable assumption
       that official reports and announcements are correct.  In other
       words, although it is their right to double-check and question
       the validity of official messages, it should not be a
       *requirement* to do so.

    b) As much as possible, errors made by one Player should not
       irreversibly negatively impact other Players.

To accept Blob's actions as Assessor in this case would run counter to
both of the above principles.  Since the outcome of this analysis leads
to the same conclusion has accepting interpretation 2, I will leave
arguments in it's favor in the hands of the other Justices.

/verbose off

Therefore, I hereby vote to overturn Morendil's judgement and return a
judgement of TRUE.
