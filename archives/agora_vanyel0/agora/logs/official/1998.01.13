to Cartographor Michael, 1 VT
to Chancellor General Chaos, 1 VT
to Clerk of the Courts elJefe, 2 VTs

to Promotor Crito, 1.5 VTs
to Registrar Michael, 1.5 VTs

Steve does not receive a salary as Archivist because he has not been
in Office for long enough. 

I hereby order the Bank to pay Steve 1 VT in recognition of his
services to the game as Distributor.

I hereby order General Chaos to pay the Bank 2 VTs and 2 Indulgences
for committing the Infraction of Failure to Report in his role as
Wizard.  (The current ruleset lists R1505 as being infected, but this
is an error, as the infection took place on 23 December.)

(That's a COE on the ruleset by the way Chuck.)

Michael.
