3. WILL REPORT
=============================================================

No Rule requires or prohibits that I disclose which entities have Wills, or
anything about a Will's text.  I do so solely for informational purposes.

Summaries of Wills are not guaranteed to be accurate.

All of the Wills marked (*) have ceased to exist for various reasons, and
are listed solely for historical purposes.

4. PROBATE REPORT

No Rule requires or prohibits that I disclose the identities of
Executors in Probate, except at the time I assign them.  I do so
solely for informational purposes.

Swann is not in Probate.  Others (notably Morendil) may also not be in Probate.

=============================================================
5. FRANKENSTEIN MONSTER REPORT

Required by the Frankenstein Rule.

No Frankenstein Monster has an Administrator or SLC (and thus no FM has a
Maintainer or Jurisdiction of its SLC).  Each Player's Executor is emself;
no other Frankenstein Monster has an Executor.
