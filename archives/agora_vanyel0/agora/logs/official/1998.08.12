   3781 Blob           1 Use it or lose it.

Style Change: -2

Not very well thought through: firstly it requires the Assessor to keep
track of who has and hasn't voted in the last month, which is tedious,
and secondly, if someone hasn't voted for the last month, then they're
not very likely to mind not being allowed to vote for another 2 weeks.

   3782 Steve          1 Extend the ban on Presence

Style Change: 0

Proposed by the Wizard.

   3783 Blob           1 The Voting Tariff

Style Change: +1

I'm not sure what its effect will be, but it's an interesting idea.

   3784 Steve          1 Get Rid of 4 Offices

Style Change: 0

Proposed by the Wizard.

Text of Adopted Proposals
======================================================================
Proposal 3779 (Blob) AI = 1
Skimming a bit off the top.

Amend rule 1449 ("The Assessor") to read:

      There shall exist the Office of Assessor.  The Assessor
      shall receive a weekly salary equal to 0.5 times the Basic
      Officer Salary.

      The Assessor shall also receive a Commission. At the end
      of the Voting Period for a Proposal, the Assessor shall
      pay out to emself an amount equal to 5% of the VTs spent
      on voting on that Proposal.

======================================================================
Proposal 3780 (Steve) AI = 1
Extend the Secret Voting Experiment

[Comment: The secret voting experiment seems to be working reasonably
well. I'd like to extend it another two months. Note that this quite
independent of the issue of Presence.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rules 452 (Prohibit Electioneering by Vote
Collectors), 1625 (Secrecy of Votes) and 1764 (Public Voting) each be
amended by appending to them a paragraph which reads:

      This Rule, apart from this paragraph, has no effect. Two months
      after this paragraph is added to this Rule, this paragraph shall
      be deleted from this Rule.

Be it further resolved that R1859 (Secret Voting), be amended by
replacing in it the paragraph which currently reads:

      Two months after it is created, this Rule repeals itself.

with a paragraph which reads:

      Two months after this paragraph is added to this Rule, this Rule
      repeals itself.
