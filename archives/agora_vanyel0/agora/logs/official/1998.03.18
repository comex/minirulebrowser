Text of Adopted Proposals
======================================================================
Proposal 3698 (Kolja A.)  AI = 1
Buying points

Create a new rule with the Title "Buying points" and the text:

     Player may pay currencies to gain points. To do this, a player 
     must transfer the price for these points to the bank. This transfer
     may not have any other purpose. The price for any one point may
     only be paid using one single currency. As soon as possible after
     the transfer of the price, the Recordkeepor of the currency with
     which the price was paid must order the corresponding Points
     gain for the player who paid the price. 
   
     The price for one Point can be one of the following: one
     indulgence, three P-notes or three VTs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal 3704 (Gen Chaos)  AI = 1
The Omnibus Reform Act of 1998

Title I: Orders

Chapter 1: Definition ------------------------------------------------

Be it therefore resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      An Order is a command, executed by a Player and directed to some
      entity requiring that entity to perform exactly one action, or
      to refrain from performing one or more actions.  

      An Order may be directed to the holder of an Office or other
      official position in eir capacity as that Office or other
      official position, and in this case if the Office or position
      changes hands before the Order is satisfied, the duty to abide
      by the Order automatically attaches to the new holder of that
      Office or position.  

      Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Order, the purpose of which is
      to affect the operation of a prior Order, is as valid as any
      other Order, and is said to be directed at the prior Order it
      affects.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      There are four classes of Order: Administrative, Judicial,
      Appellate, and Private.  

      A Judicial Order is an Order executed by a Player while acting
      as a Judge.

      An Appellate Order is an Order executed by a Board of Appeals.

      An Administrative Order is an Order executed by the holder of an
      Office or other official position (such as the Speaker or the
      Recordkeepor of a Currency) other than that of a Judge or
      Justice, in the course of performing the duties of that Office
      or position.

      A Private Order is any other sort of Order.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      An Order which commands the performance of an action may specify
      when that action is to be performed; if no specification is
      given, or if the specification given would require the
      performance of the action at a time when the Order is without
      effect, the Order shall be taken to require the performance of
      the action as soon as possible after the Order takes effect.

      This Rule defers to any Rule which establishes regulations
      relating to the performance of duties required by various sorts
      of Orders, and only establishes the time by which an Order must
      be performed.  The noncompliance of an Order with this Rule does
      not deprive that Order of all effect, but instead modifies the
      effect of that Order with respect to the time at which or by
      which the actions it requires must be performed.
      
Chapter 2: Validity of Orders ----------------------------------------

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      All Orders executed in the manner prescribed by the Rules for
      their class and type are presumed valid and enforceable until
      proven otherwise by CFJ.  

      In order to be proven valid by CFJ, the Rules must permit the
      Player who executed the Order in question to execute such an
      Order, that the execution of the Order must have been required
      by or permitted in the circumstances which existed at the time
      it was executed, and that the Order has not been rendered
      invalid by the operation of any other Rule.

      Furthermore, no Order may act to prevent or hinder its own
      appeal in any way, and any portion of an Order which has this
      effect is void and without force.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      Knowingly and willfully executing invalid Orders constitutes the
      Class B Crime of Abuse of Authority.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      A Player who performs as required by an Order which is later
      found to be invalid is not liable for eir actions; but other
      Rules may establish procedures for correcting or remedying
      such circumstances when they occur.

Chapter 3: Amendment, Stay, and Vacation of Orders -------------------

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      Any Order may always be amended, stayed, or vacated by the
      Player (or, in the case of Appellate Orders, Board of Appeal)
      who executed it.  Certain classes of Orders may be amended,
      stayed, or vacated in other circumstances as well, when the
      Rules so allow.  In all cases, this is done by an Order to
      Amend, Stay, or Vacate, respectively, the original Order.

      Otherwise, an Order shall not be amended, stayed, vacated, or
      otherwise changed once executed.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      The effect of amending an Order is to cause it to be effective
      in its amended form.  The prior form of the Order ceases to have
      effect upon the amendment, and the new form has effect as if it
      had been originally executed in that form at the moment the
      amendment becomes effective.  

      Vacating an Order to Amend has the same effect as would an Order
      to Amend reinstating the previous form of the Order.

      Amending a stayed or vacated Order does not grant the stayed or
      vacated Order effect it would otherwise not have.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      The effect of staying an Order is to temporarily deny the stayed
      Order from having any effect.  

      A stay may be ordered for a fixed time, in which case the stay
      expires at the time specified; or for an indefinite time, in
      which case the stay will not expire.  If no specification is
      made in the Order to Stay, the stay shall be indefinite.  

      When the stay expires or is vacated, the previously stayed order
      again has effect as if it had been originally executed at the
      moment the stay ceases to be effective.  However, if at the time
      the staying Order expires or otherwise ceases to have effect,
      the stayed Order has been vacated or is subject to another
      staying Order, it does not regain effect.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      The effect of vacating an Order is to permanently deny the
      vacated Order from having any effect.  Vacating an Order to
      Vacate reinstates the ability of the vacated Order to have
      effect, as of the moment the Order to Vacate is itself vacated.

Chapter 4: Judicial Orders -------------------------------------------

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:
      
      Judicial Orders are executed by being sent to the Clerk of the
      Courts, but do not take effect until their publication by the
      Clerk of the Courts.  The Clerk of the Courts shall publish each
      Judicial Order as soon as possible after receiving it from the
      Judge who executed it.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:      

      Judicial Orders are subject to appeal to a Board of Appeal by a
      Call for Appeal.  

      The Board of Appeal shall, upon finding that a Judicial Order is
      improperly or invalidly executed, order that that Order be
      amended or vacated, as it deems appropriate.  

      When the Clerk of the Courts receives a properly executed Call
      for Appeal of a Judicial Order, the Clerk of the Courts shall
      stay the Order under appeal.  If the Board of Appeals affirms
      the validity of the original Order, it shall then vacate this
      stay.

Chapter 5: Appellate Orders ------------------------------------------

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      Appellate Orders are executed by being sent to the Clerk of the
      Courts by the Lead Justice of a Board of Appeals, but do not
      take effect until their publication by the Clerk of the Courts.
      The Lead Justice shall certify in eir submission to the Clerk of
      the Courts that the Order is executed by the concurrence of the
      majority of the Justices comprising that Board of Appeals;
      failure to do so deprives the Order of effect.  

      The Clerk of the Courts shall publish each Appellate Order as
      soon as possible after receiving it from the Board of Appeal
      which executed it.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      Appellate Orders are not subject to appeal.  However, upon a
      judicial finding that the required certification was falsely
      provided, the Justiciar shall vacate the Order which was
      accompanied by that false certification.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      Since Appellate Orders cannot be appealed, Appellate Orders are
      valid only if addressed to:
        a) The Clerk of the Courts in eir Official capacity;
        b) an Order issued by the Clerk of the Courts in eir Official
           Capacity; 
        c) The Judge of the CFJ which that Board of Appeals was
           convened to consider, or any Order issued by that Judge in
           that particular CFJ; or
        d) any combination of the above.

      All other Appellate Orders are presumptively invalid.  

      This Rule takes precedence over all Rules pertaining to the
      validity of Appellate Orders.

Chapter 6: Administrative and Private Orders -------------------------

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      Administrative Orders are executed by being published in the
      Public Forum, and take effect upon publication.

      Private Orders are executed by submitting them directly to the
      Player to be commanded, and take effect upon submission.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      Both Administrative and Private Orders are subject to appeal by
      a CFJ, the statement of which Statement alleges that the Order
      is improperly or invalidly executed.  

      Upon a judicial finding that an Administrative or Private Order
      was improperly or invalidly executed, the Judge so finding shall
      vacate that Order.  

      When the Clerk of the Courts receives a properly executed Call
      for Judgement, the statement of which alleges that an
      Administrative or Private Order was improperly or invalidly
      executed, the Clerk of the Courts shall stay the Order in
      dispute.  If the Judge affirms the validity of the original
      Order, e shall then vacate this stay.

Chapter 7: Noncompliance with Orders ---------------------------------

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      An Order is satisfied when the action which it requires to be
      performed is performed by the entity it requires to perform it.
      (Only Orders which require an entity to perform an action can be
      satisfied.)  Any entity who is required by an Order to perform
      an act who fails to perform the required action prior to the
      time specified in the Order commits the Crime of Contempt by
      Inaction, a Class C Crime.

      Except when otherwise specified, a single action can result in
      the satisifaction of at most one Order.  If an action would
      satisfy more than one Order, and no other specification is made,
      the Action satisfies the oldest Order which it would satisfy.

      This Rule shall have no application with respect to any Order
      which has been adjudicated to be invalid, and the invalidity of
      the Order is a complete defense to a Criminal accusation made
      under this Rule.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      Any entity who, while required by an Order to refrain from
      performing an action, performs the proscribed action while the
      Order is in effect commits the Crime of Contempt by Action, a
      Class C Crime.

      This Rule shall have no application with respect to any Order
      which has been adjudicated to be invalid, and the invalidity of
      the Order is a complete defense to a Criminal accusation made
      under this Rule.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1551 be amended, by replacing
"Injunction" with "Order".

Be it further resolved, that Rules 663, 1571, and 1573 be repealed.
[Judicial Orders cover everything that Injunctions cover.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Title II: Crimes, Infractions, and Criminal Judicial Procedure

Chapter 1: Crimes ----------------------------------------------------

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1503 be amended to read:

      Any entity who performs an action defined by the Rules to be a
      Crime, or fails to perform an action where such failure is
      defined by the Rules to be a Crime, shall be subject to whatever
      penalty the Rules prescribe for that Crime upon the execution of
      a Sentencing Order executed consequent to a judicial finding
      that e did in fact commit that Crime.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1504 be amended to read:

      The imposition of penalties for the commission of a Crime shall
      be by Sentencing Order(s).  Upon a judicial finding that an
      entity has committed a Crime, the Judge so finding shall execute
      Sentencing Orders sufficient to implement the penalty required
      by the Rules for that Crime.

Chapter 2: Infractions -----------------------------------------------

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      Any entity who performs an action defined by the Rules to be an
      Infraction, or fails to perform an action where such failure is
      defined by the Rules to be an Infraction, shall be subject to
      whatever penalty the Rules prescribe for that Infraction upon a
      Notice of Infraction stating that e committed that Infraction.

      A Notice of Infraction stating that an entity has committed a
      specific Infraction consists of a report by a Player authorized
      to report instances of that specific Infraction that it is eir
      informed belief that the specified entity has committed the
      specified Infraction.  A Notice of Infraction shall also specify
      the penalty to be imposed for that Infraction.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      The imposition of penalties for the commission of an Infraction
      shall be by the execution of a Notice of Infraction.  The Player
      executing the Notice of Infraction shall, at the time e does so,
      also execute Orders sufficient to implement the penalty required
      by the Rules for that Infraction.

Chapter 3: Restrictions on Interpretation ----------------------------

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:
      
      The punishment for a Crime or Infraction shall be whatever was
      specified by the Rules at the time the action so designated as a
      Crime or an Infraction was committed, even if the Rule or Rules
      which specified the punishment, or which designated the action
      as a Crime or Infraction, have since been amended or repealed.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      No action is a Crime or an Infraction unless defined as such by
      the Rules.  If the Rules define an act to be a Crime or an
      Infraction, but fail to prescribe a penalty for that act, then
      there is no penalty for that act.  If the Rules define an act to
      be an Infraction, but fail to authorize any Player or Players to
      report instances of that Infraction, then that Infraction cannot
      be reported.

Chapter 4: Protection against Double Jeopardy ------------------------

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1652 be amended to read:

      No entity shall be subject to penalties more than once for a
      single instance of a particular Crime or Infraction, any other
      Rule notwithstanding.

      This Rule in no way bars the imposition of multiple penalties
      for the same act (or failure to act) if such action (or
      inaction) constitutes multiple Crimes, multiple Infractions, or
      any combination thereof.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      Any CFJ whose Statement alleges that an entity has, through
      action or inaction, committed a Crime shall be dismissed if
      there is a prior CFJ, the statement of which alleges that the
      same entity has, through the same action or inaction, committed
      the same Crime, and which was itself not dismissed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Title III: Currencies

Chapter 1: Transfer Orders -------------------------------------------

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1598 be amended to read:

      A Transfer Order is an Order requiring the Recordkeepor of a
      Currency to note the transfer of units of that Currency from one
      entity to another.  A valid Transfer Order specifies exactly one
      source entity, exactly one destination entity, exactly one
      Currency, and a number of units of that Currency which is a
      positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      A Recordkeepor is required to abide by all valid Transfer Orders
      submitted by the Executor of the owner of the units of Currency
      to be transferred (or, with respect to any entity which lacks an
      Executor, by any other person empowered by the Rules to execute
      Transfer Orders on the behalf of such entities), except for
      those transfers which would result in an entity possessing a
      negative quantity of Currency.  Transfers shall be noted on the
      Recordkeepor's records in the order in which they are received
      by the Recordkeepor.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      If a Recordkeepor notes a transfer pursuant to a Transfer Order
      which is subsequently vacated, e shall correct eir records as
      soon as possible after the Transfer Order is vacated by noting a
      transfer which is the reverse of the transfer originally noted.
      However, if such a reversing transfer would result in an entity
      possessing a negative quantity of units of Currency, e shall
      instead execute a Payment Order requiring a Transfer Order that
      would have the same effect as the reversing transfer.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      The effect of noting a transfer on the records of the
      Recordkeepor is to remove the specified number of units of
      Currency from the holdings of the source entity and to add the
      specified number of units of Currency to the holdings of the
      destination entity.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      Each Recordkeepor shall maintain a record of all Transfer Orders
      submitted which specify the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor, for at least four weeks after their submission,
      and a complete record of all transfers noted upon eir records
      for at least four weeks.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1730 be amended to read:

      The Recordkeepor of a Currency may, at eir discretion, elect to
      refuse any Transfer Order which requires em to note a transfer
      at any time other than as soon as possible after the Order
      itself became effective.  The Recordkeepor's election to refuse
      an Transfer Order in this fashion renders invalid that Order
      provided that the Recordkeepor sends a message to the Player who
      executed the Order informing him of eir election, within seven
      days of the receipt of that Order.

      This Rule does not apply to Transfer Orders which are required
      by the Rules to be executed with a specification that the
      transfer be noted at a time other than as soon as possible after
      they become effective.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1746 be repealed.  [Rule 1746 is
redundant; a CFJ alleging that a Transfer Order is illegal would, if
found true, result in the vacation of that Transfer Order, which would
then trigger a reversing transfer or Payment Order under the revised
Rule 1598, above.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1731 be repealed.  [Implicit
Transfer Orders are a pain, and exist only to support Voting.  The
conversion to paying for Votes after the fact eliminates the need for
this.]

Chapter 2: Payment Orders --------------------------------------------

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1596 be amended to read:

      A Payment Order is an Order requiring an entity (the payor) to
      submit a Transfer Order transferring units of a Currency from
      itself to some other entity (the payee).  A Payment Order
      specifies exactly one source entity, exactly one destination
      entity, exactly one Currency, and a number of units of that
      Currency which is a positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      A Payment Order is only valid if a copy has been filed with the
      Recordkeepor of the Currency specified in it, and takes effect
      no sooner than the time of such filing.  (Publishing the Payment
      Order in the Public Forum is sufficient to meet this
      requirement.)

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      Each Recordkeepor shall maintain a record of all Payment Orders
      filed with em which specify the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor.  This record shall also indicate, for each Order,
      if that Order has been satisfied, vacated, or both.  However,
      the Recordkeepor need only maintain records of satisfied or
      vacated Orders for four weeks after they have been satisfied or
      vacated.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1599 be amended to read:

      Whenever a Rule requires a Player to execute a Payment Order, e
      shall do so within seven days of when the requirement arises.

[Rule 1599 is almost wholly redundant; the failure to execute a
Payment Order falls within the scope of the amended Rule 1509.]

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      If a Player is required to execute two or more Payment Orders,
      all of which name the same Payor, Payee, and Currency, that
      Player may elect to instead execute one Payment Order naming
      that Payor, Payee and Currency, and for an amount equal to the
      sum of all such Payment Orders required.  Doing so satisfies by
      substitution the requirement to execute all such Payment Orders.

      This Rule may not be applied with respect to any Payment Order
      required consequent to the vacation or stay of another Payment
      Order or of a Transfer Order.

      Payment Orders to be executed for the purpose of paying for
      Voting upon Proposals may not be combined by this Rule with
      Payment Orders executed for any other purpose.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1734 be amended to read:

      When a satisfied Payment Order is vacated, the Recordkeepor of
      the Currency named in that Payment Order shall execute a new
      Payment Order identical to the vacated Payment Order, but with
      the payor and payee interchanged.

      If the Order vacating the original Payment Order is subsequently
      stayed or vacated, then the Recordkeepor shall stay or vacate,
      respectively, the reversing Order required by this Rule.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1736 be repealed.  [Rule 1736 is
redundant; a Judge's Order to pay Currency is a Payment Order in its
own right.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1737 be repealed.  [Rule 1737 is
redundant; Payment Orders are Orders subject to appeal according to
the processes detailed above and can be vacated directly according to
those procedures.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1733 be repealed.  [The automatic
stay of Orders under CFJ renders Rule 1733 effectively redundant.]

Chapter 3: Debt ------------------------------------------------------

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1713 be amended to read:

      An Overdue Payment Order is a Payment Order which is presently
      effective, has been effective for more than seven days, and has
      not been satisfied.

      The Executor of an entity for which, at the beginning of a given
      Nomic week, there is at least one Overdue Payment Order naming
      it as Payor commits the Infraction of Persistent Indebtedness at
      the beginning of that Week.  If an entity has more than one
      Overdue Payment Order naming it as payor, its Executor commits
      as many such Infractions are there are different Currencies
      named in all these Overdue Payment Orders.

      The Recordkeepor of each Currency is authorized to report this
      Infraction with respect to the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor.  This Infraction carries a penalty of one Blot.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Title IV: Voting

Chapter 1: General Procedure -----------------------------------------

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1442 be amended to read:

      A Voting Entity Votes upon a Proposal when e, during the Voting
      Period of that Proposal, informs the Assessor of the Vote (or
      Votes) e is casting upon that Proposal.

      A Voting Entity may specify that e casts no Votes on a Proposal,
      and doing so cancels any previously Votes cast on that Proposal
      (if done during the Voting Period of that Proposal).  Cancelled
      Votes are not counted by the Assessor and do not count toward
      Quorum.

      As soon as possible after the end of the Voting Period of a
      given Proposal, the Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity a
      number of VTs equal to the cost of the Votes cast on that
      Proposal by that entity.  

Chapter 2: Debt Voting -----------------------------------------------

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      An entity for which, at the beginning of a given Nomic week,
      there is at least one Overdue Payment Order naming it as Payor
      which was executed originally for the purpose of paying for
      Voting upon Proposals commits the Infraction of Debt Voting.
      This Infraction shall be reported by the Recordkeepor for Voting
      Tokens, and shall bear the penalty of the denial of Voting
      Privileges for a period of two weeks.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      A penalty denying Voting Privileges to an entity for a period of
      time shall be imposed by ordering the Assessor to deny Voting
      Privilege to the named Voting Entity for that period of time.
      The denial of Voting Privilege begins with the beginning of the
      first full Nomic Week after the Order takes effect, and
      continues for the period specified.
 
      While the Assessor is ordered to deny Voting Privilege to a
      Voting Entity, that Voting Entity shall be entitled to cast no
      Votes on any Proposal, any other Rule to the contrary
      notwithstanding.

      Any period of time during which an Order denying Voting
      Privilege is without effect does not count toward the period of
      denial.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Title V: Judicial Procedure

Chapter 1: Motions ---------------------------------------------------

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      A Motion is a formal request made by a Player to the Judge of a
      CFJ.

      A Motion is made by submitting it to the Clerk of the Courts,
      clearly identifying the CFJ to which the Motion applies.

      The Clerk of the Courts shall forward each properly-filed Motion
      to the Judge of the CFJ to which the Motion applies as soon as
      possible after receiving it.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      A Judge must either grant or deny each Motion forwarded to em by
      the Clerk of the Courts, within five days of when the Motion was
      received by the Judge.  E may, but need not, state the reasons
      for eir grant or denial.  A Judge grants or denies a Motion by
      sending eir determination on that Motion to the Clerk of the
      Courts, along with any reasons e chooses to provide.  

      The effect of granting a Motion depends on the nature of the
      Motion granted, but generally amounts to requiring the Judge to
      perform as requested by the Motion. 

      Upon receipt of a Judge's determination on a Motion, the Clerk
      the determination made and the reasons, if any, on the record of
      the CFJ, and shall notify the Player who made the Motion of that
      determination.  

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      Any Plauer may formally request a Judge issue any Judicial Order
      by filing a motion requesting that Order.  If granted, the Judge
      shall issue the Order requested.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1725 be repealed.  [If a Player
feels that a Judge has omitted an Order, e may file a Motion
requesting that that Order be issued, and may appeal the refusal of
that Motion, if refused.]

Chapter 2: Orders to Annotate ----------------------------------------

Be it further resolved, that Rule 789 be amended to read:

      The Judge of any CFJ, the Statement of which alleges that a Rule
      should be interpreted in a certain way, which is judged TRUE,
      may, at eir discretion, issue an Order requiring the Rulekeepor
      to annotate the Rule in question with the Statement of that CFJ.
      Such an annotation, while it exists, shall guide application of
      that Rule.  

      The Rulekeepor may remove such an annotation only if that Rule
      is repealed, or when required to do so by a valid Order.
      Annotations to a Rule may not be modified in any way except as
      specified in this Rule.

      If a Player believes that an annotation is no longer pertinent,
      e may file, in the original CFJ from which the Order of
      Annotation arises, a Motion to Vacate the Order of Annotation.
      If such a Motion is granted, the Judge granting it shall Order
      the original Order Vacated and shall Order the Rulekeepor to
      remove the annotation in question.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1500 be amended to read:

      The Judge of any CFJ, the Statement of which alleges that an SLC
      should be interpreted in a certain way, which is judged TRUE,
      may, at eir discretion, issue an Order requiring the Maintainer
      of that SLC to annotate the SLC in question with the Statement
      of that CFJ.  Such an annotation, while it exists, shall guide
      application of that SLC.  

      The Maintainer of that SLC may remove such an annotation only
      when the SLC ceases to exist, or when required to do so by a
      valid Order.  Annotations to an SLC may not be modified in any
      way except as specified in this Rule.

      If a Player believes that an annotation is no longer pertinent,
      e may file, in the original CFJ from which the Order of
      Annotation arises, a Motion to Vacate the Order of Annotation.
      If such a Motion is granted, the Judge granting it shall Order
      the original Order Vacated and shall Order the Maintainer of
      that SLC to remove the annotation in question.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1681 be amended, by replacing
"Injunction" with "Order".

Chapter 3: Orders to Compel ------------------------------------------

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1509 be amended to read:

      Upon a judicial finding that a Player has failed to perform a
      duty required of em by the Rules, the Judge so finding shall
      execute an Order, requiring that Player to perform that duty as
      soon as possible.  Such an Order is known as an Order to
      Compel.

      If the duty in question arises because the Player in question
      holds a specific Office or other position of official
      responsibility, the Order shall be directed to that Office or
      position.  If the Player holding that Office fails to perform
      the duty in question as ordered, the Judge shall Order that that
      Player be removed from Office or position.

      If the duty in question arises for a reason not related to the
      Player in question holding a specific Office or official
      position, and that Player fails to perform the duty as ordered,
      the Judge shall amend the Order to require the Speaker to
      perform that duty instead.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      The refusal of the Speaker to perform a duty when ordered to do
      so by an validly issued Order to Compel constitutes being an
      Impossible Speaker, as defined elsewhere.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      No valid Order to Compel may be directed to a Judge, or may
      require the performance of any duty required of Player by the
      virtue of that Player being a Judge.  Any such Order is invalid.
      Any CFJ alleging that a Judge has failed to perform a duty of a
      judicial nature shall be dismissed.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted: 

      A CFJ alleging that the Clerk of the Courts has failed to
      perform a duty of eir Office may, at the Caller's option, be
      filed with the Justiciar, who shall then perform all the duties
      of the Clerk of the Courts with respect to that CFJ.

Chapter 4: Formal Apologies ------------------------------------------

Be it further resolved, that Rule 908 be amended to read:

      Upon a judicial finding that a Player (herein called the Ninny)
      has acted or has failed to act in such a way as to be in
      violation of one or more Rules, the Judge so finding shall Order
      that Player to submit, within 72 hours, a Formal Apology.
      However, when the action (or failure to act) is subject to
      penalties by virtue of being defined to be a Crime or an
      Infraction, the Order is optional and may be issued at the
      Judge's discretion.

      A Formal Apology shall consist of a letter of at least 200
      words, to be published by the Ninny in the Public Forum,
      explaining the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
      for self-improvement.

      The Judge issuing such an Order may, at eir discretion, include
      in eir Order a list of up to ten Prescribed Words (to be chosen
      by the Judge) which must be included in the Formal Apology.  If
      the Judge elects to include Prescribed Words, all of the Words
      required must appear within the Formal Apology. 

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      The failure to abide by an Order to Submit a Formal Apology is
      an Infraction carrying a penalty of 3 Blots, to be reported by
      the Judge who issued the original Order.

Chapter 5: Appeals ---------------------------------------------------

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1564 be amended to read:

      The Judgement entered in any CFJ by its Judge, the grant or
      denial of any Motion, and the execution of any Judicial Order
      are all subject to review on appeal to a Board of Appeal.  In
      addition, a Board of Appeal shall review any claim that a Judge
      has failed to perform any duty of a Judicial nature which e was
      required to perform.
      
      In all cases, the insistence of any three Players, posted in the
      Public Forum, is sufficient to initiate the appeal of a
      particular matter.  In the case of the appeal of a Judicial
      Order, the insistence of any Player bound by the Order is
      sufficient.  In the case of a Judgement which convicts a Player
      of a Crime, the insistence of the convicted Player is
      sufficient.

      In each cases before a Board of Appeal, it shall collectively
      decide whether to affirm or to reverse the matter under appeal,
      and shall execute whatever Appellate Orders are necessary to
      enforce its determination.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1695 be amended to read:

      In the appeal of a Judicial Order, the Board shall consider
      whether the Order in question was both legally made and
      appropriate for the situation.

      If the Board finds that the Order was made legally, and was
      appropriate for the situation, it shall affirm the Order.  If an
      Order staying the execution of the appealed Order was entered,
      it shall vacate this stay.

      If the Board finds that the Order was made illegally, or that it
      was inappropriate for the situation, it shall vacate the
      original Order.  Should the Board further find that the Order
      was made without reasonable justification or for a clearly
      improper purpose, it shall (at its discretion) impose a penalty
      of 2 Blots upon the Judge who made the original Order.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      The Lead Justice of a Board of Appeals is the Justiciar, if e is
      serving on that Board, or the Player who serves in the place of
      the Justiciar otherwise.

Chapter 6: Technical Corrections -------------------------------------

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1742 be amended by replacing the
word "Injunctions" with "Orders".

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal 3713 (Blob)  AI = 1
Risky Rebellion 

Amend Rule 1664 to read:

      Any Player is either Abiding or Rebellious. A new Player is always
      Abiding when e becomes a player. A Player whose Location is the 
      Beer Hall can switch from Abiding to Rebellious or from Rebellious
      to Abiding by sending a message to the Public Forum saying e does
      change so. The Registrar shall maintain a list of all Players that
      are Rebellious. This list is known as the Red Pages, and is part
      of the Registrar's Report.

      A Player may Call for a Revolt at any time, by sending to the 
      Public Forum saying e does so. A Call for Revolt is only effective
      if the following conditions are met:

         i) The player posting the Call is Rebellious,
        ii) No other effective Call for Revolt has been made that week,
       iii) A successful Revolt has not occured for a month or more.

      As soon as possible after an effective Call for Revolt has been
      posted, the Registrar must determine whether the Revolt succeeds,
      as outlined below, and post the result to the Public Forum.

      The result of a Revolt is determined as follows: The Registrar
      selects a random integer from 1 to the number of Players at the
      time of the Call for Revolt. If this number is less than or equal
      to the number of Rebellious Players at the time of the Call for 
      Revolt, then the Revolt succeeds, otherwise it fails.

      If a Revolt succeeds, then the following events occur (in order):

         - The Registrar shall vacate all Blots of each Rebellious 
           Player.
         - The Registrar shall pay out 2 VTs to each Rebellious Player.

         - A Speaker Transition occurs
         - All Players that hold one or more Offices in the normal
           fashion cease to hold those in a normal fashion and hold them
           temporarily instead.
         - All Rebellious Players become Abiding again

      If a Revolt does not succeed, then:

         - All Rebellious Players gain 2 Blots.
         - The Player who Called for Revolt gains 2 (additional) Blots

      The Registrar shall execute all Payment Orders required by this 
      rule.
      
      The Registrar is authorised to vacate any payment orders this
      rule requires em to vacate.

Create a Rule with the title "Robespierre":

      There shall exist a Patent Title of "Robespierre".
      When a Revolt succeeds, the Player who Called for the Revolt is
      awarded this Title, and any previous holder of the Title loses it.

Proposal 3700 (Swann)  AI = 1
Ratification w/o Objection

Let the following Rule Be created;
{Title: Ratification Without Objection)

     Any Officer who holds an Office in Normal Fashion can Ratify an 
     Official Report Without Objection, provided the following 
     conditions hold;

       i) The Report to be Ratified is one that is legally permissible 
          to Ratify.
      ii) The Report to be Ratified was produced by the Player holding 
          the Office.
     iii) The Report to be Ratified is one that is required to be 
          produced and maintained by the Officer.

     A Speaker who is not Tainted is permitted to Ratify any Official 
     Report Without Objection provided that the Report is one legally 
     permissible to Ratify.

     A COE on any Report undergoing this process shall be deemed by the
     Rules to constitute an Objection.

{Comment: Ratification, back when it was a VOC, wasn't intended to
          merely be disaster relief.  This Rule should help Officers use 
          Ratification without all the hurdles of the Proposal system.}

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal 3701 (Swann)  AI = 1

Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Proposal Applications}

     There is a type of Application known as an Proposal Application.  
     Such an Application is executed by submitting it to the Promotor.  
     This application takes effect when executed.  For a Proposal 
     Application to take effect it must;

       i) Indicate it is a Proposal Application
      ii) Include the text of a single Proposal, clearly indicated as 
          such.
     iii) Specify the non-player entity which the Rules shall deem to 
          have submitted the included Proposal.  This entity cannot be 
          an entity defined elsewhere in the Rules as a Proposing 
          Entity.
      iv) Include the signature of the Executor of the non-player entity 
          specified in iii) above. (A Proposal Application may never be 
          executed on behalf of an entity with no Executor.)
       v) Include the signature of at least one other Player.

     If all the above conditions are met, the Application will be 
     executed upon its receipt by the Promotor.  The effect of the 
     Application is to temporarily designate the non-Player entity 
     specified in the Application as a Proposing Entity, and to submit 
     the included Proposal on behalf of that entity.  For the purpose of 
     the Rules governing Proposals, the included Proposal shall be 
     deemed to have been submitted when the Application was executed.  
     Immediately after this submission, the entity will cease being a 
     Proposing Entity.  (Losing this designation will not change the 
     identity of the Proposer, it will remain the non-Player entity 
     specified in the Application.)

{Comment: This allows Groups, Contests, and any entity with an Executor
          to make a proposal.  I*ve always been interested in allowing
          the possibility of Groups to propose legislation.  This also
          allows an easier method for group authorship of Rules rather
          than direct fiddling with the Attributions.  All you need is
          to create a contest called *Me & Him Inc.* and submit your
          Proposal Application.}

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal 3714 (Crito) AI = 1
Limited Indulgence Distribution

Amend Rule 1712 by replacing the text:

      At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Herald shall randomly
      distribute a number of Indulgences equal to the number of Blots
      executed in the past Week, less the number of Blots vacated in
      the past Week, among all Players: for each such Indulgence, the
      Herald shall randomly select one Player and issue a Payment
      Order from the Bank to that Player for one Indulgence.  If this
      number is negative, no distribution occurs.

with the text:

      At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Herald shall randomly
      distribute a number of Indulgences equal to one less than the
      difference of the total number of Blots held by all Players minus
      the total number of Indulgences held by all Players:  for each such
      Indulgence, the Herald shall randomly select one Player and issue a
      Payment Order from the Bank to that Player for one Indulgence.  If this
      number is not greater than zero, no distribution occurs.

[Comment:  Restores the "hot potato" Blot by restricting the distribution to
one less than the total number of Blots and is automatically self-adjusting
whenever someone de-registers while holding either Blots or Indulgences.  Also,
it corrects the problem that some people might have with requiring a
distribution of zero Indulgences.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal 3715 (Blob) AI = 1
Standing Down

Create a rule with title "Standing Down" and text:

     During the Voting Period of an Election, any Candidate for that
     Election may stand down, by posting a message to the Public
     Forum to that effect. The player is then no longer to be
     considered a Candidate for that Election. Any further votes
     cast in eir favour are invalid, and e cannot win the Election.

     When a player stands down, e has the option of transferring all
     votes so far cast for em to another Candidate in the Election,
     if one exists. To do so, e must explicitly state which Candidate
     e is transferring eir votes to, in the same message as the
     announcement that e is standing down. Any votes transferred in
     this fashion will be considered to be cast for the receiving
     Candidate.

     This rule takes precedence over other rules for determining the
     Winner of an Election.
