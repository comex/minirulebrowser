Vlad is correct.  P3837 was proposed by Andre, not Vlad.  My apologies
to both.

Proposal 3846 (Blob) AI = 1
Auctions

Create a rule, with title "Default Procedure for Auctions", and text:

      When an Auction is required and the procedure is not defined 
      elsewhere, the following standard Auction procedure shall be
      used. Details specified herein are defaults which may be 
      modified by other Rules for specific situations.

      (a) Auctioneer: The Auctioneer is the Entity responsible for 
          collecting bids and announcing the result of the Auction.
          This Entity is the Speaker if not otherwise specified.

      (b) Bidders: Every Player not on Hold may Bid in an Auction. 
          On Hold status is measured at the time a Player sends eir 
          Bid.

      (c) Auction Currency: Each Auction is conducted in one 
          particular currency. Unless otherwise specified, the Auction 
          Currency is the Voting Token.

      (d) Start of Auction: The Auction begins at the time the first 
          correct and legal announcement that an Auction is begun, as
          defined in other Rules, is sent to the Public Forum, 
          together with the identity of the Auctioneer, the Auction 
          Currency, and the value of the Starting Bid.

      (e) Starting Bid: The Starting Bid is the minimum possible
          value of a bid. If not otherwise specified, the Stating Bid
          is equal to the MUQ of the Auction Currency.

      (f) Making Bids: Each Bidder may make as many Bids as e desires
          during the Auction. A Bid is a message, sent to the Public
          Forum, announcing that the sender is bidding in that 
          particular Auction, and the amount of eir Bid. A Bid is 
          only valid if it satisfies the following conditions:

        (1) The Bid is not made before the start of the Auction, 
            or after its end.
        (2) The amount Bid is a multiple of the MUQ of the 
            Auction Currency.
        (3) The amount Bid is no less than the Starting Bid.
        (4) The Bid is larger than any other valid Bid made so 
            far in the Auction.

      (g) End of Auction: If, one week after the Auction started,
          there have been no Bids made. The Auction ends, and has no
          winner. Otherwise the Auction ends when 24 hours has passed
          without a valid Bid having been made.

      (h) The Winner: When the Auction ends, the Bidder who made the
          largest valid Bid in the Auction is the Winner. The 
          Auctioneer shall announce the Winner of the Auction as soon
          as possible after the end of the Auction, and shall issue
          a Payment Order from the Winner to the Bank, for an amount
          equal to the size of the winning Bid.

Create a rule, with title "Private Auctions", and text:

      If an Auction is designated by the rules as being Private,
      then Bids may only made by sending them privately to the
      Auctioneer. This rule takes precedence over the standard
      Auction procedure.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 3847 (General Chaos) AI = 2
Plainness is a Virtue

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1023 be amended to read:

      (a) Any Player who fails to perform, in a timely manner, an
          action required of em by the Rules is guilty of Tardiness, a
          Class D Crime.

      (b) The definition of "a timely manner" shall be at the sound
          discretion of the Judge assigned to judge a CFJ alleging
          this crime, but shall in no case include:
        (1) intentional failures to perform; nor
        (2) intentional and excessive delays in performance.

      (c) Generally, performance within one week's time will be timely
          unless the Rules suggest otherwise.  The performance of
          actions in an order other than that in which the duties to
          perform them were incurred may be used as evidence of
          untimely performance, but is not proof thereof.

      (d) This Rule in no way modifies any requirement imposed by
          other Rules to perform specific acts within a specific time
          or in a specific order.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 3848 (Chuck) AI = 1
Power to the Rulekeepor


Rule 947 is amended to read:

      If a Proposal is adopted which, as part of all of its effect,
      repeals one or more Rules, and immediately prior to the
      adoption of this Proposal there were more than 100 Rules, the
      Rulekeepor shall pay out 1 P-Note to the Proposer of that
      Proposal, if, in the Rulekeepor's estimation, the Proposal
      simplifies the Ruleset.  If the Rulekeepor decides that the
      Proposal does not simplify the Ruleset, e must announce this
      decision.

      When the Rulekeepor decides that such a Proposal does not
      simplify the Ruleset, the Executor of the Proposal's Proposer
      may reverse the Rulekeepor's decision Without Three Objections,
      provided the procedure for doing so is initiated within one
      week of the announcement of the Rulekeepor's decision.  When
      the Rulekeepor's decision is reversed in this manner, the
      Executor of the Proposal's Proposer shall pay out 1 P-Note
      to the Proposal's Proposer.
