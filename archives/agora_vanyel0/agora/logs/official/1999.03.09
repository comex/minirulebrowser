Dan: Well, Billy Bob, any surprises this round?
Billy Bob: I think the biggest puzzler is the number of players who
have yet to score. C'mon people! All it took to get a point was to
vote once during the past two weeks. I thought we had a duty to vote
or sumpin'
Dan: Well, apart from Oerjan "Inertia" Johansen, Peekee, and Morendil
"The Non-Rolling Stone", points came pretty easy this week with
no less than six unanimous proposals.
Billy Bob: It looks like some Players are handing them out on a
platter. Get 'em whole they're hot!
Dan: Well said. And, as you predicted, the Third Circle is quite
competitive.
Billy Bob: More fun than wrasslin' a greased pig in a rattlesnake
pen. We can only hope things stay interesting.
Dan: Well, I'm, sure they will, BB, I'm sure they will.

Ask Miss Mannewix
(To submit questions to Miss Mannewix, send them to c647100@showme.
missouri.edu with the words "Ask Miss Mannewix" in the Subject
heading)

Dear Miss Mannewix,

   I have a problem. Every time I post protoproposals to the list,
nobody comments. Then when I go and propose them, they fail! Does
everybody hate me or am I doing something wrong?

                                         Signed,
                                         Frustrated

Dear Frustrated,

   It's not you, it's them. They are too lazy to get up off their
butts and make a few suggestions. Or maybe it is you. You might be
so uncreative that you lull the other Players to sleep with your
droning nonsense. Either way, I sense a large therapy bill for
this dysfunctional family.

                                         Signed,
                                         Miss Mannewix


Dear Miss Mannewix,

   I have this really cool idea for a Rule. You see, we give all
the Players ranks, then hand out Promotion Points based on their
activities. Promotion points are traded in for currencies to spend,
or they can be traded in for more Promotion points. Then we establish
Guilds of Players, and have them compete to devise Rules, which are
then traded among them with the best Rules winning, as adjudged by
the Adjudicator. Disputes are resolved in favor of the Player with the
highest rank, or by the spending of promotion points by the Players'
respective Guilds. Then every two weeks we randomly shift a Player
from one guild to the next, and also choose a Rule to give to the
Guild that lost the Player, which can then trade it in for more
Promotion Points. What do you think?

                                        Signed,
                                        Excited

Dear Excited,

   I think you need less caffeine. Perhaps you can get get together
with Frustrated at a Tibetan retreat somewhere. It'd do both of
you a world of good.

                                        Signed,
                                        Miss Mannewix


Dear Miss Mannewix,

  I have a problem with my neighbor. It seems she lets hier dog out at
night, and its barking keeps me from concentrating on Nomic. I was
only able to post 34 Proposals last week. I tried to sue her, but
the courts threw out my case. What can I do?

                                         Signed,
                                         Legal Eagle


Dear Legal Eagle,

  So you're the guy next door who sits in front of his computer all
day.

                                         Signed,
                                         Miss Mannewix



This Week's Special Feature:
Christmas Shopping for your favorite Agoran
by Horace Undernut, TSR's business consultant

As we all know, it's never too early to begin Christmas shopping. And
this year promises to be the best ever for friends and family of
Agoran players. I am joined by Dr. Gorog Sprzmysl, consumer expert.

TSR: So, Doctor, what have our readers to look forward to this
shopping season?

GS: There are a lot of good ideas out there as companies jump onto the
business bandwagon that is Nomic. A smart consumer can snap up some
great bargains.

TSR: I see you have selected some items to show us. What is this here?

GS: The Franklin Mint (TM) has issued a commemorative coin for Agora's
fifth anniversary. Minted from .999 proof silver, the obverse bears
a portrait of Peter Suber while the reverse has Agora's symbol and its
motto "USQUAM PER LEGES". At only US$9.99, it's in the reach of even
the most poverty-stricken Player.

TSR: Magnificent detail in Suber's hair. And what do we have here?

GS: Perfect for the disgruntled ex-Player, the Agora toilet-seat cover
makes a statement every time you go to the john. It runs for US$24.95.

TSR: I see you've saved the best for last. This is truly something.

GS: Ah, yes, the Agora commemorative chess set. With marble and jet
figures with gold highlights, on a teak and mahogany board, this is a
gift for the Agora conoisseur. As you can see, each piece is modeled
after a Player of Agora. On the white side, Steve Gardner is the king,
General Chaos is the queen, elJefe and Chuck Carroll are the
rooks, Michael Norrish and Oerjan are the bishops, Blob and Morendil
are the knights, and the pawns are miniature mousetraps. 

TSR: Fascinating. And the black side?

GS: There you have Ronald Kunne as the king, David Wagner as the
Queen, Wes Contreras and KoJen as the rooks, Vlad and David Nicol as
the bishops, Swann and Andre as the knights, and the pawns are
miniature walruses.

TSR: And the cost?

GS: It can all be yours for only US$499.99.

TSR: I'll get one for my office. Thanks for your time, good Doctor.
