Herald/Accountor take note: 

I hereby report that Murphy and Harlequin have both committed one
instance of the Infraction of Judging Late.  As neither have returned
a Judgement, they are therefore liable to a penalty of 3 Blots. 

Therefore:
        I order Harlequin to pay the Bank 3 Indulgences.
        I order Murphy to pay the Bank 3 Indulgences. 

Moreover, my interpretation of R1567 is that Murphy is still liable
for a fee of 0.5 VTs because he made himself ineligible.  (There is a
very poor interaction between this rule and R408.) 

Therefore:
        I order Murphy to pay the Bank 0.5 VTs. 

Both Murphy and Harlequin are no longer eligible to judge their
respective CFJs. 

CotC Michael.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

For the basic valitity of a private transfer order I refer the Judge
to the Reasons and Arguments of the first Coup d'etat CFJ. (qv)

For the validity of the current statement, there are only two rules
that would impose additional restrictions on these Orders.  These are
Rules 1796 and 1830.

The apparently strong Rule 1830;

>       No valid Order to Compel may be directed to a Judge, or may
>       require the performance of any duty required of Player by the
>       virtue of that Player being a Judge.  Any such Order is
>       invalid.  Any CFJ alleging that a Judge has failed to perform
>       a duty of a judicial nature shall be dismissed.

There are a number of flaws here.  One, it is arguable that one can
compel Judical actions as long as the Player comelled is not a Judge
at the time, which none of the Players in the Orders in question were.
Two, the rule makes no refernce to Orders that phrohibit action
(ie. An order not to Judge FALSE) which is the form in which the
Orders in question were cast.  Three, the most devistating flaw, this
rule refers *only* to Orders to Compel-- a specific type of Order
defined in Rule 1509;

>       Upon a judicial finding that a Player has failed to perform a
>       duty required of em by the Rules, the Judge so finding shall
>       execute an Order, requiring that Player to perform that duty
>       as soon as possible.  Such an Order is known as an Order to
>       Compel.
>

It is unquestionably true that the Orders in question were *not*
Orders to Compel as defined in the rules, and therefore 1830 does not
apply at all.

The other rule that applies is Rule 1796;

>       Furthermore, no Order may act to prevent or hinder its own
>       appeal in any way, and any portion of an Order which has this
>       effect is void and without force.

This is much simpler.  None of the Orders in question hinder their
*own* appeal, they only hinder the appeal of other Orders, which is
not forbidden.

Given these facts, I believe that the Judge has no question but to
rule these Orders valid.
======================================================================
Evidence:


Rule 1796/0 (Power=1)
Validity of Orders

      All Orders executed in the manner prescribed by the Rules for
      their class and type are presumed valid and enforceable until
      proven otherwise by CFJ.

      In order to be proven valid by CFJ, the Rules must permit the
      Player who executed the Order in question to execute such an
      Order, that the execution of the Order must have been required
      by or permitted in the circumstances which existed at the time
      it was executed, and that the Order has not been rendered
      invalid by the operation of any other Rule.

      Furthermore, no Order may act to prevent or hinder its own
      appeal in any way, and any portion of an Order which has this
      effect is void and without force.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1509/3 (Power=1)
Orders to Compel

      Upon a judicial finding that a Player has failed to perform a
      duty required of em by the Rules, the Judge so finding shall
      execute an Order, requiring that Player to perform that duty as
      soon as possible.  Such an Order is known as an Order to
      Compel.

      If the duty in question arises because the Player in question
      holds a specific Office or other position of official
      responsibility, the Order shall be directed to that Office or
      position.  If the Player holding that Office fails to perform
      the duty in question as ordered, the Judge shall Order that that
      Player be removed from Office or position.

      If the duty in question arises for a reason not related to the
      Player in question holding a specific Office or official
      position, and that Player fails to perform the duty as ordered,
      the Judge shall amend the Order to require the Speaker to
      perform that duty instead.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1830/0 (Power=1)
No Compulsion of Judges

      No valid Order to Compel may be directed to a Judge, or may
      require the performance of any duty required of Player by the
      virtue of that Player being a Judge.  Any such Order is invalid.
      Any CFJ alleging that a Judge has failed to perform a duty of a
      judicial nature shall be dismissed.

                               CFJ 1096

  An Order, as defined in Rule 1793, and of whatever type, is "a Nomic
  Entity created in accordance with the Rules" in the sense of Rule
  1513 and as such is subject to the limitations set forth in that
  Rule, and in particular that Orders derive coercive power from some
  Rules and that the Rules take precedence over Orders whenever an
  Order conflicts with a Rule.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

I can easily predict that we'll have a hard time dealing with
Swann's recent posts unless we hare a clear notion of how to deal
with Orders as a whole. I propose the above principle, with Orders
being NREs deriving coercive power from, specifically, Rules 1810 and
1811 (although that may be debated, which is why I didn't make the
CFJ dependent on that).

The rationale for that principle is that insofar as the Rules can be
said to "compel" or "prohibit" certain actions which are non-
retractable Moves, the instrument of such coercion is the threat of
being cited for a Crime or Infraction. Thus a Rule which makes a
Crime or Infraction of some action or inaction which is defined in
some body of text other than the Rules themselves can be said to
grant coercive power to that body of text, which brings it under the
purview of Rule 1513.

Thus, an Order prohibiting a Player from Calling for Judgement,
which is what the Orders in "Here we go..." effectively do, is in
conflict with Rule 911, and as such shall be deemed invalid; most
of Swann's other Orders are dealt with similarly, or at the least
innocuuous given that the higher-precedence judicial framework
is preserved by the NRE principle. Conversely, the NRE principle
does not rob other Orders of their effectiveness, and will not
require huge patching up of the Orders Rules to close supposed
loopholes therein.

Elections to begin for these posts, and I do this by calling for
nominations for these offices.  Nominations must be received by me
within a week.
