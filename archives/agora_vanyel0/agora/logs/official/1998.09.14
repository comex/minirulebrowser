Agora Nomic
Ambassador's Report

Date of this Report: 14 Sep 1998

======================================================================
Diplomatic Report

Nothing official to report.

For those who are interested I will publish in an extra document some
recent notes exchanged between myself and representatives of the
Pumpkin Patch. I think they show very clearly that there is no basis
for any hostility between us and this worthy nomic, and I consider
this "affair" as a highly enjoyable episode of life in Internomic, and
one that makes me enjoy the office of Ambassador.

======================================================================
Friendliness Report:

Friendly: Agora, FRC, InterNomic
Hostile:  none

 Re: Internomic Votes from PPN

Mr. Moderator:
Thank you for your explanation regarding why our votes were not
counted.  There remains the unpleasant matter of the apology however.
The Patch has a long and somewhat vindictive memory.  It has to be a
real apology and you have to mean it.  I have also decided to unveil the
Patch's secret foreign policy which you usually can be obtained by two
box tops of Trix cereal and a personal check in the amount of
1,000,000.00 Canadien Dollars payable to Her Majestic
Splendiferousness.  The foreign policy has three factors:
1.  Is it good for the Patch?
2.  Will Agora suffer because of it?
3.  Have they asked nicely?  (Use of the "magic" word is strongly
encouraged)

The bottom line is that if you want a yes vote from the patch see the
above factors and act accordingly.

With all due respect,
bt
acting liason to Internomic while the GRAPE is out of town pursuant to
the Rules of the Pumpkin Patch Nomic Game irregardless of whatever
Internomic Rules the Agorans will attempt to make us practice, we will
remain free and sovereign no matter what.

[To the Patch]

Dear fellow Internomicers of the Pumpkin Patch,

Recently your representative to IN, the GRAPE, explained your policy
concerning IN proposals. E mentioned three key factors in this policy:

>>
1.  Is it good for the Patch?
2.  Will Agora suffer because of it?
3.  Have they asked nicely?
<<

It is, of course, not in the interest of Agora to meddle with other IN
members' internal affairs. And we do appreciate that you published
these guidelines, because that helped to avoid the unpleasant, and
fortunately wrong, impression that the Patch is blocking IN proposals
whimsically and without considering their merits.

However, the requirement that "Agora suffer" has us confused and
surprized. We Agorans do not understand why the Patch should be
interested to hurt us.

Recently there have been accusations against Agora, saying that some
tiome ago some of our players joined another nomic with the intent of
changing its rules. While some participants in the ensuing debate
simply stated that an intention to change the rules is an essential
motivation for playing in any nomic game, I have also demonstrated
that all allegations that Agora players ever "invaded" another nomic
and/or caused any damage there, against the will of the established
players, are unfounded and have no facts to support them.

I would therefore be glad to hear from the Patch whether our
impression that an anti-Agoran attitude prevails in the Patch is due
to a misunderstanding, or to any questions which we may resolve in a
peaceful and civilized debate, or whether this attitude is a result of
the playfully non-serious general athmosphere that seems to reign in
the Patch in general, or of any other random influence beyond your
explicit control.

I must stress that I am asking for such an explanation, not in a
threatening or aggressive way (why, and how, should I?), but out of a
genuine curiosity to understand the issue, and to figure out whether,
and how, Agora should respond to the situation.

Looking forward to your reply,

Kolja A., Agora ambassador to IN and other nomics.


Technical P.S. :

It would be nice to see your reply on the agora discussion mailing
list, to which I cc'ed this mail. However, because we've had spam
problems on the list, only people subscribed to the list can post
messages to it. 

So if you want to reply to the general Agora public, you can either
reply to me and mention that I may distribute your posts to Agora, or
you can subscribe to the mailing list

agora-discussion@gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au 

by sending a mail to 

Majordomo@gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au 

with the message body "subscribe agora-discussion". Note that this
list is only used to conduct informal discussions, and joining this
list or sending any posts to it has no consequences whatsoever for the
game, gamestate etc. of Agora nomic.

This is incorrect. Our GRAPE, er Phil, is in Maui sharpening his pencil.
These words appeared in a message from the player known variously as bt,
bowser, TAFKAB, and the hoosier hound, who in no way coincidentally is

GET THE JOKE. There is a prevailing attitude in the Patch that Agorans are
slow to appreciate humor, an attitude which, unfortunately, your post to
the patchkins has only contributed additional evidence.

First, whimsy has a high value in the Patch and I would suggest you reflect
on your unconscious linking of "whimsically" and "without considering...".
Then I would suggest that you consider that the proposals might be without
merit or that there might be some game advantage to the Patch in voting no.
I hesitate to suggest the latter because I in no way wish to imply that I
am pointing out the obvious.

I have been wondering if there are random influences which are NOT beyond
my explicit control. Some say that boswer fits the criteria. Some say not.
Does an anti-Agoran attitude prevail in the Patch? No, if by that you mean
that do we hate you. We enjoy sharing our jokes with you and we have laid
bets many a time as to whether you would know it was indeed a joke. Some of
us have played in other nomics and we have all noticed that individual have
certain reputations, eg. Agora is the serious nomic.

I appreciate your efforts in setting things straight. One would not want
them to be akilter. No, indeed not. I counsel you to take a deep breath,
repeat "there's no place like home" three times, and comfort your fellow
Agorans back in Kansas. Agora is Agora and the Pumpkin Patch is the Pumpkin
Patch. I will add this, some of us have played in Agora or rather we joined
Agora. There have been discussions in the Patch over the years as to the
meaning of "game" and "play" and strangely enough we have been able to live
with the paradox that these concepts need not be incompatible with "fun"
and "whimsy."

Forgive me if I lay it on too thick, but I want to be sure that you
completely understand.

Her Splendiferousness, the Now and Only Pumpkin

Dear Now and Only Pumpkin,

Thank you very much for your detailed and friendly reply to my
questions.

You may remember that the whole liaison debate was triggered by my
absence from Agora (and eMail-access in general) for some
time. Therefore, unfortunately, I could not follow the discussion in
detail. I guess this explains my misinterpretation of your intentions
in the mail I was referring to.

>>

While my above remark may partly absolve me from the charge of
unnecessary seriousness, in general you have a point, of course. I'm
looking forward to the Agorans' reactions to this, and commend you for
this successful attempt to demonstrate our style to the IN community.

On the other hand I think you, in turn, noticed that I deliberately
wrote in an open style, expecting anything from the kind of reply I
actually got, to a fun (or even 'serious', whatever that may mean
speaking of the Patch) attempt to spice up IN by playing out an
inter-nomic conflict (all of which I would have acknowledged happily
as worthy - and enjoyable - contributions to the game).

There is no such link, which is exactly why I made sure to mention
these two items separately. Rereading my own sentence, though, i admit
that I should have connected these items with "or" instead of "and".

That's good to hear. And I'd like to add that for me it is a
considerable success of the IN project that it manages to bring
together nomics with different playing styles on an official level (in
addition to the player level, where individuals always have been
participating in various games with varying styles, and enjoying all
of them). 

There should be some kind of IN reward for successful diplomacy,
e.g. for cases where you played a joke on us, knew it was one, and
knew that we wouldn't recognize it as such, _and_ it all worked out.

Thanks, so do I concerning your efforts.

I certainly will. But don't worry about us too much - sometimes we
do understand such issues, and still deliberately choose to play in
our 'serious' style because (believe it or not) we are enjoying it
(see my B.N. Thesis on "Metagaming or Roleplaying - two Approaches to
Playing Nomic", available from
<http://www.tp3.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/~klaush/nomic/thesis.txt>)

>>
Forgive me if I lay it on too thick, but I want to be sure that you

No problem. I appreciate your clarity. In fact, my request for
information was deliberately held vague enough to allow meta- or
roleplaying level answers, that I would have appreciated getting an
answer on any of these levels, and that I'm glad to see that on the
meta level the Now and Only Pumpkin and my humble self appear to have
very similar ideas and ideals about nomic, although the roleplaying
aspect and the general athmosphere is very different in the games we
play.
