Dan: Well, BB, what have we learned over the past week or two?
Billy Bob: that whoever came up with the initial seeding was an
idiot! The Second and Third Circles both lead the First, and
besides one of the First Circle Players just deregistered, while
another is a mere Zombie!
Dan, Well, at least that should get ironed out next round. I'm 
struck by the lack of scoring recently. We had 107.5 points scored 
during the first nine days of this Round, and only 43 by my count
since then.
Billy Bob: That's 'cause the cheap points are running out faster'n
my grandmother's moonshine! If you get a Proposal passed, unanimously
(pretty easy nowadays), you get 10 for the prop, 4 for the Patent
Title. But you can only score the PT points once, and the proposal
bonuses decrease with each additional one. So Chuck is the only one
to get the full package this week.
Dan: Well, what does this mean for the upcoming weeks?
Billy Bob: That Players will have to get creative if they want to
win. There are still plenty of points to be had. All it takes
is someone to get creative. Take the following proposal as an
example:

----------
This is a Proposal titled "Vlad in the Rules"

Create a Rule with the following text:

Vlad is a very clever Player
This Rule shall repeal itself one week after it is adopted.
----------

Billy Bob: Now that right there is worth 15 Points to ol' Vlad, not
counting what he gets if it passes!
Dan, Well, I think Players will have to be a bit more clever than
that.
Billy Bob: Sure, sure. But don't be surprised if someone comes up with
a plan in the near future.

4) Nomic Travel Tips with Harvey Niederbieber
Interview by Travis "Bathrobe" McFarley of TSR

TMcF: Hello, readers. Today we have with us Harvey Niederbieber,
travel expert. Harvey is going to tell us the dos and donts
of Nomic-related travel. Harvey: what are the hot destinations
this year?
HN: Well, Vladivostok is selling nicely with the decline in the
ruble, although the terrain is a bit rugged for some. Unfortunately,
the other popular destinations are even more obscure: Indiana, the
home of Douglas Hofstadter, who popularized Nomic, and Australia,
the home of the first Nomic MUD.
TMcF: So I gather travellers should expect to leave behind most of
the pleasures of civilization?
HN: Well, it's rumored that Australia has passable beer, but if you're
talking about things like electricity or hot water, then yes.
TMcF: Wait a minute. If there is no electricity in Australia, how
were they able to support an Internet-based MUD?
HN: In this case they put together a portable generator powered by
sheep droppings, but the remains soon clogged the mechanism.
TMcF: I see. Are there any special events travellers should be
looking for?
HN: Well, the Institute for Advanced Nomic Research based out in
California will be hosting a symposium in July, but I'll warn
your readers that these things generally prove to be a snoozefest.
Here are some of the titles: "An Analysis of the Mousetrap Scam",
"The Need for Multiple levels of Mutability in Nomic Rulesets",
"Agoran History: The First Twelve Months". Booooring.
TMcF: Will you be doing any travelling this year?
HN: I'll be heading to Geneva this September for the Multiple Nomic
Cabal's World Domination Conference but.... oh shit. I wasn't supposed
to mention that. Gotta run.
TMcF: It seems our interview has been cut short. I thank Mr.
Niederbieber for his time.

Text of Adopted Proposals

Proposal 3848 (Chuck) AI = 1
Power to the Rulekeepor
      
      
Rule 947 is amended to read:
      
      If a Proposal is adopted which, as part of all of its effect,
      repeals one or more Rules, and immediately prior to the
      adoption of this Proposal there were more than 100 Rules, the   
      Rulekeepor shall pay out 1 P-Note to the Proposer of that
      Proposal, if, in the Rulekeepor's estimation, the Proposal
      simplifies the Ruleset.  If the Rulekeepor decides that the
      Proposal does not simplify the Ruleset, e must announce this
      decision.

      When the Rulekeepor decides that such a Proposal does not  
      simplify the Ruleset, the Executor of the Proposal's Proposer   
      may reverse the Rulekeepor's decision Without Three Objections,
      provided the procedure for doing so is initiated within one
      week of the announcement of the Rulekeepor's decision.  When 
      the Rulekeepor's decision is reversed in this manner, the   
      Executor of the Proposal's Proposer shall pay out 1 P-Note
      to the Proposal's Proposer.
