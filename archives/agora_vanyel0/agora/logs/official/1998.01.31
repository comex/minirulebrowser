                               CFJ 1083

     "If a Player makes two Votes FOR a Proposal, and subsequently
      cancels those votes, and no other Player in any way Votes on
      the Proposal, the Voting Index of that Proposal at the end of
      its Voting Period is two."

History:

  Assigned to General Chaos, as of this message


======================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

Rule 1442, in describing the method of cancelling votes, only states that
such a cancellation "cancels" the Votes. However, they were at one time
legally cast. Rule 955, in defining Voting Indices, only counts Votes that
were "legally cast;" it does not say "Votes which have been legally cast
and not cancelled at the end of the Voting Period." Therefore, any votes
which were legally cast, no matter what their later status, shall count
towards the Proposal's Voting Index.
