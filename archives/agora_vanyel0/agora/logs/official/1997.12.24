Repeal-O-Matic

Now that I have a good, current Ruleset, it's time to discharge my duties as
Promotor wrt to the Repeal-O-Matic.  This actually passed sometime during the
week of November 10, so I have 6 weeks of backlog to make up.  Here they are.

By my count, the current Ruleset has 289 Rules.  Random selection is done as
follows.  The Rules are numbered consecutively from 0 to 288 according to the
position they take within the SLR distributed by Chuck.  I turn on my MIT
scheme random number generator and spit out five random numbers between 0 and
288.  Each number corresponds to a Rule - simple.

==============
Week of Nov 17

Numbers generated   -  206,    7,  119,   16,  161
Corresponding Rules - 1738,  795,  408, 1079, 1668

Nothing particularly exciting.  Seems slightly ironic to repeal the definition
of "random", so I will choose R1079, Definition of "Random", as the lone
candidate for this week.

PROPOSAL: Repeal Rule 1079
                     This Proposal shall have an AI = 1
                     Rule 1079 is hereby Repealed.
==============
Week of Nov 24

Numbers generated   -  122,  142,  254,   66,   35
Corresponding Rules - 1575, 1695, 1630, 1623, 1042

Hmm, let's see what the electorate really thinks of Disinterest.

PROPOSAL: Repeal Rule 1623
                     This Proposal shall have an AI = 1
                     Rule 1623 is hereby Repealed.

==============
Week of Dec 1

Numbers generated   -  259,   92,  164,  117,  198
Corresponding Rules - 1458,  955, 1657, 1567, 1732

Well, I don't think we want to do away with useful Offices, and Power 3 is
tempting, but no point in repealing 955.  Repealing 1732 would be just plain
mean (and wouldn't pass anyway).  Which leaves...  (Making Oneself Ineligible
To Judge a CFJ)

PROPOSAL: Repeal Rule 1567
                     This Proposal shall have an AI = 1
                     Rule 1567 is hereby Repealed.

==============
Week of Dec 8

Numbers generated   -  203,   59,  254,  192,  191
Corresponding Rules - 1661, 1698, 1630, 1599, 1471

I'd rather get caught up before doing anything controversial.  Speaker
Patronage is safe enough.  8)

PROPOSAL: Repeal Rule 1661
                     This Proposal shall have an AI = 1
                     Rule 1661 is hereby Repealed.

==============
Week of Dec 15

Numbers generated   -  154,  260,  102,   25,  144
Corresponding Rules - 1494,  717, 1583,  869,  908

I happen to think the Welcome Wagon is a good idea, but it doesn't seem to be
used anyway.  So, what the heck.

PROPOSAL: Repeal Rule 1494
                     This Proposal shall have an AI = 1
                     Rule 1494 is hereby Repealed.

==============
Week of Dec 22

Numbers generated   -  125,   72,  206,  216,   84
Corresponding Rules -  502,  109, 1738, 1741, 1625

How fortuitous!  This way we don't have to worry about the controversy over the
Bank having negative balances.

PROPOSAL: Repeal Rule 1741
                     This Proposal shall have an AI = 1
                     Rule 1741 is hereby Repealed.

==============

Note that these proposals have just been submitted, but are not yet
distributed.  They will come out with my next regular proposal distribution.
