There are 332 rules in the latest short logical ruleset.

195 : Rule 1813 (Imposition of Penalties for Infractions)
 25 : Rule 1513 (Authority of Non-Rule Entities)

 public, giving players more opportunity to spend P-Notes to raise 
 or lower Priorities.]

Reduce P-Note Inflation

Amend Rule 1047 (Patent Title of Zeitgeist) by removing the
paragraph:

      When a Player is awarded the Patent Title of Zeitgeist, the
      Assessor shall pay out one P-Note to that Player.

Amend Rule 947 (Bonus for Repeal) to read:

      If a Proposal is adopted which, as part of all of its effect,
      repeals one or more Rules, and immediately prior to the
      adoption of this Proposal there were more than 100 Rules, the
      Rulekeepor shall pay out 1 P-Note to the Proposer of that
      Proposal.

[Comment: P-Note rewards in some rules are excessive, especially
 considering the current proposing/voting climate. This proposal
 aims to stem the current out-pouring of P-Notes. A third amendment
 reducing the payments from INPs, has been removed, as it is covered
 by Kolja's recent proposal.]
