FROM THE OFFICE OF THE PROMOTOR:

There are two proposals distributed as of this report, numbered from
3825 to 3826.  The Voting Periods of these Proposals commence as of
this message and end seven days later unless otherwise noted.  Voting
on these Proposals will cost 0 VTs.  

======================================================================

No.  Proposer           AI    Name
3825 Steve              1     A Duty to Vote
3826 The Repeal-O-Matic 1     Repeal Rule 1865 (A Duty to Propose)

======================================================================

Proposal 3825 (Steve) AI = 1
A Duty to Vote

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule entitled "A Duty to Vote" be created
with the following text:

      An Active Player with effective control of more than three Voting
      Tokens at the time a batch of Proposals is distributed, who is not
      denied Voting Privileges at that time, who is Active at the end of
      the Voting Period of the Proposal in the batch whose Voting Period
      finishes latest, and who fails to cast a vote on any Proposal in
      the batch, commits the Infraction of Failure to Vote, to be
      detected and reported by the Assessor. The penalty for commission
      of this Infraction is one Blot and one Voting Token.

      Effective control of an asset (e.g., a unit of Currency) is the
      ability to dispose of that asset as one wishes. The Assessor is
      empowered to make determinations as to whether a Player has
      effective control over a particular asset at a particular time.
      Such determinations may be overturned by the Courts.

      Three months after this Rule is created, it repeals itself.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 3826 (The Repeal-O-Matic) AI = 1
Repeal Rule 1865 (A Duty to Propose)

    1865  Rule  is hereby Repealed.
