=====================================================================

                               CFJ 1088

  "When a Proposal is declared to be a Senate Proposal, and Votes
   were previously cast on such a Proposal by Entities who were not
   Senators, such Votes are nevertheless still legal Votes and should be
   taken into account for the purpose of determining Voting results."


======================================================================

Judge:      Michael
Judgement:  TRUE

Eligible:   Antimatter, Blob, Chuck, Crito, elJefe,
            Harlequin, Jester, Kolja A., Michael, Murphy, Oerjan,
            Sherlock, Steve, Swann, Time Agent

Ineligible:
Caller:     Morendil
Barred:
On request:
On hold:    General Chaos


======================================================================
History:

  Called by Morendil, 10 Mar 1998 09:05:41 +0100
  Assigned to Michael, 19 Mar 1998 11:34:01 +0000
  Judged TRUE, 26 Mar 1998 08:28:57 +0000


======================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

Rule 683 defines what "legal Votes" are. It does not contain a
provision allowing other Rules to alter the legality of a Vote after
the fact. Rule 995 defines the Voting results on a Proposal as a
tally of all Votes that have been "legally cast".

Rule 1717 claims that a Vote cast by a non-Senator at the time a
Proposal is declared to be a Senate Proposal is 'cancelled', which
can only be interpreted as a claim to override the definition of a
legal Vote as specified by Rule 683. Thus, Rule 1717 is in conflict
with Rule 683 with respect to such Votes.

However, it does not explicitly claim precedence; therefore, Rule
683 wins that conflict, and Votes cast by non-Senators before a
declaration of a Senate Proposal are still legal.

Note however that Votes cast by non-Senators after such a
declaration are not valid, as it is the first sentence of Rule 206
that is relevant in that case.


======================================================================
Judge's Reasons and Arguments:

The Caller's arguments seem sound.  The situation which held at the
time of the calling of this CFJ was this:

* proposals pass/are adopted if they receive sufficient (legal) votes
  (R955, power = 3)

* a vote is legally cast if it is cast during the Voting Period of
  a Proposal and if the Voting Entity casting the vote is entitled to
  cast a vote on that particular Proposal (R683, power = 1).

* "Entities other than Senators cannot Vote on Senate Proposals.
   If an Entity other than a Senator has already voted on a
   Proposal by the time it becomes a Senate Proposal, eir votes
   on that Proposal are cancelled."  (R1717, power = 1)

Our initial question is to ask what it means for a vote to be
cancelled.  A natural interpretation of this provision is to assume it
means that a vote is deprived of its legal effect.  This view seems
consistent with R1442, which discusses what happens when a Voting
Entity to voluntarily cancel its votes.

However, neither R1717 nor R1442 claims precedence over R683.  Nor
does R683 yield precedence.  Therefore, it must be the case that if
R683 says a vote is legally cast, then it is cast and must be counted,
R1717 and R1442 notwithstanding.

There is still one more condition to investigate.  R683 requires that
a Voting Entity be entitled to cast a vote if that vote is to be
legal.  An argument against the statement of the CFJ might claim that
when a Proposal is made a Senate Proposal this action will
retroactively deprive Voting Entities of their entitlement to cast
legal votes.

I reject this argument on the grounds that this view is too much of a
stretch to impose on the language of R683.  Here is the relevant
sentence as it appears in the rule :

  "A Vote is legally cast if it is cast during the Voting Period of
   that Proposal, and if that Voting Entity is entitled to cast a Vote
   on that particular Proposal."

It is far too much to ask this rule to mean "... if that Voting Entity
is entitled to cast a Vote and remains entitled to having been able to
cast that Vote on that particular Proposal for the rest of its Voting
Period."  While such an interpretation has some appeal (it would deny
legality to votes cast by Players who deregister while a Proposal's
Voting Period is in progress, and would simplify the Senate rule), it
is *not* what is currently written, and is too far in sense from what
is written to be a possible interpretation of Rule 683.

Therefore I return a judgement of TRUE.

(1.) This Judgement was not delivered to the CotC within the assigned
time
and receives no salary (Rule 591).  Instead, Morendil has committed the
Infraction of Judging Late, and is ordered to pay 1 VT to the Bank (Rule
408).

(2.) H. Scorekeepor:  Judge Morendil gains 3 points for delivering
Judgement.

(3.) The Judgement is appealed by Judge Morendil.  However, under the
recently amended Rule 1564, the Judge's own call for appeal is no longer
sufficient to initiate an appeal, and 2 more calls for appeal are
needed.

As a result of the above Blots, each of the following Players lose 4
points:

    Morendil, Sherlock, Blob, Time Agent, Murphy.


I note that this points out a flaw in the scoring Rule.  Even though the
Blots
against Sherlock have been vacated, e has no recourse for recovering the
points
lost.  We should probably add the provision that 2 points are gained for
each
Blot vacated.

Text of Adopted Proposals
======================================================================
Proposal 3716 (Chuck)  AI = 1  (Sane)
CounterScam the Veto Scam, Part I

A Rule shall be created with the following text:

      Upon creation of this Rule, the Voting Index of the Proposal
      entitled "CounterScam the Veto Scam, Part II" shall be set to 6.
      Immediately following that, the Proposal entitled "CounterScam
      the Veto Scam, Part II" shall take effect; that is, the
      provisions contained in the text of that Proposal shall be
      implemented to the maximal extent permitted by the Rules.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would prevent
      "CounterScam the Veto Scam, Part II" from having effect at
      the time required by this Rule, or from having effect at all.

      All references to "CounterScam the Veto Scam, Part II" in
      this Rule shall be taken to refer to the Proposal of that
      Title which was Proposed by the same Player as the Proposal
      which created this Rule.  If there is more than one such
      Proposal, then the first and second paragraphs of this
      Rule are without effect.

      This Rule shall repeal itself at 12:00 GMT on 15 April 1998.

[Comment: Although this has a certain similarity to the recent
situation regarding impeachments, it was conceived of before
the impeachment situation was brought to light.
Part II will be proposed once Part I has been distributed.]

======================================================================
Proposal  3717 (Kolja A.) AI = 1
Zeitgeist and scarce currencies

Amend R1047 by replacing the sentence

      When an Interested Proposal Proposed by some Player is adopted
      with no votes cast AGAINST it, that Player is awarded the Patent
      Title of Zeitgeist.

with 

      When an Interested Proposal Proposed by some Player is adopted
      with no votes cast AGAINST it, and at least three different
      voting entities voted for it, that Player is awarded the Patent
      Title of Zeitgeist.

   3716 Chuck          1 CounterScam the Veto Scam, Part I

Style Change: +1

Tough call, this. I'm giving it +2 because it is a pretty Stylish
attempt to turn the GOV scam on the scammers, but I'm also giving it
-1 because the attempt appears to be flawed.

   3708 R-O-M          1 Repeal Rule 795 (Accurate Quoting Shall Not Be
                         Penalized)
Style Change: 0

In line with previous policy, R-O-M Proposals are Style neutral.

   3711 R-O-M          1 Repeal Rule 1644 (Dereliction of Duty)

Stlye Change: 0

   3712 R-O-M          1 Repeal Rule 1665 (Abuse of Responsibility)

Style Change: 0

A minor change, Style neutral.

   3718 Steve          1 Indelible Proposal voting

Proposed by the Wizard.

   3719 Swann          1 A minor Score Fix
