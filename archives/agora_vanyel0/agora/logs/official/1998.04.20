(Caller's) Arguments:

Rule 1775 says "Only a Player can have a Score" but doesn't say what
happens when an ex-Player re-registers.  As a candidate for
Scorekeepor, I'd like to know whether Time Agent will get his Score of
-13 back if e ever re-registers.


List of relevant Rules:


Rule 1775/0 (Power=1)
Points and Scoring

      Every Player has associated with em specific numerical value
      known as their Score.  A Player's Score shall always be an
      integer.  If the rules specify a non-integral change in a
      Player's Score, that change shall be rounded to the nearest
      integer before being applied.

      Only a Player can have a Score.

      Changes in a Player's Score can be referred to as a gain or
      loss of Points.  A gain of some number of Points means that
      number is to be added to a Player's Score, a loss of some number
      of Points means that number is to be subtracted from a Player's
      Score.

      This rule takes precedence over all other Rules dealing with
      Points and Scoring.
