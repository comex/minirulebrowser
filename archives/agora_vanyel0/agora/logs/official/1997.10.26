(Caller's) Arguments: 
 
At least when there are some VTs in the Bank, they'll have someplace 
to go - judicial salaries, y'know : -)

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

I dismiss this on the grounds that I feel like it.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Speaker:

In the Appeal of CFJ 1014 I hereby rule that Chuck's decision
was incorrect, insofar as he did not legally dismiss the CFJ 
in accordance with the requirements of R1565, for one of the 
reasons set out therein.

Now, it is obvious to all that the decision to dismiss is, in
and of itself, the correct one. What we have here is a case
of the right Judgement illegally submitted. Personally, had
I been the CotC, I probably would have rejected the Judgement
as illegal, listed Chuck as having defaulted, and re-assigned
the CFJ to a new Judge. But the CotC did accept the Judgement
as legally submitted, and I am not inclined to press the point.
Instead, I wish to consider what precedent to set for future
Justices faced with the Appeal of an illegally made Judgement.
It seems to me that the best course, as a matter of principle,
is re-assignment, and so I hereby order that the CFJ be re-assigned
to a new Judge.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Justiciar:

I sympathize with the Judge, but he erred in dismissing without giving a
legal reason as prescribed in Rule 1565.  In the words of Rule 1694, the
dismissal was not "properly made."

There is no need for the Board to recommend a specific action. If the Board
finds the dismissal was not properly made, the CFJ is to be reassigned by
the CotC.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning CotC:

Looking back at the case I agree with my fellow Justices. The Dismissal
was not properly made, as no legal reasons was given for the Dismissal.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge (Michael):

I dismiss this CFJ on the grounds that its statement is not relevant
to the Rules (reason (iii) of R1565 "Dismissal of a CFJ").

"Ross Morgan-Linial did not successfully transfer a Kudo from

  Assigned to General Chaos, 22 Oct 1997 21:52:17 +0200 (MET DST)
  Judged FALSE by General Chaos, 25 Oct 1997 00:33:20 -0500

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Arguments: R1478 says that "The Executor of an entity is a Player who 
is empowered by the Rules to act on behalf of that entity, as if e 
was that entity. Except when the Rules stipulate otherwise, a Player 
is eir own Executor." I argue that this should properly be read
to define any Player who can act on behalf of an entity as that
entity's Executor. Since, on October 14, Antimatter was not his
own executor, he could not act on his own behalf and thus his attempt
to transfer a Kudo failed.

Relevant Rules: R1478.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

In the matter of CFJ 1060, it is the opinion of the Judge that this
CFJ's Statement is FALSE.

My log of Public Forum messages includes a message from Ross
Morgan-Linial, also known as Antimatter, clearly requesting the
transfer of one Kudo from Harlequin to Blob (Exh. 1).  As far as I can
tell, Antimatter was a registered Player at the moment of this action
and had not previously transferred more than one Kudo during that
Nomic Week, and that Harlequin possessed at least one Kudo at that
time.  Therefore, the only question is whether Antimatter is empowered
to transfer Kudos at that time, in light of the fact that he was not
his own Executor.

I find that Antimatter's status as in Probate does not impair his
ability to execute Kudo transfers.  Rule 1378 states that a Kudo is
transferred when a Player sends a message to the Herald meeting
certain criteria.  Antimatter was, at the time in question, a Player,
and the message he sent satisfied the criteria of Rule 1378.
Therefore, the sending of that message is sufficient to effectuate a
Kudo Transfer, even though it was not sent by his Executor.

It has been argued that Antimatter is deprived of the power to make
Kudo Transfers because e is not eir own Executor.  I find this
argument lacking.  The Rules do not vest the power to make Kudo
Transfers in an Executor, as they do certain other powers, such as
Voting.  I do not see anything in Rule 1478 that prohibits a Player
who is not eir own Executor from exercising any power which the Rules
vest in Players directly, as long as that Player is actually capable
of acting on his own behalf (i.e. is not dead, unconscious, etc.).
Antimatter's status as an entity in Probate therefore does not deprive
him of his Rule 1378 power to effectuate Kudo transfers.

Judgement of FALSE is entered.

It is so ordered.

======================================================================

Evidence (added by Judge):

Exhibit 1: Public Forum Message from Antimatter

Date: Tue, 14 Oct 1997 08:22:43 -0700 (PDT)
From: Ross Morgan-Linial <rmorganl@fred.fhcrc.org>
Subject: BUS: Kudo Transfer
Sender: owner-agora-business@gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au

I transfer one Kudo FROM Harlequin, for being annoying in changing my
address, TO Blob, for being Zombified.

I transfer all of my assets to the Order of the Evil Eye, for safekeeping
until my return.

I deregister (again).

Antimatter
"Safekeeping". Right.
