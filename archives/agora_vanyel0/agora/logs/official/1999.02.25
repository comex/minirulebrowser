==========================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

At 20:22:57 EST on 2/7, I (as Promotor) erroneously attempted to
distribute a Proposal called 'The Grand Agoran Tournament' as Proposal
3830.  Since that number had already been used for another Proposal,
such distribution was invalid.  I discovered and announced my error at
20:51:49 EST, about a half-hour later, and distributed the same
Proposal as Proposal 3833 at 21:03:24 EST.

Vlad was aware of my error at as of 00:06:13 EST on 2/8, because he
claimed that the redistribution was in error.  Notwithstanding his
awareness of an error, he proceeded to cast eir votes at 00:11:01 EST.
It seems obvious that Vlad was aware, or should have been aware, that
there was an irregularity in the distribution.

In any case, at the time Vlad cast his votes, there were two Proposals
which a reasonable person might understand to be "Proposal 3830",
although legally only Blob's "Actions with N Supporters" Proposal
bears that number.  Vlad's reference to Proposal 3830 in his Votring
message was therefore ambiguous; hence, his message fails to
successfully communicate to the Assessor which Proposal e is
attempting to cast Votes upon.  Assessor Blob erred in counting these
Votes.

Since the miscounting of Vlad's Votes does not affect the outcome of
Proposal 3830, the only corrective action require is to vacate Payment
Orders avt083 and avt085, and I hereby move the Judge to do so.

Respectfully submitted,

General Chaos

==========================================================================
Judge Morendil's Arguments:

The message referred to in the Statement read as follows :

========================================
From:             Scott de Brestian <c647100@showme.missouri.edu>
Subject:          BUS: Votes on 3830-3832

I hereby cast the following votes:

Proposal 3830: FOR x 2
Proposal 3831: Present
Proposal 3832: Present
========================================

Notwithstanding the Caller's argument, I find that at the time Vlad
posted eir Voting message there did in fact exist one Proposal with
the number 3830, namely Blob's "Actions with N Supporters", the
Voting Period of which was still ongoing.

I am unconvinced by the Caller's contention that the above message
'fail[ed] to successfully communicate to the Assessor which Proposal
e [was] attempting to cast Votes upon'. The Rules do not mandate
that a message purporting to contain a Vote should unambiguously
express the voting Player's intent; all that they require is that
such a message clearly identify an existing Proposal, the Voting
Period of which is underway, which was the case.

I therefore enter a Judgement of FALSE.
