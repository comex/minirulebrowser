The Rule "Officer's Veto Scam" created by P3710 requires the Assessor,
Clerk of the Courts, Commander-in-Chief and the Speaker-Elect to report
any Wins that occur under the authority of the Rule "A Win for Threat",
also created by P3710. I note that R1638 sets out what such an announce-
ment must contain.

The Rules "Officer's Veto Scam" and "A Win for Threat" were created
at Mon, 09 Mar 1998 22:13:10 -0500, when the results of P3710 were
announced. At that time, I was the C-in-C; due to the Delegations I
am now the Assessor. In any case, I take it that I am required to
report (and I hereby do report) that the members of The Threat, Blob,
elJefe, General Chaos and Steve, all won the game when under the
authority of the Rule "A Win for Threat", at the time that Rule was
created. Swann also won the game at this time.

I remind Registrar Michael that the members of Threat each received
the Patent Title of "Threat to the Game" and that Swann received the
Patent Title of "Loose Cannon" at this time.
