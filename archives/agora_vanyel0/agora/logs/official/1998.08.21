======================================================================
                               CFJ 1104

  The presence in a Rule of deference clause, claiming that the Rule
  defers to another Rule, does not prevent a conflict with the other
  Rule arising, but shows only how the Rule says that conflict is to
  be resolved when it does arise.

======================================================================

Judge:        Harlequin

Judgement:

Eligible:     Antimatter, Blob, Chuck, Crito, General Chaos,
              Harlequin, Kolja A., lee, Macross, Morendil, Murphy


Not eligible:
Caller:       Steve
Barred:       Michael
Disqualified: -
On hold:      elJefe, Oerjan, Swann

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

The Statement follows from two assumptions, both of which it would be
extremely difficult to reject.

1. The Mirror Image Assumption

Precedence and deference are converse relations, logical mirror images
of each other. This simply means that if A claims to take precedence
over B, then this is logically equivalent to B's claiming to defer to A.

2. The Conflict Assumption

When A claims to take precedence over B, this does not prevent a
conflict between A and B arising. Rather we say that the conflict
exists, but is resolved in favour of A (other things being equal).

By the Conflict Assumption, precedence claims do not make conflicts
disappear, they just show how to resolve them when they arise. But
by the Mirror Image Assumption, the situation in which A claims to take
precedence over B is equivalent to one in which B claims to defer to A.
So this situation too must be one in which the conflict is not made to
disappear. This what the Statement claims.

I hereby order the Bank to pay Murphy his judicial salary of 1 VT. 

I also order the Scorekeepor to note that Murphy's score is to
increase by three points because he has judged a CFJ. 

======================================================================
                               CFJ 1103

  In the case of conflict between Rules of unequal Power, the higher
  Powered Rule cannot defer to the lower Powered Rule, unless the
  higher Powered Rule takes precedence over Rule 1482.

======================================================================

Judge:        Murphy

Judgement:    TRUE

Eligible:     Antimatter, Blob, Chuck, Crito, General Chaos,
              Harlequin, Kolja A., lee, Macross, Michael, Morendil,

  Judged TRUE, Fri, 21 Aug 1998 01:04:18 -0700
  Motion 1 granted, Fri, 21 Aug 1998 01:04:18 -0700
  Published, as of this message

======================================================================

Judgement: TRUE

Reasons and arguments:

I have nothing to add to the Caller's Arguments, except to note that
higher Powered Rules are generally able to defer to lower Powered
Rules by avoiding conflict (e.g. by saying "unless another Rule says
otherwise").

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

This follows directly from the wording of R1482, which states that:

      In a conflict between Rules with different Power, the Rule with
      the higher Power takes precedence over the Rule with the lower
      Power.


======================================================================

1. Motion to Annotate:

I hereby file a Motion with the Judge of this CFJ requesting that e
Order the Rulekeepor to Annotate R1482 with a copy of the
Statement. -- Steve

-> Scorekeepor, please note that this report contains work for you.


Agora Nomic
Ambassador's Report

Date of this Report: 21 August 1998

======================================================================
Diplomatic Report

Votes cast in the referenda in INP381/2 were as follows: 

              381   382
Crito          F     A
Kolja          A     A
Steve          A     A

Unfortunately, both referenda fail quorum. If I read 1632 correctly, a
referendum that fails quorum is not "undecided", so Agora will not
vote on these proposals at all. Please let me know if you disagree
with this reading.

H. Scorekeepor, please note:
Nevertheless, I hereby order that Crito's, Kolja's and Steve's score
be raised by one for voting on IN proposals.
