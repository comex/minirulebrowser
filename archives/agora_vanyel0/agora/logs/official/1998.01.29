Agora Nomic
Ambassador's Report

Date of this Report: 29 Jan 1998

======================================================================
Diplomatic Report


Contents: 

1. Agora results in INP360

2. IN results 357-358

3. New proposals INP 361, 362

4. Another SFJ defaulted


1. Result of Agora referendum on INP 360:

FOR: Crito, Jester, Murphy, Oerjan, Steve

AGAINST: Sherlock

PRESENT: Kolja A.

Quorum is ok, so I will vote for this. Thanks to all who voted.


2. INP 357 result: rejected

Pumpkin patch and Internomic voted against. I sent our for-vote late,
so it didn't get counted. I'm relieved to say, though, that our vote
wouldn't have changed the outcome.


INP358, 359: both rejected

We voted against these, Acka voted for.


3. New proposals:

INP 361 was submitted by New Rishonnomic:

>>>>>
  Amend the text of rule 215 to replace the string "New Rishonnomic"
with the string "New Rishonomic, New Rishonnomic".  Only perform the
replacement once, not recursively.
<<<<<

----------

INP 362 was submitted by Ackanomic:

No Navel Gazing

Amend Rule 212 by inserting ",and Internomic, should Internomic not be the
member who submitted it," immediately after the text "other than the
member who submitted it".


Voting in our referenda on both proposals lasts until Wed, 4 Feb 1998
00:06:47 -0500. Please vote.


4. Micronomic II has defaulted on SFJ 12 ("New Rishonomic (N E W space
R I S H O N O M I C) is a voting member of Internomic."). Once more,
the rules say nothing about what to do now.
