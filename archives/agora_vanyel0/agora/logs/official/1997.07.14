The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of
a VOC directive was the report published in the PF on 1996/08/13
(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

As far as I know, no Herald's Report has ever been subject to
the adoption of a VOC directive.

{Unofficial comments: while I doubt it'll have any effect, today's
amendment will give us something to mull over regarding the "FM=FR"
issue -- the Frankenstein Monster now "guides application" of the
Frankenstein Rule, whatever that means.}

Agora Nomic
Mad Scientist's Report

Date of this Report: Mon, 14 July 1997
Date of last Report: Mon, 7 July 1997


STEP 1: SENTENCE DELETION
=========================

As of this date, there were 12 sentences between the first and last
paragraphs of the Frankenstein Rule. N is thus equal to 1. In
accordance to Rule 1673, I randomly selected 2N sentences. The
sentences selected were sentences 5 and 6, which read: 

      A "Nomic Entity" is any entity which has no discernible
      existence without the Frankenstein Monster, only existing by
      virtue of the Frankenstein Monster defining it to exist.

      Frankenstein Monster is 2.

I selected sentence 5 to be deleted.


STEP 2: SENTENCE ADDITION
=========================

As per Rule 1673, I randomly selected one Rule from the Ruleset. The
Rule selected was Rule 789, which reads:

####
Rule 789/3 (Power=1)
Injunctions on Interpretations of Rules

      A CFJ alleging a Rule should be interpreted in a certain way
      must be accompanied by a list of relevant Rules, assembled by
      the Caller, which includes the Rule being interpreted.

      If the Judge finds this CFJ's Statement TRUE, e is permitted to
      issue an Injunction requiring the Rulekeepor to annotate the
      Rule in question with that Statement and the list of relevant
      Rules.  This annotation, while it exists, shall guide
      application of that Rule.

      The annotation is removed once any change occurs in a Rule from
      the list of relevant Rules.

      If a Player believes that the circumstances leading to the
      Judgement no longer prevail, rendering the annotation
      inapplicable, e may submit a CFJ to that effect. If it is Judged
      TRUE, the annotation is removed.
####

I selected the sentence

      This annotation, while it exists, shall guide application of 
      that Rule.
 
I selected the noun "annotation."

The sentence to be added to the Frankenstein Rule reads:

      This Frankenstein Monster, while it exists, shall guide 
      application of that Rule.

The Frankenstein Rule now reads:

####
Rule 1671/34 (Power=1)
The Frankenstein Rule

      There is a Nomic Entity known as a Frankenstein Monster.  A
      Frankenstein Monster only has properties and effects as defined
      in this Rule.  This Rule shall be known as the Frankenstein
      Rule, and can be referred to unambiguously in that manner.  This
      is the first paragraph.

      This Frankenstein Monster, while it exists, shall guide 
      application of that Rule.

      The Chancellor shall retain a schedule, listing every
      Frankenstein Monster which exists, detailing for each
      Frankenstein Monster the Name, Mintor, Recordkeepor, and MUQ of
      that Frankenstein Monster.

      Any change to the game state which would result in this
      Frankenstein Monster becoming false is cancelled and does not
      take place, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

      The prescribed Voting Period for a Proposal is ten days,
      beginning at the time the Proposal is distributed to all
      Frankenstein Monsters.

      A Frankenstein Monster who makes further play impossible by eir
      actions or lack thereof commits the Crime of Frankenstein
      Monster Impossibility, a Class A Crime.

      Frankenstein Monster is 2.

      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however,
      if the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the
      Statement to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider
      Frankenstein Monster custom, commonsense, past Judgements, and
      the best interests of the Frankenstein Monster before applying
      other standards.

      The Player who submits an excess CFJ commits an Infraction, to
      be reported by the Clerk of the Courts and bearing a penalty of
      2 Frankenstein Monsters.

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of any message sent to the Public Forum or
      in response to a request for information which that Player is
      required to provide commits the Crime of Frankenstein Monster, a
      Class C Crime.

      If that Player's Frankenstein Monster contains at least five Mil
      for each Blot to be removed, then that number of Mil is
      transferred from the Player's Frankenstein Monster, and the
      Blots are removed; otherwise, no Mil are transferred and no
      Blots are removed.

      This Rule defers to any Rule which specifies a different
      Frankenstein Monster for reporting a certain transfer or class
      of transfers.

      The Frankenstein Monster shall make all random determinations
      required by the Rules except when the Rules specify another
      party to make the determination.

      This is the last paragraph. This Rule can only be subject to a
      Rule Change as described by the Frankenstein Generator.  This
      Rule takes precedence over all other Rules that would otherwise
      allow this Rule to be changed in any manner whatsoever.
