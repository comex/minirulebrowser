THE SHORT LOGICAL RULESET



======================================================================
The Game of Agora
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1020/0 (Power=3)
Name Is Agora

      The Official Name of this Nomic shall be Agora.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 101/0 (Power=3)
Obey the Rules

      All Players must always abide by all the Rules then in effect,
      in the form in which they are then in effect.  The Rules in the
      Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the first game.
      The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (Immutable) and
      201-219 (Mutable).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 116/0 (Power=3)
Permissibility of the Unprohibited

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
      and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
      which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly
      or implicitly permits it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1011/3 (Power=2)
Game Entities May Not Be Arbitrarily Changed

      A "Nomic Property" is any property of any entity which that
      entity possesses solely by the virtue of the Rules defining that
      property.

      No Nomic Property shall be changed except in accordance with
      procedures specified by the Rules.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1527/2 (Power=1)
Timing of Multiple Events in One Message

      Whenever a message contains more than one notification, report,
      or other communication in which the Rules place some legal
      significance, the communications in that message shall be taken
      to have been sent sequentially, separated by infinitesimal
      increments of time, in the order which they appear in the
      message.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1600/1 (Power=1)
Standard Mathematics

      Except where the Rules explicitly state otherwise, any
      mathematical term in the Rules shall be construed to have the
      definition usually given to it in standard mathematics.  In
      particular,  "number" shall mean  "real number."

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 754/3 (Power=1)
Spelling and Grammar Errors

      Differences in spelling, grammar, or dialect, or the
      substitution of a word or phrase by a synonym or abbreviation,
      are inconsequential in all forms of Nomic communication, as long
      as there is no ambiguity in meaning. In other words, the meaning
      or validity of such communication is not altered in any way by
      such discrepancies.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 795/2 (Power=1)
Accurate Quoting Shall Not Be Penalized

      When a Player quotes a Rule, Proposal, Statement, Judgement, the
      words of another Player, or other references, that Player shall
      not be penalized in any way for the terminology or grammar used
      in those quotes.

      For the purpose of this Rule, a gain or loss of Kudos by any
      means shall not be construed as a punishment.

      This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which specifies
      terminology or grammar.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1497/4 (Power=1)
Truth in Advertising

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of any message sent to the Public Forum or
      in response to a request for information which that Player is
      required to provide commits the Crime of Misrepresentation, a
      Class C Crime.

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of a message to an Officer which that
      Officer is then required to act upon commits the Crime of
      Falsification, a Class C Crime.

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of evidence in a Claim of Error, Call for
      Judgement, or Judgement commits the Crime of Perjury, a Class B
      Crime.

      A Player shall never be convicted of more than one of the above
      Crimes for the same act.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1478/2 (Power=1)
Executors

      The Executor of an entity is a Player who is empowered by the
      Rules to act on behalf of that entity, as if e was that entity.

      Except when the Rules stipulate otherwise, a Player is eir own
      Executor.  Any other entity has an Executor only when the Rules
      specify either a Player or a means to designate a Player to be
      the Executor of that entity.

      Whenever a Player is acting on behalf of some entity of which e
      is the Executor other than emself, e must make it clear that e
      is doing so.  If such a Player fails to clearly indicate that e
      is acting as the Executor of some other entity, it shall be
      presumed that e is acting on eir own behalf.

      A Nomic Entity (other than a person who is not a Player) which
      has no Executor, or whose Executor is not a Player, may not
      perform any action except when required to do so by the Rules.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1630/2 (Power=1)
Impersonation

      Any Player who knowingly attempts to act as, or purports to be,
      the Executor of an Entity, of which e is not the Executor,
      commits the Crime of Impersonation, a Class C Crime.

----------------------------------------------------------------------



======================================================================

Rule 1727/3 (Power=1)
Happy Birthday

      WHEREAS, in June 1993, the world's only MUD-based nomic, Nomic
      World, had recently collapsed; yet, many of its players enjoyed
      nomic and did not wish to forego such a noble pursuit;

      And WHEREAS, Originator Chuck Carroll therefore composed an
      Initial Ruleset for an email nomic, based on the Initial
      Rulesets of Peter Suber, inventor of Nomic, and on the Rulesets
      of Nomic World and other nomics,

      And WHEREAS, a nomic thus rose like a phoenix from the ashes of
      Nomic World, played on the mailing list originally set up for
      discussion of Nomic World, and coming into existence at June 30,
      1993, 00:04:30 GMT +1200, with a message sent by First Speaker
      Michael Norrish, which read, in part,

       "I see no reason to let this get bogged down; there are no
        precedents or rules that cover this situation, so I think we
        may as well begin directly.... Proposals for new rules are
        invited. In accordance with the rules, these will be
        published, numbered and distributed by me at my earliest
        convenience."

      And WHEREAS, this nomic began as a humble and nameless nomic,
      known unofficially as yoyo, after the mailing list it was played
      on, until its Players, much later, gave it its official name of
      Agora,

      And WHEREAS, Agora has now become the wisest, noblest, eldest,
      and most interesting of all active email nomics, due to the hard
      work and diligence of Agorans as well as the frequent advice of
      Agoraphobes,

      And WHEREAS, Agorans desire to joyously commemorate Agora's
      founding,

      BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED that Agora's Birthday is defined to be
      the entire day of June 30, GMT +1200, of each year;

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that prior to, but not more than seven
      days before, Agora's Birthday, the Ambassador shall announce
      Agora's upcoming Birthday to all Friendly nomics;

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that, not less than seven days prior to
      Agora's Birthday, the Chancellor shall, on behalf of the Bank,
      submit delayed Transfer Orders to be executed at 00:04:30 GMT
      +1200 on Agora's Birthday to each Player for the amount of 3 VTs
      each;

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Chancellor shall, on behalf of
      the Bank, submit Transfer Orders for one P-note each from the
      Bank to each Player who posts to the Public Forum during Agora's
      Birthday a message recognizing Agora's Birthday; these Transfer
      Orders to be executed as soon as possible after Agora's Birthday
      ends;

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Notary may select up to three
      Contests, in existence on Agora's Birthday, which have as their
      purpose encouraging the celebration of Agora's Birthday; and
      which Contests, in the Notary's estimation, are worthy of
      recognition for this effort; and shall pay out to each such
      Contest 5 VTs, and to their Contestmasters 2 P-Notes each;

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Courts shall be closed on
      Agora's Birthday; that is, the Clerk of the Courts shall not
      publish any Calls For Judgement, Judgements, notices of Appeals,
      Decisions of Appeals Boards, or Opinions, on Agora's Birthday;
      nor shall any Player submit to the Clerk of the Courts a Call
      For Judgement, notice of ineligibility to Judge, Judgement,
      call for Appeal, or Appellate Decision, on Agora's Birthday; nor
      shall any Player Execute an Application to Submit an Opinion on
      Agora's Birthday; however, if any of the above do take place on
      Agora's Birthday, in violation of this Rule, this Rule does not
      deprive them of their usual effects.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1586/1 (Power=1)
Definition and Continuity of Entities

      A "Nomic Entity" is any entity which has no discernible
      existence without the Rules, only existing by virtue of the
      Rules defining it to exist.  No two Nomic Entities (including
      Players) shall have the same name or nickname.

      When the Rules defining a given Nomic Entity are repealed or
      amended such that they no longer define that entity, that entity
      ceases to exist, along with any properties it may have
      possessed.

      When the Rules defining a given Nomic Entity are amended such
      that they still define the Entity but in a different way or with
      different properties, that entity and its properties continue to
      exist to whatever extent is possible under the new definition.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 478/10 (Power=1)
The Public Forum

      Whether a given medium is a Public Forum or not is a Nomic
      Property.  The Registrar is authorized to change whether a given
      medium is a Public Forum or not Without Objection.  When such
      a change is made, in order to be effective, the message
      announcing the change must be sent to both a medium that was a
      Public Forum before the change, and a medium that is a Public
      Forum after the change.  (If a single medium is a Public Forum
      both before and after the change, a single message to that
      medium satisfies this requirement.)

      It is the responsibility of each Active Player to ensure that e
      is able to receive messages sent to every medium which the
      Registrar has designated as a Public Forum.  The temporary
      inability of a Player to receive a Public Forum does not deprive
      that medium of any legal significance as a Public Forum.

      Sending a message, by any medium or combination of media, to
      every Active Player, is equivalent to sending it to the Public
      Forum, provided that the message bears a clear indication that
      it is intended to be a message to the Public Forum, and it is
      verifiable that the message was in fact sent to every Active
      Player.

      Whenever the Rules call upon some Player to "announce", "post",
      or "distribute" some communication or notification, this shall
      be accomplished by posting the communication or notification to
      the Public Forum, unless another rule specifies otherwise.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 459/1 (Power=1)
The Nomic Week

      The Nomic Week begins at midnight, GMT, each Monday. Any
      automatic change in the state of the Game which must occur
      weekly occurs at the beginning of the Nomic Week. Any
      automatic change which must occur monthly occurs at midnight,
      GMT, on the first of the month.  Any automatic change which must
      occur quarterly occurs at midnight, GMT, on the first day of
      each calendar quarter.

      This Rule defers to any Rule that defines another explicit
      schedule for events.  Any activity that must be performed at
      least weekly, monthly, or quarterly, must occur at least once in
      the given period.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1274/1 (Power=3)
Definition of Indices

      Let there be a class of Entities known as "Indices" (singular:
      "Index").  An Index shall have a value, which is either a
      non-negative real number or the special value "Unanimity".

      An Index of Unanimity is greater than any other Index.  When
      comparing other Indices, the Index which is numerically greater
      is the greater Index.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1688/0 (Power=3)
Power

      There shall exist a property of entities known as Power.  The
      Power of an entity is an Index, as described elsewhere.

      An "instrument" is any entity with Power greater than zero.

      The Power of any given entity is zero until and unless it is set
      to another value in accordance with the Rules.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1869/0 (Power=3)
Restrictions on Setting Power

      Except as described in this Rule, no entity can set the Power
      of another entity to exceed the Power of the entity causing
      the Power to be so set.  A Rule may set the Power of an adopted
      Proposal, even exceeding the Power of the Rule, so long as the
      Power of the adopted Proposal does not exceed the Voting Index
      of that Proposal.

      No entity may destroy or repeal an entity with Power greater
      than its own.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1023/10 (Power=2)
Definition of "As Soon As Possible"

      Whenever a Player is required to perform a certain action
      "as soon as possible", then:

           if the action is one that a Player is required to
           perform in the course of carrying out Official
           duties, then the Player is required to perform the
           action within a week, and no earlier than any other
           action which the performance of the duties of that
           Office already requires em to perform as soon as
           possible;

           otherwise, e is required to perform that action within a
           week, and no earlier than any other action e is already
           required to perform as soon as possible which is not an
           action performed in the course of carrying out Official
           duties.

      A Player who fails to observe these requirements commits the
      Infraction of Tardiness, the penalty for which shall be the
      same as that for a Class D Crime. All Players are authorized to
      detect and report the commission of the Infraction of Tardiness.

      Activity of a purely discussionary nature is excluded from the
      ordering requirement, and may be conducted at any time.

      This Rule does not deprive actions which do not conform to its
      requirements of whatever effects they would otherwise have.
      Rather, this Rule defines the latest time at which actions to be
      performed "as soon as possible" may be performed without
      incurring a Penalty.  It takes precedence over other Rules which
      define a later latest time for the performance of these actions.
      Other Rules may impose earlier latest times, and if so, this
      Rule defers to them.

      This Rule defers to Rules which describe the responsibilities of
      Players who are On Hold, and to any Rules which impose different
      requirements on the timing of Official Duties.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1079/2 (Power=1)
Definition of "Random"

      When a rule requires a random choice, that choice shall be made
      among all the possible choices with equal probability.

      Because of the impossibility of finding a truly random test,
      "equal", for the purposes of the above statement, shall mean
      "reasonably close to equal".  It is up to common sense to
      determine what is reasonably close to equal; however, the burden
      of proof of a method's randomness lies with the Player who used
      the method.

      The probability of a Platonic solid or coin, which is not
      specially weighted, falling on any given face is, for the
      purposes of this Rule, close enough to equal to satisfy the
      above requirement.

      The Speaker shall make all random determinations required by the
      Rules except when the Rules specify another party to make the
      determination.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1769/0 (Power=2)
Holidays

      A Holiday is a period of time, not to exceed 7 days in length,
      designated as such by the Rules.  If one Holiday begins
      within 24 hours of the end of another Holiday, the two Holidays
      and the time between them are taken as a single Holiday, unless
      this would cause the combined Holiday to exceed 7 days in
      length, in which case the first Holiday is extended to 7 days
      and the second Holiday does not occur.

      During a Holiday, no Proposal may be distributed by the
      Promotor, nor may any Call for Judgement, Judgement, notice of
      Appeal, Decision of Appeals Boards, or Opinion be published by
      the Clerk of the Courts; however, if any of the above do take
      place during the Holiday in violation of this Rule, this Rule
      does not deprive them of their usual effects.

      If some Rule requires that an action be done prior to a
      given time, and that given time falls during a Holiday, or
      within the twenty-four-hour period immediately following that
      Holiday, then that action need not be done until twenty-four
      hours after that Holiday ends.  If some Rule bases the time of a
      future event upon the time of another event, or requires that a
      Player perform some action within some time of another event,
      and that event occurs during a Holiday, the time at which the
      Holiday ends shall be used instead for the purpose of
      determining the time of the future event or of the time by which
      the Player must perform the specified action.

      This Rule takes precedence over all Rules pertaining to the
      timing of events, and over all Rules which require Players to
      perform events before a specified time.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1787/0 (Power=1)
April Fool's Day

      A break from all the stress and strife
         and matters of much gravity,
      is what this Nomic sorely needs:
         a dithyramb to levity!

      In order that, just once a year,
         our hearts be light and gay,
      Let April Fool's Day, every year
         become a Holiday!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1870/0 (Power=1)
Merry Christmas, Agora

      The period commencing every year at midnight GMT December 25,
      and concluding at midnight GMT January 1 is a Holiday.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1750/0 (Power=1)
Read the Ruleset Week

      In each year, the first Nomic Week falling entirely in
      February shall be designated "Read the Ruleset Week".

----------------------------------------------------------------------



======================================================================
The Rules
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 114/1 (Power=3)
Rules Can Always Be Changed

      It must always be possible to make arbitrary modifications to
      the ruleset by some combination of player actions.  Any change
      to the gamestate that would cause this condition to become false
      does not occur, any rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

CFJ 920, Apr. 17 1997: Rule 114 should be interpreted such that a
change to the rules such that they instantaneously thereafter do not
permit modification of the rules is not prevented from occurring by
Rule 114 if it leaves the gamestate such that after some definite
finite or infinitesemal time interval the rules will again change such
that the gamestate then satisfies Rule 114's condition.
Relevant Rules: 114

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1692/4 (Power=1)
Power of Rules

      No Rule may have Power less than 1 or greater than 4.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1482/1 (Power=3)
Precedence between Rules with Unequal Power

      In a conflict between Rules with different Power, the Rule with
      the higher Power takes precedence over the Rule with the lower
      Power.

CFJ 1103 (Judged TRUE, Aug. 21 1998): "In the case of conflict
 between Rules of unequal Power, the higher Powered Rule cannot defer
 to the lower Powered Rule, unless the higher Powered Rule takes
 precedence over Rule 1482."

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1030/4 (Power=3)
Precedence between Rules with Equal Power

      If two or more Rules with the same Power conflict with one
      another, then the Rule with the lower Number takes precedence.

      If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of Rule) or
      takes precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supercede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.

      If all of the Rules in conflict explicitly say that their
      precedence relations are determined by some other Rule for
      determining precedence relations, then the determinations of
      the precedence determining Rule shall supercede the numerical
      method for determining precedence.

      If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

CFJ 1104 (Judged TRUE, Sep. 9 1998): "The presence in a Rule of
 deference clause, claiming that the Rule defers to another Rule, does
 not prevent a conflict with the other Rule arising, but shows only
 how the Rule says that conflict is to be resolved when it does
 arise."

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1513/1 (Power=1)
Authority of Non-Rule Entities

      It is legal for the Rules to grant the power to require Players
      to perform (or not perform) actions to Nomic Entities created in
      accordance with the Rules.  Such Entities shall have whatever
      power is granted to them by the Rules.  In the event that the
      requirements of such an Entity conflicts with the Rules, the
      Rules shall always take precedence.

      If two or more such Entities conflict with one another, then the
      relative precedence of the respective Rules which grant coercive
      Power to the Entities in conflict shall determine which
      requirements take precedence.  If two or more Entities which are
      authorized by the same Rule conflict, then the Entity which was
      created first under the authority of that Rule takes precedence
      over the others.

      No Nomic Entity is permitted to require a Player to perform or
      not perform an action unless the information of which actions
      can be required of em by that Entity has been previously
      provided to that Player. Especially, no body of text is
      permitted to require Players to perform or not perform any
      actions unless said body of text has previously been made
      available to that Player.

----------------------------------------------------------------------



======================================================================
The Players
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 869/7 (Power=1)
Registered Players

      A Player is any person who is registered as a Player.
      A person is Registered to play when e sends a message to the
      Public Forum requesting Registration; this Rule defers to Rules
      which would prevent such a Registration.

      If a Player has to be identified for whatever purpose, then the
      use of that Player's Agora nickname is preferred, but not
      obligatory: *any* unambiguous way of identification is allowed.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1676/2 (Power=1)
Grace Period for New Players

      Whenever a person registers as a Player in Agora, and that
      person has not been registered as a Player in Agora at any time
      within the 12 months prior to this registration, e is subject to
      a Grace Period that begins at the time of eir registration and
      ends two months afterwards.

      A Player is only subject to the Grace Period resulting from eir
      own registration.

      The Registrar shall maintain a list of all Grace Periods that
      are in progress.  For each such Grace Period this list shall
      include the Player subject to the Grace Period, the time at
      which it started, and the time at which it will end.  This list
      is known as the Pink Pages, and is part of the Registrar's
      Report.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1677/5 (Power=1)
Currency Awards for New Players

      As soon as possible after the start of a Player's Grace Period,
      the Registrar shall pay out 5 Voting Tokens and 1 P-Note to that
      Player.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1432/1 (Power=2)
Player Uniqueness

      If a Person becomes a Player, then ceases to be a Player, then
      becomes a Player once again, the Person becomes the same Player
      as e was previously.  Further, no person may be registered as a
      Player more than once concurrently.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 113/2 (Power=3)
Players May Always Opt Out

      A Player other than the Speaker may always deregister from the
      Game rather than continue to play or incur a Game penalty.  No
      penalty worse than deregistration, in the judgment of the Player
      to incur it, may be imposed.

CFJ 826, Nov. 15 1995: Rule 113 should be interpreted such that, even
if a Player considers a penalty to be worse than deregistration, e is
still subject to it unless e actually deregisters or is deregistered.
Relevant Rules: 113

CFJ 853, Feb. 2 1996: Rule 113 should be interpreted such that it does
not allow a Player to deregister retroactively.
Relevant Rules: 113

CFJ 856, Feb. 20 1996: Rule 113/1 should be interpreted to mean simply
that a Player may always deregister from the Game rather than continue
to play.  The other language in the Rule is merely a gloss on that
basic content, illustrating some of its implications;it does not
change the essential meaning of the Rule.
Relevant Rules: 113

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 103/1 (Power=3)
The Speaker may not deregister

      At any time, there is exactly one Player who is the Speaker. The
      Speaker may not deregister or be deregistered for any reason,
      any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 104/0 (Power=3)
First Speaker

      The Speaker for the first game shall be Michael Norrish.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1016/11 (Power=2)
Putting Oneself On Hold

      At any time, each Player shall either be On Hold or Off Hold.
      This status shall not be changed except as specified in the
      Rules.

      When a Player registers (or reregisters), e is Off Hold.

      An Off Hold Player becomes On Hold when e announces in the
      Public Forum that e goes On Hold.

      An On Hold Player becomes Off Hold when e announces in the
      Public Forum that e comes Off Hold.  E may not do so until at
      least 96 hours after e last went On Hold.

      "Active" and "Inactive" are unambiguous synonyms for "Off Hold"
      and "On Hold", respectively.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1584/0 (Power=2)
Absolvement of Duty for On Hold Players

      An On Hold Player is not permitted to Vote on Proposals, make
      Proposals, or hold Office, and cannot be required by the Rules
      to perform any duty or action, unless that Rule specifically
      states that it can require On Hold Players to perform actions.

      This Rule takes precedence over every other Rule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1043/4 (Power=1)
Deregistration

      A Player other than the Speaker may deregister from Agora by
      sending a message to the Public Forum announcing eir
      deregistration. A Player who deregisters in this fashion ceases
      to be a Player effective at the time date-stamped on that
      message, and any attempts by em to reregister before thirty days
      have passed are without effect. This Rule takes precedence over
      Rules which would cause em to be reregistered before thirty days
      have passed after eir deregistration.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1042/9 (Power=1)
Deregistration Due to Silence

      Each Player is either Noisy, Quiet or Silent. Whenever a Player
      posts to the Public Forum, or a new Player registers, that
      Player is Noisy.

      Any Player can cause another Active Noisy Player to become
      Quiet by stating that e is doing so, and clearly identifying
      that Player, in the Public Forum.  If a Player has been Quiet
      continuously for two weeks, e becomes Silent.  If a Player has
      been Inactive continuously for two months, e becomes Silent.

      Any Player can cause a Silent Player to be deregistered by
      stating in the Public Forum that the Silent Player has
      Abandoned the game. If the Speaker is Silent, and it is alleged
      in the Public Forum that e has Abandoned the Game, e commits
      the Class A Crime of Speaker Abandonment. E ceases to be
      Speaker, and the Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker. E is then
      deregistered. In either case, the Registrar shall, as soon as
      possible after an allegation in the Public Forum that a Player
      has Abandoned the game, confirm or deny in the Public Forum
      that the deregistration has actually occurred.

      The Registrar shall include in eir Report the most recent
      date on which each Player changed from being Noisy, Quiet or
      Silent to any of the others.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1789/0 (Power=1)
Cantus Cygneus

      Whenever a Player feels that e has been treated so egregiously
      by the Agoran community that e can no longer abide to be a part
      of it, e may submit a document to the Clerk of the Courts,
      clearly labeled a Cantus Cygneus, detailing eir grievances and
      expressing eir reproach for those who ey feel have treated em so
      badly.

      As soon as possible after receiving a Cantus Cygneus, the Clerk
      of the Courts shall post this document to the Public Forum along
      with a Writ of Fugere Agorae Grandissima Exprobratione,
      commanding the Player to be deregistered and instructing the
      Registrar to note the method of deregistration for that Player
      in subsequent Registrar Reports, as long as the Player remains
      deregistered.

      The Player is deregistered as of the posting of the Writ, and
      the notation in the Registrar's Report will ensure that,
      henceforth, all may know said Player deregistered in a Writ of
      FAGE.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1755/0 (Power=1)
No Non-Player Responsibilities

      When a player becomes deregistered, e ceases to be a candidate,
      officer, judge, or executor in probate, or in general to occupy
      any role or position to which a Rule assigns any duties or
      powers.  Noone who is not registered may occupy such a role or
      position.  This rule takes precedence over rules which would
      prevent em from ceasing to occupy such a role or position.

      The foregoing paragraph shall not apply to the holding of Patent
      Titles, or any position which a Rule specifically says may be
      held by a non-Player, nor shall it act to prevent a nonPlayer
      from registering, calling CFJs, or doing things that nonPlayers
      generally are able to do.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1841/0 (Power=1)
Granting Power of Attorney

      Any Player who has been continuously registered for two or more
      months is empowered to give another willing Player eir Power of
      Attorney for a specified period of time.  The giving Player
      shall be known, for this Rule, as the Grantor.  The receiving
      Player shall be known, for this Rule, as the Holder.

      Power of Attorney is given by the Grantor posting in the Public
      Forum, naming the Holder e is giving the Power of Attorney to,
      and the time period for which the Power of Attorney shall given.
      To be effective, this post must name a time that begins within
      the week following the posting. The Power of Attorney shall not
      be granted unless the Holder is an active Player and consents in
      the Public Forum before the beginning of the specified period of
      time.

      If the grant is effective, the Holder shall then have the Power
      of Attorney beginning at the specified time.  This grant shall
      end when one of the following occurs;

        i) The period specified expires.
       ii) The Grantor posts in the Public Forum that e is withdrawing
           eir Power of Attorney.
      iii) The Grantor is deregistered, or goes On Hold.
       iv) The Holder is deregistered, or goes On Hold
        v) It has been over three months since the Grantor gave eir
           Power of Attorney to the Holder.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1842/0 (Power=1)
Power of Attorney

      In certain specified circumstances the Rules may grant one
      Player, hereafter called the Holder, Power of Attorney for
      another Player, hereafter called the Grantor.  Such a grant
      shall only occur when specified by the Rules, and shall last
      only as long as the Rules permit.

      When the Holder is granted Power of Attorney for the Grantor,
      that means that the Holder becomes the sole Executor for the
      Grantor for as long as e has that Power of Attorney.

      No Player is permitted to have Power of Attorney for more than
      two other Players.

----------------------------------------------------------------------



======================================================================
Officers
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1006/6 (Power=1)
Defaults for Officers

      An Office is a position of authority or responsibility
      established by the Rules and held by a Player, who is called an
      Officer.

      At any time, an Office is held by exactly one Player; if no
      other Rule directly or indirectly specifies which Player holds
      an Office, it shall be held by the Speaker.

      A position of responsibility or authority is only an Office if
      the Rules specifically designate it as such.  An Office only
      exists as long as there is a Rule in force which specifies that
      it exists.  If the Rule or Rules which mandated the existence of
      an Office are changed such that they no longer do so, that
      Office ceases to exist.

      A given Office has whatever duties, responsibilities, and
      privileges that the Rules assign to it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1686/0 (Power=1)
Official Reports

      For each Office, the Rules may designate a set of information to
      be the corresponding Officer's Report.  All such Reports are
      Official Reports.  The only information that is part of an
      Official Report is that which the Rules specifically state is
      part of that Official Report.

      The holder of an Office for which there is an Official Report
      shall maintain all information in the Report, and shall post it
      to the Public Forum at least once every Nomic Week.  Failure to
      post the Official Report is the Infraction of Failure to Report,
      the penalty for which is the same as the penalty for a Class D
      Crime.  The Registrar and the Speaker are authorised to detect
      and report commissions of this Infraction.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1064/7 (Power=1)
Freedom of Information Act

      If a Player is mandated by the Rules to maintain a set of
      records, these records must be available for public perusal,
      unless such records are designated by the Rules as private.  A
      Player who maintains such records must provide a copy of these
      Records to any other Player upon request within one week.  If e
      fails to so provide a copy of the requested records within one
      week, e commits Unlawful Nondisclosure, a Class D Crime, unless
      the Records are unavailable for reasons beyond eir control and e
      reports this fact, with explanation, within one week.

      For the purpose of this Rule, all records pertaining to Votes
      currently in progress, excluding the text of the Proposals under
      consideration, are designated as private until the end of the
      Voting Period.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1431/10 (Power=1)
Claims of Error

      A Claim of Error is a message posted to the Public Forum to the
      effect that a specific post to the Public Forum misrepresents
      the actual Game State, and documenting the nature of the error.

      A Response to a Claim of Error consists in posting to the Public
      Forum either a denial of the Claim or an admission of the
      Claim. If the Claim is admitted, then the Player making the
      admission is required to post a corrected version of the
      relevant portion of the message which was in error, before one
      week passes from the time the Claim of Error was made. A Player
      who admits a Claim but does not publish a correction is deemed
      not to have Responded to that Claim.

      A Response must be provided by the Player who is required by the
      Rules to publish the information subject to a Claim within one
      week of the Claim being made, unless any of the following holds:
       * a previous Claim was made concerning the same error
       * the relevant message has been posted more than 21 days before
       * another message by the same Player has corrected the error

      A Player who fails to post a Response within the alloted time
      commits the Infraction of Delayed COE Response, carrying a
      penalty of 1 Blot, to be reported by the Player who posted the
      Claim. A Player who incorrectly issues a denial of a Claim
      commits the Crime of Wrongful COE Denial, a Class 1 Crime,
      unless e then admits the Claim within 72 hours after the
      incorrect denial.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1550/2 (Power=1)
Ratification

      Any Official Document (as specified in other Rules) may be
      ratified by the operation of an adopted Proposal (but no other
      sort of instrument).  The instrument must specify an Official
      Document (as specified in other Rules) which is subject to
      ratification.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1791/0 (Power=1)
Ratification Without Objection

      Any Officer who holds an Office in Normal Fashion can Ratify an
      Official Report Without Objection, provided the following
      conditions hold;

        i) The Report to be Ratified is one that is legally
           permissible to Ratify.
       ii) The Report to be Ratified was produced by the Player
           holding the Office.
      iii) The Report to be Ratified is one that is required to be
           produced and maintained by the Officer.

      A Speaker who is not Tainted is permitted to Ratify any Official
      Report Without Objection provided that the Report is one legally
      permissible to Ratify.

      A COE on any Report undergoing this process shall be deemed by
      the Rules to constitute an Objection.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1551/3 (Power=1)
Documents Subject to Ratification

      The ratification of an Official Document conforms the Game State
      to what it would be if the valid Official Document thus ratified
      was completely true and accurate at the time of the Document's
      publication in the Public Forum.  In other words, the State of
      the Game, upon such ratification, becomes that specified within
      the Document, plus all subsequent legal changes between the time
      of its publication and its ratification.

      All Game State changes due to the ratification of an Official
      Document occur at the time of such ratification; no retroactive
      effect is expressed or implied.

      A Document, once ratified, is for all legal purposes a true and
      accurate report.  The Game State it references may not be
      retroactively modified prior to the time it was published in the
      Public Forum, even to reflect a prior mistake, retracted or
      illegal move, or an Order.  This Rule takes precedence over
      any Rule that would allow such retroactive alterations or
      corrections to the Game State.

      In no way does the ratification of a Document invalidate,
      reverse, alter or cancel any prior moves or transfers, even
      unrecorded or overlooked ones.  Nor does the ratification of a
      Document change the legality or illegality of any prior move.
      Ratification only adjusts the actual Game State to conform to
      that perceived by the Players and Officers in Official
      Documentation.

      After a Document has been ratified, the Player in charge of
      maintaining that Document shall annotate all subsequent
      publications of that Document with the date of publication of
      the last such publication that was ratified..

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1552/2 (Power=1)
Requirements for Ratification

      In order for an Official Document to be valid for the purpose of
      a Ratification, it must satisfy all the following criteria at
      the time the Proposal which would Ratify it is Proposed:

           i) The Rules require some specific Player to produce and/or
              maintain the document.
          ii) The Rules required it to be published in the Public
              Forum.  (A requirement that it be sent to all Players
              fulfills this criterion.)
         iii) It is not currently subject to a Claim of Error. (COE)
          iv) It is not currently subject to a pending Call for
              Judgement (CFJ), or a pending Appeal of a CFJ.
           v) The information within the Document has not been
              superseded by a subsequent Document.
          vi) The Document is not the Ruleset. The Ruleset is
              specifically excluded from Ratification.

      Further, a Document can become invalid during the Voting Period
      of a Proposal which would Ratify it if any of the following
      occurs:

           i) The Document is superseded by a subsequent Document
              which contradicts the information in the prior Document.
              This does not apply if there is a COE alleging the
              contradiction is an error, and the error is admitted
              before the end of the Proposal's Voting Period.
          ii) A COE is made on the Document, and the COE has not been
              denied before the end of the Proposal's Voting
              Period.
         iii) The Document becomes subject to a pending CFJ or a
              pending appeal of a CFJ.

       If, during the Voting Period of a Proposal to Ratify a
       Document, another Document is issued that does not contradict
       the prior Document, it does not alter the validity of the prior
       Document.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1555/3 (Power=1)
Electees and Removal from Offices

      Any Player who holds an Office by virtue of having won an
      Election for that Office is called the Electee to that
      Office.

      When an Electee to an Office is retired from that Office,
      e ceases to be the Electee for that Office. When an Electee
      to an Office is removed from that Office, e ceases to be
      Electee to that Office, and if e currently holds the Office,
      the Speaker shall become the holder of that Office, unless
      another Rule specifies a different Player who is to become
      the temporary of that Office.

      When a non-Electee Player is removed from an Office, that
      Office shall become held normally by the Electee of that
      Office, if there is an Electee. Otherwise, the Office shall
      be held temporarily by the Speaker.

      If a Player goes On Hold, deregisters, or is deregistered,
      e shall be removed from all Offices e holds.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1556/1 (Power=1)
Terms of Service for Offices

      Unless otherwise specified, the Term of Service for an Office
      shall expire on the first day of the fourth month following the
      month in which the Officer in question was elected to that
      Office.  At the exhaustion of an Office's Term of Service, the
      Officer holding that Office shall be retired from that Office.

      This Rule defers to Rules which specify a different Term of
      Service for specific Offices.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1758/2 (Power=1)
Holding an Office in Perpetuity

      If a Player is the Electee to an Office which e currently holds,
      then the Registrar may declare Without Objection that that
      Player holds the Office in perpetuity.

      The Term of Service of an Office held in perpetuity shall never
      expire, and a Player holding an Office in perpetuity continues
      to hold the Office in perpetuity while e holds the Office. If a
      Player holding an Office in perpetuity delegates the Office to
      another Player, then, if e resumes holding the Office in the
      normal fashion at the end of the Period of Delegation, e also
      resumes holding the Office in perpetuity.

      This Rule takes precedence over other rules defining the expiry
      of an Office's Term of Service.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 880/5 (Power=1)
Resignation of Offices

      A Player may, at any time, resign from any Office which e
      currently holds.

      An Electee to an Office who resigns from that Office may
      appoint a successor at the time e resigns. In this case,
      the resigning Player is retired from that Office; if the
      named successor agrees in the Public Forum to be successor
      to the Office, the named successor becomes holder of the
      Office.

      A non-Electee who resigns an Office, or an Electee who
      does not name a successor, is immediately removed from
      Office.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1645/4 (Power=1)
Temporary Delegation of Office

      An Electee to an Office who currently holds that Office is
      permitted to appoint another Player to perform the duties of
      that Office, for a Period not exceeding two weeks. This is
      called Delegation; the Player doing the appointing is herein
      referred to as the Delegating Player and the Player so appointed
      is herein referred to as the Delegated Player.

      An Office is legally Delegated if and only if the following
      conditions are met:

      (i)   the Delegating Player has posted to the Public Forum a
            Notice of Delegation, naming the Office being Delegated
            and the Delegated Player;

      (ii)  the Delegated Player is permitted by the Rules to hold
            the Office at the commencement of the Period of
            Delegation;

      (iii) the Delegated Player has posted, within the week
            immediately preceding or immediately following the
            posting of the Notice of Delegation, and to the Public
            Forum, a Notice of Consent to Delegation for that Office;

      (iv)  the Delegating Player is still the Electee to the
            Office, and still holds the office at the commencement
            of the Period of Delegation;

      (v)   the Period of Delegation has commenced and not yet
            concluded.

      The Period of Delegation commences at the time the Notice of
      Delegation is posted, or at the time the Notice of Consent to
      Delegation is posted, or at the time (if any) specified by the
      Delegating Player, whichever is latest. The Period of Delegation
      concludes two weeks after the Period of Delegation commences, or
      at the end of the Term of Service for the Delegated Office, or
      at the time (if any) specified by the Delegating Player,
      whichever is earliest.

      During the Period of Delegation, the Delegating Player ceases
      to hold the Delegated Office; the Delegated Player holds the
      Office temporarily, and earns the Salary for that Office as
      described in other Rules. At the end of the Period of
      Delegation, the Delegated Player ceases to hold the Delegated
      Office, and the Delegating Player resumes holding the Office,
      if e is permitted to do so. If not, the Speaker holds the
      Office.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 790/7 (Power=1)
Filling Vacant Offices

      Whenever there is an Office with no current Electee, for
      which an Election is not currently being conducted, the
      Registrar shall initiate an Election for that Office,
      as described elsewhere, unless the Office is that of
      Registrar; in that case, the Speaker shall conduct the
      Election.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1486/4 (Power=1)
Procedure to Impeach an Officer

      Any Active Player is permitted to call a Referendum to
      Impeach an Officer at any time, by requesting such in
      the Public Forum. The Officer is Impeached when such a
      Referendum is passed.

      The Referendum must list both the Office and the current
      Electee to that Office by name. If upon passage of the
      Referendum the named Player is the current Electee of
      that Office, then the Player is immediately removed
      from Office.

      For this Referendum the default procedure for referenda is
      modified as follows: Vote Collector is the Player who called for
      the Impeachment Referendum. Voting Entities do not include the
      Officer under consideration for Impeachment. Adoption Ratio must
      be greater than or equal to 2 for the Referendum to pass.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1644/2 (Power=1)
Dereliction of Duty

      A Player who:

      (i)   is the Electee to an Office which e currently holds, and
            whose duties include the weekly production of an Official
            Report, and
      (ii)  fails in 3 consecutive weeks to produce the weekly Report
            for that Office

      commits the Infraction of Dereliction of Duty. The penalty for
      the commission of this Infraction is the same as that for a
      Class B Crime, in addition to which the Player is removed from
      the Office in the performance of whose duties e has been
      Derelict.

      The Registrar is the Officer authorized to detect and report
      the commission of Infractions of Dereliction of Duty by Officers
      other than the Registrar. The Clerk of the Courts is the Officer
      authorized to detect and report the commission of the Infraction
      of Dereliction of Duty by the Registrar.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1665/1 (Power=1)
Abuse of Responsibility

      The Rules can give certain Officers latitude to make certain
      decisions and determinations based upon their judgement.  When
      these decisions and determinations have effect on the Game
      State, Players shall always have the ability to make Claims of
      Error alleging that these decisions and determinations were made
      outside the authority given to the Officer.  This Rule takes
      precedence over any Rule which otherwise defines a final arbiter
      for such decisions and determinations.

      If such a Claim is denied by the Officer, the Player making the
      Claim is then permitted to make a Call for Judgement alleging
      that the Officer is guilty of Abuse of Responsibility, a Class C
      Crime.  This is the only time such a CFJ is permitted.

      In Judging such a CFJ, to find the Officer guilty the Judge must
      establish that the Officer did one of the following:

        i) Went beyond all reasonable interpretations of the Rules.
       ii) That e disregarded explicit instructions the Rules gave in
           regard to eir decisions and determinations.
      iii) That e showed a pathological lack of judgement in such
           decisions and determinations.

      The accused Officer must be given the opportunity to explain eir
      actions.  And such Judgements shall be made in accord to the
      strictest possible standard of proof.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1585/1 (Power=2)
Official Duties upon Officer Change

      Whenever the holder of an Office changes, any duties which the
      Rules had imposed upon the prior holder of that Office as a
      consequence of holding that Office which have not been fulfilled
      must instead be fulfilled by the new holder of that Office, as
      soon as possible after the change of Officer occurs and in the
      same order in which the prior holder of that Office had been
      required to fulfill them.

      The former holder of the Office is absolved of performing all
      such duties, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

CFJ 1061 (Judged TRUE, Nov. 2 1997): "Rule 1585 should be interpreted
 such that a Player who is newly installed into an Office does not
 commit the Infraction of Failure to Report (insofar as that Office is
 subject to such duties) if e posts the required Report within a week
 of eir being installed into Office."

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1553/1 (Power=1)
Officer Transition

      Whenever a Player ceases to hold an Office, that Player shall
      make a reasonable effort to ensure that all materials necessary
      for the conduct of that Office, including any records the holder
      of that Office is required to maintain, are made available to
      the next Player to hold that Office.  A Player who fails to do
      so violates this Rule, and commits the Crime of Improper Officer
      Transition, a Class C Crime.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1728/3 (Power=1)
Actions Without N Objections

      Certain changes to Nomic Properties may be made Without N
      Objections, where N is an integer between one and five
      inclusive, specifying how many objections are necessary to
      prevent the change from taking place. Only those changes
      explicitly allowed by other Rules may be so made, and in order
      for such a change to take effect, the Rule allowing the change
      must explicitly state which Player or Players are authorized to
      make the change. If such a Rule does not specify a value for N
      between one and five, the value of N is one.

      In order to make a change Without N Objections, a Player
      authorized to make a given change Without N Objections must
      first post to the Public Forum eir intent to make such a change,
      unambiguously describing the change to be made. The change then
      takes place when a Player authorized to make that change Without
      N Objections (who need not be the same player who posted eir
      intent to make the change) posts to the Public Forum that that
      change is made, and the following conditions are fulfilled:

      (a) the post announcing the change is made no fewer than four
          days after, nor more than fourteen days after, the post
          announcing the intent to make the change;

      (b) between the two posts, fewer than N Players posted to the
          Public Forum objecting to the change.

      This Rule defers to Rules which place further restrictions
      on the effectiveness of changes made Without Objection.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1874/0 (Power=1)
Actions With N Supporters

      Certain changes to Nomic Properties may be made With N
      Supporters, where N is an integer between one and five
      inclusive, specifying how many supporters are necessary to
      allow the change to take place. Only those changes explicitly
      allowed by other Rules may be so made, and in order for such
      a change to take effect, the Rule allowing the change must
      explicitly state which Player or Players are authorized to
      make the change. If such a Rule does not specify a value for N
      between one and five, the value of N is one. For brevity's
      sake, the term "With Support" shall be taken as meaning
      "With one Supporter".

      In order to make a change With N Supporters, a Player
      authorized to make a given change With N Supporters must
      first post to the Public Forum eir intent to make such a change,
      unambiguously describing the change to be made. The change then
      takes place when a Player authorized to make that change With
      N Supporters (who need not be the same player who posted eir
      intent to make the change) posts to the Public Forum that that
      change is made, and the following conditions are fulfilled:

      (a) the post announcing the change is made no fewer than four
          days after, nor more than fourteen days after, the post
          announcing the intent to make the change;

      (b) between the two posts, N or more Players posted to the
          Public Forum supporting the change.

      This Rule defers to Rules which place further restrictions
      on the effectiveness of changes made With Supporters.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1664/7 (Power=1)
Rebellion

      Any Player is either Abiding or Rebellious. A new Player is
      always Abiding when e becomes a player. A Player can switch from
      Abiding to Rebellious or from Rebellious to Abiding by sending
      a message to the Public Forum saying e does change so. The
      Registrar shall maintain a list of all Players that are
      Rebellious. This list is known as the Red Pages, and is part of
      the Registrar's Report.

      A Player may Call for a Revolt at any time, by sending to the
      Public Forum saying e does so. A Call for Revolt is only
      effective if the following conditions are met:

         i) The player posting the Call is Rebellious,
        ii) No other effective Call for Revolt has been made that
            week,
       iii) A successful Revolt has not occured for a month or more.

      As soon as possible after an effective Call for Revolt has been
      posted, the Registrar must determine whether the Revolt
      succeeds, as outlined below, and post the result to the Public
      Forum.

      The result of a Revolt is determined as follows: The Registrar
      selects a random integer from 1 to the number of Players at the
      time of the Call for Revolt. If this number is less than or
      equal to the number of Rebellious Players at the time of the
      Call for Revolt, then the Revolt succeeds, otherwise it fails.

      If a Revolt succeeds, then the following events occur (in
      order):

         - The Registrar shall vacate all Blots of each Rebellious
           Player.
         - The Registrar shall pay out 2 VTs to each Rebellious
           Player.
         - The Registrar is empowered and required to levy a tax of
           75% on indulgences. The holder of the Patent Title
           "Robespierre" is exempt from this tax, even if other rules
           don't allow tax exemptions.

         - A Speaker Transition occurs
         - All Players that hold one or more Offices in the normal
           fashion cease to hold those in a normal fashion and hold
           them temporarily instead.
         - All Rebellious Players become Abiding again

      If a Revolt does not succeed, then:

         - All Rebellious Players gain 2 Blots.
         - The Player who Called for Revolt gains 2 (additional) Blots

      The Registrar shall execute all Payment Orders required by this
      rule.

      The Registrar is authorised to vacate any payment orders this
      rule requires em to vacate.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1840/0 (Power=1)
Inciting to Riot

      Any Player who is Rebellious continually for a period in excess
      of one month shall be guilty of the Infraction of Inciting To
      Riot. This Infraction shall be reported by the Registrar, and
      upon the report of the Infraction the Player becomes Abiding.

      The penalty for this Infraction shall be one Blot, plus one
      additional Blot for each instance the player switched from
      Abiding to Rebellious since the last Rebellion.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1834/0 (Power=1)
Robespierre

      There shall exist a Patent Title of "Robespierre".
      When a Revolt succeeds, the Player who Called for the Revolt is
      awarded this Title, and any previous holder of the Title loses
      it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1643/1 (Power=1)
Statements of Policy

      A document is a Statement of Policy if and only if it meets
      the following requirements :
      * it is posted to the Public Forum
      * it claims, in these exact terms, to be a "Statement of Policy"
      * it specifies, by name, an Office which it pertains to
      * that Office is held by its author.

      A Statement of Policy, when issued, becomes an SLC, the
      Jurisdiction of which irrevocably consists of the Player holding
      the Office named therein. That Player shall also be its
      Maintainer.

      An Officer shall be permitted to change eir own Statement of
      Policy by issuing a new version to the Public Forum. Further,
      any Statement of Policy ceases to exist whenever the Office it
      pertains to ceases to be held by the Player it constrains.

      Any violation of a SOP constitutes a Crime of Breach of Policy,
      a Class 2 Crime.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1007/15 (Power=1)
Salaries of Officers

      At the beginning of each month, the Registrar shall pay out
      to each Player the designated Salary for each Office that
      Player has held for a total of at least 12 days in the
      preceding month.

      There is a Basic Officer Salary, equal to a number of Voting
      Tokens, the level of which is set by the Chancellor, as
      described in other Rules.  Salaries are permitted to be
      expressed in terms of the Basic Salary.  Unless otherwise
      specified, the Salary for an Office shall be equal to the Basic
      Salary.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1858/1 (Power=1)
Unemployment Benefits

      As soon as possible after the beginning of each month, the
      Registrar shall pay out to every Player who does not receive any
      Officer's Salary for the previous month an unemployment benefit
      of half the Basic Officer Salary.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1854/1 (Power=1)
The Chancellor Can Set the Basic Officer Salary

      The Chancellor can set the level of the Basic Officer Salary
      by announcing in the Public Forum that e is doing so, provided
      that e announces a value between 0 VTs and 8 VTs inclusive,
      that e makes the announcement before the 25th day of the month,
      and that the Basic Officer Salary has not already been set by a
      similar such announcement earlier in the month.

----------------------------------------------------------------------



======================================================================
Making Proposals
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1483/4 (Power=1)
Definition of Proposals

      A Proposal is created whenever a Proposing Entity delivers some
      collection of text to the Public Forum with the clear indication
      that that text is intended to become a Proposal.  The collection
      of text thus delivered is a new Proposal, and the Proposing
      Entity which delivered it its Proposer. A collection of text is
      said to be Proposed when it becomes a Proposal.

      The delivery of the text of an existing Proposal which was
      Proposed less than three weeks previously does not cause that
      text to become another Proposal, unless there is a clear
      indication that that text is intended to become a duplicate of a
      prior Proposal.  In this case, the Proposing Entity must
      specifically acknowledge that the intended new Proposal is a
      duplicate of an existing Proposal.

      Further, the Promotor's distribution of previously undistributed
      Proposals never causes the Proposing of new Proposals.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1698/0 (Power=3)
The Proposal System Is Protected

      It must always be possible to adopt Proposals within a 4 week
      period. Any change to the game state which would result in
      this condition becoming false is cancelled and does not take
      place, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 105/1 (Power=3)
What Is a Rule Change?

      A Rule Change is any of the following:

      * The enactment of a new Rule;
      * The repeal of an existing Rule;
      * The amendment of the text of an existing Rule; or
      * Any change to a substantive property of a Rule other than
        its text.

      A "substantive property of a Rule" is any property of that
      Rule (other than its text) which determines in part or in full
      the ability of that Rule to govern by itself or in conjunction
      with other Rules.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 115/0 (Power=3)
Self-Referential Rules Allowed

      Rule Changes that affect Rules needed to allow or apply
      Rule Changes are as permissible as other Rule Changes.  Even
      Rule Changes that amend or repeal their own authority are
      permissible.  No Rule Change or type of move is impermissible
      solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a
      Rule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 107/0 (Power=3)
Rule Changes Must Be Written Down

      Any proposed Rule Change must be written down (or otherwise
      communicated in print media) before it is voted on. If adopted,
      it must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1339/6 (Power=3)
Precision in Rule Changes

      Exact precision is required in the specification of Rule
      Changes; any ambiguity or irregularity in the specification of a
      Rule Change causes it to be void and without effect.

      Variations in whitespace or capitalization in the quotation of
      text in an existing Rule to be removed or replaced does not
      create an irregularity or ambiguity, for the purpose of this
      Rule.  Any other variation, however, does.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 594/3 (Power=1)
Proposals and Rule Changes

      When a Proposal is adopted, its Power becomes equal to its
      Adoption Index, and the provisions contained in the text of the
      Proposal are implemented to the maximal extent permitted by the
      Rules.  Provisions which are unclear, ambiguous, or inapplicable
      are ignored.  In a Proposal containing more than one provision,
      each provision is severable from the others, unless the Proposal
      states otherwise.

      For the purpose of the Rules, the application of an adopted
      Proposal is a legal procedure for changing Nomic Properties.

      The Adoption Index of a Proposal is the maximum of 1, the value
      requested by its Proposer (if any), and the value required for
      that Proposal by the Rules (if any).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 404/2 (Power=2)
Legality of Proposals

      No Rule shall have any effect which seeks to make the legality
      of making a Proposal conditional upon its content.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1623/9 (Power=1)
Disinterested Proposals

      A Proposal is Disinterested if the text of the message wherein
      it is submitted explicitly states that it is a Disinterested
      Proposal. If a Proposal is not Disinterested, it is Interested.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1723/1 (Power=1)
Sanity

      A Proposal is Sane if all the following conditions are met:

         i) the text of the message wherein it is submitted
            explicitly states that it is a Sane Proposal,

        ii) The Proposal is Interested,

       iii) The Proposer has paid 2 P-Notes to the Bank, expressly
            for this purpose (and not for any other). In order for
            this payment to have effect, it must be made before
            the Proposal is distributed.

      Players may cast no more than one vote on a Sane Proposal.
      Non-Player Voting Entities may not vote on Sane Proposals.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would allow
      non-Player Voting Entities to vote on Sane Proposals, or which
      would allow Players to cast more than one vote on a Sane
      Proposal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1724/1 (Power=1)
Urgent Proposals

      A Proposal is Urgent if all the following conditions are met:

         i) the text of the message wherein it is submitted
            explicitly states that it is an Urgent Proposal,

        ii) The Proposal is Interested,

       iii) The Proposer has paid 1 P-Note to the Bank, expressly
            for this purpose (and not for any other). In order for
            this payment to have effect, it must be made before
            the Proposal is distributed.

      The Voting Period of an Urgent Proposal is five days.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would specify
      the Voting Period for Urgent Proposals.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1605/2 (Power=1)
Proposing Entities

      Let there exist a type of entity called a Proposing Entity.
      Only Proposing Entities have the right to make Proposals.

      Each Player is a Proposing Entity.  Other entities are Proposing
      Entities only if defined as such by the Rules.

      Any other Rule notwithstanding, in order to make a Proposal, a
      Proposing Entity must have an Executor.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1607/4 (Power=1)
The Promotor

      There shall exist the Office of the Promotor.  The Promotor
      shall receive a salary equal to 1.5 times the Basic
      Officer Salary.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1036/8 (Power=1)
The Proposal Queue

      As soon as possible after the Promotor receives a new Proposal,
      e shall place this Proposal in the Proposal Queue.

      The Proposal Queue is a list of Proposals, sorted in order of
      descending Priority. Proposals of the same priority are listed
      in the order they were proposed.

      A Proposal's Priority is an integer value. All Proposals
      initially have a Priority of zero.

      The Promotor shall publish the Proposal Queue weekly. This
      publication shall include the number, title, priority, and time
      of proposal, for each proposal in the Queue. If a Proposal's
      Priority has changed since the Queue was last published, then
      this change shall also be published. The actual text of the
      Proposals in the Queue need not be published.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 109/3 (Power=2)
Proposal Numbers

      At the time e distributes it, the Promotor shall give each
      Proposal a Number for reference.  The Number of a Proposal shall
      be the least integer greater than all other Numbers previously
      assigned to a Proposal (including numbers assigned to Proposals
      later determined to have been incorrectly submitted), or 301,
      whichever is greater.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1839/0 (Power=1)
The Promotor Can Change the Batch Size

      The Batch Size is an integer with a value between two and six
      inclusive, indicating the number of Proposals which will be
      distributed by the Promotor in the following Nomic Week,
      provided that there are that many Proposals in the Queue.
      Unless the Rules give it another value, the Batch Size is five.

      The Promotor may change the value of the Batch Size by
      announcing the new value in the Public Forum, provided that
      e announces a value between two and six inclusive, that e makes
      the announcement prior to midnight GMT Thursday, and that e has
      not already made such an announcement earlier in the Week. As
      indicated above, this change in the Batch Size has the effect
      of changing the number of Proposals which will be distributed
      by the Promotor in the Nomic Week *following* that in which the
      change is made; once the Week has begun, the Promotor cannot
      change the number of Proposals which will be distributed in
      that Week by changing the Batch Size.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1770/2 (Power=1)
Distributing Proposals

      Each week, the Promotor shall distribute a batch of Proposals.
      These are the only Proposals e is allowed to distribute that
      week.

      If the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue with a
      Priority greater than zero is less than or equal to the Batch
      Size, then the batch shall consist of all such Proposals.

      If the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue is greater
      than the Batch Size, then the batch shall consist of those
      Proposals in the Queue with the highest Priority such that the
      number of Proposals distributed is equal to the Batch Size.

      Once a Proposal is distributed, it is removed from the Proposal
      Queue.

      The Promotor shall distribute each proposal in the batch to the
      Public Forum, accompanied by its Number and the identity of
      its Proposing Entity.

      The failure of the Promotor to distribute any of the above
      accompaniments with a Proposal does not deprive the
      distribution of the Proposal of any legal effect.

      A Proposal is only considered to be legally distributed if it
      is explicitly marked as such. The Promotor is permitted to
      publish the text of undistributed Proposals without necessarily
      distributing them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1771/3 (Power=1)
Changing Priority

      An Player may increase or decrease the Priority of a Proposal
      in the Queue by announcing to the Public Forum that e does so,
      and paying a number of P-Notes to the Bank. For each P-Note e
      pays to the Bank, the Priority of the Proposal is increased or
      decreased by one as specified by the Player making the payment,
      provided that this transfer is not executed for any other
      purpose.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1772/0 (Power=1)
Promotor's Privilege

      At most once a week, the Promotor may increase the Priority of
      a single Proposal in the Proposal Queue by one, so long as
      e is not the Proposer of the Proposal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1773/1 (Power=1)
Monthly Priority Decrease

      Every month, as soon as possible after the beginning of the
      month, the Promotor shall decrement by one the priority of all
      Proposals in the Proposal Queue which were proposed over a
      month previously.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1774/1 (Power=1)
Discarding Proposals from the Queue

      If, at any time, there is a Proposal in the Proposal Queue
      which has zero or negative Priority and has been in the Queue
      for more than a month, then the Promotor may, at eir discretion,
      remove this Proposal from the Queue, and discard it.

      Also, the Proposer of a Proposal in the Queue may remove that
      Proposal from the Queue, by notifying the Promotor that e
      does so.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1349/0 (Power=2)
Rule Numbering

      The Rulekeepor shall give each newly-enacted Rule a Number for
      reference when it is created.  The Number of a Rule shall be the
      least integer greater than all other Numbers previously given to
      a Rule (including numbers assigned to Rules later determined to
      have been incorrectly enacted), or 301, whichever is greater.

      Once a Rule has been given a Rule Number, it shall not be
      changed except as specified in the Rules.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1003/2 (Power=2)
No Coercive Proposals

      Proposals whose obvious and direct intent is to coerce a Player
      into voting against eir conscience shall not take effect even if
      adopted, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

Voting on Proposals
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1449/8 (Power=1)
The Assessor

      There shall exist the Office of Assessor.  The Assessor
      shall receive a salary equal to 0.5 times the Basic
      Officer Salary.

      The Assessor shall also receive a Commission. At the end
      of the Voting Period for a Proposal, the Assessor shall
      pay out to emself an amount equal to 5% of the VTs spent
      on voting on that Proposal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 106/1 (Power=3)
Adopting Proposals

      All Proposals made and distributed in the proper way shall
      be voted upon.  A Proposal shall be adopted if and only if
      it receives the required number of votes and if Quorum is
      achieved.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 693/4 (Power=1)
Prescribed Voting Period

      The prescribed Voting Period for a Proposal is seven days,
      beginning at the time the Proposal is distributed to all
      Players.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1726/0 (Power=1)
The Guillotine

      There is a type of Application known as a Guillotine
      Application.  Such an Application is Executed by submitting it
      to the Assessor.  A Guillotine Application may specify when it
      is to take effect; if it does not do so, or specifies a time
      prior to its Execution, it takes effect when Executed.  For a
      Guillotine Application to take effect:

      * it must state that it is a Guillotine Application;

      * it must clearly identify exactly one Proposal to which it
        applies;

      * that Proposal's Voting Period must be in progress;

      * the ratio of the number of Active Senators whose signatures it
        bears to the number of Active Senators whose signatures it
        does not bear must exceed the Adoption Index of the Proposal;
        and

      * it must bear the signatures of at least two Senators.

      When a Guillotine Application takes effect, the Voting Period
      of the Proposal to which it applies immediately ends.  This Rule
      takes precedence over all other Rules governing the Voting
      Period of Proposals.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 206/10 (Power=2)
Voting Entities and Votes

      A Voting Entity is an Entity which is generally authorized by
      the Rules to cast a vote or votes on a Proposal, although other
      Rules may withdraw this authorization from a Voting Entity in
      specific circumstances without that Entity thereby ceasing to
      be a Voting Entity. No Entity is permitted to vote on a
      Proposal unless it is a Voting Entity, and only those Entities
      designated by the Rules to be Voting Entities are Voting
      Entities. Players and Groups are Voting Entities.

      Each Voting Entity has two votes on a Proposal, unless another
      Rule says otherwise. However, no such Entity shall have more
      than five votes on any Proposal, regardless of what any other
      Rule may say to the contrary.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1824/0 (Power=1)
Debt Voting

      An entity for which, at the beginning of a given Nomic week,
      there is at least one Overdue Payment Order naming it as Payor
      which was executed originally for the purpose of paying for
      Voting upon Proposals commits the Infraction of Debt Voting.
      This Infraction shall be reported by the Recordkeepor for Voting
      Tokens, and shall bear the penalty of the denial of Voting
      Privileges for a period of two weeks.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1825/0 (Power=1)
Denying Voting Privileges

      A penalty denying Voting Privileges to an entity for a period of
      time shall be imposed by ordering the Assessor to deny Voting
      Privilege to the named Voting Entity for that period of time.
      The denial of Voting Privilege begins with the beginning of the
      first full Nomic Week after the Order takes effect, and
      continues for the period specified.

      While the Assessor is ordered to deny Voting Privilege to a
      Voting Entity, that Voting Entity shall be entitled to cast no
      Votes on any Proposal, any other Rule to the contrary
      notwithstanding.

      Any period of time during which an Order denying Voting
      Privilege is without effect does not count toward the period of
      denial.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1765/0 (Power=1)
Attributing Additional Votes

      For each vote beyond the first two an entity casts on a
      particular Proposal, that entity must provide to the Assessor
      the Rule Numbers of the Rules that permit the casting of that
      additional vote.  If these Rule Numbers are not provided to the
      Assessor before the end of the voting period for that Proposal,
      the Assessor has the option to not count more than two votes on
      that Proposal from that entity.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 683/6 (Power=1)
Voting on Proposals

      A Voting Entity votes upon a Proposal when, during the Voting
      Period of that Proposal, e informs the Assessor of the vote or
      votes e is casting upon that Proposal, provided that e is
      authorized to cast those votes on that Proposal. Once cast, a
      vote cannot be changed or cancelled by the Voting Entity which
      cast it, although it may be cancelled as other Rules require.

      A vote upon a Proposal must be one of FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN
      (or an obvious synonym of one of these).  Something which is not
      one of these is not a vote upon a Proposal.

      A vote cast by a Voting Entity which does not have an Executor
      is cast at a time and in a manner specified in other Rules.

      This Rule in no way authorizes any entity to cast votes upon
      Proposals.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1715/4 (Power=1)
Announcing One's Presence

      A Player may declare that e is PRESENT on a Proposal, Election
      or Referendum, by sending a message to that effect to the Vote
      Collector of this Proposal, Election or Referendum.

      Players who declare themselves PRESENT on a Proposal, Election
      or Referendum during the Voting Period of that Proposal,
      Election or Referendum are, solely for the purpose of
      determining Quorum, considered to have voted, but a Player who
      both declares emself PRESENT and also Votes on the Proposal,
      Election or Referendum is counted only once toward Quorum.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which determine
      Quorum or whether a Proposal, Election or Referendum has met
      Quorum.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1764/4 (Power=1)
Public Voting

      Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
      any votes, or the declaration of Presence, by Voting Entities
      on Proposals, Elections or Referenda, may only be achieved by
      sending a message to the Public Forum.

      However, this Rule shall have no effect on the voting for a
      Proposal if it would prevent all legal voting on that Proposal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1873/0 (Power=1)
A Duty to Vote

      An Active Player with effective control of more than three
      Voting Tokens at the time a batch of Proposals is distributed,
      who is not denied Voting Privileges at that time, who is Active
      at the end of the Voting Period of the Proposal in the batch
      whose Voting Period finishes latest, and who fails to cast a
      vote on any Proposal in the batch, commits the Infraction of
      Failure to Vote, to be detected and reported by the Assessor.
      The penalty for commission of this Infraction is one Blot and
      one Voting Token.

      Effective control of an asset (e.g., a unit of Currency) is the
      ability to dispose of that asset as one wishes. The Assessor is
      empowered to make determinations as to whether a Player has
      effective control over a particular asset at a particular time.
      Such determinations may be overturned by the Courts.

      Three months after this Rule is created, it repeals itself.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1729/0 (Power=1)
Insanity

      An Interested Proposal is Insane, if it contains no minuscule
         letter.
      (That is the opposite of CAPITAL, for those who know not
         better.)

      For such a Proposal, until the Voting Period has ended:
      there shall be no discussing Votes, or this Rule has been
         bended.
      Nor shall a Player Vote in public, only to Assessor.
      The Votes shall be unknown to others, even employer and
         professor.

      And should it occur (due to greed or sin)
      that no one Votes FOR it, the Proposer shall Win.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1717/1 (Power=1)
The Senate

      A Senator is any Player who has been registered continuously for
      the immediately preceding two months.

      At any time during a Proposal's Voting Period, the Speaker may
      make it a Senate Proposal, by stating so in the Public Forum.
      If that does not happen, the Proposal is not a Senate Proposal.

      Entities other than Senators cannot Vote on Senate Proposals.
      If an Entity other than a Senator has already voted on a
      Proposal by the time it becomes a Senate Proposal, eir votes
      on that Proposal are cancelled.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1660/0 (Power=1)
The Speaker's Vote

      Any Speaker who is not Tainted is permitted to, once in any
      given Nomic Week, choose one specific Proposal (that e is
      otherwise eligible to vote for) and cast one vote in addition to
      any others e is permitted to cast on that Proposal.

      This Rule does not increase the maximum allowable votes that can
      be cast by a Voting Entity.

----------------------------------------------------------------------



======================================================================
The End of the Voting Period
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 879/7 (Power=1)
Quorum

      Quorum for a Proposal is achieved if a vote is cast on that
      Proposal by one-third of Active Players not denied voting
      privileges, or one-fifth of all Players, whichever is greater.

      Quorum for a Proposal is calculated at the beginning of the
      prescribed Voting Period for that Proposal, using information
      current at that time.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1761/0 (Power=1)
Quorum Without Objection

      The Speaker has the power to, Without Objection, designate any
      Proposal whose voting period is underway to have achieved
      Quorum.  That Proposal shall then have its Quorum adjusted to
      equal zero.

      This Rule takes precedence over the Rules defining Quorum for
      Proposals.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 208/2 (Power=1)
End of the Voting Period

      As soon as possible after the end of the Voting Period on a
      given Proposal, the Assessor shall publish all the Votes cast
      upon that Proposal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 955/5 (Power=3)
Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal

      When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the
      uncancelled votes which have been legally cast shall be counted
      by the Assessor. The Proposal shall then be assigned a Voting
      Index, as follows: if the Proposal received no votes opposed,
      and at least one vote in favor, the Voting Index shall be
      Unanimity; if there are no votes in favor, the Voting Index
      shall be zero; in all other cases, the Voting Index shall be
      the number of votes in favor divided by the number of votes
      opposed.

      If the Voting Index is greater than the Adoption Index for the
      Proposal, or if both equal Unanimity, and there were at
      least three votes in favor of the Proposal, then that Proposal
      is adopted.  Otherwise, it fails.

      A Proposal may not have its Voting Index set except
      as described in this Rule.  A Proposal may not be adopted
      (synonymous with the Proposal passing) except as described
      in this Rule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1322/3 (Power=3)
Effectiveness of Rule Changes

      A given Rule Change shall not take effect unless the Power of
      the instrument which specified it is at least as great as the
      greater of the current Power of the Rule to be Changed (if any)
      and the Power the Rule would have after the Change (if any).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 108/1 (Power=3)
When May Rule Changes Take Effect?

      A given form of a Rule may not have effects earlier than
      the moment it came to have that form. The form of a Rule
      consists of its text and other substantive properties.

      No Rule Change may have retroactive application.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 376/3 (Power=1)
When Proposals Take Effect

      A Proposal which is Adopted takes effect at the time date-
      stamped on the first message sent by the Assessor to reach
      the Public Forum announcing the results of the voting on that
      Proposal.

      If the message sent by the Assessor announcing the results of
      the voting on a Proposal also contains the results of voting
      upon other Proposals, all such Proposals shall take effect at
      the same time, but in order by increasing Proposal Number.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1690/0 (Power=1)
Power of New Rules

      The Power of a new Rule shall be as specified by the instrument
      which causes the creation of that Rule; if no such specification
      exists, the Power of the new Rule shall be 1.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1561/1 (Power=2)
Illegality of Bonus Clauses

      Any Proposal which offers a bribe to a Player or Players to
      vote either FOR or AGAINST a Proposal (either itself or another
      Proposal) shall be completely without effect, even if it is
      adopted, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1069/1 (Power=1)
Amendment Numbers

      A Rule's Amendment Number is equal to the number of times a
      Rule having that Rule Number has been amended. The default
      Amendment Number is zero; this is the value of a Rule's
      Amendment Number when the Rule is Created, and it is the value
      of the Amendment Number of every Rule unless it is specified by
      the Rules to be otherwise.

      A Rule's Amendment Number shall be displayed in Official copies
      of the Ruleset, appended to the Rule Number, and separated by a
      forward slash.  Responsibility is given to the Rulekeepor to
      accurately update Amendment Numbers.

      Amendment Numbers may be used for Official purposes and in
      Official documents to distinguish between old versions of a
      Rule and the Rule's current text.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 833/12 (Power=1)
Reward for Getting a Proposal Passed

      As soon as possible after the beginning of the Nomic Week,
      the Assessor shall pay out two Proposal Notes to each Player
      who submitted an Interested Proposal which was adopted during
      the previous Week.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 947/12 (Power=1)
Bonus for Repeal

      If a Proposal is adopted which, as part or all of its effect,
      repeals one or more Rules, and immediately prior to the
      adoption of this Proposal there were more than 100 Rules, the
      Rulekeepor shall pay out 1 P-Note to the Proposer of that
      Proposal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1786/0 (Power=1)
Proposal Passed by the Narrowest of Margins

      A Proposal is considered to have passed by the narrowest of
      margins when all of the following conditions are true:

      1) The Proposal has met the requirements established by other
         Rules to be considered passed.
      2) If there had been 1 (one) less FOR vote (out of the total
         number of FOR votes in the final tally) on this proposal,
         it would not have passed or not met Quorum -- or both.
      3) There must have been at least 1 (one) AGAINST vote in the
         final tally.

      As soon as possible after a Proposal has been determined to
      have passed by the narrowest of margins, the Assessor shall pay
      out to that Proposal's Proposer an award of 3 (three) Voting
      Tokens in addition to any other award that Player might also
      receive for the passing of that Proposal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1678/3 (Power=1)
Encourage Proposals by New Players

      If an Interested Proposal passes, and that Proposal was
      submitted by a Player within that Player's Grace Period, then
      the Assessor shall pay out to that Player an award of 3 Voting
      Tokens, over and above any other award that Player might also
      receive for that Proposal.  This Rule takes precedence over
      Rules that would prevent this award.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1583/2 (Power=1)
Proposal Penalties Halved for New Players

      All penalties that are a direct result of voting on Proposals
      are halved if the penalties are being applied to a Player during
      that Player's Grace Period.

      This Rule takes precedence over all other Rules pertaining to
      penalties that are a direct result of voting.

======================================================================
Referenda and Elections
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1434/4 (Power=1)
Default Procedure for Referendum Voting

      When a Referendum Vote is required and the procedure is not
      defined elsewhere, the following Standard Referendum Voting
      Procedure shall be used. Details specified herein are defaults
      which may be modified by other Rules for specific situations.

      This procedure shall under no circumstances be used for Voting
      on Proposals, unless specifically required by the Rules
      governing specific types of Proposals.

      * Vote Collector: The Vote Collector is the Entity responsible
      for collecting and tallying the Votes and announcing the result.
      This Entity is the Speaker if not otherwise specified.

      * Voting Entities: Every Player not on Hold may Vote on a
      Referendum.  On Hold status is measured at the time a Player
      sends eir Vote.

      * Voting: A Voting Entity Votes by sending eir Vote to the Vote
      Collector during the Voting Period, indicating what Referendum e
      is Voting on, and what eir Vote is.

      * Vote Values: A Vote is FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN. Words which
      are effectively synonymous with these are also permissible.

      * Vote Strength: Every Vote has equal strength. No Voting Entity
      may Vote more than once on any single Referendum.

      * Retraction: A Vote, once sent to the Vote Collector, cannot be
      changed.

      * Start of Voting: The Voting Period begins at the time the
      first correct and legal announcement that a Referendum is
      begun, as defined in other Rules, is sent to the Public
      Forum, together with the identity of the Vote Collector.

      * Duration of Voting: The Voting Period lasts for one Week. All
      Votes received by the Vote Collector outside of the Voting
      Period have no effect.

      * Secrecy During Voting: Unless otherwise specified, the Vote
      Collector may not give away any information about the Votes
      while the Voting is underway.

      This shall in no way prohibit the Vote Collector from posting,
      at any time and to the Public Forum, a list of those Players who
      have already Voted.

      * Secrecy After Voting: Unless otherwise specified, the Vote
      Collector shall post to the Public Forum, after the Voting
      Period is over, the number of Votes of each kind as well as the
      name and Vote of each Entity which cast a Vote.

      * Adoption Ratio: The Adoption Ratio, the ratio of FOR Votes on
      a Referendum relative to the AGAINST VOTES, must be greater than
      Adotion Index for the Referendum to pass. If it is not, the
      Referendum fails.

      * Adoption Index: Unless otherwise specified, the Adoption Index
      for a Referendum is 1.

      * Quorum: Quorum shall be set at 50% of the eligible Voting
      Entities at the beginning of the Voting Period. If a smaller
      fraction voted, the Referendum automatically fails.

      * Nonperformance by Vote Collector: The Vote Collector must
      perform eir required duties, but if the result of a Referendum
      is not announced within one Week following the end of the Voting
      Period, it automatically fails.

      * Effectiveness: the full effects of a Referendum, as defined
      in Rules which make use of the Referendum procedure, come
      into force as of the moment the results are announced to the
      Public Forum.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1445/9 (Power=1)
Defaults for Elections

      When an Election is required and the procedure is not defined
      elsewhere, the following Standard Election Procedure shall be
      used. Details specified herein are defaults which may be
      modified by other Rules for specific situations.

      * Vote Collector: The Vote Collector is the Entity responsible
      for taking nominations, collecting and tallying the Votes, and
      announcing the result. Unless otherwise specified, this Entity
      is the Player who is Speaker at the time the Referendum starts.
      If another Player is specified, this Player shall be the Vote
      Collector for the entire duration of the Referendum.

      If the Vote Collector deregisters or is deregistered before the
      Voting Period ends, the Election has no Winner.

      * Nominating Entities: Every Player not on Hold may Nominate
      eirself in an Election. On Hold status is measured at the time a
      Player makes a Nomination.

      * Nominations: A Nominating Entity makes a Nomination by sending
      a message to the Vote Collector during the Nominating Period,
      indicating what Election e is Nominating for.

      * Candidates: A Player who has Nominated for an Election is
      called a Candidate for that Election.

      * Retraction: A Nomination, once sent to the Vote Collector, may
      be retracted before the end of the Nominating Period. A player
      may retract a Nomination e has made by sending a message to the
      Vote Collector, indicating that e wishes to retract eir
      Nomination.

      * Start of Nominations: The Nominating Period begins at the
      time of the first correct and legal announcement that the
      Election has begun, as required by the Rules calling for the
      Election.

      * Duration of Nominations: The Nominating Period lasts for one
      Week.  All Nominations received by the Vote Collector outside of
      the Nominating Period have no effect.

      * Secrecy: Nominations need not be kept secret.

      * Announcing Candidates : the Vote Collector shall announce to
      the Public Forum, as soon as possible after the Nominating
      Period is over, the names of all Players who Nominated for the
      Election.

      If there are no Candidates in a given Election, then that
      Election shall have no Winner. If there is only one Candidate in
      a given Election, then that Candidate shall be the Winner of
      that Election.

      In all other cases, a Referendum shall being at the time
      Candidates are Announced, which shall be conducted using the
      standard procedure for Referendum Voting with the following
      exceptions :

      * Vote Collector: The Vote Collector for the Referendum is the
      same as the Vote Collector for the Election.

      * Vote Values: A Vote is the name of exactly one of the
      Candidates for the given Election. Words which are effectively
      synonymous with these are also permissible.

      * Adoption: The Winner of the Election is the Candidate for whom
      the most votes were cast. If there is more than one such
      candidate, the Speaker chooses one of those candidates as the
      winner, and must announce eir chosen candidate as winner to the
      Public Forum.

      * Quorum: Quorum shall be set at 50% of the eligible Voting
      Entities at the beginning of the Voting Period. If a smaller
      fraction voted, the Election has no Winner.

      * Nonperformance by Vote Collector: The Vote Collector must
      perform eir required duties, but if the result of an Election is
      not announced within one Week following the end of the Voting
      Period, the Election has no Winner.

      * Effective Time of Election Results: The results of an Election
      are effective at the time the results of the Referendum are
      announced; or, if there is no Referendum, at the time that the
      Vote Collector announces that there is to be no Referendum.

      * Cutoff for Challenges: Any challenge of the correctness of the
      announced results of an Election must be made within seven days
      of the time the results are announced.  If seven days pass from
      the time the results are announced without a challenge, the
      announced results are the true results of that Election, whether
      or not they be in error in any way.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1558/2 (Power=1)
Defaults for Elections for Offices

      When the Rules require that an Election be conducted to fill
      an Office, that Election shall be conducted in accordance with
      the usual Rules for Elections, with the following exceptions:

      * The Vote Collector of the Election shall be the Registrar,
        unless the Office which the Election is seeking to fill is
        that of the Registrar, in which case the Vote Collector shall
        be the Speaker; and

      * No Player may be Nominated who, at the time of attempted
        Nomination, would not be permitted to hold the Office which
        the Election is seeking to fill.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1835/0 (Power=1)
Standing Down

      During the Voting Period of an Election, any Candidate for that
      Election may stand down, by posting a message to the Public
      Forum to that effect. The player is then no longer to be
      considered a Candidate for that Election. Any further votes
      cast in eir favour are invalid, and e cannot win the Election.

      When a player stands down, e has the option of transferring all
      votes so far cast for em to another Candidate in the Election,
      if one exists. To do so, e must explicitly state which Candidate
      e is transferring eir votes to, in the same message as the
      announcement that e is standing down. Any votes transferred in
      this fashion will be considered to be cast for the receiving
      Candidate.

      This rule takes precedence over other rules for determining the
      Winner of an Election.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1659/3 (Power=1)
The Right to Call Elections

      Any Speaker who is not Tainted has the Right to call Elections.
      This is the Right to declare any number of Offices to be held
      temporarily.  This Right is exercised by posting an announcement
      in the Public Forum that both lists a number of Offices
      currently held by their Electees, and declares that the Speaker
      is exercising eir Right to call these Elections.  If the Speaker
      posts such a message, is not Tainted at the time of posting, and
      has not exercised this Right since e last became Speaker, the
      Electees of these Offices shall cease to be the Electees to
      those Offices.

----------------------------------------------------------------------



======================================================================
Applications
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1626/2 (Power=1)
Applications

      An Application is any body of text designated as such by a
      Player.  This Player is known as its Sponsor.

      A Player's Signature is added to an Application when e sends a
      message to that Application's Sponsor indicating that e wishes
      to sign it.

      A Player's Signature is stricken from the Application when e
      sends a message to the Sponsor of the Application stating that e
      wishes eir signature stricken.  Further, the Sponsor of an
      Application may strike any Signature from the Application at any
      time.

      If an Application is amended in any way (except to add or strike
      a Signature), any and all Signatures which appear on it are
      stricken from it.

      An Application is Executed when its Sponsor submits it to
      whatever Officer or other Player is designated by the Rules to
      receive Applications of that particular type, with whatever
      effect is defined by the Rules for the Execution of that type of
      Application.  However, any other Rule notwithstanding, the
      Execution of an Application shall have no effect unless Executed
      within 14 days of the time the oldest Signature which appears on
      it was added.

      If a Player Executing an Application claims that the Application
      contains certain Signatures, but the purported Signatures have
      not been added to it in a manner consistent with this Rule, e
      commits the Crime of Application Fraud, a Class D Crime.

----------------------------------------------------------------------



======================================================================
Orders
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1793/0 (Power=1)
Orders

      An Order is a command, executed by a Player and directed to some
      entity requiring that entity to perform exactly one action, or
      to refrain from performing one or more actions.

      An Order may be directed to the holder of an Office or other
      official position in eir capacity as that Office or other
      official position, and in this case if the Office or position
      changes hands before the Order is satisfied, the duty to abide
      by the Order automatically attaches to the new holder of that
      Office or position.

      Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Order, the purpose of which is
      to affect the operation of a prior Order, is as valid as any
      other Order, and is said to be directed at the prior Order it
      affects.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1798/1 (Power=1)
I Was Only Obeying Orders

      A Player who performs as required by an Order which is later
      found to be invalid shall not be convicted of a Crime, nor
      penalized by being billed, being removed from or retired
      from Office, becoming Tainted, or being deregistered,
      solely as a result of performing as required by the Order.
      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would cause
      the Player to be convicted of a Crime or penalized, as
      described, for said action.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1794/0 (Power=1)
Classes of Orders

      There are four classes of Order: Administrative, Judicial,
      Appellate, and Private.

      A Judicial Order is an Order executed by a Player while acting
      as a Judge.

      An Appellate Order is an Order executed by a Board of Appeals.

      An Administrative Order is an Order executed by the holder of an
      Office or other official position (such as the Speaker or the
      Recordkeepor of a Currency) other than that of a Judge or
      Justice, in the course of performing the duties of that Office
      or position.

      A Private Order is any other sort of Order.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1795/2 (Power=1)
Timing Requirements of Orders

      An Order which commands the performance of an action may specify
      when that action is to be performed; if no specification is
      given, or the specification given would require the
      performance of the action at a time when the Order is without
      effect, or if the specification given would allow less than
      72 hours from the time when the Order takes effect to perform
      the action, then the Order shall be taken to require the
      performance of the action as soon as possible after the Order
      takes effect.

      If an Order which commands the performance of an action is
      directed to an Office or other position of authority, and the
      holder of that position of authority changes after the Order
      takes effect, but before the Order is satisfied, and the
      specification would require the performance of the action at a
      time before the current holder of the position came to hold
      that position, or would allow less than 72 hours from the time
      the current holder of the position came to hold that position,
      then the Order shall be taken to require the performance of the
      action as soon as possible after the current holder of the
      position came to hold that position.  However, this shall
      not be taken to absolve the previous holder of the position
      of any penalties e might otherwise incur.

      This Rule defers to any Rule which establishes regulations
      relating to the performance of duties required by various sorts
      of Orders, and only establishes the time by which an Order must
      be performed.  The noncompliance of an Order with this Rule does
      not deprive that Order of all effect, but instead modifies the
      effect of that Order with respect to the time at which or by
      which the actions it requires must be performed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1796/0 (Power=1)
Validity of Orders

      All Orders executed in the manner prescribed by the Rules for
      their class and type are presumed valid and enforceable until
      proven otherwise by CFJ.

      In order to be proven valid by CFJ, the Rules must permit the
      Player who executed the Order in question to execute such an
      Order, that the execution of the Order must have been required
      by or permitted in the circumstances which existed at the time
      it was executed, and that the Order has not been rendered
      invalid by the operation of any other Rule.

      Furthermore, no Order may act to prevent or hinder its own
      appeal in any way, and any portion of an Order which has this
      effect is void and without force.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1797/0 (Power=1)
Abuse of Authority

      Knowingly and willfully executing invalid Orders constitutes the
      Class B Crime of Abuse of Authority.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1799/1 (Power=1)
Amendment, Stay, and Vacation of Orders

      Any Order, except a Transfer Order, may always be amended,
      stayed, or vacated by the Player (or, in the case of Appellate
      Orders, Board of Appeal) who executed it.  A Delayed Transfer
      Order may be amended, stayed or vacated by the Player who
      executed it only during the time in which it is delayed.
      Certain classes of Orders may be amended, stayed, or vacated in
      other circumstances as well, when the Rules so allow.  In all
      cases, this is done by an Order to Amend, Stay, or Vacate,
      respectively, the original Order.

      Otherwise, an Order shall not be amended, stayed, vacated, or
      otherwise changed once executed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1800/0 (Power=1)
Amendment of Orders

      The effect of amending an Order is to cause it to be effective
      in its amended form.  The prior form of the Order ceases to have
      effect upon the amendment, and the new form has effect as if it
      had been originally executed in that form at the moment the
      amendment becomes effective.

      Vacating an Order to Amend has the same effect as would an Order
      to Amend reinstating the previous form of the Order.

      Amending a stayed or vacated Order does not grant the stayed or
      vacated Order effect it would otherwise not have.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1801/0 (Power=1)
Stay of Orders

      The effect of staying an Order is to temporarily deny the stayed
      Order from having any effect.

      A stay may be ordered for a fixed time, in which case the stay
      expires at the time specified; or for an indefinite time, in
      which case the stay will not expire.  If no specification is
      made in the Order to Stay, the stay shall be indefinite.

      When the stay expires or is vacated, the previously stayed order
      again has effect as if it had been originally executed at the
      moment the stay ceases to be effective.  However, if at the time
      the staying Order expires or otherwise ceases to have effect,
      the stayed Order has been vacated or is subject to another
      staying Order, it does not regain effect.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1802/0 (Power=1)
Vacation of Orders

      The effect of vacating an Order is to permanently deny the
      vacated Order from having any effect.  Vacating an Order to
      Vacate reinstates the ability of the vacated Order to have
      effect, as of the moment the Order to Vacate is itself vacated.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1808/1 (Power=1)
Administrative and Private Orders

      Administrative Orders are executed by being published in the
      Public Forum, and take effect upon publication.

      Private Orders are executed by submitting them to the Player to
      be commanded, and take effect upon submission.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1809/0 (Power=1)
Appeal of Administrative and Private Orders

      Both Administrative and Private Orders are subject to appeal by
      a CFJ, the statement of which Statement alleges that the Order
      is improperly or invalidly executed.

      Upon a judicial finding that an Administrative or Private Order
      was improperly or invalidly executed, the Judge so finding shall
      vacate that Order.

      When the Clerk of the Courts receives a properly executed Call
      for Judgement, the statement of which alleges that an
      Administrative or Private Order was improperly or invalidly
      executed, the Clerk of the Courts shall stay the Order in
      dispute.  If the Judge affirms the validity of the original
      Order, e shall then vacate this stay.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1810/0 (Power=1)
Noncompliance with Orders

      An Order is satisfied when the action which it requires to be
      performed is performed by the entity it requires to perform it.
      (Only Orders which require an entity to perform an action can be
      satisfied.)  Any entity who is required by an Order to perform
      an act who fails to perform the required action prior to the
      time specified in the Order commits the Crime of Contempt by
      Inaction, a Class C Crime.

      Except when otherwise specified, a single action can result in
      the satisifaction of at most one Order.  If an action would
      satisfy more than one Order, and no other specification is made,
      the Action satisfies the oldest Order which it would satisfy.

      This Rule shall have no application with respect to any Order
      which has been adjudicated to be invalid, and the invalidity of
      the Order is a complete defense to a Criminal accusation made
      under this Rule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1811/0 (Power=1)
Contempt by Action

      Any entity who, while required by an Order to refrain from
      performing an action, performs the proscribed action while the
      Order is in effect commits the Crime of Contempt by Action, a
      Class C Crime.

      This Rule shall have no application with respect to any Order
      which has been adjudicated to be invalid, and the invalidity of
      the Order is a complete defense to a Criminal accusation made
      under this Rule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------



======================================================================
The Clerk of the Courts
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 889/6 (Power=1)
Clerk of the Courts

      There shall exist the Office of Clerk of the Courts.  The
      Clerk of the Courts shall receive a salary equal to
      2 times the Basic Officer Salary.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1450/2 (Power=1)
Speaker Cannot Stay CotC or Justiciar

      If at any time the Speaker shall be the Electee to either
      the Office of CotC or the Office of Justiciar, e shall be
      retired from whichever of those Offices e is Electee to.

----------------------------------------------------------------------



======================================================================
Calling for Judgement
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 991/3 (Power=2)
Invoking Judgement

      Any Player who seeks formal resolution of any dispute pertaining
      to this Nomic shall be permitted to request such by submitting a
      Call for Judgement to the Clerk of the Courts.  For the purpose
      of this and other Rules, the submission of a Call for Judgement
      shall constitute proof of the existence of a dispute.

      Any document submitted to the Clerk of the Courts and which is
      clearly marked as a Call for Judgement is a Call for Judgement.

      The Clerk shall distribute the text of a Call for Judgement,
      along with any additional material submitted by the Caller
      (including, but not limited to, Arguments and Evidence) not
      later than the time e announces the identity of the first Judge
      assigned to Judge it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1831/0 (Power=1)
Filing a CFJ with the Justiciar

      A CFJ alleging that the Clerk of the Courts has failed to
      perform a duty of eir Office may, at the Caller's option, be
      filed with the Justiciar, who shall then perform all the duties
      of the Clerk of the Courts with respect to that CFJ.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 897/1 (Power=1)
Barring Players from Judgement

      The Player who submits a Call for Judgement is permitted to
      specify up to three Players who are to be Barred from Judging
      that CFJ.  Any Players that are so Barred are ineligible to
      Judge that CFJ.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1562/3 (Power=1)
Excess CFJs

      The Clerk of the Courts shall dismiss without prejudice any CFJ
      made by a Player who has previously made five or more CFJs
      during that Nomic Week.  Such a CFJ is called an "excess CFJ".
      The Player who submits an excess CFJ commits the Infraction of
      Excess CFJing, to be reported by the Clerk of the Courts and
      bearing a penalty of 0.5 VT.

      If the Clerk of the Courts fails to dismiss an excess CFJ, and
      instead assigns it to a Judge, then the CFJ shall not be
      dismissed for being an excess CFJ and shall be Judged (or
      dismissed) exactly as any other CFJ.  Failing to dismiss an
      excess CFJ is the Infraction of Allowing Excess CFJing, to be
      reported by the Justiciar, and bearing a penalty of 0.5 VT and
      two Blots.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1563/1 (Power=1)
Statement of a CFJ

      In order to be Judged, a Call for Judgement must contain a
      single clearly-labeled Statement which must be able to be
      determined by the means of logical reasoning, with the
      presumption of perfect knowledge, to be either TRUE or FALSE.
      Statements which are inherently contradictory or which are
      vacuous are not acceptable, and a CFJ containing such a
      Statement shall not be Judged.

      If a CFJ fails to meet the requirements of this or of other
      rules it lacks standing and is to be dismissed.

      It is permitted for a Call for Judgement to contain Arguments,
      Evidence, or other material placed there at the Caller's
      discretion.  However, the Judge is not required to take notice
      of any part of the CFJ other than the Statement in formulating
      eir Judgement.

----------------------------------------------------------------------



======================================================================
Selecting a Judge
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1868/0 (Power=1)
Selecting a Judge

      Whenever there is an open Call for Judgement to which no Player
      has been assigned as its Judge, the Clerk of the Court shall, as
      soon as possible after being made aware of this condition,
      select a Player to be assigned as its Judge.  This selection
      shall be made from amongst all those Players eligible to serve
      as the Judge of that CFJ.

      Once assigned as the Judge of a CFJ, that Player remains the
      Judge of that CFJ until e is recused from that CFJ, or e ceases
      to be a Player.

      The Clerk shall announce the identity of the Player who is
      assigned to Judge a CFJ as soon as possible after the selection
      is made.

      A CFJ is "open" if it has neither been dismissed nor judged, or
      if there is an outstanding judicial motion pertaining to that
      CFJ which has been neither granted nor denied.  A CFJ which is
      not open is closed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 698/5 (Power=1)
Always an Eligible Judge

      Every Active Player is eligible to Judge a given CFJ unless
      specifically made ineligible by some Rule.

      The Caller of a given CFJ is never eligible to Judge that CFJ.

      If, after taking all other rules affecting eligibility into
      account, there are no Players eligible to Judge a CFJ, then
      all Active Players, excluding the Caller and those Players
      Barred by the Caller, shall be eligible, any other Rule to
      the contrary notwithstanding.

      If this still does not result in there being any Players
      eligible to Judge, then all Players (Active or not), excluding
      the Caller and those Players Barred by the Caller, shall be
      eligible.

      If this still does not result in there being any Players
      eligible to Judge, then all Players, excluding the Caller, shall
      be eligible.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule or combination of Rules
      which would result in there being no Players eligible to Judge a
      given CFJ.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1871/0 (Power=1)
Turns for All

      Whenever a Player is selected to judge a CFJ, e becomes
      ineligible to judge any future CFJs. If ever there are no
      Players eligible to Judge a CFJ, then all Players made
      ineligible by this rule become eligible again.

      Being made ineligible to judge a CFJ by this rule does not cause
      a Player to become ineligible to serve as a Justice on that CFJ.
      This rule takes precedence over any rule which claims otherwise.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1567/6 (Power=1)
Making Oneself Ineligible to Judge a CFJ

      A Player makes emself ineligible to be the Judge of a specific
      CFJ by transmitting a notice to the Clerk of the Courts,
      specifying the CFJ for which e wishes to be made ineligible.

      If, at the time a Player makes emself ineligible to be a Judge
      of a CFJ in this manner, e has already been selected as the
      Judge of that CFJ, the Clerk of the Courts shall bill that
      Player a fee of 0.5 VT and shall recuse that Player as the Judge
      of that CFJ.

CFJ 1101 (Judged TRUE, Jul. 27 1998; Sustained upon appeal, Aug. 14
 1998): "Rule 1567 should be interpreted such that a Player may only
 make emself ineligible to Judge a CFJ which has already been called."

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1568/4 (Power=1)
Judges On Hold

      Any Player who goes on Hold while selected as the Judge of one
      or more CFJs commits the Infraction of Judge Inactivity.  This
      Infraction is to be reported by the Clerk of the Courts, and has
      a penalty of 0.5 VT times the number of CFJs for which the
      Player was selected as Judge when e went On Hold.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1756/1 (Power=1)
Delinquent Judges

      The Clerk of the Courts shall recuse from a CFJ any Judge who is
      delinquent upon the demand of any two Players.  A Player demands
      the recusal of a delinquent Judge by posting eir demand in the
      Public Forum.

      A Judge recused for delinquency commits the Infraction of
      Judicial Delinquency, to be reported by the Clerk of the Courts
      and bearing a penalty of 2 Blots.

      The Player assigned to Judge a Call for Judgement is required to
      either return a Judgement upon that CFJ or dismiss that CFJ
      within the assigned deliberation period, which ends seven days
      after e is assigned to Judge it.

      Failure to do so is the Infraction of Judging Late, detected
      and reported by the CotC. At the time of the report of the
      Infraction, if the CFJ has been Judged or dismissed then the
      penalty is 1 VT and the Judgement or dismissal is legal even
      though delivered late.  Otherwise the penalty is 3 Blots, and
      the Judge becomes ineligible to Judge that CFJ, and a new Judge
      shall be assigned in the usual manner.

      A Judge who has neither judged nor dismissed a CFJ within seven
      days after the end of the assigned deliberation period becomes
      ineligible to Judge that CFJ, and any Judgement or Dismissal
      submitted after this time is not legal and shall not be accepted
      by the CotC.

      However, if the Player assigned to Judge a CFJ ceases to be
      eligible before judging or dismissing that CFJ, then e is
      neither required nor permitted to either return a Judgement on,
      or dismiss, that CFJ, and ceases to be the Judge assigned to
      that CFJ at the moment e becomes ineligible.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 591/12 (Power=1)
Legal Judgements

      A Judge judges a CFJ by sending eir Judgment to the Clerk of the
      Courts.  The Judgement of a CFJ must be either TRUE or FALSE.
      Only the Judge assigned to a CFJ may Judge that CFJ.

      As soon as possible after the receipt of a legal Judgement, the
      Clerk shall distribute the Judgement to the Public Forum.

      A Judge who delivers Judgement on a CFJ before the end of
      the assigned deliberation period shall receive a Judicial
      Salary of 1 VT.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 217/3 (Power=1)
Judgements Must Accord with the Rules

      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however,
      if the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the
      Statement to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider game
      custom, commonsense, past Judgements, and the best interests of
      the game before applying other standards.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1575/3 (Power=1)
Standards of Proof

      A CFJ alleging that a Player has violated a Rule or committed a
      Crime shall not be judged TRUE unless the evidence is sufficient
      to be certain of that Judgement beyond reasonable doubt.

      In all other CFJs, the Judgement shall be consistent with the
      preponderance of the evidence at hand.

      Furthermore, it is a defense to any accusation of a Crime that
      the Player reasonably believed that eir actions were not a
      Crime at the time e performed them, or that e reasonably did not
      know that e was required to perform an action, when such
      nonperformance is defined as a Crime.  No Player shall be
      convicted of a Crime if this defense applies.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1768/0 (Power=1)
Evidentiary Status of Officer Reports

      The published Report of an Officer constitutes prima facie
      evidence of the truth of those matters reported therein which
      that Officer is required by law to report.  This presumption may
      be set aside only by clear and convincing evidence to the
      contrary.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 451/3 (Power=1)
Determination of Judgement--Timing

      When a Judge is considering eir Judgement of a Statement
      contained in a CFJ, e shall make eir evaluation based on the
      truth or falsity of the Statement at the time the CFJ was
      issued.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1565/6 (Power=1)
Dismissal of a CFJ

      A Judge must dismiss a CFJ if one of the following is true of
      it:

        i) It contains no clearly-identifiable Statement.
       ii) Its Statement can not logically admit to either being TRUE
           or FALSE.
      iii) Its Statement does not relate to a matter relevant to the
           Rules.
       iv) Its Statement fails to comply with the Rules.
        v) It lacks standing, as defined elsewhere.
       vi) After a reasonable effort by the Judge to obtain all
           relevant information, no determination can be made of the
           truth or falsity of its Statement.

      The Judge does this by notifying the CotC of the CFJ's
      dismissal, and the reasons e is doing so.  Dismissals are only
      legal when made for the reasons listed in this Rule.  Dismissal
      occurs when the CotC is notified of a legal dismissal.

      As soon as possible after being notified of a legal dismissal,
      the CotC must post to the Public Forum a notice of the dismissal
      and the Judge's reasons for doing so.

      If the dismissal, upon appeal, is subsequently set aside, then
      that CFJ is no longer dismissed. It shall be considered again
      and can not again be legally dismissed for the same reasons.

      A Judge who dismisses a CFJ before the end of the assigned
      deliberation period shall receive a Judicial Salary of 1 VT.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 502/6 (Power=1)
Salary for Judges

      The Clerk of the Courts shall, within one week of the time a
      Player earns a Judicial Salary, pay out that Judicial Salary to
      that Player.

      If a decision (or dismissal) which resulted in a Player earning
      a Judicial Salary is subsequently appealed and overturned on
      appeal, the Clerk of the Courts shall vacate the Payment Order
      paying the salary originally received for that decision.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1803/0 (Power=1)
Judicial Orders

      Judicial Orders are executed by being sent to the Clerk of the
      Courts, but do not take effect until their publication by the
      Clerk of the Courts.  The Clerk of the Courts shall publish each
      Judicial Order as soon as possible after receiving it from the
      Judge who executed it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1804/0 (Power=1)
Appeal of Judicial Orders

      Judicial Orders are subject to appeal to a Board of Appeal by a
      Call for Appeal.

      The Board of Appeal shall, upon finding that a Judicial Order is
      improperly or invalidly executed, order that that Order be
      amended or vacated, as it deems appropriate.

      When the Clerk of the Courts receives a properly executed Call
      for Appeal of a Judicial Order, the Clerk of the Courts shall
      stay the Order under appeal.  If the Board of Appeals affirms
      the validity of the original Order, it shall then vacate this
      stay.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1826/0 (Power=1)
Motions

      A Motion is a formal request made by a Player to the Judge of a
      CFJ.

      A Motion is made by submitting it to the Clerk of the Courts,
      clearly identifying the CFJ to which the Motion applies.

      The Clerk of the Courts shall forward each properly-filed Motion
      to the Judge of the CFJ to which the Motion applies as soon as
      possible after receiving it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1827/1 (Power=1)
Granting or Denying Motions

      A Judge must either grant or deny each Motion forwarded to em by
      the Clerk of the Courts, within five days of when the Motion was
      received by the Judge.  E may, but need not, state the reasons
      for eir grant or denial.  A Judge grants or denies a Motion by
      sending eir determination on that Motion to the Clerk of the
      Courts, along with any reasons e chooses to provide.

      The effect of granting a Motion depends on the nature of the
      Motion granted, but generally amounts to requiring the Judge to
      perform as requested by the Motion.

      Upon receipt of a Judge's determination on a Motion, the Clerk
      shall note the determination made and the reasons, if any, on
      the record of the CFJ, and shall notify the Player who made the
      Motion of that determination.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1828/1 (Power=1)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1509/3 (Power=1)
Orders to Compel

      Upon a judicial finding that a Player has failed to perform a
      duty required of em by the Rules, the Judge so finding shall
      execute an Order, requiring that Player to perform that duty as
      soon as possible.  Such an Order is known as an Order to
      Compel.

      If the duty in question arises because the Player in question
      holds a specific Office or other position of official
      responsibility, the Order shall be directed to that Office or
      position.  If the Player holding that Office fails to perform
      the duty in question as ordered, the Judge shall Order that that
      Player be removed from Office or position.

      If the duty in question arises for a reason not related to the
      Player in question holding a specific Office or official
      position, and that Player fails to perform the duty as ordered,
      the Judge shall amend the Order to require the Speaker to
      perform that duty instead.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1829/1 (Power=1)
Refusal of Duty by the Speaker

      If the Speaker is convicted of the Crime of Contempt by
      Inaction, relating to a validly issued Order to Compel which was
      directed at the position of Speaker, the Speaker becomes
      Tainted.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1830/0 (Power=1)
No Compulsion of Judges

      No valid Order to Compel may be directed to a Judge, or may
      require the performance of any duty required of Player by the
      virtue of that Player being a Judge.  Any such Order is invalid.
      Any CFJ alleging that a Judge has failed to perform a duty of a
      judicial nature shall be dismissed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 789/5 (Power=1)
Orders to Annotate Rules

      The Judge of any CFJ, the Statement of which alleges that a Rule
      should be interpreted in a certain way, which is judged TRUE,
      may, at eir discretion, issue an Order requiring the Rulekeepor
      to annotate the Rule in question with the Statement of that CFJ.
      Such an annotation, while it exists, shall guide application of
      that Rule.

      The Rulekeepor may remove such an annotation only if that
      Rule is repealed; if required to do so by a valid Order;
      or if the original Order to annotate is amended, stayed, or
      vacated.  The Rulekeepor may vacate an Order to annotate
      a Rule Without Objection.  Annotations to a Rule may not be
      modified in any way except as specified in this Rule.

      If a Player believes that an annotation is no longer pertinent,
      e may file, in the original CFJ from which the Order of
      Annotation arises, a Motion to Vacate the Order of Annotation.
      If such a Motion is granted, the Judge granting it shall Order
      the original Order Vacated and shall Order the Rulekeepor to
      remove the annotation in question.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1500/6 (Power=1)
Orders to Annotate SLCs

      The Judge of any CFJ, the Statement of which alleges that an SLC
      should be interpreted in a certain way, which is judged TRUE,
      may, at eir discretion, issue an Order requiring the Maintainer
      of that SLC to annotate the SLC in question with the Statement
      of that CFJ.  Such an annotation, while it exists, shall guide
      application of that SLC.

      The Maintainer of that SLC may remove such an annotation only
      if the SLC ceases to exist; if required to do so by a valid
      Order; or if the original Order to Annotate is amended, stayed,
      or vacated.  The Maintainer of an SLC may vacate an Order to
      annotate that SLC Without Objection.  Annotations to an SLC may
      not be modified in any way except as specified in this Rule.

      If a Player believes that an annotation is no longer pertinent,
      e may file, in the original CFJ from which the Order of
      Annotation arises, a Motion to Vacate the Order of Annotation.
      If such a Motion is granted, the Judge granting it shall Order
      the original Order Vacated and shall Order the Maintainer of
      that SLC to remove the annotation in question.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1742/1 (Power=1)
Agreements between Players

      If two (or more) Players enter into an agreement, but one (or
      more) of these Players then fails to comply with that agreement,
      any other Player party to that agreement may make a CFJ alleging
      that that agreement has been broken.

      If the Judge of such a CFJ finds that the agreement has in fact
      been broken, e is permitted to issue Orders binding upon
      any or all of the parties of the broken agreement so as to
      effect fair and appropriate restitution for its breach.  When
      restitution would involve the transfer of Currencies, the Judge
      is authorized to execute whatever Payment Orders are necessary
      to effect fair and appropriate restitution.

      The above notwithstanding, no restitution shall be available
      with respect to the breach of the agreement which would have
      required a Player to break the Rules, nor shall restitution
      include the execution of Payment Orders, the payor of which is
      any entity not party to the agreement.

      Nothing in this Rule shall be construed so as to impair the
      enforcement of an agreement which requires a Player to violate
      another agreement.

      A CFJ alleging that an agreement has been broken called by
      anyone who is not party to that agreement lacks standing and
      shall be dismissed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1365/6 (Power=1)
Concurring and Dissenting Opinions

      There shall exist a type of Application called an Application
      to Submit an Opinion.  Such an Application, if effective, has
      the effect of annotating a Judgement or Dismissal in a given
      Call for Judgement.  In order for such an Application to have
      effect upon Execution, it must satisfy the following
      requirements:

      * It must clearly indicate to which CFJ it applies.
      * It must be labeled as either a Concurring Opinion or
        a Dissenting Opinion.
      * It must indicate whether the Judgement or Dismissal to
        which it applies is that of the Judge or that of the
        Appeals Court.
      * It must be accompanied by reasons and arguments, which
        may include, but are not necessarily limited to, citations
        of deciding Rules, past Judgements, and Game Custom.
      * It must bear the Signatures of at least two Players.
      * It must be Executed no earlier than the submission of the
        Judgement or Dismissal to which it applies, and no later than
        one week after the publication by the Clerk of the Courts of
        that Judgement or Dismissal.

      An Application to Submit an Opinion is Executed by submitting
      it to the Clerk of the Courts.  Such an Application, having
      been Executed and having met all the requirements for
      effectiveness, is also called an Opinion.  It is also referred
      to as a Concurring Opinion or a Dissenting Opinion, as
      indicated in the Opinion.

      Once an Application to Submit an Opinion is Executed and takes
      effect, the Clerk of the Courts must distribute the Opinion to
      all Players as soon as possible.  Furthermore, the Opinion must
      be appended to the Legal Judgement or Dismissal.

Rule 911/8 (Power=1)
The Board of Appeals

      When an appeal is initiated, a Board of Appeals shall be
      selected in order to reach a decision about the consideration
      mandated by the appeal.

      A Board of Appeals consists of three distinct Players, called
      Justices.  The Clerk of the Courts selects the Justices for each
      Board, as follows, until three eligible Justices have been
      selected;  The Speaker is selected, if eligible; The Justiciar
      is selected, if eligible; The CotC is selected, if eligible; Any
      remaining positions are then filled by random selection, by the
      CotC, from all remaining eligible Players.

      A Player is ineligible for selection if any of the following is
      true:

        i) E has already been selected to serve on that Board.
       ii) E has been dismissed as Justice from that Board.
      iii) E has been Judge in the matter the Board is to consider.
       iv) E was not eligible to Judge the CFJ that resulted in the
           matter under consideration when it was called, and this
           restriction does not prevent three eligible Players from
           being selected by the CotC for the Board.
        v) E is on Hold, and this restriction does not prevent three
           eligible Players from being selected by the CotC for the
           Board.

      A Justice is permitted to appoint another eligible Player to
      replace em as Justice on a given Board, provided the Player
      consents. A Justice does this by notifying the Clerk of the
      Courts of the appointment.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 910/7 (Power=1)
The Justiciar

      Let there exist the Office of the Justiciar, with the duty to
      Judge various matters of law when the Rules so require.

      The Justiciar does not receive a fixed salary.

      The Speaker and the Player holding the Office of the Clerk of
      the Courts are not permitted to nominate in any Election for the
      Office of Justiciar.

      If the Justiciar ever becomes Clerk of the Courts, e is removed
      from the Office of Justiciar.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1833/0 (Power=1)
Lead Justice

      The Lead Justice of a Board of Appeals is the Justiciar, if e is
      serving on that Board, or the Player who serves in the place of
      the Justiciar otherwise.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1570/0 (Power=1)
Announcement of Appeal

      The Clerk of the Courts shall make an announcement in the Public
      Forum as soon as possible after an Appeal has been initiated,
      including in eir announcement the matter of consideration of the
      Appeal and the identity of the Justices selected to serve on the
      Board of Appeals and which (if any) of these Players are
      ineligible to fill the positions to which they have been
      assigned.

      The Clerk shall also make an announcement to the Public Forum as
      soon as possible after any change in the identity of the
      Justices that takes place after the Board has been constituted.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1564/9 (Power=1)
Initiating Appeals

      The Judgement entered in any CFJ by its Judge, the grant or
      denial of any Motion, and the execution of any Judicial Order
      are all subject to review on appeal to a Board of Appeal.  In
      addition, a Board of Appeal shall review any claim that a Judge
      has failed to perform any duty of a Judicial nature which e was
      required to perform.

      In all cases, the insistence of any three Players, posted in the
      Public Forum, is sufficient to initiate the appeal of a
      particular matter.  In the case of the appeal of a Judicial
      Order, the insistence of any Player bound by the Order is
      sufficient.  In the case of a Judgement which convicts a Player
      of a Crime, the insistence of the convicted Player is
      sufficient.

      In each cases before a Board of Appeal, it shall collectively
      decide whether to affirm or to reverse the matter under appeal,
      and shall execute whatever Appellate Orders are necessary to
      enforce its determination.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1447/12 (Power=1)
Final Judgement upon Appeal

      Once a Board of Appeals has been selected to decide a particular
      appeal, the Justices shall, collectively, consider the question.

      Each Justice has seven days, from the point e becomes Justice on
      a particular Board, in which to reach a determination that
      either sustains or overturns the matter being considered by that
      Board and submit it to the CotC.

      Failure to do so is the Infraction of Failing to Judge an
      Appeal, detected and reported by the CotC, bearing a penalty of
      3 Blots, which results in that Justice's dismissal as a Justice
      from that Board. In this case the CotC must randomly select an
      eligible Player to replace em.

      After all three Justices have submitted their determinations to
      the CotC, the CotC shall post these determinations in the Public
      Forum along with any arguments, evidence, or other material
      included with those determinations.

      If a majority of the Justices agree to sustain the matter being
      considered, it is sustained; otherwise, it is overturned.  The
      specific results of overturning a matter upon appeal are
      determined by the Rules permitting such appeals.

      Each Justice who submits eir determination to the CotC before
      the end of the assigned deliberation period shall receive a
      Judicial Salary of 1 VT upon the publication of eir
      determination.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1693/1 (Power=1)
Appeal of a Judgement

      If the Judgement of a CFJ is Appealed, the Board of Appeals
      shall consider the correctness of that Judgement. The Board may
      rule that the original Judgement was either correct or
      incorrect.

      If a majority of the Justices find that the original Judgement
      was correct, then the Board's ruling is that the original
      Judgement was correct. In that case, the original Judge of the
      CFJ shall retain eir Judicial Salary and the original Judgement
      has legal effect.

      If a majority of the Justices find that the original Judgement
      was incorrect, then the Board's ruling is that the original
      Judgement was incorrect. In that case, the original Judge
      of the CFJ shall forfeit eir Judicial Salary. The Board may
      then act in one of three ways, provided that a majority of
      the Justices agree:

        i) Reversal of the Judgement. In this case, the CFJ shall
           be treated as if it were Judged normally, with the
           Judgement being that which a majority of the Justices
           agree on.
       ii) Dismissal of the CFJ. The CFJ shall be considered
           dismissed.
      iii) Re-assignment of the CFJ. In this case, the original
           Judgement shall be ignored, and the CotC shall reassign
           the CFJ to a new Judge in the same fashion as it was
           originally assigned; the original Judge will be
           considered Ineligible. The new Judge cannot make the
           same Judgement as the original Judge for the same
           reason.

      If a majority of the Justices find that the original Judgement
      was incorrect, but no majority of the Justices agree on what
      action to take, then the CFJ shall be re-assigned as above.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1694/0 (Power=1)
Appeal of a Dismissal

      If the dismissal of a CFJ is Appealed, the Board shall not
      consider the truth or falsity of the original CFJ; they
      shall only consider whether the dismissal was properly
      made. An illegal dismissal shall not be considered
      "properly made."

      If the Board finds the dismissal to have been properly
      made, the original Judge of the CFJ shall retain eir
      Judicial Salary, and the CFJ shall remain dismissed.

      If the Board finds the dismissal to have been made
      improperly, the original Judge of the CFJ shall have eir
      Judicial Salary revoked. The CotC shall reassign the CFJ
      to a new Judge in the same fashion as originally
      assigned; the new Judge cannot dismiss it for the same
      reasons as given by the original Judge.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1805/0 (Power=1)
Appellate Orders

      Appellate Orders are executed by being sent to the Clerk of the
      Courts by the Lead Justice of a Board of Appeals, but do not
      take effect until their publication by the Clerk of the Courts.
      The Lead Justice shall certify in eir submission to the Clerk of
      the Courts that the Order is executed by the concurrence of the
      majority of the Justices comprising that Board of Appeals;
      failure to do so deprives the Order of effect.

      The Clerk of the Courts shall publish each Appellate Order as
      soon as possible after receiving it from the Board of Appeal
      which executed it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1806/0 (Power=1)
No Appeal of Appellate Orders

      Appellate Orders are not subject to appeal.  However, upon a
      judicial finding that the required certification was falsely
      provided, the Justiciar shall vacate the Order which was
      accompanied by that false certification.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1807/0 (Power=1)
Validity of Appellate Orders

      Since Appellate Orders cannot be appealed, Appellate Orders are
      valid only if addressed to:
        a) The Clerk of the Courts in eir Official capacity;
        b) an Order issued by the Clerk of the Courts in eir Official
           Capacity;
        c) The Judge of the CFJ which that Board of Appeals was
           convened to consider, or any Order issued by that Judge in
           that particular CFJ; or
        d) any combination of the above.

      All other Appellate Orders are presumptively invalid.

      This Rule takes precedence over all Rules pertaining to the
      validity of Appellate Orders.

      In the appeal of a Judicial Order, the Board shall consider
      whether the Order in question was both legally made and
      appropriate for the situation.

      If the Board finds that the Order was made legally, and was
      appropriate for the situation, it shall affirm the Order.  If an
      Order staying the execution of the appealed Order was entered,
      it shall vacate this stay.

      If the Board finds that the Order was made illegally, or that it
      was inappropriate for the situation, it shall vacate the
      original Order.  Should the Board further find that the Order
      was made without reasonable justification or for a clearly
      improper purpose, it shall (at its discretion) impose a penalty
      of 2 Blots upon the Judge who made the original Order.

Rule Violations
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 908/11 (Power=1)
Formal Apologies

      Upon a judicial finding that a Player (herein called the Ninny)
      has acted or has failed to act in such a way as to be in
      violation of one or more Rules, the Judge so finding shall Order
      that Player to submit, within 72 hours, a Formal Apology.
      However, when the action (or failure to act) is subject to
      penalties by virtue of being defined to be a Crime or an
      Infraction, the Order is optional and may be issued at the
      Judge's discretion.

      A Formal Apology shall consist of a letter of at least 200
      words, to be published by the Ninny in the Public Forum,
      explaining the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
      for self-improvement.

      The Judge issuing such an Order may, at eir discretion, include
      in eir Order a list of up to ten Prescribed Words (to be chosen
      by the Judge) which must be included in the Formal Apology.  If
      the Judge elects to include Prescribed Words, all of the Words
      required must appear within the Formal Apology.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1832/0 (Power=1)
Failure to Apologize

Crimes and Infractions
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1503/4 (Power=1)
Crimes and Infractions

      Any entity who performs an action defined by the Rules to be a
      Crime, or fails to perform an action where such failure is
      defined by the Rules to be a Crime, shall be subject to whatever
      penalty the Rules prescribe for that Crime upon the execution of
      a Sentencing Order executed consequent to a judicial finding
      that e did in fact commit that Crime.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1815/0 (Power=1)
Crimes and Infractions without Penalties

      No action is a Crime or an Infraction unless defined as such by
      the Rules.  If the Rules define an act to be a Crime or an
      Infraction, but fail to prescribe a penalty for that act, then
      there is no penalty for that act.  If the Rules define an act to
      be an Infraction, but fail to authorize any Player or Players to
      report instances of that Infraction, then that Infraction cannot
      be reported.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1504/6 (Power=1)
Sentencing Orders

      The imposition of penalties for the commission of a Crime shall
      be by Sentencing Order(s).  Upon a judicial finding that an
      entity has committed a Crime, the Judge so finding shall execute
      Sentencing Orders sufficient to implement the penalty required
      by the Rules for that Crime.

Rule 1812/0 (Power=1)
Notices of Infraction

      Any entity who performs an action defined by the Rules to be an
      Infraction, or fails to perform an action where such failure is
      defined by the Rules to be an Infraction, shall be subject to
      whatever penalty the Rules prescribe for that Infraction upon a
      Notice of Infraction stating that e committed that Infraction.

      A Notice of Infraction stating that an entity has committed a
      specific Infraction consists of a report by a Player authorized
      to report instances of that specific Infraction that it is eir
      informed belief that the specified entity has committed the
      specified Infraction.  A Notice of Infraction shall also specify
      the penalty to be imposed for that Infraction.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1813/0 (Power=1)
Imposition of Penalties for Infractions

      The imposition of penalties for the commission of an Infraction
      shall be by the execution of a Notice of Infraction.  The Player
      executing the Notice of Infraction shall, at the time e does so,
      also execute Orders sufficient to implement the penalty required
      by the Rules for that Infraction.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1814/1 (Power=1)
Timing of Penalties for Crimes and Infractions

      The punishment for a Crime or Infraction shall be whatever was
      specified by the Rules at the time the action so designated as a
      Crime or an Infraction was committed, even if the Rule or Rules
      which specified the punishment, or which designated the action
      as a Crime or Infraction, have since been amended or repealed.
      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which specifies
      a different penalty for a Crime or Infraction.

Rule 1816/0 (Power=1)
No Double Jeopardy for Crimes

      Any CFJ whose Statement alleges that an entity has, through

      there is a prior CFJ, the statement of which alleges that the
      same entity has, through the same action or inaction, committed
      the same Crime, and which was itself not dismissed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

      Salary, in recognition of eir service.

      The Registrar is obliged to keep the Distributor informed of the

The Office of the Rulekeepor

      There shall exist the Office of Rulekeepor.  The Rulekeepor
      shall receive a Salary equal to 2 times the Basic Officer
      Salary.

      The Rulekeepor shall maintain a complete list of all Rules.  The
      Short Logical Ruleset constitutes the Rulekeepor's Official
      Report. In addition, the Rulekeepor shall post the Full Logical
      Ruleset to the Public Forum at least once each month.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1681/3 (Power=1)
The Logical Rulesets

      There is a format of the Ruleset known as the Short Logical
      Ruleset (SLR).  In this format, each Rule is assigned to a Rule
      Category, and the Rules are grouped according to their Category.
      Within a Category, the ordering of Rules is decided by the
      Rulekeepor.  All existing Rule Categories must be listed, even
      if no Rules are currently assigned to the Category.

      The listing of each Rule in the SLR must include:
        * The Rule Number
        * The Rule's Amendment Number
        * The Rule's Power
        * The Rule's Title
        * The Rule's text
        * Any annotations to the Rule required by Order

      The Rulekeepor is strongly encouraged not to include any
      additional information in the SLR, except that which increases
      the readability of the SLR.

      There is a format of the Ruleset known as the Full Logical
      Ruleset (FLR).  In this format, Rules are assigned to the
      same Category and presented in the same order as in the
      SLR.  The FLR must contain all the information required
      to be in the SLR, as well as:
        * A brief description of each Category
        * Any historical annotations which the Rulekeepor is
          required to record.

      The Rulekeepor is also free to include any other information
      which e feels may be helpful in the use of the Ruleset in the
      FLR.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1048/6 (Power=1)
Rule Categories

      A Rule Change that Creates a new Rule may specify an existing
      Category to which the new Rule will be assigned.  If it does
      not, the Rulekeepor shall choose the new Rule's Category.  When
      doing so, the Rulekeepor may create a new Rule Category and
      assign the Rule to this new Category.

      The Rulekeepor may remove an empty Rule Category as e sees fit.

      If the Rulekeepor creates or removes a Category, e must announce
      it in the Public Forum no later than the first subsequent
      publication of the Logical Ruleset.

      The Rulekeepor is authorized to change the name of a Rule
      Category or change the Category to which a Rule is assigned
      Without Objection.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1691/0 (Power=1)
Category of New Rules

      A new Rule shall be assigned to whatever Rule Category is
      specified by the instrument which created it, if the Rule
      Category specified exists.  If there is no such specification or
      a category which does not exist is specified, the Rulekeepor
      shall assign the Rule to an appropriate Rule Category of eir own
      choice.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1485/7 (Power=1)
Titles for Rules

      All Rules have a Title, which is a single line of text
      containing not more than 60 characters.  The Title must be
      listed by the Rulekeepor along with the Rule.  However, the
      Title is not part of the Rule itself and has no effect on the
      meaning or application of the Rule, being merely a convenience
      for the Players.

      A Rule Change that Creates a new Rule may specify a Title for
      the new Rule.  If it does not, the Rulekeepor shall choose the
      new Rule's Title.

      The Rulekeepor is authorized to change the Title of a Rule
      Without Objection.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1430/2 (Power=1)
Mandatory Rule Annotations

      Whenever a Rule is changed in any way, the Rulekeepor shall
      record a historical annotation to the Rule giving the type of
      change, the source of the Change (that is, the Number of the
      Proposal and the Entity that proposed it, or Rule-- or other
      entity-- which mandated the Change), and the date upon which the
      change took effect.  Other Rules may require additional
      information to appear in an annotation for certain types of Rule
      Change.

      Such an annotation does not in any way affect the Rule itself,
      is not part of the text of the Rule, and is not a Rule Change in
      its own regard.  The Rulekeepor shall indicate all annotations
      in such a way that they are readily distinguished from the text
      of the Rule.

      When a Rule is repealed, all annotations attached to it are
      discarded, and need not appear in the published Ruleset.

      have been awarded, and to whom they have been awarded, with the
      exception of any such events of which the Rules state that they
      have no Historical Significance.  This list is known as the Gold

      Player may hold the Patent Title of Hero.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 840/7 (Power=1)

======================================================================
Degrees and Theses
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1367/3 (Power=1)
Degrees

      There shall exist a subset of the Patent Titles known as
      Degrees. A Patent Title is only a Degree if it is specifically
      made such by a Rule. A person may use a Degree with their name
      for any official or unofficial business if and only if that
      person currently possesses that Degree.

      Persons may come to possess Degrees only as specified in the
      Rules. Once a person possesses a Degree, e shall keep that
      Degree forever.

      The Registrar shall note in eir report which persons possess
      which Degrees.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule specifying default
      properties of Patent Titles.

      "Granting a Degree" and "awarding a Degree" are synonymous.  A
      Player who has been awarded a Degree possesses that Degree.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1368/2 (Power=1)
The Legal Degrees

      The following Degrees are hereby made legal:

         - Doctor of Nomic Philosophy         (D.N.Phil)

      Degrees shall be ranked in the order they appear in this Rule,
      with Degrees listed latest in the Rule being ranked higher than
      Degrees listed earlier. The abbreviations in parentheses are not
      part of the actual Degree.

Rule 1369/0 (Power=1)
Theses

      There shall be a Nomic Entity known as a Thesis, plural Theses.

      A Thesis shall be an essay whose topic is any facet of Agora
      Nomic, or Nomic in general. The topic should be substantially
      different from all other Theses previously approved, but this
      is not a requirement.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1370/9 (Power=1)
How to Get a Degree

      A Degree is Granted by the operation of an instrument of
      sufficient Power specifying the Degree to be Granted, and its
      recipient.  The sufficient Power required to Grant a Degree is
      determined by the Degree to be Granted.  All conditions
      established by this and other Rules for the Granting of the
      named Degree must have been fulfilled before the Degree may be
      Granted.

      No Degree may be Granted to any recipient unless the recipient
      has posted a Thesis to the Public Forum authored by eirself,
      along with a statement explicitly indicating that the Thesis is
      being submitted with the intent to qualify for a Degree.  The
      Rulekeepor shall retain a copy of each Thesis posted in this
      manner.

      The Degree of Bachelor of Nomic shall not be Granted unless the
      Thesis submitted for that Degree contains at least 500 words,
      and unless the instrument Granting the Degree has Power of at
      least 1.

      The Degree of Doctor of Nomic History shall not be Granted
      unless the Thesis submitted for that Degree contains at least
      500 words and contains a narrative covering significant events

======================================================================
Currencies
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1467/4 (Power=1)
Definition of a Currency

      There are certain entities which are Currencies.  An entity is a
      Currency if and only if it has been made such by the Rules, and
      if and only if it complies with all the requirements in the
      Rules pertaining to Currencies.

      Neither Currencies nor units of Currency shall be created or
      destroyed except as specified by the Rules.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1576/0 (Power=1)
Names of Currencies

      Each Currency shall have a name, which must be distinct from the
      name of every other Currency.

      Any attempt to create a Currency with the same name as an
      already existing Currency fails.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1577/2 (Power=1)
Minimum Unit Quantities (MUQ)

      Each Currency shall have associated with it a Minimum Unit
      Quantity (MUQ).  This quantity is the smallest amount of that
      Currency which is permitted to be transferred.  All transfers
      and holdings of a Currency shall be rounded off to the nearest
      multiple of its MUQ.

      The MUQ of a given Currency is 1 if no other specification
      exists.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1578/4 (Power=1)
Currency Recordkeepors

      Each Currency shall have associated with it a Recordkeepor,
      which must be a Player.  The Recordkeepor of a Currency is
      required to maintain a record of the amounts of that Currency
      held by the various entities which possess units of that
      Currency.

      If the designated Recordkeepor of a Currency ceases to be a
      Player, the Speaker shall fulfill that responsibility until a
      new Recordkeepor is selected according to whatever procedure
      applies.  If there is no procedure defined for selecting a new
      Recordkeepor, then all units of that Currency are destroyed and
      the Currency ceases to exist.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1579/5 (Power=1)
Mintors

      Each Currency shall have associated with it a Mintor, which must
      be an entity to which the Rules grant Mint Authority.  An entity
      has Mint Authority if and only if granted it by the Rules.

      If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist, or ceases to have
      the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that Currency
      are destroyed, and that Currency ceases to exist.  The
      Recordkeepor of that Currency shall publically announce when
      this happens.

      All Players have Mint Authority.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1722/1 (Power=1)
Minting of Currencies

      A new Currency is created when an entity which has Mint
      Authority posts to the Public Forum a message stating that e is
      doing so, provided that also e states in that message the values
      of all properties which the Rules require of Currencies.  The
      Mintor of a Currency created in this way is the entity which
      created it, any specification to the contrary notwithstanding.
      If the Recordkeepor of the Currency to be created is not the
      Executor of the Mintor, the proposed Recordkeepor must first
      consent to being its Recordkeepor before the Currency is
      created.

      A Currency is destroyed when the Mintor of that Currency posts
      in the Public Forum stating that e is doing so, unless this
      destruction would be prohibited by the Rules.

      The Mintor of a Currency may not destroy that Currency if that
      Currency exists by virtue of being required to exist by the
      Rules.

      The Recordkeepor of a Currency created by the procedure in this
      Rule is changed when the Mintor of that Currency announces the
      change; but if the new Recordkeepor is not the Executor of the
      Mintor, the new Recordkeepor must first consent to being made
      Recordkeepor.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1721/0 (Power=1)
The Chancellor

      There shall exist the Office of Chancellor.

      The Chancellor shall retain a schedule, listing every Currency
      which exists, detailing for each Currency the Name, Mintor,
      Recordkeepor, and MUQ of that Currency.  This schedule shall be
      posted to the Public Forum by the Chancellor at least once in
      each Month.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1471/2 (Power=1)
Creation and Destruction of Currencies

      New units of a Currency are created when the Mintor of that
      Currency transmits to the Recordkeepor of that Currency a notice
      that e is creating new units of that Currency, specifying the
      number of units that e is creating.  The newly created units are
      added to the Mintor's possessions.

      Units of Currency are destroyed when any entity which possesses
      units of that Currency transmits to the Recordkeepor of that
      Currency a notice that e is destroying units of that Currency,
      specifying the number of units that e is destroying.  An entity
      cannot destroy more units of a Currency than e possesses,
      however.  The units destroyed are removed from the possession of
      the entity performing the destruction.

      A Transfer Order is an Order requiring the Recordkeepor of a
      Currency to note the transfer of units of that Currency from one
      entity to another.  A valid Transfer Order specifies exactly one
      source entity, exactly one destination entity, exactly one
      Currency, and a number of units of that Currency which is a
      positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ.  If a Transfer Order
      purports to satisfy a particular Payment Order and either that
      Payment Order does not exist or cannot be satisfied by the
      Transfer Order, then the Transfer Order is invalid.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1817/0 (Power=1)
Recordkeepors' Obedience to Transfer Orders

      A Recordkeepor is required to abide by all valid Transfer Orders
      submitted by the Executor of the owner of the units of Currency
      to be transferred (or, with respect to any entity which lacks an
      Executor, by any other person empowered by the Rules to execute
      Transfer Orders on the behalf of such entities), except for
      those transfers which would result in an entity possessing a
      negative quantity of Currency.  Transfers shall be noted on the
      Recordkeepor's records in the order in which they are received
      by the Recordkeepor.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1818/0 (Power=1)
Vacation of Transfer Orders

      If a Recordkeepor notes a transfer pursuant to a Transfer Order
      which is subsequently vacated, e shall correct eir records as
      soon as possible after the Transfer Order is vacated by noting a
      transfer which is the reverse of the transfer originally noted.
      However, if such a reversing transfer would result in an entity
      possessing a negative quantity of units of Currency, e shall
      instead execute a Payment Order requiring a Transfer Order that
      would have the same effect as the reversing transfer.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1819/0 (Power=1)
Effect of Transfer Orders

      The effect of noting a transfer on the records of the
      Recordkeepor is to remove the specified number of units of
      Currency from the holdings of the source entity and to add the
      specified number of units of Currency to the holdings of the
      destination entity.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1820/0 (Power=1)
Recording of Transfer Orders

      Each Recordkeepor shall maintain a record of all Transfer Orders
      submitted which specify the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor, for at least four weeks after their submission,
      and a complete record of all transfers noted upon eir records
      for at least four weeks.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1730/1 (Power=1)
Delayed Transfer Orders

      The Recordkeepor of a Currency may, at eir discretion, elect to
      refuse any Transfer Order which requires em to note a transfer
      at any time other than as soon as possible after the Order
      itself became effective.  The Recordkeepor's election to refuse
      an Transfer Order in this fashion renders invalid that Order
      provided that the Recordkeepor sends a message to the Player who
      executed the Order informing him of eir election, within seven
      days of the receipt of that Order.

      This Rule does not apply to Transfer Orders which are required
      by the Rules to be executed with a specification that the
      transfer be noted at a time other than as soon as possible after
      they become effective.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1596/3 (Power=1)
Payment Orders

      A Payment Order is an Order requiring an entity (the payor) to
      submit a Transfer Order transferring units of a Currency from
      itself to some other entity (the payee).  A Payment Order
      specifies exactly one source entity, exactly one destination
      entity, exactly one Currency, and a number of units of that
      Currency which is a positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1821/0 (Power=1)
Validity of Payment Orders

      A Payment Order is only valid if a copy has been filed with the
      Recordkeepor of the Currency specified in it, and takes effect
      no sooner than the time of such filing.  (Publishing the Payment
      Order in the Public Forum is sufficient to meet this
      requirement.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1822/0 (Power=1)
Recording of Payment Orders

      Each Recordkeepor shall maintain a record of all Payment Orders
      filed with em which specify the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor.  This record shall also indicate, for each Order,
      if that Order has been satisfied, vacated, or both.  However,
      the Recordkeepor need only maintain records of satisfied or
      vacated Orders for four weeks after they have been satisfied or
      vacated.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1823/0 (Power=1)
Combining Payment Orders

      If a Player is required to execute two or more Payment Orders,
      all of which name the same Payor, Payee, and Currency, that
      Player may elect to instead execute one Payment Order naming
      that Payor, Payee and Currency, and for an amount equal to the
      sum of all such Payment Orders required.  Doing so satisfies by
      substitution the requirement to execute all such Payment Orders.

      This Rule may not be applied with respect to any Payment Order
      required consequent to the vacation or stay of another Payment
      Order or of a Transfer Order.

      Payment Orders to be executed for the purpose of paying for
      Voting upon Proposals may not be combined by this Rule with
      Payment Orders executed for any other purpose.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1732/2 (Power=1)
Satisfaction of Payment Orders

      A Payment Order is satisfied when a Transfer Order to the payee
      of that Payment Order for the currency and amount named in that
      Payment Order is successfully executed, provided that, when that
      Transfer Order was submitted, its submitter clearly indicated
      that that Transfer Order was being submitted for the purpose of
      satisfying the Payment Order in question.

      A given Payment Order can be satisfied at most once.  A vacated
      Payment Order cannot be satisfied.

      A given Transfer Order may be used for the purpose of satisfying
      at most one Payment Order.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1734/1 (Power=1)
Vacated Payment Orders

      When a satisfied Payment Order is vacated, the Recordkeepor of
      the Currency named in that Payment Order shall execute a new
      Payment Order identical to the vacated Payment Order, but with
      the payor and payee interchanged.

      If the Order vacating the original Payment Order is subsequently
      stayed or vacated, then the Recordkeepor shall stay or vacate,
      respectively, the reversing Order required by this Rule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1713/7 (Power=1)
Debt

      An Overdue Payment Order is a Payment Order which is presently
      effective, has been effective for more than seven days, and has
      not been satisfied, unless the Payment Order was issued while
      the Payor was On Hold, in which case the Payment Order becomes
      overdue if it has been effective and unsatisfied for more than
      seven days after the Payor first comes Off Hold.

      If the Executor of an entity for which, at the beginning of a
      given Nomic week, there is at least one Overdue Payment Order
      naming it as Payor is not on hold, e commits the Infraction of
      Persistent Indebtedness at the beginning of that Week. If the
      Executor of such an entity comes off hold, e commits the
      Infraction of Persistent Indebtedness.  If an entity has more
      than one Overdue Payment Order naming it as payor, its Executor
      commits as many such Infractions as there are different
      Currencies named in all these Overdue Payment Orders.

      The Recordkeepor of each Currency is authorized to report this
      Infraction with respect to the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor.  This Infraction carries a penalty of one Blot.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1853/2 (Power=1)
Levying Taxes

      When (and only when) a Player is empowered to levy a tax on a
      Currency, e may do so by announcing the levy in the Public
      Forum. The announcement must specify which Currency the tax in
      being levied on (and this must be a Currency on which the Player
      making the announcement is empowered to levy a tax), and the
      amount of the levy, expressed as a percentage of holdings of
      that Currency, which each entity in possession of that Currency
      will be required to pay to the Bank (the levy must be the same
      for all entities). Unless the rule(s) authorizing a particular
      tax explicitly say so, the amount of the levy of that tax may
      never be larger than 50%.  As soon as possible after making the
      announcement, the Accountor is required to execute Payment
      Orders naming each entity other than the Bank in possession of
      the named Currency as payor, and with the Bank as payee, for an
      amount of the named Currency equal to the amount of the levy.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1661/5 (Power=1)
The Right of Patronage

      A Speaker who is not Tainted has the Right of Patronage.  This
      Right is the authority to, once a week, order the award of
      specific currencies from the Bank to specific Players, only as
      specified in this Rule.

      The Speaker exercises this right by posting to the Public Forum
      a Payment Order from the Bank to one Player for not more
      than 1 unit of any one Currency Minted by the Bank.  The Player
      to receive the award must not have received a Patronage award
      within the preceding four weeks, and the Speaker must provide a
      reason along with the Payment Order.

      Such awards are only permitted to recognize acts the Speaker
      believes to be of benefit to the Agora community, acts that the
      Speaker believes to exceed the call of duty, or acts that the
      Speaker believes to be of extreme sacrifice for the good of the
      Game.

======================================================================
Probate
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1601/5 (Power=1)
Probate

      The Notary shall place in Probate any entity which possesses
      Units of Currency or which is named as the Payee or Payor of any
      Payment Order, which does not have an Executor, and which is not
      already in Probate, as soon as possible after being made aware
      of this condition.

      No entity may be destroyed while it possesses Units of Currency
      or while it is named as the Payee or Payor of any Payment
      Orders; any attempt to destroy an entity while it is in this
      condition shall be deferred until this condition no longer
      holds, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding. An entity which
      would otherwise be destroyed but the destruction of which is
      being deferred due to the foregoing provisions is called
      'terminal'.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would destroy an
      entity while it possesses units of Currency.

      The following definitions apply with respect to entities in
      Probate:

      1. Assets: all units of Currency held by the entity in Probate,
         along with all Payment Orders naming the entity in Probate as
         payee.

      2. Debt: a Payment Order naming the entity in Probate as payor.

      3. Credit: a Payment Order naming the entity in Probate as
         payee.

      4. Creditor: an entity which is the payee of a debt.

      5. Debtor: an entity which is the payor of a credit.

      6. Heir: an entity named in the Will (if any) of the entity in
         Probate.

      7. Estate: the assets and debts of the entity in Probate.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1637/3 (Power=1)
Wills

      A Will is an SLC.  The Jurisdiction of a Will is always empty.
      Each Will belongs to exactly one entity.  The Notary
      shall be the Maintainer of all Wills.

      A Will shall specify the heirs of the entity to which it
      belongs, and how the currencies possessed by that entity and
      its other assets will be divided amongst those heirs when that
      entity is placed in Probate.  When an entity's Will is
      executed, the Executor in Probate of that entity will first
      submit all the Transfer Orders required by the Will (excepting
      those which e cannot execute or cannot execute successfully, for
      whatever reason), and will then divide the remaining residual
      assets as provided by the Will.

      A Will is created or amended by the Execution of an Application
      to Create a Will.  Such an Application must clearly identify the
      entity to which the Will is to belong, requires the
      Signature of the Executor of the entity to which the Will is
      to belong, and is Executed by submitting it to the
      Notary.  The effect of Executing such an Application is to
      create a Will belonging to that entity.  Any prior Will
      belonging to that entity is destroyed at the same time.

      A Will belonging to an Organization is not an SLC associated to
      that Organization, as defined elsewhere.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1738/4 (Power=1)
Trustees

      Whenever there is an entity in Probate which does not have a
      Trustee, the Notary shall nominate a Player to be that entity's
      Trustee.  E shall announce this appointment in the Public Forum.

      As soon as possible after the Notary announces the appointment
      of a Trustee for an entity in Probate, each Recordkeepor, with
      respect to the Currency of which e is the Recordkeepor, shall
      provide to that Trustee an accounting of the number of units of
      that Currency held by the entity in Probate, and a list of all
      Payment Orders naming the entity in Probate as either Payor or
      Payee.

      As soon as possible after the Trustee has received all of the
      reports required by the previous paragraph, e shall formulate
      and announce in the Public Forum a Plan for the disposition of
      the estate of the entity in Probate according to the provisions
      of the Probate Code.  However, if the Trustee determines, during
      the course of constructing the Plan, that any of the credits or
      debts of the entity in Probate is disputed, e shall announce
      this fact in the Public Forum, and shall neither formulate nor
      announce a Plan until after the dispute has been settled, and
      shall do so as soon as possible after the dispute has been
      settled.

      If no legally-made objection to the Plan is posted in the Public
      Forum during a waiting period of seven days following its
      announcement, the Trustee shall, as soon as possible after the
      expiration of this waiting period, perform whatever steps are
      necessary to implement the Plan for disposition.  If there is a
      legally-made objection, the Trustee shall, as soon as possible
      after the objection is announced, formulate and announce a new
      Plan as above, repeating the process until there is no
      objection.

      However, if a CFJ is made alleging that an objection to a
      Trustee's Plan lacks foundation, then the Trustee shall neither
      formulate a new Plan nor implement the existing Plan until the
      CFJ is resolved.  If a CFJ finds that an objection lacks
      foundation, then the Trustee may proceed as if that objection
      had never been made, and any attempt to announce that same
      objection again is not legally made.

      An objection to a Plan for disposition has foundation if it
      properly alleges that:
        a) the Plan constructed is not in accord with the provisions
           of the Probate Code;
        b) the Plan disregards the Will (if any) of the entity in
           Probate;
        c) the implementation of the Plan as constructed would be
           substantially unfair to a creditor or heir of the entity in
           Probate; or
        d) the Plan would not fully dispose of the estate of the
           entity in Probate.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1739/1 (Power=1)
The Probate Code

      The Plan for the disposition of the estate of an entity in
      Probate shall be constructed by its Trustee as detailed below.

      First, the Plan shall divide the assets of the estate amongst
      its creditors, assigning to each creditor assets equal to the
      amount due that creditor if possible, or a pro-rata portion if
      not.  All debts, whether satisfied in full or not, shall be
      cancelled.

      Next, if the entity in Probate is terminal, the Plan shall apply
      the Will, if any, of the entity in Probate to the extent
      possible.  Any assets remaining after the application of the
      Will shall be divided amongst the heirs named in the Will,
      assigning to each heir a portion computed in a manner consistent
      with the Will; if the Will is silent or unclear on the division
      of remaining assets, the division shall be equal.

      Next, if the entity in Probate is terminal, and there is no Will
      or the Will fails to fully dispose of all assets of the entity
      in Probate, the Plan shall then cancel all remaining credits and
      assign all remaining units of Currency to the Bank.

      Units of Currency are assigned to an entity by requiring a
      Transfer Order for those Units of Currency from the entity in
      Probate to that Entity.

      A credit is assigned to an entity by requiring a Payment Order
      from the payor of the credit to the entity to whom it has been
      assigned; however, if the payor of the credit is the same as the
      entity to whom it is to be assigned, no Payment Order shall be
      required.

      A debt is cancelled by requiring the vacation of the Payment
      Order which established it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1757/2 (Power=1)
Implementation of Probate Plans

      The Trustee of an entity in Probate is empowered to submit on
      behalf of that entity whatever Transfer Orders are necessary to
      implement eir Plan for the disposition of that entity's Estate,
      as if e were that entity's Executor.  The Trustee may also
      execute and vacate Payment Orders when necessary to implement
      the Plan for the disposition of the Estate.

      The Trustee may exercise the above powers only when implementing
      a Plan for the disposition of the Estate of the entity in
      Probate of which e is the Trustee.

      The Trustee of an entity in Probate ceases to be Trustee when:
        a) e announces in the Public Forum that e resigns as Trustee;
        b) e ceases to be a Player;
        c) the entity of which e is Trustee ceases to be in Probate;
           or
        d) the Notary announces that e has been removed as Trustee.

      An entity in Probate ceases to be in Probate when its Trustee
      announces the completion of the implementation of a Plan for the
      disposition of the Estate of that entity.

Rule 1735/0 (Power=1)
The Chancellor As Bank's Executor

      The Chancellor is the Executor of the Bank.  As soon as possible
      after a Payment Order is executed for which the Bank is the
      payor, the Chancellor shall either (as the Bank's Executor)
      satisfy the Payment Order, or dispute it by making a COE or
      CFJ.  However, the Chancellor need not do so if another Player
      makes such a COE or CFJ first.

      If the Chancellor submits a Transfer Order from the Bank for any
      reason other than to satisfy a Payment Order (except when
      specifically required by the Rules to submit a Transfer Order),
      e commits the Class A Crime of Misappropriation, and upon
      conviction of this Crime shall be removed from Office.

Rule 1696/5 (Power=1)
Voting Tokens

      Voting Tokens (VTs) are a Currency.  The MUQ of VTs is 0.01.
      The Recordkeepor for VTs is the Accountor.  The Mintor of
      VTs is the Bank.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1785/0 (Power=1)
The Accountor

      There is an Office of Accountor, whose Salary is 1.5 times the
      Basic Officer Salary, and whose responsibility it is to be the
      Recordkeepor for Voting Tokens. The Accountor's Report includes
      the number of Voting Tokens possessed by each entity which
      possesses them, and any changes thereto since the last posting
      of the Accountor's Report.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1852/1 (Power=1)
Circulation of Voting Tokens

      The amount of a Currency in circulation is the amount of that
      Currency possessed by entities other than the Bank, minus the
      total of the undisputed Payment Orders for that Currency naming
      entities other than Bank as payor, and the Bank as payee.

      The Voting Token Circulation Level is a number which indicates
      an approximate upper limit on how many Voting Tokens per Player
      are in circulation.

      The Accountor can set the Voting Token Circulation Level by
      announcing in the Public Forum that e is doing so, provided
      that e announces a value between 0 and 15 inclusive, and that
      the Voting Token Circulation Level has not already been set by
      a similar such announcement earlier in the Week.

      The Accountor is responsible for ensuring that the number of
      Voting Tokens per Player in circulation does not exceed the
      Voting Token Circulation Level. To this end, at any time at
      which the number of Voting Tokens per Player in circulation
      does exceed the Voting Token Circulation Level, but only at
      such a time, the Accountor is empowered and required to levy a
      tax on Voting Tokens, as described in other Rules.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1862/1 (Power=1)
The Voting Tariff

      The Voting Tariff is a number of VTs, a multiple of the
      MUQ, between 0 and 2 inclusive. Unless the Rules give
      it another value, the Voting Tariff is 1 VT.

      The Assessor may change the value of the Voting Tariff by
      announcing the new value in the Public Forum, provided that
      e announces a value within the range proscribed above, that
      e makes the announcement prior to midnight GMT Thursday, and
      that e has not already made such an announcement earlier in
      the Week. The new value of the Voting Tariff does not take
      effect until the beginning of the Nomic Week after the
      change has been announced.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1442/15 (Power=1)
The Cost of Voting

      Proposals have a voting cost, equal to the Voting Tariff
      at the time they were distributed. If there was no value
      set for the Voting Tariff at that time, then the voting
      cost is 1 VT.

      As soon as possible after the end of the Voting Period of a
      given Proposal, the Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity a
      number of Voting Tokens equal to the votes cast on that
      Proposal by that entity multiplied by the voting cost for
      that Proposal.

Ways to Win and Preclusions Thereof

      Ways for a Player to Win a Game may be defined by other Rules.
      Also, ways to prevent a Player from Winning a Game may be

      to this announcement.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1622/2 (Power=1)
Forfeiting the Game

      Players shall be permitted to forfeit the current Game by
      sending a notification to that effect to the Public Forum.
      Forfeiting the current Game is a Win-preventing condition which
      prevails from the time of such notification until either some
      other Player has won the Game, or until three months have
      elapsed from the time of the notification, whichever comes
      first.

      Being the only Active Player who has not forfeited the current
      Game constitutes a Win condition.

Rule 1697/0 (Power=1)
Multiple Rapid Wins Prohibited

      Any Player who has Won twice within a given seven day period is
      prohibited from Winning again during that period.  This is a
      Win-Preventing condition for that Player.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1638/1 (Power=1)
Announcing a Win

      Whenever a Player is required to report that a Win has occurred,
      e shall do so by posting to the Public Forum the following
      information :
        i) The fact someone has won the Game
       ii) The date of the win, correct to within 36 hours
      iii) The cause of the win
       iv) The identity of the Player or Players who Won the Game

      Any communication pertaining to a Win shall be a legal and
      correct announcement of same if and only if it contains all
      required information.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 755/7 (Power=1)
Champions

      There is a class of Patent Titles known as Winners' Cups. There
      are 13 different Cups, ranked in ascending order, the full list
      of which is defined in this Rule.

      Whenever a Player Wins a Game, e shall be awarded the lowest
      Cup, if e has never been awarded a Cup previously; if e already
      is the holder of a Cup, e shall be awarded the Cup immediately
      above the one e already holds, if it exists. Any other Cups
      previously held shall be immediately revoked and lose any
      Historical Significance.

      The Cups are :
       * (1) Paper Cup, (2) Tin Cup, (3) Glass Cup, (4) Crystal Cup
       * (5) Bronze Cup, (6) Silver Cup, (7) Gold Cup, (8) Platinum
         Cup
       * (9) Amber Cup, (10) Ruby Cup, (11) Emerald Cup, (12) Diamond
         Cup
       * (13) Supreme Cup

      The first three groups are known, respectively, as the Plain
      Cups, the Noble Cups and the Extravagant Cups.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1465/11 (Power=1)
Champion's Reward

      At the start of the first Nomic Week after the legal and correct
      announcement that a Player has won a Game, that Player shall
      receive a Champion's Reward.  The Champion's Reward shall last
      for four Nomic weeks from that time, and is then withdrawn from
      that Player.  As soon as possible after the legal and correct
      announcement that a Player has won a Game, the Registrar shall
      pay out four Voting Tokens to that Player.

      Any Player who has been awarded a Champion's Reward that has
      not yet been withdrawn, has the right to cast three votes on
      any Proposal.

      The Registrar shall maintain a list of all Champion's Rewards
      which have been granted and have not yet been withdrawn,
      including to whom they have been granted, and their times of
      commencement and conclusion.  This list is known as the Green
      Pages, and is part of the Registrar's Report.

======================================================================
Indulgences and Blots
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1435/4 (Power=1)
Definition of Indulgences, Blots and Immaculate

      Indulgences are a Currency.  The MUQ of Indulgences is 1.
      The Recordkeepor for Indulgences is the Herald.  The Mintor of
      Indulgences is the Bank.

      The Herald's Report includes the number of Indulgences possessed
      by each entity which possesses them, and the changes thereof
      since the last posting of the Herald's Report.

      A Payment Order for a number of Indulgences, the payee of which
      is the Bank, is known as that number of Blots.  When a Rule
      states that a Player is to gain some number of Blots, a Payment
      Order shall be executed with that Player as the payor, the Bank
      as the payee, and for a number of Indulgences equal to the
      number of Blots that Player is to receive.  This order is to be
      executed by whomever is required to report the change in Blots.

      A Player may be said to have a number of Blots equal to the sum
      of the amounts of all Payment Orders for Indulgences naming em
      as the payor and the Bank as payee, including orders which are
      disputed (but not those which have been vacated).  A Player with
      no such Payment Orders is Immaculate.  It is a Win-Preventing
      condition for a Player to have one or more Blots.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1712/4 (Power=1)
Distribution of Indulgences

      At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Herald shall randomly
      distribute a number of Indulgences equal to one less than the
      difference of the total number of Blots held by all Players
      minus the total number of Indulgences held by all Players:  for
      each such Indulgence, the Herald shall randomly select one
      Player and issue a Payment Order from the Bank to that Player
      for one Indulgence.  If this number is not greater than zero, no
      distribution occurs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1714/3 (Power=1)
Lawlessness

      An Overdue Payment Order that is a number of Blots is that
      number of Overdue Blots.  A Lawless Player is a Player who has
      more than 30 Overdue Blots.

      Whenever a Player correctly alleges in the Public Forum that
      another Player is Lawless, the Lawless Player is removed from
      any Offices e holds, deregistered, and cannot reregister until a
      month has passed.

      If the Lawless Player was the Speaker, the Speaker-Elect first
      immediately becomes Speaker, and the old Speaker ceases to be
      Speaker.

      To incorrectly allege in the Public Forum that a Player is
      Lawless is the Crime of Persecution, a Class A Crime.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would prohibit a
      Lawless Player from being deregistered.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1747/1 (Power=1)
Pardoning Lawlessness

      The Clerk of the Courts has the power to Pardon Lawless Players.
      The Clerk may not exercise this power more than once per Nomic
      month, and may not Pardon the same Player twice in a given term
      of office (although, if re-elected later, e may again Pardon
      that Player).  The Clerk of the Courts Pardons a Player by
      announcing e is doing so in the Public Forum. Then the following
      events shall occur:

        1) The Clerk of the Courts shall request the Herald to
           eliminate all Fugitive Blots owned by the Pardoned Player,
           and the Herald shall do so as soon as possible.

        2) The Clerk of the Courts may, if necessary, vacate any
           Payment Orders for Indulgences possessed by the Pardoned
           Player's estate in order to reduce the number of Blots
           possessed by the Player's estate to below the threshhold
           for Lawlessness. The CotC may not Vacate Payment Orders for
           X number of Indulgences if Vacating PO's for a lesser
           number of Indulgences would suffice to render the Player no
           longer Lawless.

        3) After the above two actions have been completed, the Player
           may reregister.

        4) The Pardoned Player shall then post a Formal Apology to the
           Public Forum for eir Lawlessness. The CotC may include a
           list of up to ten Prescribed Words in eir Pardon.

        5) A Pardoned Player is not subject to Persistent Indebtedness
           penalties for three months after being Pardoned, but during
           this period e must apply all Indulgences received (from
           any source) to eir debt and may not transfer them to
           another Entity.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule governing Lawlessness,
      Fugitive Blots, when a deregistered Player may reregister, or
      Persistent Indebtedness.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1439/6 (Power=1)
Blots Due to a CFJ

      If a Call For Judgement (CFJ) clearly alleging that a Player has
      violated a specific Rule is found to be TRUE, the Player
      receives Blots equal to the Power of the violated Rule rounded
      down to the nearest whole integer, or four Blots if its
      Power exceeds four.  This Rule defers to the wording of the
      violated Rule when it defines a Blot penalty in the specific
      case of a CFJ, or specifically forbids Blot penalties in the
      case of a CFJ.

      The Player who initially called for the CFJ shall make the
      Payment Orders necessary to apply the Blots.

      If such a Judgement is overturned upon appeal, then the Player
      who received Blots shall vacate the Blots that were given due to
      the initial Judgement of the CFJ.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1437/4 (Power=1)
Fugitives from Justice

      When a Player is deregistered from the game while not
      Immaculate, e becomes a Fugitive from Justice, and e receives
      Fugitive Blots equal to the number of Blots e then had.  The
      Herald shall keep a record of the number of Fugitive Blots
      attributed to each Fugitive from Justice.

      At the beginning of each month, the Herald shall halve the
      number of Fugitive Blots attributed to each Fugitive of Justice,
      rounding down; but no Fugitive from Justice shall have the
      number of Fugitive Blots attributed to em reduced to less than
      one by this method.

      When a Fugitive from Justice reregisters, the Herald shall
      assess against em a number of Blots equal to the number of
      Fugitive Blots attributed to em at the time of eir
      reregistration.  Eir Fugitive Blots are then removed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1837/1 (Power=1)
The Miscreant

      Let there exist the Patent Title of "Miscreant".

      If any Player has more than ten Blots, the Player with the most
      Blots earns the Title of Miscreant.  If no Player has the most
      number of Blots, there is no Miscreant.  The Miscreant loses
      eir Title of Miscreant if eir number of Blots drops below ten,
      if another Player gains as many Blots as em, or if another
      Player gains more Blots than em.

      The Herald shall announce in the Public Forum whenever a Player
      receives or loses this Title, as soon as possible after such
      award or revocation occurs.

      A Player with the Title Miscreant counts as two Rebellious
      Players when determining the outcome of a Revolt. This rule
      takes precedence over any other rule determining the outcome
      of a Revolt.

----------------------------------------------------------------------



======================================================================
Changing Speakers
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1647/3 (Power=1)
Office of the Speaker-Elect

      Let there be the Office of Speaker-Elect.  The Speaker-Elect has
      the duty to be the Speaker's successor.  Whenever a
      Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker, e ceases to be Speaker-Elect.
      The Speaker can never hold the Office of Speaker-Elect, even
      temporarily.

      The CotC and Justiciar may not Nominate for the Office of
      Speaker-Elect.

      When the Office of Speaker-Elect is to be held temporarily by a
      Player because of the Speaker-Elect becoming Speaker (or for any
      other reason,) the Office is filled according to the Order of
      Succession, as defined by other Rules, with the Speaker as
      Arbiter of Succession.

      The Speaker-Elect receives no salary for filling the Office of
      Speaker-Elect.

      This rule takes precedence over all other Rules defining the
      characteristics of the Office of Speaker-Elect.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1648/3 (Power=1)
When the Speaker Is Tainted

      If the Rules require that a Speaker Transition occur, and
      the Office of Speaker-Elect is not being held in the normal
      fashion at that time, then the Transition proceeds as set
      out in other Rules, but the new Speaker is Tainted.

      A Tainted Speaker may remain Speaker only until some other
      Player holds the Office of Speaker-Elect in normal fashion, at
      which point, a Speaker Transition occurs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1658/2 (Power=1)
Tainting the Speaker

      A Speaker shall become Tainted when a Referendum calling for the
      Tainting of the Speaker passes. Any Active Player is authorized
      to call such a Referendum at any time, by requesting such to the
      Public Forum.

      This Referendum must name the offending Speaker, and if that
      Player is Speaker upon passage of this Referendum, that Speaker
      is Tainted.

      For this Referendum the default procedure for Referenda is
      modified as follows:

      * The Vote Collector is the Registrar
      * Voting Entities do not include the Speaker.
      * The Adoption Index is 2.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 681/9 (Power=1)
Giving Up Speakership

      If the Speaker announces in the Public Forum that e is giving
      up the Speakership voluntarily, a Speaker Transition occurs.

      As soon as possible after the Transition is completed, the
      new Speaker shall bill the former Speaker one Voting Token.

      When a Speaker voluntarily gives up the Speakership in this
      manner, e is prevented from nominating emself for the Office of
      Speaker-Elect for a period lasting two weeks, or until the
      start of the next quarter, whichever is longest.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1375/6 (Power=1)
Speaker Going On Hold

      A Speaker who goes On Hold while e is still Speaker commits the
      Crime of Speaker Inactivity, a Class B Crime.

      If the Speaker is On Hold, a Speaker Transition occurs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 786/8 (Power=1)
Rule of Succession for Speaker or Speaker-Elect

      When the Office of Speaker-Elect is to be filled temporarily
      according to the Order of Succession, that order is defined to
      be:

      the Promotor
      the Assessor
      the Justiciar
      the Clerk of the Courts
      the Rulekeepor
      the Registrar
      all Officers in order of most recent registration
      all Active Players in order of most recent registration

      except that the Speaker does not appear in the Order.  The Order
      of Succession is determined at the time the Office is to be
      filled.

      Any Rule which requires the Office of Speaker-Elect to be filled
      according to the Order of Succession must specify an Arbiter
      of Succession; if it does not, the Speaker-Elect shall not be
      chosen according to that Rule. This Rule takes precedence over
      such Rules.  (If this would ever result in the Speaker filling
      the Office of Speaker-Elect, then the Speaker-Elect shall
      instead be filled by the Order of Succession, with the Speaker
      as Arbiter of Succession.)

      When the Office of Speaker-Elect is to be filled, the Arbiter of
      Succession shall, as soon as possible, announce in the Public
      Forum that the Office of Speaker-Elect is being temporarily
      filled by this Rule.  Once this announcement has been made, each
      Player has three days to decline to fill the Office by sending a
      message to the Arbiter stating e does so.

      During this three day period, the Office of Speaker-Elect is
      held by that Active Player highest in the order of succession
      who has not yet declined to the Arbiter.  If there is only one
      Active Player in the order of succession who has not declined,
      that Player may not decline.

      At the end of the three days, the Office is filled by the Active
      Player highest on the list of succession who did not decline the
      Office, and that player may no longer decline.

      As soon as possible after, and within four days of, the filling
      of the Office of Speaker-Elect, the Arbiter of Succession shall
      announce which Active Player is now the Speaker-Elect.

      Announcements by the Arbiter have no effect on the identity of
      the Speaker-Elect.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 402/6 (Power=1)
Speaker Transition

      Speaker Transition is a process which commences at the time
      the Rules call for a Speaker Transition to occur, and which
      proceeds as follows:

      (i) when the Speaker Transition commences, the Speaker loses
      all special rights and privileges that accrue to em as a result
      of being Speaker;

      (ii) as soon as possible after the Speaker Transition
      commences, the Registrar shall post to the Public Forum a
      Notice of Speaker Transition, identifying the reason for the
      Transition and the Player who held the Office of Speaker-Elect
      at the time the Transition commenced;

      (iii) provided that the Notice of Speaker Transition is
      correct in its particulars, the posting of the Notice
      causes the Player identified in it to cease being the
      Speaker-Elect and to become the Speaker. This concludes
      the process of Speaker Transition.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1581/3 (Power=1)
Quarterly Speaker Change

      A Speaker Transition occurs upon the commencement of each
      new quarter.

----------------------------------------------------------------------



======================================================================
Subordinate Legal Codes
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1588/0 (Power=1)
Subordinate Legal Codes

      A Subordinate Legal Code (SLC) is a body of law organized under
      the Rules.  A body of law is a SLC only if it is granted that
      status by the Rules and it meets all other requirements in the
      Rules for being a SLC.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1595/0 (Power=1)
Precedence of SLCs

      Unless otherwise specified by the Rules, older SLCs take
      precedence over younger ones.  This ordering is based on the
      time the SLC is first created.

      This Rule does not in any way establish an order of precedence
      for the components, if any, within a given SLC.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1591/0 (Power=1)
Jurisdiction of SLCs

      A SLC has the power to constrain the actions of Players in
      the same manner as the Rules.  However, a SLC has power over
      only those Players within its Jurisdiction, as defined in the
      Rules authorizing that SLC.

      The Jurisdiction of a SLC must be specified by the Rules,
      either directly or indirectly.  If the Jurisdiction of a SLC
      might vary over the course of the existence of the SLC, the
      Rules must specify a Player who is required to maintain a record
      of which Players are within the Jurisdiction of that SLC.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1594/0 (Power=1)
Violation of SLCs

      A Player who is within the Jurisdiction of a SLC is required to
      abide by it while e remains within its Jurisdiction, unless
      doing so would violate either the Rules or another SLC with
      higher precedence.

      A Player who fails to abide by a SLC is in violation of that
      SLC.  A Player who is found by a CFJ to have violated a SLC
      shall suffer whatever penalties specified in the Rules
      authorizing the violated SLC, or, if there is no such penalty
      specified, a default penalty of three Blots, to be reported by
      the Judge of the CFJ.

      There shall be no additional penalty imposed upon a Player who
      violates this Rule by violating a SLC; this Rule takes
      precedence over any Rule which specifies penalties for violating
      Rules.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1457/11 (Power=1)
Judicial Procedure for Violations of an SLC

      When any Player believes that a Subordinate Legal Code (SLC) has
      been violated by a Player within the SLC's Jurisdiction e shall
      inform the Maintainer of that SLC of that belief, along with the
      nature of the violation, the violated text of the SLC, and the
      identity of the violating Player. The Maintainer shall then, as
      soon as possible, distribute this information to all Players
      within the Jurisdiction of the violated SLC.

      If, within 72 hours of this distribution, no Player within the
      SLC's Jurisdiction disputes the claim, the Maintainer shall
      declare the SLC violated.  The Maintainer is then allowed to
      initiate any corrections and penalties allowed by the Rules and
      the violated SLC.

      If any Player under the SLC's Jurisdiction disputes the claim
      of violation within 72 hours, then any Player may submit a Call
      for Judgement, alleging that a specific Player has violated the
      SLC. Such a CFJ cannot be made in any other circumstance.

      All Players within the SLC's Jurisdiction are automatically
      ineligible to Judge such a CFJ.

      Whenever such a CFJ is found TRUE, the SLC has been violated and
      the SLC's Maintainer shall perform the same duties as when no
      Player contests the claim. If such a TRUE Judgement is
      overturned on Appeal, those actions shall be reversed to the
      extent possible immediately upon the resolution of the appeal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1590/2 (Power=1)
Maintainer of SLCs

      For a SLC to be legally authorized, the Rules must specify a
      Player who is required to maintain a record of the content of
      that SLC; this Player is known as the Maintainer of that SLC.

      The Maintainer of a given SLC must provide a copy of it to any
      other Player who requests it, as soon as possible after the
      request is made.  If the SLC has changed between the time of the
      request and the time the Maintainer fulfills the request, the
      Maintainer must provide the SLC as it existed at the time of the
      request and must additionally document every change made to the
      SLC between the time of the request and the time of its
      fulfillment.

      The Maintainer of an SLC must also provide an updated copy of
      the SLC to all Players within its Jurisdiction as soon as
      possible after the SLC changes for any reason.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1589/2 (Power=1)
Modification of SLCs

      A SLC shall not be changed except in accordance with the Rules.
      Notwithstanding any other method which may be defined, a SLC may
      always be changed by the operation of an instrument of Power 1
      or greater.

      A SLC is permitted to define its own mechanisms for changing its
      own content, and any change to a SLC adopted in accordance with
      its own mechanisms is legal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1592/0 (Power=1)
Authority of SLCs to Change Properties

      A SLC has the power to define the manner in which certain
      properties of entities are changed.  This power shall be limited
      to any property solely defined by that SLC and to any other
      property to which the Rules grant that SLC this authority.

----------------------------------------------------------------------



======================================================================
Organizations
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1528/4 (Power=1)
Organizations

      There are entities known as Organizations.  An entity is only an
      Organization when specifically designated as such by the Rules.
      All Organizations consist of the following elements;

        i) An associated SLC.
       ii) A set of Players under the Jurisdiction of the associated
           SLC.
      iii) A Name that is unique to that Organization.

      No Organization exists that is not of a class of Organization
      that is defined in the Rules. The class of an Organization is
      specified when it is formed, and can not change thereafter.  If
      a class of Organization ever becomes undefined in the Rules,
      then all Organizations of that class are immediately dissolved.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1614/2 (Power=1)
Organizations' Names

      The Name of all Organizations shall be unique. No action is
      permitted that would allow either a nameless Organization to
      exist, or an Organization to exist with a Name that duplicates
      that of another Nomic Entity.

      The Name of an Organization shall only be changed as specified
      by its SLC, or as specified in the Rules. If no other procedure
      is specified, the Name of any Organization shall change with the
      unanimous consent of all Players within the Jurisdiction of that
      Organization's SLC.

      This Rule defers to Rules pertaining to a specific class of
      Organization.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1612/1 (Power=1)
Organizations' SLCs

      Unless otherwise specified in an Organization's SLC, that SLC
      can be changed by the unanimous consent of all the Players
      within the SLCs Jurisdiction.

      The Jurisdiction of an Organization's SLC is permitted to vary
      over the period of its existence. The SLC of an Organization
      ceases to exist when the Organization ceases to exist.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1531/6 (Power=1)
Administrators and Their Duties

      The Administrator of an Organization shall be within the
      Jurisdiction of that Organization's SLC, be the Maintainer
      of the Organization's SLC, and be the Executor of that
      Organization.

      The Administrator shall inform the Notary of the following
      changes as soon as possible after they occur, and identify the
      nature of the change;

        i) The Name of the Organization changes.
       ii) The Administrator of the Organization changes.
      iii) The Executor of the Organization changes.
       iv) The Maintainer of the Organization's SLC changes.
        v) The Jurisdiction of the Organization's SLC changes.
       vi) The Organization undergoes a Voluntary Dissolution.

      The Administrator also shall be the Player required to maintain
      a record of the Players within the Jurisdiction of the
      Organization's SLC.

      This Rule shall defer to the Rules governing specific classes of
      Organizations if they specify differently.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1547/4 (Power=1)
Some Organizations Can Vote

      If an Organization is a Voting Entity then it is permitted to
      cast votes on Proposals as if it were a Player. Such votes are
      cast by the Organization's Executor, acting on behalf of the
      Organization.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1759/1 (Power=1)
Organizational Payment Orders

      The Executor of an Organization's SLC is empowered to execute
      Payment Orders from the Organization or from any Player within
      its Jurisdiction, but only such Payment Orders as are authorized
      by the SLC.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1533/10 (Power=1)
Application to Create an Organization

      There is a type of Application called an Application to Create
      an Organization (ACO).  A valid ACO, in order to have effect
      upon Execution, must include the following:

        i) A defined class for the prospective Organization.
       ii) A unique Name for the prospective Organization.
      iii) An SLC for the prospective Organization.
       iv) All additional information required by the Rules governing
           the class of the prospective Organization.
        v) The signatures of at least as many distinct Players as
           required by the Rules governing the class of the
           prospective Organization, (minimum one) all of whom must be
           eligible to be members of the prospective Organization.

      A valid ACO is Executed by submitting it to the Notary or by
      sending it to the Public Forum.

      The effect of Executing a valid ACO is to create the prospective
      Organization, with the signatories as its Foundors.  The
      Foundors then come under the Jurisdiction of that Organization's
      SLC.

      An ACO shall only be valid if its contents are not in conflict
      with this or other Rules.  An ACO that is not valid shall never
      be Executed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1397/5 (Power=1)
Dissolution of Organizations

      An Organization shall only be dissolved when the Rules or the
      Organization's SLC require it.  An Organization shall be
      required to be dissolved whenever any of the following
      conditions are true:

        i) The Jurisdiction of its SLC becomes empty, and there is no
           provision for this to change.
       ii) The continued existence of the Organization would require
           that the Organization have no legal Administrator.
      iii) The continued existence of the Organization would require
           that the Organization have no legal Executor.
       iv) The continued existence of the Organization would require
           that the Organization have no legal Maintainer for its SLC.
        v) The SLC of the Organization requires the Organization to
           dissolve.  This is a Voluntary Dissolution, all other
           dissolutions are Administrative Dissolutions.

      The Notary is required to detect when an Administrative
      Dissolution takes place.

      As soon as possible after an Organization dissolves, for any
      reason, the Notary shall report that dissolution to the Public
      Forum.

      All Organizations cease to exist upon dissolution. Other Rules
      can require an Organization to dissolve under other
      circumstances.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1617/1 (Power=1)
Changing the Jurisdiction of an Organization's SLC

      The Jurisdiction of an Organization's SLC shall only be changed
      in accordance with that SLC and with the Rules.  If there are no
      provisions for changing such an SLC, then the SLC can not be
      changed.

      No Player shall ever be made part of the Jurisdiction of the SLC
      of any Organization without eir consent.  This takes precedence
      over any Rule that would permit a Player to be involuntarily
      made part of the Jurisdiction of such a SLC.

----------------------------------------------------------------------



======================================================================
Groups and Contests
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 766/9 (Power=1)
Groups

      There is a class of Organization known collectively as the class
      of Groups.  Each single Organization within this class is a
      Group.  Each Group has associated with it an SLC called its
      Ordinances.  A Group's Administrator is that Group's
      Ordinancekeepor.  A Group's Executor is that Group's Vizier. The
      set of Players within the Jurisdiction of that Group's SLC is
      that Group's Membership.

      A Group's Membership is permitted to contain any Player who is
      not a Member of any other Group.

      A Group must have at least three Foundors, who constitute the
      Group's initial Membership.  Both the Ordinancekeepor and the
      Vizier of a Group must, at all times, be Members of the Group.

      Each Group has Mint Authority.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 716/6 (Power=1)
How to Form a Group

      An ACO that attempts to form a Group must contain, in addition
      to any information required elsewhere, a specification of the
      prospective initial Ordinancekeepor and Vizier of the Group to
      be created.  Further, an Application to Create a Group is
      invalid, and has no effect if Executed, if any of its
      signatories is a Member of another Group at the time of its
      Execution.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 719/2 (Power=1)
Joining a Group

      A Player shall be added to the Membership of a Group only when:

      a) the Player to be added is not already a Member of another
         Group;
      b) the Player to be added has sent the Vizier of the Group in
         question a message requesting to be added to the Membership
         of that Group; and
      c) the addition of that Player to that Group's Membership is
         otherwise permitted by that Group's Ordinances and the Rules.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 721/9 (Power=1)
The Vizier and the Ordinancekeepor

      The Vizier of a Group shall be whoever the Ordinances of that
      Group specify. If the Ordinances are silent, the Vizier shall be
      the Player who authored the ACO that created that Group, if e is
      still a Member of that Group.  If the Group was not created by
      the Execution of an ACO, the Vizier shall be whoever was the
      Vizier of that Group when it was first created.

      If the Vizier thus specified is not a Member of the Group, the
      Group shall be dissolved.

      Unless the Ordinances of a Group specify otherwise, the
      Ordinancekeepor of a Group shall be its Vizier.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1752/1 (Power=1)
Group Votes

      If a given Group is a Voting Entity, then it shall be entitled
      to cast Vote(s) only as specified by its Ordinances.  If the
      Ordinances of the Group do not specify how the Group shall cast
      its Vote(s), it may not do so.

      A Group is not entitled to cast Votes on a Proposal if it did
      not exist at the beginning of the Voting Period of that
      Proposal.

      A Group with fewer than three Members is not entitled to cast
      Votes.

      The Vizier of a Group is responsible for communicating the
      Group's Votes to the Assessor.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 718/5 (Power=1)
Resignation from a Group

      A Player who is a Member of a Group shall be removed from the
      Jurisdiction of that Group's Ordinances when that Player sends a
      message to the Notary and the Vizier of that Group, indicating
      that e is resigning from that Group.  The Ordinances of a Group
      are not permitted to prohibit a Player from sending such a
      message.

      This Rule does not in any way prevent a Player from being
      removed from the Jurisdiction of a Group's Ordinances by other
      means specified by the Rules or the Ordinances of that Group.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1446/11 (Power=1)
Contests

      There is a class of Organization known collectively as the class
      of Contests.  Each single Organization within this class is a
      Contest.  The SLC associated with a Contest are that Contest's
      Regulations.  A Contest's Administrator is that Contest's
      Contestmaster.  A Contest's Contestants are those Players within
      the Jurisdiction of that Group's SLC, other than the
      Contestmaster.

      Any Player is permitted to be a Contestant or a Contestmaster of
      any Contest, unless that would conflict with that Contest's
      Regulations, or the Rules. A Contest must have exactly one
      Foundor, who becomes the Contest's initial Contestmaster.

      The ACO to create a Contest must be Posted to the Public Forum
      to have effect.

      Each Contest has Mint Authority.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1539/1 (Power=1)
Regulations and Membership of Contests

      No Player within Jurisdiction of a Contest's Regulations is
      bound to obey any Regulation or combination of Regulations that
      conflict with the Rules.

      The Regulations can specify the following:

        i) How a Contestmaster is replaced. No person may become
           Contestmaster without eir consent.  If left unspecified,
           the Contestmaster cannot change while the Contest exists.
       ii) How the Currencies in the Contest Fund shall be spent.  If
           this is not specified, they may only be spent when the
           Rules require it.
      iii) The amount of the Entry Fee for the Contest, in the form of
           units of any specific Currency.
       iv) Additional restrictions on Players to become Contestants,
           and conditions under which Contestants cease to be
           Contestants.

      A Player becomes a Contestant by notifying the Contestmaster and
      paying the prescribed Entry Fee to the Contest Fund.  A
      Contestant may quit a Contest at any time by so notifying the
      Contestmaster.  A Contestmaster may resign at any time by
      posting a message to that effect to the Public Forum, at which
      time e ceases to be Contestmaster.

Honour
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1062/1 (Power=1)
Kudos and Honour

      Let there be an Entity called the Kudo (plural: Kudos). The
      amount of Kudos a Player holds is called eir Honour. All Players
      possess at all times an integral number of Kudos not less than
      0.

      A new Player, or a Player with no Kudo record starts with 20
      Kudos. If a Player is deregistered but returns within three
      months, e starts with the same number of Kudos e had when e
      left. If e returns after a longer time than three months, e is
      treated as a new Player with respect to Kudos.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1377/6 (Power=1)
The Herald

      There is an Office of Herald.

      The Herald's Report includes the following:

      - The Honour of every Entity that has been a Player at any
        time within the last three months, and the changes thereof
        since the last posting of the Herald's Report.

      - The reason for each such change; in the case of a
        Player-initiated change this includes any justification
        provided by the Player.

      - The Currency Records for Indulgences.

      - A list of all Fugitives from Justice, and the number of
        Fugitive Blots attributed to each such Fugitive.

      The Herald shall receive a salary equal to 2 times
      the Basic Officer Salary.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1378/3 (Power=1)
Kudo Transfers

      A single Kudo shall be transferred from one Player (the
      "Victim") to a second Player (the "Beneficiary") when a Player
      (the "Transferer") sends a message to the Herald indicating that
      e is transferring a Kudo from the Victim to the Beneficiary, and
      all the following conditions hold:

      a) the Transferer has not, during the current Nomic Week,
         previously caused two or more Kudo transfers;
      b) the Transferer is not the same Player as the Beneficiary;
      c) The Transferer has not, during the current Nomic Week,
         previously transferred a Kudo away from the Victim or to the
         Beneficiary;
      d) the Victim has at least one Kudo; and
      e) the message contains a justification for the transfer.

      This Rule does not in any way prohibit other Rules from causing
      changes to a Player's Honour.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1872/0 (Power=1)
Herald's Privilege

      No more than once a month, the Herald may increase the honour
      of a Player, other than emself, by announcing in the Public
      Forum the identity of that Player and the reason for the
      increase.  At the same time as e makes this announcement, the
      Herald shall record an increase of one Kudo in the holdings of
      said Player.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1008/4 (Power=1)
The Shogun

      Let there exist the Patent Title of "Shogun".

      Whenever a Player is a Samurai, that Player has at least as
      much Honor as every other Player, and that Player does not
      already hold the Patent Title of Shogun, that Player is
      automatically awarded the Patent Title of Shogun.

      The Patent Title of Shogun is revoked automatically from any
      Player who holds it if e ceases to be a Samurai.

      A Samurai is a Player whose Honor is more than 30 Kudos.

      This Patent Title shall not be awarded or revoked except as
      specified in this Rule; this Rule takes precedence over any Rule
      which would permit otherwise.

      The Herald shall announce in the Public Forum whenever a Player
      receives or loses this Title, as soon as possible after such
      award or revocation occurs.

  Judgement published:                     as of this message

==========================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

I use the term "3830" to denote the Proposal G. Chaos tried to
distribute with Proposals 3831 and 3832 in his message of 7 Feb., which
he marked with the designation 3830, entitled "The Grand Agoran
Tournament". This message fit all the requirements for distribution,
except that of having been given an official number as required by 109.
However, by 1770, such omission does not affect the legality of the
Proposal's distribution. Therefore, Proposal "3830" was distributed, but
without a number as required by 109 (I will hereafter refer to this as
the "109 number".

Now, the second issue, is whether "3830" does currently have a 109
number, namely, 3833. G. Chaos is correct that an Officer does not have
to issue a COE to correct his own report; by CFJ 919 any correction is
to be considered a COE and a response. The question is, has G. Chaos
issued such a correction? No. He proceeded to redistribute Proposal
"3830" a second time, giving this second issue the number of 3833.
Nowhere in the redistribution did he indicate that this was a correction
of his previous message. Can we consider this an implicit corection? No.
The correction required was the assignment of a 109 number to the
already distributed Proposal "3830". However, G. Chaos' messages to the
PF indicate that he felt "3830" had in fact not been distributed at all,
and that 3833 was a seperate distribution. In fact, now we know that it
was the second distribution of the Proposal. So the correction, viz. the
assignment of a 109 number to "3830", has never occurred.

I also request the Judge issue an Order to Compel to General Chaos
requiring him to assign Proposal "3830" a number as required by Rule
109.

==========================================================================
Judge's Arguments:

I judge FALSE.  I find that the Proposal was indeed distributed as the
Statement suggests, but at the time the CFJ was called it had been given
a number, namely 3833.

This judgement is based on the following findings, some of which relate
to Caller's argument.

1. The Promotor attempted to distribute Vlad's proposal "The Grand
Agoran Tournament" at two separate times on 08 Feb 1999 (GMT), namely at
01:22:57 GMT ("OFF: Proposals 3830-3832") and at 02:03:24 GMT ("OFF:
Proposal 3833")

Note that this does not mean that there are two Proposals; under 1483
there was no creation of any new Proposal with the same text.

2. At the time of the first message, the Promotor attempted to give the
number 3830 to the Proposal, but this number had already been used
before, and the attempted assignment failed as contrary to Rule 109.

By Rule 1770, the "legal effects" of distribution took place anyway.
These include the start of the Voting Period on the unnumbered Proposal
(Rule 693) and its removal from the Proposal Queue (Rule 1770).

3. Even though the Promotor failed to follow Rule 109 at the time of
distribution, this does not deprive a later assignment of a number to
the unnumbered Proposal from having effect.

Game Custom and (I believe) earlier Judgements have held that a Rule
which prescribes a Player action "at" a particular time does not thereby
prevent an omitted action from being performed at a later time (though
other Rules may explicitly prevent it). Indeed, the Caller is assuming
this in eir request for an order to compel such an action.

4. The caller argues that the Promotor did not give the number 3833 to
the Proposal, but to the "second issue" of the Proposal. This is wrong:
numbers are given to Proposals, not to 'issues' of Proposals. As noted,
there are not two Proposals under discussion but only one.

5. The second message gives evidence that sometime after 01:22:57 GMT
and no later than 02:03:24 GMT, the Promotor attempted to give number
3833 to the Proposal. The Promotor's mistaken belief about the status of
the Proposal does not affect the assignment of the number.

6. Rule 109 requires the number to be the least integer greater than the
numbers previously assigned.  After the first message, 3831 and 3832 had
already been assigned. So 3833 is the correct number, and the attempt to
give it to the Proposal was successful.

DICTUM: With regards to Vlad's vote:  reasonable (if slightly
inattentive) people could be confused about which Proposal was meant by
"Proposal 3830" in the context in which Vlad attempted to vote. Thus I
could support a judgement that Vlad's attempt to vote was ambiguous.

elJefe, J.

Text of Rule 109:
Rule 109/3 (Power=2)
Proposal Numbers

      At the time e distributes it, the Promotor shall give each
      Proposal a Number for reference.  The Number of a Proposal shall
      be the least integer greater than all other Numbers previously
      assigned to a Proposal (including numbers assigned to Proposals
      later determined to have been incorrectly submitted), or 301,
      whichever is greater.

@@@@@@@

Text of Rule 1770:
Rule 1770/2 (Power=1)
Distributing Proposals

      Each week, the Promotor shall distribute a batch of Proposals.
      These are the only Proposals e is allowed to distribute that
      week.

      If the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue with a
      Priority greater than zero is less than or equal to the Batch
      Size, then the batch shall consist of all such Proposals.

      If the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue is greater
      than the Batch Size, then the batch shall consist of those
      Proposals in the Queue with the highest Priority such that the
      number of Proposals distributed is equal to the Batch Size.

      Once a Proposal is distributed, it is removed from the Proposal
      Queue.

      The Promotor shall distribute each proposal in the batch to the
      Public Forum, accompanied by its Number and the identity of
      its Proposing Entity.

G. Chaos' explanation of his reissue of my Proposal:

Subject: BUS: Oops, again

Upon reviewing the Rules, it appears to me to appear that Vlad's
Proposal has not yet been distributed, and the other two have.
While the Rules require that I distribute only the Proposals in the
Batch, it does not say that I have to distribute them all at one
time.  Therefore, I will distribute Vlad's Proposal separately as
Proposal 3833 in a few minutes.  My apologies for the confusion.

(It also says that I don't have to distribute the Proposals in the
batch in any particular order.  Hm.)

  Judgement published:                     as of this message

==========================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

R910 states "The Justiciar does not receive a fixed weekly salary."
R1007 states "Unless otherwise specified, the Salary for an Office
              shall be equal to the Basic Salary."

I contend that the above statement in R910 constitutes a specification
of the salary for the Justiciar.  Because the (lack of) salary is
specified in R910, the above statement in R1007 prevents it from setting
the salary of the Justiciar to the Basic Salary.  I should remind the
Judge that if e were to find this CFJ TRUE, e must then vacate the
referenced Payment Order.

==========================================================================
Judge's Arguments:

I Judge the statement FALSE.  "X does not exist" is not equivalent to "X
is zero".  For a concrete example, consider these hypothetical Rules:

     Rule 3000A
     The Justiciar's Salary is zero VTs.

     Rule 3000B
     The Justiciar's Salary is one VT.

Clearly 3000A and 3000B conflict.  But the relevant clause of 910/6 does
not conflict with 3000B, so it cannot be equivalent to 3000A.

==========================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

By "3833" I mean the Proposal G. Chaos tried to distribute
by itself in his message of 7 Feb., entitled "The Grand Agoran
Tournament" and given the designation 3833. As another CFJ made by
me will determine, Proposal "3833" was in fact distributed earlier,
although at the time of this CFJ it has not been given an official
number. The distribution of "3833" was illegal because at the time
G. Chaos attempted to distribute it, there was no such Proposal in
the queue (it having already been distributed), and a number of
Proposals equal to the batch size had already been distributed
(namely the aforementioned unnumbered Proposal, 3831 and 3832.).
Therefore, G. Chaos had no authority to make such a distribution.

==========================================================================
Judge's Arguments:

As elJefe has made clear in his judgement of CFJ1121, there was only
ever one proposal.  In his statement, Vlad refers to it as Proposal
"3833".  This proposal is the same proposal that was on the queue, and
this is also the proposal that was distributed by General Chaos on
Monday (GMT) in the message with ID:
<199902080122.UAA20666@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

This proposal wasn't distributed with a proper number initially, only
gaining one when General Chaos's second post was made, but this
retrospective correction, did not deny the original distribution of
legal effect.  Hence the proposal that Vlad refers to was properly
distributed, and is up for vote.

Therefore I enter a judgement of FALSE.

==========================================================================
Documentation attached by Caller:

Text of Rule 1770:
Rule 1770/2 (Power=1)
Distributing Proposals

      Each week, the Promotor shall distribute a batch of Proposals.
      These are the only Proposals e is allowed to distribute that
      week.

      If the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue with a
      Priority greater than zero is less than or equal to the Batch
      Size, then the batch shall consist of all such Proposals.

      If the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue is greater
      than the Batch Size, then the batch shall consist of those
      Proposals in the Queue with the highest Priority such that the
      number of Proposals distributed is equal to the Batch Size.

      Once a Proposal is distributed, it is removed from the Proposal
      Queue.

      The Promotor shall distribute each proposal in the batch to the
      Public Forum, accompanied by its Number and the identity of
      its Proposing Entity.

      The failure of the Promotor to distribute any of the above
      accompaniments with a Proposal does not deprive the
      distribution of the Proposal of any legal effect.

      A Proposal is only considered to be legally distributed if it
      is explicitly marked as such. The Promotor is permitted to
      publish the text of undistributed Proposals without necessarily
      distributing them.

Caller's Arguments:

At 20:22:57 EST on 2/7, I (as Promotor) erroneously attempted to
distribute a Proposal called 'The Grand Agoran Tournament' as Proposal
3830.  Since that number had already been used for another Proposal,
such distribution was invalid.  I discovered and announced my error at
20:51:49 EST, about a half-hour later, and distributed the same
Proposal as Proposal 3833 at 21:03:24 EST.

Vlad was aware of my error at as of 00:06:13 EST on 2/8, because he
claimed that the redistribution was in error.  Notwithstanding his
awareness of an error, he proceeded to cast eir votes at 00:11:01 EST.
It seems obvious that Vlad was aware, or should have been aware, that
there was an irregularity in the distribution.

In any case, at the time Vlad cast his votes, there were two Proposals
which a reasonable person might understand to be "Proposal 3830",
although legally only Blob's "Actions with N Supporters" Proposal
bears that number.  Vlad's reference to Proposal 3830 in his Votring
message was therefore ambiguous; hence, his message fails to
successfully communicate to the Assessor which Proposal e is
attempting to cast Votes upon.  Assessor Blob erred in counting these
Votes.

Since the miscounting of Vlad's Votes does not affect the outcome of
Proposal 3830, the only corrective action require is to vacate Payment
Orders avt083 and avt085, and I hereby move the Judge to do so.

Respectfully submitted,

General Chaos
