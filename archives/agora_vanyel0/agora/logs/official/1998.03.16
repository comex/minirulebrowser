Amend R1047 by replacing the sentence

      When an Interested Proposal Proposed by some Player is adopted
      with no votes cast AGAINST it, that Player is awarded the Patent
      Title of Zeitgeist.

with 

      When an Interested Proposal Proposed by some Player is adopted
      with no votes cast AGAINST it, and at least three different
      voting entities voted for it, that Player is awarded the Patent
      Title of Zeitgeist.

Proposal  (Swann) AI = 1
A minor Score Fix

Rule 1783 is amended by replacing the text;
", and specifying the magnitude of that change."

with the text;
", the magnitude of the change, and whether that change is
 a gain or a loss."

{Comment: Fixes the bug which allows a Score change to be ordered
          by saying a Player's Score changes by X points, w/o saying
          if X is positive or negative.}

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Chuck) AI = 1  (Sane)
CounterScam the Veto Scam, Part I

I request that this Proposal have AI=1.
This Proposal is Sane.

A Rule shall be created with the following text:

      Upon creation of this Rule, the Voting Index of the Proposal
      entitled "CounterScam the Veto Scam, Part II" shall be set to 6.
      Immediately following that, the Proposal entitled "CounterScam
      the Veto Scam, Part II" shall take effect; that is, the
      provisions contained in the text of that Proposal shall be
      implemented to the maximal extent permitted by the Rules.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would prevent
      "CounterScam the Veto Scam, Part II" from having effect at
      the time required by this Rule, or from having effect at all.

      All references to "CounterScam the Veto Scam, Part II" in
      this Rule shall be taken to refer to the Proposal of that
      Title which was Proposed by the same Player as the Proposal
      which created this Rule.  If there is more than one such
      Proposal, then the first and second paragraphs of this
      Rule are without effect.

      This Rule shall repeal itself at 12:00 GMT on 15 April 1998.

[Comment: Although this has a certain similarity to the recent
situation regarding impeachments, it was conceived of before
the impeachment situation was brought to light.
Part II will be proposed once Part I has been distributed.]

    Antimatter transfers one Kudo FROM Swann TO Steve.

    I transfer one Kudo
	FROM Swann, for shamelessly exploiting a loophole in a rule he 
        wrote, rather than honorably fixing his error in a less dramatic 
        fashion,
      TO Steve, for discovering the problem with the Impeachment rules, 
        and also as compensation for the aggravation I've doubtless been 
        putting him through.

    Chancellor G. Chaos pays of POI765, POI766, and POI767.

    Steve transfers a Kudo FROM Steve TO Swann.

    I hereby transfer a Kudo

    FROM myself, because I don't deserve the Kudo Antimatter transferred
         to me for the reasons given above,

    TO   Swann, because he has nothing to be ashamed of. We the voters
         are collectively responsible for the Proposals we vote to adopt.

Date: Tue, 10 Mar 1998 18:14:44 +0000

    Antimatter transfers a Kudo FROM Antimatter TO G. Chaos

    I transfer one Kudo FROM myself, because I made the mistake, TO 
    Scott, for finding the Impeachment bug.

Date: Wed, 11 Mar 1998 13:10:13 +1000

    Jester transfer one Kudo FROM G. Chaos TO Chuck.

    For your sound reply to this COE I hereby transfer one Kudo to you. This
    Kudo will come from G.Chaos for eir unwillingness to accept that another
    individual may apply logical thought processes in a different manner to
    emself.

The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of
a VOC directive was the report published in the PF on 1996/08/13
(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

AFAIK, no Herald's Report has ever been successfully ratified.

Proposal 3716 (Chuck)  AI = 1  (Sane)
CounterScam the Veto Scam, Part I

A Rule shall be created with the following text:

      Upon creation of this Rule, the Voting Index of the Proposal
      entitled "CounterScam the Veto Scam, Part II" shall be set to 6.
      Immediately following that, the Proposal entitled "CounterScam
      the Veto Scam, Part II" shall take effect; that is, the
      provisions contained in the text of that Proposal shall be
      implemented to the maximal extent permitted by the Rules.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would prevent
      "CounterScam the Veto Scam, Part II" from having effect at
      the time required by this Rule, or from having effect at all.

      All references to "CounterScam the Veto Scam, Part II" in
      this Rule shall be taken to refer to the Proposal of that
      Title which was Proposed by the same Player as the Proposal
      which created this Rule.  If there is more than one such
      Proposal, then the first and second paragraphs of this
      Rule are without effect.

      This Rule shall repeal itself at 12:00 GMT on 15 April 1998.

[Comment: Although this has a certain similarity to the recent
situation regarding impeachments, it was conceived of before
the impeachment situation was brought to light.
Part II will be proposed once Part I has been distributed.]
