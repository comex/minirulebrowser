 InterNomic Rules 

THE RULES OF INTERNOMIC
As of Thursday, December 11, 1997

Rule 101/0 (Immutable)

 All member nomics must always abide by all Internomic rules then
      in effect, in the form in which they are then in effect.  At the
      start of the first game, rules 101-114 are immutable, and rules
      201-216 are mutable.  Subsequently, the number of a rule does not
      indicate that rule's mutability.

 Initial Immutable Rule 101, Aug 01 1996

Rule 102/0 (Immutable)

 A nomic is a game in which the rules are changeable by those who
      play it.  The entities which play this nomic, aka "Internomic",
      are themselves nomics, aka "member nomics".  Every member nomic
      shall be either a voting member or a nonvoting member.  References
      in this ruleset to "nomics" or "members" shall mean member nomics,
      and shall include both voting and nonvoting members, unless
      otherwise noted.  References in the ruleset to "rules" shall mean
      Internomic rules, unless otherwise noted.

 Initial Immutable Rule 102, Aug 01 1996

Rule 103/0 (Immutable)

  At any time, there shall be exactly one moderator, who must be a
      player of at least one member nomic.  The moderator may not
      resign.  If the moderator is no longer a player in any member
      nomic, e must name a successor who is.  Once this is done, the
      successor replaces the moderator.

 Initial Immutable Rule 103, Aug 01 1996

Rule 104/0 (Immutable)

 The moderator for the first game shall be Andre.

 Initial Immutable Rule 104, Aug 01 1996

Rule 105/0 (Immutable)

 Every member nomic shall have a liaison at all times.  The liaison
      must be an entity registered as a player of that nomic.

 Initial Immutable Rule 105, Aug 01 1996

Rule 106/0 (Immutable)

 A rule change is the enactment, repeal, or amendment of a mutable
      rule, or the transmutation of an immutable rule into a mutable
      rule or vice versa.

 Initial Immutable Rule 106, Aug 01 1996

Rule 107/0 (Immutable)

 Every proposal shall be numbered by the moderator.  The numbers
      shall begin with 301, and each proposal shall receive the next
      successive integer.

 Initial Immutable Rule 107, Aug 01 1996

Rule 108/0 (Immutable)

   Every proposal shall be communicated to all voting members before
      it is voted on.  If adopted, it shall take effect in the form in
      which it was voted on.

 Initial Immutable Rule 108, Aug 01 1996

Rule 109/0 (Immutable)

  All proposals shall be voted on.  They will be adopted if and only if
      they receive the required number of votes.

 Initial Immutable Rule 109, Aug 01 1996

Rule 110/0 (Immutable)

  A proposal containing a transmutation rule change is adopted if
      and only if all votes on that proposal are in favor.
      Transmutation may not be implied, but must be stated explicitly.

 Initial Immutable Rule 110, Aug 01 1996

Rule 111/0 (Immutable)

 An immutable rule always takes precedence over a mutable rule.  If
      there is a conflict between the two, the mutable rule is entirely
      void.

 Initial Immutable Rule 111, Aug 01 1996

Rule 112/0 (Immutable)

  A member nomic may always withdraw from Internomic.

 Initial Immutable Rule 112, Aug 01 1996

Rule 113/0 (Immutable)

   It must never become completely impermissible to change rules.

 Initial Immutable Rule 113, Aug 01 1996

Rule 114/0 (Immutable)

   Whatever is not forbidden is allowed, except that changing the
      rules is only permitted when another rule allows it.

 Initial Immutable Rule 114, Aug 01 1996

<!mutable rules>

Rule 201/0 (Mutable)

  All members begin with 0 points.

 Initial Mutable Rule 201, Aug 01 1996

Rule 202/1 (Mutable)

 The game ends when a nomic achieves 100 points.  The winner is the
      first nomic to do so.  The liaison from that nomic becomes
      moderator, and all scores are reset to 0.  A new game is then
      begun, with all rules and proposals retaining the status they had
      at the end of the game.

 Initial Mutable Rule 202, Aug 01 1996
 Amended by Proposal 313, Nov 28, 1996, by Ackanomic

Rule 203/0 (Mutable)

  A proposal is made by submitting it to the moderator.  All members
      may make proposals.  Upon receiving the proposal, the moderator

      shall assign it a number and distribute it to all nomics.

 Initial Mutable Rule 203, Aug 01 1996

Rule 204/1 (Mutable)

Every proposal shall contain one or more rule changes.

 Initial Mutable Rule 204, Aug 01 1996
 Amended by Proposal 312b, Nov 13, 1996, by Agora

Rule 206/0 (Mutable)

  Each voting member may vote exactly once per proposal.  Nonvoting
      members may not vote.

 Initial Mutable Rule 206, Aug 01 1996

Rule 207/0 (Mutable)

 Voting members may vote either for or against any proposal by
      sending their vote to the moderator by the end of the voting period
      on that proposal.  The moderator may not reveal any votes until the
      end of the voting period.  Any voting member who does not vote has
      abstained.

 Initial Mutable Rule 207, Aug 01 1996

Rule 208/0 (Mutable)

   At the end of the voting period of a proposal, the moderator shall
      reveal all votes legally cast on that proposal.  If required, the
      moderator should indicate eir consent (or lack thereof) at this
      time.  If the moderator does not indicate eir opinion, it shall be
      assumed that e consents.

 Initial Mutable Rule 208, Aug 01 1996

Rule 209/1 (Mutable)

A proposal passes if and only if 80% or more of the votes cast on it are in
favor.

 Initial Mutable Rule 209, Aug 01 1996
 Amended by Proposal 330, Apr 19, 1997, by Ackanomic

Rule 211/0 (Mutable)

   If two or more rules conflict, the rule with the lower number
      takes precedence.

 Initial Mutable Rule 211, Aug 01 1996

Rule 212/1 (Mutable)

Any nomic may submit a statement for judgement to the moderator. Upon
receipt of such a statement, the moderator must randomly select a member,
other than the member who submitted it, to judge the statement. The
moderator must then distribute the statement and the identity of the judge
to all member nomics.

 Initial Mutable Rule 212, Aug 01 1996
 Amended by Proposal 322, Feb 14, 1997, by Ackanomic

Rule 213/0 (Mutable)

   A nomic which has been selected to judge must deliver judgement
      within two weeks by sending its judgement to the moderator, who
      must then distribute the judgement to all members.  A legal
      judgement is either "true" or "false", and must be in accordance
      with the rules.

 Initial Mutable Rule 213, Aug 01 1996

Rule 214/0 (Mutable)

   All business to be conducted with a member nomic shall be
      conducted with the liaison to that nomic.  No entity may be
      liaison to more than one member nomic.

Rule 309/1 (Mutable)

 Amended by Proposal 309, Nov 01, 1996, by Ackanomic

Rule 311/1 (Mutable)

A rule change takes effect at the moment the proposal containing it is
adopted. If the rule change is a rule creation, the rule created gets a
rulenumber equal to the lowest integer equal to or higher than the number
of the proposal that is not the number of an existing rule. For the
purpose of this rule, different rule changes in one proposal are regarded
to take place subsequently in the order in which they are given in the
proposal.

 Amended by Proposal 311b, Nov 13, 1996, by Agora

Rule 319/0 (Mutable)

A nomic that is not a member may become a non-voting member. This is done
by its liaison sending a message to the moderator clearly indicating such.
The moderator must announce such a change of membership.

 Created by Proposal 319, by Agora, Jan 20 1997

Rule 323/0 (Mutable)

It is forbidden to alter the essentials of the game state except as is
explicitly or implicitly permitted by a rule or a set of rules. The
essentials of the game state consist of the rules themselves, the scores of
the member nomics, the proposals, the votes cast on proposals, the
statements for judgement and verdicts returned upon them, and anything else
so designated by some rule. No other things are included in the essentials
of the game state.

 Created by Proposal 323, by Thring, Feb 14 1997

Rule 332/0 (Mutable)

InterNomic's Liaison to InterNomic is InterNomic.

 Created by Proposal 332, by Ackanomic, May 21 1997

Rule 335/0 (Mutable)

All member nomics are initially Neutral to one another. Any member nomic
may declare any other member nomic to be an Ally, Neutral or Enemy at any
time by having their liaison publicly announce the change on the
Internomic mailing list. This shall be known as the Attitude of the first
nomic to the second. These three Attitudes are mutually exclusive and not
necessarily reciprocal.

 Created by Proposal 335, by Thring, Jun 09 1997

Rule 347/0 (Mutable)

InterNomic will try to vote on every proposal 96 hours before the
end of the voting period of the proposal. 

InterNomic's vote will be determined at the time InterNomic tries to
vote, according to the following rules:

i) If at the time InterNomic tries to vote more voting members of
Internomic have voted for the proposal than against it, InterNomic
will vote for the proposal.

ii) If at the time InterNomic tries to vote more voting members of
Internomic have voted against the proposal than for it, InterNomic
will vote against the proposal.

iii) If neither i) nor ii) applies, InterNomic will not vote on the
proposal.

This vote from InterNomic is automatic. Its outcome shall be
determined by the moderator. This vote is a valid vote.

The last two paragraphs of this rule take precedence over any other
rule concerning the validity of a vote.

 Created by Proposal 347, by Agora, Sep 24 1997

Rule 348/0 (Mutable)

The liaison of a nomic can only be changed by that nomic, and such a change
is not effective until notice of it has been sent to the the internomic
mailing list. The moderator can only be changed as specified in the Rules.

 Created by Proposal 348, by Agora, Oct 02 1997

Rule 349/1 (Mutable)

The liaison
of any member nomic can send a message to the mailing list,
claiming that the moderator is not present. If the moderator does not send
any message to the mailing list during the complete period of fourteen
days starting at the time of this message, the liaison of the nomic
who claimed that the moderator was not present becomes moderator
automatically.
