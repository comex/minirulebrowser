  Assigned to favor Tue, 1 Aug 95 02:30:17 CDT
  Declined by favor Tue, 1 Aug 95 11:23:23 EDT
  Assigned to Vanyel {as of this message}

============================================================

Arguments of Caller (elJefe):

For one thing, there is no allegation in the Statement against a
particular Player.

Nor is there evidence in the record that the Vizier committed an
illegal act.  "Performing the dissolution" is meaningless.  The Ordinance
says that the group dissolves upon receiving the consent of the members.
So are you looking for the person/persons giving consent?  And where is
the evidence that the Vizier actually gave consent?

============================================================

End of CFJ 799

I like the idea of public ordinances, but like Dave B, I'm a bit leery
of having to automatically publish them to the mailing list.  My
suggestion is that the proposal require them to be published on Group
creation, and that they henceforth be available to all that request
them.  Basically this would then echo our own Ordinances.

As for the Correlation Matrices.  KoJen the following bit of perl does
a transverse operation on text:

# -*- perl -*- 
while (<>) {
    chop;
    @cols = split(//);
    if (@cols > $maxlength) {
	foreach $i ($maxlength..(@cols-1)) {
	    $rows[$i] .= (' ' x $numlines);
	}
	$maxlength = @cols;
    }
    if (@cols < $maxlength) {
	foreach $i (@cols..($maxlength-1)) { 
	    $cols[$i] = ' ';
	}
    }
    for ($i = 0; $i < @cols; $i++) {
	$rows[$i] .= $cols[$i];
    }
    $numlines++;
}

foreach $row (@rows) { print $row, "\n"; }
# perl ends

Vanyel,

   While I generally like your idea of subpoenas, I think there ought to be
some restrictions on when a judge is allowed to issue one.  For example, the
judge must show some relevance between the matter he is judging and the item
being subpoenaed.  Relevance may be a bit hard to legislate, so perhaps subpoena
requests should be handled by another court.  My concern is that I nothing in
your proposal which would prevent a judge from subpoenaing every secret document
in existence.  Even though the judge can not reveal the contents of these
documents, e might be able to use the information in his own play.

Dave B

Kelly couldn't pull it off, because there are only 17 Players, some of
which are not Active; with the six of us double-voting, plus various
other people who disagree with em, we could stop such a thing.  We can
always buy off Michael's vote, too. :)  It might be a good idea to
disallow this type of Proposal, however...

Hm.  No, I don't think that's necessarily true.  The Ordinances can be
entirely different from the Regulations; the Regulations can refer to
the Ordinances, and vice versa, but they needn't be the same.  Also,
once the Group is formed, all but one Player can drop out of it...
on the other hand, a better idea would be to modify the Group Rules
before Agora-as-a-whole gets wind of our Recursa Group idea.

> I see this as a potentially *very* interesting possibility, and I would like
> to hear other's ideas on how it could be implimented.

Like this:
Recursa Group is formed.  In the Ordinances are stated that the
   Ordinances may be changed only as specified in the Recursa Contest
   Regulations.
Regulation is passed, affiliating the Group and the Contest; in the
   Regulation, a new type of Proposal is created to modify the
   *Ordinances*.
Regulation is passed, requiring Recursa Contestants to join the Recursa
   Group within one week of joining the Contest.

I don't like this--it would be too complex, I think.  I'd rather see two
separate sets of rules, with one "slaved" to the other as described
above.

> There would be the contestants in the contest Recursa, who have to be

May be... speaker.  Since there will be non-Agoran Recursans, and the
"Contestmaster" is an *Agoran* artifact, we should disassociate the
Contestmaster from duties within Recursa.  Maybe award the title to
Swann permanently, as an honor. :)

I think that there should be a 1-1 correspondence between Recursa
Contestants and Recursa Group Members.  Even if Contestmaster is
disassociated from eir Speaker-like duties, e could be Vizier and
Ordinancekeepor.

Yes.  As a thought--they can be "members" of the Recursa Group as well,
having Voting rights and being required by the regs to follow Group
Ordinances as well.  Of course, in the viewpoint of Agora, they still
don't exist, but there is no reason that *we* can't acknowledge them.  I
think there is precedent for this--PROSIRUP had something of the sort in
their Secret Rules, where non-Agorans had voting righs within the Group.

Yes, well, I thought that that was a good thing at the time. There were
a couple other "potential" paradoxes, including one other CfJ which
could have finished the game off if I had judged TRUE instead of 
UNDECIDED.

I think there was a general feeling that the ruleset had some serious
problems, and there currently are efforts to rewrite it (outside the
Rules, as it were).

There's also a rule which says "If a Proposal gets no FOR votes, it 
shall be accepted" which has caused problems in the past and looks like
it's staying in ...

After I read your reply, I went back and looked at the Agora Guidebook ...
sure enough, there's a link to "degrees and theses" (which ends in
something like ".../archives/degrees") but it doesn't seem to actually 
be there.

Cool! Thanks. I think that I've seen some of these proposals on the

I'm not on nomic.discussion, so could you keep me abreast
of what people think of the nomic.net idea?

Personally, I think that we should see about getting in on it.
If not nomic.net, we could easily set up nomic.org . Or maybe
have nomic.net with agora.org or something.

Anyway, I'd like to see if we can get in on it, and how.

Like I said, keep me informed! =)

Really?  I didn't think the "nomic.net" would be all that viable.  But
if it's possible, it would be really neat.

Incidentally, I forwarded the original idea posting to the Fantasy Rules
Committee server (frc@nvg.unit.no) and the Agora Nomic Business list
(nomic-business@teleport.com), in case they were interested--you may
want to send your idea to other Nomics and Nomic variants...

Current Regulations:

(*) Denotes an Immutable Rule
(#) Denotes an Unmutable Rule

O. Unmutable Regulations

000# This contest is a sub-game of Agora Nomic and contestants must
     abide by all rules of Agora in effect.  Any regulation of this
     contest that is inconsistent with the rules of Agora Nomic is also
     void within the Sub-Nomic contest.

001# The entry fee of this contest shall be 5 points.

002# Whenever a term appears in the regulations that ambiguously could
     refer either to Agora Nomic or to Sub-Nomic, the term refers to
     Sub-Nomic.

003# Whenever the regulations state that a contestant has won the
     contest, that player becomes the contestmaster, if e consents.
     If e doesn't consent, the consenting contestant with the highest
     number of credits becomes the new contestmaster.  In case of a tie,
     the old contestmaster chooses a winner and new contestmaster.  When
     a new contestmaster is chosen, the old contestmaster becomes a
     contestant.

004# When a new contest begins, play continues with the regulations then
     in effect.

005# When a new contestmaster is selected, e receives the entire
     contents of the contest fund.  This is the only funds transfer
     allowed out of the contest fund.  After this transfer, no funds may
     be transferred out of the contest fund until a new contestmaster is
     again selected.

006# Whenever a new contest begins, and after the new contestmaster has
     received eis reward out of the contest fund, all contestants must
     put five points (or any currency the new contestmaster deems an
     acceptable substitute) into the contest fund.

007# The contestmaster must post all regulation changes to the public
     forum within 48 hours after the contestants' votes are tabulated,
     and no later than one week after the voting period has closed.

008# The contestmaster must accept any and all transfers into the
     contest fund, from whatever source.

I. Immutable Regulations

101*  All Contestants must always abide by all the Regulations then in
      effect, in the form in which they are then in effect.  The
      Regulations in the Initial Set are in effect whenever a contest
      begins.  The Initial set consists of regulations 000-008
      (unmutable), 101-116 (immutable), and 201-213 (mutable).

102*  Initially, regulations in the 100's are immutable and regulations
      in the 200's are mutable.  Regulations subsequently enacted or
      transmuted (i.e. changed from immutable to mutable or vice versa)
      may be mutable or immutable regardless of their numbers, and all
      non-unmutable regulations in the Initial Set may be transmuted
      regardless of their numbers.  Unmutable regulations may not be
      transmuted.

104*  All regulation changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted
      on. They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required 
      number of votes.

105*  Every contestant in this contest is an eligible voter.  Every
      eligible voter must participate in every vote on regulation
      changes.

106*  Any proposed regulation change must be written down and submitted
      to the Contestmaster before it is voted upon.  If adopted, it must
      guide play in the form in which it was voted on.

107*  No regulation change may take effect earlier than the moment of
      the completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording
      explicitly states otherwise.  No regulation change may have
      retroactive application.

110* Mutable regulations that are inconsistent in any way with some
     immutable regulation (except by proposing to transmute it) are
     wholly void and without effect.  They do not implicitly transmute
     immutable regulations into mutable regulations and at the same time
     amend them.  Regulation changes that transmute immutable
     regulations into mutable regulations will be effective if and only
     if they explicitly state their transmuting effect.

     Regulations in conflict with any unmutable regulations are wholly
     void and without effect.

112* The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be changed
     from the achieving N credits to any other state of affairs.
     However, the magnitude of N and the means of earning credits my be
     changed, and the regulations that establish a winner when play
     cannot continue may be enacted and (while they are mutable) be
     amended or repealed.

113* A contestant always has the option to forfeit the contest rather
     than continue to play or incur a penalty.  No penalty, worse than
     losing, in the judgment of the player to incur it, may be imposed.

114* There must always be at least one mutable regulation.  The adoption
     of regulation changes must never become completely impermissible.

115* Regulations that affect regulations needed to allow or apply
     regulation changes are as permissible as other regulation changes.
     Even regulation changes that amend or repeal their own authority
     are permissible.  No regulation change or type of move is
     impermissible solely on account of the self-reference or
     self-application of a regulation.

116* Whatever is not explicitly prohibited or regulated by a regulation
     is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing
     the regulations, which is permitted only when a regulation or set
     of regulations explicitly or implicitly permits it.

II. Mutable Regulations

205. An adopted regulation change takes full effect at the moment of the
     completion of the vote that adopted it.

211. If two or more mutable regulations conflict with one another, or if
     two or more immutable regulations conflict with one another, or if
     two or more unmutable regulations conflict with one another, then
     the regulation with the lowest ordinal number takes precedence.

     Unmutable regulations take precidence over all other regulations.
     Immutable regulations take precidence over all mutable regulations.

     If at least one of the regulations in conflict explicitly says of
     itself that it defers to another regulation (or type of regulation)
     or takes precedence over another regulation (or type of
     regulation), then such provisions shall supersede the numerical
     method for determining precedence.

     If two or more regulations claim to take precedence over each
     other, or to defer to one another, then the numerical method must
     again govern.

213. If the regulations are changed so that further play is impossible,
     or if the legality of a move is impossible to determine with
     finality, or if by the judge's best reasoning, not overruled, a
     move appears equally legal or illegal, then the player with the
     most credits wins.  This regulation takes precedence over every
     other rule determining who wins this contest.

III. 

302. All People who legally participate in Recursa shall be called
     Recursans.

309. A regulation change is adopted if the number of votes cast for it
     are equal to or greater than the number of votes against, unless
     that regulation change transmutes an immutable rule, in which case
     the number of for votes must be equal or greater than two times the
     number of against votes for it to pass.

310. Whenever a vote is taken, the legal votes are "for," "against," and
     "abstain."  If a voter does not send in a vote that explicitly
     states that it is "for" or "against," then the vote is counted as
     "abstain." If a voter does not submit a required vote by the time
     votes are required to be tabulated, that voter is counted as voting
     "abstain" on all unsubmitted votes.  A vote of "abstain" is not
     counted as part of the total when determining unanimity.  Unanimity
     is defined as receiving no votes "against."

     Whenever a voter casts a vote that is not "abstain" that voter
     gains one credit.

313. When a proposal passes, the Recursan who proposed it shall recieve
     credits equal to the number of votes "for" the proposal.

316. The term 'Recursa Rule' shall be synonymous with 'regulation of the
     SubNomic contest'. If the term 'rule' is used in the regulations or
     proposals of this contest without reference to any specific nomic,
     it shall be interpereted to mean 'Recursa Rule'.

317.  A regulation change is any of the following:
      
        i) The enactment, amendment, or repeal of a mutable regulation.
       ii) The enactment, amendment, or repeal of an amendment.
      iii) The transmutation of a immutable regulation into a mutable
           regulation or vice versa.
      
      No regulation change may affect an unmutable regulation.

319*  The Name of this Nomic shall be Recursa.

320.  The contestmaster shall give each proposed regulation change an
      ordinal number for reference.  The numbers shall begin with 301,
      and each regulation change proposed in the proper way shall
      receive the next successive integer, whether or not the proposal
      is adopted.

      If a regulation is repealed and re-enacted, it receives the number 
      of the proposal to re-enact it.  If a regulation is amended or
      transmuted, it receives the ordinal number of the proposal to
      amend or transmute it.  If an amendment is amended or repealed,
      the entire regulation of which it is a part receives the ordinal
      number of the proposal to amend or repeal the amendment.

321. If a regulation change as proposed is unclear, ambiguous,
     paradoxical, or destructive of play, or if it arguably consists of
     two or more regulation changes compounded, or is an amendment that
     makes no difference, of if it is otherwise of questionable value,
     then the other players may debate against the proposal before the
     vote. One week is allowed for this debate, from the time the
     contestmaster submits the proposal to all contestants, after which
     time the vote is taken.

322. All contestants are Recursians, but a person may be a Recursan
     without being a contestant.  Such Recursans are referred to as
     unbound.

     An unbound Recursan cannot win the contest or become contestmaster.
     An unbound Recursan is an eligible voter, and may submit proposals
     to the contestmaster.

323. Recursans may propose regulation changes by submitting them to
     the contestmaster, who must then distribute the proposed change to
     all Recursans for debate.  The contestmaster must distribute all
     properly-submitted proposals within a week of receiving them.

324. If Recursans disagree about the legality of a move or the
     interpretation or application of a regulation, then the
     contestmaster must chose a Recursan other than the Recursan
     alleging the illegal move, or the Recursan who allegedly made
     the illegal move, and appoint that Recursan as judge.  That
     Recursan must then decide the question.  Disagreement, for the
     purposes of this rule, may be created by the insistence of any
     Recursan.  Such a process is called "invoking judgment."

     The selected judge has one week to render an opinion.  If the judge
     does not, the contestmaster may rule on the issue eimself.

     The judge's judgment may be overruled only by unanimous vote of
     the other Recursans.  Such overturning must be in a proposal sent
     to the contestmaster, and voted upon in the same way as proposed
     regulation changes.  If such a proposal passes, the contestmaster
     chooses a new judge in the same manner as before, with the same
     restrictions.  No Recursan may judge the same question twice. If
     there are no remaining eligible Recursans to serve as judge, the
     contestmaster must decide the question.

     If the contestmaster issues a judgment, the ruling is final.

     All judgments must be written and submitted to the contestmaster,
     who must distribute them to all Recursans within a week.

     New judges are not bound by the decisions of old judges.  New
     judges may, however, settle only that question which e was assigned
     to judge.  All judgments by judges shall be in accordance to the
     regulations then in affect; but when the regulations are silent;
     inconsistent, or unclear on the point at issue, then the judge's
     only guides shall be common morality, common logic, and the spirit
     of the contest.

325. Each Recursan has exactly one vote.

326. When a proposal is defeated, the Recursan who proposed it shall
     lose credits equal to the number of votes "against" the proposal.

327. All Recursans begin a new contest with exactly zero credits.

330. In Recursa, there are two different things to "win": the contest,
     and the game.  Unless otherwise specified, a "winner" shall mean
     the winner of the game.
     
     The contest may be won when a proposal or rule specifies that it
     does. The winner of thecContest shall be the contestant specified
     in the proposal, or if none is specified, then a contestant chosen
     by the contestmaster to win the contest.

331. The winner of the game shall be any Recursan who has 100 credits.
     If multiple Recursans achieve 100 at the same time, the one with
     the most credits wins the game.  If multiple Recursans have the
     most credits (a tie), the contestmaster shall choose the winner of
     the game.

  I trust you received my previous missive. I am considering
undertaking the project of writing the history of Agora and
Nomic World from their origins. I have had a chance to talk
to Steve and to go through the archives you have posted on
quincy.edu, particularly the CFj and proposal files. May
I commend you on a great job. I am amazed how much is
preserved, as I know there were some great difficulties
when you took over the office. With this information, I
can work out a preliminary chronological skeleton for Agora. 
As for Nomic World, Steve says he has some files, and there is
of course Michael's www page which has Steve's summaries
and some old rulesets (I have one myself). 
   With regard to agra, there remain the discussion logs for
teleport and yoyo. Of course I am not going to include every
little topic discussed, but there are some seminal issues I
can only get from the posts themselves. (And I have personal
interest, also). I presume the teleport logs are the easiest
to access. Steve suggested the yoyo logs still exist, but
were difficult to use. Could you give me some details?
  At any rate, it seems that the minimal amount of information
exists for this project to be practicable. I hope you will
assist me closely in acquiring the necessary information. This
promises to be a huge undertaking, but also a very interesting one.

Ah . I hadn't realised you responded to my first message when
I sent my second. This is very helpful. Please don't clear out
shamino; I need the information there first, as it is most
important for my history (as you now no doubt realize, me having 
actually told you). I guess you can mail me the first month's
logs, if they're not too big. However, I don't have much
experience with this system (although it is UNIX). I would
want to transfer it to the mac I'm working on now. That's why
ftp is so useful: I can download it directly, bypassing my
account. Once it is e-mailed, have any ideas how I can transfer
it to my computer? I use telnet to get to my account.

Thanks ever so much,
Vlad

Aggh!  Why didn't you *ask* Contest members before announcing this one?
I would have been perfectly willing to drop the X Group for a Recursa
Group.  *I*, for one, don't want to have to maintain two different lists
of players--members of the group should be members of the contest.

But more importantly, why have you recreated a new Initial Ruleset for
the Group?  What I think would be *much* more effective would be a very
simple set of Ordinances:
1) The Vizier and Ordinancekeepor of this Group is the Contestmaster of
the Subnomic Contest, and is changed whenever the Contestmaster changes.
2) All Group members must be members of the Subnomic Contest; any Player
who is a member of the Subnomic Contest and requests to join this Group
is automatically admitted, and any Group member who leaves the Contest
is automatically ejected from this Group.
3) The Ordinances may be changed only as specified in the Subnomic
Contest Regulations.

This would be enough of a start; it would essentially "slave" the Group
to the Contest (computer network users know what I mean) and maintain a
single set of rules for us poor Recursans to keep track of.  Plus, the
Group should be called Recursa.

On another note, I again ask: do any of you have access to a computer
with listserv capabilities?  It gets irritating to have to reset the To
field every time I want to mail the group.

I haven't "announced" anything.  The hypothetical group has yet to
exist.  If another Recursa member (I believe Xanadu or half of Xanadu
expressed an interest) expressed an interest I would gladly have a
"slave" group to Recursa....  I sent a letter to that effect awhile ago
and didn't get much of a response.

The hypothetical group is just an idea, the Recursa group idea still takes
precidence over it *if* enough people are interested.

ie.  enough to form the Group.

Going through my old records I have
found some interesting things. One of
them is an old Ruleset which preserves
some proposals not found in your archives.
I need to go through and figure out
which were rule creations and which
amendments. It also provides a dilemma
concerning the date of the ruleset and
the date of the proposals in the archive.
The rules in the ruleset are so similar to
those in the archive that I assumed that
the archive represented an old Ruleset.
Since almost all of the proposals in the
archive passed, that seemed correct.
Yet which came first? Since my ruleset 
preserved some proposals the archives don't,
I concluded the archives came later and those
rules had been repealed. Yet the archive also 
has rules not in the ruleset!
  The mystery deepens. The ruleset ends at rule 783,
implying a date in December. The archives cut off
at proposal 792, slightly later. Moreover, the
proposal after 783, 784, is preserved by the
archives, was authored by me (and failed!). Why
is it preserved in the archives? I believe it
dated to early December. The archives would seem to
end in early January. I'm not sure why I would have
kept such a ruleset, but if I did, why is it
incomplete? It is clear some Quellenkritik is 
necessary. Will keep you updated.

  Declined by favor Tue, 1 Aug 95 11:23:23 EDT
  Assigned to Vanyel {as of this message}

============================================================

Arguments of Caller (elJefe):

For one thing, there is no allegation in the Statement against a
particular Player.

Nor is there evidence in the record that the Vizier committed an
illegal act.  "Performing the dissolution" is meaningless.  The Ordinance
says that the group dissolves upon receiving the consent of the members.
So are you looking for the person/persons giving consent?  And where is
the evidence that the Vizier actually gave consent?

PROPOSAL 1663 (Steve) AI=1, protoed
Fix a bug in 1465

Amend Rule 1465 by changing the last sentence of the first paragraph
to read:

      Responsibility is given to the Registrar to accurately record
      in eir Report the times of commencement and conclusion of
      of all Champion's Rewards which have been granted and have not
      yet been withdrawn.

Comment: as things stand, the Registrar would have to keep noting,
for instance, that kelly's Reward commenced on Jun 19, 1995, and
concluded on Jul 17, 1995, long after this information has ceased to
be of interest.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROPOSAL 1664 (SugarWater) AI=1
The Aristocrat

	There exists a rule with the following text:

	These exists a type of Nomic Entity known as an
	Aristocrat.  An Aristocrat is a Voting Entity.

	An Aristocrat has a Default Vote and a Name.  Each Aristocrat 
	will Vote once on each proposal.  Unless the Aristocrat is
	Influenced in a manner defined by these rules, that Vote
	will be the Default Vote.  The Assessor keeps track of
	Aristocrat Votes, and those Votes are publishes in 
	eir report(s) along with Player Votes.

	The number of Aristocrats is added to the number of
	Active Players for the purposes of determining Quorom.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROPOSAL 1665 (SugarWater) AI=1
Establishment of Initial Aristocrats

	There exists a rule with the following text:

	There exists an Aristocrat whose Name is Fortinbras.
	Fortinbras' Default Vote is FOR.

	There exists an Aristocrat whose Name is Augustine.
	Augustine's Default Vote is AGAINST.

	There exists an Aristocrat whose Name is Zombie.
	Zombie's Default vote is ABSTAIN.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROPOSAL 1666 (SugarWater) AI=1
Influence of Aristocrats

	There exists a rule with the following text:

	It is possible to change the vote of an Aristocrat by
	Influencing them.

	To Influence an Aristocrat, a Player must send a message 
	containing the following to the Assessor:

		1) The name of the Aristocrat to be Influenced.

		2) The Intended Vote of the Aristocrat.

		3) A number of Marks, which the Player must own.

	For the purposes of this Rule, a Step Modifier is a 
	number of Marks based upon the difference between an
	Aristocrat's Default Vote, and the Vote which an Influencing Player 
	intends the Aristocrat to make.  The Step Modifier between a Vote of
	FOR and a Vote of AGAINST (or vice versa) is 1 (one) Mark.  
	The Step Modifier between a vote of ABSTAIN and any other Vote
	(or vice versa) is .5 (one-half) Mark.


	To determine the Vote of an Aristocrat, the Assessor must
	evaluate the Influence of the Players.  The Influence of the
	Player is the number of Marks offered in their
	Influencing message minus the Step Modifier of the
	intended Vote.

	If an Aristocrat receives no Influence, or if all
	Influence intended for that Aristocrat is negative or zero,
	The Vote of that Aristocrat is its Default Vote.
	Otherwise, the Vote of the Aristocrat is the Intended Vote
	defined by the Player with the most Influence over that
	Aristocrat.  In the event that more than one Player
	has equal Influence over an Aristocrat, a random Player
	is selected from among those Players, and that Player
	has Influence over that Aristocrat.

	If a Player successfully influences an Aristocrat, a number of
	Marks equal to the number offered in eir Influencing message
	is transferred from that Player to the Bank.

	It is the job of the Assessor to monitor the Votes of the
	Aristocrats, determine the Influence of Players, and report
	resulting Marks transfers to the Bankor.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 1667 (Chuck) AI=1
Truth in Advertising

This Proposal contains one proposed Rule Change and zero Directives.

I. A Rule shall be created with the following text:

      No Player shall present, as correct, information which e
      believes to be incorrect in any of the following:
        -a post to the Public Forum
        -evidence in a COE, CFJ, or Judgement
        -a response to a request for information which the
         Player is required to provide.

[This prevents deliberate posting of incorrect Officer Reports or
deliberate forgeries as evidence.  Both of these have been legal
since the beginning of Agora.  Still legal would be: accidentally
incorrect Officer Reports; using incorrect reports as evidence
as long as they were presented as incorrect; and information which
the poster has no belief on one way or the other.

After some discussion of the appropriate penalty for violation of
this Rule, I have decided not to include a penalty clause at this
time.  I will propose to amend it to include a penalty clause (if
no one else has already done it) after Kelly's Crime proposal
passes or fails.]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 1668 (Chuck) AI=1
Fix Rule Title Change Directive AI's

This Proposal contains one proposed Rule Change and zero Directives.

I.  The part of Rule 1485 which currently reads

      A Rule's Title may be changed by a Directive. The Adoption Index
      of a Proposal containing such a Directive must be at least as
      great as the Mutability Index of the Rule. The Directive must
      unambiguously state the number of the Rule and the new Title.

is amended to read

      A Rule's Title may be changed by a Directive.  The Adoption Index
      of a Proposal containing such a Directive must be at least 2.
      The Directive must unambiguously state the number of the Rule and
      the new Title.

[The Title of a Rule has no effect whatsoever on the application of
the Rule.  It is, in this respect, similar to the category of the
Rule in the Logical Ruleset.  Thus, similar to changing the category
of the Rule, changing the Title of the Rule should have a fixed AI
of 2 rather than tying it to the MI of the Rule as 1485 currently does.

2 rather than 1 (similar to changing the category) to prevent arbitrary
changes of Rule Titles.  Conversely, there is absolutely no reason
why changing the Title of a MI=4 Rule should require an AI of 4!

I suggested this to KoJen when the proposal to create 1485 was
in the proto stage, and I don't know why he didn't incorporate
it into the proposal.]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROPOSAL 1669 (Chuck) AI=1
Currency Directive AI=1

This Proposal contains one proposed Rule Change and zero Directives.

I.  Rule 1466 is amended by deleting the sentence

      A Proposal containing one or more Currency Directives has an
      Adoption Index of 2, or higher if something else in the Proposal
      requires a higher index.

[There is absolutely *no* incentive to use a Currency Directive
with AI=2 when a self-repealing rule will have the same effect with
AI=1.  In my mind, the primary reason for the existence of Currency
Directives is not to make it more difficult to change Currencies,
but to avoid the ugly kludge of a self-repealing Rule.  The
current Rule 1466 utterly fails in this.  (See Swann's Proposal
1652 for an example.)

One might argue that we merely need to better define what sort
of transfers are described in Currency Directives, and what
sort of transfers are described in Rules, but I would argue that
you can never specify that clearly enough.  The only way to
have currency transfers require AI=2 is to require any Rules
specifying currency transfers to have an AI=>2, and I don't
think that's what we want.]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROPOSAL 1670 (Chuck) AI=1
Correction to Prop 1640

This proposal contains one proposed rule change and zero directives.

I. Rule 1446 shall be amended by deleting the paragraph which
begins, "If the Contest Regulations require a transfer to be made, but
the Contest Fund has insufficient currencies to permit that transfer to
be made" shall be deleted.

[This is what the second rule change in proposal 1640 was supposed to
do, but I had accidentally put "1466" instead of the "1446" it
should be.  Doesn't anyone check these things???]

Archivist Vanyel,

I just went to look at CFJ 737 in the archives (just for nostalgia's
sake), but I could find there only your original Judgement. I seem
to remember there being an Appeal, and I seem to remember Judging
it. Have the Appeal Judgements been lost forever?

Hello!  My name is Don Blaheta, and I am the Ambassador of Agora Nomic
(my nickname there is "Vanyel").  One of our members forwarded me your
post to alt.games.abstract, so I'm responding.

Agora was started in June of 1993, and is still going strong with around
20 members.  We make proposals to change our ruleset, and vote on those
proposals; the ruleset is currently about 200 Rules long, and many, many
K.  To get a copy of the ruleset, ftp to ftp.quincy.edu (anonymously, of
course), and navigate through /pub/users/blahedo/agora.  This is the FTP
location of the Agora Nomic Archives.  (You said you didn't have Web
access, but the URL is http://www.quincy.edu/~blahedo/agora.html)  There
you can pick up the ruleset.  Usually I have other Agora stuff there,
but I'm pushing quota at the moment. :)

We have four mailing lists: nomic-official, nomic-business,
nomic-discussion, and yoyo.  To find out how to join these various
lists, send mail to majordomo@teleport.com, with "info nomic-official"
in the body of your message.  To be a Player you must be subscribed to
nomic-official, nomic-business, and yoyo, but nomic-discussion is also
very highly recommended.

I hope to see more of you, then!

Ambassador Vanyel

Steve and i spent a copuple hours chatting about this sort of stuff
last night.  this is a rough writeup of what we talked about, and i
thought i'd ask your opinions on it as well.

Chuck, is JAN still around?  i might consider submitting this after i

----------------------------------------------------------------------

A Theory of Agoran Metaphysics

Recently, several Players, especially Morendil, have sough to
establish a standard by which "moves" must be recorded for future
examination, and which only gives legal force to those moves which are
properly recorded.  This author believes that one of major problems
with this effort is that the concept of "move" is not currently
well-defined in the Agoran framework.  This paper seeks to establish a
theory of Agoran metaphysics in which the concept of "move" (or, more
properly, "event") is consistently established, in the hopes that we
can better understand what is meant by an "move" in Agora Nomic.

For the purposes of this discussion, we shall presume that the
Agoraverse is wholly causal, in that everything that takes place
within it is caused by something else.  The First Cause, which created
the Agoraverse, was the adoption of the Initial Rules; with this act
(which was caused by the collective will of the Players who implicitly
agreed upon these Rules), is an example of what we shall call
Miracles: uncaused causes.  As we shall see, every Player action is a
Miracle.

A further note before we proceed.  It is obvious, upon brief
reflection, that the Rules do not completely define the physical laws
of the Agoraverse.  The author is of the belief, however, that the
Rules, taken together with Game Custom, do in fact completely define
the physical laws of the Agoraverse.  When the author refers to the
Rules, from here forth, this shall be taken to include Game Custom in
its aspect in "completing" the Agoran system of axiomatic law.  It is
worth nothing at this juncture that the process of Judging a CFJ is
therefore not merely one of axiomatic reasoning, but also one of
creation: the Judge must create--or perhaps discover--new Game Custom
to fill the gaps in the Rules themselves.

So, let us attempt to define what a move is.  On a first glance, it
seems that a move is an action which causes some change in the Game
State.  But what is the Game State?  The Game State is merely the
collective of all the properties which the Rules have defined.  It is
important to note that we do not speak here of entities, but rather of
properties.  Players are entities which are not defined by the Rules.
If we were to define a move as any change to an entity defined by the
Rules, then any change to a Player, even to a property of a Player
defined solely by the Rules, would not be a move, and this fails to
serve our purposes.  So, we instead define the Game State to be the
collection of all the properties that are defined by the Rules, and we
provisionally define a move as a Player action which in some way
changes the Game State.  

Yet here we have a problem.  It appears that certain changes to the
Game State occur without any specific action on the part of any
Player.  For example, every week, Salaries are paid out to Officers.
While the Scorekeepor is required to detect and report these changes
to the Game State, e does not cause them: they are instead caused by
the Rules themselves.  So it appears that the Game State can change
without the act of any Player.  Let us, therefore, refer to any change
of any property of the Game State as an "event", without regard to the
causation of the event.

Now, we have agreed to consider the Agoraverse to be completely
causal: every event therefore has a cause.  Some events are caused
strictly as a consequence of the Rules (and, again, here the author
stresses that "the Rules" here is intended to include Game Custom as
well as any subsidiary elements such as Ordinances or Contest
Regulations which have the semblance of Rules), while others seem to
erupt from nowhere within the Agoraverse.  These latter events are
precisely those which are caused by Players, and are the moves we seek
to define.  Since moves appear to spring from nowhere, we shall call
them Miracles; every move is a Miracle, and the terms are effectively
interchangable. 

So now we have defined an event as the change in the Game State, and
further defined a move as an event caused by a Player.

Now, clearly, Players are not omnipotent gods: no Player can simply,
say, cause a Rule to cease to exist.  So we have to make one of two
choices here, when dealing with what are commonly called "illegal
moves".  Either "illegal moves" are not moves at all, in that they
have no effect on the Rules, or they are in fact moves, but moves
which have effect other than the obvious intent of the Player.  This
author favors the latter interpretation.  The first interpretation
prevents us from penalizing "illegal moves", for it claims that
illegal moves are not moves at all.  But how can a penalty arise
(clearly an event) from something which has not occured?  Doesn't this
violate our principle of causation?  If we, instead, adopt the
principle that Miracles may (or may not) trigger further
non-miraculous events, as specified by the (extended) Rules, we avoid
this entire quagmire.  

A consequence of this principle is that Miracles cannot be retracted.
Once a Player has performed a miracle, it is a fait accompli, a
permanent part of the history of the Agoraverse.  The Player, or
another Player, might later perform another Miracle whose effect is to
partially or wholly reverse the effect of the first, but that's not
the same as retracting the first miracle, because time has passed.

However, if we consider the subsequent nonmiraculous events arising
consequential to a miracle, we see that, in a manner of speaking,
these can be "retracted".  The retraction of a "move", therefore,
consists in determining, as a matter of fact, that some or all of the
physical events initially believed to have occurred consequent to the
move actually did not occur, and that our perception of the Agoraverse
was flawed in this regard (obviously, the author is a Platonist!).
It is also possible that, as a consequence of this determination, it
is found that other events, not initially believed to have taken
place, have in fact taken place.

The determination spoken of above is not necessarily arrived by
through the process of a Call for Judgement.  A Call for Judgement is
itself a sequence of moves.  As previously noted, the act of Judging a
CFJ not only serves to determine facts about the Game State, but can
also change the (extended) Rules, through the creation of Game Custom.
It is important to note that Judging a CFJ is itself a Miracle!

It is worth pointing out that the Rules wholly determine the timing
and nature of those nonmiraculous events which occur subsequent to a
Miracle, and also that the "legality" of a move is merely an attribute
of that move.  Illegal moves exist, and in fact have just as much
power to trigger events as "legal" moves.  All that it means for a
move to be illegal is that it does not comply with that portion of the
Rules that determine what moves possess the property of legality.
Illegal moves still take place, and still have whatever effects (that
is, subsequent events) that the Rules permit them to have, the same as
legal moves.

			PROPOSAL TO DO NOTHING

The amended proposal on the table is the following:
	The Student Senate "Do Nothing" committee has been established to 
accomplish absolutely nothing.  Doing nothing productive often wastes a 
valuable amount of Senate's time; so it has become necessary to delegate 
this task to a commitee.  The committee will consist of students from the 
following six clubs:  The College Libertarians, The College Democrats, 
The College GOP, Delta Sigma Pi, the North Campus Lifeguard Club, and the 
QU Drinking Club.
	The Student Senate receives 24 hours per each day of each 
semester (excepting time change days).  This time is available to be 
wasted as follows:
	30% for sleeping purposes
	30% for eating purposes
	30% for watching TV
	10% for wasting money
	The following guidelines will be observed.  The minimum amount of 
money to be spent of wasteful items will be increased from $50 to $400.  
Note that the three year minimum expected life of these products will be 
alxo eliminated.  Also, time normally used for eating can be wasted on 
useless meetings instead.  Note that if any member misses a substantial 
amount of meetings, he/she cannot be replaced by a reasonably appointed 
member from the general student population, as they are not as qualified 
to wasted time as the above listed members.




This proposal is intended for entertainment purposes only.  It is not for 
use in an actual Senate meeting.  All similarities are purely coincidental.

Hello!  I was forwarded your request to know about the Agora Nomic
mailing lists.  As Ambassador of Agora Nomic, I'm sending you this
informational packet, and info on how to find more.

ABOUT AGORA

Agora is one of the older net-Nomics in existence.  Running since June
1993, it has grown from 6 players to 21, and the ruleset has gone from a
mere handful of rules to over 200.  We always welcome new Players, and
we like to try to make their initial stay a bit easier.

The Agora Ruleset is fairly complex--it is, after all, the basis of the
game, and has been evolving for almost two-and-a-half years--but the
basic info that needs to be understood at first is relatively small.
The more in-depth aspects of the game (Contests, Groups, Kudos, Win
Tokens, etc.) can be ignored, initially.

To find out more about us, visit our web pages, at the following address:

http://www.quincy.edu/~blahedo/agora/

That is the Official Agora Home Page, maintained by the Ambassador,
Vanyel, and contains links to the most current ruleset, recent officer
reports, and the Archives (also maintained by Vanyel).  Most important
to the Agora newbie is the Agora Guidebook, just revised to 3rd edition;
this should give a general idea of how things work and some of the
general Agoran customs, without reading the now-greater-than-250K
ruleset.

If you have any additional questions about Agora, Nomic in general, or
anything else mentioned above, mail me at blahedo@quincy.edu.

Well, I will of course obey the Regulations of the Contest.

H. Banker:
  I transfer 6 Marks from myself to the Repeal Bookie contest.

  If possible, I ratify all Mark transfers made from me on my
  behalf by the Repeal Bookie contest before Oct. 22.  

  If that is not possible and the transfers are invalidated, I 
  transfer a number of Marks from myself to the Repeal Bookie
  equal to the amount of the invalidated transfers before Oct. 22.

I know how that can be; fortunately, I only had one really heavy

I know how to get listings; the reason we were wondering was a little
miniScam where TAL logged on from his French account (which we have
never seen before) as "Nucleon", Voted, transferred all eir Marks to
Kelly, and deregistered, never to be heard from again.  In the ensuing
confusion, we tried to invalidate it on the basis of "Nucleon" not being
subscribed, but of course we later realized that that *address* didn't
need to be subscribed... well, anyway, it turned out all right.  But I'd
still like to see the "official" stuff.  If something's a real problem,
I can just forward it back to you to handle sometime within a month or
two. :)

What happened?  *WHEW*  Here's the _short_ version:

Starting about two months ago, Swann suggested combining Contests,
Groups, and Contracts into one general enabling legislation.  This
developed into a behemoth change, which was really very well thought
out, but of course buggy (everything is).  Kelly decided that this was
too much too soon (funny coming from em), and campaigned vehemently
against it, even to the point of coming up with a combination of eir
own, this time of only Contests and Groups.  Well, eir Proposal failed
and Swann's passed.  The only three Players who voted against it (Kelly,
elJefe, Steve) then formed a group called "The Threat", and began
wreaking havoc.  First they said that Groups initiated prior to the
Organization Proposal no longer existed because of the lack of a
grandfather clause.  There was a lot of argument about this, but it
later turned out that this was only a distraction tactic from their
*real* goal: the Mousetrap.  The Mousetrap was an alleged Organization
of undefined Class (i.e. not a Group, not a Contest, and not a
Contract), which they created, which was allowed to draft all Players
involuntarily into its Jurisdiction, and coerce them to do things, and
not even tell them what the Statutes (i.e. Ordinances) were.  This, in
turn, caused a few people to deregister due to violation of their "civil
liberties", and the Threat caught a lot of flak for the way they handled
the whole thing, and Kelly was really abusive of Swann (for trying to
pass a Proposal, I guess), and *that* caused even _more_
deregistrations.  I believe there were a total of 5 deregistrations:
Kelly, Swann, Erick, Vlad, and KoJen.  (Erick was a new Player, too--e
had just joined!)  Quite a mess.  We're still sorting through the CFJ
aftermath now, as I'm sure you can see.  Of course, just prior to eir
deregistration, Kelly proposed the Green Repeals...

Hi, Vanyel--

I understand you may soon apply to join The Threat.  These are the
procedures to be followed:

First, you should resign from X Group, by sending a message to the Notary
and to the Group Vizier.

Next, you should apply to me in a message, explicitly requesting to 
become a member.

Third, the Members will vote on your acceptance to membership. (This 
should not take long!) I'll vote FOR, and upon Steve's consent I will 
inform the Notary of your election.

Meanwhile, here are the latest Ords. for your perusal.

P.S. are you willing to become Vizier should the opportunity arise?

------------------
Current Ordinances
------------------

===================================================================
    Basic Ordinances
===================================================================

1.  (Always a Vizier)
    If the other Ordinances do not legally specify a valid choice 
    for Vizier, the Vizier is the member whose name appears first 
    on the List of Members.  This Ordinance takes precedence over
    all other Ordinances.

    The Ordinancekeepor shall be the same person as the Vizier.

2.  (Precedence of Ordinances)
    Should two or more Ordinances conflict, the one created least
    recently takes precedence, except when otherwise clearly specified
    by the Ordinances.  For purposes of this Ordinance, the original
    Ordinances are created as of the moment of the original adoption
    of these Ordinances, in numerical order.  Amendment of an
    Ordinance does not affect its creation date for purposes of this
    Ordinance.

3.  (Vizier's Authority)
    Whenever the Rules or the Ordinances require the group to take
    an action, the Vizier shall perform such action as Executor of 
    the Group.  In such cases, the Vizier shall certify to the 
    appropriate persons that the action is authorized by the Ordinances.
    Otherwise the Vizier does not act as Executor.

===================================================================
    Public Messages and Propositions
===================================================================

4.  Voting Members are defined to be those members of the group who 
    are not under Interdict, as described in other Ordinances.

5.  If a Voting Member sends a message to the Vizier with a 
    request that it be forwarded to all Voting Members, the Vizier
    shall do so as soon as possible.  A message so sent is known as
    a Public Message, as is any message sent to all Voting Members.

6.  A Proposition is defined to be a formal proposal of a type described 
    in the Ordinances and sent by a Voting Member in a Public Message.

7.  Active Members are those Voting members who are either not On Hold,
    or who have during the previous two weeks sent a Public Message, 
    either with regard to a Proposition or to the Group Vote on a Proposal, 
    or requesting to remain active;

8.  Generally, A Proposition is defined to be "adopted" when, within seven 
    days after it is sent in a Public Message, a majority of Active Members 
    sends a Public Message consenting to it.

    Other Ordinances may define different conditions for adoption of
    specific types of Propositions.

    The Vizier shall maintain a record of adopted Propositions.

===================================================================
    Powers of the Group
===================================================================

9.  A new member shall be admitted to the Group upon adoption of a 
    Proposition to do so.

10. A Voting Member shall be placed under Interdict, upon adoption 
    of a Proposition to do so; and e then ceases to be a Voting Member.
    The Interdict may be lifted from a member, upon adoption of a 
    Proposition to do so, and e then becomes a Voting Member.

11. A new Ordinance may be created, or an existing Ordinance changed 
    or repealed, upon adoption of a Proposition to do so; except that
    no such Proposition may take effect without the consent of at least
    two members.

12. Currencies may be spent from the Treasury by the Vizier, upon
    adoption of a Proposition to do so.

13. The group shall elect to dissolve, upon adoption of a Proposition 
    to do so.

14. The Vizier shall send a message to the Registrar requesting the
    group be renamed, upon adoption of a Proposition to rename the
    Group to a specified name.  The Vizier shall request the name 
    specified in the Proposition.

15. A Member shall become Vizier, upon adoption of a Proposition to
    appoint that Member as Vizier.

16. Should the group be dissolved, each Voting Member's personal share 
    of the Treasury, as defined in other Ordinances, is returned to em, 
    and the remainder is divided among the Voting Members as equally as 
    possible, with any leftover remainder going to the member whose name
    appears first on the List of Members.  Any member leaving the 
    Group for any other reason shall not receive any part of the Treasury.

===================================================================
    List of Members
===================================================================

17. The List of Members shall be automatically changed in the following 
    ways:

    (a.) upon becoming Vizier, a member's name shall be moved 
           to the front of the list; 

    (b.) upon going On Hold, a member's name shall be moved to the 
           end of the list;

    (c.) upon coming Off Hold, upon eir request, or upon resigning 
           as Vizier, a member's name shall be moved after the name of 
           the last member not On Hold;

    (d.) upon becoming a Voting Member, a player's name is placed
           after the name of the last member not On Hold;

    (e.) upon ceasing to be a Voting Member, a member's name 
           is deleted from the list.

    (f.) upon being nominated as Vizier's successor by the Vizier,
           a member's name shall be placed immediately after that
           of the Vizier.

    The Vizier shall maintain a record of changes to the List of Members.

===================================================================
    Specification of Vizier
===================================================================

18. The Vizier may resign at any time; if at that time e appoints a 
    successor, that successor immediately becomes Vizier. However,
    the Vizier may nominate a successor without resigning immediately
    and in this case e remains Vizier.

19. The Vizier shall maintain a record of changes to the Viziership.

===================================================================
    The Treasury
===================================================================

20. Voting Members may place any or all Currencies in the Group
    treasury, which shall be added to eir personal share.  The Vizier 
    shall return any portion of a Voting Member's personal share 
    upon request, as soon as possible, provided this is allowed by the 
    Rules and the state of the Treasury, and provided that the member
    is not in arrears to the Group as specified in the Ordinances.

21. Coins of the Group may not be created.  Coins of the Group within
    the Group Treasury shall be destroyed at the option of the Vizier.

22. Upon the creation of the Group, each member's personal share of the 
    Group Treasury is zero.

    The Vizier shall maintain a record of changes to members' personal 
    shares of the Treasury, and of the Treasury itself.


===================================================================
    The Group Vote
===================================================================

23. Whenever a Proposal is distributed to all players, the Vizier shall
    seek to determine the consensus opinion of how the Group Vote shall
    be cast.  Each Member shall express an opinion FOR or AGAINST the
    Proposal, or may decline to express an opinion.

    If the a majority of the Active Members have the same opinion,
    the Group shall cast one vote accordingly.  The Vizier shall
    so inform the Assessor.

24. Whenever there are Extra Votes in the Group Treasury, Members
    not in arrears to the Group may indicate with their opinion on the 
    Group Vote, whether they favor using an Extra Vote FOR or AGAINST the 
    Proposal.  If a majority of the Active Members favor using an Extra 
    Vote, and this is in accord with the use of the Group's original vote, 
    then the Group shall cast one Extra Vote on the Proposal, in accordance 
    with the opinion. The Vizier shall so inform the Assessor.

    In case the Voting Periods for several Proposals overlap, the Vizier 
    shall apply existing Extra Votes to the Proposals in increasing 
    numerical order.

25. At the beginning of each Nomic Week, if there are fewer than 3 Extra
    Votes in the Group Treasury, one EV is transferred from each Member 
    to the Group Treasury.  The Vizier shall detect and report this transfer.

    If in this case a member has no EV's then the member shall owe the EV's
    to the Treasury as arrears.  A member must always pay off eir arrears, 
    to whatever extent possible, within 7 days, by transferring EV's to the 
    treasury from any treasury under eir actual control.

    The Vizier shall keep track of all members' arrears, if any.


- elJefe, Vizier of The Threat

They aren't done yet... you must have been accessing by FTP, right?  I
haven't put links in because they are not public yet.  You might notice
that the various "files" I mention in that page currently only contain
about four or five Proposals each.

I have, in one form or another, almost _all_ of the Proposals.  Some I
don't have results for, though.  When I say "the actual distribution", I
refer to the file of the form ####-####, which should contain the
Promotor's and Assessor's Reports relevant to that range of proposals...
eventually I plan to filter each Proposal out to individual files, but
this project is only about a week old.  I'm kinda hoping I can get some
of that done when I go home for US Thanksgiving break.

Sorry if those directories caused any confusion, but as you noticed they
really aren't yet ready for public use.  If you have a request for a CFJ
or Proposal, send it along.  (I know you've asked for the CFJs, but I
still haven't found all of them.  The ones I've got are _mostly_ in the
cfj directory you found, although a lot of them still have mail headers
on them.)

In Ohio, if you ignore an orator on Decoration day to such an extent as
to publicly play croquet or pitch horseshoes within one mile of the
speaker's stand, you can be fined $25.00.

Hi Vanyel,

I'm writing to you because I need your advice.

Here's the text of an exchange I've been having, purportedly with the
anonymous Proposer of Proposal 1587.

Here's my quandary: I'm pretty sure I know who proposed 1587. But
I've always maintained that I wouldn't distribute the results of
the Proposal without proof that the person who submitted it was a
Player. I've deliberately left vague what it is I will accept as
proof. Since I'm asking you for advice, I'll be completey honest
with you: I don't particularly want to be forced to publish the
results of P1587, since it will make every move I've made since
a week after the VP for that Proposal finished a violation of ASAP.
Yuk. I'd prefer to make the point that the use of anonymizing senders
makes it impossible to establish the identity of the sender, at least
for Agoran legal purposes. How do you stand on this issue?

Much more likely is that I'll say: fine, you say you're X and I believe
you. Now, how are you going to prove that X sent Proposal 1587 to Vanyel?

Yuck is right.  Umm...  Well, presumably, if nobody reports the ASAP
violation(s) nothing happens... As for "proof", well, the matter of
proof isn't terribly well-defined in Agora.  Mir 1587 says e has a
method of proving eir identity, which e will reveal to the Public Forum
sometime.  I guess e's expecting my help, judging from eir message to
you...  Of course, if I don't tell you (at least for now), then you can
honestly say you don't know who it is.  Hm.  I'll mail Mir 1587, and get
back to you.

It is against the law for a monster to enter the corporate limits of
Urbana, Illinois.

Let me guess: you have carefully retained the message that the anon
server sends to you the first time you use it, and which contains
an anonymous identifier for you to use in future messages. This
can be matched against the submission message you sent to Promotor
Vanyel.

Perfect timing!  I was just about to do a bit of research into
some old Proposals.  I only tried to get Proposals, but it worked
really well.  Incredibly fast!!  Great job!
