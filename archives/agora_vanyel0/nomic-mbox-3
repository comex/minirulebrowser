                  The Nomic Environment, Part I 

There have been several comments, and not a few arguments recently about
what does or does not affect the game of Agora Nomic. Some persons seem
to feel that the Rules are only a guideline, and that breaking them is
just a way of life. Others seem to feel that the Rules are inviolate and
should be followed to the letter at all times. Some persons feel that
simple Game Custom should guide play as much as the Rules do. Others
feel that if the Rules are silent, then there is nothing stopping them
from doing something. It seems as though there are as many views on what
the "Rules" really are as there are Players. We will attempt to address
some of these issues in the near future, but this part will focus on
the Rules and how they effect the Game. 

It would seem that the Rules would be quite simple. If it's in a Rule,
do it. However, it's not quite as easy as that according to some people.
There seems to be a vocal minority which are claiming that the Rules are
like Real Life Laws in that they do not require anything, but rather
attempt to guide our actions when possible. They may specify penalties
when they are not obeyed, but they do not actually coerce one into doing
something. We believe this to be untrue. Witness Rule 101: 

101.  All Players must always abide by the Rules then in effect... 

This seems to say quite simply that if you are to play the game, you are
required to obey the Rules. Always. This is not to say that the Rules
cannot be broken; on the contrary, some Rules cannot help but be broken
due to their unreasonable requirements, but one must at least put forth
one's best effort to obey the Rules. All the Rules. All the time. Although
there is no specified penalty for not doing so, failure to give one's
best effort over to obeying the Rules goes against the spirit of the
game and should go against one's conscience. 

There seems to be a trend lately towards drafting Rules which actually
assume that they will be broken and rely on this to make them work as
they are intended. The authors apparently do not realize that if one is
expected to break the Rules, then the Rules cease to be Rules and become
"guidelines." When this happens to a game like Nomic where the Rules are
the only thing holding the group of players together, chaos results and
the game ceases to exist as a game. 

To compare the Rules to laws in Real Life is a poor analogy as well. It
is true that both laws and the Rules attempt to govern the conduct of a
group of people, the major difference is that laws can impose Real Life
penalties against the will of the subject persons. The Rules can only
impose penalties with the consent of the subject Players. This means
that, by definition, the Rules are only binding if the Players consent
to being bound by the Rules. We refer once again to Rule 101: 

101.  All Players must abide by the Rules then in effect... 

We would contend that Rule 101 indicates that the only way to be a
Player is to make the best effort possible to obey the Rules. We would
point to the fact that in the Initial Rule Set, which was the set of
Rules for which this Rule was drafted, there was no other provision for
determining who was a Player or not. Any person who was willing to be
bound by the Rules was a Player. The development of additional
restrictions on who may be a Player has no effect on the effect of this
Rule. 


We will now pause for a commercial break. All interested partied please
don riot gear and flame shielding. Stay tuned for Part II, coming soon,
which will address the issue of Game Custom and how it works *with* the
Rules, not instead of the Rules... 



Enjoy!

I actually went Off Hold on 1996/01/02, as far as I can tell.

Please register me as a Player once again. I notice I
became deregistered c. Jan 1st. Might I ask why? My
proposals were submitted Dec. 16 and the voting period ended
10 days later. Add the 14 day Grace period and I should
have been good to go  until Jan 10th or so, and I hoped
I could eke out the remaining couple of days. Please note
I am not currently receiving n-d.

Sit back and watch, I think.  Chuck should be posting the ruleset in a
couple of days... various reports should trickle in... that'll give you
a rough idea of what's been happening lately.  What is *not* in a lot of
the documents is an explanation of what happened *this* Christmas:

Someone (I forget who already) submitted proposals to repeal every
single rule, much in the vein of the Black Repeals.  In fact, these were
nicknamed the Smaragdine Repeals (we have taken to "colouring" our
mass-repeals... there were the Grey Repeals shortly after you left, then
the Pink Repeals December of 94, then nothing much until the attempted
Green Repeals, the successfully submitted Smaragdine Repeals, and the
more recent gradual Tourmaline Repeals) and were mostly voted down...
but of course, everyone got voting bonuses.  And with a couple hundred
points in voting bonuses, nearly everyone was pushed into Championship.
The problem came when we tried to decide who was to be Speaker.  The
rules, according to *some* people, were unclear on this, and about five
gamestates popped up in which various people--as I recall, Morendil,
Andre, Swann, and Steve were the major candidates--were Speaker-Elect
(nowadays, one is "Speaker-Elect" before being "Speaker", to smooth the
transition).  However, at almost exactly that time, the *actual*
Speaker, Ian, kind of dropped off the face of the planet, and we ousted
him with the Speaker Abandonment rules, which make the Speaker-Elect
Speaker.

Unfortunately, we weren't entirely sure who the S-E was.

The situation was compounded by the fact that a couple Offices were
being temporarily performed by the Speaker, due to lack of Players;
also, Ian held a few Offices himself, which devolved to the new Speaker;
and in the Agoran Christmas spirit, people (including Officers) were
dropping like flies.  So nobody was quite sure who was performing the
duties of which Offices.  The worst part was that the Office of the CotC
was indeterminate--never a good situation.  It didn't help that at about
this time Morendil made a major power play for the Speakership, and
rather than supporting his position with an explanation of his
interpretaion of the rules, he admitted that his major qualification was
that he would be dedicated to the Office.  A nice sentiment, and
desirable, but not one to resolve gamestates with.

As we reasoned through the situation, we pretty well ruled out all but
the so-called "S-State" and "M-State", in which Swann and Morendil,
respectively, are Speaker.  Around this time a Proposal passed making
Andre the CotC; since the Promotor and Assessor were *not* indeterminate
(thank goodness!) this guaranteed that Andre was, in fact, the CotC.  He
is still processing the multitudes of CFJs that have arisen from this
situation, and we await their results.

As if it weren't bad enough, though, Kelly found a wonderful bit of
evidence against the M-State; on Dec 22, Morendil submitted a huge
number of Proposals, changed his mind, and disowned them.  Since
disowning incurs a penalty of 5 Points per Proposal disowned, and this
was before the huge game-win, Morendil would *not* have won the game,
and thus Swann would have been the winner.  At this point, Morendil
tried to pull another one--he stated that the 1000 point penalty,
because of some unclear legal mumbo-jumbo, did not occur.  We argued him
out of that position, and he pulled out yet another trick: he invoked
113 on us.

Now, 113, as you probably know, has a long history of attempted abuse.
But Morendil was serious--he said that he considered such a penalty
worse than deregistration, and that he deregistered under the provisions
of rule 113, thus cancelling the penalty.  He *further* argued that
since the penalty was cancelled, he *had* won the game, became Speaker,
and that as a result he *could not* be deregistered (rule 103)!  (Thus
the Battle of the Immutables begins. :)  Agora is now split into four
camps:

1) In his announcement on 21 Jan, Morendil announced his deregistration
as of that time, calling upon R. 113.  This retroactively removes the
1000 point penalty on 22 Dec, thus making him Speaker and making
deregistration impossible.  AKA the Speaker Paradox.  Proponents: only
Morendil, that I know of.

2) Morendil announced his deregistration on 21 Jan, and thus the dereg
occurs then; however the point penalty never did occur on 22 Dec.
Proponents: ? I saw someone say this, can't remember who

3) In order for the deregistration to prevent the penalty, it must occur
before the penalty.  Thus, although he only announced his application to
rule 113 on 21 Jan, his deregistration occurred on 22 Dec.  Proponents:
Kelly, Chuck

4) Because 113 was originally written with FTF Nomic in mind, it simply
cannot apply if the penalty has already occurred; it may only apply if
the penalty has been dictated but has not occurred.  Thus Morendil's
message of 21 Jan was ineffective.  Proponents: Vanyel, Steve

Thus:
viewpoint	penalty cancelled?	dereg occurred?
    1		  Yes, on 22 Dec	      No
    2		  Yes, on 22 Dec	Yes, on 21 Jan
    3		  Yes, on 22 Dec	Yes, on 22 Dec
    4		       No		      No

Hope this helps...

Incidentally, from reading other mail, I believe Chess, Zefram, and
ex-Player elJefe also subscribe to this point of view.  Just FYI.

My example was to demonstrate Agora's relationship with RL.  But as for
your example... under *your* interpretation, what should happen now is
not only my retroactive deregistration, but *also* the retroactive
un-stealing of the $5.  This is physically impossible.  Rectification of
the problem might be possible--i.e., giving me back the $5--but you
cannot just say "You dereg?  Oh, well then you will find that the $5 is
still in your pocket, my pickpocketing of it having been causally
undone."  Can you see why I find this slightly ridiculous?

Favor suggested:

4c) Irrespectively of whether 113 can be retroactively applied or not: 
Because Morendil has stated he neither considered nor would have
considered the penalty worse than deregistration at the time it was
imposed, he cannot invoke 113 now, even if he has changed his mind.

Why are you telling them this?!  If they think we've already got quorum,
they'll send in their AGAINST votes.  We *need* those AGAINST votes...
We should probably just shut up and let them torpedo their own Quorum
scheme...

I hereby request to be registered as a player, with the name dcuman.

djc

NOTE: I have played Nomic before - I was a participant in Nomic
World. I am a founding player of AckaNomic, where I hold the
office of Pollster. I have been a subsciber to the various
Agora mailing lists for two weeks now and have been studying
the Logical Ruleset and the most excellent Guidebook.

I have attempted to join AgoraNomic before, but my preparations
were not adequate and I "fell off before I even found my footing".
I am determined not to repeat my previous mistakes.

You probably will not hear from me for a while as I try to become
even more familiar with the workings of this game. For the moment,
I will only vote on issues I am totally familiar with.

Also note that I have two email addresses:
     WORK: chapman@adtaz.sps.mot.com
     HOME: shodan@indirect.com

All the best,

djc

out of curiosity, i went thru the Ruleset and the archives and
determined who "owns" each Rule.  the "owner" of a Rule is defined as
the proposer of the most recent Proposal to successfully amend (null
amendments don't count) the Rule in question; if the Rule has not been
amended, the Proposer of the Proposal that created it is the owner.  i
didn't count mutations or transmutations because those don't change
the text of the Rule, nor did i count viral infections or Rule 750
amendments.  i didn't research the degree of the amendment, so
changing even one word in an old Rule gets the Proposer the ownership.

there are 228 Rules currently.  six survive from the Initial Ruleset
unamended (101, 103, 104, 107, 115, and 116), and are therefore not
owned at all.  of the remaining 222 Rules, the number owned by various
(ex-)Players are:

            cnt   pct  cumpct
Kelly        55  24.1    24.1
Swann        39  17.1    41.2

Stella?       1   0.4    96.9
Vlad          1   0.4    97.4

Initial Rules 6   2.6   100.0

Alexx has the distinction of the longest-lasting unamended Rule: Rule
404. 

what would be even more interesting is to compute each Player and
ex-Player's Rule-Days (the daily sum of the number of Rules owned by
each Player on each day), but i suspect that would be impossible due
to the many gaps in the record.

excising all multiculturally-less-than-sensitive terminology from the English

No, I hadn't noticed! But it's brilliant. I strongly suspect that both
meanings were intended, since the whole book is, in a sense, about the
regret that that one feels that one didn't act differently at some 
earlier time. This makes the name of the restaurant a fabulous, 
bilingual pun.

How could there be? Apart from the anonymous poster themsleves, you're

I hereby cast exactly two Votes FOR and no votes AGAINST
Proposal 2448. I understand that such a Move is without any legal
effect except to award me 4 EVs under the Rule created by Proposal
2448.

I hereby Call For Judgement on the following Statement :

The Rule that was created by Proposal 2448 should be interpreted so 
that a Transfer occurs under its provisions each time a Player casts 
the Votes it specifies, even if such Votes have no legal effect.

I bar Kelly, Steve and Vanyel.

Arguments : the relevant Rule mentions that these Transfers occur 
when the Player casts a Vote, not a _legal_ Vote. The other Rule in 
the Ruleset which calls for a transfer resulting from the casting of 
Votes on a Proposal is 312, which _does_ use the term "legal Vote".  

On the other hand, the Threat Wins Rule only says that the action of 
casting a particular number of Votes results in a transfer, though it 
specifies neither a limit to the time period during which such an 
action should be undertaken nor the time of occurrence of these 
transfers.

It is therefore my interpretation that Votes which are cast on 2448, 
even if they are not legal, may result in the transfer occurring at 
the time the message casting such Votes is sent.

No, this is a subtly different issue - that of whether a Rule saying 
"There exist N units of a Currency" at all attempts to create those 
units. I say it doesn't.

Protosal
#pragma Plato's Revenge

The following Rule shall be created:
      The Rules in the Agora Ruleset are also known as the Agoran Laws
      of Nature.  Collectively they define the realm of possible actions
      within the Game of Agora.  Nothing which is not explicitly or
      implicitly allowed by the Laws of Nature can possibly occur within
      the Game of Agora.

The following Rule shall be created:
      There exists a Subordinate Legal Code known as the Agora Code of
      Laws.  This Code applies to all Players, and it is possible but
      not permissible to violate any of the rules in the Code.
      Penalties for violation may be assessed by the Code.

The following Rule shall be created:
      For each of the numbers in the following list, the Rule with that
      number shall be Repealed, and a rule with identical text to the
      Repealed Rule shall be created within the Agora Code.

      {list of pragmatic rules}
(end)

Note, of course, that this Protosal doesn't even begin to cover all the
necessary legal ground for a switch of these proportions; for instance,
how will the SLC be numbered, what additional Rules or SLC rules will
need to be created to handle the system, etc., etc.  But it's an idea.

As a concept, I think I like this, for reasons totally aside from
why you'd do it.  I've been thinking of some convienient way to
break the Ruleset into two or more easily managable chunks, and this
would do so admiably. :)

Cannon once allowed a motion (to authorize the next census) to be
taken up even though it was not on the calendar because it was a
constitutional duty of the Congress to cause a census to be taken
every ten years.  an enterprising young representative latched onto
this exception to the House's standing rules about off-calendar
motions and demanded that his motion to amend the House's rules to
break the Speaker's iron grip on the calendar be taken up without
having been placed on the calendar on the grounds that the
Constitution also specifically calls for the House to make its own
rules.  he was successful, and the Speaker was thenceforth denied the
privilege to set the calendar unilaterally.

this same congressman went on to the Senate and filibustered that
august house for several days on the question of declarating war
against Germany.  he was successful in killing the question by
filibustering the Senate clear through to the end of the session.  of
course, in the next session, both houses promptly passed a declaration
of war, but it's the thought that counts...

i'm going entirely on memory here, from something i read back in 1985.
all errors my own.  i can't for the life of me remember his name,
although i think his first name was Edward.

I am now convinced that Melanie Rawn has, at some point, played Nomic.
:) Consider the following quote from her _Sunrunner's Fire_:

Rohan sighed.  "Think of the laws written the past seven Riall'im.  Very
few involve prohibitions of one sort or another.  They simply state what
will occur if a certain thing is done.  People do what they wish to do,
and saying it's not legal usually won't stop them.  But if the
consequences of a particular action are clear, they may do the thing
anyway, but they also know exactly what will happen if they're caught."

Shockingly pertinent, eh?

actually, in my case, it's due to the uncertainties caused by having
someone in your house who was forty weeks pregnant.

i had thought i had posted the report for last week, and if i missed
it it was more out of temporary stress than anything else.  the
stress-generating situation has been resolved (or, rather, replaced by
a situation which is somewhat less stressful--parents are never
completely free from stress) and i should be able to get everything
back in order within a few days.

hm, tie that in with Stark's "people always choose to do whatever

Faerie chess is an amusing albeit EXTREMELY complex variant of 3-D chess, 
in which pieces can be moved forward in time (appearing at a certain 
square some predetermined number of turns in the future) and backwards 
through time (involving the "gamestate" being reset to the point to which 
the moving piece returned).

Understand that the four or five years (in the late 70's/early 80's)
during which I was a member of a chess club that played this, I can't ever
remember a game between reasonably equivalent players ever being finished,
and we had to use a computer to keep track of the gamestate, but it *was*
fun... ;)

That would be neat.  Then, of course, we'd need to explain Nomic, and
Agora, and ... hm, wouldn't it be neat if she joined?  Then we'd have
_two_ authors in the game. :)  (You know, I really need to get a GEnie
account--that seems to be where all the good fantasy authors hang out.)

Heh heh heh.  That, or make Andry an Enemy of the Cabal... ;)  And
speaking of the Indiana legislature, I think we should declare the
Indiana Code to be an SLC. :)

I haven't been able to hang out on GEnie since I moved to Utah two years 
ago this month and cancelled my GEnie, Compuserve, and Delphi accounts 
because NONE of them have nodes local to where I live (nor does ANY major 
network or information service.  :P)  I miss Compuserve for the file 
libraries, and GEnie for the SFRT.

The Science Fiction RoundTable on GEnie is indeed where "all the good
fantasy authours hang out".  And many of the good s-f writers.  And four
(five?) major s-f/fantasy publishing companies and maybe a dozen magazines
have an official presence there.  And the "nearby" Horror Writers of
America RT has a lot of the good horror writers.   Of course, reading 
perhaps an eigth of what got posted to the SFRT and SFRT2 took me more 
time and bandwidth than all thre nomic lists and my top twenty or so 
newsgroups-of-interest take me now!  <lol!>

Durn, but I miss SFRT.  :(  You're not supposed to remind me of that. ;)

I've heard "Faerie chess" used to refer to any (and especially any
radical) variant of the basic game (although I'm a lousy player
myself, I have for the obvious reason an onlooker's interest in
the game and its history and culture).  Just swapping knight
and bishop probably doesn't count as Faerie, but sticking
Striders in front of the Knight's Pawns, or allowing secret
Battleship-like setting up of one's own side of the board before
the game, or etc like that, might well.

Just a linguistic note!

A new Group has just been formed, with the name "Pan-Agoran Anarchists'
League".  Its Vizier-Ordinancekeepor is Jtael, and the other initial
members are Ghost and Greycell.

An interesting note: 716 allows there to be more than three foundors.
But as soon as three foundors send me the Ords, the Group is formed.
Rather than assume that by listing more than three "initial members"
these three people can "draft" others into their group, I'll just decide
that when they specified Murphy as a fourth foundor it did nothing.
IOW, Murphy still has to join the group (by sending me and Jtael an
application, I presume.)

copyright law sorta ok, but am a total loss when it comes to the
european's "natural right" attitude toward intellectual property
rights.  especially the detail that, under the statutes in some
european countries, some authorship rights are legally inalienable; in
the US, all authorship rights are alienable.

for what it's worth, i believe that there is clearly an implied
license granting permission to both copy and use in derivatives the
various works of authorship that we Players routinely develop, to
whatever degree is necessary to play the Game.  i am not clear on what
the exact boundaries of that implied license are.

Agora itself cannot independently hold any of the copyrights because
it is an unincorporated association, and only persons (real or
fictitious) can possess copyrights.  for example, Chuck holds the
copyright on the Ruleset, which he produces (as a compiled work) under
the implied license i mentioned earlier.

it has, on occasion, occured to me to charter a 501(c)(3) (tax-exempt)
corporation that could legally own Agora's IP.  such an entity could
also serve to further the various interests of Agora Nomic, and its
Players, in the real world.

May I take it then that you take it in turns to acts as sort of executive
officer of the week - but all the decisions of that officer have to be
ratified at a special bi-weekly meeting by a simple majority in the case
of purely internal matters, but by a two-thirds majority in the case
of more major -

Hm.  I do remember seeing them, but I simply cannot find them anywhere.
The Assessor's report on them says their VP commenced at 9 Jan, but I
can't find mention of them in the log for 9 Jan.  Perhaps Coren could
help?  (As a side note, simply specifying "the Christmas Proposals"
probably wasn't enough to active our good frien Foia anyway.)

Tis taking it away from rampant platonism again, but in this case, perhaps
appropriately so.  There are two things in the game which are completely,
uncontrollably pragmatic, and no amount of rule shuffling is going to
alleviate that - that is the actual medium it is played in (mailing lists,
software, the physical computers), and the players and their interface to
the percieved "Players".

This brings to mind something that this pragmatic vs platonic thread has 
had percolating in the back of my head for a long time, however: the 
possibility of legistlating this dichotomy between the physical person 
who is reading email and thinking, and the Nomic Entity who the other 
Players percieve.  To borrow from roleplaying, it is not necessarily a 
given that the "player" (physical person) and the "character" (nomic 
entity) should be treated as a single, inseperable unit.  The main theme 
of this platonism movement has been the fact, completely correct, that 
one cannot force the physical Player to do anything; one can only deal 
with the results of his having done or not done something.

If one were to define the player and the character as two different
things, the only thing which needs to be handled pragmatically is the
actual interface between the two of them, which should involve as little
actual contact as is possible while still allowing the player control over
his character.  At that point, if the Rules of the game refer only to 
this *character*, they become platonic inherently, because although you 
cannot force a player to do anything, you can certainly force a character 
to.  (This is not necessarily desireable, but it is possible).

At that point, the Rules pertaining to the actions of characters fall 
naturally into two catagories:  what have been being called the 
"platonic" rules become the "social laws" of the Agoraverse, while the 
previously less-desireable "pragmatic" rules become in effect then 
"physical laws" of the Agoraverse:  they happen because that is the way 
things work, not because of any voluntary act.

This doesn't mean that the social isn't more desireable than the 
physical; defining rules in such a way can and will result circumstances 
where something *did* happen, but was not detected.  It could be useful, 
however, in distancing the pragmatic, physical reality of the "Real 
World" from the shared hallucination / concensus reality of "the Game", 
which is something which many people seem to regard as a Good Thing (tm).

Think about it.  Comments are appreciated; a proto will be forthcoming if 
anyone is interested.

"Tasmania's anti-gay laws"? I hadn't heard about this.

I live in a state where use of the word gay results in the locals bringing
out the branding irons, hot tar, feathers, and railroad ties (I believe
the locally correct term is "those d*mn f*gs") and in which the school
board of its most populous county just shut down EVERY "non-academic" high
school club in the district so they wouldn't be legally required to allow
a gay-lesbian-straight support club on two high school campuses, and in
which the state legislature is currently discussing (and probably will
pass) a law calling for the unconditional dismissal and prosecution of any
teacher "condoning illegal activities" - you can read this as "openly
discussing illegal activities, such as male-male sexual relations" (which
are still illegal in this state)... this is what the writers of the bill
have publically stated its intent is.  Bleargh. 

Trying to legislate controls on private consentual activities of any sort 
is te ultimate in "pragmatic" legislative idiocy, no matter what ones 
personal views on "moral" issues involved is.  :P

Coren votes for Tasmania and Utah becoming Enemies of the Cabal.  ;)

More Nomics are cropping up on the Net.  One, located in
http://crypto2.uwaterloo.ca/~mfare/nomic/, is the 
Net Waste of Time Nomic.  NWOTN has asked experienced players
to stay out  --- this game is for novices.  Below is one of
their recent proposals

___________________________________
Proposal 315

Proposed by: Andrew 

Submission date: Wed Feb 28 12:32:03 UTC 1996 

Distribution date: Wed Feb 28 19:08:23 UTC 1996 

For the purposes of voting, the symbol :-) shall 
be equivalent to "FOR"; the symbol :-( shall be
equivalent to "AGAINST". For Judgement, <:-] 
shall be equivalent to "TRUE", <:-[ shall be 
equivalent to "FALSE", while <|-? shall be 
equivalent to "UNDECIDED". 

[Comment:] Nothing compels any player to use
the symbols above. All it says is that these are legal 
sybols for the voting reactions. It allows a player
with a sense of humour to be creative; at least these
symbols are mnemonic. I considered things like 
%#$@. No, I don't take any funny chemicals while
playing newt. 
____________________________________

Another Web Nomic is based in Japan, at
http://soc-gw.soc.titech.ac.jp:8080/nomic/  
looks interesting.... or at least it would if I
could read the rules.

There is a Polish game at
http://www.byd.ternet.pl/labirynt/nomic/nomic.htm
--- but I think this game is dead.

Finally, I've seen a Web site for a Face-to-face
Nomic club,called The Lisgar Nomic Club, at 
http://www.lisgar.edu.on.ca/clubs/nomic/index.html.

Now, should we try to assimilate any of these?  I 
think NWOTN is practically _asking_ for it :)

I found the body at http://www-hons-cs.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~cac/Nomic/Nomic.html.
Apparently, the players never approved any proposals and got
tired of their collective obstinacy.

Anyway, some of the Nomic World survivors may be interested
in knowing a couple of these Nomic pages refer to the game as
"Nomic World" (see the"Present Ruleset" for example).  If this
game weren't already _dead_, I'd be tempted to sue for libel.
I knew NW.  It was my friend.  And let me tell you--- this was no
Nomic World! (apologies to --uh what's his name--- former Sen.
Bentsen, who used similar language to attack VP candidate
Dan Quayle)

Anyway, I thought you all might find this interesting.

Rule 1499 was repealed by Proposal 2461.
Rule 893 was repealed by Proposal 2491.

neither Proposal 2505 nor Proposal 2509 had any legal effect.

Part of what makes this difficult is that there are a few cases where,
through evolution or deliberate misuse, an Agoran Word has taken a
different meaning from the same word in RL.  And making things even more
difficult, not everyone agrees on what happens with them.  When As Soon
As Possible took on a legal meaning, some said that this was in addition
to its RL meaning (just to make things enforceable), but some say it
replaced the RL meaning.  Mostly, though, we have cases of a word that
could mean several things, and a low-MI rule narrowed it (i.e. a Nomic
Week is one that starts at midnight Monday, a Group is a specific
mutually exclusive group of players, with certain qualifications).
However, I still contend that *if* we amended the MI=1 Nomic Week rule
to say "Nomic Weeks start midnight the 1st, 11th, and 21st of every
month", it would still have all the effects we expected of it, even
though the Nomic Week would no longer be, strictly speaking, a week.

On the other hand, it would clearly be undesirable to pass a low-MI rule
which said that "pieces of text numbered greater than 300 in the ruleset
are not Rules, but Laws." (This would make them not fall under the Rule
Change rule.)  So I think this is yet another of those cases where we
must use "common sense" to dictate where it is allowed, and where it
isn't.  Fortunately, because we now have a pretty decent judicial
system (and especially with precedent law), we can get away with rules
which base part of their effectiveness on common sense or being
"reasonable".  (For instance, I did this with my most recent version of
the Randomness law, relying primarily on case law to determine valid and
invalid means of determination.)

I intend to continue the "Guidelines for Judging" program which I started
a year ago; this is simply to send explicit instructions to any player
who is judging for the first time.  Please review the following proposed
"Guidelines" and post any significant errors or omissions that you find
to nomic-b or nomic-d.

Thanks!


=====================================================================
                     GUIDELINES FOR JUDGING
=====================================================================

These instructions are meant to be helpful to newly-assigned Judges 
who have not judged before, or at least not recently.  It's not a
tutorial on the Rules, just a guide to the specific rules about judging.

You may have been assigned as Judge in a Call for Judgement (CFJ). This 
has happened not by your request or choice, but by random selection from
among eligible players.

If you believe you are not eligible under Rule 698, you should contact 
the Clerk of the Courts (CotC) immediately.


What happens now
================

Assuming you have been properly assigned as Judge of the CFJ, you may 
decline to judge (at a cost of 2 points) by notifying the CotC, in which 
case another Judge will be assigned.

Or you may deliver judgement within seven days.  Even new players are 
encouraged to do this rather than decline. If you do so, you will 
receive 3 points for judging.


How to Judge
============

To deliver judgement you must decide the truth of the Statement in the 
CFJ.  You may consider the arguments put forth by the Caller. You may 
consider arguments made in the Public Forum by other players, or 
discuss the case offline via email. You are encouraged to investigate 
the Agora records, or make requests to Officers for additional evidence 
which you may need to make a determination.

Your final judgement must be TRUE or FALSE.  In cases where the statement
is logically neither true nor false (e.g. "this statement is false"), or is 
irrelevant to Agora Nomic (e.g. "Pepsi is just as good as Coke"), or is not 
allowed as a CFJ statement by the Rules (e.g. Rule 1431), you must Dismiss 
the CFJ.

Additionally, you may Dismiss the CFJ if there is not sufficient information
to decide it. You must make a reasonable effort to find all information 
necessary to make a decision, before dismissing for this reason.  Statements 
about the current state of the game are judged TRUE or FALSE according to 
the state at the time the CFJ was issued. (Rules 591 and 451)

You're also encouraged to provide reasons and arguments for your judgement.
These will not form part of the Judgement, but should give your reasons 
for the judgement and will be published with it.

The reasons and arguments can include citations of deciding Rules, past 
Judgements, and game custom.  The Rules are paramount; however, "if the 
if the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the Statement to 
be Judged, then the Judge shall consider game custom, commonsense, past 
Judgements, and the best interests of the game before applying other 
standards." (Rule 217)

Send your Judgement (TRUE or FALSE) or Dismissal together with your reasons 
and arguments via e-mail directly to the CotC. Also include copies of any 
evidence you considered which was not part of the  original CFJ.


Injunctions
===========

A CFJ may include a request for an Injunction.  Injunctions are very
powerful tools and should be used with caution.  If an injunction is
requested with the CFJ, and you judge TRUE, then you should indicate
in your judgement whether you grant an Injunction, and what it is.

Injunctions may only be issued when allowed by the rules.  Currently
there are three forms of injunction:

If a TRUE CFJ says that a Rule should be interpreted in a certain way,
  an injunction may order the Rulekeepor to annotate the Rule with the 
  statement of the CFJ. (Rule 789)

If a TRUE CFJ says that a player broke a Rule, an injunction may be 
  issued indicating the Prescribed Words to be used in that player's 
  Formal Apology. (Rule 908)

For details of these injunctions, consult the relevant rules directly.

You as judge always have the option to refuse the injunction. Then the 
relevant Officers will need to use their judgement in how to apply the 
Judgement in determining the correct Game State.

Be careful.  The majority of Public Apologies have stemmed from issuing
Injunctions which were later determined to be illegal.


What happens after submitting judgement
=======================================

When you deliver judgement, the CotC will publish the Judgement as soon 
as possible.  If your judgement is well-reasoned and correct, it will 
earn the praise of the Agora community, in addition to the points you 
receive for judging.

However, if three players disagree with you, they may appeal the Judge-
ment.  This does not concern the original Judge directly; it will be 
decided by the Justices of Agora.  If they overrule the original Judge-
ment then you have to give back the points you got for judging.


In summary
==========

You're the Judge.

If you don't decline to serve, you should submit your judgement of TRUE or 
FALSE, or Dismissal, with reasons, to the CotC by e-mail within 7 days.
Don't be late!

The CotC's e-mail is currently "jlc@triple-i.com".

The judgement must be strictly according to the Rules, but if the Rules 
are silent you may consider other standards.

If the CFJ itself does not contain sufficient evidence, you must attempt to 
gather additional evidence yourself and not Dismiss solely on that basis.

Just do your best.  All of Agora wishes you well in your efforts.

Note that this is probably the last message I'll be sending to the
listserv, as we are now unsubscribed, but I wanted to respond a bit to
Steve's comments for no particular reason. 

I've made a few sacrifices in order to be able to play this game, mostly
due to the time contraints I'm under. I thought it would be worth it.
Unfortunately, the game has changed a lot since the last time I was
active, and I don't think it's for the better. Everything is far more
serious, far more tedious, and far more complex. This makes it far less
fun, at least for me. 

Therefore, since it's not fun, there is little point in being involved
at all. Although the recent Registrar thing was a part of my decision,
it served mainly to make me re-examine my participation and decide if I
really did want to play. 

Incidentally, I did post the most recent Registrar's Report shortly
after deregistering and hopefully it will be distributed okay. Speaker
favor, if you don't get it, I can resend it to you. Just let me know. In
a few days, I'll be deleting it, so please let me know soon if there are
any problems. Otherwise you get to find out just how much fun it is to
catch up on someone else's work. Perhaps Steve won't give you quite as
hard a time, though....

     I have completed my study, Sir. It appears that in order to make the
      military less appealing to lesbians and gay men, we must make some
   modifications, such as eliminating the following: Polished black leather
     boots, all belts, buckles, straps and uniforms generally, all short
	crewcuts and all fit, healthy, lithe young men and women, Sir.

   The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed
   ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function.
   One should, for example, be able to see that things are hopeless and yet
	be determined to make them otherwise.  -- F. Scott Fitzgerald

Ah, the Judges' Guide.  Hopefully it met with approval the last time 
I published it.  I think Vanyel can send it on request, and I can also,
and I try to send it to any Judge who hasn't judged recently (or ever).
Unfortunately I can't set up web pages at my company just now. Perhaps
Vanyel would like to add it to his excellent Archives page 
(http://www.quincy.edu/~blahedo/agora/).

I have a few concerns I'd like to raise about the current arrangements
which KoJen has made to use Michael's email account. These have nothing
to do with this particular arrangement. Rather, they are concerns about
the general idea of distinct Players sharing a single email account.
Basically my concerns are about authentication of messages.

First of all it's worth noting that this is the first time, to my
knowledge, that such an arrangement has been made. In the past, we
have had many instances of single Players using multiple email
addresses, which is unproblematical, and a few cases of 'collective
identity' (Deb and Bob, Xanadu) in which multiple persons have been
registered as a single Player, using either single or multiple
email addresses, which cases were not without their difficulties.
But this situation, in which distinct Players are sharing a single
email address, has never, to my knowledge, arisen before. It's not
surprising, then, that we have no legislation to deal with it. It
is the purpose of this message to initiate a debate about whether
legislation to simply ban the practice, by requiring that distinct
Players have distinct email addresses, is desirable.

My concerns, as I say, are about authentication. This morning, for
example, I received votes in the Justiciar Election from Michael
and from KoJen. Both these messages originated from Michael's
address, and they were distinguished only by the fact that one
of them claimed to be from Michael and the other from KoJen. Now,
I'm not especially worried about this particular case. KoJen
and Michael are both long time Players in good standing, and KoJen
specifically informed us in advance of his arrangement, and I have
no reason to doubt his word. But that's because I know KoJen and
Michael. But it nevertheless remains true that if KoJen were
to take a week off without leaving instructions about his voting
intentions, and if Michael were to use this opportunity to vote
on KoJen's behalf, then the Assessor or Registrar would have
absolutely no way of telling the difference. And this seems to
me the kind of thing we should prohibit on policy grounds.

Reactions?

The difference is, elJefe actually did not receive the mail, whereas you
received the mail but lost it before you could read it.  If a piece of
mail is delivered to me, have I received it?  Yes, even if I haven't
opened and read it.  Of course, this may still mean there is a problem
with rule 683 which requires amendment, I'm not sure.

CFJ 707 was one of the first CFJs I judged, back in October 1994; a side
issue in the CFJ was ordering of events.  I judged that the best (most
impartial) way of deciding exact timing was to use Teleport's time.  The
relevant paragraphs follow:
        So we see that if we take the Time/Date Sent, Chuck's posting
  of the Ruleset will have beaten Steve's post by over 3 hours.  However,
  if we take the Time/Date Recd (by Kelly, for that's who sent me the
  files), Steve's post was first.  Kelly has pointed out that her
  service is unreliable for timing; we can see through Chuck's second
  posting that it took the mail about a half hour to get there.  And
  her point that we cannot count on the "Received" datestamps are
  well taken; if this were the case, different Rules would at times
  apply to different people.  This is clearly unacceptable.
        Yet, if we take the "Date" (ie Time Sent) datestamps, then
  we can also have problems; what if the posting got lost or delayed on
  its way to the listserver?  Clearly, the Players of Agora cannot be
  expected to follow Rules they never received.  Yet we also cannot count
  on individual Players Receiving posts at certain times.  Thus, I am
  forced to conclude that the best possible time to reckon by is the
  latest time which applies to all of Agora: the time when the listserver
  (at this time, nomic-discussion@teleport.com) receives the post.
  Reckoning in this manner, Steve's change-of-vote occurred almost
  five hours before the posting of results of the Grey Repeals by Chuck.

The full text of the CFJ can be accessed from the Archives (on the Web,
anyway; in reorganizing files I managed to break the CFJ part of my mail
server.  I'll fix it soon, but in the meantime just mail me direct to
request a CFJ.)

> litigation.

I agree.

First comment: Although we try to allow for a lot, Agora still relies on
the goodwill of its Players to not break it.  While scamming is actually
sanctioned, outright lying is generally frowned upon.  (Must I bring out
the FRC's "legal, winning, and No Fun" argument again?)

Second comment: Perhaps, however, to partially fix this problem, we
could have one or two Players who could verify time of receipt?  In
other words, be able to cc important stuff to them, have them be quiet
about it until and unless you ask them to verify that you sent it?
I'd love to call them Notaries, but the Office of Notary has sort of
evolved away from the verification duty into the recordkeepor duty...

As I'm suddenly swamped, the current Wizard wishes to cease being Wizard
In fact, if memory serves, this probably should have happened about the
time of Kelly's win.

However, that dely shouldn't affect this, it simply means that this is now my
only legal act as Wizard that I can perform.


As per Rule 1609, I hereby initate a Wizard Transition.

The Transition List in order of Style (ties randomly ordered):

Kelly         2
elJefe        1

and all players of zero Style (not on Hold and in Random order):

Coren
favor
Blob
Zefram
Michael
Narcisse
Andre
Jtael
Doug
Morendil
Oerjan
KoJen
Chuck
Vanyel
Steve
Murphy

As per Rule 1609, Kelly is now the Wizard, with the option to decline
as per 1610, in which case elJefe becomes Wizard, and so on down this list.

Again, apologies for being so messy about all this,

Swann

Player KoJen has not, to the best of my knowledge, sent a message to 
the Public Forum in the fourteen-day period preceding this message.
Further, I am led to believe that e has not sent to any Player a

period.

H. Registrar, please be so kind as to confirm my belief that Player 
KoJen might be deregistered as of this message.

============================================================
PROPOSALS MERITING STYLE CHANGES, WITH VALUES OF AND REASONS FOR

Proposal 2583 (Andre, AI=1)
2 votes is enough

    Simple, uncomplicated destruction of Powers, with no reasons given.
    Boring.  (-1 Style Point)

============================================================
Proposal 2584 (favor, AI=1)
Clarify 1446

    Trivial but good fix, perhaps more necessary than even the 
    author realizes. (+1 Style Point)
    
============================================================
Proposal 2585 (Morendil, AI=1)
Less Secrecy in Referenda

    No reasons given.  A worthwhile fix, though it doesn't 
    go far enough, IMHO.  (+1 Style Point)

============================================================
Proposal 2588 (Steve, AI=1)
Prohibit Electioneering by Vote Collectors

    Attempts to be more comprehensive than Prop. 2855, but fails
    because if successful Rule 452 and Rule 1434 will not be in
    conflict but will simply prohibit things to a different 
    extent.  It does not even say that revealing who voted is
    actually legal, merely that it does not violate 452.
    (+1 Style Points)

============================================================
Proposal 2589 (Morendil, AI=1)
The Power of Many Fates

    This is so interesting and creative I'd give it +3 except
    for its major flaw.  It creates a fascinating new Power, and 
    suitably warps our notion of Nomic probability.  It remembers 
    to contain a precedence clause, so it has a chance of being
    effective.

    HOWEVER, any application of it will result in a CFJ because of 
    the phrasing   "_Whenever_ Destiny's Toy is required to make a 
    random choice, e shall in addition _randomly_ select a number 
    from 1 to 6 ..."  Also, "2" is missing from the outcomes table.
    (+2 Style Points)

============================================================
Proposal 2590 (Kelly, AI=1)
Legal Votes

    I like platonization.  I like resolving things that I worried 
    about as Speaker and Assessor, namely whether the Assessor is 
    allowed to confirm a vote back to its sender, or to pass intermediate
    results to eir successor, or how exactly is a vote "cast".  The 
    reasons given are clear and convincing.  (+2 Style Points)

A legal and correct announcement of a Game end having occurred, I hereby 
announce the initiation of a Wizard Transition.

The attached Transition List is the list of all other Players not On Hold,
in descending order of Style.  The ties between favor and Steve, and among
the players with 0 S.P., were broken by coin flips.

Player     Style
--------   -----
Kelly        4
Morendil     3
favor        1
Steve        1
Jtael        0
Chuck        0

Oerjan       0
Murphy       0
Michael      0
dcuman       0

Kelly becomes Wizard as of this message.  If she declines within 72 hours,
then Morendil becomes Wizard.  And so on.

"BethMo becomes a Watcher"...

I'm curious as to when I was removed from the Watcher list.
I don't usually read the Registrar's Report, but I (apparently
mistakenly) thought that I'd been a Watcher since the category
was first added to the list, lo these many moons ago.  Would
the Archivist mind looking up when, and why, my name was
dropped?  (Maybe it happened in whichever round of
Chromatic Repeals removed the Patent Title of Agoraphobe?)

H. Archivist, would you be so kind as to send me a copy of the Rule defining
this Patent Title (in the form they had at the time of their Repeal)?

The way *I* see it is this: as long as a message *at some point* passes
through a Player's normal technical domain of control, and has
verifiably not been altered since then, it can be considered to be from
that player.  By "normal technical domain", in this case, I mean a
domain which *only* that Player has access to (normally, i.e. excluding
sysop interventions and the like).  The word "verifiably" might be
changed to "certifiably", but I'm not exactly sure about that.

The point is, if a message passes through a player's account via an
autobouncer, and that message contains something the player didn't
really want to do, well then that's their own damn fault.

I wish to register as a Player, with the name KoJen. My address is
cogen@ll.mit.edu. 

The following services are for lease, for a period from now until the end of
June 8, 1996, GMT:

1) Voting: Send me your requests. I will Vote as you wish.

2) Judging: If I am picked as a Judge, send me your judgements. I will Vote as
you wish.

3) Powers and Spending Authority: Send me your Powers requests (purchasing,
casting). I will do as you wish. Send me your spending requests (Points to
Marks/Whatever, spending of Marks, etc.) I will honor them if permissible.


All other attributes will be controlled by David Cogen until otherwise
stated. The above leases may be renewed or reassigned at the end of the initial
lease period.


The details:

All actions will be made by the person David Cogen. You just tell me what you
want me to do. I promise to do what you wish, for the stated lease period, as
long as the request is within the attribute covered by the lease. I will
endeavor to honor all requests, and I check my mail fairly regularly, but any
failures to do so are an accidental and regretable mistake, the possibility of
such cannot be eliminated entirely.


I will choose leaseholders very soon, maybe today, certainly within one
week. To obtain a lease, send me a message ASAP telling me why you want
it. And, a monetary pledge would be most helpful. I will choose the
leaseholders as I see fit, by a public announcement (or private if you wish),
upon transfer of the pledged currencies. Note that if you purchase attribute
#3, then any money you pledge would remain under your control!

Ooh, you said it!  Oh, *I* said it!  Ooh, I said it again!

I think you need to be more specific on how much of the text has to be
displayed for it to be an Infraction...

Also, according to the above, such Infractions can't be reported.

Hmm. Right. 'quoting any part of its text' should be safe, though. 
You can't quote involuntarily, can you ?

> Also, according to the above, such Infractions can't be reported.

Yes they can. "Player Vanyel has Done It Again. That's 1 Mark less
for Player Vanyel, teach em to Mention the Unmentionable !" Who said
the report of an Infraction had to be explicit about the nature of
the Infraction ?

Of course, when new Players join in, we can expect CFJs to fly when 
such Infractions are reported...

Note that in Acka, the Invisible Rule Proposal _did_ pass - but they 
also eradicated all traces of the Proposal itself.

I'm having a little semantic difficulty with the word 'display'. A
closer alternative is 'quote'. What I intended this to mean is, it's
illegal to refer to the Rule, in whole or in part, by number, title
or text. (Of course this does not preclude euphemisms such as
'_that_ Rule, you know the one I'm talking about', or somesuch, but
that would be part of the fun.)

Hmmm, I don't think we saw that message, otherwise you now would be a
Player. I suggest you try again.

Other than that, just make sure you're subscribed to all the lists,
including the Backup List.

As Registrar, it's my job to load up the Welcome Wagon. So, let me start
by saying: Welcome to Agora!

I saw a message from him (I think it appeared to be addressed to me personally,
rather than to n-d or any part of the PF) and sent him a fair amount of
information - didn't get any reply.

I thought Coren was the list-owner...how could Murphy have ended up
with the job?

Actually, in my first email, I said to call me Eric, but no one seems to 
have seen that.

Sorry... this is frustrating... when I first subscribed to the mailing 
lists, all I got was a deluge of mail... no real answers as to how to get 
involved.  thanks for the help by the way...

Kelly asks:
> why is Murphy listowner?

More interestingly, *how* is Murphy listowner?  When I was Distributor,
Coren tried to make me list manager so I'd get all the bounce messages
and such, but he was unable to do so.  I couldn't even be
*co*-listowner, because apparently list administration has to be done by
someone at teleport.com.

has Sean formally registered yet?  i haven't seen anything arrive on
nomic-business or nomic-official that would imply that he has.

it's entirely possible that all the discussion surrounding his attempt
to register has not been seen by him by the virtue of his not being
subscribed to the proper lists.  perhaps the Distributor should
explain this requirement to him.

As it is, the only motivation I can see for voting FOR it
("do something silly") probably isn't strong enough to
motivate me.  How about giving it some interesting
substantial content?  Nothing springs to mind immediately;
perhaps something like giving 1 EV per month to every
Player who was registered at the time that the Proposal
passed?  Then there'd be all these mysterious EVs
appearing, and us old-timers would have to use amusing
circumlocutions to explain it to the newer people!   *8)

Actually, over in Acka, that "Rule" specifies a Point bonus for the
_first_ time a new Player refers to it, with subsequent mentions
earning em a penalty.

Leaving aside the Patently Silly aspect of it, though, it's really 
interesting to consider the extent to which such a Rule could be 
effective; at least as much as actually enacting it would be, with or 
without an added mechanism to tie it in with game play.

I don't see why it wouldn't be effective.  The Proposed Rule doesn't forbid
its being quoted in whole or in part in private messages between Players, does
it?  (IMO it very definitely shouldn't.)  So if some new Player questions it
and can't be convinced any other way, we simply send a copy of it to them
privately.

What happens if a Rule with MI>1, with a number of, say, 2000,
states 'This Rule takes precedence over all Rules with the same MI, 
any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding' ?

If another Rule of the same MI, even with a lower number, claims to
take precedence over it, will it fail to do so ? Apparently, the
second precedence clause in the above lets Rule 2000 override the
MI=1 Rule 1030, so Rule 2000 would not be subject to the usual
precedence-resolution mechanism.

Or imagine a Rule 3000, with MI=3, stating "This Rule takes
precedence over Rule 1482. This Rule takes precedence over Rule
1030. This Rule takes precedence over all MI=3 Rules, but defers to 
any Rule with lower MI." 

Apparently Rule 1030 states that this Rule can take precedence over
1482, and so override 1482. And of course since this Rule is MI=3 it
can also override 1030. Therefore any MI=3 Rule can theoretically
define its own precedence mechanism, which lets it, for instance,
override any other Rule.

Or have I missed something ?

Now we're heading into tricky territory. Is the phrase "any Rule to
the contrary notwithstanding" in the above supposed to be functioning
as a *third*-order provision, for resolving conflicts between second-
order provisions? It's never been clear to me whether we really do
allow, or ought to allow, this kind of thing. Perhaps we ought to
terminate the potentially infinite hierarchy of higher-order precedence
claims at level two?

Let's try and have a clear example before us. So:

R1900, MI=2: X happens. This Rule takes precedence over all other Rules.
R2000, MI=2: X doesn't happen. This Rule takes precedence over all MI=2
             Rules, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

Now, R1030 imposes the numerical method when the Rules claim precedence
over each other (as here), which would have R1900 winning out. But
R2000 claims precedence, "any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding",
including presumably, R1030 - so there is a conflict, which R2000 wins
in virtue of higher precedence. So I agree with your analysis.

Is that an argument for upmutating R1030? I'm not sure...I need to think
about it some more...

Unless 2000 makes some other claim about Rule precedence, I don't think
it conflicts with 1030 (which is not a Rule with the same MI).  1030
doesn't say "I win over 2000", but rather "Rule X wins over 2000", and
2000 doesn't win a conflict with 1030 because there isn't one.

> Or imagine a Rule 3000, with MI=3, stating "This Rule takes

This would be the Mystery Science Theater Rule.  And would need "except
Rule 1030" tacked onto the last sentence to avoid self-contradiction.

Since 1482 doesn't claim precedence over anything else, and neither 1482
nor 1030 make any other attempt to maintain themselves at the top of the
precedence heap, it looks like an MI=3 Rule can indeed override them both.

By virtue of higher MI, actually, but yes, it wins.  Bah, there *is* a
2000 vs 1030 conflict after all.  Lord only knows how I missed it.

in case anyone is interested, Agora's Ruleset (a much older document)
is 271318 bytes in size as a text file (this includes a smallish email
header); it is 40,746 words (and 7217 lines) in length.  i have no
idea how many pages it is typeset as i don't have any word processors
on my system.  line printed (60 lines/page) it would be 121 pages.
approximately 1/3 of the published ruleset is not actually rule text.

Agora have 262 Rules.

Laurent> Are you sure ? This from the latest Tabulator's Report :

Laurent> Mon, 27 May 1996 00:00:00: Risk! Chuck loses 3 points. 

the reporting here is wrong, unless Jtael actually made the report at
00:00 UTC.  the risk penalty takes place at the time it's reported,
not at the start of the NW.

in any case, what about the NW starting 3 Jun 1996?  it's nearly over,
and i haven't seen a risk report (or, for that matter, a tabulator's
report).

if it appears _after_ the report of tokens, it's an illegal report:
rule 1624 requires that the report of risk penalty be no later than
the tabulator's report; if the report of the penalty is in the same
message but after the report, it's infinitesimally later.

If there is one person with the greatest number of win tokens who is

If there is one person with the greatest number of Win Tokens who is
a member of the Threat, I take three Tokens from that Player and destroy
them.

If either of the above transfers deal with a tie, I do the following:

I take the player (the target player), not myself, who has the second-greatest
non-zero amount of tokens (first in alphabetical order in case of a tie) and do
 one of the following:

i) if a player with the greatest tokens is a member of the threat and this
   target player is not, I give three win tokens to the target player

ii) If this target player and a player with the greatest tokens is a member of
    threat, I remove a token from each member of the threat in alphabetical
    order until I run out of transfers

iii) If no player with the greatest tokens is a member of the threat, I

Ok, I've got my account sorted out for now; I just resubscribed to my
various lists, including these four (there *are* still just four,
right?).  I perform the following actions:

I hereby Register as a Player in Agora, or on the off chance that I
wasn't dereg'ed, I now become Active.

I request that the Registrar send me a current listing of Players,
Officers, etc.

I request that the Promotor send me a copy of all Proposals currently up
for vote.

(I have the ruleset from a couple days ago, so I don't need that)

I request that the Internomic rep (Liaison?) send me current info on
Internomic, assuming that got off the ground (it was close when I left).

And, finally, I unofficially request someone (or several people) to send
me a synopsis of anything interesting that has happened in the past two
months. :)

The Proposals on which currently an internal Referendum is due (or has
it just finished?) are the following:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 303
Proposed by Ackanomic

--------

Amend Rule 215 to read:

The voting members in this Nomic are: AckaNomic, Agora, Thring and Imperial
Nomic 14 and Imperial Nomic 18.  There are no nonvoting members.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 304
Proposed by Ackanomic

--------

A nomic game may become a member of internomic by submitting a request to
the moderator.

A valid request must include the name of the nomic game, the name of it's
liason, an email adress for the liason, and whether the nomic game wishes
to enter as a voting or nonvoting member.

The moderator may deny entry to any nomic game he does not feel is qualified.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 305
Proposed by Ackanomic

--------

Amend the rule intially numbered as Rule 215 to read:

It is the duty of the moderator to maintain a list of all voting and
nonvoting member nomics.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Agora has voted AGAINST 301 and 302; all Agorans who voted on the
Referenda were FOR, but it didn't make Quorum...

======================================================================

The Internomic Ruleset is:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Immutable Rules

101.  All member nomics must always abide by all Internomic rules then
      in effect, in the form in which they are then in effect.  At the
      start of the first game, rules 101-114 are immutable, and rules
      201-216 are mutable.  Subsequently, the number of a rule does not
      indicate that rule's mutability.

102.  A nomic is a game in which the rules are changeable by those who
      play it.  The entities which play this nomic, aka "Internomic",
      are themselves nomics, aka "member nomics".  Every member nomic
      shall be either a voting member or a nonvoting member.  References
      in this ruleset to "nomics" or "members" shall mean member nomics,
      and shall include both voting and nonvoting members, unless
      otherwise noted.  References in the ruleset to "rules" shall mean
      Internomic rules, unless otherwise noted.

103.  At any time, there shall be exactly one moderator, who must be a
      player of at least one member nomic.  The moderator may not
      resign.  If the moderator is no longer a player in any member
      nomic, e must name a successor who is.  Once this is done, the
      successor replaces the moderator.

104.  The moderator for the first game shall be Andre.

105.  Every member nomic shall have a liaison at all times.  The liaison
      must be an entity registered as a player of that nomic.

106.  A rule change is the enactment, repeal, or amendment of a mutable
      rule, or the transmutation of an immutable rule into a mutable
      rule or vice versa.

107.  Every proposal shall be numbered by the moderator.  The numbers
      shall begin with 301, and each proposal shall receive the next
      successive integer.

108.  Every proposal shall be communicated to all voting members before
      it is voted on.  If adopted, it shall take effect in the form in
      which it was voted on.

109.  All proposals shall be voted on.  They will be adopted if and only if
      they receive the required number of votes.

110.  A proposal containing a transmutation rule change is adopted if
      and only if all votes on that proposal are in favor.
      Transmutation may not be implied, but must be stated explicitly.

111.  An immutable rule always takes precedence over a mutable rule.  If
      there is a conflict between the two, the mutable rule is entirely
      void.

112.  A member nomic may always withdraw from Internomic.

113.  It must never become completely impermissible to change rules.

114.  Whatever is not forbidden is allowed, except that changing the
      rules is only permitted when another rule allows it.
 
 
Mutable rules

201.  All members begin with 0 points. 

202.  The game ends when a nomic achieves 100 points.  The winner is the
      first nomic to do so.  The liaison from that nomic becomes
      moderator, and all scores are reset to 0.  A new game is then
      begun, with all rules and proposals retaining the status they had
      at the end of the game.  The nomic that won must appoint a new
      liaison.

203.  A proposal is made by submitting it to the moderator.  All members
      may make proposals.  Upon receiving the proposal, the moderator
      shall assign it a number and distribute it to all nomics.

204.  Every proposal shall contain exactly one rule change.

205.  The voting period for a proposal shall be four weeks, beginning at
      the time the moderator distributes the proposal to all nomics.

206.  Each voting member may vote exactly once per proposal.  Nonvoting
      members may not vote.

207.  Voting members may vote either for or against any proposal by
      sending their vote to the moderator by the end of the voting period
      on that proposal.  The moderator may not reveal any votes until the
      end of the voting period.  Any voting member who does not vote has
      abstained.

208.  At the end of the voting period of a proposal, the moderator shall
      reveal all votes legally cast on that proposal.  If required, the
      moderator should indicate eir consent (or lack thereof) at this
      time.  If the moderator does not indicate eir opinion, it shall be
      assumed that e consents.

209.  A proposal passes if and only if all votes cast on it are in
      favor.

210.  A rule change takes effect at the moment the proposal containing
      it is adopted.  The rule which is changed takes the number of the
      proposal containing the rule change.

211.  If two or more rules conflict, the rule with the lower number
      takes precedence.

212.  Any nomic may submit a statement for judgement to the moderator.
      Upon receipt of such a statement, the moderator must randomly
      select a member to judge the statement.  The moderator must then
      distribute the statement and the identity of the judge to all
      member nomics.

213.  A nomic which has been selected to judge must deliver judgement
      within two weeks by sending its judgement to the moderator, who
      must then distribute the judgement to all members.  A legal
      judgement is either "true" or "false", and must be in accordance
      with the rules.

214.  All business to be conducted with a member nomic shall be
      conducted with the liaison to that nomic.  No entity may be
      liaison to more than one member nomic.

215.  The voting members in this Nomic are: AckaNomic, Agora, Thring and
      Imperial Nomic 14. There are no nonvoting members.

======================================================================

Imperial Nomic 16 has asked to become a member.

Andre

Hm, yes, I suppose Chuck's win would have happened just after your
disappearance. Check out Proposals 1627 and 1628. Oh, and CFJ 876
(I think it was). Unfortunately, my win was invalidated by a glitch
in the Blot Rules. Sigh.

I am currently Notary. Contracts were Repealed quite some time ago, so

How about setting up the reply-to headers to point there ?

Moribund is perhaps excessive. At least one major thing has happened to it 
of late, i.e. InterNomic. By the time the various crises Agora's 
participation in that settle, we'll certainly find something else to amuse 
ourselves with.

Things have certainly been rather quiet these past weeks, though.

That certainly is a bad sign.

> Is the Ruleset too bloated, bureaucratic, and difficult to grasp? 

I'd also agree that we need to inject some fun into the game. Of late we've 
probably become too much concerned with dreary things like nonperformance 
of Officers and how to punish same, which is certainly not the kind of 
issue likely to attract debate from prospective recruits.

> Do we have too little exposure to attract the people who would play, if
> they knew about us?

I doubt very much, though, that whatever problem Agora has is lack of 
exposure. The player count is probably optimal in the 10-20 range, so the 
occasional watchers you mentioned should be enough to keep us filled up if 
there were incentives for them to join in.

> dynamic(?) or simpler nomics?

I think this is a Good Thing, myself. I don't have much time to look into 
what strange new rules the Acka players are concocting, but just knowing 
other Nomics exist (and now having an opportunity to actually communicate 
with them via InterNomic) is a comfort.

Hey, that would probably be a neat idea. Maybe you should pop back in to 
make this a formal Proto ? ;-)

Or even necessary ? Here's my own rough outline of the changes I think
are necessary to make Agora more attractive to new players :

- divide Agoran society into more levels (e.g. Citizens, Peers, Officers)
with the Citizen tier having both limited possibilities and limited
responsibilities, rather like your suggested Boot Camp.
- make an Abridged Rule Set (as Chuck, I think, once suggested - or was it 
Swann ?) available to Citizens, so they don't have to digest all of it at 
once.
- insitute an Agoran Constitution to protect Citizens from worrying too 
much whether what they do is legal

- of course, to keep this 'Basic Agora' interesting, we need more things to
do within the Game. I suggest inventing a whole slew of new Win Conditions, 
and make this our top priority.

My Term of Office as Registrar will expire on Sep. 1, in a few days. I'd 
like to remind the Speaker that e will be called upon to conduct an 
Election for this Office.

I intend to run again, of course; I hope Agorans won't have been put to too 
much inconvenience by the recent lapse in performance. :)

============================================================

A few words from the Promotor : first, I'd like to apologize for the
lateness of this distribution, due to an unfortunate and unlikely
combination of several unrelated factors (but then, what isn't ?). Rest 
assured that timely distribution of all Proposals remains one of my 
concerns and that such incidents are not likely to occur again.

As you can see, this is quite an amusing batch and certain to give rise to
some interesting debate - I hope ! ;)

============================================================

Proposal 2660 (Andre, AI=1)

Proposal 306
Proposed by: Thring

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Whenever a proposal is accepted, the member nomic that proposed it
gains two points.

============================================================

Proposal 2661 (Swann, AI=1)



Create a Rule with the following text:
{Title: Office of the Speaker-Elect.}

     Let there be the Office of Speaker-Elect.  The Speaker-Elect has 
     the duty to be the Speaker's successor.  Whenever a Speaker-Elect
     becomes Speaker, e ceases to be Speaker-Elect.  The Speaker can never
     hold the Office of Speaker-Elect, even temporarily.

     When the Office of Speaker-Elect is to be held temporarily by a 
     Player because of the Speaker-Elect becoming Speaker(or for any 
     other reason,) the Office is filled according to the Order of 
     Succession, as defined by other Rules, with the Speaker as Arbiter of
     Succession.

     The Speaker-Elect receives no salary for filling the Office of 
     Speaker-Elect.

     This rule takes precidence over all other Rules defining the 
     characteristics of the Office of Speaker-Elect.

{Comment: Straightforward Office/Officer Rule, the strong precidence
          clause is there to prevent the Speaker somehow becoming S-E.}

==================

Create a Rule with the following text:
{Title: When the Speaker is Tainted.}

     The Speaker is Tainted whenever the Player who is Speaker became
     Speaker by any means other than a normal Speaker transition.

     A normal Speaker transition occurs whenever the Rules require the
     Speaker-Elect to become Speaker, and the Office of Speaker-Elect is
     held in normal fashion.

     If the Rules require the Speaker-Elect to become Speaker, and that
     Office is held temporarily, the Speaker-Elect still becomes Speaker,
     but the resulting Speaker is Tainted.

     A Tainted Speaker may remain Speaker only until some other Player
     holds the Office of Speaker-Elect in normal fashion, at which
     point, the Speaker-Elect shall become Speaker.

{Comment: A S-E held in normal fasion is an elected position, so if
          we're creating democracy here, a S-E that wasn't elected
          should not be Speaker for long.  BTW, term-limits seem to
          have evolved here since a Speaker can't be S-E, e can't
          succeed eimself.}

==================
Rule 402 has its Title change from "The Speaker-Elect" to
"Speaker Transition."

Rule 402 is hereby amended to read as follows:

     Whenever the Rules call for the Speaker-Elect to become Speaker:

       1) The Speaker shall forward copies of all necessary materials
          for the performance of eir position, as soon as possible to
          the Speaker-Elect.
       2) The Speaker-Elect shall acknowledge the receipt of said
          materials as soon as possible after step 1.
       3) As soon as possible after step 2, the Speaker shall post a
          message to the Public Forum announcing that the
          Speaker-Elect has become the Speaker.  At the "Date:" of the
          Speaker's posting, the old Speaker shall cease to be Speaker
          and the Speaker-Elect shall become the Speaker.

      If the Speaker-Elect changes before the completion of this
      procedure, it must be begun again from step 1.

      If another Rule specifies that the Speaker-Elect becomes
      Speaker before the completion of step 3, such as the case when
      the Rules require an immediate Speaker transition, then this
      Rule defers to it, and the procedure above need not be completed.

      However, in any case where the above procedure is not completed
      before a transition of Speakers takes place, the new Speaker is
      still obliged to make a reasonable effort to obtain all materials
      necessary for the performance of eir duties from the former Speaker.
      If this is not possible, then the new Speaker shall make a reasonable
      attempt to recover this information from other sources. (The Players,
      the Officers, the Archivist etc.)

{Comment: This sort of naturally became a transition Rule, because that
          was what it was about before (making the existance of an S-E
          the trigger for transitions.) this rule no longer defines S-E, if
          it ever really did, nor does it cause any transitions itself.  It
          only defines what to do when the rules call for a transition
          (which led naturally to moving redundant lang. from
          Psychotic/Abandoned/On Hold Speaker Rules to this one.)}

==================
Rule 785 is amended to read as follows:

      If any Player suspects that the Speaker has Abandoned, e may
      send a message to all Players calling on the Speaker to announce
      eir presence.  The Speaker must reply to all Players within one
      week; if no communication from the Speaker is sent to all
      Players or to the Public Forum within that period, and the
      Speaker has not changed in that week, e is defined to have
      Abandoned.

      If the Speaker has Abandoned, then the Player who holds the Office of
      Speaker-Elect immediately becomes Speaker, and the old Speaker ceases
      to be Speaker.

      A Speaker who Abandons commits a Class A Crime.

{Comment: Notice the "immediatly" now triggers the last paragraph of
          402, and the S-E being an Office now eliminates the case where the
          Speaker abandons when an S-E does not exist.  All the transition
          Rules became shorter because of this.}

==================
Rule 681 is amended to read as follows:

      The Speaker may voluntarily give up Speakership by announcing
      the fact to all Players, at which point the Player who holds the
      Office of Speaker-Elect shall becomes Speaker, and the old Speaker
      ceases to be Speaker.

      When a Speaker voluntarily gives up Speakership in this manner,
      the former Speaker shall lose 5 Mil, and e shall further be
      prevented from Winning until the start of the next Game.

==================
Rule 1375 is amended to read as follows:

      If the Speaker is On Hold, then the Player who holds the Office
      of Speaker-Elect immediately becomes Speaker, and the old Speaker
      ceases to be Speaker.

      A Speaker who goes on Hold while e is still Speaker commits a
      Class B Crime.
==================
Rule 942 is amended to read as follows:

      If a Speaker is determined by CFJ to have made further play
      impossible by eir actions or lack thereof, and the CFJ is not
      appealed within the allowed time, or if such a determination
      is made upon appeal of a CFJ; AND if the Speaker has not changed
      since the CFJ was made, then the Player who holds the Office
      of Speaker-Elect immediately becomes Speaker, and the old Speaker
      ceases to be Speaker.

      A Speaker who makes further play impossible by eir actions or lack
      thereof commits a Class A Crime.

      "Impossible" is defined here to mean overwhelmingly psychotic
      behavior, a complete lack of interest in the Game, or
      uncooperativeness of the highest order. It does *not* include
     normal Speaker latitudes which have been taken by past Speakers
      for various reasons, whether justifiable or not, including but
      not limited to: temporary suspension of proposal distribution,
      resetting of scores, or accidental illegal actions. The Judge of
      the CFJ *must* take these extremely tight standards into
      account, and the accused Speaker *must* be given an opportunity
      to defend eirself.

      This Rule adds to the set of valid classes of Judgements, and
      takes precedence over other Rules which may attempt to prevent
      this class of Judgement.

{Comment: I have a sense this Rule needs to be tweeked in line with
          our Judical reforms, but that's not what I'm doing right now. Just
          thought I'd mention it.}

==================
Rule 786 is amended to read as follows:

      When the Office of Speaker-Elect is to be filled temporarily
      according to the Order of Succession, that order is defined to be:

      Promotor
      Assessor
      Justiciar
      Clerk of the Courts
      Rulekeepor
      Registrar
      Archivist
      <all other Officers in descending point order>
      <all other Players in descending point order>

      This list shall specifically exclude the Speaker, and Players who are
      On Hold.  Its order is determined at the time the Office is to be
      filled.

      Any Rule which requires the Office of Speaker-Elect to be filled
      according to the Order of Succession must specify an Arbiter
      of Succession; if it does not, the Speaker-Elect shall not be
      chosen according to that Rule. This Rule takes precedence over
      such Rules.  (If this would ever result in the Speaker filling the
      Office of Speaker-Elect, then the Speaker-Elect shall instead be
      filled by the Order of Succession, with the Speaker as Arbiter of
      Succession.)

      When the Office of Speaker-Elect is to be filled, the Arbiter of
      Succession shall, as soon as possible, announce in the Public
      Forum that the Office of Speaker-Elect is being temporarily filled by
      this Rule.  Once this announcement has been made, each Player has
      three days to decline to fill the Office by sending a message to the
      Arbiter stating e does so.

      During this three day period, the Office of Speaker-Elect is held by
      that Active Player highest in the order of succession who has not yet
      declined to the Arbiter.  If there is only one Active Player in the
      order of succession who has not declined, that Player may not decline.

      At the end of the three days, the Office is filled by the Active
      Player highest on the list of succession who did not decline the
      Office, and that player may no longer decline.

      As soon as possible after, and within four days of, the filling
      the Office of Speaker-Elect, the Arbiter of Succession shall
      announce which Active Player is now the Speaker-Elect.

      Announcements by the Arbiter have no effect on the identity of the
      Speaker-Elect.

{Comments: Yes the Speaker is out of the loop entirely.  What this Rule
           does now is insure that there is always an S-E in Office, and the
           S-E is someone other than the Speaker.  Since this rule does that
           now, there's no need for this to apply to the Speaker, since the
           Speaker is now allways suceeded by the S-E.  (BTW, the last line
           is to insure that there is a defined S-E even in the case the
           Arbiter screws up in eir job.  Even if the Arbiter does nothing,
           this rule still fills the Office of S-E with a player.)}

==================
Rule 1427 is hereby repealed.

{Comment: This democratic reform eliminates the timing problems this
          rule is supposed to address (changes in S-E while the Speaker is
          being Arbited, etc.)}
==================
Rule 1581 is amended to read as follows:

      Whenever there is a Game End, the Player who holds the Office
      of Speaker-Elect immediately becomes Speaker, and the old Speaker
      ceases to be Speaker.

{Comment: The change here is the S-E is no longer the winner.  The S-E
          is democratically elected via the Officer Rules.}

==================
Rule 1433 is amended by deleting the following paragraphs:

        - If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the
          Speaker-Elect. If there was already a Speaker-Elect, the old
          Speaker-Elect ceases to be Speaker-Elect.

        - If there is more than one Winner, the Winner with the
          highest Point total becomes the Speaker-Elect. If more than
          one Winner is tied for the highest score, the Speaker
          randomly selects one of them to be Speaker-Elect. If there
          was already a Speaker-Elect, the old Speaker-Elect ceases to
          be Speaker-Elect.

{Comment: See comment on 1581.}

Gack! -- this is cwertianly interesting.  I assume your interpretation of the
Proposal Rules means that every Internomic thing Andre posted was distributed
as a Agora Proposal.  I'd ask how the h**l that happened, but I can see it
all to clearly.. "Anything sent to the Promotor (read PF) labelled as a
Proposal...."

This has got to set some sort of record for null Proposals-- not just
Andre's amendments to non-existant Rules, but:

About this rule.  On what authority can it repeal itself?  Since, beforehand,
this rule repeals evey Rule that could grant it such authority before it
attempts such an act.  In fact, I can see a few potential results of passing

Alternitively, there is an ordering implicit in this so this Rule deletes, one
rule after another-- seperated by infinitesimal amounts of time-- presumably
in numerical order, until it deletes the rule allowing rules to delete other
rules.  Since the rule change rules are low in number, this would leave a
ruleset largely intact, but rather hard to amend.

Or, if it deletes Rules in order of precidence, we could be left with a
handful of high MI rules.

Sorry again that I wasn't around to catch the bounced message.  We both
must have left about the same time.  :)  I went to Colorado and New

I have tried to do this several times, but either majordomo or teleport's
mail system is munging them right back to teleport.com; I have been unable
to tell why.  :(

My personal feeling is that 20 is closer to optimal than 10, and we don't
even have that many actively Voting (let alone actually active)
participants right now.  I believe there is a "critical mass" below which
the game will become unable to support itself... and it may be entirely
too close to that number right now.

Oh, I fully agree that it is a Good Thing for there to be other nomics out
there.  I just think it would be sad for Agora to die out completely
because all the potential players went elsewhere (especially since most of
the players/founders of those games I've observed were at least subscribed
to Agora for a while, before starting their own game.  One could make a
case for Agora being their parent, if only in the sense of "Gee, let's
start our own nomic that's not as complicated and stuffy as that damned
Agora game...")

You never know, it could happen.  :P  :)  I've certainly been reading and
thinking about Agora a lot more of late.  And I was serious when I said I
don't want it to die... there's something comforting about knowing it's
still out there, even if I'm not playing.  Besides, what would I do with
the damn lists?  <laughing>

Necessary to some extent, I think.  Even in the full version.  I tend to
think that significant growth of interesting ideas isn't going to be very
practical unless we make room for them - it appears that the larger the
ruleset becomes, the harder it is to add new ideas or increase its size
further.

A very interesting idea.

These two ideas, taken together, are in essence the core of what I had in
mind with the Boot Camp idea - A form of Agora where players are not fully
involved, but in which they do not need to grasp everything immediately,
either.  What other differences do you see between Citizens and Peers?
And do Citizens have their own group of Officers?

The Constitution/Constitutional Convention idea rears its ugly head again.
I should dig out my old protos... although I was less concerned with
player rights than with the ability to bootstrap a completely stalled
game, and/or to make sweeping changes to the Ruleset all at once.  Of
course, that predated multi-part proposals.

Yes.  And, if you are going to have different levels of involvement, you
might consider having different *types* of "wins"... Is a Citizen winning
the same game as the Peers are playing, and resetting the entire thing?
Or is he winning a different "game", with different effects?  Even if he
is winning the same "game", does he need to fulfill the same requirements
to win as a Peer?  More requirements?  Less?

More chattering from a non-Player (why should you be listening to me?) and
maybe more things to think about...

Coren / Gary

BTW, what is going on, Chuck?  Calling on yourself to identify yourself?
(Does your posting that to the PF count as identifying yourself?  You did
admit in the same message that you were Speaker...)  Proposing "Nomic is
Dead"???  I hope these are not signs of Agora-Despair.  Maybe you're just
trying to force a test of the Psychotic Speaker Rule?  <laughing>  -C-

Bah.  Bah, bah, bah.  I dislike things like the "Nomic is Dead" proposal;,
just because one of these days, *everyone* will react this way, without
telling anyone, and instead of amusing chaos, we'll have no Ruleset.  I
have said that before, repeatedly.  I *like* fun and chaos... but not at
the risk of utterly destroying the game.

If I am allowed to tranfer Kudos, please transfer one Kudo from Chuck, for
proposing "Nomic is Dead", a dangerously irresponsible proposal, to Andre,
for his work as Internomic Liason.

If I am allowed a second Kudo transfer, please transfer one Kudo from
Swann, for Voting FOR 2659, to KoJen, who doesn't deserve to have a Honour

Thank you,

      legal Vote on that Proposal, then that Player shall receive one
      Mil at the end of the Voting Period of that Proposal.

      The Assessor shall detect and report these Mark transfers, and
      shall do so no later than the time e announces the Voting
      Results of the Proposal for which the Player's Vote was cast.
=================

      FOR Votes less the number of AGAINST Votes.  If, however, a
      Proposal has received more AGAINST Votes than FOR Votes, the
      Proposer loses a number of Mils equal to the number of AGAINST
      Votes less the number of FOR Votes.  If the number of FOR Votes
      and AGAINST Votes are equal, the Proposer neither gains nor
      loses Marks as a result of this Rule.

      The loss of Marks (but not the gain of Marks) described
      in this Rule applies even to a Disinterested Proposal.

      For the purpose of this Rule, Votes by Voting Entities which are
      not Players do not count.

============================================================

Proposal 2663 (Swann, AI=2)

Numbers are of equal importance

Rule 1349 has its MI increased to 2

{Comments: This and 109 were an obvious pair to Mutate, 109 shouldnt be
     of higher Precedence than the Rule Number Rule.  At best, they 
     should be equal: which is what I propose here.  Second, I think the
     middle tier of our Precedence System (MI = 2) is ill used, when, it
     should be growing in importance to reflect the increase of the
     volatility of Agoran Democracy.  This is the first in a series of
     Mutations.}

============================================================

Proposal 2664 (Swann, AI=2)

Protect the Legality of Proposals

Rule 404 has its MI increased to 2

{Comment: IMO this is an important rule, and almost fundamental to what
     I think of when I think of Agora.  I do not think an MI 1 Rule 
     should be able to trump this Rule, and it's hung around more than long
     enough w/o any problems.}

============================================================

Proposal 2665 (Swann, AI=2)

Coercive Proposals

Rule 1003 has its MI increased to 2

{Comment: This is the mirror twin of the bonus clause Rule which Steve
     is reviving at MI 2.  IMO, this rule is at least as important.}

============================================================

Proposal 2666 (Swann, AI=2)

Protect the right to CFJ

Rule 991 has its last paragraph deleted.
Rule 991 has its MI increased to 2

{Comment:  Other rules can define the process of dealing with CFJs once
     they are Called.  But I think the right of Players to Call for 
     Judgement should be protected by a higher precedence.  This also 
     disinfects the Rule. (I've left appeals alone, since historically
     they've been full of holes.)  I don't think this will alter Kelly's
     Judicial Reform PROPOSAL, since I don't think it's needed to amend this
     Rule to revamp the courts.}

============================================================

Proposal 2667 (Swann, AI=1)

Repeal 1574

Rule 1574 is hereby repealed.

{Comment: Not only is this redundant with the current Officer Rules, and
          Requires an AI=2, but the current Officer Rules break it
          since anyone installed by a Referendum will only hold the
          office temporarily. (IMO: 790's "held in normal fashion"
          only applies to Elections.)}

============================================================

Proposal 2668 (Swann, AI=1)

Broaden Impeachment

Rule 1486 is hereby amended by deleting the last paragraph.

{Comment: A companion to the repeal of 1574.  The only benifit 1574 added
          to the Ruleset was the ability to Referendum against truly
          troublesome officers. (the democratic aspects have been taken over
          by other rules)  This can be dealt with by allowing Referenda to
          Impeech any Officer.}

I previously erred in assigning Rule Numbers--however, the numbers
erroniously assigned stand.  I neglected the Rule created by
Proposal 2653.  It is now assigned a number of 1649.

Proto-Proposal
---
Unity Vote Reward

Create a Rule (titled "Groups and Unity Vote") reading :

   If a Group is entitled to cast Votes on a Proposal, its Vizier may elect 
   to declare a Unity Vote on that Proposal. This is done by sending a 
   message to the Assessor, clearly indicating that the Group is casting
   Unity Vote FOR or AGAINST a given Proposal.

   Casting Unity Vote is only legal if the Group's Treasury holds at least 
   one EV at the time the Vote is cast; at this time, one EV will be 
   transferred from the Group's Treasury to the Bank, which transfer shall 
   be reported by the Assessor.

   If all Members of the Group Vote on the named Proposal, and all vote as
   specified by the Unity Vote, the Group itself shall cast two Votes of the
   specified Vote Value on the named Proposal. (No further transfer of EVs is
   required for this.) If, on the other hand, not all Members Vote, or not all
   Vote the same way, the Group shall not be entitled to cast any Vote on that
   Proposal.
---

WTD : this should alter and reinforce Group dynamics, making them closer
to political parties. It gives Groups more clout, of course, and
encourages Players to pay attention to other Players' opinions of
Proposals. It's also a brand new way to use EVs - but should meet the
requirements of Rule 206.

Looks like it might be time for another round of that traditional
Agoran subgame, 'Defining Platonism'. Let the remark above constitute
your opening move in this round of the game. My response shall be to
ask: how can it be that the opinions and interpretations of the
Players are irrelevant to the meaning of the Ruleset, when the
Ruleset itself seems to deny this by making reference to game custom
amd commonsense in Rule 217?

I am embarrassed to report that I have been forgetting to conduct
Powers lotteries since I became Assessor on Wed, July 31. There
should have been 6 lotteries in that time, conducted on or around
each of the Mondays August 5, 12, 19 and 26, and Sep 2 and 9. I now
propose to correct this oversight, using the procedures set out below.

A question immediately arises concerning the conducting of these
lotteries. They are being conducted very late: should I try to
calculate who was Active and who was not at each of the times
the lotteries should have been conducted? I think not. As I read
R1603, the transfers resulting from these late-conducted lotteries
will take place as of this message. That is, the lotteries, although
they are being conducted late, are being conducted in the present.
They are, in particular, not being conducted in the past and merely
being reported in the present. I conclude that I should use the
current list of Active Players. That list, which consists of 14
Players, is as follows:

(A) Andre            engels@win.tue.nl                         Mar 21 1996
(A) Chuck            ccarroll@dfw.net                          Jan 03 1996

(A) Morendil         morendil@micronet.fr                      Feb 08 1996
(A) Murphy           zvyezda@ix.netcom.com                     Aug 23 1996
(A) Oerjan           oerjan@nvg.unit.no                        Jun 28 1996
(A) Steve            gardner@aurora.cc.monash.edu.au           Jul 16 1996
(A) Swann            gb485@cleveland.freenet.edu               Aug 05 1996
(A) Vanyel           blahedo@quincy.edu                        Aug 22 1996
(A) Zefram           zefram@dcs.warwick.ac.uk                  Jan 31 1996

I will now send a message to the dice server <dice@danpost4.uni-c.dk>,
asking it to roll a 14-sided die, 10 times. (We will probably only need
6 rolls, but the extra 4 rolls may be necessary.) The response from
the dice server is reproduced below.

>Date: Tue, 10 Sep 1996 05:39:21 +0200

>Subject: Player selection in Powers lotteries

>
>  13     3    13     9     7     3    14    13     6     9

Thus the winners of the 6 lotteries are: Vanyel, Coren, Vanyel, Murphy,
Michael, and Coren.

I shall now determine which Cards these Players are to receive. There
are at present 11 Cards in the Bank: 3 Immunity Cards (Steve has one),
2 Oracle Cards, 1 Influence Card (presently in Limbo, but still in the
Bank), 3 Quiet Cards, and 2 Skeptic Cards. I shall simply number
these Cards in order: 1. Immunity #1; 2. Immunity#2; 3. Immunity #3;
4. Oracle #1; 5. Oracle #2; 6. Influence; 7. Quiet #1; 8. Quiet #2;
9. Quiet #3; 10. Skeptic #1; 11. Skeptic #2.

I shall now send a message to the dice server requesting 10 rolls of
an 11 sided dice (again only 6 rolls will probably be needed, but 
some extra may be necessary). After a Card is transferred, it is 
obviously not available to be transferred again, so if a number is
repeated, I shall simply ignore it and use one the extra dice rolls.
The reponse from the server is reproduced below:

>Date: Tue, 10 Sep 1996 05:53:12 +0200
>To: gardner@aurora.cc.monash.edu.au
>Subject: Card selection in Powers lotteries

>Dice rolls requested by:  gardner@aurora.cc.monash.edu.au

>
>  10    11     1     9     6    11     7     3     9    10

Therefore, the results of the Powers lotteries are as follows:

Vanyel receives a Skeptic Card.
Coren receives a Skeptic Card.
Vanyel receives an Immunity Card.
Murphy receives a Quiet Card.
Michael receives the Influence Card (3-vote, as per R1603).
Coren receives a Quiet Card.

Michael should note that his Influence Card is in Limbo until the
conclusion of the Voting Periods of Proposals 2662-2668.

Vanyel and Coren should note that they are now under the ten day
restriction defined in R1518, and may not purchase Cards from the
Bank or receive them from other Players during this period.

All the recipients are reminded that they have 1 week to either
use their Cards or trade them to other Players.

>And now, Contests are moribund, too. 

Maybe, maybe not. Here's an idea for a Contest Chuck and I have been
bouncing around for a while:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                      Regulations of A Contest of Prediction
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 0: Administrivia

0.0   The name of this Contest is A Contest of Prediction.

0.1   The Contestmaster is Eljefe. The Contestmaster may replace
      himself as Contestmaster with another Player, provided that the
      Player and the Contestants all consent. In that event, this
      regulation shall be automatically amended to indicate the
      identity of the new Contestmaster.

0.2   Only Chuck and Steve may enter as Contestants. The entry fee is
      10 EVs. The match commences only when both Chuck and Steve
      have transferred the entry fee to the Contest Fund, and if they 
      have met all other conditions of entry set out in these
      Regulations. The 20 EVs in the Contest Fund are called the
      'grand prize'.

0.3   It is a condition of entry into the Contest that neither
      Contestant hold the Offices of Promotor or Assessor. Neither
      Contestant is permitted to assume these Offices voluntarily
      during the course of the match. If either Contestant comes
      to hold either of these Offices involuntarily during the course
      of the match (eg due to being Speaker), then play is suspended
      as soon as these Regulations permit it to be, until such time
      as neither Contestant holds either Office.

0.4   All Currency transfers required by these Regulations are to be
      detected and reported by the Contestmaster.

0.5   The Regulations may be amended at any time with the unanimous
      consent of the Contestmaster and both Contestants.

0.6   In the event of a dispute about these Regulations, the 
      Contestmaster is empowered to act as referee, and make a
      binding determination.

0.7   At the end of the match, and after the grand prize has been
      been dispersed, this Contest is dissolved.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 1: Definitions

1.0   The word 'point' refers to points scored by Contestants in the
      course of play in the Contest, and not to any form of Agoran
      Currency.

1.1   The word 'batch' refers to a set of Proposals distributed in a
      single message by the Promotor.

1.2   The word 'game' refers to a single encounter between the
      Contestants, in which each has the opportunity to select a
      Proposal, the outcome of which is to be predicted by the other
      Contestant. The Proposals selected by each Player in any
      single game come from the same batch. Each game concludes when
      the Voting Periods of the Proposals in that batch conclude. 

1.3   Once one of the Contestants has specified in the Public Forum a
      Proposal the outcome of which is to be predicted by the other
      Contestant, that game is said to be 'afoot'.

1.4   The word 'match' refers to a series of games, over the course
      of which each Contestant makes 5 predictions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 2: Play

2.0   Unless play is suspended, each game of the match commences when
      a batch of Proposals is distributed by the Promotor.

2.1   Within 4 days of the commencement of a game, each of the
      Contestants shall specify in the Public Forum a Proposal in the
      current batch, the outcome of which is to be predicted by the
      other Contestant. During this period, either or both of the
      Contestants may also specify the e passes, ie, e declines to
      specify a Proposal in the batch, provided that e is permitted
      by these Regulations to do so, as set out below.  Unless play
      has been suspended, a Contestant who neither specifies a
      Proposal nor passes during this period forfeits the game. 

2.2   Each Contestant has the option to pass at most twice during the
      match. A Contestant passes by announcing in the Public Forum
      within 4 days of the commencment of a game that e is passing
      for that game. A Contestant need never pass if e does not wish
      to do so, provided that the other Contestant has not yet made 5
      predictions in the match. However, if one of the Contestants
      has already made 5 predictions in the match, then the other
      Contestant *must* pass (this does not apply to tie-breakers). A
      Contestant who has already passed twice during the match may
      not pass again. A Contestant who has passed is still required
      to make a prediction of the outcome of the Proposal selected by
      eir opponent, if any.   

2.3   If a Proposal has been specified for which a Contestant is to
      predict the outcome, such a prediction is to be made in the
      Public Forum before the end of the Voting Period of the
      Proposal. A Contestant may predict at most one of the
      outcomes, pass or fail. If a Contestant fails to make a
      prediction on a Proposal as required and within the time
      allotted by these Regulations, then e forfeits that game.

2.4   Play can be suspended, either by mutual agreement of the
      Contestants, or as otherwise set out in these Regulations,
      provided that no game is currently afoot, and provided that a
      duration for the suspension of play is also specified. (If the
      suspension is by mutual agreement of the Contestants, the
      duration of the suspension must be clearly specified, either by
      naming a day the suspension is to be lifted, or by specifying
      the length of the suspension. The Contestants may not agree to
      suspend play 'until both agree the suspension shall be lifted'
      or such like. The Regulations may impose such conditions on the
      length of suspension of play as they see fit to impose.) If the
      Contestants agree to suspend play, they shall inform the
      Contestmaster of their agreement. As soon as possible after
      becoming so informed, the Contestmaster shall announce the
      suspension of play and its duration in the Public Forum. Play
      is then suspended as of the Contestmaster's announcement. No
      game shall commence, and no Contestant shall forfeit or suffer
      penalties for forfeiture, while play is suspended.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 3: Scoring.

3.0   Each Contestant scores one point for a correct prediction,
      and zero points for an incorrect prediction. Thus, a perfect
      score in the match for either Contestant is 5 points.

3.1   In any game in which neither Contestant passed, and the score
      for that game is 1-0 in favor of one of the Contestants (ie one
      has made a correct prediction while the other has made an
      incorrect prediction), the Contestant making the correct
      prediction is the winner of that game, and 3 EVs are
      transferred to em from the other Contestant.

3.2   A Contestant who forfeits a game scores no points for that
      game, and suffers the penalties for losing a game set out
      Regulation 3.1.

3.3   Each Contestant makes exactly 5 predictions during the
      match, excluding tie-breakers as described below. Once a
      Contestant has made 5 predictions in the match, that Contestant
      makes no further predictions, although games continue to be
      played until both Contestants have made 5 predictions.

3.4   At the end of the match, the Contestant with the highest
      cumulative score over all the games of the match is the winner
      of the match, and of the grand prize. The contents of the
      Contest Fund are transferred to em. In the event of a tie, two
      extra tie-breaker games shall be played to determine the
      winner, with neither Contestant permitted to pass during the
      tie-breakers. If the match is still tied at the conclusion of
      the tie-breakers, the match shall be declared a draw, and the
      grand prize split evenly between the Contestants.

                 FINAL JUDGEMENT OF APPEAL CFJ 858

    Rule 1482 should be interpreted such that the meaning of a word
    used in a Rule is a part of the Rule's meaning, and therefore
    cannot be changed significantly by Rules of lower precedence.

======================================================================

Requested Injunction:

The Relevant Rules are 1030 and 1482.

I request that the Judge issue an Injunction requiring the Rulekeepor
to annotate the Ruleset with the Statement.

-zefram


======================================================================
Decision of Judge Coren:  TRUE

And Coren saith unto him, "What is meaning?", and is very tempted to wash
his hands of this mess.  ;)  Instead, he refuses to release Barrabas,
since there's enough thieves wandering Agora at the moment.  <mwahahah>

This statement is actually composed of two parts, both of which must be
true for the Statement to be True:

1) "...the meaning of a word used in a Rule is part of the Rule's
meaning..." and

2) "...[a Rule's meaning] cannot be changed significantly by Rules of
lower precedence."

Both of these parts are intended to be applied against the Precedence
Rules, particularly 1482:

----------------------------------------

Rule 1482/0 (Semimutable, MI=3)
Precedence Between Rules with Unequal MI's

      In a conflict between Rules with different Mutability Indices,
      the Rule with the higher Mutability Index takes precedence over
      the Rule with the lower Mutability Index.

----------------------------------------

This Judge will treat each of these two parts of the Statement in turn.

*** PART THE FIRST: ***

"...the meaning of a word used in a Rule is part of the Rule's
meaning..."

By far the easier of the two, if rather circular and indirect.  A Rule is
nowhere defined in the Rules themselves; however, it is self-evident that
the Rules, individually and as a whole, have a specific meaning expressed
within the common language of the Game - if they did not, both past and
future play would be (have been) impossible.

Within the common language of thhe Game (currently English), Rules are
made up paragraphs, sentences, sentence fragments, and individual words,
each of which is composed of one or more words, which can be defined as
the smallest units of language that communicate a meaning.  The meaning of
each higher level is defined by the interaction of the meanings of the
words which make it up:  thus, changing the meaning of a word within one
of those levels (including Rule) changes that meaning, and is part of it.

Therefore, this part of the Statement is trivially True.

*** PART THE SECOND: ***

2) "...[a Rule's meaning] cannot be changed significantly by Rules of
lower precedence."

Slightly more complicated; however:

1) This judge refuses to use R101 as an argument, since it is clear that
R101 only refers to the Rules as an integral unit.

2) R116 says that changing the Rules is "...permitted only when a Rule or
set of Rules explicitly or implicitly permits it."  So changing a Rule by
changing that Rule's meaning must be permitted somewhere else in the Rules.

3) R1497 (Truth in Advertising) prevents a Player from deliberately
misconstruing the content of a Rule if it results in some sort of
required message, or in a post to the public forum.  This in most cases
prevents a Player purposefully changing the meaning of a Rule without
changing the wording.

4) This means that the only way a Rule can be changed in this way is
through a Rule Change, controlled by R105, which states the types of Rule
changes permissable, of which the only one applicable is an Amendment
Rule Change, and through R1339, which defines Proposed Rule Changes and
Non-Propoosed Rule Changes.  Either of these can be used to change the
meaning of a Rule through changing its wording; however, such Rule
Changes (of either type) are ineffectual and incapable of changing a Rule
unless they are in a Proposal of an AI/MI equal to that of the Rule in
question, or derive from such a Proposal or Rule.

This leaves one final potential argument:  that the "inherent meaning" of
word *within the context of Agora* can be redefined by a low MI Rule, and
change the meaning of that word everywhere else in the game, including in
higher MI Rules.  The corolary to point One is that such an attempt
indeed changes the meaning of the Rule in question, and thus would
conflict with R116, which prohibits changing a Rule in any way not
defined by the Ruleset.  This mannner of change could not be the result
of an non-Rule Entity (which defers to all Rules in matters of
precedence); the other way to do it would be with a Non-proposed Rule
Change - which must be of an AI/MI such that its Power is high enough to
affect the Rule in question, per R1322.

Thus, the second part of the Statement is also TRUE, which leads to the
conclusion that this entire CFJ must be Judged ***TRUE***.

Note that this in the future could be changed by creating a new type of
Rule Change explicitly or implicitly allowing this type of change, or by
mutating a Rule making such a change possible to a higher MI that the
rule defining permissable Rule Changes (no such Rule currently exists).

Note that it could also be argued that such a change in meaning is
impermissible under the Rule prohibiting arbitrary changes to Entities,
since a cursory overview of the Rules in question leads me to believe
that Rules are indeed Nomic Entities.

The text of the applicable Rules are listed below.

Permissibility of the Unprohibited

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted

Rule 105/0 (Semimutable, MI=3)
What Is a Rule Change?

      A Rule Change is any of the following:
        1) the enactment of a new Rule (a "Creation"). ;
        2) the amendment of an existing Rule (an "Amendment");
        3) the repeal of an existing Rule (a "Repeal");
        4) the modification of an existing Rule's Mutability Index (a
           "Mutation").

      Additional Rule Changes may be created by appropriate
      legislation.  No Rule Change may directly change any part of the
      Game State other than the Rules.  No Rule may be changed except
      by the means of a Rule Change of a type specified in the Rules.

----------------------------------------

Rule 1339/3 (Semimutable, MI=3)
Rule Changes

      There are two types of Rule Change. A Proposed Rule Change is a
      Rule Change which appears in a Proposal, and which, insofar as
      the Rules permit it to take effect, has the effect of Creating,
      Amending, Mutating, Repealing or otherwise changing a Rule as
      defined elsewhere in the Rules, directly as a result of the
      passage of a Proposal. A non-Proposed Rule Change has the same
      effect as a Proposed Rule Change, but insofar as the Rules
      permit it to take effect, it does so not as the direct result
      of the passage of a Proposal, but rather, indirectly, as the
      result of the effect or action of a Rule.

      All Rule Changes, of either type, are subject to the following
      constraints:

      An individual Rule Change must change exactly one Rule.

      Any Rule Change which affects an existing Rule must clearly
      identify the Number of the Rule to be affected.

      Any Rule Change which creates a New Rule may specify the
      Mutability Index of the New Rule; however, if the Mutability
      Index is specified it must be greater than or equal to 1.  If
      the Mutability Index of any Rule created by a Rule Change is not
      specified, it shall be 1.

      Any Rule Change which creates a New Rule may specify the
      Category to which the New Rule will be assigned.  If the
      Category specified exists, the Rule shall be assigned to that
      Category.  If the Category specified does not exist, or no
      Category is specified, the Rulekeepor shall assign the Rule to
      an appropriate category of eir own choice.

      Any Rule Change which changes the Mutability Index of a Rule
      must clearly specify the new value of the Rule's Mutability
      Index.

      Any Rule Change which changes the text of a Rule must clearly
      and unambiguously specify the changes which are to be made. If
      the Rule Change quotes old text which is to be replaced with new
      text, then the quoted old text must match exactly with actual
      text in the Rule, with the exception of whitespace and
      capitalization. This takes precedence over Rules which would
      permit such differences, even if the differences would be
      considered inconsequential by such Rules.

      Any Rule Change which does not meet these criteria shall not
      have any legal force.

[CFJ 822: Any Change to the Rules in a way other than the two methods
described here is illegal.]

Rule 1322/2 (Semimutable, MI=3)
Effectiveness of Rule Changes

      Every Rule Change shall have associated with it an Index, called

      The Power of a non-Proposed Rule Change shall be the Mutability
      Index of the Rule in which the Rule Change is contained.

      The Power of a Proposed Rule Change shall be the Adoption Index
      of the Proposal in which the Rule Change is contained.

      No Rule Change may take effect unless its Power is not less than
      the current Mutation Index of the Rule it seeks to change, if
      any, and the Mutation Index that the Rule would possess after
      the change, if any.

Judge Coren



======================================================================
Decision of Justice favor:  FALSE

This is a difficult one, touching on an important issue that I
think has not been heavily treated by previous Courts.  The
question at issue is exactly what constitutes a conflict
between two Rules for the purposes of Rule 1482.  It seems
clear to me that if a low-MI Rule attempts to change the meaning
of a word or words in a higher-MI Rule, and that attempt constitutes
a conflict, then the attempt fails per 1482.  It also seems
clear that *some* such attempts would count as conflicts,
and therefore fail ("The phrase 'abide by all', in the Rules
of Agora Nomic, shall mean 'ignore'.")

The remaining question, then, is whether or not there are *any*
changes of meaning which would *not* count as conflicts for
the purposes of 1482.  One obvious candidate is a change of
meaning which is simply a clarification of a word that is not
otherwise defined in the Rules, changing the meaning only by
making it tighter and better-defined.  For instance, a rigorous
set of Rules which defined just what an "action" is in
Game terms should be able to touch the meaning of "action"
in Rule 1011, even if the Rule doing the defining was only
MI=1, as long as this touching did not fundamentally alter
the import and functioning of the higher-MI Rule.  A
rigorous definition of what it means to have "legal force"
should be able to touch the use of that term in Rule 114,
without having to be MI=3.  If some high-MI Rule makes a
passing reference to a Nomic Week, it should be possible
for a change to the low-MI Nomic Week Rule to touch the
meaning of that high-MI Rule at that point, without
requiring a higher VI.

I therefore find that the Statement here is FALSE, because
there are circumstances under which it is not true.  While
there are many cases in which a change to the meaning of
a word *would* fail per 1482, there are also some in
which it would not, because it would not be per se a
conflict.  The electorate, and in extremis the Courts,
will have to determine for themselves where each
individual case falls on the continuum.

It would be possible to find otherwise, and by finding
FALSE I may be leaving open a loophole in the Mutability
system through which demons will escape to plague the
community.  But I believe that the danger of that is
outweighed by the desire to keep flexibility in the
Ruleset, and not require elaborate and difficult
actions (such as passing Proposals with unusual AIs)
to acheive mundane ends (such as adjusting the meaning
of a word).

Justice Favor


======================================================================
Decision of Justice Steve:  FALSE

I hereby reverse Judge Coren's Judgement of TRUE, and find that the
Statement is FALSE.

I'd like to begin by thanking Favor, Eljefe and Vanyel for the
valuable contributions they have made to the discussions about
this Statement. As a result of them, I think a consensus view has
emerged about how the issues raised by the Statement should be
treated, a result which I think constitutes valuable progress.

Although the other Justices, Favor and Eljefe, will doubtless
give similar arguments to the ones I give here, I think it is
worth including my own individual take on the subject.

I think the CFJ was motivated by a desire to see prohibited a
process which I have called 'amendment by stealth'. An example
of amendment by stealth would be a Rule which stated that, for
the purposes of R1322, 'less than' is to be understood to mean
'greater than'. The question arises, could such a Rule have its
intended of effect (of totally undermining the system of Mutability
Indices), despite the fact the R1322 has MI=3, and our hypothetical
Rule only MI=1? If it could, then it would seem that high mutability
is not much protection against a radical change in the meaning
and application of a Rule.

However, a powerful argument can be made against the possibility of
such obviously pathological cases of amendment by stealth. This is
the argument given by the Caller, namely, that amendment by stealth
effectively constitutes a Rule Change by means other than those
sanctioned by the Rules, and is therefore illegal. I am inclined
to accept this argument - for obviously pathological cases.

Problems arise, however, as soon as it is noticed that, firstly,
not all cases are as pathological as the above, and secondly, that
it may not always be clear whether a case is pathological or not.
An example: let us suppose that the phrase 'as soon as possible'
was used in the Ruleset prior to its having been given a definition
in the Rules for the first time by Proposal 805 (I don't know if
that's true or not, but it might well be). After the passage of
Proposal 805, could the new R805 be effective in giving the phrase
'as soon as possible' the meaning it tried to give it, a meaning
which is considerably different from the ordinary meaning of that
phrase? In one sense, the point is moot, since our subsequent
behaviour shows that we did accept R805 as successfully defining 'as
soon as possible'. Furthermore, we have since changed the meaning
of that phrase several more times, each time without incident.
This example alone is enough to show that the Statement is false,
for here we have a case where the meaning of a word (or a phrase
in this case) can be changed by changing a Rule which might well
be of lower precedence. That is, we take R1023 as defining what
'as soon as possible' means, for all Rules which use that phrase,
of whatever precedence.

======================================================================
Decision of Justice elJefe:  FALSE

I find that the original judgement was incorrect, and vote to reverse
so that the CFJ is judged FALSE.

I distinguish two cases in the subject of the CFJ.  Where a Rule is clearly
relying for its meaning on the ordinary natural-language meaning of a word,
that meaning ought not be "hijacked" by a lower-precedence Rule.  However,
the statement also seems to cover the case where a Rule is explicitly relying
for its meaning on the definition of a word contained or supposed to be
contained in other (possibly lower-MI) Rules.  In this case, and in most
cases where an ambiguity or omission in a Rule is clarified by a lower-
precedence Rule, the meaning is shared by that lower-precedence Rule and
subject to change when the lower-precedence Rule is changed.

Rule 101 can be our guide.  It says that players must obey the Rules
"in the form in which they are then in effect".  I would say that if a
Rule uses a term whose meaning is imprecise, or which could rely (either
wholly or partially) for its meaning on another Rule, and another Rule
supplies the missing meaning, then the "form" of the Rules requires that
we assign the meaning given in the second Rule, even if it has a lower
MI, and if that second Rule is changed then the meaning changes.

However, if a Rule uses a term whose meaning is precise in ordinary
English (e.g. "greater than"), then a lower-precedence rule cannot
change this to something different ("in Rule XXX, "greater than" shall
mean "less than"). In a case like this, the Rules would have the
"form" of a conflicting Ruleset, which would be dealt with by the
appropriate conflict-resolution mechanism.

----------------------------------------

Rule 101/0 (Semimutable, MI=3)
Obey the Rules

      All Players must always abide by all the Rules then in effect,
      in the form in which they are then in effect.  The Rules in the
      Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the first game.
      The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (Immutable) and
      201-219 (Mutable).

The primary purpose of the DATA statement is to give names to
constants; instead of referring to pi as 3.141592653589793 at every
appearance, the variable PI can be given that value with a DATA
statement and used instead of the longer form of the constant.  This
also simplifies modifying the program, should the value of pi change.

There is a glaring problem with our ruleset, and it derives from the use
of the word "Vote".  In short, it is too overloaded.  We have that one
word used in so many contexts it's terrible:
 * the voting process as a whole: "the vote on Prop 9999"
 * someone's opinion: "a player's vote on Prop 9999"
 * to designate the act of sending in that vote: "when a player votes"
 * part of the name for extra clout: "Extra Votes"
 * a currency: "Extra Votes"
 * a nebulous entity which demonstrates opinion: "cast a vote on..."
 * a type of Player: "Voter"
 * a type of Entity: "Voting Entity"
 * a period of time: "Voting Period"

SO... I propose a few new words here.

An "Alia" is one item of currency, plural "Aliae".  One-time conversion
  required of EVs to Aliae.
A "Clout" is one unit of power, and is specific to a proposal.  In
  general, spending one Alia will gain a Player/Group one more Clout on
  a specified proposal.  Plural "Clouts".  By default, each Player has
  one Clout for each proposal.
No term for "Voting Entity"; but the entities that were "Voting
  Entities" before now specifically get one Clout (by default) per
  proposal.  Note that this allows entities not normally given voting
  power to get it in certain circumstances.
"Peer" replaces "Voter".

The word "vote" would then be only slightly overloaded, which is ok:
we'd still have "Voting Period", and as a word for the voting process;
we could talk about Clouts being cast one way or another.

206 would then read something like:
      Clouts are Agoran Entities.  Clouts define the amount of influence
      an Entity has on a Proposal, and each Clout allotted to an Entity
      is specific to a single Proposal.

      Only Entities which possess at least one Clout for a given
      Proposal have any influence on that Proposal.  As a direct result
      of this Rule, Players and Groups each get one Clout per Proposal.
      Other Rules may allot further Clouts for whatever reason, but no
      Entity may be allotted more than five Clouts on any single
      Proposal.

Or something like that.  (Suggestions welcome on rewordings, btw.)  I'm
currently wading through the other rules to find "Voting" things which
need replacing...

I think you're exaggerating a little. The only real overloading is
between 'extra votes' (qua votes) and 'Extra Votes' (qua units of
currency which are also votes). Hence I can see a justification for
changing the name of 'Extra Votes' to 'Clout'. (However, I would
insist that 'clout' be treated somewhat like a mass noun: the plural
of 'clout' is 'clout'.  Compare my veriosn of R206 below.)
'Alia/Aliae' seems ugly and unnecessary to me. Changing 'Voter' to
'Peer' is harmless but also unnecessary, in my view.

I would have this as:

      Clout is an Agoran Entity. Clout defines the amount of
      influence an Entity has (is permitted to have?) on a Proposal,
      and each unit of Clout allotted to an Entity is specific to a
      single Proposal.

and so on in that vein.

Perhaps a bit--some of the overloading is, indeed, harmless.  However,
it has caused some confusion in the past, with questions of "can you
cast a vote twice?  No, but you can change your vote; and if you cast an
Extra Vote, you *can* cast a second vote...."  More recently, the
discussion of Unity Votes has muddied the waters even more by further
dissociating the Extra Vote from the extra vote; plus, is the original
vote counted separately or differently from the extra ones?  A serious
flaw in the current method of denotation is that the total influence of
a given Player (or Group) on a vote is subdivided into "regular" votes
and extra votes, which all do the same thing and are functionally
interchangeable.  Phaugh.  I contend that the second paragraph of 206 is
awkward and contrived, and is easily fixed by my solution.

Well, I admit that was a cutesy touch, but my reasoning went: IRL,
"clout" is measurable but not countable--a mass noun.  But in Agora it
would be a countable quantity....  So I put a spin on it, and I must say
it sounds highly Agoran to my ear (kind of like that great Currency, the
Kudo. :)

What this does, though, is give distinctly separate methods of denoting
the various concepts involved here.  I think it would be less confusing,
personally.  Those concepts are: the currency we have and can trade
which gives us special influence on a vote; the specific amount of
influence we have on the vote of a specific proposal; and the general
mechanisms of voting.  Plus, it gets rid of a misleading term (Voter)
whose etymology no longer reflects its meaning, and a term which will
become unnecessary with this reform (Voting Entity).

Not 'is permitted to have'--that would be sort of a 'maximum clout'
level, which we currently have set at 5.  But yeah, something like the
above.  Like I said, I'm open to wording suggestions.  (Also: I'm not
really tied to the name "Alia" or the association of Clouts as the
amound of influence, as opposed to the currency.  Suggestions are
welcome here.)

Another thing to consider: all the phrasing problems over how to work
the Unity Vote would be easy with my phrasing: "A Group (via the Vizier)
may spend one Alia to declare a Unity Vote on a Proposal; if it succeeds
the Group acquires two extra Clouts on that Proposal, and if it fails
the Group loses all Clouts on that Proposal."

Yet another advantage: brings language back into line regarding
"casting" vs. "spending" Extra Votes.  You spend an Alia, and receive a
Clout in return.  Unless you have a better offer. :)

i don't see Swann's Agoraverse as all that close to a SW-type
construct.  the Agoraverse was, at the same time, too complex and too
sparse.  the Universe Rules should be relatively open--in fact, i
think a very good idea is to create an Officer (say, Universe Master)
with broad discretionary powers to decide questions of mechanics,
leaving questions of policy to the Players.  if the Players object to
a decision of the Universe Master, they can either kick em out of
Office or order em by Rule or Directive to do what they want instead.

so what we have is enabling legislation that broadly specifies how the
system should work; at times the system will not work as legislated,
and in this case i think the best solution is _not_ to attempt to
rewind the system and rebuild it to its proper state, as we currently
do, but rather to accept the state of the system as it stands, fix the
implementation so it does conform with the law, and, when necessary,
make appropriate adjustments to the system so as to fairly and
equitably repair any injury resulting from the error.  i see this sort
of thing as a wonderful way to expand the judicial aspect of a Nomic,
especially in matters of equitable resolution and evidentiary
proceedings.  it will also force us to face head-on the lunacy of
strict Platonism.

one of my assumptions here is that the system exists and operated
independently of the Rules, but under their supervision.  in other
words, the enacting legislation should _not_ say "The Universe exists,
and has this and that property."; rather, it should say "There shall
be the Office of the Universe Master.  The Universe Master shall
create and oversee the operation of a Universe, which shall be
constructed in the following manner: blah blah blah".  when the
Universe enters a state which is not in compliance with the Rules, it
does not then cease to exist, nor do we get tied up in irritatingly
complex Platonic claims about perceptions of the true state of the
Universe.  Rather, the Universe Master has committed a non-retractable
breach of the Rules by allowing it to enter a forbidden state, which
can then be corrected by appropriate judicial action.  i am repeating
myself, so i'll stop.  i hope everyone gets the point.

i would recommend the use of the term "Player" (matching your
"sub-Player") for persons participating in the universe, and "Citizen"
(matching Agora's Player) for those who are participating in its
governance.

I have no complaints about the rhyme (differance is just cute) but I
definitely don't like the syllable counts. I simply cannot find the
rhythm.

Well, you did mention once that your pronunciation was bad..

This leads us to the question, should Silly Proposals be Protoed?

Greetings!

I return after almost a week sick, to find that the lists have gone *nuts*
- both discussion-wise (expect a number of dreadful Coren-comments on mail
from the last week over the next few days) and in terms of bouncing
messages.  :P

I need to reiterate something I have said numerous times before:
nomic-official and nomic-business are set so that ONLY subscribers may
post to them, and only from the subscribed address!  If I get messages
intended for these lists, I *will* forward them, but I cannot guarantee
prompt message processing; I am often gone these days for up to a week,
for one reason or another.

Right now, there are three people who are generating bounced mesages:
sefram, Murphy, and Andrew Bishop (Part of Xanadu).

The address zefram has been sending posts from is:
	<zefram@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>.
The closest thing I can find to this on the subscribed list is:
	> A.Main@dcs.warwick.ac.uk
zefram, is that you?  If it is, please update your subscription, or ask me
to do it for you.  If not, what address do you receive nomic mail at?

Messages from Andrew Bishop (Part of Xanadu) have been originating at:
	<onceler@brucehall20.anu.edu.au>
whereas he is subscribed to the lists (and registered) as:
	> b3015880%toscanini@anu.edu.au
Andrew, please make sure you submit messages to the n-o and n-b lists
*from the address at which you are subscribed*.  If you need help changing
your subscribed address, please ask.

Murphy is a somewhat more complex problem, and one I am not certain what
to do about.  He is subscribed at the address:
	> zvyezda@ix.netcom.com
while his e-mail comes from various addresses, all of the form:
	zvyezda@<machinename>.ix.netcom.com
Unfortunately, Netcom does not (and never has) properly handled domain
names when sending out e-mail (this problem of theirs has broken a lot of
systems), and majordomo's mungedomain function can't seem to handle the
way Netcom sends mail.  :/  I currently don't have a good fix for this
one.  Two or three work-arounds are 1) subscribe from another address
permanently; 2) if you have another address, but don't want to get n-o and
n-b mail there, set up a script file which sends a subscribe message,
sends out your "official" message, then unsubscribes you again; 3) leave
things the way they are, and wait for me to forward your mail back to the
list.

The bounced messages from these three people for the last three days will
be forwarded to the lists immediately following this message.  The three
net-spams which the filter caught will NOT be forwarded.  ;)  My apologies
for any inconvenience caused by the delay.

IN OTHER NEWS:

My personal list archives have been somewhat reformatted.  I currently
have complete copies of list traffic from approximately the beginning
of March 1996 through the present; older archives were lost due to
computer problems and lack of file space.  All of these are available as
gzip'd raw mail files, separated by list, and by month, at my anonymous
ftp site:

	ftp://ftp.teleport.com/users/coren/nomic/

In this location are the directories official, business, discussion,
majordomo, and internomic.  The first three should be obvious; majordomo
contains all of the subscribe and unsubscribe messages, and internomic
contains copies of all the traffic on the internomic mailing list since it
moved to its current location, just before the start of the current
internomic game.

I expect to be able to maintain about six month's archives for each of
these lists.

I also want to take this opportunity to extend a preliminary warning:
Teleport has been rumoured to be suffering both service-related and
financial problems over the last couple of months - I cannot predict what
this means for the lists.  In the (IMO) unlikely event that Teleport goes
under, the lists may disappear without warning.  More possible is a
pricing structure change in which list-owners will be charged an
additional fee for operating lists.  If that happens, I will be forced to
shut down the lists, since I cannot afford to pay more on
telecommunications bills than I am now, but I will have some warning
before that happens, if indeed it ever does.  Neither appears to be likely
at this point, but I felt it best to give a warning as early as possible.

Please feel free to address any list questions or comments you my have to
me.

Yr obt svt,

Coren, Not-Distributor and list owner

I wish to record a bit of Agora history in the making, and to ask a question.

The history is that Players Michael and elJefe met in real life at
Cambridge University on Thursday.  We lunched on sandwiches while sitting
on the wall in front of King's College, and Michael informed me of 2 new
CFJ's (possibly the first time that's happened without computer mediation).

My question: how many other Agorans have met face-to-face?  I recall
reading that there have been others, but perhaps that's beyond the scope of
the Archives. Anyone?

Regards,
-- elJefe

> There is an Internomic mailing list?

There is, indeed.  It is a low volume list on which all of the official
business and internal discussion for Internomic takes place.  The mailing
address is internomic@wilma.che.utexas.edu - I don't recall offhand what
the subscription address is... Andre?

In any case, what little traffic has passed through the list since its
inception is stored at:

	ftp://ftp.teleport.com/users/coren/nomic/internomic

if you want to take a look at it.

Not-Distributor Coren, completely unaffiliated with Internomic other than
being a Player of a member Nomic, Agora.

============================================================

Proposal 2696 (Swann, AI=1)

Rule 1007 "Default Salary of Officers" is amended by deleting the
last paragraph and replacing it with the following:

     "There shall be a Basic Officer Salary, which is equal to 10 Marks.
      Salaries are permitted to be expressed in terms of the Basic
      Salary.  Unless otherwise specified, the Salary for an Office
      shall be equal to the Basic Salary."

{Comment: Another idea, possibly subversive, is to set the Basic Salary
          By Directive.
      v2: Ditched COLAs and lowered the basic Salary.}

==================================================================
Rule 1607 shall be amended to read;

      There shall exist the Office of the Promotor.  The Promotor
      shall receive a weekly salary equal to 1.5 times the Basic
      Officer Salary.
==================================================================
Rule 1449 shall be amended to read;

      There shall exist the Office of Assessor.  The Assessor
      shall receive a weekly salary equal to 3 times the Basic
      Officer Salary.
==================================================================
Rule 889 shall be amended to read;

      There shall exist the Office of Clerk of the Courts.  The
      Clerk of the Courts shall receive a weekly salary equal to
      2 times the Basic Officer Salary.
==================================================================
Rule 559 shall be amended to read;

      There shall exist the Office of Registrar.  The Registrar
      shall receive a weekly salary equal to 1.5 times the Basic
      Officer Salary.
==================================================================
Rule 1051 shall be amended to read;

      There shall exist the Office of Rulekeepor.  The Rulekeepor
      shall receive a weekly salary equal to 2 times the Basic Officer
      Salary.

      The Rulekeepor shall maintain a complete list of the current
      Rules, and post this list to all Players at least once a week.
==================================================================
Rule 417 has its Title change from "The Nomic Archivist" to
"Duties of the Archivist"

Let the following rule be created; (Title; The Archivist)

      There shall exist the Office of Nomic Archivist.  The
      Archivist shall receive a weekly salary equal to 2 times the
      Basic Officer Salary.

Rule 417 is amended to read as follows;

      The duties of the Nomic Archivist shall be as follows:

         i) to record the passage and failure of Proposals,

        ii) to maintain the Historical Ruleset, a document which
            includes all rules ever to exist as part of the Agora
            Ruleset, annotated with the periods of time they were in
            effect, and what Proposals or Rules enacted them.

      iii) to maintain a list of Judgements and their case histories,

       iv) to maintain copies of prior Officer reports, and

        v) to maintain a list of game Winners in past games.

      The Archivist is free to comment on the historical records as e
      sees fit, but such commentary must be clearly delimited from the
      historical material.  The Archivist is free to design a
      classification method for the material e stores.

      The "historical record" of the Ruleset maintained by the
      Archivist is one that includes all rules ever part of the Agora
      Ruleset, annotated with information as to their ultimate fate,
      whether Repealed or Amended etc. This record of the Ruleset has
      no legal force.
==================================================================
Rule 1548 is amended to read as follows;

      There shall exist the Office of Banker.  The Banker
      shall receive a weekly salary equal to 2 times the Basic
      Officer Salary.

      The Banker shall maintain a record of all existing Currencies
      and their respective MUQs, Recordkeepors, and Mintors.
==================================================================
Rule 1436 is amended by replacing the text;

     "The Tabulator's salary shall be four Mils per Week."

with;

     "The Tabulator shall receive a weekly salary equal to 1.5 times the
      Basic Officer Salary."

============================================================

Proposal 2697 (Swann, AI=1)

Abolish the End of the Game

============================================================
Rule 459 is amended to read as follows;

     The Nomic Week begins at midnight, GMT, each Monday. Any
     automatic change in the state of the Game which must occur
     weekly occurs at the beginning of the Nomic Week. Any
     automatic change which must occur monthly occurs at midnight,
     GMT, on the first of the month.  Any automatic change which must
     occur quarterly occurs at midnight, GMT, on the first day of each
     calendar quarter.

     This Rule defers to any Rule that defines another explicit schedule 
     for events.  Any activity that must be performed at least weekly, 
     monthly, or quarterly, must occur at least once in the given
     period.

{Comment: Followed Vanyel's suggestions in subsuming the scheduling
          business into 459.}

============================================================
Rule 1043 is amended by replacing the text;

     "any attempts by em to reregister before a new Game has begun are 
     without effect; this Rule takes precedence over Rules which would 
     cause em to be reregistered before a new Game has begun."
with;
     "any attempts by em to reregister before the beginning of the next 
     month are without effect; this Rule takes precedence over Rules 
     which would cause em to be reregistered before the beginning of the 
     next month."

============================================================
{Comment: Rule 1608 is ommited because Steve has proposed recalculating
          the Mil monthly.}
============================================================
Rule 1542 is amended by replacing the text;

     "At the time there is a legal and correct announcement of a End of 
      the Game, all Players have their Style set to zero."
with;
     "At the beginning of every quarter, all Players have their Style 
      set to zero."

============================================================
Rule 1609 is amended by replacing the text;

     "i) There is a legal and correct announcement of a Game End."
with;
     "i) A new quarter has begun."
and the text;
     "If the Transition is occurring as a result of a Game End, the 
      Style used for this ordering is the Style the Players had 
      immediately prior to the legal announcement of the Game End."
with;
     "If the Transition is occurring as a result of the beginning of a 
      new quarter, the Style used for this ordering is the Style the 
      Players had immediately prior to the beginning of that quarter."
==============================================================
Rule 1498 is amended to read as follows;

      A Player Wins the Game if e is the only Immaculate Player, and e
      has correctly reported this fact to the Public Forum, provided
      that e did not Win in this manner within the three months prior
      to this announcement.
==============================================================
Rule 1622 is amended to read as follows;

      Players shall be permitted to forfeit the current Game by
      sending a notification to that effect to the Public Forum.
      Forfeiting the current Game is a Win-preventing condition which
      prevails from the time of such notification until either some
      other Player has won the Game, or until three months have elapsed
      from the time of the notification, whichever comes first.

      Being the only Active Player who has not forfeited the current
      Game constitutes a Win condition.
==============================================================
Rule 1433 is hereby repealed.
==============================================================
Rule 1638 is amended to read as follows;

      Whenever a Player is required to report that a Win has occurred,
      e shall do so by posting to the Public Forum the following
      information :
        i) The fact someone has won the Game
       ii) The date of the win, correct to within 36 hours
      iii) The cause of the win
       iv) The identity of the Player or Players who Won the Game

      Any communication pertaining to a Win shall be a legal and
      correct announcement of same if and only if it contains all
      required information.

{Comment; Deleted the language about Speakers, it's no longer
          relevant to this rule.}
===============================================================
Rule 388 is hereby repealed
===============================================================
Rule 1491 is amended by replacing the text;
     "Game Ends"
with;
     "Player Wins the Game by Tokens"

{Comment; works on both the current Rule and my proposed new one.}
===============================================================
Rule 1492 is amended by replacing the word;
     "Game"
with;
     "month"
===============================================================
Rule 1441 is amended by replacing the word;
     "Game"
with;
     "quarter"
===============================================================
Rule 681 is amended by replacing the text;

     "and e shall further be prevented from Winning until the start of 
      the next Game."
with;
     "and e shall further be prevented from nominating eimself for 
      Speaker-Elect until the start of the next quarter."

{Comment: This needs some explanation, I've read the intent of the
          original rule as a means to prevent the abdicating speaker
          from assuming speakership again in the next game-- this rule
          being left over from when a Win=Speakership, and from when
          Speakership prevented one from winning.  The provision as
          amended makes more sense to me, as the Game stands today.}
===============================================================
Rule 1581 is amended to read as follows;

     Upon the commencement of each new quarter, the Player who holds the 
     Office of Speaker-Elect immediately becomes Speaker, and the old  
     Speaker ceases to be Speaker.

============================================================

Proposal 2698 (Morendil, AI=2)

Silly Walk #1

There once was a lad from France
Who saw Silliness as his major chance
That in eir Treasury one more
Precious EV than just before
Be Directed to appear, what a difference !

============================================================

Proposal 2699 (Swann, AI=1)

Removing the Speaker via Referendum

Let the following Rule Be created; (Title: Tainting the Speaker.)

     A Speaker shall become Tainted when a Referendum calling for the 
     Tainting of the Speaker passes. Any Active Player is permitted to 
     call such a Referendum at any time, by requesting such to the 
     Public Forum.

     This Referendum must name the offending Speaker, and if that Player 
     is Speaker upon passage of this Referendum, that Speaker is Tainted.

     For this Referendum the default procedure for Referenda is modified 
     as follows: Vote Collector is the Registrar, Voting Entities do not 
     include the Speaker, and its Adoption Ratio is 2.

{Comment: This is a replacement for removing a Speaker via directive.
          This is by analogy with the Impeachment Rules.  It's Referenda
          for the same reason, and it uses 1648, which  does not exclude 
          additional means of a Speaker becoming Tainted.  IMO it is a 
          nicer solution than just kicking the speaker out, in that it 
          allows an election for S-E if we need one.
      v2: Minor language fixes.}

============================================================

Proposal 2700 (Swann, AI=1, Disinterested)

A minor fix for infractions-- a disinterested Proposal.

Rule 1503 is amended by replacing both instances of the word "Officer" with the
word "Player"

{Comment: I failed to realize that the Infraction Rules, in assuming an
          Offer Reported everything, had broken a few Rules (Not in any
          really noticable way, but there are a few Rules that require
          non-Officer Players to report Infractions.) this fixes the
          problem.}

============================================================

Proposal 2701 (elJefe, AI=2)

elJefe's Silly Proposal

  Though not this week's Personne Fou,
  I will happily enter the queue,
  Where loopholes abound
  EV's are to be found
  So send one on to me when you're through!

============================================================

Proposal 2702 (elJefe, AI=1)

elJefe's Serious Proposal

Amend the Rule titled "The Silly Proposal" created by Proposal 2673 by
appending the following sentence to its first paragraph:

  No Proposals by players other than the Silly Player are Silly Proposals
  for the purpose of this Rule, nor are any further Proposals offered by the
  Silly Player in a Nomic Week in which e has already proposed a Silly Proposal.

============================================================

Proposal 2703 (Steve, AI=1)

Encourage larger Groups

[Comment: the aim of this Proposal is to encourage larger Groups, 
say of 5 Players, by providing a significant incentive for groups
(small 'g') of 5 Players to band together into a Group. I regard
the prospect of 3 extra votes as being a significant incentive.
This is greater than than the 2 extra votes currently offerred to 
Groups of 3 Players, but actually represents a small decrease in
extra votes per Group member, down from 2/3 to 3/5 of a vote.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 721 be amended by deleting from it
the text which currently reads:

      If a given Group is a Voting Entity, then it shall be entitled
      to cast Vote(s) only as specified by its Ordinances.  If the
      Ordinances of the Group do not specify how the Group shall cast
      its Vote(s), it may not do so.

      A Group is not entitled to cast Votes on a Proposal if it did
      not exist at the beginning of the Voting Period of that
      Proposal.

      A Group with fewer than three Members is not entitled to cast
      Votes.

      The Vizier of a Group is responsible to communicate the Group's
      Votes to the Assessor.

[Comment: to be replaced by a new Rule describing Group voting.]

Be it further resolved that a Rule, entitled "Group Voting", be
created with the following text:

      A Group shall be entitled to cast up to three votes on a
      Proposal if and only if the following conditions are met:

      (i)  the Group's Ordinances specify how the Group is to
           cast its vote(s) on that Proposal;
      (ii) the Group has at least five Members, and had at
           least five Members at the commencement of the
           Voting Period of that Proposal.

      The Vizier of the Group is responsible for communicating
      the Group's votes to the Assessor.

      Other Rules may specify the conditions under which a Group
      may be entitled to cast more than three votes on a Proposal.

[Comment: condenses and simplifies the provisions deleted from Rule
721. Note this change: whereas under current legislation, a Group
need only have existed at the beginning of the VP and now have 3
Members in order to vote (even if it had only 2 Members at the
beginning of VP), under the new legislation, a Group will need to
have had 5 members since the beginning of the VP in order to
vote. This change is necessary to prevent a minor scam in which
one Player votes in one Group, resigns from that Group, and quickly
joins another Group (with only 4 Members), entitling it to vote
as well. Cf Rule 206, with which this new Rule cooperates well.
The last provision allows for things such as the Unity vote.]

============================================================

Proposal 2704 (Andre, AI=1, Disinterested)

Internomic Quorum

Amend Rule 1632 by changing the text that now reads:

      * Quorum: If the Referendum does not reach Quorum, and the
      number of votes FOR is more than 3 times as large as the number
      of votes AGAINST, the Referendum is undecided.

by:
      * Quorum: Quorum is equal to 1/4 of the number of Active Players.

============================================================

Proposal 2705 (Swann, AI=1)

Modernizing the Distributor

Rule 478 is hereby amended by replacing each instance of the word
"Distributor" with the word "Registrar" and each instance of the word
"Distributor's" with the word "Registrar's"

The categories of rule 796 and 514 are changed from
"The Distributor and the Assistant"
to
"The Registrar"

Rule 796 has its Title change from
"The Distributor"
to
"Using the Registrar as the Public Forum"

Rule 796 is hereby amended to read as follows:

     Whenever a Player is required to post something to the Public
     Forum (or to send it to all Players) e is permitted, instead, to
     send the message to the Registrar with some indication that it
     should be forwarded to all Players. The Registrar shall send such
     messages to all Players as soon as possible and in the order
     received. This Rule shall take precedence over all Rules which
     require a Player to send something to all Players or to the Public
     Forum.

Rule 514 has its Title change from
"Keep the Distributor Informed of Your Address"
to
"Keep the Registrar Informed of Your Address"

Rule 514 is hereby amended to read as follows:

     All Players shall notify the Registrar of their preferred email 
     address(es). Should this address change, that Player shall notify 
     the Registrar of this change. If a Player fails to notify the 
     Registrar of a change of address, the Registrar shall not be 
     responsible for any mail which did not reach that Player.

Let the following Rule be created; (Title: The Distributor)

     There is a Unique Patent Title of Distributor.  It shall be 
     possessed by that person most responsible for the maintenance of
     the Public Forum, as designated by the Registrar.  If the 
     Distributor is a Player, that person shall be awarded two Mils 
     every Nomic Week in recognition of eir service.  This Mark transfer 
     shall be detected and Reported by the Registrar.

     The Registrar is obliged to keep the Distributor informed of the
     e-mail addresses of all Players, as well as to inform the
     Distributor of any address changes as soon as possible after e
     learns of it.

{Comment: This fixes the Rules to recognize that the Distributor is an
     extra-game entity, and treats eim as such.  The Distributor is not 
     an Office any more, but a title given to the person who keeps our 
     lists in order, and rewards said person if e is a Player.  This 
     keeps the Distributor semi-permanent, and makes more sense as a 
     reflection of reality.}

============================================================

Proposal 2706 (Swann, AI=1)

Speaker's Right to Call Elections

Let the following Rule Be created; (Title: The Right to call Elections.)

     Any Speaker who is not Tainted has the Right to call Elections.  
     This is the Right to declare any number of Offices to be held 
     temporarily.  This Right is exercised by posting an announcement in
     the Public Forum that both lists a number of Offices currently held
     in normal fashion, and declares that the Speaker is exercising eir
     Right to call these Elections.  If the Speaker posts such a
     message, is not Tainted at the time of posting, and has not
     exercised this Right since e last became Speaker, all such Offices
     listed in this post are then held temporarily.

{Comment: It might be interesting to introduce a dash of parlimentarism
     into the structure of the game.  This would give the Speaker the 
     power to attempt to gain a number of like-thinking Officers to 
     accompany eim in assuming power.  Note that any given Speaker can 
     only do this once in eir term, and the given Officers can certainly 
     re-nominate themselves, so it isn't an overwhelming power, but it 
     offers some significant impact to the Speaker.}

============================================================

Proposal 2707 (Swann, AI=1)

The Speaker's Vote

Let the Following Rule be created; (Title: The Speaker's Vote)

     Any Speaker who is not Tainted is permitted to, once in any given
     Nomic Week, choose one specific Proposal (that e is otherwise
     eligible to vote for) and cast one vote in addition to any others
     e is permitted to cast on that Proposal.

     This Rule does not increase the maximum allowable votes that can be
     cast by a Voting Entity.

{Comment: Replacing some of the Champion's Reward, since assuming
          the Speakership is no longer a result of a win. Part of increasing the
          power of the speaker.}


============================================================

Proposal 2708 (Swann, AI=1)

Patronage

Let the Following Rule be created; (Title: The Right of Patronage)

     A Speaker who is not Tainted has the Right of Patronage.  This 
     Right is the authority to, once a week, order the award of specific 
     currencies from the Bank to specific Players, only as specified in 
     this Rule.

     Once each Nomic Week a Speaker can exercise this Right by sending a 
     post to the Public Forum which contains the following information;

       i) A value of currency that is not in excess of either 5 Mils or
          1 Extra Vote. These are the only permitted currencies.
      ii) The name of a Player who has not received such an award in the
          prior month, and who is not Speaker.
     iii) The reason for the transfer.

     Such awards are only permitted to recognize acts the Speaker 
     believes to be of benefit of the Agora community, acts that the 
     Speaker believes to exceed the call of duty, or acts that the 
     Speaker believes to be of extreme sacrifice for the good of the 
     Game.

     The Speaker detects and reports the currency transfers due to this 
     Rule, and the post exercising this Right shall also be the 
     Speaker's notification of this transfer to the appropriate 
     Recordkeepor.

{Comment: This is meant to be close to Kudos in sprit, and to give the
          Speaker a non-trivial means by which e may influence the
          course of the game.}

============================================================

Proposal 2709 (Swann, AI=1)

The Speaker's Gratuity

Let the Following Rule be created; (Title: The Speaker's Gratuity)

     Every month the Speaker shall receive a gratuity of two Extra
     Votes.  This gratuity shall be awarded upon the end of each
     month in which a single Player served as Speaker. In any month
     where more than one Player served as Speaker, this gratuity shall
     not be awarded. This currency transfer is detected and reported by
     the Registrar.

{Comment: Decoupling Speakership and Winning did have the side-effect of
          removing some of the rewards of being Speaker. (Assuming
          Speakership no longer means a Champion's Reward.)  This gives
          the speaker back some of what was taken away, to encourage
          service-- it is also deferred to emphasize that the reward is
          _for_ service, not just being elected.}

============================================================

Proposal 2710 (Steve, AI=1, Disinterested)

The Plural of 'Mil' is 'Mil'!

Be it hereby resolved that Rules 1007, 1607, 1449, 1451, 833, 947,
889, 1567, 1568, 591, 1565, 1572, 1447, 1505, 559, 1051, 417, 1548,
1521, 1540, 1624, 1436, 1440, and 1441 be amended by replacing in them
every occurrence of the word 'Mils' by an occurrence of the word 'Mil'.

Proposal 2662. So there! :-P]

Proposal 2711 (Morendil, AI=1)

New Ways To Win (1)

Create a Rule (titled "Win by Proposals") reading :

For those who care, this Proposal eliminates 19 lines.  "Vote" is still
overloaded, but now only means: the opinion of an Entity on a Proposal,
irrespective of that Entity's Clouts; and the entire voting process for
a given proposal.

As usual, comments are welcome.

PROTO-PROPOSAL: Eliminate "vote" ambiguity.

PREFACE

    Due to minor confusions regarding the terminology surrounding
    the Voting Procedure, a slight rearrangement of terms shall
    occur.  In general, the following transformations will occur:
	Extra Votes will be renamed to "Alia".
	The concept of "Voting Entities" will be abolished.
	"Clouts" will be the units of voting power; they correspond to
		the total number of votes one possesses (regular or
		Extra), currently.  Each Player will automatically get
		one Clout per Proposal.
	"Voters" will now be called "Peers".

    A side goal of this Proposal is to begin simplifying the Ruleset
    by including summary statements in Rules, which can not be
    construed as binding, but which provide a broad statement about
    the way the rule works.  Such statements are signalled by phrases
    like "In general,..." or "Generally speaking,...".

SECTION I
Changing the misnomer "Voter"

    All occurrences of the word "Voter" shall be replaced with
    "Peer", and "Voters" with "Peers", in the following Rules:
    103, 112, 1042, and 1043.

    In addition, the Title of Rule 103 shall be changed to "The
    Speaker and the Peers".

SECTION IIa
The Basics of the Alia/Clout system

    Rule 206 ("Voting Entities and Votes") shall have its Title
    changed to "Clouts and Voting", and shall be Amended to read as
    follows:

      The Clout (plural "Clouts") is an Agoran Entity.  Each Clout is
      possessed by exactly one Entity, and is associated with one
      Proposal.  Clouts may not be transferred.

      Generally speaking, the number of Clouts an Entity possesses
      indicates that Entity's influence on the Vote.

      When a Proposal is Promoted, each Player and each Group with at
      least three Players receives one Clout associated with that
      Proposal.  These Clouts are created.

      Clouts are said to be Cast For, Against, or Neutral to their
      Proposal, based on the Vote of the Entity which possesses them.

      No Entity may ever possess more than five Clouts associated with
      any one Proposal.

(15/12)

    Rule 1477 ("Extra Votes") shall have its Title changed to "Aliae",
    and shall be Amended to read as follows:

      The Alia (plural "Aliae") is a Currency.  The MUQ of the Alia is
      1.  The Recordkeepor of the Alia is the Assessor.  The Mintor of
      the Alia is the Mint.

      Generally speaking, Aliae are used to increase influence on a
      Vote.

(3/5)

    Rule 1442 ("Using Extra Votes") shall have its Title changed to
    "Spending Aliae", and shall be Amended to read as follows:

      In general, a Player may spend one Alia to receive one Clout on
      a specified Proposal.

      Aliae are spent when an Entity notifies the Assessor that e is
      spending an Alia, and for which Proposal it is spent.  When an
      Entity spends an Alia, one Alia is transferred from that Entity
      to the Bank, and one Clout associated with the spent-on Proposal
      is created in the possession of the Entity.

      An Alia is not spent if a Vote on the specified Proposal is not
      currently in progress, or if the spending Entity already has
      more than eir maximum Clouts on the specified Proposal.  This
      maximum is ordinarily 2, but may be raised as specified in other
      Rules.  Only Players and Groups may spend Aliae.

      All transfers required by this Rule shall be detected and
      reported by the Assessor.

(14/14)

    Rule 1547 is Repealed.

(5/0)

SECTION IIb
The Voting Process

    Rule 683 ("Legal Votes") shall be Amended to read as follows:

      A Vote which is Cast is either For, Against, or Neutral to a
      Proposal.  Any obvious synonym to these is acceptable.

      A Vote is Cast when an Entity's Executor sends that Entity's
      Vote to the Assessor.  Other rules may specify Vote timing of
      Entities without Executors.

      A Vote on a Proposal is legally Cast if it is Cast during the
      Voting Period of that Proposal.

(13/7)

   Rule 955 ("Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal") shall have its Title
   changed to "Proposal Adoption" and shall be Amended to read as
   follows:

     When the Voting Period on a Proposal has ended, the Proposal shall
     be assigned a Voting Index, as follows.  If the Proposal received
     no Clouts Against and at least one Clout For, the Voting Index is
     Unanimity.  Otherwise, the Voting Index shall be the total Clouts
     cast For the Proposal divided by the total Clouts cast Against.

     If the Voting Index is greater than the Adoption Index for a given
     Proposal, or if both equal Unanimity, the Proposal passes.
     Otherwise, it fails.

(11/8)

    Rule 208 ("End of the Voting Period") shall be Amended by replacing
    the word "Votes" with the phrase "Votes and Clouts".

(3/3)

SECTION III
Renaming EVs and bootstrapping Aliae

    All occurrences of the term "Extra Vote" or "EV" shall be replaced
    with "Alia", and "Extra Votes" or "EVs" with "Aliae", in the
    text and Titles of the following Rules: 1047, 1465, 1521, 1525,
    1540, and 1543.

    The following Rule shall be Created:

      For every Treasury, the number of Aliae in that Treasury is set
      equal to the number of Extra Votes which were in the Treasury
      prior to the passage of the Proposal which enacted this Rule.

      Once this is accomplished, this Rule repeals itself.

(0/4)

SECTION IV
Inactivity

    Rule 1584 ("Absolvement of Duty for On Hold Players") shall be
    Amended to read as follows:

      An On Hold Player is not permitted to make Proposals, or hold
      Office, and cannot be required by the Rules to perform any duty
      or action, unless that Rule specifically states that it can
      require On Hold Players to perform actions.

      This Rule takes precedence over every other Rule.

(5/5)

    The following Rule ("Clouts and Inactivity") shall be created:
    
      When a Player goes On Hold, every Clout possessed by em shall be
      destroyed.  When a Player is On Hold, e receives no Clouts for
      any reason.  When a Player comes Off Hold, e receives one Clout
      for every Proposal for which a Vote is in progress.

(0/4)

SECTION V
Powers

    Rule 1522 ("The Power of Influence") shall be Amended to read as
    follows:

      There is a Power called the Power of Influence. A Player on
      whom the Power of Influence is cast is called an Influential
      Player. The effect of the Power of Influence is to increase
      the maximum number of Clouts which the Influential Player may
      possess for a single Proposal, specified by the Caster, called
      the Influenced Proposal. The maximum number of Clouts which may
      be possessed by the Influential Player for the Influenced
      Proposal may be increased to 3, 4, or 5, depending on the price
      last paid to the Bank in order to purchase the Power. The
      purchase price of the Power of Influence increases according to
      the extent of the Influence granted by the use of the Power, and
      this greater influence is granted by the Power of Influence
      only if the Bank is paid for it, as set out below:

      A maximum of 3 Clouts :  10 Mil
      A maximum of 4 Clouts :  25 Mil
      A maximum of 5 Clouts :  50 Mil

      A Player casts the Power of Influence by sending a message to
      the Assessor specifying which player is to be the Influential
      Player, and which Proposal is to be the Influential Proposal.

      If this Rule conflicts in its effects with those of another
      Rule defining a specific Power, then the conflict shall be
      resolved according to the Rule for determining precedence
      among Powers.

(23/23)

    Rule 1523 ("The Power of Quiet") shall be Amended to read as
    follows:

      There is Power called the Power of Quiet. There are 3 Quiet
      Cards. The purchase price for each of these Cards is 5 Mil.
      The effect of this Power is to prevent the Player on whom it is
      cast, called the Quiet Player, from spending any Aliae on a
      Proposal specified by the Caster, called the Quiet Proposal.
      The Power of Quiet may not be cast by the Assessor.

      A Quiet Player is not permitted to spend Aliae on their Quiet
      Proposal. If a Quiet Player has already spent Aliae on their
      Quiet Proposal at the time they become Quiet, then all but one
      of that Player's Clouts for that Proposal are destroyed, and an
      equal number of Aliae is transferred from the Bank to that
      Player.  The Assessor is responsible for detecting and reporting
      these transfers.

      The Caster casts the Power of Quiet by sending a message to the
      Assessor unambiguously identifying the Player who is to be
      the Quiet Player, and the Proposal which is to be the Quiet
      Proposal. Unless this condition is met, the Power is not
      legally cast.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which describe the
      circumstances in which Players may legally spend Aliae, with the
      exception of Rules which describe the effects of other Powers.
      This Rule also takes precedence over other Rules which describe
      the effects of legally spent Aliae.

      If this Rule conflicts in its effects with those of another
      Rule defining a specific Power, then the conflict shall be
      resolved according to the Rule for determining precedence
      among Powers.

(28/28)

SECTION VI
Miscellaneous

    Rule 833 ("Reward or Penalty for Proposing") shall be Amended to
    read as follows:

      In general, a Proposer receives Mils equal to the margin of
      passage of eir Proposal.  This is often termed "F-A".

      At the end of the Voting Period on a Proposal, the Assessor
      shall calculate the number of Clouts cast by Players For a
      Proposal, minus the number of Clouts cast by Players Against a
      Proposal.

      If this number is positive, and the Proposal was not
      Disinterested, the Proposer receives that many Mils.

      If this number is negative, the Proposer loses that many Mils.

      The Assessor shall report the transfers required by this Rule no
      later than the announcement of the results of the Proposal.

(16/11)

    Rule 1653 ("Groups and Unity Vote") shall be Amended to read as
    follows:

      In general, a Group with a unanimous opinion can gain greater
      influence by declaring a Unity Vote.

      If a Group has Clouts for a Proposal, its Vizier may declare a
      Unity Vote on that Proposal by notifying the Assessor.  When a
      Unity Vote is declared, two Aliae are transferred from the Group
      to the Bank.

      If all members of the Group cast the same Vote as the Group
      itself, the Group's Clout maximum is raised to three, and the
      Group receives two Clouts associated with that Proposal.  In
      addition, two Aliae are transferred to the Group.

      If at least one Group member does not cast the same Vote as the
      Group, all the Group's Clouts for that Proposal are destroyed.

If you're going to revamp the whole system, can we ditch the word "Power?"
There's an overlap with the "Powers" terminology-wise, and there are
no shortage of synonymous terms.  (Efficacy comes to mind, and is actually
closer to the meaning IMO)

Mmmm.  I don't like the term, but can't think of something better at the
moment.

This may be somewhat dangerous as worded.  I can think of, say, adopting
a Rule whose effacacy is partally based on non-substantive properties.  The
exsitance of any one such rule (say a bizzare one which clames precidence
based on alphabetic order of Rule Titles) might have a global effect of
changing non-substantive properties into substantive ones.  IMO not a good
thing.  Also, what would this do to Injunctions on inerpreting Rules?
I think this can't be an overly general definition without running into
problems.

Not a Good Thing.  Capitalization matters, even in English.  (Polish and

Note again, my comments on the overbroad definition of substantive properties.
If Rules exist whose application to other Rules depends on Rule Categories
then Rule Categories become a substantive property and the Rulekeepor is
subject to the precidence-- or substantial lack of it-- of this Rule.

That last provision is too broad.  It might forbid, for instance, the
adoption of a Unique Patent Title.  You need to specify the dfifference
between applying a liability _in the past_ and applying a liability
_for someting that occured in the past_.  You wish the former, the wording
implies the latter, an breaks a lot of rules.


All and all, not a henious as I expected it to be :)
However, IMO, the redefinition of Rule Changes, and the Retroactivity
propblems I've mentioned are truly major deficits, and
would prevent me from voting for the Proposal.  But this is a good job.
(I'm now off to look at agents for comparison's sake :)

There are lots of words that could fit quite well, I think.  How about
"Strength" ?   Or "Rank" ?  I could get used to saying "A Rule of Rank 3",
as easily as I now say "A rule of MI=3"...

"Instrument" is legalistic-sounding, but none the worse for that. I like it too.

Yes, recall that it refers specifically to text quoted from a Rule.  Unless
we use "Polish" and "polish" in otherwise identical sentences in the same
Rule, I think it will not cause us trouble.

Actually, "liability" is subject to misinterpretation here; I'd rather that
you used "penalty".  For example, there were a number of times when I was
required to do something by the Rules (appoint the Tabulator when I was
Speaker), but the Rule was amended so that I didn't have to. Is that
responsibility a "liability"? (speaking loosely, I thought it was!)

By and large, I think this is an admirable proposal.  I think that once the
details are ironed out I will be willing to support it.

So, now I am to decide whether or not Scott Goehring and Kelly are the same?
Nice game this is...

Given eir reaction to your COE it doesn't seem like Scott Goehring emself is
willing to provide the crucial information, so I have to make a guess myself.
No absolute certainty can be given, but the combination of:
(1) coming from the email-domain poverty.bloomington.in.us
(2) making a proto on reform scale (that is, a proto that is more than just a
    small change on 1 or 2 rules) within minutes of entering the game
(3) giving evidence of feeling emself at home in Agora which is found rarely,
    if at all, in new Players

makes me believe the chance that this indeed is the same person as the one
that used to be the Player called Kelly, so I admit the COE. The relevant
part of the report will become:

Scott		--	10

As an addition I will say that I will reverse this again if Scott posts a
message to the Public Forum in which e unambiguously states that e is not
Kelly. This on the assumption that if e were Kelly e would not on purpose
tell lies on the Public Forum...

I hereby make one of the following transfers of Kudos;

If Scott<>Kelly, then I transfer one Kudo from Andre for making rash
assumptions about identity, to Kojen, for actually coming out of hiding.

If Scott=Kelly, then I transfer one Kudo from Scott for being obtuse, and
transfer it to elJefe for doing such a good job as Wizard.

Boy, did I see that one coming a mile away.

My first response: do we have to?  I don't think so--we merely have to
convince the Judge of the relevant CFJ, and perhaps the Appeals Court.

This should be interesting.  I'm going to go root around for evidence.

(By the way, Scott: Why "Kelly Martin"?  Only person I ever heard of
with that name was a soap opera star....)

Perhaps we need to legislate a Player as the Recordkeepor of eir identity,
then we could make an FOIA request :P

you're thinking of Kellie Martin, formerly of "Life Goes On".  she
does made-for-TV movies (her shot at a starring role in a series,
"Christie", only lasted one season).

i am not aware of any substantial benefit (aside from a few Kudos,
which don't particularily interest me) which might accrue to me as a
consequence of such misidentification.  as far as i can tell, Kelly
left the game with no Blots, and Players do not retain any other
characteristic on their return other than Kudos.  i have no intention
of Claiming any Errors with respect to Kudos which may arise as a
result of variant theories regarding my identity, but this lack of
action should be taken only as evidence that i do not much concern
myself with Kudos, and not as evidence of any admission or denial on
my part of any allegations regarding my prior identity, if either.  by
the way, i don't own a dog, my dog was at the vet, and his dog
attacked my dog first.  so there.

cheerz!

We could, however, do a VOC on the Herald's report to make those 10 Kudos
stick. (-:C

Incidentally, I am pretty sure I have seen Scott Goehring before, some
time ago. Possibly it was Kelly who used the address sgoehring@.. for a
while, as a new Player..
