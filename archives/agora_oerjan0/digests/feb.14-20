THE CURRENT RULESET
Part 1 of 3 

Rules are listed as follows, where NNN represents the Rule number:

========================================

Rule NNN (Immutable or Mutable)
My Own Unofficial Title

NNN.  Semi-Official Rule Title, If There Is One

      Text of Rule

[Note:  I have annotated some Rules to clarify their interpretation.
However, these annotations have no legal force in and of themselves.]

========================================



========================================

Rule 101 (Immutable)
Obey the Rules

101.

      All Players must always abide by all the Rules then in effect,
      in the form in which they are then in effect.  The Rules in the
      Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the first game.
      The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (Immutable) and
      201-219 (Mutable).

========================================

Rule 102 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Rules

102.

      Initially Rules in the 100's are Immutable and Rules in the
      200's are Mutable.  Rules subsequently Enacted or Transmuted
      (that is, changed from Immutable to Mutable or vice versa) may
      be Immutable or Mutable regardless of their Numbers, and Rules
      in the Initial Set may be Transmuted regardless of their Numbers.

========================================

Rule 103 (Immutable)
The Speaker and Voters

103.

      At any time, each Player shall be either a Voter or the Speaker;
      no Player may simultaneously be a Voter and a Speaker. At any
      time, there shall be exactly one Speaker. The term "Player" in
      the Rules shall specifically include both the Voters and the
      Speaker.

========================================

Rule 104 (Immutable)
First Speaker

104.

      The Speaker for the first game shall be Michael Norrish.

========================================

Rule 105 (Immutable)
What Is a Rule Change?

105.

      A Rule Change is any of the following:  (1) the enactment,
      repeal, or amendment of a mutable Rule; or (2) the transmutation
      of an immutable Rule into a mutable Rule or vice versa.
        (Note:  This definition implies that, at least initially, all
      new Rules are Mutable; Immutable Rules, as long as they are
      Immutable, may not be Amended or Repealed; Mutable Rules, as long
      as they are Mutable, may be Amended or Repealed; any Rule of any
      status may be Transmuted; no Rule is absolutely immune to change.)

========================================

Rule 106 (Immutable)
Adopting Proposed Rule Changes

106.

      All Rule Changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on.
      They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required
      number of votes and Quorum is achieved.

========================================

Rule 107 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Must Be Written Down

107.

      Any proposed Rule Change must be written down (or otherwise
      communicated in print media) before it is voted on. If adopted,
      it must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.

========================================

Rule 108 (Immutable)
When May Rule Changes Take Effect?

108.

      No Rule Change may take effect earlier than the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording
      explicitly states otherwise.  No rule change may have retroactive
      application.

========================================

Rule 109 (Immutable)
Rule Numbers

109.

      The Speaker shall give each proposed Rule Change a Number for
      reference.  The numbers shall begin with 301, and each Rule
      Change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next
      successive integer, whether or not the Proposal is adopted.
        If a Rule is Repealed and Reenacted, it receives the Number of
      the Proposal to Reenact it.  If a Rule is Amended or Transmuted,
      it receives the Number of the Proposal to Amend or Transmute it.
 
========================================

Rule 110 (Immutable)
Transmutation of Rules

110.

      Rule Changes that Transmute Immutable Rules into Mutable Rules
      may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among Votes
      legally cast.  Transmutation shall not be implied, but must be
      stated explicitly in a Proposal to take effect.
 
========================================

Rule 111 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Conflicts

111.

      In a conflict between a Mutable and an Immutable Rule, the
      immutable Rule takes precedence and the Mutable Rule shall be
      entirely void.  For the purposes of this Rule a Proposal to
      Transmute an Immutable Rule does not "conflict" with that
      Immutable Rule.
 
========================================

Rule 112 (Immutable)
Winning Must Be by Points

112.

      The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered
      from achieving n points to any other state of affairs.  The
      magnitude of n and the means of earning points may be changed,
      and Rules that establish a Winner when play cannot continue may
      be Enacted and (while they are mutable) be Amended or Repealed.
 
========================================

Rule 113 (Immutable)
Players May Always Forfeit

113.

      A Player always has the option to forfeit the Game rather than
      continue to play or incur a Game penalty.  No penalty worse than
      losing, in the judgment of the Player to incur it, may be
      imposed.

========================================

Rule 114 (Immutable)
At Least One Mutable Rule

114.

      There must always be at least one Mutable Rule.  The adoption of
      Rule Changes must never become completely inpermissible.

========================================

Rule 115 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Which Change Rule-Changing Rules Allowed

115.

      Rule Changes that affect Rules needed to allow or apply
      Rule Changes are as permissible as other Rule Changes.  Even
      Rule Changes that amend or repeal their own authority are
      permissible.  No Rule Change or type of move is impermissible
      solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a
      Rule.

========================================

Rule 116 (Immutable)
Permissibility of the Unprohibited

116.

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
      and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
      which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly or
      implicitly permits it.

========================================

Rule 201 (Mutable)
Quorum

201.

      Quorum for a proposed Rule Change is defined to be 20% of Voters
      at the beginning of the prescribed Voting Period for that
      Proposal.

========================================

Rule 206 (Mutable)
One Voter, One Vote

206.

      Each Voter has exactly one Vote.  The Speaker may not Vote.

========================================

Rule 208 (Mutable)
End of the Voting Period

208.

      At the end of the prescribed Voting Period on a Proposal, the
      Speaker shall reveal all Votes legally cast on that Proposal. If
      the Speaker's consent may be required for a Proposal to be
      adopted then the Speaker should indicate at that time whether or
      not e gives eir consent.  If the Speaker does not explicitly
      indicate that e refuses to consent to the Proposal, it shall be
      assumed that e consents.

========================================

Rule 212 (Mutable)
Resolving Rule Conflicts

212.

      If two or more Mutable Rules conflict with one another, or if
      two or more Immutable Rules conflict with one another, then the
      Rule with the lowest ordinal Number takes precedence.
        If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of rule) or takes
      precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.
        If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

========================================

Rule 217 (Mutable)
Judgements Must Accord with the Rules

217.

      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however, if
      the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the Statement
      to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider Game Custom and the
      Spirit of the Game before applying other standards.

========================================

Rule 312 (Mutable)
A Point for Voting

312.

      If a Voter votes, he gets one (1) point at the end of the Voting
      Period.

========================================

Rule 355 (Mutable)
Determining When a Rule Has Been Broken

355.  Determining when a Rule has been broken:

      If a Player believes that any Player has not abided by a Rule
      then in effect, in the form in which it was then in effect, then
      the Player may invoke Judgement on a Statement to that effect.
      However,
        -The Accusing player immediately loses 5 points.
        -No Player may be so Accused of actions committed before the
         adoption of this Rule or more than 30 days before the
         Accusation.
        -No Player may be so Accused more than once concerning the
         same committed act, unless the last such Accusation has been
         judged UNDECIDED.
        -The following exception takes precedence over previous Rules 
         concerning Judgement: Neither Accusing nor Accused Player may
         act as Judge for the Accusation; in any case where this would
         occur, a random Voter, neither Accuser nor Accused, shall be
         Judge.
      If the Statement is judged TRUE, the Accused Player has been
      convicted of breaking the Rule.  If the Statement is judged
      FALSE, the Accused Player has been acquitted of breaking the
      Rule.

========================================

Rule 376 (Mutable)
When Does a Rule Change Take Effect?

376.  Time that a rule change takes effect:

      An adopted rule change takes full effect at the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it.
      The moment of the completion of the vote is defined by the date
      and time given in the line starting with "Date:" of the Nomic
      listserver message send by the Benevolent Speaker, announcing
      the result of the vote on the corresponding proposal.

========================================

Rule 388 (Mutable)
Game Status When a New Game Begins

388.  Starting a new Game:

      Whenever a new game of Nomic is begun, the status of the new
      Game when it begins shall be the same as the status of the old
      Game when it ended, in all respects where the Rules do not
      decide otherwise.

========================================

Rule 399 (Mutable)
The Office of the Rulekeepor

399.  The Office of the Rulekeepor:

      Let there be an Officer known as the Rulekeepor.
      The Rulekeepor shall maintain a complete list of the current
      Rules, and post this list to all Players at least once a week.
      
      So long as the Rulekeepor is in Office, the Speaker is not
      required to maintain or distribute the Rules.

========================================

Rule 402 (Mutable)
Transfer of Power of the Mighty Speaker

402.  Transfer of Power of the Mighty Speaker:

      When one Mighty Speaker is yielding his Office to another, the
      following procedure shall be followed:
      
       1) The Present Mighty Speaker shall forward copies of all
          necessary materials for the performance of his Office to the
          Prospective Mighty Speaker.
       2) The Prospective Mighty Speaker shall acknowledge the receipt
          of said materials.
       3) The Present Mighty Speaker shall post a message to the
          listserv announcing the official transfer of power, which
          occurs at the "Date:" of the Present Mighty Speaker's
          posting.
      
      The Present Mighty Speaker remains in Office until the successful
      completion of step 3.

========================================

Rule 404 (Mutable)
Legality of Proposals

404.  Legality of Proposals:

      As long as a Proposal satisfies all requirements in place at the
      time of its making for the proper making of Proposals, the act
      of making such a Proposal is legal regardless of its content.
      It is legal to propose a Rule which conflicts with other Rules
      or with itself, which is paradoxical, or which cannot be
      applied.

========================================

Rule 405 (Mutable)
No Vacations for Officers

405.  No Vacations for Officers:

      No Officer may be 'On Hold' while holding an Office.  If a
      current Officer should place himself On Hold, he is assumed to
      have resigned without appointing a successor, and the Office
      should be re-filled in the normal manner.  This Rule takes
      precedence over Rule 386.

========================================

Rule 406 (Mutable)
Clerk of the Courts

406.  Clerk of the Courts, Part I: Definition of Office:

      There shall exist an Office "Clerk of the Courts", who shall
      have general responsibility over administering Calls for
      Judgement, as outlined in the Rules.  The active Clerk of the
      Court may never be selected as a Judge.

      As a salary for carrying out his duties, he will receive 5
      points at the end of every seven days he is in Office, counting
      from his assumption of the Office.

      The initial holder of this Office shall be the Player who
      submitted this Proposal.

========================================

Rule 407 (Mutable)
Invoking Judgement

407.  Clerk of the Courts, Part II: Invoking Judgement:

      If Players disagree about the legality of a Move or the
      interpretation or application of a Rule, then a Player may
      invoke Judgement by submitting a Statement for Judgement to the
      Clerk of the Courts.  Disagreement, for the purposes of this
      Rule, may be created by the insistence of any Player.  When
      Judgement is invoked, the Clerk of the Courts must, as soon as
      possible, select a Judge as described in the Rules.  The Clerk
      of the Courts must then distribute the Statement to be judged,
      along with the identity of the Judge, to all Players.

========================================

Rule 408 (Mutable)
Accepting Judge-ship

408.  Clerk of the Courts, Part III: Accepting Judge-ship:

      After the Clerk of the Courts has distributed the Statement to
      be judged and the identity of the Judge, the Judge has one week
      in which to deliver a legal Judgement.  If the Judge fails to
      deliver a Judgement within this time, e is penalized 10 points
      and a new Judge is selected.  A Judgement is delivered by
      submitting that Judgement to the Clerk of the Courts, who must
      then distribute that Judgement to all Players as soon as
      possible.

========================================

Rule 413 (Mutable)
Winning by Paradox

413.  Winning By Paradox:

      If the Rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or
      if the legality of some action cannot be determined with
      finality, or if some action appears equally legal and illegal,
      then a player may Call For Judgement on a Statement to that
      effect.  If the Statement is judged TRUE, then the same Judge
      who judged the Statement TRUE must declare the most recent
      passed Proposal X such that the Statement was not TRUE before
      the passage of Proposal X, or declare that there is no such
      Proposal.  (Until the Judge does this, the Judgment is not
      valid.)  If the Judgement of TRUE is not overruled, then the
      Player who called for Judgement is declared the Winner of the
      game.
      
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared that
      there is no such Proposal X, the game is ended, with no
      provisions for restarting it.
      
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared such
      a Proposal X, the following actions are taken:
         - all Players remain active,
         - all Proposals curently being Voted upon are removed from
           consideration for Voting,
         - the scores for all Players are set to 0 (zero),
         - the Rules and explicit game custom are reverted to the
           state they were in before Proposal X was passed,
         - a Benevolent Speaker for the next Game is chosen:
              -If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the
               Benevolent Speaker, and the old Benevolent Speaker
               becomes a Voter,
              -If there is more than one Winner, the Benevolent
               Speaker randomly selects one of the Winners, who
               becomes the new Benevolent Speaker, and the old
               Benevolent Speaker becomes a Voter,
         - and a new Game is begun.

========================================

Rule 415 (Mutable)
How To Submit a Proposal

415.  "How a Proposal is Submitted":

      A Proposal by a Voter shall be made by submitting it to the
      Mighty Speaker. As soon as possible after receiving the
      Proposal, the Mighty Speaker shall assign the Proposal a Number
      and distribute the Proposal along with its number to all
      Players.
      
      The Mighty Speaker may also make Proposals. The Mighty Speaker
      must process all pending Voter-submitted Proposals first, and
      may then Process Proposals of the Mighty Speaker, assigning
      these Proposals a number and distributing them in the same
      fashion as any other Proposal.

========================================

Rule 417 (Mutable)
The Nomic Archivist

417.  Establishment of the Office of Archivist:

      That there be established an office known as the Nomic
      Archivist, which shall be governed by the default Rules
      concerning official posts. The initial duties of the Nomic
      Archivist shall be to record the passage and failure of
      Proposals, to maintain a "historical record" (defined below)
      of the Ruleset, to maintain a list of Judgements and their case
      histories, and to maintain a list of game Winners in past games.
      The Archivist is free to comment on the historical records as
      they see fit, but such commentary must be clearly delimited
      from the historical material. Where the material being stored
      does not already admit a classification method, the Archivist
      is free to design one themselves.

      The "historical record" of the Ruleset maintained by the
      Archivist is one that includes all rules ever part of the nomic
      Ruleset, annotated with information as to their ultimate fate,
      whether Repealed or Amended etc. This record of the Ruleset has
      no legal force.

      The duties required of the Archivist may be changed with their
      consent and at the request of the Office's controlling body
      (whatsoever that may be). Initially, the controlling body of
      this Office shall be all Players, and any request to change the
      duties must therefore be supported by a majority of Players
      "speaking" to the request.  Naturally, default Rules for
      Offices may establish a different controlling body for this
      Office.
      
      The salary of the Archivist office shall be determined by its
      controlling body. Initially, its salary shall be 5 points and
      one coin of the office-holder's group per week.
      
      The initial office-holder for this post shall be Michael
      Norrish.

========================================

Rule 434 (Mutable)
Game May Be Won By CFJ

434.  Judgement Required to Win (and Timing of Win):

      If a Player believes that he has won the Game, he may submit a
      CFJ to that effect.  If it is returned with the Judgement TRUE
      (and that Judgement is not Appealed), then he has won the Game
      as of the delivery of that Judgement.  If the Judgement is TRUE,
      but is Appealed, but is sustained (and no Proposal to reverse
      the verdict is made), then he has won the Game as of the
      delivery of the Appeal verdict.  If such a verdict is sustained,
      challenged by Proposal, but the Proposal does not pass, he has
      won the Game as of the completion of the Vote on that Proposal.

      Judgement on a CFJ to win the Game may *not* be delivered until
      at least 72 hours after its official announcement, in order to
      give time for the Judge to accept input from the community.

      This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which specifies
      the exact moment at which a Game is won.

[Note: Implicit Game Custom dictates that, despite the title,
this rule does not *require* a CFJ in order to win the game.]

========================================

Rule 450 (Mutable)
Game Entities May Not Be Arbitrarily Changed

450.  Game Entities may not be Arbitrarily Changed:

      Any Entity which is created by the Nomic Rules, and which exists only
      within the context of the current Game of Nomic, such as Points,
      Votes, etc. may *not* be changed by any action other than those
      specified by the Rules.

========================================

Rule 451 (Mutable)
Determination of Judgement--Timing

451.  Timing of CFJ Results:

      When a CFJ makes a Statement about the current state of the
      Game, the result of that CFJ shall be TRUE if and only if the
      Judge feels that that Statement was correct at the time that the
      CFJ was *issued*. Any changes that have happened in the time
      between the issuing of the CFJ and its delivery must be figured
      in to find the correct current state.

========================================

Rule 452 (Mutable)
Prohibition of Electioneering by the Mighty Speaker

452.  Prohibition of Electioneering by the Mighty Speaker:

      The Speaker may not use eis knowledge of the current status of a
      vote on a Proposal in an attempt to influence the result of the
      Vote on that Proposal. Violations of this Rule shall be
      considered a Class C Crime.

========================================

Rule 454 (Mutable)
Declaring Proposals

454.  Clarity of Proposals:

      All Proposals must declare what effect that Proposal will have
      on the Rule Set. If said Proposal has a Title, this Declaration
      shall appear on the line immediately below that Title. In any
      case, the Declaration shall appear in parentheses. The
      Declarations shall be as follows:

         (Creates a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes a new
            Rule to come into existance.
         (Amends a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes an
            existing Rule to change wording or form.
         (Repeals a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes an
            existing Rule to cease to exist.
         (Transmutes a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes a
            Mutable Rule to become Immutable, or vice versa.
         (Other) shall be used if no other Declaration has been
            defined which describes the Proposal.

      Additional legislation may define additional legal Declarations
      or change the presentation of the Declaration, but this Rule
      shall take precedence in all other cases.

========================================

Rule 455 (Mutable)
Penalty for Improper or Lacking Declarations

455.  Further Declaration Rules:

      Any Player who submits a Proposal which does not include a
      Declaration, as described in other legislation, shall be guilty
      of a Class C Crime.  Any Player who submits a Proposal which
      includes a Declaration which has not been approved by
      legislation shall be guilty of a Class A Crime.

========================================

Rule 457 (Mutable)
Voting of the ex-Speaker

457.  Voting of the ex-Speaker:

      If a Player ceases to be the Speaker, and then becomes a Voter,
      that Player may not Vote on any Proposal whose Voting Period
      began while that Player was still the Speaker. This Rule takes
      precedence over any other Rule which indicates who may or may
      not Vote.

========================================

Rule 459 (Mutable)
The Nomic Week

459.  The Nomic Week

      The Nomic Week begins at midnight, GMT, each Monday. Any
      automatic change in the state of the Game which must occur
      weekly occurs at the beginning of the Nomic Week unless
      otherwise stated in the Rules. Any activity which must occur
      at least weekly must occur at least once each Nomic Week.

========================================

Rule 460 (Mutable)
Deregistration of Inactive Players

460.  Deregistration of Inactive Players

      A Player not On Hold who fails to post a message to the
      listserv, cast a Vote, or submit a Proposal or CFJ for 14
      consecutive calendar days is deemed to have left the Game and
      shall be removed from the list of Players. If the former Player
      re-enters the same Game, it shall be with the same score as when

               a Currency
            b) a player may not transfer more of a Currency than e
               currently has.

663.  General Rules For Injunctions

      There shall be an entity known as an Injunction, which may

      rules. An Injunction is a statement or series of statements
      specifying an action or actions which must take place. If a
      Judgement is is accompanied by an Injunction, that Injunction
      must be published with the Judgement. All players must abide by
      the Injunction beginning no later than 72 hours after its
      publication unless one of the following conditions then apply:
        - The Judgement which the Injunction accompanies is undergoing
          appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of the appeal
          process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but a proposal
          has been published which would overturn that decision if
          passed, and said proposal has not failed.
        - The validity of the Injunction itself is questioned by a
          pending CFJ.
        - A Judgement upholding the validity of the Injunction is
          undergoing appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of
          the appeal process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but
          a proposal has been published which would overturn that
          decision if passed, and said proposal has not failed.

      A Judgement may not be accompanied by an Injunction unless it is
      specifically permitted elsewhere in the rules. An Injunction
      must be completely consistent with all rules in effect at the
      time of issuance, and must be completely relevant to the matter
      addressed in the corresponding judgement.

      If any Player believes that an Injunction or any part of it does
      not meet the criteria for a valid Injunction, e may submit a CFJ
      to that effect. If the resulting Judgement supports the
      contention that the criteria are not met, the Injunction shall
      be considered illegal and shall have no legal force.

      This rule takes precedence over all rules governing Injunctions.

========================================

Rule 664 (Mutable)
Illegal Injuctions are Crimes

      Judgement supports the allegation, the Judge may include with
      the Judgement an Injunction specifying that the move is to be
      retracted, and any resulting adjustments to the published game
      state. The adjustments to the game state must have been
      unambiguously specified within the CFJ, and these adjustments
      must only undo actions which were a direct or indirect result of
      that Move.

Rule 669 (Mutable)
To Disobey an Injunction is Criminal

669.  Contempt of Court

      not respond to the Accusation within 72 hours, or within 72
      hours of the time that the Accused Player ceases to be On Hold,
      should e be On Hold when the Accusation is made, then the
      Accusing Player may call for Criminal Court. To do so, the
      Accusing Player shall notify the Clerk of the Courts of the
      intent to begin Criminal Court and shall send a copy of the
      Accusation to the Clerk of the Courts.
      A Judge is then selected exactly as in the case of a call for
      Judgement, and Players are notified exactly as in the case of a
      call for Judgement, except that the reasons for the Guilt of the
      Accused need not be distributed to all Players, only the
      Accusing Player, the Accused, and the Crime. When a Judge has
      been finally selected, the Clerk of the Courts shall notify the
      Accusing and the Accused Player of the identity of the Judge.

      As soon as the Accused Player, who shall be known as the
      Defendant, and the Accusing Player, who shall be known as the
      Prosecuter, have been notified of the identity of the Judge who
      has accepted the appointment, they shall both send all pertinent
      information regarding this Crime to the Judge. When each party
      has sent all information, they shall indicate so by explicitly
      stating such in their last message to the Judge. The Judge then
      has one week from the time at which both such messgaes have been
      recieved to return a Verdict, following all Rules exactly as if
      returning a Judgement in the case of a call for Judgement. The
      Judge shall not return a Verdict until at least 72 hours after
      the identity of the Judge is announced so that other interested
      Players can also send information to the Judge.

      A Verdict may be GUILTY, NOT GUILTY, or UNDECIDED. If the
      Verdict is GUILTY, then the Defendant shall suffer all the
      penalties relevant to the Class of Crime of which e was found
      GUILTY. If the Verdict is NOT GUILTY, then there shall be no
      effect. If the Verdict is UNDECIDED, then it shall be as if
      there had been no Criminal Court.  A Criminal Court may be
      Appealed exactly as a Call for Judgement may be Appealed,
      except that all information pertinent to the Court shall be
      given to all involved in the Appeal, and if the Appeal OVERRULES
      the Verdict, then the process of a Criminal Court shall occur
      again automatically.
      If other Rules designate another Appeals system for a Criminal
      Court, those Rules shall take precedence over this Rule.

      beginning of the Nomic Week, then each such active Player's
      score shall be increased to the Poverty Line by transferring
      points from the Point Reserve, provided there are sufficient
      points therein to cover all such transfers.

      A Player shall not receive points under this rule if e
      voluntarily transferred points to another Player during the
      previous Nomic Week.

Rule 724 (Mutable)
Winning the Game

724.  Requirements for Winning

      The Winner is the first Voter to achieve sufficiently many
      Points.  The minimum number of Points required for Player X to
      win is 10*N*(1+G/6), where N is the number of Players currently
      registered in the Game, and G is the number of Games which
      Player X has already won.  If more than one Voter achieves this

          Speaker and the old Speaker becomes a Voter.
        - If there is more than one Winner, the Voter with the highest Point 
          total becomes the new Speaker.  If more than one Voter is
          tied for the highest score, the old Speaker randomly selects
          one of them to become the new Speaker.  The old Speaker
          becomes a voter.
        - All Player's scores are reset to 0.
        - A new Game is begun.  All Rules and Proposals retain the
          status they had at the end of the old Game.

      Players with the most Marks. Only the current richest Player
      or Players may hold this title.

      The determination and announcement of assignment and revoking

      accurate means of determining this available to eim, and must
      make the announcement as soon as possible after becoming aware
      of a change in holder of the Title.

      However: To respect some Players' wish for privacy, and in
      view of the secret nature of Marks accounts, a prospective
      Marxist must first be asked if e wants the Title. If not, then
      instead of announcing, "Player x is granted the Patent Title of

      Any Player or Group X may perform an Act of Mischief directed

      are defined in other Rules; such definitions must include a 
      positive Price in Coins, or the form of Mischief is not
      permissible.  This Rule explicitly takes precedence over all
      other Rules which purport to determine which forms of Mischief
      are permissible.

      To cause an Act of Mischief,  X  sends to the Public Forum a
      message containing:
      - the Name of the object, Y;
      - the effect of the Act of Mischief;
      - the Number of the Rule which permits the form of Mischief;
      - indication of which Coins in X's account will be used as
      payment for the Act of Mischief.  Coins of Group Y, or the
      Group to which Player Y belongs, may not be used as payment.  

      The effect of the Act of Mischief is applied immediately upon 
      publication of the above message in the Forum.  An additional
      effect of this Act of Mischief is that
      - for each Coin of Group Z spent as payment above, two Points
      are removed from the Z Treasury;
      - the Coins used as payment above are removed from X's account

Rule 766 (Mutable)
Groups

766.  Amend Rule 714.

      A Group is initially formed by a set of Players which has
      registered with the Registrar to form a Group; other Players may
      join later.  Each Group has a Name, a Membership, a Vizier,
      an Ordinancekeepor, a Treasury, an Initial Set of Ordinances,
      and an associated form of Currency, called the <name> Coins,
      where <name> is the Name of the Group.

      1.  The Name may not be the Name of another Group.

      2.  The Membership is a set of Players;  these Players are
      Members of the Group, and all other Players are not.

      3.  Synchronously with the registration of a Group, two Offices
      are created known as the <name> Vizier, and the <name>
      Ordinancekeepor, where <name> is the Name of the Group.
      These Offices may never be empty, and the <name> Vizier and
      <name> Ordinancekeepor must both be a member of <name> Group.
      The <name> Vizier shall inform the Registrar whenever the
      Membership or the Ordinancekeepor of the <name> group changes.
      When the <name> Vizier changes, the new Vizier shall inform the
      Registrar of the change.
      The <name> Ordinancekeepor shall keep an accurate and current
      record of the Ordinances of the <name> Group.

      4.  The Treasury is a repository for Points and Currencies and
      has the same capabilities for holding, trading, and spending
      Points and Currencies as does a Player.

      5.  The Ordinances are a description of the operation of the
      Group.

      6.  The <name> Coins are a form of Currency which is created
      synchronously with the registration of the Group.  The <name>
      Group may create <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be
      placed in the <name> Treasury.  The <name> Group may destroy
      <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be removed from the
      <name> Treasury.

      Ordinances of a Group may determine how and when the Group
      casts its Votes; if the Ordinances are silent on this issue
      then the Group may not cast its Votes.  The Votes of the
      Group are cast when the Vizier sends a message to the Speaker
      to that effect during the Voting Period and this action is

      E must inform both the Banker and the Speaker when doing so.
      A Proposal which has Sanity imposed upon it is known as a Sane
      Proposal.  The Speaker shall, when e distributes a Sane
      Proposal, inform the Players that it is a Sane Proposal.

      No non-Voter Nomic entity may Vote on a Sane Proposal.  Each
      Voter shall have exactly one Vote on a Sane Proposal, and
      each Voter's Vote shall be counted exactly once on a Sane
      Proposal.

      This rule takes precedence over any rule allowing a non-Voter
      Nomic entity to Vote; over any rule which gives any Voter
      more or less than one Vote on a proposal; and over any
      rule which would cause any Voter's Vote to be counted more or

      least 200 words, containing all of the Prescribed Words,
      explaining the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
      for self-improvement, and posted in the Public Forum.  Within 48
      hours of the posting of this Formal Apology, the Squealer must
      either submit a Proposal that the Ninny's Apology be accepted,
      or submit a Proposal that the Ninny's Aplology be rejected,
      but not both.  No other Player may submit such a Proposal, and
      the Squealer may submit only one.  If a Proposal to accept the

      If the Speaker has abandoned eir post, another new, Temporary
      Speaker is selected according to the "Rules of Succession", or
      if no such rules are defined, the other Player not on hold with
      the highest Score becomes the temporary Speaker.  This does not
      force the Game to be over in this case, and Scores are not reset
      to 0. The Game continues until a Player Wins, at which time a
      new Game is begun and the Winner becomes the real Speaker. The
      Temporary Speaker shall make reasonable effort to obtain the
      former Speaker's materials: proposal queue, voting records, etc.
      but if this is not possible, then the Temporary Speaker shall
      request that these be resubmitted by the Players. If a Speaker
      is replaced in this manner, e has eir score set to minus 2N
      Points immediately, where N is the number of Points required for
      a Player to Win the Game.

      Abandonment is determined as follows: If any Player suspects
      that the Speaker has Abandoned, e sends a message to all Players
      calling on the Speaker to announce eir presence.  The Speaker

      not be penalized in points for the terminology or grammar used
      in those quotes.  This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule
      which specifies terminology or grammar.
      (*Was: 362*)

========================================

Rule 796 (Mutable)
The Distributor

796.  Make Use of the Distributor Optional

      There shall be an Office known as the Distributor. Whenever the
      Rules state that anything must be sent to all Players, they
      may instead be sent to the Distributor with some indication
      that they should be forwarded to all Players. The Distributor
      shall then send this message to all Players as soon as possible
      and in the order recieved. The first  Distributor shall be Wes.
      This Rule shall take precedence over all Rules which require a
      Player to send something to all Players.
      (*Was: 510*)

========================================

Rule 799 (Mutable)
Additional Declarations

799.  Amend Declarations

      There shall be additional legal Declarations which are as
      follows:

         (Award a Patent Title) shall be used if the Proposal does not
            Enact a Rule, but awards an existing Patent Title to a
            person.
         (Appeal by Proposal) shall be used for Proposals which seek
            to overturn a Judgement.
         (Run for Office) shall be used if a Proposal seeks to place a
            Player in Office, according to the Rules for Offices.
      (*Was: 650*)

========================================

Rul 803 (Mutable)
Quantum Marks--0.01

803.  Marks Granularity

      All Marks transfers between Game Entities must be in multiples
      of 0.01 Marks. Furthermore, whenever a quantity of Marks is
      changed, that quantity is immediately adjusted by rounding to
      the nearest .01 Mark.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which would permit a
      different granularity of Marks.

========================================

Rule 804 (Mutable)
Mandatory Stock Liquidation at End of Game

804.  Liquidation of Stock at End of Game

      At the end of a Game, all Stocks will be returned to the Bank to
      be Auctioned upon the start of a new Game.

      Each Player that owned Stock (as of the end of the old Game)
      will be compensated to the amount of one half of the Marks paid
      by that Player for eis Stocks.  The Marks for a given Stock
      shall be drawn from the account of the Player to which the Stock
      corresponds.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules governing ownership
      of Stocks.

========================================

Rule 805 (Mutable)
Definition of "As Soon As Possible"

805.  Defined Partial Ordering of Actions

      Whenever a Player is required to perform a certain action "as
      soon as possible", e is required to perform this action before
      performing any other actions which have a less strictly defined
      time requirement.  However, email correspondence of a purely
      discussionary nature is excluded from the ordering requirement,
      and may be conducted at any time.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which stipulate a
      less stringent ordering requirement for the performance of these
      actions.

========================================

Rule 806 (Mutable)
Speaker Performs Duties of Vacant Offices

806.  Provide For Vacant Offices

      While an Office is vacant, and until it is filled as provided in
      other rules, the Speaker shall fulfill the duties of that
      Office.  The Speaker may delegate those duties to a willing
      Player if e desires.

      This Rule applies to Offices in general, and defers to the Rules
      for specific Offices.

========================================

Rule 807 (Mutable)
Non-Rule-Change Proposals

807.  Non-Rule-Change Proposals

      Proposals may be made which do not contain Rule Changes.  The
      permissible forms of Non-Rule-Change Proposals (or NRC
      Proposals), and the Declarations needed to propose them, shall
      be defined in other legislation.

      NRC Proposals are Voted upon and treated exactly like other
      Proposals, and shall be Numbered exactly like other Proposals.
      Upon the Adoption of a NRC Proposal, it shall take effect with
      results as described in the Rule or Rules that define the form
      of the Proposal in question.

========================================

Rule 809 (Mutable)
The Ambassador

809.  The Ambassador:  Conduct of Foreign Policy

      There shall be an Office known as the Ambassador.  The
      Ambassador shall have the sole power to conduct Foreign
      Policy.  Foreign Policy is defined as interacting with
      other Nomic Games in an official capacity, and/or 
      participating on behalf of the Players of this Nomic
      Game in any Central Nomic Game to be created.

      The Ambassador shall report to the Public Forum once a
      Nomic Week on any new Foreign Policy developements of
      that Nomic Week or the previous one.  In any Nomic Week
      in which Foreign Policy activity occurs, the Ambassador
      shall receive a salary of two (2) Points.

      Upon any change in the position of Speaker, the Office
      of Ambassador shall devolve to the new Speaker.  Except
      for this provision, the Office is chosen as described
      in other Rules.

      Proposals may be submitted directing the Ambassador on
      how to conduct a single piece of Foreign Policy business.
      Such Proposals are automatically Sane, and if passed are
      binding upon the Ambassador.  If the Ambassador acts
      contrary to such a Proposal, e may be charged with a 
      Class C Crime.  Such Proposals are submitted with the
      the following legal Declaration:
         (Foreign Policy Directive)

========================================

Rule 815 (Mutable)
Send Stuff Directly to Officers

815.  Proper Distribution

      Let all messages, information, requests, statements, CFJs,
      answers, etc. that Rules indicate are to be sent or delivered to
      a specific Office or Officer be sent directly to them.  

      Instances where a Player breaks this rule are to be ignored by
      said Office or Officer until e receives the message thru means
      not broadcast to the Public Forum.  Further, it shall be
      considered a Class A crime to send such a message to the Public
      Forum without first sending it to the proper Office or Officer.

      It shall be a Class A crime for an Office/r to respond to such a
      message if it was not sent in the proper manner.

========================================

Rule 816 (Mutable)
Title of Originator

816.  Title of Originator

      Let there be a Patent Title known as Originator.  This Patent
      Title shall be given to Chuck.  No other person shall hold
      this Patent Title at any time.

------------------------------------------
PROPOSAL 829 (Waggie)
Reward for Good Proposals
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 544 to read as follows:

When the Voting Period for a Proposal is over, the Proposer
recieves N  Points, where  N  is calculated as follows.  Let
F  be the number of Votes cast FOR the Proposal, and let  A
be the number of votes cast AGAINST the Proposal.  Then  N
is the greater of  F-A  and  -10  if  F-A  is negative, and
N is the lesser of  F-A and  10  if  F-A  is not negative.
(*Was: 544*)
-------------------------------------------
PROPOSAL 830 (Waggie)
Bodyguards
(Creates a Rule)

Any Player (A) may arrange with another Player (B) for B to
act as A's Bodyguard.  The amount of compensation and duration
of the arrangement may be anything mutually agreable to A and B.
The arrangement takes effect when both A and B have agreed to it
in the Public Forum, and the agreed-upon compensation has been
made.  A Player may have any number of Bodyguards.  A Player may
only act as the Bodyguard for one Player at a time.  It is the
responsibility of the Registrar to keep a record of these Bodyguard
arrangements.  While such an arrangement is in effect, no Coin of the
Group to which B belonged at the time the arrangement was made may
be used as payment for an Act of Mischief directed at A.  This Rule
takes precedence over other Rules which purport to determine when
an Act of Mischief is permissible, and which types of Coin may be
used as Payment for an Act of Mischief.
----------------------------------------
PROPOSAL 831 (Waggie)
Limit on Number of Proposals
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 791 to read as follows:

Each Player has the right to submit one Proposal in each Nomic
Week, but it is a priviledge to be allowed to submit more than
one Proposal in each Nomic Week.  Players may freely trade their
right to submit a Proposal in any given Nomic Week for any form
of compensation which they find acceptable.  Such a trade is
effected by a message posted in the Public Forum.

The Vizier of each Group is priviledged to submit up to three
Proposals in each Nomic Week.

[The Speaker does not oppose this proposal.  It is not contested.]
[Speaker's comment:  I am not forbidden or instructed to distribute
only those proposals that are submitted by those Players that follow
this Rule.  ie: Ian can submit 20 proposals and ignore both rights
and priviledges that this Proposal tries to bring about.] 
====================
Proposal 832 (Garth)

The Name of the Game
(Creates a Rule)

This Nomic Game shall be known by the name "phoenix".

[I've proto-proposed this twice and haven't heard any objections,
and some approval, so here it is.]
[Speaker's comment:  I don't like it, I also didn't see reason to
voice my opinion tho.]
===================
Proposal 833 (Garth)

Reward Successful Proposals
(Amends a Rule)

The last sentence of Rule 544 is hereby removed.

The following sentence is appended to Rule 544:

"However, only the Votes of Voters shall be counted for this
determination."

[This patches the infamous loophole in Rule 544.  In addition, it
ensures that Voters will not be penalized (or rewarded) for the
Votes of Groups and the Vototron.]
[Speaker's comment:  Timing is everything. :)  ]
=======================
Proposal 834-837 (Garth)

Overhaul of the Criminal Justice System
(Other)

Rules 600, 605, and 710 are hereby Repealed.

Rule 355 is amended in the following ways:

The following text is added after the first sentence:  "Similarly, if a
Player believes that any Player has commited a Crime, e may invoke 
Judgement on a Statement to that effect.  The term "Criminal Court" is
defined as a Judge of either of the above two types of Statements."

The second to last sentence has the following text added after the word
"Rule":  " or committing the Crime, as applicable."

The last sentence has the following text added after the word "Rule":
" or committing the Crime, as applicable." 

[Streamlines the Criminal Justice system.  Resolves Crimes via a mechanism
already in the Rules, that of Accusation.  Further, all the useful Rules that
happen to refer to a Criminal Court are retained.]

[Speaker's comment:  As this was submitted in a block and was not
seperated in any fashion, I shall be accepting only those votes for
this mess that are all FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN.  Any other combination
will be considered to be either AGAINST or ABSTAIN, depending on
something yet to be decided. *sigh*  As there is a CFJ on this issue
currently pending one would hope that it would not be tried again.]

Status: OR

*CFJ 114 (Chuck)

*Submitted:  Fri Feb  4 11:01:35 1994

*The Judge shall be:  Waggie, who is directed to respond
as directed by the Ruleset.

*Statement to be Judged:
In distributing the proposal entitled "Eliminates the Office of
Distributor,"  the Speaker at that time, Jeffrey S., violated
Rule 109.

*Decision of Judge:  True, and additional ruling

*Argument for CFJ:
Argument: This proposal (numbered "817" by Jeffrey S.) contains not
one, but six proposed Rule Changes.  By Rule 109, *each* proposed
Rule Change must receive its own number.  Thus, the proposed Rule
Changes in the proposal should receive the numbers 817, 818, 819,
820, 821, and 822.

[Let me suggest that the proper way to fix this is to amend 594 so
that each Proposal may contain only one Rule Change.]

[Let me also note that if this is judged TRUE, the Judge *must*
issue a Formal Apology Injunction, as per Rule 781.]

Relevant proposal and Rules:

>Proposal 817 (Garth)

>Eliminates the Office of Distributor

>Rules 510, 511, 512, 513, and 514 are hereby repealed.

>==========================

Rule 109 (Immutable)
Rule Numbers

109.

      The Speaker shall give each proposed Rule Change a Number for
      reference.  The numbers shall begin with 301, and each Rule
      Change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next
      successive integer, whether or not the Proposal is adopted.
        If a Rule is Repealed and Reenacted, it receives the Number of
      the Proposal to Reenact it.  If a Rule is Amended or Transmuted,
      it receives the Number of the Proposal to Amend or Transmute it.

===========
Rule 105 (Immutable)
What Is a Rule Change?

105.

      A Rule Change is any of the following:  (1) the enactment,
      repeal, or amendment of a mutable Rule; or (2) the transmutation
      of an immutable Rule into a mutable Rule or vice versa.
        (Note:  This definition implies that, at least initially, all
      new Rules are Mutable; Immutable Rules, as long as they are
      Immutable, may not be Amended or Repealed; Mutable Rules, as long
      as they are Mutable, may be Amended or Repealed; any Rule of any
      status may be Transmuted; no Rule is absolutely immune to change.)

==========
Rule 594 (Mutable)
Proposals and Rule Changes

594.  Proposals and Rule Changes

      A Proposal may contain one or more Rule Changes. If the Proposal
      is Adopted, then the Rule Change(s) contained within that
      Proposal shall take effect. All Proposals are Voted upon and
      treated exactly like Rule Changes, and shall be Numbered exactly
      like Rule Changes. This Rule takes precedence over all other
      Rules.

      At the moment that Rule 105 is Transmuted, this Rule shall be
      Amended to read:

      A Proposal may contain one or more Rule Changes. If the Proposal
      is Adopted, then the Rule Change(s) contained within that
      Proposal shall take effect. No Proposal may Enact or Amend more
      than one Rule.

*Time decision received:  [Sun Feb 13 20:58:56 1994]
This decision was received by the CotC within 72 hours of CFJ posting.

*Reasoning used by Judge:
This was a tricky one.  First of all, I percieve a conflict between
594 and 109.
    
Rule 109 says in part that  
      The Speaker shall give each proposed Rule Change a Number for
      reference.  The numbers shall begin with 301, and each Rule
      Change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next
      successive integer, whether or not the Proposal is adopted.

Rule 594 says in part that
                                   All Proposals are Voted upon and
      treated exactly like Rule Changes, and shall be Numbered exactly
      like Rule Changes. This Rule takes precedence over all other
      Rules.

If Rule 594 were effective, then it would be impossible to number the
Rule Changes with consecutive integers, since each Proposal must also
be numbered just as the Rule Changes are.  Proposals and Rule Changes
can not, under this interpretation, be synonymous, since 594 states
that "A Proposal may contain one or more Rule Changes.".  Thus, an
example of the type of numbering required of the Speaker if 594 is
effective is:
=============
Proposal 999 (Bif)
Rule Changes 1000, 1001, and 1002.
(Other)
Fiddle with the Rules a Bit

Repeal Rule 888.  Repeal Rule 889. Amend Rule 890 to read ....
=============
Proposal 1003 (Zoomer)
Rule Change 1004.
(Repeals a Rule)
Eliminate a Contradiction

Repeal Rule 594.
=============
This conflicts with 109 because Rule Changes in consecutive Proposals
can not recieve consecutive integer numbers.  Now, since the Mutable 594
conflicts with the Immutable 109, by Rule 111 (Conflicts between Immutables
and Mutables) Rule 594 is "entirely void".  Rule 594 states in part that
"A Proposal may contain one or more Rule Changes.".  This sentence occurs
nowhere else in the RuleSet.  Now Rule 116 (Legal by Omission) states that
   Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted and
   unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules, which is
   permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly or implicitly
   permits it.
It is my interpretation that Rule 109 (Numbering of Proposals) implicitly
assumes that there is at most one Rule Change per Proposal, because of
the last two sentences concerning the numbering convention for Rules. 
Since 594 is entirely void, this interpretation is in effect.  Therefore,
the Proposal submitted by Garth was not submitted in the proper way, and
should not be Voted on.  Rule 109 also forbids the Speaker from numbering
and distributing improperly submitted Proposed Rule Changes.  Thus, Chuck's
interpretation that the six Rule Changes of Garth's Proposal should recieve
six consecutive numbers is incorrect.  In fact, Garth's Proposal was not
properly submitted, and his Rule Changes should not have been numbered at
all.  The fact that Jeffrey S. did so is a direct violation of Rule 109.
Thus, I come to the decision that Chuck's allegation be Judged TRUE.

[Note:  Rule 415 (Submissions of Proposals) is also problematic, but I
don't want to deal with that right now.]

*Additional decision of the Judge:
As per Rule 781 (Formal Apologies) I hereby issue the following
Injunction:

Let it be required that Jeffrey S., in pennance for his breach of Rule
109, submit a Formal Apology containing the Prescribed Words:
{starship, captain, smooching, alien, triskelion, tinfoil, bikini, thrall,
babe's, quatloos}.

I will have to use a different format for the reporting of 
results in regards to the latest set of Proposals due to
the many vototron contributions. 

More than one Player changed eis Vote and Vototron contribution
during this period.  Combined with a change in Speakers I
beleive that it is possible for some of the Votes to have
been recorded incorrectly.  If you feel that this has happened
to your vote please send me a message immediately.

PROPOSAL 818  (Waggie)
Scam School 202
(Creates a Rule)

Let there be a type of Nomic Entity called a Walrus.
Walruses are not a form of Currency; they may be owned by
Players or Groups, but they may not be bought, sold, traded,
or owed. Walruses may be created or destroyed only in accordance
with the Rules.  Each Walrus is either Happy or Sad, but not
both; a Happy Walrus nay never become a Sad Walrus, and a Sad
Walrus may never become a Happy Walrus.  It is the duty of the
Registrar to keep a record of the number of Happy and/or Sad
Walruses owned by each Player or Group.

Immediately upon the passage of this Proposal the following shall
take place:
 -for each Voter who Voted FOR both this Proposal and Proposal
  819, a Happy Walrus will be created belonging to that Voter;
 -for each Voter who contributed at least 2 Points to each of the
  FOR Caches of the Vototron for both this Proposal and Proposal
  819, one Happy Walrus will be created belonging to that Voter;
 -for each Member of PROSIRUP, one Happy Walrus will be created
  belonging to that Player;
 -three Happy Walruses will be created belonging to Waggie;
 -three Happy Walruses will be created belonging to the Abelian
  Group;
 -for each Voter who did not Vote on either this Proposal or
  Proposal 819 a Sad Walrus will be created belonging to that
  Voter;
 -for each Voter who Voted AGAINST or ABSTAIN on either this
  Proposal or Proposal 819 three Sad Walruses will be created
  belonging to that Voter;
 -for each Voter who contributed at least 0.1 Point to either of
  the AGAINST Caches of the Vototron for this Proposal and Proposal
  819, one Sad Walrus will be created and given to that Voter for
  each tenth of a Point spent thusly;
 -for each Group which Voted on either this Proposal or Proposal
  819, one Walrus will be created and given to that Group for
  each Vote which was cast; the Walrus will be Happy if the Vote
  was FOR, and the Walrus will be Sad if the Vote was AGAINST
  or ABSTAIN.

At any time after the creation of at least one Walrus, if there
cease to be any Walruses in existence then this Rule repeals
itself and is removed from the RuleSet.

[And they said it couldn't be done!  <Mwah-hah-hah-heh-heh-heh!>
Rule 783 applies only to Points and Currencies, not Walruses.]

Proposal PASSES

[Speaker's comments:  The Walruses have already died.  This proposal
was passed at the end of the voting period along with former Rule 818.
As there are no Walruses currently, and there was not enuf time for
the Registrar to record who had what, the Clerk is happily accepting
CFJs claiming the Registrar was derelict.  :)  Further issues are
bound to result at a quantum level because of the above proposals,
stay tuned.]

PROPOSAL 820  (KoJen)
Scam School 303
(Creates a Rule)

Let there be a type of Nomic Entity called a Bunny.
Bunnies are not a form of Currency; they may be owned by
Players or Groups, but they may not be bought, sold, traded,
or owed. Bunnies may be created or destroyed only in accordance
with the Rules.  Each Bunny is either Glad or Mad, but not
both; a Glad Bunny may never become a Mad Bunny, and a Mad
Bunny may never become a Glad Bunny.  It is the duty of the
Registrar to keep a record of the number of Glad and/or Mad
Bunnies owned by each Player or Group.

Immediately upon the passage of this Proposal the following shall
take place:
 -for each Voter who Voted FOR both this Proposal and Proposal
  821, a Glad Bunny will be created belonging to that Voter;
 -for each Voter who contributed at least 2 Points to each of the
  FOR Caches of the Vototron for both this Proposal and Proposal
  821, one Glad Bunny will be created belonging to that Voter;
 -six Glad Bunnies will be created belonging to KoJen;
 -three Glad Bunnies will be created belonging to the PROSIRUP
  Group;
 -for each Voter who did not Vote on either this Proposal or
  Proposal 821 a Mad Bunny will be created belonging to that
  Voter;
 -for each Voter who Voted AGAINST or ABSTAIN on either this
  Proposal or Proposal 821 three Mad Bunnies will be created
  belonging to that Voter;
 -for each Voter who contributed at least 0.1 Point to either of
  the AGAINST Caches of the Vototron for this Proposal and Proposal
  821, one Mad Bunny will be created and given to that Voter for
  each tenth of a Point spent thusly;
 -for each Group which Voted on either this Proposal or Proposal
  821, one Bunny will be created and given to that Group for
  each Vote which was cast; the Bunny will be Glad if the Vote
  was FOR, and the Bunny will be Mad if the Vote was AGAINST
  or ABSTAIN.

At any time after the creation of at least one Bunny, if there
cease to be any Bunnies in existence then this Rule repeals
itself and is removed from the RuleSet.

------------------------------------------------------------------
PROPOSAL 822 (KoJen)
Stop the Insanity
(Creates a Rule)

Proposals whose obvious and direct intent is to coerce a Player into
voting against eir conscience are disallowed. For the purpose of Rule
106 or its successors, such a proposal is considered not to be
"proposed in the proper way".

This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which would otherwise
allow such a shameful Proposal to be voted on.

[As usual, the CFJ shall be the means for determining if this Rule
applies in a given situation.]

I would like to submit an humble apology for my grevious error.
I am apoplectic about being held in /thrall/ by the visage of my
roommate [who seems somewhat /alien/ to me] who was last viewed
/smooching/ with a pornographic magazine.

I could blame his behaviour on the new 'conquest over the /alien/'
commputer game, to which he seems stuck like /tinfoil/ on a burnt
turkey.  Oh possibly like a Trekkie to /Captain/ Kirk.  And to
those who were sorry to see him destroy the many /starship/s, I
can only say that it is much better than being eaten by /Quatloos/.

/Triskelion/s aside, I shall concentrate on the Game at hand and
not let my eyes be turned by any /babe's/ /bikini/.

Humbly,  Speaker/Clerk Jeffrey S.

*CFJ 113 (Garth)

*Submitted:  Wed, 26 Jan 94 20:17:55 -0800

*The first Judge appointed: Dave Nicol, who respond per Rule 647.
*The Judge shall be:  Vlad

*Statement to be Judged:  Rule 648 does not conflict with Rule 106.

*Argument for CFJ:
Reasoning:  Rule 106 states that "All Rule Changes proposed *in the
proper way* shall be voted on."  (emphasis mine)  Rule 648 permits
Players to Withdraw Proposals.  I argue that Rule 648 thus implies
that a Withdrawn Proposal ceases to be considered to have been
Proposed properly.
Even if the previous line of reasoning is wrong, there is another
possibility.  Rule 648 states that a Withdrawn Proposal shall not
be Adopted under any circumstance.  The term 'Adopt' has thus been
qualified beyond the implicit definition in Rule 106.  Thus, under
this line of reasoning, a Withdrawn Proposal *would* be voted upon
as provided in Rule 106, but it would not be Adopted, as one of the
conditions for Adoption (namely, receiving "the required number of
votes" and not having been Withdrawn) has not been met.  The text
of Rules 106 and 648 has been appended for the Judge's convenience.

106.

      All Rule Changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on.
      They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required
      number of votes and Quorum is achieved.

648.  Withdrawing Proposals

      At any time not less than 24 hours before the end of a Voting
      Period for a given Proposal, the originator of that Proposal
      (and no other Player) may Withdraw that Proposal. A Withdrawn
      Proposal shall not be Adopted under any circumstances, and no
      Points will be gained or lost due to that Proposal, except that
      the Player who Withdrew that Proposal shall lose 3 Points. In
      addition, the Proposal will not count towards any limits on the
      number of Proposals the Player may submit.
      This Rule takes precedence over all other Rules which would
      Adopt a Proposal, which would change a Player's score due to a
      Proposal, or which limit the number of Proposals a Player may
      submit.

Here are some new Proposals for your consideration & Votes:

Speaker Jeffrey S.
--------
--------
Proposal 838 (Jeffrey S.)

Think for Yourself
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 762 to read:
Upon any such occassions that a Player ceases to be a member of a
group, said Players shall receive that part of a group's treasury 
which is defined and allowed by the ordinances of said group.

If a group ceases to exist and the disbursment of the group's
treasury is unspecified the treasury shall belong to the Bank.
Once a group's treasury has been tranfered to the Bank no Nomic
Entity may excercise claim on the contents of said treasury.

[This encorages Players to have a group's ordinances be helpful
and comprehensive rather than cluttering up the Ruleset with
Rules that don't belog there.  If a group cannot reach concensus
and deal with this issue amongst its members I do not think that
the Ruleset should be used to settle its problems.]

--------
--------
Proposal 839 (Jeffrey S.)

Office of the Assistant
(Makes a Rule)

Let there be an Office of the Assistant.  Said Office shall be
responsible for collecting those messages which are official in
nature from the Speaker ad Officers.  Messages are to be edited
into a single digest post.

The Assistant shall maintain previous digests and make them 
available upon request to any entity, including those Players on 
Hold.  This Rule shall take precidence over all other Rules 
regarding commuication with Players on Hold.

--------
--------
PROPOSAL 840 (KoJen)
The Scamster
(Creates a Rule)

Let there be a Patent Title known as the "Scamster". This is awarded
to a Player who has shown great enthusiasm, persistence, or skill in
the perpretating of Scams. This title is awarded by Proposal and once
awarded is permanent.

A Scamster must pay a one-time fee of 1 Point to the Point Reserve
upon receiving the Title. This fee is not optional, and the Patent
Title may not be declined.

[Justification: Although I do not condone the perpretation of Scams,
as I feel they are a distraction from more pressing issues, such
people deserve recognition. The 1 Point fee is a token amount, but
nonetheless serves as a reminder that Scamster is *not* an honor.]

--------
--------
PROPOSAL 841 (KoJen)
The First Scamster
(Awards a Patent Title)

In recognition of several amusing Scams, the patent title of Scamster
is hereby awarded to Dave Wagner.

[Justification: Waggie deserves it more than any other current Player.]

--------
--------
PROPOSAL 842 (KoJen)
The Most Titled Player
(creates a Rule)

Let there be a Patent Title known as "Most Titled". This Title is to
be given to the Player who has the largest number of Patent
Titles. The Registrar is charged with keeping track of this and
announcing when the Most Titled Player changes.

*CFJ 116 (Alice)

*Submitted:  Wed Feb 16 13:18:39 1994

*The Judge shall be:  Garth

*Statement to be Judged:
The Clerk of Courts, Jeffrey, moved illegally by accepting a CFJ which is 
invalid (violation of Rule 662).  

*Reasoning for CFJ:
Despite the fact that CFJ 111 was submitted to Public Forum and should
not have even been considered in the first place (Rule 407), the statement
"The Banker erred in announcing..." does NOT *clearly* *allege* that the 
given move was *illegal*, in fact, it merely implies 
that Banker KoJen made a mistake, which may or may not have been illegal.  The 
invocation of Judgement must satisfy at least one of the conditions declared 
in Rule 662, and by Rule 407, the invocation consists of the  Statement 
submitted, and not of any arguements that may accompany it.  When an error is 
made by any entity, that does NOT clearly imply that it is illegal.  Thusly, 
since CFJ 111 does not meet any of the requirements as outlined in Rule 662, 
it is deemed invalid.

  206.

        Each Voter has exactly one Vote.  The Speaker may not Vote.

Jeffrey sent his voting choices to me on 2/7/94 while I was Speaker and
he was a Voter. However, this did not become a Vote until the instant before
the end of the Voting period. Clearly this is so because Game Custom allows a
Voter to submit multiple conflicting voting choices during a Voting period, and
only the last one is considered valid. Since "Game Entities May not be
Arbitrarily Changed" (Rule 450), it is clear that these voting choices are not
Votes until the end of the Voting period, when there is no longer any
possibility of changing them. Since Jeffrey became Speaker on 2/8/94
and the Vote became effective on 2/11/94, it is clear that he violated
Rule 206.

It should be noted that this situation is the opposite of that covered by Rule
457: Voting of the ex-Speaker. That Rule covers the Voting rights of a Speaker
who becomes a Voter, whereas in this opposite situation the issue is the Voting
rights of a Voter who becomes a Speaker. 

  Rule 457 (Mutable)
  Voting of the ex-Speaker

  457.  Voting of the ex-Speaker:

        If a Player ceases to be the Speaker, and then becomes a Voter,
        that Player may not Vote on any Proposal whose Voting Period
        began while that Player was still the Speaker. This Rule takes
        precedence over any other Rule which indicates who may or may
        not Vote.

Although there is no Rule specifically addressing the current situation, it is
clearly and unmistakingly apparent from considering the totality of the Rule
Set and well-established Game Custom that Jeffrey's action was illegal.

*Additional stuff attached to Rational for CFJ:
Therefore, I am recommending that the judge accompany eir decision of TRUE with
an injunction which includes the following:

* Adjustment of the Rule Set to reflect the consequent non-passage of Prop 818.

* Adjustment of Marks accounts to undo the effects of any Walruses.

* Adjustment of Points accounts to undo the effects of any Walruses.

* Adjustment of Jeffrey's Points account to remove the Point he received from
Voting. 

* Adjustment of Waggie's Points account to reflect the non-passage of Prop 818.

* Adding an annotation to Rule 206 stating that the prohibition against the
Speaker's voting includes the situation where e becomes Speaker while a
Proposal's Voting period is ongoing, because a Vote is not official until the
moment before the end of the Voting period.

* A demand for an apology by Jeffrey containing 10 words of the Judges choice,
per Rule 781.

Clerk Jeffrey S.

*CFJ 118 (Stella?)

*Submitted for Judgement:  Fri Feb 18 04:02:33 1994

*Judge shall be:  Vlad

*Statement to be Judged:
When a Player leaves the Game, he/she obviously is no longer a Player.
The phrase "same Player later joins the Game again" (Rule 518) is
therefore a logical impossibility.

*Rational given for CFJ:
Consequently, even if the same *person* rejoins the Game, he/she still
has the right on a starting capital of three Marks.

Rule 518 for reference:
518.  Starting Marks

      Upon the passage of this Rule, 3 Marks shall be created for
      every Player in the Game, and given to those Players. If a new
      Player joins the Game, 3 Marks are created and given to that
      Player. If a Player leaves the Game, whatever Marks are in their
      possession are destroyed. If that same Player later joins the
      Game again, they shall not recieve any Marks.

The Distributor has a weak hope that he finally found the bug in his
Automatic Distributing System. If you get this, please answer.

(For those who want to know, I discovered by some freak coincidence
while trying to set up elm in my X menu that it refused to start this way.
This was due to me using the variable $EDITOR as my default elm editor,
whereas this was not defined when elm was started through xon.
I realized this might be the reason that my filter did not work,
and have now created instead a small EDITOR shell script. With some luck
this will solve both problems.)

Greetings,
Distributor Oerjan.
