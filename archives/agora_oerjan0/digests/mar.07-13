Sadly, I received only four entries into my Koan Contest (Koan Kontest?),
and those written only by two different players.  But maybe it's
just as well, as all four of them were quite good and judging
was difficult.  (If more players wish to submit Koans I will
continue to collect them, but of course I am no longer offering
a prize.)

As I promised, first prize is 0.5 Marks and second prize is 0.2 Marks.
In recognition of the other two good Koans I received, each of those
receives an "Honorable Mention" and 0.1 Marks.  (The "Honorable Mentions"
are listed in the order received by me.)  (Side note: Yes, I am American.
If you want to run your own contest, you can give out "Honourable Mentions"
;)


FIRST PRIZE (Stella?)

   A Nomic Student asked a Nomic Master, `Can I become enlightened by
playing Nomic?'
   The Master answered: `E who strives to make the Ideal Ruleset will
be enlightened.'
   Unsatisfied, the Student asked: `How many Rules does the Ideal
Ruleset have?'
   `One more', was the answer. But the Student was not enlightened.

   The next day, the Student submitted his very first Proposal and it
was adopted.
   At that moment, the Student was enlightened.

[Chuck's comment: perhaps not nearly as humorous as the others, but
it expresses one of those Great Nomic Truths.]


SECOND PRIZE (Garth)

A Nomic Student came to a Nomic Master and asked, "What is the
inner meaning of Nomic?"  The Master replied, "What is the
color of the Vototron?"  The Student was not enlightened.

The next day, the Student returned and asked, "Master, I do
not understand.  How can the Vototron have a color?"  The
Master replied, "It has the same color as a Point." The Student
was enlightened.

[Chuck's comment:  Very Zen.  The Student here may be enlightened, but
I'm not!  Therefore it must be good. ;) ]


HONORABLE MENTION (Garth)

A Nomic Student came to an ancient Nomic Master known as PROSIRUP
and asked, "Why do we play Nomic incessantly when we have families
and jobs?"  The Master replied, "What is the meaning of Rule 123?"
The Student was not enlightened.

The next day, the Master Proposed that Rule 123 be Transmuted.
In deference to eis wisdom, the Proposal was Adopted, though
there was no such Rule.  The Student watched as the CFJ's poured
in.  "Why do we play this game?!" he exclaimed in amazement.
The Master replied, "What is the meaning of Rule 123?"

The Student was enlightened.


HONORABLE MENTION (Stella?)

   A Nomic Student asked a Nomic Master: `Why does nobody ever submit
Paradox CFJ's?'
   In response, the Master disappeared. The Student was not enlightened.
   The next day, a Nomic Player submitted a Paradox CFJ. It was judged
TRUE.
   The Nomic Player, the Judge, the Speaker, all Voters disappeared,
as well as the rest of the Universe.
   At that moment, the Student was enlightened.

THE CURRENT RULESET
Part 1 of 5 

Rules are listed as follows, where NNN represents the Rule number:

========================================

Rule NNN (Immutable or Mutable)
My Own Unofficial Title

NNN.  Semi-Official Rule Title, If There Is One

      Text of Rule

[Note:  I have annotated some Rules to clarify their interpretation.
However, these annotations have no legal force in and of themselves.]

========================================



========================================

Rule 101 (Immutable)
Obey the Rules

101.

      All Players must always abide by all the Rules then in effect,
      in the form in which they are then in effect.  The Rules in the
      Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the first game.
      The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (Immutable) and
      201-219 (Mutable).

========================================

Rule 102 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Rules

102.

      Initially Rules in the 100's are Immutable and Rules in the
      200's are Mutable.  Rules subsequently Enacted or Transmuted
      (that is, changed from Immutable to Mutable or vice versa) may
      be Immutable or Mutable regardless of their Numbers, and Rules
      in the Initial Set may be Transmuted regardless of their Numbers.

========================================

Rule 103 (Immutable)
The Speaker and Voters

103.

      At any time, each Player shall be either a Voter or the Speaker;
      no Player may simultaneously be a Voter and a Speaker. At any
      time, there shall be exactly one Speaker. The term "Player" in
      the Rules shall specifically include both the Voters and the
      Speaker.

========================================

Rule 104 (Immutable)
First Speaker

104.

      The Speaker for the first game shall be Michael Norrish.

========================================

Rule 105 (Immutable)
What Is a Rule Change?

105.

      A Rule Change is any of the following:  (1) the enactment,
      repeal, or amendment of a mutable Rule; or (2) the transmutation
      of an immutable Rule into a mutable Rule or vice versa.
        (Note:  This definition implies that, at least initially, all
      new Rules are Mutable; Immutable Rules, as long as they are
      Immutable, may not be Amended or Repealed; Mutable Rules, as long
      as they are Mutable, may be Amended or Repealed; any Rule of any
      status may be Transmuted; no Rule is absolutely immune to change.)

========================================

Rule 106 (Immutable)
Adopting Proposed Rule Changes

106.

      All Rule Changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on.
      They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required
      number of votes and Quorum is achieved.

========================================

Rule 107 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Must Be Written Down

107.

      Any proposed Rule Change must be written down (or otherwise
      communicated in print media) before it is voted on. If adopted,
      it must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.

========================================

Rule 108 (Immutable)
When May Rule Changes Take Effect?

108.

      No Rule Change may take effect earlier than the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording
      explicitly states otherwise.  No rule change may have retroactive
      application.

========================================

Rule 109 (Immutable)
Rule Numbers

109.

      The Speaker shall give each proposed Rule Change a Number for
      reference.  The numbers shall begin with 301, and each Rule
      Change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next
      successive integer, whether or not the Proposal is adopted.
        If a Rule is Repealed and Reenacted, it receives the Number of
      the Proposal to Reenact it.  If a Rule is Amended or Transmuted,
      it receives the Number of the Proposal to Amend or Transmute it.
 
========================================

Rule 110 (Immutable)
Transmutation of Rules

110.

      Rule Changes that Transmute Immutable Rules into Mutable Rules
      may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among Votes
      legally cast.  Transmutation shall not be implied, but must be
      stated explicitly in a Proposal to take effect.
 
========================================

Rule 111 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Conflicts

111.

      In a conflict between a Mutable and an Immutable Rule, the
      immutable Rule takes precedence and the Mutable Rule shall be
      entirely void.  For the purposes of this Rule a Proposal to
      Transmute an Immutable Rule does not "conflict" with that
      Immutable Rule.
 
========================================

Rule 112 (Immutable)
Winning Must Be by Points

112.

      The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered
      from achieving n points to any other state of affairs.  The
      magnitude of n and the means of earning points may be changed,
      and Rules that establish a Winner when play cannot continue may
      be Enacted and (while they are mutable) be Amended or Repealed.
 
========================================

Rule 113 (Immutable)
Players May Always Forfeit

113.

      A Player always has the option to forfeit the Game rather than
      continue to play or incur a Game penalty.  No penalty worse than
      losing, in the judgment of the Player to incur it, may be
      imposed.

========================================

Rule 114 (Immutable)
At Least One Mutable Rule

114.

      There must always be at least one Mutable Rule.  The adoption of
      Rule Changes must never become completely inpermissible.

========================================

Rule 115 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Which Change Rule-Changing Rules Allowed

115.

      Rule Changes that affect Rules needed to allow or apply
      Rule Changes are as permissible as other Rule Changes.  Even
      Rule Changes that amend or repeal their own authority are
      permissible.  No Rule Change or type of move is impermissible
      solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a
      Rule.

========================================

Rule 116 (Immutable)
Permissibility of the Unprohibited

116.

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
      and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
      which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly or
      implicitly permits it.

========================================

Rule 201 (Mutable)
Quorum

201.

      Quorum for a proposed Rule Change is defined to be 20% of Voters
      at the beginning of the prescribed Voting Period for that
      Proposal.

========================================

Rule 206 (Mutable)
One Voter, One Vote

206.

      Each Voter has exactly one Vote.  The Speaker may not Vote.

========================================

Rule 208 (Mutable)
End of the Voting Period

208.

      At the end of the prescribed Voting Period on a Proposal, the
      Speaker shall reveal all Votes legally cast on that Proposal. If
      the Speaker's consent may be required for a Proposal to be
      adopted then the Speaker should indicate at that time whether or
      not e gives eir consent.  If the Speaker does not explicitly
      indicate that e refuses to consent to the Proposal, it shall be
      assumed that e consents.

========================================

Rule 212 (Mutable)
Resolving Rule Conflicts

212.

      If two or more Mutable Rules conflict with one another, or if
      two or more Immutable Rules conflict with one another, then the
      Rule with the lowest ordinal Number takes precedence.
        If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of rule) or takes
      precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.
        If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

========================================

Rule 217 (Mutable)
Judgements Must Accord with the Rules

217.

      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however, if
      the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the Statement
      to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider Game Custom and the
      Spirit of the Game before applying other standards.

========================================

Rule 312 (Mutable)
A Point for Voting

312.

      If a Voter votes, he gets one (1) point at the end of the Voting
      Period.

========================================

Rule 355 (Mutable)
Determining When a Rule Has Been Broken

355.  Determining when a Rule has been broken:

      If a Player believes that any Player has not abided by a Rule
      then in effect, in the form in which it was then in effect, then
      the Player may invoke Judgement on a Statement to that effect.
      However,
        -The Accusing player immediately loses 5 points.
        -No Player may be so Accused of actions committed before the
         adoption of this Rule or more than 30 days before the
         Accusation.
        -No Player may be so Accused more than once concerning the
         same committed act, unless the last such Accusation has been
         judged UNDECIDED.
        -The following exception takes precedence over previous Rules 
         concerning Judgement: Neither Accusing nor Accused Player may
         act as Judge for the Accusation; in any case where this would
         occur, a random Voter, neither Accuser nor Accused, shall be
         Judge.
      If the Statement is judged TRUE, the Accused Player has been
      convicted of breaking the Rule.  If the Statement is judged
      FALSE, the Accused Player has been acquitted of breaking the
      Rule.

========================================

Rule 376 (Mutable)
When Does a Rule Change Take Effect?

376.  Time that a rule change takes effect:

      An adopted rule change takes full effect at the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it.
      The moment of the completion of the vote is defined by the date
      and time given in the line starting with "Date:" of the Nomic
      listserver message send by the Benevolent Speaker, announcing
      the result of the vote on the corresponding proposal.

========================================

Rule 388 (Mutable)
Game Status When a New Game Begins

388.  Starting a new Game:

      Whenever a new game of Nomic is begun, the status of the new
      Game when it begins shall be the same as the status of the old
      Game when it ended, in all respects where the Rules do not
      decide otherwise.

========================================

Rule 399 (Mutable)
The Office of the Rulekeepor

399.  The Office of the Rulekeepor:

      Let there be an Officer known as the Rulekeepor.
      The Rulekeepor shall maintain a complete list of the current
      Rules, and post this list to all Players at least once a week.
      
      So long as the Rulekeepor is in Office, the Speaker is not
      required to maintain or distribute the Rules.

========================================

Rule 402 (Mutable)
Transfer of Power of the Mighty Speaker

402.  Transfer of Power of the Mighty Speaker:

      When one Mighty Speaker is yielding his Office to another, the
      following procedure shall be followed:
      
       1) The Present Mighty Speaker shall forward copies of all
          necessary materials for the performance of his Office to the
          Prospective Mighty Speaker.
       2) The Prospective Mighty Speaker shall acknowledge the receipt
          of said materials.
       3) The Present Mighty Speaker shall post a message to the
          listserv announcing the official transfer of power, which
          occurs at the "Date:" of the Present Mighty Speaker's
          posting.

      The Present Mighty Speaker remains in Office until the successful
      completion of step 3.

========================================

Rule 404 (Mutable)
Legality of Proposals

404.  Legality of Proposals:

      As long as a Proposal satisfies all requirements in place at the
      time of its making for the proper making of Proposals, the act
      of making such a Proposal is legal regardless of its content.
      It is legal to propose a Rule which conflicts with other Rules
      or with itself, which is paradoxical, or which cannot be
      applied.

========================================

Rule 405 (Mutable)
No Vacations for Officers

405.  No Vacations for Officers:

      No Officer may be 'On Hold' while holding an Office.  If a
      current Officer should place himself On Hold, he is assumed to
      have resigned without appointing a successor, and the Office
      should be re-filled in the normal manner.  This Rule takes
      precedence over Rule 386.

========================================

Rule 406 (Mutable)
Clerk of the Courts

406.  Clerk of the Courts, Part I: Definition of Office:

      There shall exist an Office "Clerk of the Courts", who shall
      have general responsibility over administering Calls for
      Judgement, as outlined in the Rules.  The active Clerk of the
      Court may never be selected as a Judge.

      As a salary for carrying out his duties, he will receive 5
      points at the end of every seven days he is in Office, counting
      from his assumption of the Office.

      The initial holder of this Office shall be the Player who
      submitted this Proposal.

========================================

Rule 407 (Mutable)
Invoking Judgement

407.  Clerk of the Courts, Part II: Invoking Judgement:

      If Players disagree about the legality of a Move or the
      interpretation or application of a Rule, then a Player may
      invoke Judgement by submitting a Statement for Judgement to the
      Clerk of the Courts.  Disagreement, for the purposes of this
      Rule, may be created by the insistence of any Player.  When
      Judgement is invoked, the Clerk of the Courts must, as soon as
      possible, select a Judge as described in the Rules.  The Clerk
      of the Courts must then distribute the Statement to be judged,
      along with the identity of the Judge, to all Players.

========================================

Rule 408 (Mutable)
Accepting Judge-ship

408.  Clerk of the Courts, Part III: Accepting Judge-ship:

      After the Clerk of the Courts has distributed the Statement to
      be judged and the identity of the Judge, the Judge has one week
      in which to deliver a legal Judgement.  If the Judge fails to
      deliver a Judgement within this time, e is penalized 10 points
      and a new Judge is selected.  A Judgement is delivered by
      submitting that Judgement to the Clerk of the Courts, who must
      then distribute that Judgement to all Players as soon as
      possible.

========================================

Rule 413 (Mutable)
Winning by Paradox

413.  Winning By Paradox:

      If the Rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or
      if the legality of some action cannot be determined with
      finality, or if some action appears equally legal and illegal,
      then a player may Call For Judgement on a Statement to that
      effect.  If the Statement is judged TRUE, then the same Judge
      who judged the Statement TRUE must declare the most recent
      passed Proposal X such that the Statement was not TRUE before
      the passage of Proposal X, or declare that there is no such
      Proposal.  (Until the Judge does this, the Judgment is not
      valid.)  If the Judgement of TRUE is not overruled, then the
      Player who called for Judgement is declared the Winner of the
      game.
      
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared that
      there is no such Proposal X, the game is ended, with no
      provisions for restarting it.
      
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared such
      a Proposal X, the following actions are taken:
         - all Players remain active,
         - all Proposals curently being Voted upon are removed from
           consideration for Voting,
         - the scores for all Players are set to 0 (zero),
         - the Rules and explicit game custom are reverted to the
           state they were in before Proposal X was passed,
         - a Benevolent Speaker for the next Game is chosen:
              -If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the
               Benevolent Speaker, and the old Benevolent Speaker
               becomes a Voter,
              -If there is more than one Winner, the Benevolent
               Speaker randomly selects one of the Winners, who
               becomes the new Benevolent Speaker, and the old
               Benevolent Speaker becomes a Voter,
         - and a new Game is begun.

========================================

Rule 415 (Mutable)
How To Submit a Proposal

415.  "How a Proposal is Submitted":

      A Proposal by a Voter shall be made by submitting it to the
      Mighty Speaker. As soon as possible after receiving the
      Proposal, the Mighty Speaker shall assign the Proposal a Number
      and distribute the Proposal along with its number to all
      Players.
      
      The Mighty Speaker may also make Proposals. The Mighty Speaker
      must process all pending Voter-submitted Proposals first, and

========================================

Rule 417 (Mutable)
The Nomic Archivist

417.  Establishment of the Office of Archivist:

      That there be established an office known as the Nomic
      Archivist, which shall be governed by the default Rules
      concerning official posts. The initial duties of the Nomic
      Archivist shall be to record the passage and failure of
      Proposals, to maintain a "historical record" (defined below)
      of the Ruleset, to maintain a list of Judgements and their case
      histories, and to maintain a list of game Winners in past games.
      The Archivist is free to comment on the historical records as
      they see fit, but such commentary must be clearly delimited
      from the historical material. Where the material being stored
      does not already admit a classification method, the Archivist
      is free to design one themselves.

      The "historical record" of the Ruleset maintained by the
      Archivist is one that includes all rules ever part of the nomic
      Ruleset, annotated with information as to their ultimate fate,
      whether Repealed or Amended etc. This record of the Ruleset has
      no legal force.

      The duties required of the Archivist may be changed with their
      consent and at the request of the Office's controlling body
      (whatsoever that may be). Initially, the controlling body of
      this Office shall be all Players, and any request to change the
      duties must therefore be supported by a majority of Players
      "speaking" to the request.  Naturally, default Rules for
      Offices may establish a different controlling body for this
      Office.
      
      The salary of the Archivist office shall be determined by its
      controlling body. Initially, its salary shall be 5 points and
      one coin of the office-holder's group per week.
      
      The initial office-holder for this post shall be Michael
      Norrish.

========================================

Rule 434 (Mutable)
Game May Be Won By CFJ

434.  Judgement Required to Win (and Timing of Win):

      If a Player believes that he has won the Game, he may submit a
      CFJ to that effect.  If it is returned with the Judgement TRUE
      (and that Judgement is not Appealed), then he has won the Game
      as of the delivery of that Judgement.  If the Judgement is TRUE,
      but is Appealed, but is sustained (and no Proposal to reverse
      the verdict is made), then he has won the Game as of the
      delivery of the Appeal verdict.  If such a verdict is sustained,
      challenged by Proposal, but the Proposal does not pass, he has
      won the Game as of the completion of the Vote on that Proposal.

      Judgement on a CFJ to win the Game may *not* be delivered until
      at least 72 hours after its official announcement, in order to
      give time for the Judge to accept input from the community.

      This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which specifies
      the exact moment at which a Game is won.

[Note: Implicit Game Custom dictates that, despite the title,
this rule does not *require* a CFJ in order to win the game.]

========================================

Rule 450 (Mutable)
Game Entities May Not Be Arbitrarily Changed

450.  Game Entities may not be Arbitrarily Changed:

      Any Entity which is created by the Nomic Rules, and which exists only
      within the context of the current Game of Nomic, such as Points,
      Votes, etc. may *not* be changed by any action other than those
      specified by the Rules.

========================================

Rule 451 (Mutable)
Determination of Judgement--Timing

451.  Timing of CFJ Results:

      When a CFJ makes a Statement about the current state of the
      Game, the result of that CFJ shall be TRUE if and only if the
      Judge feels that that Statement was correct at the time that the
      CFJ was *issued*. Any changes that have happened in the time
      between the issuing of the CFJ and its delivery must be figured
      in to find the correct current state.

      Amended to read:

      A Proposal may contain one or more Rule Changes. If the Proposal
      is Adopted, then the Rule Change(s) contained within that
      Proposal shall take effect. No Proposal may Enact or Amend more
      than one Rule.

THE CURRENT RULESET
Part 1 of 5 

Rules are listed as follows, where NNN represents the Rule number:

========================================

Rule NNN (Immutable or Mutable)
My Own Unofficial Title

NNN.  Semi-Official Rule Title, If There Is One

      Text of Rule

[Note:  I have annotated some Rules to clarify their interpretation.
However, these annotations have no legal force in and of themselves.]

========================================



========================================

Rule 101 (Immutable)
Obey the Rules

101.

      All Players must always abide by all the Rules then in effect,
      in the form in which they are then in effect.  The Rules in the
      Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the first game.
      The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (Immutable) and
      201-219 (Mutable).

========================================

Rule 102 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Rules

102.

      Initially Rules in the 100's are Immutable and Rules in the
      200's are Mutable.  Rules subsequently Enacted or Transmuted
      (that is, changed from Immutable to Mutable or vice versa) may
      be Immutable or Mutable regardless of their Numbers, and Rules
      in the Initial Set may be Transmuted regardless of their Numbers.

========================================

Rule 103 (Immutable)
The Speaker and Voters

103.

      At any time, each Player shall be either a Voter or the Speaker;
      no Player may simultaneously be a Voter and a Speaker. At any
      time, there shall be exactly one Speaker. The term "Player" in
      the Rules shall specifically include both the Voters and the
      Speaker.

========================================

Rule 104 (Immutable)
First Speaker

104.

      The Speaker for the first game shall be Michael Norrish.

========================================

Rule 105 (Immutable)
What Is a Rule Change?

105.

      A Rule Change is any of the following:  (1) the enactment,
      repeal, or amendment of a mutable Rule; or (2) the transmutation
      of an immutable Rule into a mutable Rule or vice versa.
        (Note:  This definition implies that, at least initially, all
      new Rules are Mutable; Immutable Rules, as long as they are
      Immutable, may not be Amended or Repealed; Mutable Rules, as long
      as they are Mutable, may be Amended or Repealed; any Rule of any
      status may be Transmuted; no Rule is absolutely immune to change.)

========================================

Rule 106 (Immutable)
Adopting Proposed Rule Changes

106.

      All Rule Changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on.
      They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required
      number of votes and Quorum is achieved.

========================================

Rule 107 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Must Be Written Down

107.

      Any proposed Rule Change must be written down (or otherwise
      communicated in print media) before it is voted on. If adopted,
      it must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.

========================================

Rule 108 (Immutable)
When May Rule Changes Take Effect?

108.

      No Rule Change may take effect earlier than the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording
      explicitly states otherwise.  No rule change may have retroactive
      application.

========================================

Rule 109 (Immutable)
Rule Numbers

109.

      The Speaker shall give each proposed Rule Change a Number for
      reference.  The numbers shall begin with 301, and each Rule
      Change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next
      successive integer, whether or not the Proposal is adopted.
        If a Rule is Repealed and Reenacted, it receives the Number of
      the Proposal to Reenact it.  If a Rule is Amended or Transmuted,
      it receives the Number of the Proposal to Amend or Transmute it.
 
========================================

Rule 110 (Immutable)
Transmutation of Rules

110.

      Rule Changes that Transmute Immutable Rules into Mutable Rules
      may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among Votes
      legally cast.  Transmutation shall not be implied, but must be
      stated explicitly in a Proposal to take effect.
 
========================================

Rule 111 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Conflicts

111.

      In a conflict between a Mutable and an Immutable Rule, the
      immutable Rule takes precedence and the Mutable Rule shall be
      entirely void.  For the purposes of this Rule a Proposal to
      Transmute an Immutable Rule does not "conflict" with that
      Immutable Rule.
 
========================================

Rule 112 (Immutable)
Winning Must Be by Points

112.

      The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered
      from achieving n points to any other state of affairs.  The
      magnitude of n and the means of earning points may be changed,
      and Rules that establish a Winner when play cannot continue may
      be Enacted and (while they are mutable) be Amended or Repealed.
 
========================================

Rule 113 (Immutable)
Players May Always Forfeit

113.

      A Player always has the option to forfeit the Game rather than
      continue to play or incur a Game penalty.  No penalty worse than
      losing, in the judgment of the Player to incur it, may be
      imposed.

========================================

Rule 114 (Immutable)
At Least One Mutable Rule

114.

      There must always be at least one Mutable Rule.  The adoption of
      Rule Changes must never become completely inpermissible.

========================================

Rule 115 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Which Change Rule-Changing Rules Allowed

115.

      Rule Changes that affect Rules needed to allow or apply
      Rule Changes are as permissible as other Rule Changes.  Even
      Rule Changes that amend or repeal their own authority are
      permissible.  No Rule Change or type of move is impermissible
      solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a
      Rule.

========================================

Rule 116 (Immutable)
Permissibility of the Unprohibited

116.

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
      and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
      which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly or
      implicitly permits it.

========================================

Rule 201 (Mutable)
Quorum

201.

      Quorum for a proposed Rule Change is defined to be 20% of Voters
      at the beginning of the prescribed Voting Period for that
      Proposal.

========================================

Rule 206 (Mutable)
One Voter, One Vote

206.

      Each Voter has exactly one Vote.  The Speaker may not Vote.

========================================

Rule 208 (Mutable)
End of the Voting Period

208.

      At the end of the prescribed Voting Period on a Proposal, the
      Speaker shall reveal all Votes legally cast on that Proposal. If
      the Speaker's consent may be required for a Proposal to be
      adopted then the Speaker should indicate at that time whether or
      not e gives eir consent.  If the Speaker does not explicitly
      indicate that e refuses to consent to the Proposal, it shall be
      assumed that e consents.

========================================

Rule 212 (Mutable)
Resolving Rule Conflicts

212.

      If two or more Mutable Rules conflict with one another, or if
      two or more Immutable Rules conflict with one another, then the
      Rule with the lowest ordinal Number takes precedence.
        If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of rule) or takes
      precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.
        If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

========================================

Rule 217 (Mutable)
Judgements Must Accord with the Rules

217.

      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however, if
      the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the Statement
      to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider Game Custom and the
      Spirit of the Game before applying other standards.

========================================

Rule 312 (Mutable)
A Point for Voting

312.

      If a Voter votes, he gets one (1) point at the end of the Voting
      Period.

========================================

Rule 355 (Mutable)
Determining When a Rule Has Been Broken

355.  Determining when a Rule has been broken:

      If a Player believes that any Player has not abided by a Rule
      then in effect, in the form in which it was then in effect, then
      the Player may invoke Judgement on a Statement to that effect.
      However,
        -The Accusing player immediately loses 5 points.
        -No Player may be so Accused of actions committed before the
         adoption of this Rule or more than 30 days before the
         Accusation.
        -No Player may be so Accused more than once concerning the
         same committed act, unless the last such Accusation has been
         judged UNDECIDED.
        -The following exception takes precedence over previous Rules 
         concerning Judgement: Neither Accusing nor Accused Player may
         act as Judge for the Accusation; in any case where this would
         occur, a random Voter, neither Accuser nor Accused, shall be
         Judge.
      If the Statement is judged TRUE, the Accused Player has been
      convicted of breaking the Rule.  If the Statement is judged
      FALSE, the Accused Player has been acquitted of breaking the
      Rule.

========================================

Rule 376 (Mutable)
When Does a Rule Change Take Effect?

376.  Time that a rule change takes effect:

      An adopted rule change takes full effect at the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it.
      The moment of the completion of the vote is defined by the date
      and time given in the line starting with "Date:" of the Nomic
      listserver message send by the Benevolent Speaker, announcing
      the result of the vote on the corresponding proposal.

========================================

Rule 388 (Mutable)
Game Status When a New Game Begins

388.  Starting a new Game:

      Whenever a new game of Nomic is begun, the status of the new
      Game when it begins shall be the same as the status of the old
      Game when it ended, in all respects where the Rules do not
      decide otherwise.

========================================

Rule 399 (Mutable)
The Office of the Rulekeepor

399.  The Office of the Rulekeepor:

      Let there be an Officer known as the Rulekeepor.
      The Rulekeepor shall maintain a complete list of the current
      Rules, and post this list to all Players at least once a week.
      
      So long as the Rulekeepor is in Office, the Speaker is not
      required to maintain or distribute the Rules.

========================================

Rule 402 (Mutable)
Transfer of Power of the Mighty Speaker

402.  Transfer of Power of the Mighty Speaker:

      When one Mighty Speaker is yielding his Office to another, the
      following procedure shall be followed:
      
       1) The Present Mighty Speaker shall forward copies of all
          necessary materials for the performance of his Office to the
          Prospective Mighty Speaker.
       2) The Prospective Mighty Speaker shall acknowledge the receipt
          of said materials.
       3) The Present Mighty Speaker shall post a message to the
          listserv announcing the official transfer of power, which
          occurs at the "Date:" of the Present Mighty Speaker's
          posting.

      The Present Mighty Speaker remains in Office until the successful
      completion of step 3.

========================================

Rule 404 (Mutable)
Legality of Proposals

404.  Legality of Proposals:

      As long as a Proposal satisfies all requirements in place at the
      time of its making for the proper making of Proposals, the act
      of making such a Proposal is legal regardless of its content.
      It is legal to propose a Rule which conflicts with other Rules
      or with itself, which is paradoxical, or which cannot be
      applied.

========================================

Rule 405 (Mutable)
No Vacations for Officers

405.  No Vacations for Officers:

      No Officer may be 'On Hold' while holding an Office.  If a
      current Officer should place himself On Hold, he is assumed to
      have resigned without appointing a successor, and the Office
      should be re-filled in the normal manner.  This Rule takes
      precedence over Rule 386.

========================================

Rule 406 (Mutable)
Clerk of the Courts

406.  Clerk of the Courts, Part I: Definition of Office:

      There shall exist an Office "Clerk of the Courts", who shall
      have general responsibility over administering Calls for
      Judgement, as outlined in the Rules.  The active Clerk of the
      Court may never be selected as a Judge.

      As a salary for carrying out his duties, he will receive 5
      points at the end of every seven days he is in Office, counting
      from his assumption of the Office.

      The initial holder of this Office shall be the Player who
      submitted this Proposal.

========================================

Rule 407 (Mutable)
Invoking Judgement

407.  Clerk of the Courts, Part II: Invoking Judgement:

      If Players disagree about the legality of a Move or the
      interpretation or application of a Rule, then a Player may
      invoke Judgement by submitting a Statement for Judgement to the
      Clerk of the Courts.  Disagreement, for the purposes of this
      Rule, may be created by the insistence of any Player.  When
      Judgement is invoked, the Clerk of the Courts must, as soon as
      possible, select a Judge as described in the Rules.  The Clerk
      of the Courts must then distribute the Statement to be judged,
      along with the identity of the Judge, to all Players.

========================================

Rule 408 (Mutable)
Accepting Judge-ship

408.  Clerk of the Courts, Part III: Accepting Judge-ship:

      After the Clerk of the Courts has distributed the Statement to
      be judged and the identity of the Judge, the Judge has one week
      in which to deliver a legal Judgement.  If the Judge fails to
      deliver a Judgement within this time, e is penalized 10 points
      and a new Judge is selected.  A Judgement is delivered by
      submitting that Judgement to the Clerk of the Courts, who must
      then distribute that Judgement to all Players as soon as
      possible.

========================================

Rule 413 (Mutable)
Winning by Paradox

413.  Winning By Paradox:

      If the Rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or
      if the legality of some action cannot be determined with
      finality, or if some action appears equally legal and illegal,
      then a player may Call For Judgement on a Statement to that
      effect.  If the Statement is judged TRUE, then the same Judge
      who judged the Statement TRUE must declare the most recent
      passed Proposal X such that the Statement was not TRUE before
      the passage of Proposal X, or declare that there is no such
      Proposal.  (Until the Judge does this, the Judgment is not
      valid.)  If the Judgement of TRUE is not overruled, then the
      Player who called for Judgement is declared the Winner of the
      game.
      
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared that
      there is no such Proposal X, the game is ended, with no
      provisions for restarting it.
      
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared such
      a Proposal X, the following actions are taken:
         - all Players remain active,
         - all Proposals curently being Voted upon are removed from
           consideration for Voting,
         - the scores for all Players are set to 0 (zero),
         - the Rules and explicit game custom are reverted to the
           state they were in before Proposal X was passed,
         - a Benevolent Speaker for the next Game is chosen:
              -If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the
               Benevolent Speaker, and the old Benevolent Speaker
               becomes a Voter,
              -If there is more than one Winner, the Benevolent
               Speaker randomly selects one of the Winners, who
               becomes the new Benevolent Speaker, and the old
               Benevolent Speaker becomes a Voter,
         - and a new Game is begun.

========================================

Rule 415 (Mutable)
How To Submit a Proposal

415.  "How a Proposal is Submitted":

      A Proposal by a Voter shall be made by submitting it to the
      Mighty Speaker. As soon as possible after receiving the
      Proposal, the Mighty Speaker shall assign the Proposal a Number
      and distribute the Proposal along with its number to all
      Players.
      
      The Mighty Speaker may also make Proposals. The Mighty Speaker
      must process all pending Voter-submitted Proposals first, and
      may then Process Proposals of the Mighty Speaker, assigning
      these Proposals a number and distributing them in the same
      fashion as any other Proposal.

========================================

Rule 417 (Mutable)
The Nomic Archivist

417.  Establishment of the Office of Archivist:

      That there be established an office known as the Nomic
      Archivist, which shall be governed by the default Rules
      concerning official posts. The initial duties of the Nomic
      Archivist shall be to record the passage and failure of
      Proposals, to maintain a "historical record" (defined below)
      of the Ruleset, to maintain a list of Judgements and their case
      histories, and to maintain a list of game Winners in past games.
      The Archivist is free to comment on the historical records as
      they see fit, but such commentary must be clearly delimited
      from the historical material. Where the material being stored
      does not already admit a classification method, the Archivist
      is free to design one themselves.

      The "historical record" of the Ruleset maintained by the
      Archivist is one that includes all rules ever part of the nomic
      Ruleset, annotated with information as to their ultimate fate,
      whether Repealed or Amended etc. This record of the Ruleset has
      no legal force.

      The duties required of the Archivist may be changed with their
      consent and at the request of the Office's controlling body
      (whatsoever that may be). Initially, the controlling body of
      this Office shall be all Players, and any request to change the
      duties must therefore be supported by a majority of Players
      "speaking" to the request.  Naturally, default Rules for
      Offices may establish a different controlling body for this
      Office.
      
      The salary of the Archivist office shall be determined by its
      controlling body. Initially, its salary shall be 5 points and
      one coin of the office-holder's group per week.
      
      The initial office-holder for this post shall be Michael
      Norrish.

========================================

Rule 434 (Mutable)
Game May Be Won By CFJ

434.  Judgement Required to Win (and Timing of Win):

      If a Player believes that he has won the Game, he may submit a
      CFJ to that effect.  If it is returned with the Judgement TRUE
      (and that Judgement is not Appealed), then he has won the Game
      as of the delivery of that Judgement.  If the Judgement is TRUE,
      but is Appealed, but is sustained (and no Proposal to reverse
      the verdict is made), then he has won the Game as of the
      delivery of the Appeal verdict.  If such a verdict is sustained,
      challenged by Proposal, but the Proposal does not pass, he has
      won the Game as of the completion of the Vote on that Proposal.

      Judgement on a CFJ to win the Game may *not* be delivered until
      at least 72 hours after its official announcement, in order to
      give time for the Judge to accept input from the community.

      This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which specifies
      the exact moment at which a Game is won.

[Note: Implicit Game Custom dictates that, despite the title,
this rule does not *require* a CFJ in order to win the game.]

========================================

Rule 450 (Mutable)
Game Entities May Not Be Arbitrarily Changed

450.  Game Entities may not be Arbitrarily Changed:

      Any Entity which is created by the Nomic Rules, and which exists only
      within the context of the current Game of Nomic, such as Points,
      Votes, etc. may *not* be changed by any action other than those
      specified by the Rules.

========================================

Rule 451 (Mutable)
Determination of Judgement--Timing

451.  Timing of CFJ Results:

      When a CFJ makes a Statement about the current state of the
      Game, the result of that CFJ shall be TRUE if and only if the
      Judge feels that that Statement was correct at the time that the
      CFJ was *issued*. Any changes that have happened in the time
      between the issuing of the CFJ and its delivery must be figured
      in to find the correct current state.

========================================

Rule 597 (Mutable)
Titles for Proposals

597.  Informative Titles II

      Every Proposal shall be headed with a Title. This Title shall
      not actually be a part of the Proposal itself and therefore
      shall not become a part of any Rule Enacted or Amended by that
      Proposal. If a Proposal is not headed with a Title, then the
      Player who submitted that Proposal shall be guilty of a Class B
      Crime.

========================================

Rule 600 (Mutable)
Public Accusations

600.  Notification of Accusation

      To formally Accuse a Player of committing a Crime, the Accusing
      Player must send a message to the Public Forum stating the
      Accused Player, the Class of Crime which e is being Accused of,
      and why e believes that the Accused Player is GUILTY.

========================================

Rule 602 (Mutable)
CFJ's Are Ineffective When a Criminal Court Is More Appropriate

602.  Criminal Court over Judgements

      No Call for Judgement may cause a Player to be punished for a
      Crime, or to be declared GUILTY of a Crime. Such Judgements
      should instead be done through a Criminal Court.

========================================

Rule 604 (Mutable)

      Criminal Court may not be called for in regards to any Crime
      which has taken place more than ten days previously.

Rule 605 (Mutable)
No Double Jeopardy

605.  Criminal Double Jeapordy

      A Player may only be found GUILTY once for a particular instance
      of a particular Crime. If a Player admits to being GUILTY while
      a Criminal Court is in session to find that Player GUILTY, e
      shall suffer the penalties as if e had been found GUILTY by a

663.  General Rules For Injunctions

      There shall be an entity known as an Injunction, which may
      accompany certain Judgements of TRUE or FALSE as provided in the
      rules. An Injunction is a statement or series of statements
      specifying an action or actions which must take place. If a
      Judgement is is accompanied by an Injunction, that Injunction
      must be published with the Judgement. All players must abide by
      the Injunction beginning no later than 72 hours after its
      publication unless one of the following conditions then apply:
        - The Judgement which the Injunction accompanies is undergoing
          appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of the appeal
          process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but a proposal
          has been published which would overturn that decision if
          passed, and said proposal has not failed.
        - The validity of the Injunction itself is questioned by a
          pending CFJ.
        - A Judgement upholding the validity of the Injunction is
          undergoing appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of
          the appeal process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but
          a proposal has been published which would overturn that
          decision if passed, and said proposal has not failed.

      A Judgement may not be accompanied by an Injunction unless it is
      specifically permitted elsewhere in the rules. An Injunction
      must be completely consistent with all rules in effect at the
      time of issuance, and must be completely relevant to the matter
      addressed in the corresponding judgement.

      If any Player believes that an Injunction or any part of it does
      not meet the criteria for a valid Injunction, e may submit a CFJ
      to that effect. If the resulting Judgement supports the
      contention that the criteria are not met, the Injunction shall
      be considered illegal and shall have no legal force.

      This rule takes precedence over all rules governing Injunctions.

========================================

Rule 664 (Mutable)
Illegal Injuctions are Crimes

Injuction--Retracting an Illegal Move

665.  Specific Injunctions, part I

      Judgement supports the allegation, the Judge may include with
      the Judgement an Injunction specifying that the move is to be
      retracted, and any resulting adjustments to the published game
      state. The adjustments to the game state must have been
      unambiguously specified within the CFJ, and these adjustments
      must only undo actions which were a direct or indirect result of
      that Move.

Rule 669 (Mutable)
To Disobey an Injunction is Criminal

669.  Contempt of Court

      recent Clerk of the Courts. A tentative replacement shall be
      asked if e wants the Office, and if not, a new one shall be
      selected in the same manner.

      require the Clerk of the Courts to fill a vacant Office of Clerk
      of the Courts.

Rule 663 (Mutable)
Injunctions--General

663.  General Rules For Injunctions

      There shall be an entity known as an Injunction, which may
      accompany certain Judgements of TRUE or FALSE as provided in the
      rules. An Injunction is a statement or series of statements
      specifying an action or actions which must take place. If a
      Judgement is is accompanied by an Injunction, that Injunction
      must be published with the Judgement. All players must abide by
      the Injunction beginning no later than 72 hours after its
      publication unless one of the following conditions then apply:
        - The Judgement which the Injunction accompanies is undergoing
          appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of the appeal
          process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but a proposal
          has been published which would overturn that decision if
          passed, and said proposal has not failed.
        - The validity of the Injunction itself is questioned by a
          pending CFJ.
        - A Judgement upholding the validity of the Injunction is
          undergoing appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of
          the appeal process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but
          a proposal has been published which would overturn that
          decision if passed, and said proposal has not failed.

      A Judgement may not be accompanied by an Injunction unless it is
      specifically permitted elsewhere in the rules. An Injunction
      must be completely consistent with all rules in effect at the
      time of issuance, and must be completely relevant to the matter
      addressed in the corresponding judgement.

      If any Player believes that an Injunction or any part of it does
      not meet the criteria for a valid Injunction, e may submit a CFJ
      to that effect. If the resulting Judgement supports the
      contention that the criteria are not met, the Injunction shall
      be considered illegal and shall have no legal force.

      This rule takes precedence over all rules governing Injunctions.

========================================

Rule 664 (Mutable)
Illegal Injuctions are Crimes

Injuction--Retracting an Illegal Move

      Judgement supports the allegation, the Judge may include with
      the Judgement an Injunction specifying that the move is to be
      retracted, and any resulting adjustments to the published game
      state. The adjustments to the game state must have been
      unambiguously specified within the CFJ, and these adjustments
      must only undo actions which were a direct or indirect result of
      that Move.

========================================

Rule 669 (Mutable)
To Disobey an Injunction is Criminal

669.  Contempt of Court

      If the rules require a Player to obey an Injunction and e fails
      to do so, then a Criminal Court may find that Player GUILTY of a

      recent Clerk of the Courts. A tentative replacement shall be
      asked if e wants the Office, and if not, a new one shall be
      selected in the same manner.

Rule 710 (Mutable)
Criminal Court

710.  Criminal Court Amendment

      If a Player has been formally Accused of a Crime and that Player
      denies that a Crime was committed, or the Accused Player does
      not respond to the Accusation within 72 hours, or within 72
      hours of the time that the Accused Player ceases to be On Hold,
      should e be On Hold when the Accusation is made, then the
      Accusing Player may call for Criminal Court. To do so, the
      Accusing Player shall notify the Clerk of the Courts of the
      intent to begin Criminal Court and shall send a copy of the
      Accusation to the Clerk of the Courts.
      A Judge is then selected exactly as in the case of a call for
      Judgement, and Players are notified exactly as in the case of a
      call for Judgement, except that the reasons for the Guilt of the
      Accused need not be distributed to all Players, only the
      Accusing Player, the Accused, and the Crime. When a Judge has
      been finally selected, the Clerk of the Courts shall notify the
      Accusing and the Accused Player of the identity of the Judge.

      As soon as the Accused Player, who shall be known as the
      Defendant, and the Accusing Player, who shall be known as the
      Prosecuter, have been notified of the identity of the Judge who
      has accepted the appointment, they shall both send all pertinent
      information regarding this Crime to the Judge. When each party
      has sent all information, they shall indicate so by explicitly
      stating such in their last message to the Judge. The Judge then
      has one week from the time at which both such messgaes have been
      recieved to return a Verdict, following all Rules exactly as if
      returning a Judgement in the case of a call for Judgement. The
      Judge shall not return a Verdict until at least 72 hours after
      the identity of the Judge is announced so that other interested
      Players can also send information to the Judge.

      A Verdict may be GUILTY, NOT GUILTY, or UNDECIDED. If the
      Verdict is GUILTY, then the Defendant shall suffer all the
      penalties relevant to the Class of Crime of which e was found
      GUILTY. If the Verdict is NOT GUILTY, then there shall be no
      effect. If the Verdict is UNDECIDED, then it shall be as if
      there had been no Criminal Court.  A Criminal Court may be
      Appealed exactly as a Call for Judgement may be Appealed,
      except that all information pertinent to the Court shall be
      given to all involved in the Appeal, and if the Appeal OVERRULES
      the Verdict, then the process of a Criminal Court shall occur
      again automatically.
      If other Rules designate another Appeals system for a Criminal
      Court, those Rules shall take precedence over this Rule.

      score shall be increased to the Poverty Line by transferring
      points from the Point Reserve, provided there are sufficient
      points therein to cover all such transfers.

      A Player shall not receive points under this rule if e
      voluntarily transferred points to another Player during the
      previous Nomic Week.

        - If there is more than one Winner, the Voter with the highest Point 
          total becomes the new Speaker.  If more than one Voter is
          tied for the highest score, the old Speaker randomly selects
          one of them to become the new Speaker.  The old Speaker
          becomes a voter.

Rule 725 (Mutable)
Stocks

725.  Timing of Stock point transfer.

      Let there be for each Player one Currency called X Stock,
      where X is the name of the Player.

      On Friday Noon GMT 5% of the Points of Player X (with a minimum
      of two Points) shall be transfered to the Player (or Players)
      who holds Stock X.

      At the passing of this Proposal the Bank has possession of all
      Stocks.  During the following week the Banker shall collect the
      bids in Marks.  Those bids have to be made by the Players
      (either alone or acting together on the same Stock) in a message
      to the server.  No bid shall be made, which can not be covered
      by the Marks in  he bidders Bank account (to be verified by the
      Banker.)

      After one week each of the Stocks shall be transfered from the
      Bank to the highest bidder. If two or more bids for Stock X are
      exactly equal, the Stock shall go to player X (if one of the
      highest bidders), or to the Player with the lowest score.

      If a given Stock X is bought by Player X, the Marks of the bid
      shall be transfered from Player X to the Bank.
      If a given Stock X is bought by another Player (or Players) then
      Player X, the Marks of the bid shall go from this Player(s) to
      Player X.

      If Stock X was held at that time by another Player, this Player
      shall be compensated with half the price in Marks that this
      Player paid for the Stock X.
      These Marks shall come from the account of Player X, *before*
      those shall be destroyed, as required by other Rules.
      If there are not enough Marks available, the deficit shall be

Rule 733 (Mutable)
Default Rules for Officers

733.  Default Rules for Officers

      An Official is any Player who has been Appointed or Elected to

      An Officer may be replaced by another Player, by a Proposal
      stating so, and that Proposal passes.
      An Officer may resign at any time, provided e appoints a
      successor.
      If an Officer resigns while a Proposal is being voted upon to
      replace eim, the Player proposed will by eis Successor.
      This Rule applies to general Offices, and therefore defers to
      Rules for specific Offices.

The Marxist

736.  The Marxist

      Let there be the Patent Title known as "Marxist", which is
      awarded to the Player with the most Marks, or if tied, to the
      Players with the most Marks. Only the current richest Player
      or Players may hold this title.

      The determination and announcement of assignment and revoking
      of the Title is made by the Banker, who must use the most
      accurate means of determining this available to eim, and must
      make the announcement as soon as possible after becoming aware
      of a change in holder of the Title.

      However: To respect some Players' wish for privacy, and in
      view of the secret nature of Marks accounts, a prospective
      Marxist must first be asked if e wants the Title. If not, then
      instead of announcing, "Player x is granted the Patent Title of
      'Marxist', e announces, "Patent Title of 'Marxist' is granted
       to an anonymous Player".

      Quantity is given to an Entity, and no Rule states where that
      Conserved Quantity is to be taken from, then the transfer shall
      not take place. If a Conserved Quantity is taken from an Entity,

      forum stating what  Nomic entity is up for Auction, and that e
      is accepting bids.
 
      Players who wish to participate in the Auction then must
      indicate their interest by sending a bid to the Auctioneer.

Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal

761.  Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal: Adjusting for Abstentions

      When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the Votes which
      have been legally cast shall be counted by the Speaker. If a
      Proposal is not Contested, and there are more FOR votes cast
      then AGAINST votes, then that Proposal shall take effect.  If
      such a Proposal has an equal number of FOR and AGAINST Votes,
      then the Speaker shall decide whether the Proposal shall be
      Adopted, or if that Proposal shall fail. If the Proposal is
      Contested, and the number of FOR votes cast is at least twice

      effect.

      If a Rule will change the actions required of or forbidden to
      the Speaker, and the Speaker opposed the Proposal, then that

      Treasury as specified in the Y Ordinances.  If the Y Ordinances
      are silent on this issue, or if Group Y has ceased to exist,

      downwards, shall be transferred to Player X, where N is the
      number of Members of Group Y immediately before Player X ceased
      to be a Member of Group Y.  This transfer is not taxable, and

Mischief

      Any Player or Group X may perform an Act of Mischief directed
      at any Player or Group Y.  The permissible forms of Mischief
      are defined in other Rules; such definitions must include a 
      positive Price in Coins, or the form of Mischief is not
      permissible.  This Rule explicitly takes precedence over all
      other Rules which purport to determine which forms of Mischief
      are permissible.

      To cause an Act of Mischief,  X  sends to the Public Forum a
      message containing:
      - the Name of the object, Y;
      - the effect of the Act of Mischief;
      - the Number of the Rule which permits the form of Mischief;
      - indication of which Coins in X's account will be used as
      payment for the Act of Mischief.  Coins of Group Y, or the
      Group to which Player Y belongs, may not be used as payment.  

      The effect of the Act of Mischief is applied immediately upon 
      publication of the above message in the Forum.  An additional
      effect of this Act of Mischief is that
      - for each Coin of Group Z spent as payment above, two Points
      are removed from the Z Treasury;
      - the Coins used as payment above are removed from X's account
      and destroyed.

Rule 766 (Mutable)
Groups

766.  Amend Rule 714.

      A Group is initially formed by a set of Players which has
      registered with the Registrar to form a Group; other Players may
      join later.  Each Group has a Name, a Membership, a Vizier,
      an Ordinancekeepor, a Treasury, an Initial Set of Ordinances,
      and an associated form of Currency, called the <name> Coins,
      where <name> is the Name of the Group.

      1.  The Name may not be the Name of another Group.

      2.  The Membership is a set of Players;  these Players are
      Members of the Group, and all other Players are not.

      3.  Synchronously with the registration of a Group, two Offices
      are created known as the <name> Vizier, and the <name>
      Ordinancekeepor, where <name> is the Name of the Group.
      These Offices may never be empty, and the <name> Vizier and
      <name> Ordinancekeepor must both be a member of <name> Group.
      The <name> Vizier shall inform the Registrar whenever the
      Membership or the Ordinancekeepor of the <name> group changes.
      When the <name> Vizier changes, the new Vizier shall inform the
      Registrar of the change.
      The <name> Ordinancekeepor shall keep an accurate and current
      record of the Ordinances of the <name> Group.

      4.  The Treasury is a repository for Points and Currencies and
      has the same capabilities for holding, trading, and spending
      Points and Currencies as does a Player.

      5.  The Ordinances are a description of the operation of the
      Group.

      6.  The <name> Coins are a form of Currency which is created
      synchronously with the registration of the Group.  The <name>
      Group may create <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be
      placed in the <name> Treasury.  The <name> Group may destroy
      <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be removed from the
      <name> Treasury.

      Ordinances of a Group may determine how and when the Group
      casts its Votes; if the Ordinances are silent on this issue

      When a Player submits a Proposal, e may pay one Mark to the Bank

      E must inform both the Banker and the Speaker when doing so.
      A Proposal which has Sanity imposed upon it is known as a Sane
      Proposal.  The Speaker shall, when e distributes a Sane
      Proposal, inform the Players that it is a Sane Proposal.

      No non-Voter Nomic entity may Vote on a Sane Proposal.  Each
      Voter shall have exactly one Vote on a Sane Proposal, and
      each Voter's Vote shall be counted exactly once on a Sane
      Proposal.

      This rule takes precedence over any rule allowing a non-Voter
      Nomic entity to Vote; over any rule which gives any Voter
      more or less than one Vote on a proposal; and over any
      rule which would cause any Voter's Vote to be counted more or

      Judge must issue an Injunction that the Ninny submit a Formal

      least 200 words, containing all of the Prescribed Words,
      explaining the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
      for self-improvement, and posted in the Public Forum.  Within 48

      either submit a Proposal that the Ninny's Apology be accepted,
      or submit a Proposal that the Ninny's Aplology be rejected,

Abandonment of Speakerhood

785.  Improve Speaker Succession I

      If the Speaker has abandoned eir post, another new, Temporary
      Speaker is selected according to the "Rules of Succession", or
      if no such rules are defined, the other Player not on hold with
      the highest Score becomes the temporary Speaker.  This does not
      force the Game to be over in this case, and Scores are not reset
      to 0. The Game continues until a Player Wins, at which time a
      new Game is begun and the Winner becomes the real Speaker. The
      Temporary Speaker shall make reasonable effort to obtain the
      former Speaker's materials: proposal queue, voting records, etc.
      but if this is not possible, then the Temporary Speaker shall
      request that these be resubmitted by the Players. If a Speaker
      is replaced in this manner, e has eir score set to minus 2N
      Points immediately, where N is the number of Points required for
      a Player to Win the Game.

      Abandonment is determined as follows: If any Player suspects
      that the Speaker has Abandoned, e sends a message to all Players
      calling on the Speaker to announce eir presence.  The Speaker
      must reply to all Players within one week; if e does not, e is

      If a Player believes that the circumstances which led to the
      Judgement no longer prevail and the annotation is therefore no

      Proposal in addition to those of its Membership.  The
      Ordinances of a Group may determine how and when the Group
      casts its Votes; if the Ordinances are silent on this issue
      then the Group may not cast its Votes.  The Votes of the

      A Proposal which has Sanity imposed upon it is known as a Sane
      Proposal.  The Speaker shall, when e distributes a Sane
      Proposal, inform the Players that it is a Sane Proposal.

      Voter shall have exactly one Vote on a Sane Proposal, and
      each Voter's Vote shall be counted exactly once on a Sane
      Proposal.

      This rule takes precedence over any rule allowing a non-Voter
      Nomic entity to Vote; over any rule which gives any Voter
      more or less than one Vote on a proposal; and over any
      rule which would cause any Voter's Vote to be counted more or
      less than once.

      Judgement alleging that a Player (herein called the Ninny) has
      acted or has failed to act in such a way as to be in violation
      of one or more Rules, and this CFJ is Judged TRUE, then the
      Judge must issue an Injunction that the Ninny submit a Formal
      Apology.  This Injunction may also include a list of up to ten
      Prescribed Words.  By a Formal Apology is meant a letter of at
      least 200 words, containing all of the Prescribed Words,
      explaining the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
      for self-improvement, and posted in the Public Forum.  Within 48

      either submit a Proposal that the Ninny's Apology be accepted,
      or submit a Proposal that the Ninny's Aplology be rejected,
      but not both.  No other Player may submit such a Proposal, and
      the Squealer may submit only one.  If a Proposal to accept the
      Apology fails, or if a Proposal to reject the Apology passes,
      then the Ninny loses 5 Points.

Rule 785 (Mutable)
Abandonment of Speakerhood

785.  Improve Speaker Succession I

      If the Speaker has abandoned eir post, another new, Temporary
      Speaker is selected according to the "Rules of Succession", or
      if no such rules are defined, the other Player not on hold with
      the highest Score becomes the temporary Speaker.  This does not
      force the Game to be over in this case, and Scores are not reset
      to 0. The Game continues until a Player Wins, at which time a
      new Game is begun and the Winner becomes the real Speaker. The
      Temporary Speaker shall make reasonable effort to obtain the
      former Speaker's materials: proposal queue, voting records, etc.
      but if this is not possible, then the Temporary Speaker shall
      request that these be resubmitted by the Players. If a Speaker
      is replaced in this manner, e has eir score set to minus 2N
      Points immediately, where N is the number of Points required for
      a Player to Win the Game.

      Abandonment is determined as follows: If any Player suspects
      that the Speaker has Abandoned, e sends a message to all Players
      calling on the Speaker to announce eir presence.  The Speaker
      must reply to all Players within one week; if e does not, e is
      considered to have Abandoned.

      Rulekeepor
      Distributor
      <all other Officers in descending Point order>
      <all other Voters in descending Point order>

      When a replacement Speaker is required, all Players who are
      willing to become Speaker shall indicate such in a message, sent
      within three days of the Abandonment or resignation of the
      Speaker.  The old Speaker may not send such a message.  This
      message shall be sent to the Speaker, in the case of a Speaker
      voluntarily giving up his position; or to the first Player who
      called for the Speaker to announce his presence, in the case of
      an Abandoned Speaker.

      After three days, the Player ranking highest on the list

      interpreted in a certain way, e shall also submit a list of
      Rules relevant to that CFJ, which must include the Rule in
      question.  If the statement is Judged TRUE, the Judge may
      include with the Judgement an Injuction requiring the Rulekeepor
      to annotate the Rule in question with the Statement in the CFJ
      and the list of relevant Rules.

      The annotation shall remain only until one of the Rules
      in the list of relevant Rules is amended, repealed, or
      transmuted; or until a CFJ determines that the injunction no
      longer applies, as described below.  While it remains, it shall
      guide the application of that Rule.

      If a Player believes that the circumstances which led to the
      Judgement no longer prevail and the annotation is therefore no
      longer applicable, e may submit a CFJ to that effect. If it is
      Judged TRUE, the annotation shall be stricken from the rule set.

      end of the three day period, the Electioneer shall randomly
      choose one player from those who indicated a willingness to hold
      the Office, and that Player shall become that Officer.  This

      The Speaker shall enforce this by delaying the distribution of
      Proposals in excess of this number. This Rule takes precedence,

      changed, that quantity is immediately adjusted by rounding to
      the nearest .01 Mark.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which would permit a
      different granularity of Marks.

========================================

Rule 804 (Mutable)
Mandatory Stock Liquidation at End of Game

804.  Liquidation of Stock at End of Game

      At the end of a Game, all Stocks will be returned to the Bank to
      be Auctioned upon the start of a new Game.

      Each Player that owned Stock (as of the end of the old Game)
      will be compensated to the amount of one half of the Marks paid
      by that Player for eis Stocks.  The Marks for a given Stock
      shall be drawn from the account of the Player to which the Stock
      corresponds.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules governing ownership
      of Stocks.

========================================

Rule 805 (Mutable)
Definition of "As Soon As Possible"

805.  Defined Partial Ordering of Actions

      Whenever a Player is required to perform a certain action "as
      soon as possible", e is required to perform this action before
      performing any other actions which have a less strictly defined
      time requirement.  However, email correspondence of a purely
      discussionary nature is excluded from the ordering requirement,
      and may be conducted at any time.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which stipulate a
      less stringent ordering requirement for the performance of these
      actions.

========================================

Rule 806 (Mutable)
Speaker Performs Duties of Vacant Offices

806.  Provide For Vacant Offices

      This Rule applies to Offices in general, and defers to the Rules
      for specific Offices.

========================================

Rule 807 (Mutable)

      results as described in the Rule or Rules that define the form
      of the Proposal in question.

      participating on behalf of the Players of this Nomic
      Game in any Central Nomic Game to be created.

      The Ambassador shall report to the Public Forum once a
      Nomic Week on any new Foreign Policy developements of

      in other Rules.

      Proposals may be submitted directing the Ambassador on
      how to conduct a single piece of Foreign Policy business.

      Instances where a Player breaks this rule are to be ignored by
      said Office or Officer until e receives the message thru means

      purpose of Rule 106 or its successors, such a proposal is

823.  Marks Conversions

      At the end of each game let each Player that did not win have

Response was very good in the Limerick Contest. Thanks to all for
participating. 

Although there is only a cash award for 1st prize, the second and third place
winners are hereby rewarded by the Glory of Public Recognition.


Here is the Third Place Limerick, by Champion Ronald Kunne:

     A frantical Player of Nomic
     Drank in all the Rules like a tonic
        But after more than a year
        He logged off out of fear
     That his boss wouldn't find it so comic


Here is the Second Place Limerick, by First Speaker Michael:

    There was a young man from Ballaratt,
    Everyone knew he was very fat.
    He played too much nomic,
    Engorged his fat stomach,
    And died by eating his hat.


The Grand Prize Winner will be announced shortly.

Chuck has expressed dissatisation with the current configuration of
officeholders, specifically my holding both the Clerk of the Courts
and Speaker positions.

He has further implied/expressed that I cannot be trusted and act 
extralegally by holding both these positions.  As this is beyond
merely submitting a CFJ calling my interpretations of the Ruleset
I shall be resigning as Clerk of the Courts.  I shall not process
any more requests for CFJs as my integrity has been called into
question.  Chuck has answered a direct question from me by private
email and agreed to be the next Clerk of the Courts. Please expect
the transfer within the next 48 hours.

Here is a Proto-Proposal to change the process for Overturning
Judgements.  It still retains some Voting, to give the Voters
some control and to keep the whole thing from happening on
every CFJ.  What do you think?

                 Garth

==========================

Appealing Judgements and the Supreme Justice
(Amends a Rule)

Rule 690 is Amended in its entirety to read:

At any time in the week following the return of a Judgment on a
Call for Judgment, any Player may submit a Proposal that the
Judgment on that Statement be reconsidered.  The Player must
state eis reasoning in the Proposal.

Such a Proposal is automatically Sane.  If it passes, the Clerk
of the Courts shall sit in Judgment on the Statement in eis
capacity as Supreme Justice.  The Supreme Justice shall be in
all ways like a Judge, save that eis decision is final, and
e shall receive twice the compensation that a Judge would for
Judging the same Statement.

Also, I discovered an error in the records transferred from ex-Banker KoJen.
The reward for unanimous proposal 785 had been deducted from the Bank's account
but had not been credited to Chuck.  Chuck should have received 12 points in
interest since 01/24.  Would the scorekeeper please make this correction in
those reports it is still possible to correct.

This score report will take us to the end of 03/02/94.

Previous score report was issued on 02/24/94. I suppose the Scorekeepor broke a

The system administrator at nvg.unit.no (Well, one of them)
has made a /pub/nomic anonymous ftp directory by my request.
I thought it would be nice to have a proper place for hypertext pages
and maybe some other things.

The directory is /pub/nomic at ftp.nvg.unit.no, and for now it is basically
empty.

You asked for it, I thought I'd give it a try.

Let me know any changes you would make, and I'll give them some thought. =)

==================
Proto-Proposal AAA

The Right To Vote
(Creates a Rule)

No Rule may prevent a Player from voting FOR, AGAINST, or
ABSTAIN on a valid Proposal.  This Rule takes precedence
over all rules that specify legal votes with these exceptions:
    1) Rules regarding Voting on Withdrawn Rules.
    2) Rules regarding the Voting Rights of Players On-Hold.

Because of the current transition in Clerk-ship, it may be a while before this
CFJ comes out officially. Rather than keep you all in suspense, I'll give you a
sneak preview.


    *CFJ 120 (David Bowen)

    *Submitted to be Judged:  Tue Mar  1 14:54:57 1994

    *The Judge shall be:  KoJen

    *Statement to be judged:
       The Registrar erred in failing to consider the quantum mechanical
    uncertainties when he performed his Walrus calculations.

    *Rationale for CFJ:
    Explanation: Even the Registrar agrees that in the 10^-100 sec lifetime of
    the Walruses there is an immense uncertainty in the energy present. This
    uncertainty in the energy (10^73 ergs) vastly outweighs the energy of a
    Walrus in ground state (10^28 ergs) that any claim that only a single
    Walrus was created in the interval is ludicrous.  Almost certainly there were
    additional Walrus anti-Walrus pairs created along with more mundane things
    like photons, pi mesons, and top quarks and their corresponding antiparticles.


I accept this appointment to CFJ 120.

I must regretfully judge FALSE, my personal feelings on the Walruses and my
Group affiliations notwithstanding.

Reasoning: A CFJ must first take into account Rules. If the Rules are silent,
then Game Custom. And finally, real-world conventions. The Rules on Walruses
(while they existed) were specific in specifying the nature of Walrus
interactions, and there was no suggestion that they were affected by
quantum-mechanical uncertainties.

One could perhaps claim that the Walrus Rules themselves were inconsistent
because they conflict with the real-world truism of quantum-mechanics, but that
is another CFJ. My duty as judge of this CFJ was to determine if the Registrar
followed the Rules; not whether the Rules should have been followed.

In response to a couple requests, here are all the limericks I received in the
contest, for your amusement:


>From Garth:

There once was an old Nomic Alchemist,
Whose grasp of the Rules did not exist.
	Quoth he, "I'm quite keen
	To Transmute 116,
But can't find the formula in my Almagest!"

There once was a Banker named Bowen,
Who wouldn't pay Marks he was owin'.
	"The Walrus ain't Real!"
	He claimed with great zeal,
"It's Virtual, a Quantum Field flowin'!"

There once was a Player named Tim,
Who recited the Ruleset at whim.
	When asked how to learn,
	All Rules in eir turn,
He said, "Chuck's great new Rulesets, ask him!" 


>From Waggie: (first prize winner)

There once was a Group called PROSIRUP
Who forced all eNomic to gear up
for total confusion,
obstruction, delusion,
and such things designed just to cheer up!


>From Vlad:

To Nomic I am an assistant
To make sure the Rules are consistent.
On all paradox
I say "There a pox!"
It's too bad my goal's so far distant!


>From Oerjan:

There once was a Banker of Nomic
whose story was quite tragicomic;
His brain worked in vain
and grew slowly insane:
It was sure that the Rules were atomic!


>From Dave Bowen:

A limerick has five lines you see
And line four rhymes with line three.
Lines five, one and two
Also rhyme, it is true.
So make your rules limericks, like me.


>From Michael: (second prize winner)

There was a young man from Ballaratt,
Everyone knew he was very fat.
He played too much nomic,
Engorged his fat stomach,
And died by eating his hat.


>From Ronald/Stella:

The old Banker is now keeping score
but recently he asked for folklore
    His mailbox will fill
    'though rhyme is a skill
most Players should better ignore

A limerick packs laughs anatomical
in a space that is quite economical
    But the ones I have seen
    so seldom are clean
And the clean ones so seldom are comical

 There was a young lady named Alice
 who played Nomic out of malice
    When asked why this was so
    She said: Don't even know
 I guess, that not playing more hell is.

====

 One of the Players is Chuck
 To edit the Rules brings him luck
     But he often proclaims
     (without naming names):
 `with too many bad Rules we are stuck'

====

 Waggie is Nomic's main Scamster
 The Walrus was made by this prangster
    For a quantum it was there
    Brought many close to despair
 And even rhyme would prefer here a Hamster

====

 The old Banker is now keeping score
 but recently asked for folklore
     His mailbox will fill
     'though rhyming is a skill
 most Players should better ignore

====

 The vototron allows multiple Votes,
 despite many two-oh-six quotes.
    It helped Waggie to Mark
    (despite a quantum remark)
 with a Walrus a large mass of notes.

====

 Patent Titles need hardly remarks
 Players hunt them as if they were sharks
    A few of us have Titles zero
    No Champ are they, neither Hero,
 nor Marxist, he who marked the most Marks.

====

 A player of mythical name
 died after a life full of fame
    When asked: `To Heaven or Hell?'
    Said he: `Both me go swell,
 just as long as they're playing the Game'

====

 A Speaker a bit tragicomic
 got a number of Rules astronomic
    None of which he resent
    To the bit-bucket all went!
 He prefered to play more auto-nomic.

===
The following are my favourite math and physics limericks:

Steve Weinberg returning from Texas
brings dimensions galore to perplex us.
   But the extra ones all
   are rolled up in a ball
so tiny they never affect us!

A dozen, a gross, and a score
plus 3 times the square root of 4
  divided by seven
  less 2 times eleven
is two squared and not a bit more!

The integral of t squared dt,
>From one to the cube root of three,
When times the cosine
Of three pi over nine
Is the log of the cube root of e.

*** History of the Universe

The Big Bang started the Creation,
in a time when energy was not at ration.
  The Cosmic Egg grew soon
  expanding like a balloon.
The first appearance of Inflation.

Particles fizzed and fused together,
forming baryons, atoms and matter.
  A lot of the stuff was around,
  but not as much as may sound:
fotons did ten-to-the-ninth times better!

Gas clouds condensed and began to burn
hydrogen, helium, carbon in turn.
  A fussy trick to do,
  one we'd like to know too.
But I don't think we'll ever learn.

 A frantical Player of Nomic (third prize winner)
 Drank in all the Rules like a tonic
    But after more than a year
    He logged off out of fear
 That his boss wouldn't find it so comic

====

 There was a young girl named Kay
 Who liked to play Nomic all day
    Thus said her SO:
    `One of us must go'
 She said: `you go! and Nomic shall stay'

====

 Whenever a Rule is submitted
 FOR and AGAINST votes are pitted
    Some Rules have flopped
    But scores we adopt
 Thus a Thousand Rule Ruleset is knitted


>From Chuck:

A student @wisc.edu
Wrote Rule nine hundred and two.
Its precedence clause
had several flaws;
Waggie's new scams filled the Queue.

For those of you who wonder if you have missed anything, here is a list of the
Distributor's uncompressed records.
Those items with OFF: (or OFFIC: in some messages that I wanted to distribute
without trigging the filter) should have been distributed by me.
The others are official and general interest messages collected by me as
Assistant.

In looking through the current ruleset, I found several things that could
be cleaned up a little to make things easier to handle. Here's one of them:

=====
Proto-Proposal IAN-2-A
Declaring Proposals
(Amends a Rule)

Upon the passage of this rule, Rule #454 shall be amended
in the following way:

The following text will be inserted after sentence three of
the first paragraph: "A Player who submits a proposal which
does not include a Declaration, as described here and in
other legislation, shall be guilty of a Class C Crime. Any
Player who submits a proposal which includes a Declaration
that has not been approved by legislation shall be guilty
of a Class A Crime."

[This would combine #454 and #455, making the ruleset easier
to read and more consistent.]

=====
Proto-Proposal IAN-3-A
Repeals unnecessary Rule
(Repeals a Rule)

The previous Rule submitted by the Player who submits this rule, which
amends Rule #454, is, for the purposes of this Rule only, referred to by
the name Fred. If Fred has been adopted, then upon the passage of this
rule, Rule #455 shall be Repealed. If Fred was not adopted, then this rule,
if adopted, shall be considered null and void and shall be removed from the
Rule Set.

[#455 becomes unnecessary if the previous Rule is adopted.]

So, I stopped complaining about the difficulties of Scorekeeping long enough to
finally get around to writing some proposals to do something about the
situation. Please look over and comment on the following suite of proposals. We
really must do something about the situation!


------------------------------------------------------------------------

proto-PROPOSAL aaa 
The Office of Scorekeepor
(amends a rule)

The rule which on 3/19/94 was numbered 493, defining the Office of
Scorekeepor, is to be amended by replacing with the following:

There shall exist an Office known as Scorekeepor. The Scorekeepor is
responsible for maintaining a list of the Point Scores of all current
Players and other Game Entities, making such a list available on
request as well as posting it at least once a Week, and for notifying
Players in the event of a Win on Points. E must abide by all Rules
governing Scoring, but in cases where the Rules are unclear or
contradictory is to use eir best judgement in determining Scores.

The Scorekeepor is chiefly a tabulator of Point changes posted by
others. E is only Legally Responsible for tabulating those classes of
Point changes where Rules specifically bestow Legal Responsibility
upon the Scorekeepor.

[ Justification: Define the Scorekeepor's duties, adding requirement to track
non-Player Entities. Assert that e is primarily a tabulator of Point
changes requested by others, not an individual who is expected to
understand and enforce every obscure Rule on Scoring. ]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

proto-PROPOSAL bbb
Scorekeepor Salary
(creates a rule)

The Salary of the Scorekeepor is 5 Points per Week.

[ Justification: The Scorekeepor's salary is too low for the amount of
work the Office requires; lower than other major Officers. Bring it up
to a competitive level equal to other major Officers. ]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

proto-PROPOSAL ccc
Point Changes Automatically Applied by the Scorekeepor, Part 1
(creates a rule)

Classes of Point changes which the Scorekeepor is Legally Responsible
for detecting and tabulating without a specific request by another
Player include, but are not necessarily limited to the following:

* Salaries which consist of a fixed Point award per Week.

* Transfers of Points specifically requested by the owner of the
Points in a message received by the Scorekeepor.

* Transfers of Points from a Group Treasury specifically requested by
the Vizier of that Group in a message received by the Scorekeepor;
however, the Vizier is legally responsible for ensuring that such a
Point transfer is consistent with eir Group's Ordinances.

* Point changes resulting from end of Game adjustments.

* Point rounding, taxation and "Welfare", if mandated by other Rules.

* Point changes resulting from a Player joining or leaving the Game.

* Point changes resulting from dissolution of a Group.

* Point changes from Stock Dividends.

* Point changes resulting from a premature transfer of Speakership.

The Scorekeepor is Legally Responsible for ensuring that the above Point
changes are performed according to all Rules.

Additional classes of Point changes which are the Scorekeepor's Legal
Responsibility may be defined by other Rules.

[ Justification: Rather than amend many existing Rules to state that
the Scorekeepor is legally responsible for detecting these classes of
Point Changes, this single Rule bestows to the Scorekeepor specific
Legal Responsibility for detecting and applying these classes of Point
changes. ]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

proto-PROPOSAL ddd
No More Auditor
(repeals a rule)

The Rule which on 3/10/94 was numbered 568, defining the Office of
Auditor, is hereby repealed.

[ Justification: We don't need an Auditor. Let all interested Players serve as
amateur Auditors. Why subject two Players to this Agony! ]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

proto-PROPOSAL eee
Point Changes With Legal Responsibility Unspecified
(creates a rule)

If a Rule mandates a change in Points, but no Rules exist which
define the Player Legally Responsible for detecting and reporting
the change to the Scorekeepor, then the Point change is cancelled.

This Rule takes precedence over all other Rules governing changes in
Points, to the extent permitted.

[ Justification: Ensure that in the future, Rules will not be written
which stipulate a Point change but do not specify who is to detect
it. This should make everyone think before proposing: Is this too much
work? Who is going to do it?

Existing Rules are all covered by the specfic instances in the
Proposals "Point Changes Automatically Applied By the Scorekeepor,
Part 1", and "Point Changes Requested By Other Players, Part 1". New
Rules will need to specifically define who is Legally Responsible, or
they are effectively cancelled. ]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

proto-PROPOSAL fff
Point Changes Requested By Other Players, Part 1
(creates a rule)

The Legal Responsibility for detecting the following classes of Point
changes and reporting them to the Scorekeepor is bestowed upon another
Player:

* All Point changes directly related to the submission of Proposals:
responsibility of Speaker, who must report these no later than the
message announcing the voting results.

* All Point changes directly related to voting on Proposals:
responsibility of Speaker, who must report these no later than the
message announcing the voting results.

* All point changes resulting from Vototron contributions:
responsibility of Speaker, who must report these no later than the
message announcing the voting results.

* All point changes resulting from fees for judgements, salaries and
penalties given to judges: responsibility of Clerk of the Courts, who
must report these as soon as possible, and no later than the message
announcing the outcome of the judgement.

* Electioneer per-position-filled salary: responsibility of
Electioneer to notify Scorekeepor within one Week.

* Point changes regarding the "Squealer/Ninny" Rule: If the Ninny must
lose Points, the responsibility lies with the Squealer for informing
the Scorekeepor as soon as possible.

* Marks interest: responsibility of Banker to nofify Scorekeepor as soon as
possible following the mandated interst payment.

* Proposal lottery: responsibility of Sweepstakes Officer, who must
notify Scorekeepor as soon as possible after the drawing.

* Ambassador salary: responsibility of Ambassador for notifying
Scorekeepor no later than one Week following the time the payment is earned.

Other classes of Point changes whose legal responsibilty for reporting
is other than the Scorekeepor may be defined by other Rules.

[ Justification: Rather than amend many existing Rules to state who is
legally responsible for the many classes of Point changes, this single
Rule does this for several classes of Point Changes. ]
