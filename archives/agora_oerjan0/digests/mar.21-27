Chess Nomic found:

I located on the Internet a Nomiclike game called Chess Nomic and
claim the five Points from Proposal 861, to be transfered from
the Ambassador to me.

The Chess Nomic Rule Set is:

Immutables:

101) The Players of Chess Nomic are KoJen and Stella?

Mutables:

201) Initially all Rules of Regular Chess apply with the exception
that a Turn consists either of a Move, or the change of a Regular Chess
Rule.

301) Let there be a Piece called the Joker, that at any time, combines
the moves of the Knight and the Queen.

I located a Nomic-like Game on the Internet. I claim 5 Points from Rule 861, to
be transferred from the Ambassador to me.

I am sure that you will find this Game as interesting as I have. It is based on
"20 Questions". 

Here are the Rules:


Immutable Rules:

100: All Players must abide by all Rules in effect.

101: The Players are Ronald Kunne and David Cogen.

102: Immutable Rules may be changed by unanimous consent of all Players.

Mutable Rules:

201: This Game is played like 20 questions, with one exception: Instead of
asking a question, a Player may propose a new Rule, or a Rule Change. Such
proposals are adopted by at least half of all Players.

202: The first Chooser is David Cogen, and all other Players are Guessers.

203: When one of the Guessers correctly guesses the word, e becomes the new
Chooser, and the old Chooser becomes the Guesser.

I have located another Nomic-like Game being played  on the Internet. It is
a Game of Rule Changes and Joke Telling. Here is the current Rule Set:


100: All Players must abide by all Rules in effect.
101: The Initial Players are Ronadl Kunne and David Cogen
102: Immutable Rules may be changed by unanimous consent of all Players.

Mutable Rules:

200: Any Player may distribute a joke to all Players at any time.

201: Every Monday, all Players shall decide which was the best joke in the
preceeding week. The Player who proposed the best joke shall receive 97.1
Points. 

201.5: The decision of the best joke must be unanimous. If no agreement is
reached by Thursday of the same Week, there is no winner for that week.

202: Mutable Rules may be changed at any time, only by the Player who sent the
best joke in the previous week may change rules in the current week.

203: When a Player achieves 591 Points, Rules 201 and 201.5 are replaced with
two Rules of that Player's choice.


I claim 5 Points from Garth for locating this Game.

KoJen and I started two more games, which I have the honour to
announce. (Makes 25 Points in total. Mr Scorekeepor, please take
note!)

Don't worry, Mr Ambassador, I sent a proposal to the Speaker to
cure this dreadful hole in 861.

====
RCA-Nomic found:

I located on the Internet a Nomiclike game called RCA Nomic and
claim the five Points from Proposal 861, to be transfered from
the Ambassador to me.

The RCA Nomic Rule Set is:

What say we Play the following Nomic-like Game?

RCA-Nomic:
100: All Players must abide by all Rules in effect.
101: The Initial Players are Ronald Kunne and David Cogen
102: Immutable Rules may be changed by unanimous consent of all Players.

Mutable Rules:

200: Any Player has to read rec.games.abstract at least once a week.

201: Any game found on rec.games.abstract not announced before
to the other Players scores 5 Points.

202: Any game found on rec.games.abstract may be improved upon by
a Proposal proposing so. Adoption of such a Proposal by a simple
majority of all Players gives the right to start a Flame War on
rec.games.abstract.

====
Scrabble Nomic found:

I located on the Internet a Nomiclike game called Scrabble Nomic and
claim the five Points from Proposal 861, to be transfered from
the Ambassador to me.

The Scrabble Nomic Rule Set is:

Immutables:

101) The Players of Scrabble Nomic are KoJen and Stella?

Mutables:

201) Initially all Rules of Regular Scrabble apply with the exception
that a Turn consists either of a Move, or the change of a Regular Scrabble
Rule.

301) The usual two-dimensional board is replaced by one that has
4x4x4x4 squares.

302) Words longer than four letters gain a Bonus of 50 Points, but
may not be placed on the board

303) The first player with a headache, looses all eis Points.

Greetings,
Stella?

I have located another Nomic-like Game being played on the Internet.

This Game is fascinating, because it is closely tied with the "yoyo", or
"Agora", or "Leviathan", or whatever we're calling our Game. Look at these
Rules: 


Anti-Yoyo-Nomic

Immutable Rules

1: The initial Rules are this Rule and the following, plus all the Rules used
by the Yoyo Nomic as of March 21, 1992.

2: Initial Players are David Cogen and Ronald Kunne.

3: Players may not propose Rules. This Rule takes precedence over all other
Rules. 

4: Rule changes are made as follows: Whenever a yoyo Nomic Proposal fails, it
is added to the Rule Set. Whenever a yoyo Nomic Proposal passes, it is not
added to the Rule Set.

5: Initial Speaker is David Cogen.

6: Initial holder of all Offices is Ronald Kunne.


You all may find this Game particularly noteworthy, bacause it is open to
anyone immediately, simply by sending a message to our Registrar, Ronald Kunne.


I claim 5 Points for locating this Nomic-like Game.

I have located another Nomic-like Game being Played on the Internet.

I like this Game, because it has some possibility to improve World Peace and
Prosperity. It has the drawback of requiring all Rule changes to be approved by
a leader of a recognized national governing body, so I expect it to move rather
slowly. 

I claim 5 Points for locating this Game before the Ambassador.


Immutable Rules:

101: All Players must always abide by all Rules in effect.

102: Initial Players are David Cogen and Ronald Kunne.

103: Any Player may propose a Rule change by sending the proposal to the
highest government official in the national governing body of a country
recognized by the United Nations.  This proposal must be accompanied by a
suggestion which, if adopted by that country's government, would contribute to
the peace and prosperity of that country. The Proposal becomes a Rule if and
when the government official sends a message, on official government
stationary, stating that the Proposal is a good addition to the Game.

104: No proposals shall be sent until unanimous consent is given by all current
Players.

THE CURRENT RULESET
Part 1 of 5 

Rules are listed as follows, where NNN represents the Rule number:

========================================

Rule NNN (Immutable or Mutable)
My Own Unofficial Title

NNN.  Semi-Official Rule Title, If There Is One

      Text of Rule

[Note:  I have annotated some Rules to clarify their interpretation.
However, these annotations have no legal force in and of themselves.]

========================================



========================================

Rule 101 (Immutable)
Obey the Rules

101.

      All Players must always abide by all the Rules then in effect,
      in the form in which they are then in effect.  The Rules in the
      Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the first game.
      The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (Immutable) and
      201-219 (Mutable).

========================================

Rule 102 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Rules

102.

      Initially Rules in the 100's are Immutable and Rules in the
      200's are Mutable.  Rules subsequently Enacted or Transmuted
      (that is, changed from Immutable to Mutable or vice versa) may
      be Immutable or Mutable regardless of their Numbers, and Rules
      in the Initial Set may be Transmuted regardless of their Numbers.

========================================

Rule 103 (Immutable)
The Speaker and Voters

103.

      At any time, each Player shall be either a Voter or the Speaker;
      no Player may simultaneously be a Voter and a Speaker. At any
      time, there shall be exactly one Speaker. The term "Player" in
      the Rules shall specifically include both the Voters and the
      Speaker.

========================================

Rule 104 (Immutable)
First Speaker

104.

      The Speaker for the first game shall be Michael Norrish.

========================================

Rule 105 (Immutable)
What Is a Rule Change?

105.

      A Rule Change is any of the following:  (1) the enactment,
      repeal, or amendment of a mutable Rule; or (2) the transmutation
      of an immutable Rule into a mutable Rule or vice versa.
        (Note:  This definition implies that, at least initially, all
      new Rules are Mutable; Immutable Rules, as long as they are
      Immutable, may not be Amended or Repealed; Mutable Rules, as long
      as they are Mutable, may be Amended or Repealed; any Rule of any
      status may be Transmuted; no Rule is absolutely immune to change.)

========================================

Rule 106 (Immutable)
Adopting Proposed Rule Changes

106.

      All Rule Changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on.
      They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required
      number of votes and Quorum is achieved.

========================================

Rule 107 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Must Be Written Down

107.

      Any proposed Rule Change must be written down (or otherwise
      communicated in print media) before it is voted on. If adopted,
      it must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.

========================================

Rule 108 (Immutable)
When May Rule Changes Take Effect?

108.

      No Rule Change may take effect earlier than the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording
      explicitly states otherwise.  No rule change may have retroactive
      application.

========================================

Rule 109 (Immutable)
Rule Numbers

109.

      The Speaker shall give each proposed Rule Change a Number for
      reference.  The numbers shall begin with 301, and each Rule
      Change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next
      successive integer, whether or not the Proposal is adopted.
        If a Rule is Repealed and Reenacted, it receives the Number of
      the Proposal to Reenact it.  If a Rule is Amended or Transmuted,
      it receives the Number of the Proposal to Amend or Transmute it.
 
========================================

Rule 110 (Immutable)
Transmutation of Rules

110.

      Rule Changes that Transmute Immutable Rules into Mutable Rules
      may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among Votes
      legally cast.  Transmutation shall not be implied, but must be
      stated explicitly in a Proposal to take effect.
 
========================================

Rule 111 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Conflicts

111.

      In a conflict between a Mutable and an Immutable Rule, the
      immutable Rule takes precedence and the Mutable Rule shall be
      entirely void.  For the purposes of this Rule a Proposal to
      Transmute an Immutable Rule does not "conflict" with that
      Immutable Rule.
 
========================================

Rule 112 (Immutable)
Winning Must Be by Points

112.

      The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered
      from achieving n points to any other state of affairs.  The
      magnitude of n and the means of earning points may be changed,
      and Rules that establish a Winner when play cannot continue may
      be Enacted and (while they are mutable) be Amended or Repealed.
 
========================================

Rule 113 (Immutable)
Players May Always Forfeit

113.

      A Player always has the option to forfeit the Game rather than
      continue to play or incur a Game penalty.  No penalty worse than
      losing, in the judgment of the Player to incur it, may be
      imposed.

========================================

Rule 114 (Immutable)
At Least One Mutable Rule

114.

      There must always be at least one Mutable Rule.  The adoption of
      Rule Changes must never become completely inpermissible.

========================================

Rule 115 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Which Change Rule-Changing Rules Allowed

115.

      Rule Changes that affect Rules needed to allow or apply
      Rule Changes are as permissible as other Rule Changes.  Even
      Rule Changes that amend or repeal their own authority are
      permissible.  No Rule Change or type of move is impermissible
      solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a
      Rule.

========================================

Rule 116 (Immutable)
Permissibility of the Unprohibited

116.

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
      and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
      which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly or
      implicitly permits it.

========================================

Rule 201 (Mutable)
Quorum

201.

      Quorum for a proposed Rule Change is defined to be 20% of Voters
      at the beginning of the prescribed Voting Period for that
      Proposal.

========================================

Rule 206 (Mutable)
One Voter, One Vote

206.

      Each Voter has exactly one Vote.  The Speaker may not Vote.

========================================

Rule 208 (Mutable)
End of the Voting Period

208.

      At the end of the prescribed Voting Period on a Proposal, the
      Speaker shall reveal all Votes legally cast on that Proposal. If
      the Speaker's consent may be required for a Proposal to be
      adopted then the Speaker should indicate at that time whether or
      not e gives eir consent.  If the Speaker does not explicitly
      indicate that e refuses to consent to the Proposal, it shall be
      assumed that e consents.

========================================

Rule 212 (Mutable)
Resolving Rule Conflicts

212.

      If two or more Mutable Rules conflict with one another, or if
      two or more Immutable Rules conflict with one another, then the
      Rule with the lowest ordinal Number takes precedence.
        If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of rule) or takes
      precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.
        If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

========================================

Rule 217 (Mutable)
Judgements Must Accord with the Rules

217.

      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however, if
      the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the Statement
      to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider Game Custom and the
      Spirit of the Game before applying other standards.

========================================

Rule 312 (Mutable)
A Point for Voting

312.

      If a Voter votes, he gets one (1) point at the end of the Voting
      Period.

========================================

Rule 376 (Mutable)
When Does a Rule Change Take Effect?

376.  Time that a rule change takes effect:

      An adopted rule change takes full effect at the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it.
      The moment of the completion of the vote is defined by the date
      and time given in the line starting with "Date:" of the Nomic
      listserver message send by the Benevolent Speaker, announcing
      the result of the vote on the corresponding proposal.

========================================

Rule 388 (Mutable)
Game Status When a New Game Begins

388.  Starting a new Game:

      Whenever a new game of Nomic is begun, the status of the new
      Game when it begins shall be the same as the status of the old
      Game when it ended, in all respects where the Rules do not
      decide otherwise.

========================================

Rule 399 (Mutable)
The Office of the Rulekeepor

399.  The Office of the Rulekeepor:

      Let there be an Officer known as the Rulekeepor.
      The Rulekeepor shall maintain a complete list of the current
      Rules, and post this list to all Players at least once a week.
      
      So long as the Rulekeepor is in Office, the Speaker is not
      required to maintain or distribute the Rules.

========================================

Rule 402 (Mutable)
Transfer of Power of the Mighty Speaker

402.  Transfer of Power of the Mighty Speaker:

      When one Mighty Speaker is yielding his Office to another, the
      following procedure shall be followed:
      
       1) The Present Mighty Speaker shall forward copies of all
          necessary materials for the performance of his Office to the
          Prospective Mighty Speaker.
       2) The Prospective Mighty Speaker shall acknowledge the receipt
          of said materials.
       3) The Present Mighty Speaker shall post a message to the
          listserv announcing the official transfer of power, which
          occurs at the "Date:" of the Present Mighty Speaker's
          posting.
      
      The Present Mighty Speaker remains in Office until the successful
      completion of step 3.

========================================

Rule 404 (Mutable)
Legality of Proposals

404.  Legality of Proposals:

      As long as a Proposal satisfies all requirements in place at the
      time of its making for the proper making of Proposals, the act
      of making such a Proposal is legal regardless of its content.
      It is legal to propose a Rule which conflicts with other Rules
      or with itself, which is paradoxical, or which cannot be
      applied.

========================================

Rule 405 (Mutable)
No Vacations for Officers

405.  No Vacations for Officers:

      No Officer may be 'On Hold' while holding an Office.  If a
      current Officer should place himself On Hold, he is assumed to
      have resigned without appointing a successor, and the Office
      should be re-filled in the normal manner.  This Rule takes
      precedence over Rule 386.

========================================

Rule 406 (Mutable)
Clerk of the Courts

406.  Clerk of the Courts, Part I: Definition of Office:

      There shall exist an Office "Clerk of the Courts", who shall
      have general responsibility over administering Calls for
      Judgement, as outlined in the Rules.  The active Clerk of the
      Court may never be selected as a Judge.

      As a salary for carrying out his duties, he will receive 5
      points at the end of every seven days he is in Office, counting
      from his assumption of the Office.

      The initial holder of this Office shall be the Player who
      submitted this Proposal.

========================================

Rule 407 (Mutable)
Invoking Judgement

407.  Clerk of the Courts, Part II: Invoking Judgement:

      If Players disagree about the legality of a Move or the
      interpretation or application of a Rule, then a Player may
      invoke Judgement by submitting a Statement for Judgement to the
      Clerk of the Courts.  Disagreement, for the purposes of this
      Rule, may be created by the insistence of any Player.  When
      Judgement is invoked, the Clerk of the Courts must, as soon as
      possible, select a Judge as described in the Rules.  The Clerk
      of the Courts must then distribute the Statement to be judged,
      along with the identity of the Judge, to all Players.

========================================

Rule 408 (Mutable)
Accepting Judge-ship

408.  Clerk of the Courts, Part III: Accepting Judge-ship:

      After the Clerk of the Courts has distributed the Statement to
      be judged and the identity of the Judge, the Judge has one week
      in which to deliver a legal Judgement.  If the Judge fails to
      deliver a Judgement within this time, e is penalized 10 points
      and a new Judge is selected.  A Judgement is delivered by
      submitting that Judgement to the Clerk of the Courts, who must
      then distribute that Judgement to all Players as soon as
      possible.

========================================

Rule 413 (Mutable)
Winning by Paradox

413.  Winning By Paradox:

      If the Rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or
      if the legality of some action cannot be determined with
      finality, or if some action appears equally legal and illegal,
      then a player may Call For Judgement on a Statement to that
      effect.  If the Statement is judged TRUE, then the same Judge
      who judged the Statement TRUE must declare the most recent
      passed Proposal X such that the Statement was not TRUE before
      the passage of Proposal X, or declare that there is no such
      Proposal.  (Until the Judge does this, the Judgment is not
      valid.)  If the Judgement of TRUE is not overruled, then the
      Player who called for Judgement is declared the Winner of the
      game.
      
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared that
      there is no such Proposal X, the game is ended, with no
      provisions for restarting it.
      
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared such
      a Proposal X, the following actions are taken:
         - all Players remain active,
         - all Proposals curently being Voted upon are removed from
           consideration for Voting,
         - the scores for all Players are set to 0 (zero),
         - the Rules and explicit game custom are reverted to the
           state they were in before Proposal X was passed,
         - a Benevolent Speaker for the next Game is chosen:
              -If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the
               Benevolent Speaker, and the old Benevolent Speaker
               becomes a Voter,
              -If there is more than one Winner, the Benevolent
               Speaker randomly selects one of the Winners, who
               becomes the new Benevolent Speaker, and the old
               Benevolent Speaker becomes a Voter,
         - and a new Game is begun.

========================================

Rule 415 (Mutable)
How To Submit a Proposal

415.  "How a Proposal is Submitted":

      A Proposal by a Voter shall be made by submitting it to the

Rule 417 (Mutable)
The Nomic Archivist

417.  Establishment of the Office of Archivist:

      That there be established an office known as the Nomic
      Archivist, which shall be governed by the default Rules
      concerning official posts. The initial duties of the Nomic
      Archivist shall be to record the passage and failure of
      Proposals, to maintain a "historical record" (defined below)
      of the Ruleset, to maintain a list of Judgements and their case
      histories, and to maintain a list of game Winners in past games.
      The Archivist is free to comment on the historical records as
      they see fit, but such commentary must be clearly delimited
      from the historical material. Where the material being stored
      does not already admit a classification method, the Archivist
      is free to design one themselves.

      The "historical record" of the Ruleset maintained by the
      Archivist is one that includes all rules ever part of the nomic
      Ruleset, annotated with information as to their ultimate fate,
      whether Repealed or Amended etc. This record of the Ruleset has
      no legal force.

      The duties required of the Archivist may be changed with their
      consent and at the request of the Office's controlling body
      (whatsoever that may be). Initially, the controlling body of
      this Office shall be all Players, and any request to change the
      duties must therefore be supported by a majority of Players
      "speaking" to the request.  Naturally, default Rules for
      Offices may establish a different controlling body for this
      Office.
      
      The salary of the Archivist office shall be determined by its
      controlling body. Initially, its salary shall be 5 points and
      one coin of the office-holder's group per week.
      
      The initial office-holder for this post shall be Michael
      Norrish.

========================================

Rule 434 (Mutable)
Game May Be Won By CFJ

434.  Judgement Required to Win (and Timing of Win):

      If a Player believes that he has won the Game, he may submit a
      CFJ to that effect.  If it is returned with the Judgement TRUE
      (and that Judgement is not Appealed), then he has won the Game
      as of the delivery of that Judgement.  If the Judgement is TRUE,
      but is Appealed, but is sustained (and no Proposal to reverse
      the verdict is made), then he has won the Game as of the
      delivery of the Appeal verdict.  If such a verdict is sustained,
      challenged by Proposal, but the Proposal does not pass, he has
      won the Game as of the completion of the Vote on that Proposal.

      Judgement on a CFJ to win the Game may *not* be delivered until
      at least 72 hours after its official announcement, in order to
      give time for the Judge to accept input from the community.

      This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which specifies
      the exact moment at which a Game is won.

[Note: Implicit Game Custom dictates that, despite the title,
this rule does not *require* a CFJ in order to win the game.]

========================================

Rule 450 (Mutable)
Game Entities May Not Be Arbitrarily Changed

450.  Game Entities may not be Arbitrarily Changed:

      Any Entity which is created by the Nomic Rules, and which exists only
      within the context of the current Game of Nomic, such as Points,
      Votes, etc. may *not* be changed by any action other than those
      specified by the Rules.

========================================

Rule 451 (Mutable)
Determination of Judgement--Timing

451.  Timing of CFJ Results:

      When a CFJ makes a Statement about the current state of the
      Game, the result of that CFJ shall be TRUE if and only if the
      Judge feels that that Statement was correct at the time that the
      CFJ was *issued*. Any changes that have happened in the time
      between the issuing of the CFJ and its delivery must be figured
      in to find the correct current state.

========================================

Rule 452 (Mutable)
Prohibition of Electioneering by the Mighty Speaker

452.  Prohibition of Electioneering by the Mighty Speaker:

      The Speaker may not use eis knowledge of the current status of a

      Vote on that Proposal. Violations of this Rule shall be
      considered a Class C Crime.

========================================

Rule 454 (Mutable)
Declaring Proposals

454.  Clarity of Proposals:

      All Proposals must declare what effect that Proposal will have
      on the Rule Set. If said Proposal has a Title, this Declaration
      shall appear on the line immediately below that Title. In any
      case, the Declaration shall appear in parentheses. The
      Declarations shall be as follows:

         (Creates a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes a new
            Rule to come into existance.
         (Amends a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes an
            existing Rule to change wording or form.
         (Repeals a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes an
            existing Rule to cease to exist.
         (Transmutes a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes a
            Mutable Rule to become Immutable, or vice versa.
         (Other) shall be used if no other Declaration has been
            defined which describes the Proposal.

      Additional legislation may define additional legal Declarations
      or change the presentation of the Declaration, but this Rule
      shall take precedence in all other cases.

610.  Default Rules for Currencies I: What is a Currency?

      Marks and Coins are Currencies.  Each type of Coin is a separate

      entity may own Currencies except as provided for in the Rules.
      The number of each type of Currency owned by each player or
      other Nomic entity must be non-negative, and must be an integer.

      This rule applies to Currencies in general, and thus defers to
      rules for specific Currencies.

      The Recordkeepor for each type of Coin shall be the Vizier of
      the Group corresponding to that type of Coin.

               a Currency
            b) a player may not transfer more of a Currency than e
               currently has.

      This rule applies to Currencies in general, and thus defers to
      rules for specific Currencies.

      If a Proposal seeks to Amend or Repeal a Rule, that Proposal
      must refer to that Rule either by that Rule's number or by its
      Title as given in the latest distributed Current Rule Set.
      If a Proposal seeks to Amend a Rule, that Proposal must

      must restate the entire Rule, or the Proposal must quote the
      phrases or words to be deleted (if any) and the phrases or words
      to be inserted (as well as the location of such insertion) or

      the Proposal fails, that person may not be nominated for the
      same Patent Title for a period of 4 weeks.  If the Rule which
      creates the Patent Title specifies another method of assigning
      the Patent Title, then that Rule shall take precedence over
      this Rule. The Registrar shall keep track of all Patent Titles
      which have been granted.

Allowed CFJ's

662.  Liberalize Restrictions on Judgements

      A "Move" refers to any specific action taken by a Player or
      group of Players in the context of the game. Any invocation of
      Judgement must satisfy one or more of the following conditions:

          - clearly allege that a specific Move is illegal;
          - clearly allege that a specific Rule is illegal or lacking
            in legal force, in whole or in part;
          - clearly allege that a specific Rule ought to be
            interpreted in a certain way.
          - clearly allege that the current published game state is
            incorrect, and in what respects.

      A CFJ which does not satisfy at least one of the above
      conditions shall be deemed invalid and shall not be accepted for
      Judgement by the Clerk of the Courts. However, this Rule shall
      defer to rules which explictly permit CFJs that do not
      necessarily meet the above conditions.

========================================

Rule 663 (Mutable)
Injunctions--General

663.  General Rules For Injunctions

      There shall be an entity known as an Injunction, which may
      accompany certain Judgements of TRUE or FALSE as provided in the
      rules. An Injunction is a statement or series of statements
      specifying an action or actions which must take place. If a
      Judgement is is accompanied by an Injunction, that Injunction
      must be published with the Judgement. All players must abide by
      the Injunction beginning no later than 72 hours after its
      publication unless one of the following conditions then apply:
        - The Judgement which the Injunction accompanies is undergoing
          appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of the appeal
          process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but a proposal
          has been published which would overturn that decision if
          passed, and said proposal has not failed.
        - The validity of the Injunction itself is questioned by a
          pending CFJ.
        - A Judgement upholding the validity of the Injunction is
          undergoing appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of
          the appeal process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but
          a proposal has been published which would overturn that
          decision if passed, and said proposal has not failed.

      A Judgement may not be accompanied by an Injunction unless it is
      specifically permitted elsewhere in the rules. An Injunction
      must be completely consistent with all rules in effect at the
      time of issuance, and must be completely relevant to the matter
      addressed in the corresponding judgement.

      If any Player believes that an Injunction or any part of it does
      not meet the criteria for a valid Injunction, e may submit a CFJ
      to that effect. If the resulting Judgement supports the
      contention that the criteria are not met, the Injunction shall
      be considered illegal and shall have no legal force.

      This rule takes precedence over all rules governing Injunctions.

========================================

Rule 664 (Mutable)
Illegal Injuctions are Crimes

Injuction--Retracting an Illegal Move

665.  Specific Injunctions, part I

      Judgement supports the allegation, the Judge may include with
      the Judgement an Injunction specifying that the move is to be
      retracted, and any resulting adjustments to the published game
      state. The adjustments to the game state must have been
      unambiguously specified within the CFJ, and these adjustments
      must only undo actions which were a direct or indirect result of
      that Move.

========================================

Rule 669 (Mutable)
To Disobey an Injunction is Criminal

669.  Contempt of Court

      If the rules require a Player to obey an Injunction and e fails
      to do so, then a Criminal Court may find that Player GUILTY of a

      recent Clerk of the Courts. A tentative replacement shall be
      asked if e wants the Office, and if not, a new one shall be
      selected in the same manner.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which may seem to
      require the Clerk of the Courts to fill a vacant Office of Clerk
      of the Courts.

THE CURRENT RULESET
Part 3 of 5 

========================================

Rule 610 (Mutable)
Default Rules for Currencies I: What is a Currency?

610.  Default Rules for Currencies I: What is a Currency?

      Marks and Coins are Currencies.  Each type of Coin is a separate
      Currency.  Other rules may define other Currencies, but nothing
      is a Currency unless explicitly defined as such by a rule.

========================================

Rule 611 (Mutable)
Default Rules for Currencies II: Who May Own How Many Currencies

611.  Default Rules for Currencies II: Who May Own How Many Currencies

      Players may own any type of Currency.  No non-player Nomic
      entity may own Currencies except as provided for in the Rules.
      The number of each type of Currency owned by each player or
      other Nomic entity must be non-negative, and must be an integer.

      This rule applies to Currencies in general, and thus defers to
      rules for specific Currencies.

========================================

Rule 612 (Mutable)
Default Rules for Currencies III: Recordkeepors for Currencies

612.  Default Rules for Currencies III: Recordkeepors for Currencies

      A Player is defined as the Recordkeepor for a Currency if e is
      required to keep an accurate record of the number of that
      Currency owned by each player and non-player Nomic entity which
      is permitted to own that Currency.

      The Recordkeepor for each type of Coin shall be the Vizier of
      the Group corresponding to that type of Coin.

      Other rules may establish Recordkeepors for other Currencies.

========================================

Rule 613 (Mutable)
Default Rules for Currencies IV: Default Recordkeepors

613.  Default Rules for Currencies IV: Default Recordkeepors

      If a Currency exists and no rule (other than this one) exists
      which specifies a Recordkeepor for that Currency, then the
      Banker shall be the Recordkeepor for that Currency.

      This rule applies to Currencies in general, and thus defers to
      rules for specific Currencies.

========================================

Rule 614 (Mutable)
Default Rules for Currencies V: Transferring Currencies

614.  Default Rules for Currencies V: Transferring Currencies

      A player may voluntarily transfer any Currency to any other
      player for any purpose by sending such a message to the
      Recordkeepor for that Currency, within the following limits:

            a) a player may only transfer a positive number of
               a Currency
            b) a player may not transfer more of a Currency than e
               currently has.

      This rule applies to Currencies in general, and thus defers to
      rules for specific Currencies.

========================================

Rule 627 (Mutable)
Bank Now Has 20 Marks

627.  Initial Capital for the Bank

      Upon passage of this Rule 20 Marks will be created as

628.  The Point Reserve

      Let there be a quantity of Points known as the Point Reserve.

      Any action which causes Points to be taken from any Entity, but
      does not specify where these Points are to be given, shall give
      these Points to the Point Reserve.

      The Scorekeepor shall keep score of the number of Points in
      the Point Reserve.
      On adoption of this Rule, the Point Reserve will contain 100
      Points.

[Note: This was passed some time ago.  While I'm not sure
exactly when it was, I believe it was in October 1993.]

      If a Proposal seeks to Amend or Repeal a Rule, that Proposal
      must refer to that Rule either by that Rule's number or by its
      Title as given in the latest distributed Current Rule Set.
      If a Proposal seeks to Amend a Rule, that Proposal must
      explicitly state how in one of two ways: Either the Proposal
      must restate the entire Rule, or the Proposal must quote the
      phrases or words to be deleted (if any) and the phrases or words
      to be inserted (as well as the location of such insertion) or

      question shall be known to all Players by that Patent Title. If
      the Proposal fails, that person may not be nominated for the
      same Patent Title for a period of 4 weeks.  If the Rule which
      creates the Patent Title specifies another method of assigning
      the Patent Title, then that Rule shall take precedence over
      this Rule. The Registrar shall keep track of all Patent Titles
      which have been granted.

Rule 662 (Mutable)
Allowed CFJ's

662.  Liberalize Restrictions on Judgements

      A "Move" refers to any specific action taken by a Player or
      group of Players in the context of the game. Any invocation of
      Judgement must satisfy one or more of the following conditions:

          - clearly allege that a specific Move is illegal;
          - clearly allege that a specific Rule is illegal or lacking
            in legal force, in whole or in part;
          - clearly allege that a specific Rule ought to be
            interpreted in a certain way.
          - clearly allege that the current published game state is
            incorrect, and in what respects.

      A CFJ which does not satisfy at least one of the above
      conditions shall be deemed invalid and shall not be accepted for
      Judgement by the Clerk of the Courts. However, this Rule shall
      defer to rules which explictly permit CFJs that do not
      necessarily meet the above conditions.

========================================

Rule 663 (Mutable)
Injunctions--General

663.  General Rules For Injunctions

      There shall be an entity known as an Injunction, which may
      accompany certain Judgements of TRUE or FALSE as provided in the
      rules. An Injunction is a statement or series of statements
      specifying an action or actions which must take place. If a
      Judgement is is accompanied by an Injunction, that Injunction
      must be published with the Judgement. All players must abide by
      the Injunction beginning no later than 72 hours after its
      publication unless one of the following conditions then apply:
        - The Judgement which the Injunction accompanies is undergoing
          appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of the appeal
          process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but a proposal
          has been published which would overturn that decision if
          passed, and said proposal has not failed.
        - The validity of the Injunction itself is questioned by a
          pending CFJ.
        - A Judgement upholding the validity of the Injunction is
          undergoing appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of
          the appeal process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but
          a proposal has been published which would overturn that
          decision if passed, and said proposal has not failed.

      A Judgement may not be accompanied by an Injunction unless it is
      specifically permitted elsewhere in the rules. An Injunction
      must be completely consistent with all rules in effect at the
      time of issuance, and must be completely relevant to the matter
      addressed in the corresponding judgement.

      If any Player believes that an Injunction or any part of it does
      not meet the criteria for a valid Injunction, e may submit a CFJ
      to that effect. If the resulting Judgement supports the
      contention that the criteria are not met, the Injunction shall
      be considered illegal and shall have no legal force.

      This rule takes precedence over all rules governing Injunctions.

========================================

Rule 664 (Mutable)
Illegal Injuctions are Crimes

664.  Judicial Accountability

      If a Judge hands down an Injunction which is determined illegal
      by a CFJ, then a Criminal Court may find em GUILTY of a Class C

========================================

Rule 665 (Mutable)
Injuction--Retracting an Illegal Move

665.  Specific Injunctions, part I

      If a CFJ alleges that a specific Move is illegal, and the
      Judgement supports the allegation, the Judge may include with
      the Judgement an Injunction specifying that the move is to be
      retracted, and any resulting adjustments to the published game
      state. The adjustments to the game state must have been
      unambiguously specified within the CFJ, and these adjustments
      must only undo actions which were a direct or indirect result of
      that Move.

========================================

Rule 669 (Mutable)
To Disobey an Injunction is Criminal

669.  Contempt of Court

      If the rules require a Player to obey an Injunction and e fails
      to do so, then a Criminal Court may find that Player GUILTY of a
      Class C crime.

      recent Clerk of the Courts. A tentative replacement shall be
      asked if e wants the Office, and if not, a new one shall be
      selected in the same manner.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which may seem to
      require the Clerk of the Courts to fill a vacant Office of Clerk
      of the Courts.

        - If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the new
          Speaker and the old Speaker becomes a Voter.
        - If there is more than one Winner, the Voter with the highest Point 
          total becomes the new Speaker.  If more than one Voter is
          tied for the highest score, the old Speaker randomly selects
          one of them to become the new Speaker.  The old Speaker
          becomes a voter.
        - All Player's scores are reset to 0.
        - A new Game is begun.  All Rules and Proposals retain the
          status they had at the end of the old Game.

Rule 725 (Mutable)
Stocks

725.  Timing of Stock point transfer.

      Let there be for each Player one Currency called X Stock,
      where X is the name of the Player.

      On Friday Noon GMT 5% of the Points of Player X (with a minimum
      of two Points) shall be transfered to the Player (or Players)
      who holds Stock X.

      At the passing of this Proposal the Bank has possession of all
      Stocks.  During the following week the Banker shall collect the
      bids in Marks.  Those bids have to be made by the Players
      (either alone or acting together on the same Stock) in a message
      to the server.  No bid shall be made, which can not be covered
      by the Marks in  he bidders Bank account (to be verified by the
      Banker.)

      After one week each of the Stocks shall be transfered from the
      Bank to the highest bidder. If two or more bids for Stock X are
      exactly equal, the Stock shall go to player X (if one of the
      highest bidders), or to the Player with the lowest score.

      If a given Stock X is bought by Player X, the Marks of the bid
      shall be transfered from Player X to the Bank.
      If a given Stock X is bought by another Player (or Players) then
      Player X, the Marks of the bid shall go from this Player(s) to
      Player X.

      The Banker shall keep track of the Stocks held by each Player.

Rule 728 (Mutable)
Destruction of and Compensation for Stocks of Leaving Players

728.  Stocks of leaving Players I

      When Player X leaves the game, Stock X shall be destroyed.
      If Stock X was held at that time by another Player, this Player
      shall be compensated with half the price in Marks that this
      Player paid for the Stock X.
      These Marks shall come from the account of Player X, *before*
      those shall be destroyed, as required by other Rules.
      If there are not enough Marks available, the deficit shall be

Rule 733 (Mutable)
Default Rules for Officers

733.  Default Rules for Officers

      An Official is any Player who has been Appointed or Elected to
      an Office specified in the Rules. A Judge is not an Officer.
      An Officer may be replaced by another Player, by a Proposal
      stating so, and that Proposal passes.
      An Officer may resign at any time, provided e appoints a
      successor.
      If an Officer resigns while a Proposal is being voted upon to
      replace eim, the Player proposed will by eis Successor.
      This Rule applies to general Offices, and therefore defers to
      Rules for specific Offices.

The Marxist

736.  The Marxist

      Let there be the Patent Title known as "Marxist", which is
      awarded to the Player with the most Marks, or if tied, to the
      Players with the most Marks. Only the current richest Player
      or Players may hold this title.

      The determination and announcement of assignment and revoking
      of the Title is made by the Banker, who must use the most
      accurate means of determining this available to eim, and must
      make the announcement as soon as possible after becoming aware
      of a change in holder of the Title.

      However: To respect some Players' wish for privacy, and in
      view of the secret nature of Marks accounts, a prospective
      Marxist must first be asked if e wants the Title. If not, then
      instead of announcing, "Player x is granted the Patent Title of
      'Marxist', e announces, "Patent Title of 'Marxist' is granted
       to an anonymous Player".

      Destroyed as explicitly stated by the Rules. If a Conserved
      Quantity is given to an Entity, and no Rule states where that
      Conserved Quantity is to be taken from, then the transfer shall
      not take place. If a Conserved Quantity is taken from an Entity,

      Once the identity of the Auctioneer is determined, the Auction
      begins with the Auctioneer making an announcement to the game
      forum stating what  Nomic entity is up for Auction, and that e
      is accepting bids.
 
      Players who wish to participate in the Auction then must
      indicate their interest by sending a bid to the Auctioneer.
 
      The list of players who have indicated an interest is not

Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal

761.  Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal: Adjusting for Abstentions

      When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the Votes which
      have been legally cast shall be counted by the Speaker. If a
      Proposal is not Contested, and there are more FOR votes cast
      then AGAINST votes, then that Proposal shall take effect.  If
      such a Proposal has an equal number of FOR and AGAINST Votes,
      then the Speaker shall decide whether the Proposal shall be
      Adopted, or if that Proposal shall fail. If the Proposal is
      Contested, and the number of FOR votes cast is at least twice
      the number of AGAINST votes cast, then that Proposal shall take
      effect.

      If a Rule will change the actions required of or forbidden to
      the Speaker, and the Speaker opposed the Proposal, then that
      Proposal shall be considered Contested. The Speaker shall

      Treasury as specified in the Y Ordinances.  If the Y Ordinances
      are silent on this issue, or if Group Y has ceased to exist,
      then 1/N times the contents of the Y Treasury, rounded
      downwards, shall be transferred to Player X, where N is the
      number of Members of Group Y immediately before Player X ceased
      to be a Member of Group Y.  This transfer is not taxable, and

Rule 764 (Mutable)
Mischief

764.  Mischief

      Any Player or Group X may perform an Act of Mischief directed
      at any Player or Group Y.  The permissible forms of Mischief
      are defined in other Rules; such definitions must include a 
      positive Price in Coins, or the form of Mischief is not
      permissible.  This Rule explicitly takes precedence over all
      other Rules which purport to determine which forms of Mischief
      are permissible.

      To cause an Act of Mischief,  X  sends to the Public Forum a
      message containing:
      - the Name of the object, Y;
      - the effect of the Act of Mischief;
      - the Number of the Rule which permits the form of Mischief;
      - indication of which Coins in X's account will be used as
      payment for the Act of Mischief.  Coins of Group Y, or the
      Group to which Player Y belongs, may not be used as payment.  

      The effect of the Act of Mischief is applied immediately upon 
      publication of the above message in the Forum.  An additional
      effect of this Act of Mischief is that
      - for each Coin of Group Z spent as payment above, two Points
      are removed from the Z Treasury;
      - the Coins used as payment above are removed from X's account
      and destroyed.

Rule 766 (Mutable)
Groups

766.  Amend Rule 714.

      A Group is initially formed by a set of Players which has
      registered with the Registrar to form a Group; other Players may
      join later.  Each Group has a Name, a Membership, a Vizier,
      an Ordinancekeepor, a Treasury, an Initial Set of Ordinances,
      and an associated form of Currency, called the <name> Coins,
      where <name> is the Name of the Group.

      1.  The Name may not be the Name of another Group.

      2.  The Membership is a set of Players;  these Players are
      Members of the Group, and all other Players are not.

      3.  Synchronously with the registration of a Group, two Offices
      are created known as the <name> Vizier, and the <name>
      Ordinancekeepor, where <name> is the Name of the Group.
      These Offices may never be empty, and the <name> Vizier and
      <name> Ordinancekeepor must both be a member of <name> Group.
      The <name> Vizier shall inform the Registrar whenever the
      Membership or the Ordinancekeepor of the <name> group changes.
      When the <name> Vizier changes, the new Vizier shall inform the
      Registrar of the change.
      The <name> Ordinancekeepor shall keep an accurate and current
      record of the Ordinances of the <name> Group.

      4.  The Treasury is a repository for Points and Currencies and
      has the same capabilities for holding, trading, and spending
      Points and Currencies as does a Player.

      5.  The Ordinances are a description of the operation of the
      Group.

      6.  The <name> Coins are a form of Currency which is created
      synchronously with the registration of the Group.  The <name>
      Group may create <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be
      placed in the <name> Treasury.  The <name> Group may destroy
      <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be removed from the
      <name> Treasury.

Votes for Groups

767.  Amend Rule 646.

      If a Group has N Members then it has N Votes for each
      Proposal in addition to those of its Membership.  The
      Ordinances of a Group may determine how and when the Group
      casts its Votes; if the Ordinances are silent on this issue
      then the Group may not cast its Votes.  The Votes of the
      Group are cast when the Vizier sends a message to the Speaker
      to that effect during the Voting Period and this action is
      legitimate insofar as the Ordinances are concerned.

      When a Player submits a Proposal, e may pay one Mark to the Bank
      (if e has at least one Mark) and impose Sanity on that Proposal.
      E must inform both the Banker and the Speaker when doing so.
      A Proposal which has Sanity imposed upon it is known as a Sane
      Proposal.  The Speaker shall, when e distributes a Sane
      Proposal, inform the Players that it is a Sane Proposal.

      No non-Voter Nomic entity may Vote on a Sane Proposal.  Each
      Voter shall have exactly one Vote on a Sane Proposal, and
      each Voter's Vote shall be counted exactly once on a Sane
      Proposal.

      This rule takes precedence over any rule allowing a non-Voter
      Nomic entity to Vote; over any rule which gives any Voter
      more or less than one Vote on a proposal; and over any
      rule which would cause any Voter's Vote to be counted more or
      less than once.

      acted or has failed to act in such a way as to be in violation
      of one or more Rules, and this CFJ is Judged TRUE, then the
      Judge must issue an Injunction that the Ninny submit a Formal
      Apology.  This Injunction may also include a list of up to ten
      Prescribed Words.  By a Formal Apology is meant a letter of at
      least 200 words, containing all of the Prescribed Words,
      explaining the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
      for self-improvement, and posted in the Public Forum.  Within 48
      hours of the posting of this Formal Apology, the Squealer must
      either submit a Proposal that the Ninny's Apology be accepted,
      or submit a Proposal that the Ninny's Aplology be rejected,
      but not both.  No other Player may submit such a Proposal, and
      the Squealer may submit only one.  If a Proposal to accept the
      Apology fails, or if a Proposal to reject the Apology passes,
      then the Ninny loses 5 Points.

Abandonment of Speakerhood

785.  Improve Speaker Succession I

      If the Speaker has abandoned eir post, another new, Temporary
      Speaker is selected according to the "Rules of Succession", or
      if no such rules are defined, the other Player not on hold with
      the highest Score becomes the temporary Speaker.  This does not
      force the Game to be over in this case, and Scores are not reset
      to 0. The Game continues until a Player Wins, at which time a
      new Game is begun and the Winner becomes the real Speaker. The
      Temporary Speaker shall make reasonable effort to obtain the
      former Speaker's materials: proposal queue, voting records, etc.
      but if this is not possible, then the Temporary Speaker shall
      request that these be resubmitted by the Players. If a Speaker
      is replaced in this manner, e has eir score set to minus 2N
      Points immediately, where N is the number of Points required for
      a Player to Win the Game.

      Abandonment is determined as follows: If any Player suspects
      that the Speaker has Abandoned, e sends a message to all Players
      calling on the Speaker to announce eir presence.  The Speaker
      must reply to all Players within one week; if e does not, e is

      interpreted in a certain way, e shall also submit a list of
      Rules relevant to that CFJ, which must include the Rule in
      question.  If the statement is Judged TRUE, the Judge may
      include with the Judgement an Injuction requiring the Rulekeepor
      to annotate the Rule in question with the Statement in the CFJ
      and the list of relevant Rules.

      The annotation shall remain only until one of the Rules
      in the list of relevant Rules is amended, repealed, or
      transmuted; or until a CFJ determines that the injunction no
      longer applies, as described below.  While it remains, it shall
      guide the application of that Rule.

      If a Player believes that the circumstances which led to the
      Judgement no longer prevail and the annotation is therefore no
      longer applicable, e may submit a CFJ to that effect. If it is
      Judged TRUE, the annotation shall be stricken from the rule set.

         act as Judge for the Accusation; in any case where this would
         occur, a random Voter, neither Accuser nor Accused, shall be
         Judge.
      If the Statement is judged TRUE, the Accused Player has been
      found Guilty of breaking the Rule or committing the Crime, as
      applicable.  If the Statement is judged FALSE, the Accused
      Player has been found Not Guilty of breaking the Rule or

The trouble with scams is that they seem to strain the relations
between Players. Therefore I proto-propose the following.

Proto-PROPOSAL

The Loophole Committee.

There shall be three Officials known as the Loophole Judges.
Together they form the Loophole Committee.

Players who have an idea to exploit a loophole that they think
exists within the Rules shall send a message to the Committee
explaining in all detail the loophole and its consequences.

The Committee then shall deliberate on the idea and within one week
- publish a report on the feasibility of the player's idea
- award a number of points between 0 and 20 to the player who
submitted the idea
- submit a proposal to cure the loophole

The decision of the Loophole Committee shall be taken by a
majority of two out of three Judges.

The number of Points awarded shall stand in relation to the originality
of the idea, as well as the number of Points or Marks that could be
gained by exploiting the loophole.

The decision of the Committee on the number of points awarded can
be overturned by a Proposal, stating a different number between
0 and 20 Points.

CFJ 119

The Judge is Dave Nicol.

Scorekeepor:  Alice loses two points for declining Judgement.
  Jeffrey S.  (COTC at the time Alice declined) gains one point.
  (Rule 793)

CFJ: Garth  Feb 24 23:01:03 GMT-8
Judge: Alice  (Date unknown)
Declined: Mar 4 17:17:34 GMT-8(?)
Judge: Dave Nicol


Statement:

Scorekeepor KoJen Moved illegally in omitting the Stock Dividends from
eis Score Report.


Argument:

Rule 493 states that the Scorekeepor "must abide by all
rules governing scoring".  Further, Rule 542 states that the Scorekeepor
must inform all Players when "any quantity of Points mentioned in a Rule
changes".  Rule 463 defines the Score Report, and mandates that the
Scorekeepor make "eir best efforts to determine the correct scores".
Finally, Rule 725 states in no uncertain terms that upon Friday Noon
GMT of each Nomic Week, Stock Dividends are to be transferred between
Players.  Rule 725 thus "govern[s] scoring", and causes a "quantity
of Points" to "change".  Further, in ignoring an entire category of
eis duties, Scorekeepor KoJen cannot be argued to have made eis
"best efforts".  Therefore, the omission of the Stock Dividends was
illegal.  I have appended the text of the relevant Rules for the Judge's
convenience.

Request to the Judge:
I request that an Injunction be issued to include an accurate accounting
of the Stock Dividends in the Players' Scores.

Further, I will note that if the Statement is found to be TRUE, a Formal
Apology Injunction is mandatory.

Rule 493 (Mutable)
      There shall exist an Office known as Scorekeeper.

      The Scorekeeper is responsible for maintaining a list of the
      scores of all current players, making such a list available on
      request, and for notifying players in the event of a win on
      points.  He must abide by all rules governing scoring, but in
      cases where the rules are unclear or contradictory is to use his
      best judgement in determining scores.

      Salary:  The salary of the Scorekeeper is two points per week.

      Initial officeholder:  On passage of this proposal the Mighty
      Speaker becomes Scorekeeper.

----------------------------------------
Rule 542 (Mutable)
      Whenever any quantity of Points mentioned in a Rule changes, the
      Designated Scorekeeper shall notify all other players of said

Rule 463 (Mutable)
      At least once in any seven day period, the designated
      scorekeeper shall send the current scores of all Players to all
      Players, making eir best efforts to determine the correct
      scores. If a Player feels that the posted scores are in error,
      e may make a Call for Judgement, stating what e believes to be
      the correct scores. If the resulting Judgement is TRUE, then the
      scores shall be adjusted to the scores set forth in the Call for
      Judgement, modified further by any score changes which took
      place since the time the Call for Judgement was made. If such a
      Call for Judgement is not made within seven days of the posting
      of the scores, then those scores shall be considered to be the
      accurate and actual scores for the Game.


-----------------------------------------
Rule 725 (Mutable)
      Let there be for each Player one Currency called X Stock,
      where X is the name of the Player.

      On Friday Noon GMT 5% of the Points of Player X (with a minimum
      of two Points) shall be transfered to the Player (or Players)
      who holds Stock X.

      At the passing of this Proposal the Bank has possession of all
      Stocks.  During the following week the Banker shall collect the
      bids in Marks.  Those bids have to be made by the Players
      (either alone or acting together on the same Stock) in a message
      to the server.  No bid shall be made, which can not be covered
      by the Marks in  he bidders Bank account (to be verified by the
      Banker.)

      After one week each of the Stocks shall be transfered from the
      Bank to the highest bidder. If two or more bids for Stock X are
      exactly equal, the Stock shall go to player X (if one of the
      highest bidders), or to the Player with the lowest score.

      If a given Stock X is bought by Player X, the Marks of the bid
      shall be transfered from Player X to the Bank.
      If a given Stock X is bought by another Player (or Players) then
      Player X, the Marks of the bid shall go from this Player(s) to
      Player X.

      The Banker shall keep track of the Stocks held by each Player.

[Clerk's Note:  The time on the CFJ line is the time the CFJ was made.

Judgement, from the time *this* message is distributed.  That time
will be filled in on the "Judge" line when it is know.]


Statement:

Speaker Jeffrey S. violated Rule 208 by not distributing the results
of Proposal 826.


Argument:

Jeffrey S. claims to have "withdrawn" proposal 826, and he cites
Rule 116 as giving him permission to do so.  This is *not* permitted
by Rule 116, as such a "withdrawl" is in violation of other Rules.

Rule 106 states that all proposals proposed in the proper way shall
be voted on, while 693 specifies the voting period.  Rule 208 requires
the Speaker to post the result of the vote at the end of that voting
period.  Jeffrey S. did not do this.

There is no evidence that proposal 826 was not proposed in the proper
way.  Thus, it must be voted on for seven days, and at the end
of that time Jeffrey S. must post the results.  He did not do this.

Note that if this judgement is found to be TRUE, the Judge must issue
an Injunction as per Rule 781.  E may also issue the sort of Injunction
specified in Rule 665, and I would urge em to do so.  No doubt
Jeffrey S. (who proposed 826) saw a large number of AGAINST votes
coming in on his proposal, and decided he could avoid the F-A
penalty by withdrawing the proposal--a blatantly illegal action.
This time he has withdrawn his own proposal.  If we let him get
away with it, he may withdraw *your* proposal next time.


Relevant Rules and other Evidence:

Rule 106 (Immutable)
Adopting Proposed Rule Changes

106.

      All Rule Changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on.
      They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required
      number of votes and Quorum is achieved.

Rule 208 (Mutable)
End of the Voting Period

208.

      At the end of the prescribed Voting Period on a Proposal, the
      Speaker shall reveal all Votes legally cast on that Proposal. If
      the Speaker's consent may be required for a Proposal to be
      adopted then the Speaker should indicate at that time whether or
      not e gives eir consent.  If the Speaker does not explicitly
      indicate that e refuses to consent to the Proposal, it shall be
      assumed that e consents.

Rule 693 (Mutable)
Prescribed Voting Period

693.  Voting Period Definitions:

      The prescribed Voting Period for a Proposal shall be seven days,
      beginning at the time that the Proposal is distributed to all
      Players.

While the Rules would seem to permit the withdrawl of Proposals, it also
would seem to permit Voters to receive points based on how they voted
for withdrawn Proposals before they were withdrawn.

I list the Voters that voted on withdrawn Proposals and will let wiser
heads determine the outcome of this issue.

The Judge is Dave Nicol.

CFJ: Chuck  Mar. 7 13:48:38 GMT-6
Judge: Dave Nicol


Statement:

Rule 825 has no legal force in the current Ruleset.
Relevant Rules: 825, 106, 761, 376, 212, 201


Argument:

Rule 825 attempts to limit the effects of a proposal which would
have effects based on events which took place before passage of
that proposal.  (Note that 825 does *not*, in any case, affect the
passage of such a proposal.)  This is in conflict with Rule 376,
which states that a proposal takes full effect as soon as it is
adopted.  Neither 376 nor 825 claims to take precedence over or
defer to the other; thus by Rule 212, 376 takes precedence.  Such
a proposal as mentioned in Rule 825 *does* take full effect on
its adoption (376), and the votes required to adopt such a proposal
are defined in Rule 761.  Rule 106 states that a Rule is adopted
if it meets quorum (defined in 201) and receives the required number
of votes.

So for such a proposal (if it passes): proposal meets quorum (201)
and proposal receives required number of votes (761) ==> proposal
is adopted (106) ==> proposal takes effect as soon as the Speaker
reports it. (376)

Note that this CFJ alleges a certain interpretation of a Rule,
and, if Judged TRUE, the Judge may issue an Injunction of the
sort described in Rule 789.


Relevant Rules:


Rule 825 (Mutable)
Unanimous Vote Required for Effects Based on Past

825.  Vote AGAINST Without Recrimination

      Proposals may affect the game when the effect/s is based on
      votes or activities before the passage of said Proposal only if
      said Proposal was passed unanimously.

      For the purpose of this Rule, Proposals that are passed without
      receiving any AGAINST votes are considered to be unanimous.

Rule 106 (Immutable)
Adopting Proposed Rule Changes

106.

      All Rule Changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on.
      They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required
      number of votes and Quorum is achieved.

Rule 761 (Mutable)
Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal

761.  Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal: Adjusting for Abstentions

      When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the Votes which
      have been legally cast shall be counted by the Speaker. If a
      Proposal is not Contested, and there are more FOR votes cast
      then AGAINST votes, then that Proposal shall take effect.  If
      such a Proposal has an equal number of FOR and AGAINST Votes,
      then the Speaker shall decide whether the Proposal shall be
      Adopted, or if that Proposal shall fail. If the Proposal is
      Contested, and the number of FOR votes cast is at least twice
      the number of AGAINST votes cast, then that Proposal shall take
      effect.

      If a Rule will change the actions required of or forbidden to
      the Speaker, and the Speaker opposed the Proposal, then that
      Proposal shall be considered Contested. The Speaker shall
      declare if e opposes the Proposal when e distributes the
      Proposal.
      (*Was: 658*)

Rule 376 (Mutable)
When Does a Rule Change Take Effect?

376.  Time that a rule change takes effect:

      An adopted rule change takes full effect at the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it.
      The moment of the completion of the vote is defined by the date
      and time given in the line starting with "Date:" of the Nomic
      listserver message send by the Benevolent Speaker, announcing
      the result of the vote on the corresponding proposal.


Rule 201 (Mutable)
Quorum

201.

      Quorum for a proposed Rule Change is defined to be 20% of Voters
      at the beginning of the prescribed Voting Period for that
      Proposal.

Rule 212 (Mutable)
Resolving Rule Conflicts

212.

      If two or more Mutable Rules conflict with one another, or if
      two or more Immutable Rules conflict with one another, then the
      Rule with the lowest ordinal Number takes precedence.
        If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of rule) or takes
      precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.
        If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

The Judge is KoJen.

CFJ: Garth  Mar. 21 13:50:28 GMT-8
Judge: KoJen


Statement:

The Foreign Policy Directive instated by Proposal 861 is without
legal force.


Argument:

Proposal 861 purports to be a Foreign Policy Directive (FPD),
yet Rule 809 defines a FPD as a Proposal that directs the Ambassador on
how to handle "a single piece of Foreign Policy business."  Proposal 861,
however, purports to require the Ambassador to give Points *whenever* a
Nomic is found.  Further, since giving Points is not a piece of Foreign
Policy, it cannot be enforced by a FPD.  Remember, a FPD is not a Rule!

Request to the Judge:  I request an Injunction forbidding any Point 
transfers based on Proposal 861.  (Yes, that includes Point transfers to
*me*, as well.  861 has no power to do any such thing.)

Extra congratulations to Garth for using the sneaky trick of selling one of his
Marks for 20 Points which put him in the lead!

This is clearly wrong. I knew that somewhere in there Garth became the Winner.
But as you say, it was before the 3/16 lottery. As the score reports were so
far behind, I wanted to be able to announce a winner in a hurry.

I will make some adjustments. The Game actually ended on 3/14. Scores were
reset to 0 there, and the Lottery award was made in the current Game.

CFJ 120

Scorekeepor:  KoJen receives three points for his Judgement.  It seems
probable that KoJen also receives two points for making it within
72 hours, but I cannot determine that with certainty.

CFJ: Dave Bowen  Mar 1 14:54:57 GMT+/-?
Judge: KoJen  (date unknown)
Judgement:  Mar 4 07:59:28 GMT-5


Statement:

   The Registrar erred in failing to consider the quantum mechanical
uncertainties when he performed his Walrus calculations.


Judgement: FALSE


Argument: [Dave Bowen]

Even the Registrar agrees that in the 10^-100 sec lifetime of
the Walruses there is an immense uncertainty in the energy present. This
uncertainty in the energy (10^73 ergs) vastly outweighs the energy of a
Walrus in ground state (10^28 ergs) that any claim that only a single
Walrus was created in the interval is ludicrous.  Almost certainly there were
additional Walrus anti-Walrus pairs created along with more mundane things
like photons, pi mesons, and top quarks and their corresponding antiparticles.


Reasons and Arguments: [KoJen]

I must regretfully judge FALSE, my personal feelings on the Walruses and my
Group affiliations notwithstanding.

Reasoning: A CFJ must first take into account Rules. If the Rules are silent,
then Game Custom. And finally, real-world conventions. The Rules on Walruses
(while they existed) were specific in specifying the nature of Walrus
interactions, and there was no suggestion that they were affected by
quantum-mechanical uncertainties.

One could perhaps claim that the Walrus Rules themselves were inconsistent
because they conflict with the real-world truism of quantum-mechanics, but that
is another CFJ. My duty as judge of this CFJ was to determine if the Registrar
followed the Rules; not whether the Rules should have been followed.

Yes! The scores were very close. Amazingly close.

Whether KoJen received 5 or 3 Points for that judgeship, then KoJen reached 229
or 227 points on 3/14, synchronously with the time that Garth reached 171.7
Points (since both over-the-top gains were the result of salaries), and take
place at noon on the start of the Nomic week.

Thus, both Players became Champions, and the Speakership is determined by a
drawing. 

* I seem to recall that I was late in getting the Judgement sent in, and missed
the 72 hour deadline by 4 seconds. So it's only 3 Points, not that this matters
much. 


Therefore...

It appears that we have 2 Champions:

        Champion Garth
        Champion Champion*6/5 Champion*7/5 KoJen

Speaker is chosen by lottery.


KoJen

(Believe me, I really didn't want this to happen). I would rather have the
points-to-marks conversions, and I don't want to risk getting speakership
again.)

In my previous message I listed the scores as of the beginning of the current
game. This current report will cover the period 3/14 through 3/21.

Note that there were no stock dividends on 3/18; all stocks are currently in
the bank.

Point changes through 3/21:

**** NOTE ****

A few comments on the above point changes: Those beginning with a semicolon (;)
were requested but were impossible to carry out because these were voluntary
transfers by a Player with insufficient Points.

Oerjan: your 2 point transfer to prosirup was impossible to execute

Jeffrey: your 5 point transfer to garth was impossible to execute.

Stella: your fantasy round deal transfers were impossible to execute. You may
wish to consider making an equivalent Marks contribution?

Anyway,...

I accept the role of judge for cfj 123.

The arguments presented in the CFJ are coherent -- it looks like the
rule in question lacks the precedence clause it needs.  Would anyone who
disagrees please send me your argument so that I may consider it?

By rule 793 I am not required to accept Judgement, only notify the
CotC if I choose to decline, however, if Dave N's example is anything
to go by, practice hasn't kept up with the law, so I'll just take this
opportunity to say that I am greatly honoured to be selected for the
task of judging cfj 122, and I'd just like to thank ... :-)

OK, since I had 0 Points I suppose I wasn't required to do the transfer
anyhow.
However, as of this week:
I hereby transfer 2 Points to the PROSIRUP Treasury.

A couple of comments from the previous Clerk of the Courts.  


KoJen's decision was returned to me after the time limit for the bonus.

KoJen's decision was sent to the CotC, but not from the CotC to Players
using official channels.  Rather, KoJen, with my knowledge, posted his
decision so that Players could have an idea of the outcome because of the
scandal that was going on at the time.

It is my understanding, and I may be wrong, that points for decisions are
awarded when requested by CotC to the Scorekeeper.  I never did so.  But
I believe that Chuck, the current CotC did so today.

CFJ 125

The Judge is David Nicol.

CFJ: Stella?  Mar 23 02:05:21
Judge: David Nicol

[Clerk's Note: In this and all CFJ's after this one, all times
listed are my local time.  That is, GMT-6 for dates before
Apr 3 02:00:00, and GMT-5 for dates on or after Apr 3 03:00:00.]


Statement:

"Proposal 861, while being a Foreign Policy Directive, was not a
Non-Rule-Change Proposal in the sense of Rule 807.
Hence after its adoption it should have been included by the Rulekeepor
in the Rule Set."


Argument: [Stella?]

Nowhere in the Rules it says that a Foreign Policy Directive
is not to be treated as an ordinary proposed rule change.
Apart from that, not including a Proposed Rule Change in the Rule Set, sets
the dangerous precedent that such a Rule can not be amended, or repealed
if so desired by the Players. A fact which would make it even more
immutable than the Immutables!

The Judge is Ian.

Scorekeepor: David Nicol loses two points for declining Judgement.
Chuck receives one point.

CFJ: Garth  Feb 24 23:01:03 GMT-8(?)
Judge: Alice  (Date unknown)
Declined: Mar 4 17:17:34 GMT-8(?)
Judge: David Nicol  Mar 23 00:25:50 GMT-6
Declined:  Mar 23 17:01:47 GMT-6
Judge: Ian


Statement:

Scorekeepor KoJen Moved illegally in omitting the Stock Dividends from
eis Score Report.


Argument: [Garth]

Rule 493 states that the Scorekeepor "must abide by all
rules governing scoring".  Further, Rule 542 states that the Scorekeepor
must inform all Players when "any quantity of Points mentioned in a Rule
changes".  Rule 463 defines the Score Report, and mandates that the
Scorekeepor make "eir best efforts to determine the correct scores".
Finally, Rule 725 states in no uncertain terms that upon Friday Noon
GMT of each Nomic Week, Stock Dividends are to be transferred between
Players.  Rule 725 thus "govern[s] scoring", and causes a "quantity
of Points" to "change".  Further, in ignoring an entire category of
eis duties, Scorekeepor KoJen cannot be argued to have made eis
"best efforts".  Therefore, the omission of the Stock Dividends was
illegal.  I have appended the text of the relevant Rules for the Judge's
convenience.

Request to the Judge:
I request that an Injunction be issued to include an accurate accounting
of the Stock Dividends in the Players' Scores.

Further, I will note that if the Statement is found to be TRUE, a Formal
Apology Injunction is mandatory.

Rule 493 (Mutable)
      There shall exist an Office known as Scorekeeper.

      The Scorekeeper is responsible for maintaining a list of the
      scores of all current players, making such a list available on
      request, and for notifying players in the event of a win on
      points.  He must abide by all rules governing scoring, but in
      cases where the rules are unclear or contradictory is to use his
      best judgement in determining scores.

      Salary:  The salary of the Scorekeeper is two points per week.

      Initial officeholder:  On passage of this proposal the Mighty
      Speaker becomes Scorekeeper.

----------------------------------------
Rule 542 (Mutable)
      Whenever any quantity of Points mentioned in a Rule changes, the
      Designated Scorekeeper shall notify all other players of said
      Point change and the reasons for it.

----------------------------------------
Rule 463 (Mutable)
      At least once in any seven day period, the designated
      scorekeeper shall send the current scores of all Players to all
      Players, making eir best efforts to determine the correct
      scores. If a Player feels that the posted scores are in error,
      e may make a Call for Judgement, stating what e believes to be
      the correct scores. If the resulting Judgement is TRUE, then the
      scores shall be adjusted to the scores set forth in the Call for
      Judgement, modified further by any score changes which took

-----------------------------------------
Rule 725 (Mutable)
      Let there be for each Player one Currency called X Stock,
      where X is the name of the Player.

      On Friday Noon GMT 5% of the Points of Player X (with a minimum
      of two Points) shall be transfered to the Player (or Players)
      who holds Stock X.

      At the passing of this Proposal the Bank has possession of all
      Stocks.  During the following week the Banker shall collect the
      bids in Marks.  Those bids have to be made by the Players
      (either alone or acting together on the same Stock) in a message
      to the server.  No bid shall be made, which can not be covered
      by the Marks in  he bidders Bank account (to be verified by the
      Banker.)

      After one week each of the Stocks shall be transfered from the
      Bank to the highest bidder. If two or more bids for Stock X are
      exactly equal, the Stock shall go to player X (if one of the
      highest bidders), or to the Player with the lowest score.

      If a given Stock X is bought by Player X, the Marks of the bid
      shall be transfered from Player X to the Bank.
      If a given Stock X is bought by another Player (or Players) then
      Player X, the Marks of the bid shall go from this Player(s) to
      Player X.

      The Banker shall keep track of the Stocks held by each Player.

CFJ: Stella?  Mar 23 02:05:21
Judge: David Nicol  Mar 23 10:52:03
Judgement:  Mar. 23 17:05:05



Statement:

"Proposal 861, while being a Foreign Policy Directive, was not a
Non-Rule-Change Proposal in the sense of Rule 807.
Hence after its adoption it should have been included by the Rulekeepor
in the Rule Set."


Judgement: TRUE


Injunction:  I injunct that the Rulekeepor should include Foreign Policy
Directives in the Rule Set.


Argument: [Stella?]

Nowhere in the Rules it says that a Foreign Policy Directive
is not to be treated as an ordinary proposed rule change.
Apart from that, not including a Proposed Rule Change in the Rule Set, sets
the dangerous precedent that such a Rule can not be amended, or repealed
if so desired by the Players. A fact which would make it even more
immutable than the Immutables!

PROTOPROPOSAL

Only 4 types of Proposed Rule Changes
(Amends a Rule)

The first paragraph of Rule 807 is amended to read:

Proposals may be made which do not contain Rule Changes.  All
proposals, except those which have one of the following
declarations:
    (Creates a Rule)
    (Amends a Rule)
    (Repeals a Rule)
    (Transmutes a Rule)
are Non-Rule-Change Proposals (or NRC Proposals).  However,
only those NRC Proposals defined in other Rules may
be proposed.

[It's nice to *know* when voting whether or not a proposal
will change the Rules, unlike in proposal 861.]

Statement:

In delivering judgement on CFJ 125, David Nicol violated
Rule 591.


Argument:

David Nicol did not provide anything even vaguely resembling "reasons

Evidence:

Rule 591 (Mutable)
Legal Judgements

591.  Legal Judgement

      A legal Judgement is either TRUE, FALSE, or UNDECIDED. The
      Judgement must be accompanied by reasons and arguments, which
      include, but are not necessarily limited to, citations of
      deciding Rules, past Judgements, and game custom. A Judgement
      delivered without reasons and/or arguments is completely invalid.

      Such reasons and arguments form no part of the Judgement itself.
      However, the Clerk of the Courts must distribute the reasons and
      arguments along with the Judgement.

CFJ: Chuck  Mar 23 23:05:16
Judge: Duane


Statement:

In delivering judgement on CFJ 125, David Nicol violated Rule
663.


Argument:

The Injunction which David Nicol attempted to serve in his judgement
is in violation of Rule 663, which specifies that any Injunctions
must be as described in other Rules.  There is no Rule describing
an Injunction of the sort which David Nicol attempted to deliver.

While the Injunction described in Rule 665 might seem to match
the Injunction which David Nicol delivered, there are *three*
problems, any one of which alone would invalidate the Injunction.
1) the CFJ does not allege that I violated any Rule, only that
I "should" have included Rule 861 in the Ruleset.  2) the adjustments
to the Game State were not "unambiguously specified" within the CFJ.
3) the CFJ applies to proposal 861 only, and not to all FPD's;
however, the attempted Injunction applies to all FPD's.

Note that if this CFJ is found TRUE, the Judge must issue an Injunction
of the sort described in Rule 781.

Evidence:

Rule 663 (Mutable)
Injunctions--General

663.  General Rules For Injunctions

      There shall be an entity known as an Injunction, which may
      accompany certain Judgements of TRUE or FALSE as provided in the
      rules. An Injunction is a statement or series of statements
      specifying an action or actions which must take place. If a
      Judgement is is accompanied by an Injunction, that Injunction
      must be published with the Judgement. All players must abide by
      the Injunction beginning no later than 72 hours after its
      publication unless one of the following conditions then apply:
        - The Judgement which the Injunction accompanies is undergoing
          appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of the appeal
          process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but a proposal
          has been published which would overturn that decision if
          passed, and said proposal has not failed.
        - The validity of the Injunction itself is questioned by a
          pending CFJ.
        - A Judgement upholding the validity of the Injunction is
          undergoing appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of
          the appeal process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but
          a proposal has been published which would overturn that
          decision if passed, and said proposal has not failed.

      A Judgement may not be accompanied by an Injunction unless it is
      specifically permitted elsewhere in the rules. An Injunction
      must be completely consistent with all rules in effect at the
      time of issuance, and must be completely relevant to the matter
      addressed in the corresponding judgement.

      If any Player believes that an Injunction or any part of it does
      not meet the criteria for a valid Injunction, e may submit a CFJ
      to that effect. If the resulting Judgement supports the
      contention that the criteria are not met, the Injunction shall
      be considered illegal and shall have no legal force.

      This rule takes precedence over all rules governing Injunctions.

Rule 665 (Mutable)
Injuction--Retracting an Illegal Move

665.  Specific Injunctions, part I

      If a CFJ alleges that a specific Move is illegal, and the
      Judgement supports the allegation, the Judge may include with
      the Judgement an Injunction specifying that the move is to be
      retracted, and any resulting adjustments to the published game
      state. The adjustments to the game state must have been
      unambiguously specified within the CFJ, and these adjustments
      must only undo actions which were a direct or indirect result of
      that Move.

I sent the following message already to the CotC directly (as I am

I judge this statement to be FALSE.

Reading the part of Judge David L. Nicol's messages after his ruling
one's first impression is indeed that the Judge is violating Rule 591,
as reasons and arguments to the Judgment *seem* to be absent.

However, as "All Players must always abide by all the Rules then in
effect" (Rule 101) and as Judge Nicol has the right to a fair Judgment,
I shall discuss this part of the message in detail (I numbered the lines):

1>I injunct that the Rulekeepor should include Foreign Policy Directives in
2>the Rule Set.
3>
4> -/**\**/**\**/**\**/**\**/**\**/**\**/**\**/**\**/**\**/**\**/**\**/**\**/**

6>                                David L. Nicol
7>    DNICOL@CSTP.UMKC.EDU
8>
9>                    "Philosophy is useless, theology is worse."

Rule 591 requires
     "  ...  reasons and arguments, which
      include, but are not necessarily limited to, citations of
      deciding Rules, past Judgements, and game custom."

It is clear to this Judge that line 9) can be interpreted as such an argument.
It says that all philosopy about 861 as expressed in the listserver
messages and all actions that lead to the submission of CFJ 125 are
useless. I agree as obviously the first thing that counts are the Rules!

Rule 591 requires also that the reasons and arguments include citations
from, for instance, Rules.
I shall argue that line 1) and 2) do so!

First of all "to injunct" is a non-existing word. This Judge could
not find the word nor in his Oxford Minidictionary, nor in his online
dictionary. Therefore I can savely assume that line 1 and 2 do not comprise
an Injunction, which in any case would have been illegal for CFJ 125.
(Again I'd like to give Judge Nicol the benefit of the doubt of not
having violated a Rule.)

I therefore have to assume that "injunct" is a misspelling.

Rule 754 says about misspellings:
     "Differences in spelling, grammar, or dialect, or the
      substitution of a word or phrase by a synonym or abbreviation,
      are inconsequential in all forms of Nomic communication, as long
      as there is no ambiguity in meaning."

As we expect "the reasons and arguments" to come directly after the
Judgment, there can be no ambiguity: "injunct" is a misspelling for
"argue".

Secondly, the citations. I find the following:
"that" (Rules 102, 105, 108, 110, 111, 115, 212 and many others)
"the Rulekeepor" (Rules 399, 789)
"should" (Rules 208, 405, 602, 789, etc)
"include" (Rules 103, 455, 591, 665 etc)
"Foreign Policy Directives" (Rule 809)
"in" (Rule 101, among dozens of others)
"the Rule Set (Rule 454)

Therefore, even if Judge Nicol violated the spirit of Rule 591,
he certainly didn't violate the letter of it.
(And neither did I in this Judgment!)

On a personal note: too bad I couldn't Rule TRUE on this CFJ.
Because then I would have been obliged to issue an Injunction
that Judge Nicol submit a Formal Apology (Rule 781).
My list of ten Prescribed Words would have been:

"Whoever","dislikes","Scams","is","self","a","Ninny","too","by","Jove".

Judge Stella?

Here's my Proto-Proposal on Repealing Judgements.  I've added the
stuff on Impeachment in response to someone saying that this
method gives the CotC too much power.  If someone can think of a
better way, just let me know.

                 Garth

==========================

Appealing Judgements and the Supreme Justice
(Amends a Rule)

Rule 690 is Amended in its entirety to read:

At any time in the week following the return of a Judgment on a
Call for Judgment, any Player may submit a Proposal that the
Judgment on that Statement be reconsidered.  The Player must
state eis reasoning in the Proposal.

Such a Proposal is automatically Sane, and shall require at least
three times as many FOR Votes as AGAINST Votes to pass.  If it
passes, the Clerk of the Courts shall sit in Judgment on the
Statement in eis capacity as Supreme Justice.  The Supreme Justice
shall be in all ways like a Judge, save that eis decision is final,
and e shall receive twice the compensation that a Judge would for
Judging the same Statement.

If a Player feels that the Supreme Justice did not act impartially
or fairly in eis decision, e may submit a Proposal that the Clerk
of the Courts be Impeached within one week of the decision.

If the Clerk is Impeached in this manner, e must return eis compensation
as Supreme Justice to the Point Reserve.
==========================

Impeachment of Officers
(Creates a Rule)

Impeachment is defined as the removal of an Officer for acting in
a manner unbecoming of eis Office (to be defined in the Rules).

An Officer that is Impeached shall pay the penalty of a Class D
Crime, and shall be removed from Office without being permitted to
appoint a successor.  If an Officer should resign eis Office while
in the process of being Impeached, e may not appoint a successor.

Impeachment is accomplished by a special Proposal, which may only be
made in circumstances explicitly delineated in the Rules.  A Proposal
to Impeach an Officer shall automatically be Sane, and shall only pass
if it receives at most one Vote of AGAINST.

An Impeachment Proposal is made with the following legal Declaration:
   (Impeaches an Officer)

CFJ 126

Scorekeepor: Stella? receives 5 points for speedy judgement.

CFJ: Chuck  Mar 23 23:04:37
Judge: Stella?  Mar 24 00:14:49
Judgement:  Mar 24 07:23:55


Statement:

In delivering judgement on CFJ 125, David Nicol violated
Rule 591.


Judgement: FALSE


Argument: [Chuck]

David Nicol did not provide anything even vaguely resembling "reasons
and arguments" in his judgement.  Note that if this is Judged TRUE,
the Judge must issue an Injunction of the sort described in Rule 781.


Evidence:

Rule 591 (Mutable)
Legal Judgements

591.  Legal Judgement

      A legal Judgement is either TRUE, FALSE, or UNDECIDED. The
      Judgement must be accompanied by reasons and arguments, which
      include, but are not necessarily limited to, citations of
      deciding Rules, past Judgements, and game custom. A Judgement
      delivered without reasons and/or arguments is completely invalid.

      Such reasons and arguments form no part of the Judgement itself.
      However, the Clerk of the Courts must distribute the reasons and
      arguments along with the Judgement.

CFJ 125

Scorekeepor: David Nicol receives 5 points for rapid judgement.

CFJ: Stella?  Mar 23 02:05:21
Judge: David Nicol  Mar 23 10:52:03
Judgement:  Mar. 23 17:05:05



Statement:

"Proposal 861, while being a Foreign Policy Directive, was not a
Non-Rule-Change Proposal in the sense of Rule 807.
Hence after its adoption it should have been included by the Rulekeepor
in the Rule Set."


Judgement: TRUE


Injunction:  I injunct that the Rulekeepor should include Foreign Policy
Directives in the Rule Set.


Argument: [Stella?]

Nowhere in the Rules it says that a Foreign Policy Directive
is not to be treated as an ordinary proposed rule change.
Apart from that, not including a Proposed Rule Change in the Rule Set, sets
the dangerous precedent that such a Rule can not be amended, or repealed
if so desired by the Players. A fact which would make it even more
immutable than the Immutables!

I accept my role as Judge for this CFJ

I rule TRUE

I injunct that the Rulekeepor should include Foreign Policy Directives in
the Rule Set.

                    "Philosophy is useless, theology is worse."


Reasons and Arguments: [Stella?]

I judge this statement to be FALSE.

Reading the part of Judge David L. Nicol's messages after his ruling
one's first impression is indeed that the Judge is violating Rule 591,
as reasons and arguments to the Judgment *seem* to be absent.

However, as "All Players must always abide by all the Rules then in
effect" (Rule 101) and as Judge Nicol has the right to a fair Judgment,
I shall discuss this part of the message in detail (I numbered the lines):

1>I injunct that the Rulekeepor should include Foreign Policy Directives in
2>the Rule Set.
3>
4> -/**\**/**\**/**\**/**\**/**\**/**\**/**\**/**\**/**\**/**\**/**\**/**\**/**
5>
6>                                David L. Nicol
7>    DNICOL@CSTP.UMKC.EDU
8>
9>                    "Philosophy is useless, theology is worse."

Rule 591 requires
     "  ...  reasons and arguments, which
      include, but are not necessarily limited to, citations of
      deciding Rules, past Judgements, and game custom."

It is clear to this Judge that line 9) can be interpreted as such an argument.
It says that all philosopy about 861 as expressed in the listserver
messages and all actions that lead to the submission of CFJ 125 are
useless. I agree as obviously the first thing that counts are the Rules!

Rule 591 requires also that the reasons and arguments include citations
from, for instance, Rules.
I shall argue that line 1) and 2) do so!

First of all "to injunct" is a non-existing word. This Judge could
not find the word nor in his Oxford Minidictionary, nor in his online
dictionary. Therefore I can savely assume that line 1 and 2 do not comprise
an Injunction, which in any case would have been illegal for CFJ 125.
(Again I'd like to give Judge Nicol the benefit of the doubt of not
having violated a Rule.)

I therefore have to assume that "injunct" is a misspelling.

Rule 754 says about misspellings:
     "Differences in spelling, grammar, or dialect, or the
      substitution of a word or phrase by a synonym or abbreviation,
      are inconsequential in all forms of Nomic communication, as long
      as there is no ambiguity in meaning."

As we expect "the reasons and arguments" to come directly after the
Judgment, there can be no ambiguity: "injunct" is a misspelling for
"argue".

Secondly, the citations. I find the following:
"that" (Rules 102, 105, 108, 110, 111, 115, 212 and many others)
"the Rulekeepor" (Rules 399, 789)
"should" (Rules 208, 405, 602, 789, etc)
"include" (Rules 103, 455, 591, 665 etc)
"Foreign Policy Directives" (Rule 809)
"in" (Rule 101, among dozens of others)
"the Rule Set (Rule 454)

Therefore, even if Judge Nicol violated the spirit of Rule 591,
he certainly didn't violate the letter of it.
(And neither did I in this Judgment!)

On a personal note: too bad I couldn't Rule TRUE on this CFJ.
Because then I would have been obliged to issue an Injunction
that Judge Nicol submit a Formal Apology (Rule 781).
My list of ten Prescribed Words would have been:

"Whoever","dislikes","Scams","is","self","a","Ninny","too","by","Jove".

CFJ: Chuck  Mar 24 00:18:47
Judge: Garth


Statement:

Rule 856 has no legal force.
Relevant Rules: 856, 761, 212


Argument: [Chuck]

Rule 856 conflicts with Rule 761 in all cases where
Rule 856 might otherwise apply.  As neither explicitly takes
precedence over or defers to the other, then by Rule 212, Rule
761 takes precedence.

I ask the Judge to issue an Injunction that Rule 856 be annotated,
as described in Rule 791.


Rule 856 (Mutable)
Votes Required to Create/Destroy a Conserved Quantity

856.  Conserved Quantities Really ARE Conserved, Part I

      Any Proposal which introduces a new way to Create or Destroy
      a Conserved Quantity shall require at least three times as
      many FOR Votes as AGAINST Votes in order to pass.  This
      restriction does not apply to Proposals which define new
      Conserved Quantities or Create the initial stock of a new
      Conserved Quantity.

Rule 761 (Mutable)
Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal

761.  Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal: Adjusting for Abstentions

      When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the Votes which
      have been legally cast shall be counted by the Speaker. If a
      Proposal is not Contested, and there are more FOR votes cast
      then AGAINST votes, then that Proposal shall take effect.  If
      such a Proposal has an equal number of FOR and AGAINST Votes,
      then the Speaker shall decide whether the Proposal shall be
      Adopted, or if that Proposal shall fail. If the Proposal is
      Contested, and the number of FOR votes cast is at least twice
      the number of AGAINST votes cast, then that Proposal shall take
      effect.

      If a Rule will change the actions required of or forbidden to
      the Speaker, and the Speaker opposed the Proposal, then that
      Proposal shall be considered Contested. The Speaker shall
      declare if e opposes the Proposal when e distributes the
      Proposal.
      (*Was: 658*)

Rule 212 (Mutable)
Resolving Rule Conflicts

212.

      If two or more Mutable Rules conflict with one another, or if
      two or more Immutable Rules conflict with one another, then the
      Rule with the lowest ordinal Number takes precedence.
        If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of rule) or takes
      precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.
        If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

      the number of AGAINST votes cast, then that Proposal shall take
      effect.

      If a Rule will change the actions required of or forbidden to
      the Speaker, and the Speaker opposed the Proposal, then that
      Proposal shall be considered Contested. The Speaker shall
      declare if e opposes the Proposal when e distributes the
      Proposal.
      (*Was: 658*)

Rule 212 (Mutable)
Resolving Rule Conflicts

212.

      If two or more Mutable Rules conflict with one another, or if
      two or more Immutable Rules conflict with one another, then the
      Rule with the lowest ordinal Number takes precedence.
        If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of rule) or takes
      precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.
        If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

I have no idea. A "Freudian Slip" or something, I guess.

It should have read "Scorekeepor".

CFJ 122

Scorekeepor:  Michael receives 5 points for speedy judgement.
Chuck is refunded the 5 points he lost in making the CFJ.

CFJ: Chuck Mar 6 07:48:34 GMT-6
Judge: Michael Norrish  Mar 23 00:26:16
Judgement:  Mar 24 15:44:21


Statement:

Speaker Jeffrey S. violated Rule 208 by not distributing the results
of Proposal 826.


Judgement: TRUE


Injunction:  By rule 781, I am now required to issue an Injunction requiring
Jeffrey S to issue a formal apology. I do not require him to use any
particular words in this apology.


Argument: [Chuck]

Jeffrey S. claims to have "withdrawn" proposal 826, and he cites
Rule 116 as giving him permission to do so.  This is *not* permitted
by Rule 116, as such a "withdrawl" is in violation of other Rules.

Rule 106 states that all proposals proposed in the proper way shall
be voted on, while 693 specifies the voting period.  Rule 208 requires
the Speaker to post the result of the vote at the end of that voting
period.  Jeffrey S. did not do this.

There is no evidence that proposal 826 was not proposed in the proper
way.  Thus, it must be voted on for seven days, and at the end
of that time Jeffrey S. must post the results.  He did not do this.

Note that if this judgement is found to be TRUE, the Judge must issue
an Injunction as per Rule 781.  E may also issue the sort of Injunction
specified in Rule 665, and I would urge em to do so.  No doubt
Jeffrey S. (who proposed 826) saw a large number of AGAINST votes
coming in on his proposal, and decided he could avoid the F-A
penalty by withdrawing the proposal--a blatantly illegal action.
This time he has withdrawn his own proposal.  If we let him get
away with it, he may withdraw *your* proposal next time.


Relevant Rules and other Evidence:

Rule 106 (Immutable)
Adopting Proposed Rule Changes

106.

      All Rule Changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on.
      They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required
      number of votes and Quorum is achieved.

Rule 208 (Mutable)
End of the Voting Period

208.

      At the end of the prescribed Voting Period on a Proposal, the
      Speaker shall reveal all Votes legally cast on that Proposal. If
      the Speaker's consent may be required for a Proposal to be
      adopted then the Speaker should indicate at that time whether or
      not e gives eir consent.  If the Speaker does not explicitly
      indicate that e refuses to consent to the Proposal, it shall be
      assumed that e consents.

Rule 693 (Mutable)
Prescribed Voting Period

693.  Voting Period Definitions:

      The prescribed Voting Period for a Proposal shall be seven days,
      beginning at the time that the Proposal is distributed to all
      Players.

While the Rules would seem to permit the withdrawl of Proposals, it also
would seem to permit Voters to receive points based on how they voted
for withdrawn Proposals before they were withdrawn.

I list the Voters that voted on withdrawn Proposals and will let wiser
heads determine the outcome of this issue.

826    Chuck, Bowen, Nicol, Garth, KoJen, Stella?, Abelian, Oerjan

Reasons and Arguments: [Michael]

I judge the statement

--Speaker Jeffrey S. violated Rule 208 by not distributing the results
--of Proposal 826.

to be TRUE. 

In particular, without evidence to the contrary, there is nothing to
suggest that the proposal in question was improperly submitted.
(Indeed, the fact that the proposal was distributed by the Speaker in
accordance with 107 supports this.) In turn, this means that the
Speaker was neglecting his duties as per rule 208 which requires the
Speaker to `reveal all votes legally cast on that Proposal'.

By rule 781, I am now required to issue an Injunction requiring
Jeffrey S to issue a formal apology. I do not require him to use any
particular words in this apology.

It may also be the case that I have the right by 665 to issue an
Injunction to correct the situation. I can not do so however because
665 requires that the adjustments to the game state be `unambiguously
specified within the CFJ'. No such adjustments were so called for.

Finally, I wish to object to the following emotive attempt (from the
CFJ text) to influence the court:

   'Jeffrey S. ... decided he could avoid the F-A penalty by
    withdrawing the proposal--a blatantly illegal action. This time he
    has withdrawn his own proposal.  If we let him get away with it,
    he may withdraw *your* proposal next time.'

Statement:

Scorekeepor KoJen Moved illegally in omitting the Stock Dividends from
eis Score Report.


Argument: [Garth]

Rule 493 states that the Scorekeepor "must abide by all
rules governing scoring".  Further, Rule 542 states that the Scorekeepor
must inform all Players when "any quantity of Points mentioned in a Rule
changes".  Rule 463 defines the Score Report, and mandates that the
Scorekeepor make "eir best efforts to determine the correct scores".
Finally, Rule 725 states in no uncertain terms that upon Friday Noon
GMT of each Nomic Week, Stock Dividends are to be transferred between
Players.  Rule 725 thus "govern[s] scoring", and causes a "quantity
of Points" to "change".  Further, in ignoring an entire category of
eis duties, Scorekeepor KoJen cannot be argued to have made eis
"best efforts".  Therefore, the omission of the Stock Dividends was
illegal.  I have appended the text of the relevant Rules for the Judge's
convenience.

Request to the Judge:
I request that an Injunction be issued to include an accurate accounting
of the Stock Dividends in the Players' Scores.

Further, I will note that if the Statement is found to be TRUE, a Formal
Apology Injunction is mandatory.

Rule 493 (Mutable)
      There shall exist an Office known as Scorekeeper.

      The Scorekeeper is responsible for maintaining a list of the
      scores of all current players, making such a list available on
      request, and for notifying players in the event of a win on
      points.  He must abide by all rules governing scoring, but in
      cases where the rules are unclear or contradictory is to use his
      best judgement in determining scores.

      Salary:  The salary of the Scorekeeper is two points per week.

      Initial officeholder:  On passage of this proposal the Mighty
      Speaker becomes Scorekeeper.

----------------------------------------
Rule 542 (Mutable)
      Whenever any quantity of Points mentioned in a Rule changes, the
      Designated Scorekeeper shall notify all other players of said
      Point change and the reasons for it.

----------------------------------------
Rule 463 (Mutable)
      At least once in any seven day period, the designated
      scorekeeper shall send the current scores of all Players to all
      Players, making eir best efforts to determine the correct
      scores. If a Player feels that the posted scores are in error,
      e may make a Call for Judgement, stating what e believes to be
      the correct scores. If the resulting Judgement is TRUE, then the
      scores shall be adjusted to the scores set forth in the Call for
      Judgement, modified further by any score changes which took
      place since the time the Call for Judgement was made. If such a
      Call for Judgement is not made within seven days of the posting
      of the scores, then those scores shall be considered to be the
      accurate and actual scores for the Game.


-----------------------------------------
Rule 725 (Mutable)
      Let there be for each Player one Currency called X Stock,
      where X is the name of the Player.

      On Friday Noon GMT 5% of the Points of Player X (with a minimum
      of two Points) shall be transfered to the Player (or Players)
      who holds Stock X.

      At the passing of this Proposal the Bank has possession of all
      Stocks.  During the following week the Banker shall collect the
      bids in Marks.  Those bids have to be made by the Players
      (either alone or acting together on the same Stock) in a message
      to the server.  No bid shall be made, which can not be covered
      by the Marks in  he bidders Bank account (to be verified by the
      Banker.)

      After one week each of the Stocks shall be transfered from the
      Bank to the highest bidder. If two or more bids for Stock X are
      exactly equal, the Stock shall go to player X (if one of the
      highest bidders), or to the Player with the lowest score.

      If a given Stock X is bought by Player X, the Marks of the bid
      shall be transfered from Player X to the Bank.
      If a given Stock X is bought by another Player (or Players) then
      Player X, the Marks of the bid shall go from this Player(s) to
      Player X.

      The Banker shall keep track of the Stocks held by each Player.

CFJ 128

Scorekeepor: Dave Bowen receives 5 points for speedy Judgement.

CFJ: Chuck  Mar 24 00:18:47
Judge: Dave Bowen  Mar 24 13:36:49
Judgement:  Mar 25 09:39:24


Statement:

Rule 856 has no legal force.
Relevant Rules: 856, 761, 212


Judgement: TRUE


Injunction:

In accordance with Rule 798, I order that this decision be added
as an annotation to Rule 856, until either it or Rule 761 is changed or until
a future CFJ determines that the injuction no longer applies.

Argument: [Chuck]

Rule 856 conflicts with Rule 761 in all cases where
Rule 856 might otherwise apply.  As neither explicitly takes
precedence over or defers to the other, then by Rule 212, Rule
761 takes precedence.

I ask the Judge to issue an Injunction that Rule 856 be annotated,
as described in Rule 791.


Rule 856 (Mutable)
Votes Required to Create/Destroy a Conserved Quantity

856.  Conserved Quantities Really ARE Conserved, Part I

      Any Proposal which introduces a new way to Create or Destroy
      a Conserved Quantity shall require at least three times as
      many FOR Votes as AGAINST Votes in order to pass.  This
      restriction does not apply to Proposals which define new
      Conserved Quantities or Create the initial stock of a new
      Conserved Quantity.

Rule 761 (Mutable)
Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal

761.  Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal: Adjusting for Abstentions

      When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the Votes which
      have been legally cast shall be counted by the Speaker. If a
      Proposal is not Contested, and there are more FOR votes cast
      then AGAINST votes, then that Proposal shall take effect.  If
      such a Proposal has an equal number of FOR and AGAINST Votes,
      then the Speaker shall decide whether the Proposal shall be
      Adopted, or if that Proposal shall fail. If the Proposal is
      Contested, and the number of FOR votes cast is at least twice
      the number of AGAINST votes cast, then that Proposal shall take
      effect.

      If a Rule will change the actions required of or forbidden to
      the Speaker, and the Speaker opposed the Proposal, then that
      Proposal shall be considered Contested. The Speaker shall
      declare if e opposes the Proposal when e distributes the
      Proposal.
      (*Was: 658*)

Rule 212 (Mutable)
Resolving Rule Conflicts

212.

      If two or more Mutable Rules conflict with one another, or if
      two or more Immutable Rules conflict with one another, then the
      Rule with the lowest ordinal Number takes precedence.
        If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of rule) or takes
      precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.
        If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.


Reasons and Arguments: [Dave Bowen]

As Chuck points out in his arguments submitted with the CFJ, Rule
856 conflicts with Rule 761 in those cases where it would apply.  Since it
lacks a clause claiming precedence over Rule 761 and since Rule 761 does not
explicitly defer to Rule 856, either specifically or generally, the normal
precedence order applies and Rule 761 prevails.

CFJ 129

The Judge is KoJen

CFJ: Stella?  Mar 25 10:33:25
Judge: KoJen


Statement:

a) CFJ 122 makes a Statement about the current state of the Game,
as the Rule violation in question makes the current state different
from the proper game state in which the voting results of Proposal 826
would have been distributed.
b) As this statement is Judged TRUE, Rule 451 applies to it.
c) As Rule 451 takes precedence over Rule 463 (according to Rule 212)
any score changes that have happened in the time between the issuing
of CFJ 122 (March 6) and its delivery (March 24) must be taken into
account.
d) Therefore the score changes which resulted from several Players having
voted on Proposal 826 (notably Chuck, Dave B, David N., Garth, KoJen,
Stella? and Oerjan) should be taken into account in the score.


Argument: [Stella?]

Evidence: CFJ 122, Rule 212, 451, 463.

Judgement (!):  Mar 25 13:48:40 GMT-6


Statement:

Scorekeepor KoJen Moved illegally in omitting the Stock Dividends from
eis Score Report.


Judgement: UNDECIDED


Argument: [Garth]

Rule 493 states that the Scorekeepor "must abide by all
rules governing scoring".  Further, Rule 542 states that the Scorekeepor
must inform all Players when "any quantity of Points mentioned in a Rule
changes".  Rule 463 defines the Score Report, and mandates that the
Scorekeepor make "eir best efforts to determine the correct scores".
Finally, Rule 725 states in no uncertain terms that upon Friday Noon
GMT of each Nomic Week, Stock Dividends are to be transferred between
Players.  Rule 725 thus "govern[s] scoring", and causes a "quantity
of Points" to "change".  Further, in ignoring an entire category of
eis duties, Scorekeepor KoJen cannot be argued to have made eis
"best efforts".  Therefore, the omission of the Stock Dividends was
illegal.  I have appended the text of the relevant Rules for the Judge's
convenience.

Request to the Judge:
I request that an Injunction be issued to include an accurate accounting
of the Stock Dividends in the Players' Scores.

Further, I will note that if the Statement is found to be TRUE, a Formal
Apology Injunction is mandatory.

Rule 493 (Mutable)
      There shall exist an Office known as Scorekeeper.

      The Scorekeeper is responsible for maintaining a list of the
      scores of all current players, making such a list available on
      request, and for notifying players in the event of a win on
      points.  He must abide by all rules governing scoring, but in
      cases where the rules are unclear or contradictory is to use his
      best judgement in determining scores.

      Salary:  The salary of the Scorekeeper is two points per week.

      Initial officeholder:  On passage of this proposal the Mighty
      Speaker becomes Scorekeeper.

----------------------------------------
Rule 542 (Mutable)
      Whenever any quantity of Points mentioned in a Rule changes, the
      Designated Scorekeeper shall notify all other players of said
      Point change and the reasons for it.

----------------------------------------
Rule 463 (Mutable)
      At least once in any seven day period, the designated
      scorekeeper shall send the current scores of all Players to all
      Players, making eir best efforts to determine the correct
      scores. If a Player feels that the posted scores are in error,
      e may make a Call for Judgement, stating what e believes to be
      the correct scores. If the resulting Judgement is TRUE, then the
      scores shall be adjusted to the scores set forth in the Call for
      Judgement, modified further by any score changes which took
      place since the time the Call for Judgement was made. If such a
      Call for Judgement is not made within seven days of the posting
      of the scores, then those scores shall be considered to be the
      accurate and actual scores for the Game.


-----------------------------------------
Rule 725 (Mutable)
      Let there be for each Player one Currency called X Stock,
      where X is the name of the Player.

      On Friday Noon GMT 5% of the Points of Player X (with a minimum
      of two Points) shall be transfered to the Player (or Players)
      who holds Stock X.

      At the passing of this Proposal the Bank has possession of all
      Stocks.  During the following week the Banker shall collect the
      bids in Marks.  Those bids have to be made by the Players
      (either alone or acting together on the same Stock) in a message
      to the server.  No bid shall be made, which can not be covered
      by the Marks in  he bidders Bank account (to be verified by the
      Banker.)

      After one week each of the Stocks shall be transfered from the
      Bank to the highest bidder. If two or more bids for Stock X are
      exactly equal, the Stock shall go to player X (if one of the
      highest bidders), or to the Player with the lowest score.

      If a given Stock X is bought by Player X, the Marks of the bid
      shall be transfered from Player X to the Bank.
      If a given Stock X is bought by another Player (or Players) then
      Player X, the Marks of the bid shall go from this Player(s) to
      Player X.

      The Banker shall keep track of the Stocks held by each Player.


Reasons and Arguments: [Duane]

 From the Statement (and even the Arguement) there is no indication
as to when the Score Report in question was posted.  Therefore, I have no
way of knowing whether the Score report was posted on Friday at 11:59 GMT nor
can I go back and look up which Score Report was put into question as there
is no date given as well.  Therefore, I have no recourse but to judge Undecided
as that it was possible that the Score Report did overlook Stock Dividends but
it is also possible that the Score Report didn't require Stock Dividends 
either.

You're not drunk if you can lie on the floor without hanging on.

[Clerk's Note:  I liked that last line so much, I thought
it belonged in the Reasons and Arguments.  :)  ]

CFJ 130

The Judge is Michael.

Scorekeepor: Stella? loses 5 points for making this CFJ, which shall
be refunded if it is judged TRUE.

CFJ: Stella?  Mar 25 10:56:42
Judge: Michael


Statement:

The Injunction issued by Judge Bowen in CFJ 128 is illegal.


Argument: [Stella?]

Judge Bowen's Injunction orders that
"In accordance with Rule 798, I order that this decision be added
as an annotation to Rule 856, until either it or Rule 761 is changed or
until a future CFJ determines that the injuction no longer applies".

This is illegal on two accounts:
1) Rule 798 does not exist, only Rule 789 would apply
2) However, Rule 789 requires that
"The annotation shall remain only until one of the Rules
in the list of relevant Rules is amended, repealed, or transmuted"
Well, the list of relevant Rules as submitted by Chuck included
not only Rule 856 and 761, but 212 as well.
Hence, the Injunction is incomplete and hence illegal.

Here are the results of the Name of the Game Contest!

I scored Votes as follows:  A first choice received 4 blips,
a second choice 2, and a third choice 1.

The blip totals were:

Agora		18
Mu		13
Leviathan	12
Gordian		 9
Principia	 4
Spam		 4
Solon		 2
Libra		 1
Yoyo		 1

Yoyo and Spam were write-ins.

Agora is the Winner!  Since it was Entered by me, I will pay off to Oerjan
for his contribution of Mu.

                         Garth

P.S. If the Votes of the Lurkers, Watchers, and other interested parties are
included, it's a lot closer:

Agora		22
Mu		22
Leviathan	16
Gordian		10
Principia	 4
Spam		 4
Solon		 2
Libra		 1
Yoyo		 1

One more reason to join the game!
