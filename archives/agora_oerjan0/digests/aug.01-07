Jeffrey S. was the only Player to apply for the Office of Herald.
Therefore, he is the Herald!  Congratulations, Jeffrey.

Scorekeepor: Cran receive 1 point for conducting this election.

Cran would also like to request our very first Kudo transfer!

Herald, Cran hereby request the transfer of one Kudo from Michael
Norrish to Jeffrey S.

Jeffrey S. has recently been Honourable in not one, but two regards.
First, (as Cran noted above) he was the *only* Player to apply for
the Office of Herald.  Secondly, after there was considerable outrage
against a judgement of his, he returned his Judge's salary to the
Point Reserve.

Cran feel that Michael's distribution of proposals 965-969
in condensed form is disHonourable.  While it may be legal,
Cran would like to see the entire proposal as submitted.

Electioneer Chuck

Proposal 971

Proposer Timothy

Proto-ed? N

Date: Mon Aug  1 05:42:01 GMT 1994

Text: 
Collation of Propsals Rules
(Amends a rule)

Amend 884 to read:
A) There shall be a standard format for Proposals, as follows:

B) The word "PROPOSAL: " must be written at the top of the document.

C) The word "PROPOSAL:" shall be followed a title, which does not form 
part of the Proposal itself, and therefore does not form part of any
rule enacted or ammended by the proposal.

D) The title will be followed, on the same line, by the Proposer's name, in brackets.

E) The line immediately below that on which is written the title there shall 
be a Declaration, describing the effect that the rule change
will have upon the Rule Set.  The Declaration will be a short phrase in 
parantheses, from the following list:

         (Creates a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes a new
         Rule to come into existence.
		The body of a proposal following this declaration must be the 
		finished form of the new rule.   
         (Amends a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes an
         existing Rule to change wording or form.
		The body of a proposal following this must contain the 
		number of the rule to be ammended.  It must either contain
		the entire wording of the rule, following its ammendment,
		or quote any portions of the rule to be removed, or words
		to be included.  It must include the position of any addition
		in the text of the ammended rule. 
	 (Repeals a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes an
         existing Rule to cease to exist.
		The body of the proposal must include the number of the 
		rule to be removed from the Set.       
	 (Transmutes a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes a
         Mutable Rule to become Immutable, or vice versa.
		The body after this phrase must contain the number of the 
		rule to be transmuted. 
         (Non-Rules Change: x) or (NRC: x) shall be used when the proposal 
	    seeks to alter the current state of the game, but not of the
	    rules.  The Award of a Patent Title, already described in
	    legislation, is an example of this, where the Declaration
	    would be: (NRC: Award of a Patent Title).  Only phrases 
	    defined in other legislation may be used a substitutes for x.
		The number of the rule which defines the NRC phrase must 
		be included in the body of the proposal.
	 (Other) shall be used if no other Declaration has been
            defined which describes the Proposal.
		The number of the rule affected by this declaration must
		be included in the body of the proposal.

 
      Additional legislation may not define additional legal Declarations
      or change the presentation of the Declaration, save through the 
      ammendment of this Rule.  Additional legislation may, however, 
      define N-RC phrases, without ammending this rule. 

F)    Failure to include the term PROPOSAL:, the name of the 
      Proposer, or a required Rule Number makes the proposal invalid.  

G)      Failure to format correctly is a criminal offence:
        Format Deviation:              Level of Offence:  
        Absence of Title:                               B               
        Absence of Declaration:                         C
        Use of a declaration not defined in this Rule:  A
        Use of an Undefined NRC phrase:                 D         
        Misordering of required Proposal elements       D

H)	Any proposal which has more than 70 characters on a single line, 
	or more than 25 lines, requires a processing fee of two points, 
	to be paid to the Point Reserve.

I)	The brevity of a proposal of 10 or fewer lines is rewarded with
	a point from the Point Reserve, if it passes.  Those lines which
	are blank, or solely contain legally required information, do not
	accrue toward this total.

Default Rules for Officers
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 881 to read:

An Officer is any Player who has been Appointed or Elected to
an Office specified in the Rules. A Judge is not an Officer.
An Officer may be replaced by another Player if a Proposal to
that effect passes.
An Officer may resign at any time, provided e appoints a
successor.
If an Officer resigns while a Proposal is being voted upon to
replace eim, the Player proposed will by eis Successor.

An Officer shall be appointed only if e consents.

This Rule applies to general Offices, and therefore defers to
Rules for specific Offices.

Default Salaries of Officers
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 849 to read:
Officers (excluding Viziers, Ordinancekeepors, and any other
Officers whose duties pertain only to a single Group) shall
receive a salary of 3 Points per week, unless another Rule
explicitly states another salary.

All salaries shall be paid at the beginning of each Nomic week,
on condition that the Officer has been in Office for at least
five days.

The second paragraph of this Rule takes precedence over all
Rules that determine payday differently.

Discourages Too Many Proposals
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 936 to read:
When a player submits a Proposal to the Speaker, e shall lose 1
point for each Proposal proposed by em which either is currently
up for Vote, or has been sent to the Speaker but is not yet
distributed.

The Speaker is responsible for reporting this point change to
the Scorekeepor, and the Speaker shall report it no later than
the time at which the proposal is distributed.

For the purposes of this Rule, multiple proposals in the same
message shall be considered to have been sent to the Speaker
separated by infinitesimal increments of time.

The point change shall not be applied to Players who have made
a Public Mark transfer of 0.5 Marks to the Bank on the same day
as the proposals are submitted, while stating the reason of the
transfer. The occurence of such a transfer shall be mentioned to
the Speaker in the message submitting the Proposals.

****************************************

Final word:

I am *not* distributing proposers' comments along with their
proposals. If they wish to explain themselves to the Voters, then they
can do so in non-official posts at their own leisure.  It's also far
too much hassle for me. 

Michael.

THE CURRENT RULESET

Rules are listed as follows, where NNN represents the Rule number:

========================================

Rule NNN (Immutable or Mutable)
My Own Unofficial Title

NNN.  Semi-Official Rule Title, If There Is One

      Text of Rule

Annotation: Some Rules are annotated as required by Rule 789.
These annotations "shall guide the interpretation
of that Rule."
Relevant Rules: Such annotations include a list of relevant Rules.

[Note: Some Rules are annotated by me to clarify their interpretation.
Unlike the official annotations, these are enclosed in brackets.
These annotations have no legal force in and of themselves.]

========================================



========================================

Rule 101 (Immutable)
Obey the Rules

101.

      All Players must always abide by all the Rules then in effect,
      in the form in which they are then in effect.  The Rules in the
      Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the first game.
      The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (Immutable) and
      201-219 (Mutable).

========================================

Rule 102 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Rules

102.

      Initially Rules in the 100's are Immutable and Rules in the
      200's are Mutable.  Rules subsequently Enacted or Transmuted
      (that is, changed from Immutable to Mutable or vice versa) may
      be Immutable or Mutable regardless of their Numbers, and Rules
      in the Initial Set may be Transmuted regardless of their Numbers.

========================================

Rule 103 (Immutable)
The Speaker and Voters

103.

      At any time, each Player shall be either a Voter or the Speaker;
      no Player may simultaneously be a Voter and a Speaker. At any
      time, there shall be exactly one Speaker. The term "Player" in
      the Rules shall specifically include both the Voters and the
      Speaker.

========================================

Rule 104 (Immutable)
First Speaker

104.

      The Speaker for the first game shall be Michael Norrish.

========================================

Rule 105 (Immutable)
What Is a Rule Change?

105.

      A Rule Change is any of the following:  (1) the enactment,
      repeal, or amendment of a mutable Rule; or (2) the transmutation
      of an immutable Rule into a mutable Rule or vice versa.
        (Note:  This definition implies that, at least initially, all
      new Rules are Mutable; Immutable Rules, as long as they are
      Immutable, may not be Amended or Repealed; Mutable Rules, as long
      as they are Mutable, may be Amended or Repealed; any Rule of any
      status may be Transmuted; no Rule is absolutely immune to change.)

========================================

Rule 106 (Immutable)
Adopting Proposed Rule Changes

106.

      All Rule Changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on.
      They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required
      number of votes and Quorum is achieved.

========================================

Rule 107 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Must Be Written Down

107.

      Any proposed Rule Change must be written down (or otherwise
      communicated in print media) before it is voted on. If adopted,
      it must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.

========================================

Rule 108 (Immutable)
When May Rule Changes Take Effect?

108.

      No Rule Change may take effect earlier than the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording
      explicitly states otherwise.  No rule change may have retroactive
      application.

========================================

Rule 109 (Immutable)
Rule Numbers

109.

      The Speaker shall give each proposed Rule Change a Number for
      reference.  The numbers shall begin with 301, and each Rule
      Change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next
      successive integer, whether or not the Proposal is adopted.
        If a Rule is Repealed and Reenacted, it receives the Number of
      the Proposal to Reenact it.  If a Rule is Amended or Transmuted,
      it receives the Number of the Proposal to Amend or Transmute it.
 
========================================

Rule 110 (Immutable)
Transmutation of Rules

110.

      Rule Changes that Transmute Immutable Rules into Mutable Rules
      may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among Votes
      legally cast.  Transmutation shall not be implied, but must be
      stated explicitly in a Proposal to take effect.
 
========================================

Rule 111 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Conflicts

111.

      In a conflict between a Mutable and an Immutable Rule, the
      immutable Rule takes precedence and the Mutable Rule shall be
      entirely void.  For the purposes of this Rule a Proposal to
      Transmute an Immutable Rule does not "conflict" with that
      Immutable Rule.
 
========================================

Rule 112 (Immutable)
Winning Must Be by Points

112.

      The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered
      from achieving n points to any other state of affairs.  The
      magnitude of n and the means of earning points may be changed,
      and Rules that establish a Winner when play cannot continue may
      be Enacted and (while they are mutable) be Amended or Repealed.
 
========================================

Rule 113 (Immutable)
Players May Always Forfeit

113.

      A Player always has the option to forfeit the Game rather than
      continue to play or incur a Game penalty.  No penalty worse than
      losing, in the judgment of the Player to incur it, may be
      imposed.

========================================

Rule 114 (Immutable)
At Least One Mutable Rule

114.

      There must always be at least one Mutable Rule.  The adoption of
      Rule Changes must never become completely inpermissible.

========================================

Rule 115 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Which Change Rule-Changing Rules Allowed

115.

      Rule Changes that affect Rules needed to allow or apply
      Rule Changes are as permissible as other Rule Changes.  Even
      Rule Changes that amend or repeal their own authority are
      permissible.  No Rule Change or type of move is impermissible
      solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a
      Rule.

========================================

Rule 116 (Immutable)
Permissibility of the Unprohibited

116.

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
      and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
      which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly or
      implicitly permits it.

========================================

Rule 206 (Mutable)
One Voter, One Vote

206.

      Each Voter has exactly one Vote.  The Speaker may not Vote.

========================================

Rule 208 (Mutable)
End of the Voting Period

208.

      At the end of the prescribed Voting Period on a Proposal, the
      Speaker shall reveal all Votes legally cast on that Proposal. If
      the Speaker's consent may be required for a Proposal to be
      adopted then the Speaker should indicate at that time whether or
      not e gives eir consent.  If the Speaker does not explicitly
      indicate that e refuses to consent to the Proposal, it shall be
      assumed that e consents.

      listserver message send by the Benevolent Speaker, announcing
      the result of the vote on the corresponding proposal.

========================================

Rule 388 (Mutable)
Game Status When a New Game Begins

388.  Starting a new Game:

      Whenever a new game of Nomic is begun, the status of the new

      decide otherwise.

========================================

Rule 399 (Mutable)
The Office of the Rulekeepor

========================================

Rule 404 (Mutable)
Legality of Proposals

404.  Legality of Proposals:

      As long as a Proposal satisfies all requirements in place at the
      time of its making for the proper making of Proposals, the act
      of making such a Proposal is legal regardless of its content.
      It is legal to propose a Rule which conflicts with other Rules
      or with itself, which is paradoxical, or which cannot be
      applied.

========================================

Rule 407 (Mutable)
Invoking Judgement

407.  Clerk of the Courts, Part II: Invoking Judgement:

      If Players disagree about the legality of a Move or the
      interpretation or application of a Rule, then a Player may
      invoke Judgement by submitting a Statement for Judgement to the
      Clerk of the Courts.  Disagreement, for the purposes of this
      Rule, may be created by the insistence of any Player.  When
      Judgement is invoked, the Clerk of the Courts must, as soon as
      possible, select a Judge as described in the Rules.  The Clerk
      of the Courts must then distribute the Statement to be judged,
      along with the identity of the Judge, to all Players.

========================================

Rule 408 (Mutable)
Accepting Judge-ship

408.  Clerk of the Courts, Part III: Accepting Judge-ship:

      After the Clerk of the Courts has distributed the Statement to
      be judged and the identity of the Judge, the Judge has one week
      in which to deliver a legal Judgement.  If the Judge fails to
      deliver a Judgement within this time, e is penalized 10 points
      and a new Judge is selected.  A Judgement is delivered by
      submitting that Judgement to the Clerk of the Courts, who must
      then distribute that Judgement to all Players as soon as
      possible.

========================================

Rule 413 (Mutable)
Winning by Paradox

413.  Winning By Paradox:

      If the Rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or
      if the legality of some action cannot be determined with
      finality, or if some action appears equally legal and illegal,
      then a player may Call For Judgement on a Statement to that
      effect.  If the Statement is judged TRUE, then the same Judge
      who judged the Statement TRUE must declare the most recent
      passed Proposal X such that the Statement was not TRUE before
      the passage of Proposal X, or declare that there is no such
      Proposal.  (Until the Judge does this, the Judgment is not
      valid.)  If the Judgement of TRUE is not overruled, then the
      Player who called for Judgement is declared the Winner of the
      game.
      
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared that
      there is no such Proposal X, the game is ended, with no
      provisions for restarting it.
      
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared such
      a Proposal X, the following actions are taken:
         - all Players remain active,
         - all Proposals curently being Voted upon are removed from
           consideration for Voting,
         - the scores for all Players are set to 0 (zero),
         - the Rules and explicit game custom are reverted to the
           state they were in before Proposal X was passed,
         - a Benevolent Speaker for the next Game is chosen:
              -If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the
               Benevolent Speaker, and the old Benevolent Speaker
               becomes a Voter,
              -If there is more than one Winner, the Benevolent
               Speaker randomly selects one of the Winners, who
               becomes the new Benevolent Speaker, and the old
               Benevolent Speaker becomes a Voter,
         - and a new Game is begun.

========================================

Rule 415 (Mutable)
How To Submit a Proposal

415.  "How a Proposal is Submitted":

      A Proposal by a Voter shall be made by submitting it to the
      Mighty Speaker. As soon as possible after receiving the
      Proposal, the Mighty Speaker shall assign the Proposal a Number
      and distribute the Proposal along with its number to all
      Players.
      
      The Mighty Speaker may also make Proposals. The Mighty Speaker
      must process all pending Voter-submitted Proposals first, and
      may then Process Proposals of the Mighty Speaker, assigning
      these Proposals a number and distributing them in the same
      fashion as any other Proposal.

Rules are listed as follows, where NNN represents the Rule number:

========================================

Rule NNN (Immutable or Mutable)
My Own Unofficial Title

NNN.  Semi-Official Rule Title, If There Is One

      Text of Rule

Annotation: Some Rules are annotated as required by Rule 789.
These annotations "shall guide the interpretation
of that Rule."
Relevant Rules: Such annotations include a list of relevant Rules.

[Note: Some Rules are annotated by me to clarify their interpretation.
Unlike the official annotations, these are enclosed in brackets.
These annotations have no legal force in and of themselves.]

========================================



========================================

Rule 101 (Immutable)
Obey the Rules

101.

      All Players must always abide by all the Rules then in effect,
      in the form in which they are then in effect.  The Rules in the
      Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the first game.
      The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (Immutable) and
      201-219 (Mutable).

========================================

Rule 102 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Rules

102.

      Initially Rules in the 100's are Immutable and Rules in the
      200's are Mutable.  Rules subsequently Enacted or Transmuted
      (that is, changed from Immutable to Mutable or vice versa) may
      be Immutable or Mutable regardless of their Numbers, and Rules
      in the Initial Set may be Transmuted regardless of their Numbers.

========================================

Rule 103 (Immutable)
The Speaker and Voters

103.

      At any time, each Player shall be either a Voter or the Speaker;
      no Player may simultaneously be a Voter and a Speaker. At any
      time, there shall be exactly one Speaker. The term "Player" in
      the Rules shall specifically include both the Voters and the
      Speaker.

========================================

Rule 104 (Immutable)
First Speaker

104.

      The Speaker for the first game shall be Michael Norrish.

========================================

Rule 105 (Immutable)
What Is a Rule Change?

105.

      A Rule Change is any of the following:  (1) the enactment,
      repeal, or amendment of a mutable Rule; or (2) the transmutation
      of an immutable Rule into a mutable Rule or vice versa.
        (Note:  This definition implies that, at least initially, all
      new Rules are Mutable; Immutable Rules, as long as they are
      Immutable, may not be Amended or Repealed; Mutable Rules, as long
      as they are Mutable, may be Amended or Repealed; any Rule of any
      status may be Transmuted; no Rule is absolutely immune to change.)

========================================

Rule 106 (Immutable)
Adopting Proposed Rule Changes

106.

      All Rule Changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on.
      They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required
      number of votes and Quorum is achieved.

========================================

Rule 107 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Must Be Written Down

107.

      Any proposed Rule Change must be written down (or otherwise
      communicated in print media) before it is voted on. If adopted,
      it must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.

========================================

Rule 108 (Immutable)
When May Rule Changes Take Effect?

108.

      No Rule Change may take effect earlier than the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording
      explicitly states otherwise.  No rule change may have retroactive
      application.

========================================

Rule 109 (Immutable)
Rule Numbers

109.

      The Speaker shall give each proposed Rule Change a Number for
      reference.  The numbers shall begin with 301, and each Rule
      Change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next
      successive integer, whether or not the Proposal is adopted.
        If a Rule is Repealed and Reenacted, it receives the Number of
      the Proposal to Reenact it.  If a Rule is Amended or Transmuted,
      it receives the Number of the Proposal to Amend or Transmute it.
 
========================================

Rule 110 (Immutable)
Transmutation of Rules

110.

      Rule Changes that Transmute Immutable Rules into Mutable Rules
      may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among Votes
      legally cast.  Transmutation shall not be implied, but must be
      stated explicitly in a Proposal to take effect.
 
========================================

Rule 111 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Conflicts

111.

      In a conflict between a Mutable and an Immutable Rule, the
      immutable Rule takes precedence and the Mutable Rule shall be
      entirely void.  For the purposes of this Rule a Proposal to
      Transmute an Immutable Rule does not "conflict" with that
      Immutable Rule.
 
========================================

Rule 112 (Immutable)
Winning Must Be by Points

112.

      The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered
      from achieving n points to any other state of affairs.  The
      magnitude of n and the means of earning points may be changed,
      and Rules that establish a Winner when play cannot continue may
      be Enacted and (while they are mutable) be Amended or Repealed.
 
========================================

Rule 113 (Immutable)
Players May Always Forfeit

113.

      A Player always has the option to forfeit the Game rather than
      continue to play or incur a Game penalty.  No penalty worse than
      losing, in the judgment of the Player to incur it, may be
      imposed.

========================================

Rule 114 (Immutable)
At Least One Mutable Rule

114.

      There must always be at least one Mutable Rule.  The adoption of
      Rule Changes must never become completely inpermissible.

========================================

Rule 115 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Which Change Rule-Changing Rules Allowed

115.

      Rule Changes that affect Rules needed to allow or apply
      Rule Changes are as permissible as other Rule Changes.  Even
      Rule Changes that amend or repeal their own authority are
      permissible.  No Rule Change or type of move is impermissible
      solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a
      Rule.

========================================

Rule 116 (Immutable)
Permissibility of the Unprohibited

116.

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
      and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
      which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly or
      implicitly permits it.

========================================

Rule 206 (Mutable)
One Voter, One Vote

206.

      Each Voter has exactly one Vote.  The Speaker may not Vote.

========================================

Rule 208 (Mutable)
End of the Voting Period

208.

      At the end of the prescribed Voting Period on a Proposal, the
      Speaker shall reveal all Votes legally cast on that Proposal. If
      the Speaker's consent may be required for a Proposal to be
      adopted then the Speaker should indicate at that time whether or
      not e gives eir consent.  If the Speaker does not explicitly
      indicate that e refuses to consent to the Proposal, it shall be
      assumed that e consents.

========================================

Rule 212 (Mutable)
Resolving Rule Conflicts

212.

      If two or more Mutable Rules conflict with one another, or if
      two or more Immutable Rules conflict with one another, then the
      Rule with the lowest ordinal Number takes precedence.
        If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of rule) or takes
      precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.
        If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

========================================

Rule 217 (Mutable)
Judgements Must Accord with the Rules

217.

      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however, if
      the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the Statement
      to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider Game Custom and the
      Spirit of the Game before applying other standards.

========================================

      Period.

      An adopted rule change takes full effect at the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it.
      The moment of the completion of the vote is defined by the date
      and time given in the line starting with "Date:" of the Nomic
      listserver message send by the Benevolent Speaker, announcing
      the result of the vote on the corresponding proposal.

========================================

Rule 388 (Mutable)
Game Status When a New Game Begins

388.  Starting a new Game:

      Whenever a new game of Nomic is begun, the status of the new
      Game when it begins shall be the same as the status of the old
      Game when it ended, in all respects where the Rules do not
      decide otherwise.

========================================

Rule 399 (Mutable)
The Office of the Rulekeepor

399.  The Office of the Rulekeepor:

      Let there be an Officer known as the Rulekeepor.
      The Rulekeepor shall maintain a complete list of the current
      Rules, and post this list to all Players at least once a week.
      
      So long as the Rulekeepor is in Office, the Speaker is not
      required to maintain or distribute the Rules.

========================================

Rule 402 (Mutable)
Transfer of Power of the Mighty Speaker

402.  Transfer of Power of the Mighty Speaker:

      When one Mighty Speaker is yielding his Office to another, the
      following procedure shall be followed:

          listserv announcing the official transfer of power, which
          occurs at the "Date:" of the Present Mighty Speaker's
          posting.
      
      The Present Mighty Speaker remains in Office until the successful
      completion of step 3.

========================================

Rule 404 (Mutable)
Legality of Proposals

404.  Legality of Proposals:

      As long as a Proposal satisfies all requirements in place at the
      time of its making for the proper making of Proposals, the act
      of making such a Proposal is legal regardless of its content.
      It is legal to propose a Rule which conflicts with other Rules
      or with itself, which is paradoxical, or which cannot be
      applied.

========================================

Rule 407 (Mutable)
Invoking Judgement

407.  Clerk of the Courts, Part II: Invoking Judgement:

      If Players disagree about the legality of a Move or the
      interpretation or application of a Rule, then a Player may
      invoke Judgement by submitting a Statement for Judgement to the
      Clerk of the Courts.  Disagreement, for the purposes of this
      Rule, may be created by the insistence of any Player.  When
      Judgement is invoked, the Clerk of the Courts must, as soon as
      possible, select a Judge as described in the Rules.  The Clerk
      of the Courts must then distribute the Statement to be judged,
      along with the identity of the Judge, to all Players.

      and a new Judge is selected.  A Judgement is delivered by
      submitting that Judgement to the Clerk of the Courts, who must
      then distribute that Judgement to all Players as soon as
      possible.

========================================

Rule 413 (Mutable)
Winning by Paradox

413.  Winning By Paradox:

      If the Rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or
      if the legality of some action cannot be determined with
      finality, or if some action appears equally legal and illegal,
      then a player may Call For Judgement on a Statement to that
      effect.  If the Statement is judged TRUE, then the same Judge
      who judged the Statement TRUE must declare the most recent
      passed Proposal X such that the Statement was not TRUE before
      the passage of Proposal X, or declare that there is no such
      Proposal.  (Until the Judge does this, the Judgment is not
      valid.)  If the Judgement of TRUE is not overruled, then the
      Player who called for Judgement is declared the Winner of the
      game.
      
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared that
      there is no such Proposal X, the game is ended, with no
      provisions for restarting it.
      
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared such
      a Proposal X, the following actions are taken:

           consideration for Voting,
         - the scores for all Players are set to 0 (zero),
         - the Rules and explicit game custom are reverted to the
           state they were in before Proposal X was passed,
         - a Benevolent Speaker for the next Game is chosen:
              -If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the
               Benevolent Speaker, and the old Benevolent Speaker
               becomes a Voter,
              -If there is more than one Winner, the Benevolent
               Speaker randomly selects one of the Winners, who
               becomes the new Benevolent Speaker, and the old
               Benevolent Speaker becomes a Voter,
         - and a new Game is begun.

========================================

Rule 415 (Mutable)
How To Submit a Proposal

415.  "How a Proposal is Submitted":

      A Proposal by a Voter shall be made by submitting it to the
      Mighty Speaker. As soon as possible after receiving the
      Proposal, the Mighty Speaker shall assign the Proposal a Number
      and distribute the Proposal along with its number to all
      Players.
      
      The Mighty Speaker may also make Proposals. The Mighty Speaker
      must process all pending Voter-submitted Proposals first, and
      may then Process Proposals of the Mighty Speaker, assigning
      these Proposals a number and distributing them in the same
      fashion as any other Proposal.

========================================

Rule 417 (Mutable)
The Nomic Archivist

417.  Establishment of the Office of Archivist:

      That there be established an office known as the Nomic
      Archivist, which shall be governed by the default Rules
      concerning official posts. The initial duties of the Nomic
      Archivist shall be to record the passage and failure of
      Proposals, to maintain a "historical record" (defined below)
      of the Ruleset, to maintain a list of Judgements and their case
      histories, and to maintain a list of game Winners in past games.
      The Archivist is free to comment on the historical records as
      they see fit, but such commentary must be clearly delimited
      from the historical material. Where the material being stored
      does not already admit a classification method, the Archivist
      is free to design one themselves.

      The "historical record" of the Ruleset maintained by the
      Archivist is one that includes all rules ever part of the nomic
      Ruleset, annotated with information as to their ultimate fate,
      whether Repealed or Amended etc. This record of the Ruleset has
      no legal force.

      The duties required of the Archivist may be changed with their
      consent and at the request of the Office's controlling body
      (whatsoever that may be). Initially, the controlling body of
      this Office shall be all Players, and any request to change the
      duties must therefore be supported by a majority of Players
      "speaking" to the request.  Naturally, default Rules for
      Offices may establish a different controlling body for this
      Office.
      
      The salary of the Archivist office shall be determined by its
      controlling body. Initially, its salary shall be 5 points and
      one coin of the office-holder's group per week.
      
      The initial office-holder for this post shall be Michael
      Norrish.

========================================

Rule 450 (Mutable)
Game Entities May Not Be Arbitrarily Changed

450.  Game Entities may not be Arbitrarily Changed:

      Any Entity which is created by the Nomic Rules, and which exists only
      within the context of the current Game of Nomic, such as Points,
      Votes, etc. may *not* be changed by any action other than those
      specified by the Rules.

========================================

Rule 451 (Mutable)
Determination of Judgement--Timing

451.  Timing of CFJ Results:

      When a CFJ makes a Statement about the current state of the
      Game, the result of that CFJ shall be TRUE if and only if the
      Judge feels that that Statement was correct at the time that the
      CFJ was *issued*. Any changes that have happened in the time
      between the issuing of the CFJ and its delivery must be figured
      in to find the correct current state.

========================================

Rule 452 (Mutable)
Prohibition of Electioneering by the Mighty Speaker

452.  Prohibition of Electioneering by the Mighty Speaker:

      The Speaker may not use eis knowledge of the current status of a
      vote on a Proposal in an attempt to influence the result of the
      Vote on that Proposal. Violations of this Rule shall be
      considered a Class C Crime.

========================================

Rule 455 (Mutable)
Penalty for Improper or Lacking Declarations

455.  Further Declaration Rules:

      Any Player who submits a Proposal which does not include a
      Declaration, as described in other legislation, shall be guilty
      of a Class C Crime.  Any Player who submits a Proposal which
      includes a Declaration which has not been approved by
      legislation shall be guilty of a Class A Crime.

========================================

Rule 457 (Mutable)
Voting of the ex-Speaker

457.  Voting of the ex-Speaker:

      If a Player ceases to be the Speaker, and then becomes a Voter,

      addressed in the corresponding judgement.

      If any Player believes that an Injunction or any part of it does
      not meet the criteria for a valid Injunction, e may submit a CFJ
      to that effect. If the resulting Judgement supports the
      contention that the criteria are not met, the Injunction shall
      be considered illegal and shall have no legal force.

      state. The adjustments to the game state must have been
      unambiguously specified within the CFJ, and these adjustments
      must only undo actions which were a direct or indirect result of
      that Move.

      transfer.

      All Nomic Entities shall abide by the above limits whenever
      Points are traded.  If a Nomic Entity must trade Points by the

Rule 724 (Mutable)
Winning the Game

724.  Requirements for Winning

      The Winner is the first Voter to achieve sufficiently many
      Points.  The minimum number of Points required for Player X to
      win is 10*N*(1+G/6), where N is the number of Players currently
      registered in the Game, and G is the number of Games which
      Player X has already won.  If more than one Voter achieves this
      condition simultaneously, then all such Voters win.  When a Game
      ends in this manner:
        - If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the new
          Speaker and the old Speaker becomes a Voter.
        - If there is more than one Winner, the Voter with the highest Point 
          total becomes the new Speaker.  If more than one Voter is
          tied for the highest score, the old Speaker randomly selects
          one of them to become the new Speaker.  The old Speaker
          becomes a voter.
        - All Player's scores are reset to 0.
        - A new Game is begun.  All Rules and Proposals retain the
          status they had at the end of the old Game.

      shall be compensated with half the price in Marks that this
      Player paid for the Stock X.
      These Marks shall come from the account of Player X, *before*
      those shall be destroyed, as required by other Rules.
      If there are not enough Marks available, the deficit shall be
      paid by the Bank.

Rule 736 (Mutable)
The Marxist

736.  The Marxist

      Let there be the Patent Title known as "Marxist", which is
      awarded to the Player with the most Marks, or if tied, to the
      Players with the most Marks. Only the current richest Player
      or Players may hold this title.

      The determination and announcement of assignment and revoking
      of the Title is made by the Banker, who must use the most
      accurate means of determining this available to eim, and must
      make the announcement as soon as possible after becoming aware
      of a change in holder of the Title.

      However: To respect some Players' wish for privacy, and in
      view of the secret nature of Marks accounts, a prospective
      Marxist must first be asked if e wants the Title. If not, then
      instead of announcing, "Player x is granted the Patent Title of
      'Marxist', e announces, "Patent Title of 'Marxist' is granted
       to an anonymous Player".

      states such. A Conserved Quantity may only be Created or
      Destroyed as explicitly stated by the Rules. If a Conserved
      Quantity is given to an Entity, and no Rule states where that
      Conserved Quantity is to be taken from, then the transfer shall
      not take place. If a Conserved Quantity is taken from an Entity,
      and no Rule states where that Conserved Quantity is to be
      transfered to, then the Conserved Quantity shall be transfered
      to the Bank.

========================================

Rule 748 (Mutable)
Don't Count Blank or Required Lines in Proposal Length

748.  Whitespace in a Rule

      Whenever the length of a Proposal is determined, any blank lines
      within that Proposal shall not be counted towards the number of
      lines in that Prthe Nomic
      Archivist, which shall be governed by the default Rules
      concerning official posts. The initial duties of the Nomic
      Archivist shall be to record the passage and failure of
      Proposals, to maintain a "historical record" (defined below)
      of the Ruleset, to maintain a list of Judgements and their case
      histories, and to maintain a list of game Winners in past games.
      The Archivist is free to comment on the historical records as
      they see fit, but such commentary must be clearly delimited
      from the historical material. Where the material being stored
      does not already admit a classification method, the Archivist
      is free to design one themselves.

      The "historical record" of the Ruleset maintained by the
      Archivist is one that includes all rules ever part of the nomic
      Ruleset, annotated with information as to their ultimate fate,
      whether Repealed or Amended etc. This record of the Ruleset has
      no legal force.

      The duties required of the Archivist may be changed with their
      consent and at the request of the Office's controlling body
      (whatsoever that may be). Initially, the controlling body of
      this Office shall be all Players, and any request to change the
      duties must therefore be supported by a majority of Players
      "speaking" to the request.  Naturally, default Rules for
      Offices may establish a different controlling body for this
      Office.
      
      The salary of the Archivist office shall be determined by its
      controlling body. Initially, its salary shall be 5 points and
      one coin of the office-holder's group per week.
      
      The initial office-holder for this post shall be Michael
      Norrish.

      must be published with the Judgement. All players must abide by
      the Injunction beginning no later than 72 hours after its
      publication unless one of the following conditions then apply:
        - The Judgement which the Injunction accompanies is undergoing
          appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of the appeal
          process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but a proposal
          has been published which would overturn that decision if
          passed, and said proposal has not failed.
        - The validity of the Injunction itself is questioned by a
          pending CFJ.
        - A Judgement upholding the validity of the Injunction is
          undergoing appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of
          the appeal process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but
          a proposal has been published which would overturn that
          decision if passed, and said proposal has not failed.

      A Judgement may not be accompanied by an Injunction unless it is
      specifically permitted elsewhere in the rules. An Injunction
      must be completely consistent with all rules in effect at the
      time of issuance, and must be completely relevant to the matter
      addressed in the corresponding judgement.

      If any Player believes that an Injunction or any part of it does
      not meet the criteria for a valid Injunction, e may submit a CFJ
      to that effect. If the resulting Judgement supports the
      contention that the criteria are not met, the Injunction shall
      be considered illegal and shall have no legal force.

      state. The adjustments to the game state must have been
      unambiguously specified within the CFJ, and these adjustments
      must only undo actions which were a direct or indirect result of
      that Move.

Rule 724 (Mutable)
Winning the Game

724.  Requirements for Winning

      The Winner is the first Voter to achieve sufficiently many
      Points.  The minimum number of Points required for Player X to
      win is 10*N*(1+G/6), where N is the number of Players currently
      registered in the Game, and G is the number of Games which
      Player X has already won.  If more than one Voter achieves this
      condition simultaneously, then all such Voters win.  When a Game
      ends in this manner:
        - If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the new
          Speaker and the old Speaker becomes a Voter.
        - If there is more than one Winner, the Voter with the highest Point 
          total becomes the new Speaker.  If more than one Voter is
          tied for the highest score, the old Speaker randomly selects
          one of them to become the new Speaker.  The old Speaker
          becomes a voter.
        - All Player's scores are reset to 0.
        - A new Game is begun.  All Rules and Proposals retain the
          status they had at the end of the old Game.

Rule 728 (Mutable)
Destruction of and Compensation for Stocks of Leaving Players

728.  Stocks of leaving Players I

      When Player X leaves the game, Stock X shall be destroyed.
      If Stock X was held at that time by another Player, this Player
      shall be compensated with half the price in Marks that this
      Player paid for the Stock X.
      These Marks shall come from the account of Player X, *before*
      those shall be destroyed, as required by other Rules.
      If there are not enough Marks available, the deficit shall be
      paid by the Bank.

      The proceedings shall go to Player X, unless they obtain their
      own Stock, in which case the proceedings shall go to the Bank.

Rule 736 (Mutable)
The Marxist

736.  The Marxist

      Let there be the Patent Title known as "Marxist", which is
      awarded to the Player with the most Marks, or if tied, to the
      Players with the most Marks. Only the current richest Player
      or Players may hold this title.

      The determination and announcement of assignment and revoking
      of the Title is made by the Banker, who must use the most
      accurate means of determining this available to eim, and must
      make the announcement as soon as possible after becoming aware
      of a change in holder of the Title.

      However: To respect some Players' wish for privacy, and in
      view of the secret nature of Marks accounts, a prospective
      Marxist must first be asked if e wants the Title. If not, then
      instead of announcing, "Player x is granted the Patent Title of
      'Marxist', e announces, "Patent Title of 'Marxist' is granted
       to an anonymous Player".

      Destroyed as explicitly stated by the Rules. If a Conserved
      Quantity is given to an Entity, and no Rule states where that
      Conserved Quantity is to be taken from, then the transfer shall
      not take place. If a Conserved Quantity is taken from an Entity,
      and no Rule states where that Conserved Quantity is to be
      transfered to, then the Conserved Quantity shall be transfered
      to the Bank.

      Players who wish to participate in the Auction then must
      indicate their interest by sending a bid to the Auctioneer.

      Any Player or Group X may perform an Act of Mischief directed

      are defined in other Rules; such definitions must include a 
      positive Price in Coins, or the form of Mischief is not
      permissible.  This Rule explicitly takes precedence over all
      other Rules which purport to determine which forms of Mischief
      are permissible.

      To cause an Act of Mischief,  X  sends to the Public Forum a
      message containing:
      - the Name of the object, Y;
      - the effect of the Act of Mischief;

      - indication of which Coins in X's account will be used as
      payment for the Act of Mischief.  Coins of Group Y, or the
      Group to which Player Y belongs, may not be used as payment.  

      The effect of the Act of Mischief is applied immediately upon 
      publication of the above message in the Forum.  An additional
      effect of this Act of Mischief is that
      - for each Coin of Group Z spent as payment above, two Points
      are removed from the Z Treasury;
      - the Coins used as payment above are removed from X's account
      and destroyed.

Rule 766 (Mutable)
Groups

766.  Amend Rule 714.

      A Group is initially formed by a set of Players which has
      registered with the Registrar to form a Group; other Players may
      join later.  Each Group has a Name, a Membership, a Vizier,
      an Ordinancekeepor, a Treasury, an Initial Set of Ordinances,
      and an associated form of Currency, called the <name> Coins,
      where <name> is the Name of the Group.

      1.  The Name may not be the Name of another Group.

      2.  The Membership is a set of Players;  these Players are
      Members of the Group, and all other Players are not.

      3.  Synchronously with the registration of a Group, two Offices
      are created known as the <name> Vizier, and the <name>
      Ordinancekeepor, where <name> is the Name of the Group.
      These Offices may never be empty, and the <name> Vizier and
      <name> Ordinancekeepor must both be a member of <name> Group.
      The <name> Vizier shall inform the Registrar whenever the
      Membership or the Ordinancekeepor of the <name> group changes.
      When the <name> Vizier changes, the new Vizier shall inform the
      Registrar of the change.
      The <name> Ordinancekeepor shall keep an accurate and current
      record of the Ordinances of the <name> Group.

      4.  The Treasury is a repository for Points and Currencies and
      has the same capabilities for holding, trading, and spending
      Points and Currencies as does a Player.

      5.  The Ordinances are a description of the operation of the
      Group.

      6.  The <name> Coins are a form of Currency which is created
      synchronously with the registration of the Group.  The <name>
      Group may create <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be
      placed in the <name> Treasury.  The <name> Group may destroy
      <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be removed from the
      <name> Treasury.

      E must inform both the Banker and the Speaker when doing so.
      A Proposal which has Sanity imposed upon it is known as a Sane
      Proposal.  The Speaker shall, when e distributes a Sane
      Proposal, inform the Players that it is a Sane Proposal.

      No non-Voter Nomic entity may Vote on a Sane Proposal.  Each
      Voter shall have exactly one Vote on a Sane Proposal, and
      each Voter's Vote shall be counted exactly once on a Sane
      Proposal.

      This rule takes precedence over any rule allowing a non-Voter
      Nomic entity to Vote; over any rule which gives any Voter
      more or less than one Vote on a proposal; and over any

      If the Speaker has abandoned eir post, another new, Temporary
      Speaker is selected according to the "Rules of Succession", or
      if no such rules are defined, the other Player not on hold with
      the highest Score becomes the temporary Speaker.  This does not
      force the Game to be over in this case, and Scores are not reset
      to 0. The Game continues until a Player Wins, at which time a
      new Game is begun and the Winner becomes the real Speaker. The
      Temporary Speaker shall make reasonable effort to obtain the
      former Speaker's materials: proposal queue, voting records, etc.
      but if this is not possible, then the Temporary Speaker shall
      request that these be resubmitted by the Players. If a Speaker
      is replaced in this manner, e has eir score set to minus 2N
      Points immediately, where N is the number of Points required for
      a Player to Win the Game.

      Abandonment is determined as follows: If any Player suspects
      that the Speaker has Abandoned, e sends a message to all Players
      calling on the Speaker to announce eir presence.  The Speaker
      must reply to all Players within one week; if e does not, e is

      within three days of the Abandonment or resignation of the
      Speaker.  The old Speaker may not send such a message.  This
      message shall be sent to the Speaker, in the case of a Speaker
      voluntarily giving up his position; or to the first Player who
      called for the Speaker to announce his presence, in the case of
      an Abandoned Speaker.

      After three days, the Player ranking highest on the list
      of succession, out of those who indicated a willingness to
      become Speaker, shall become Speaker.

Rule 789 (Mutable)
Injunctions on Interpretations of Rules

789.  Injunction: Interpretation of a Rule

      When a player makes a CFJ alleging that a Rule should be
      interpreted in a certain way, e shall also submit a list of
      Rules relevant to that CFJ, which must include the Rule in
      question.  If the statement is Judged TRUE, the Judge may
      include with the Judgement an Injuction requiring the Rulekeepor
      to annotate the Rule in question with the Statement in the CFJ
      and the list of relevant Rules.

      The annotation shall remain only until one of the Rules
      in the list of relevant Rules is amended, repealed, or
      transmuted; or until a CFJ determines that the injunction no
      longer applies, as described below.  While it remains, it shall
      guide the application of that Rule.

      If a Player believes that the circumstances which led to the
      Judgement no longer prevail and the annotation is therefore no
      longer applicable, e may submit a CFJ to that effect. If it is
      Judged TRUE, the annotation shall be stricken from the rule set.

I received the Judgments on CFJ 667 (Judge Steve) and 668 (Judge Coren).
However, the Judgments seem to be mutually exclusive, in the sense
that: if Judgment 667 is legal, than 668 is illegal or vice versa.

Now, an illegal Judgment of course is not a Judgment. Therefore one
of these two Players has to redo its copy and make it legal.
As I can not determine, which one is the legal one, I can not distribute
the Judgments to the Players. For the moment.

No problem: 408 requires me to distribute those Judgments `as soon as
possible'. Well, for the moment such a distribution is not possible.

Michael,
did you get my message about the fact that I *did* vote on
my own proposals 961-963?
As it would mean the 961 (Cure the Mark deadlock) passes instead of
fails, I think the matter *is* important.

(Pfoei, you make them Speaker and then, suddenly, they start to ignore
you   :-)

Stella?

===Included message===
Dear Michael,

I did vote on my own proposals, at a time when David was still the
legal Speaker. I even put some Points on the vototron.

Here's the message:

Date:         Mon, 25 Jul 94 19:08:46 SET
From:         KUNNE@CERNVM.cern.ch
Subject:      Votes and a problem...
To:           dmb@ironwood.cray.com


Dear David,

there is a problem with Proposal 964:
Steve tries to repeal a Rule that no longer exist. It was already
repealed by Proposal 949.
Hence, I think 964 is *not* a proposal, because of 105.

As for the 3 point penalty: I agree. Iwill correct it on the next
iteration of the score report: I think today's score report will
be attacked in any case.

I hope you don't mind Michael and I put an end to your Speakerhood
by Brute Force?

As for the moment you're still acting, here are my votes:

FOR: 961, 962, 963, 965
AGAINST: 964 (if a Proposal)

I also put 2.1 Points on the 961 FOR Cache and 1.1 Points each
on 962 and 963.

Greetings,
Ronald

Just so people know I've not disappeared without a trace...  Soon-ish (sometime 
this week) I'll be going on hold, seeing that I'm moving to California 
(hahahaha! no more New Mexico!!!!!!!) and will subsequently be losing internet 
access for a time.  Distributor, please take me off the Official distribution
list sometime before friday (the 5th) this week.  Registrar, please note in the 
phone books that my current email address will no longer be valid.  Hopefully
I'll find a workable account there within the month, but there's no promises 
when I'll be back.  My current email address will be valid up through friday,
but after then I won't recieve any mail sent there (obviously).  I'll
post a message before I leave... :)


Have fun!

Grei and Seth did not do their civic duty and lose 43*10=430 and
35*10=350 Points respectively for not judging their batch in time.
They are no longer eligible as Judge (Rule 503)
(Maybe it's time to check if these Players are still with us??)

Their batch was reassigned over the eligible Players.
This was the number that every Player got:
ALICE      5
BOWEN      6
CHUCK      3
COREN      6
ChrisM     5
FNORD.     5

MEPHIST    6

NICOL      8

============================== Agora Digest, 8/01/94
==============================

===== New Rules =====

===== Proposals =====

* Timothy Proposed Repealing Rules: 
    597 (Proposals have to have Titles),
    912 ("Award a Patent Title" and "Run for Office" are legal declarations)
    455 (Proposals have to have Declarations)
    637 (Format of proposals to Amend a Rule)
    659 (Lose points for long proposals, get a point for short proposals)

    His new rule basically joins these into one, with a few changes.

* Stella? proposed adding to Rule 881 the phrase "An Officer shall be
appointed only if e consents."

* Stella? proposed adding the phrase "All salaries shall be paid at the
beginning of each Nomic week, on condition that the Officer has been in
Office for at least five days." to Rule 849, along with some minor changes in
language.

* Stella? proposed changing Rule 936 (Discourages too many Rules) so that
Players could get around the point loss by paying 0.5 Marks to the Bank when
submitting the proposals.

===== Proto-Proposals =====

* Garth made some changes on the proto-Proposal for Mutability Indexes.
Changing a Mutability Index is now a Rule Change, with the declaration
(Mutates a Rule).

* Garth also (!!) proto-Proposed the Nomic Dictionary. The Dictionary would
be maintained by the Rulekeepor, and definitions would take precedence over
Mutable Rules.

===== Ideas =====

* Chuck pointed out a loophole in the proto-Proposal for Precedence of Oaths
which makes ANY oath easy to get around. (Swear an oath that you will obey
all of your Oaths designated as Emergency Oath. Then, any time you want to
get around a previous oath, just swear another Oath to the opposite effect
and designate it an Emergency Oath.)

* Garth went through the Ruleset, counting terms that are candidates for
inclusion in the Dictionary; he found 127. 

===== CFJ's =====

* The CotC said that, while he has received judgements for CFJ's 667 and 668,
the judgements are mutually exclusive. For this reason, he has not posted the
judgements themselves, although he did say that they are both TRUE.

* Fnord issued judgement on his CFJ batch, all False (except for one without
a Statement.)

* Grei and Seth didn't judge their batch of CFJ's. They were distributed to
other players.

===== Oaths =====

===== Other News =====

* Correction from 7/30/94 Digest: Several of the Stock Reform proto-Proposals
were sent in by Lance. Sorry for the oversight.

* Timothy mentioned that he had a possible automatic-win scam designed, and
is discussing it with PROSIRUP.

* I am now issuing the Digest in both text-only and HTML (WWW) forms. Both
versions will be posted at least once per week.

* Chuck is going On Hold. He appointed Coren as the new Registrar,
Rulekeepor, and Justiciar.

* Alice will also be leaving soon, since she's moving to California. She'll
be back whenever she can get access to the Internet.

We would like to proto-Propose the following Rule:

PROPOSAL

Votes for Marks:
(Creates a Rule)

The Bank shall have the power to cast Votes FOR or AGAINST any Proposal.
If any Entity transfers 2 Marks to the Bank, and indicates that the two
Marks are to be used exclusively for the purpose of influencing Bank
Votes, then the Bank shall cast one Vote as dictated by the Entity who
transfered 2 Marks to the Bank. Any number of Votes may be cast in this
manner, but 2 Marks must be transfered to the Bank for each Vote.

This Rule is intended to alleviate the Marks flow problems by giving 
them value, and by encouraging Players (and other Entities) to transfer
them to the Bank. This (last) paragraph shall be deleted from this
Rule immediately after it becomes a Rule, since it serves no purpose
other than to insure that the reasons for the Proposal contained herein 
shall actually be distributed with the Proposal, in spite of the current 
Speaker's misgivings.... <grumble>

Some Players convinced that I am allowed to send out the judgments
on CFJ667 and CFJ668. Be it so.

As to the argument that I am not allowed to hold up distribution:
I think I may. Suppose somebody returns the following judgment on
CFJ 999:

Judgment: Blurp.

Rather illegal, isn't it? Hence Judgment has not been send to
me and I have nothing to distribute.

The same goes for CFJ667 and CFJ668. If one of them would have been
illegal, I don't think that I am obliged to distribute such a nonsense
Judgment.

Anyway....
Steven receives 5 Points for timely Judgment on CFJ 667.

CotC
From: Mr S L Gardner <gardner@aurora.cc.monash.edu.au>
Date: Mon, 1 Aug 1994 14:47:29 +1000 (EST)

Stella, here is my Judgement on CFJ 667:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
CFJ667 Submitter: WES  Judge: STEVE

Statement:
"We claim a Win by Paradox, as per Rule 413. We claim that for us to send
a message to the listserv containing the word "Freakish" at any time
during the week following the Judgement of this Call for Judgement is
equally Legan and Illegal."

Our Arguments are as follows:

We have made an Oath to perform the aforementioned action, and another Oath
not to perform the aforementioned action. Both of these Oaths were sent to
Stella? in the same message as this Call for Judgement, and both Oaths
refer to the week following this Call for Judgement.

Rule 853, paragraph two, states: "If someone makes an Oath, e must do that
which e has sworn to do, as long as it is legal for em to do so."

As we have sworn to perform the aforementioned action, and have also sworn
NOT to perform the aforementioned action, and Rule 853 therefore requires
us to both perform, and not to perform this action, that the action is
therefore equally legal and illegal.

Therefore, we hereby claim that we shall Win by Paradox according to
Rule 413.

We would also suggest that the Judge consider that Rule 853 is the Rule
which is responsible for creating this Paradox, and point out that such
a determination would result in all Rules and explicit Game Custom to
be reset to immediately before Rule 853, NOT ending the Game. Although
Scores would be reset to 0, and all Proposals currently being Voted upon
would be discarded, Marks accounts, Titles, and other Game Entities should
stay as they are currently.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Judgement: TRUE

Reasons and Arguments:

Judging this CFJ has been intriguing and difficult, involving as it has
the consideration of a number of subtle arguments posted by Chuck, Garth,
Coren, Wes himself of course, and others, concerning its truth. In my
opinion, the truth of the CFJ depends upon the answers to three crucial
questions:

1. Were the Oaths both legally made?
2. Are the Oaths both binding?
3. If the answers to (1) and (2) are both YES, then does a paradox result?

It is first necessary to examine the Oaths, and here they are:

Forwarded message: (from Stella?)
> >-----
> >We hereby make an Oath, as per Rule 853, in which we swear to send a message
> >to the listserv which contains the word "Freakish" at some time during the
> >week following the Judgement of the Call for Judgement which we submit in the
> >same message as this Oath is made.
> >-----
> >We hereby make an oath, as per Rule 853, in which we swear NOT to send a
> >message to the listserv containing the word "Freakish" at any time during
> >the week following the Judgement of the Call for Judgement which we submit
> >in the same message as this Oath is made.
> >-----

1. Were the Oaths legally made?

Obviously, YES, they were. The relevant section of rule 853 states that:

      In order to make an Oath, a Player must send a message
      to at least one other Player, stating the fact that they
      are making an Oath, and what the Oath is.

      If someone makes an Oath, e must do that which e has sworn
      to do, as long as it is legal for em to do so.

Clearly, it is legal to make Oaths regardless of their content. The
second paragraph restricts only those actions which Oaths may legally
force players to make. It is legal to make an Oath to do something
illegal, although the Oath is not binding.

2. Are the Oaths both binding?

A lucid analysis was offered by Chuck:

C> There are four possible cases:

C> Case A: Both Oaths are binding.  This is the paradox Wes presents in
C> his arguments.  But he ignores the three other cases.

C> Case B: Neither Oath is binding.  In this case it would be legal
C> for Wes to post said message, or not to post it.  But then both
C> Oaths require him to perform a *legal* action, and thus both Oaths
C> are binding.  Reductio ad absurdium.

C> Case C: Oath 1 is binding, but not Oath 2.  Wes is required to post
C> said message.  Oath 2 would require him not to post said message,
C> but then he would be breaking Oath 1 and in violation of Rule 853.
C> Since Oath 2 requires him to perform an illegal action, Oath 2
C> is not binding.  This case is internally consistent.

C> Case D: Oath 2 is binding, but not Oath 1.  Wes is forbidden to post
C> said message.  Oath 1 would require him to post said message, but
C> then he would be breaking Oath 2 and in violation of Rule 853.  Since
C> Oath 1 requires him to perform an illegal action, Oath 1 is not
C> binding.  This case is also internally consistent.

Chuck went on to argue that one of the non-paradoxical cases C or D
must hold, just in virtue of their being non-paradoxical. But this
begs the question against case A. For an argument of this type to
be successful, I would need to find some justification in law for
giving precedence to one of the Oaths over the other.

Coren offers such a justification when he argues that Game Custom
dictates that the Oaths be treated as though they were made sequentially,
separated by infinitesimal amounts of time. This is how proposals are
treated for the purposes of determining the status of the proposal queue.
If we treat the Oaths this way, then case C holds.

However, it is not clear to me that Game Custom for proposals should
naturally be extended to apply to Oaths. As a matter of fact, I am
in general fairly suspicious of appeals to Game Custom alone in determining
matters of law, since Game Custom is inherently vague, arbitrary,
and, even more than the written law, liable to be interpreted in radically
different ways by different players. I prefer instead, to seek answers
in the Ruleset. Since I can find nothing in the Ruleset which gives
precedence to one of these Oaths over the other, then my answer to
question (2) is YES. The Oaths are both binding. Furthermore, since
they both derive whatever binding power they have from the same rule
(853), they are both equally binding.

3. Is there a paradox?

Given my answers to (1) and (2), it may surprise some of you to discover
that I nevertheless seriously considered a Judgement of FALSE. Why?
Because Wes' action (sending a message to the listserver in the coming
week containing the word "Freakish"), although paradoxical when it
is committed, has not been committed *yet*. Initially, I felt uncomfortable
about determining the legal status of actions as yet uncommitted. On
reflection, however, the discomfort faded. It is not difficult to
manufacture perfectly harmless cases in which Judges might be called
upon to declare an action (il)legal, although no-one has committed it yet.
Indeed, it might be very important that they do so. With this qualm
resolved, I can see no reason not to answer question (3) in the
affirmative, and Judge TRUE.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Declaration:

Rule 413 states that in the event of a TRUE Judgement of a paradox-
alleging CFJ, the Judge must "declare" which rule is responsible
for creating the paradox. I have no idea whether this declaration
has the legal status of an Injunction or not. In any case, it is
clear that the rule responsible for this situation is Rule 853,
which is inadequate in that it makes no restrictions on which Oaths
can be made. Under 413, then, and assuming this Judgement is not
overruled, the following actions are mandated:

         - Wes is declared the Winner of the Game, and becomes
           the new Speaker.
         - all active Players remain active,
         - all Proposals curently being Voted upon are removed from
           consideration for Voting,
         - the scores for all Players are set to 0 (zero),
         - the Rules and explicit game custom are reverted to the
           state they were in before Proposal 853 was passed,
         - and a new Game is begun.

I am aware that the legal force of 413 is under attack in CFJ 668.
That matter is not for me to determine.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 853 (Mutable)

      In order to make an Oath, a Player must send a message
      to at least one other Player, stating the fact that they
      are making an Oath, and what the Oath is.

      If someone makes an Oath, e must do that which e has sworn
      to do, as long as it is legal for em to do so.

      E who defies this has broken this Rule, and shall also be guilty
      of a Class C Crime.

      No rule may force someone to make an Oath;
      this rule takes precedence over all rules that attempt to do so.

Rule 413 (Mutable)

      If the Rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or
      if the legality of some action cannot be determined with
      finality, or if some action appears equally legal and illegal,
      then a player may Call For Judgement on a Statement to that
      effect.  If the Statement is judged TRUE, then the same Judge
      who judged the Statement TRUE must declare the most recent
      passed Proposal X such that the Statement was not TRUE before
      the passage of Proposal X, or declare that there is no such
      Proposal.  (Until the Judge does this, the Judgment is not
      valid.)  If the Judgement of TRUE is not overruled, then the
      Player who called for Judgement is declared the Winner of the
      game.

      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared that
      there is no such Proposal X, the game is ended, with no
      provisions for restarting it.

      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared such
      a Proposal X, the following actions are taken:
         - all Players remain active,
         - all Proposals curently being Voted upon are removed from
           consideration for Voting,
         - the scores for all Players are set to 0 (zero),
         - the Rules and explicit game custom are reverted to the
           state they were in before Proposal X was passed,
         - a Benevolent Speaker for the next Game is chosen:
              -If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the
               Benevolent Speaker, and the old Benevolent Speaker
               becomes a Voter,
              -If there is more than one Winner, the Benevolent
               Speaker randomly selects one of the Winners, who
               becomes the new Benevolent Speaker, and the old
               Benevolent Speaker becomes a Voter,
         - and a new Game is begun.

Coren receives 5 Points for Speedy Judging of CFJ 668.

Date: Sat, 30 Jul 1994 10:49:13 -0700 (PDT)
From: Gary Heavysege <coren@teleport.com>

CFJ668  Submitter: CHUCK  Judge: COREN
Barred: Wes, Jeffrey S.

Statement:
"Rule 413 is entirely void."

Relevant Rules: 413, 105, 110, 111, 116

Cran request that the Judge, if e Judges this TRUE, issue an Injunction
of the type described in Rule 789.

Argument:

Cran here present not one but *two* arguments why 413 is "entirely
void;" Cran note to the Judge that if e determines that *either*
of these are correct, e must Judge TRUE; but the Injunction requested
is only appropriate if the *first* argument is correct, because the
list of relevant Rules above are those that apply to the first argument.

Argument #1:

Rule 413 may require that the Rules revert to the state they were in
at an earlier point in time.  This would most likely cause the effective
repeal of some Rules, possibly including the transmutation and/or
repealing of currently Immutable Rules (especially 895).

Rule 116 states that Rules may be changed only as specified in
the Rules.  Rule 105 lists types of Rule Changes.  While Rule 105
is most commonly applied to proposals, *it also limits any Rule
Changes which may take place*--including those enacted by
another Rule, as opposed to one enacted by an adopted proposal.
I.e. neither a proposal nor a Rule may change the Rules by any method
except those listed in Rule 105.

Thus, if 413 would cause an Immutable Rule to be repealed, this could
not be accomplished in a single step, but the Rule would first be
transmuted to Mutable and then repealed.

So we see that in either case--if 413 causes an immutable to be transmuted
or repealed--there a transmutation of an immutable involved.

However, Rule 413 nowhere explicitly *states* that Rules shall be
transmuted; it is only implied that such would take place in the
reversion of the Rules to an earlier state.  This is in direct conflict
with Rule 110, which states, "Transmutation shall not be implied..."
By Rule 111, governing conflicts between immutable and mutable Rules,
413 is entirely void.

*****

[Judge's Comments on Argument #1:  The validity of this argument all comes
down to the interpretation of a single word in r413 - "reverted". There
are two possible ways to interpret this word...it can be considered the
*process* of putting things back the way they were, and since "process"
implies action, the above argument would be correct. Alternatively,
"revert" is sometimes used to indicate a change of state, as in setting
back a clock; this usage implies an instantaneous result. If this
interpretation is used, there are no repeals or transmutations involved,
as the future game state is set equal to the game state as it was
immediately prior to the passage of rule causing the invocation of r413,
and everything after the rule in question would have, effectively, *never
happened*.  Note that, had the original author of r413 used a different
word, such as "reset", there would be no question involved - the second
case alone would hold true.  So far as I can tell, these two
interpretations of "revert" are equally valid, so if I had to judge on
argument #1 alone, I would probably judge "UNDECIDED". However, now
Argument #2 enters the picture...]

*****

Argument #2:

If by some stretch of the imagination the above argument Rule 413 is
still "entirely void."  Rule 112 says that other Rules
may declare a winner only in two cases: 1) a win by points; or 2) a win
when play cannot continue.

Rule 413 attempts to enact a win by paradox, which clearly is not
a win on points.  However, it also describes how, if the Judge
declares a proposal X, play can continue.  Thus, Rule 413 attempts
to declare a winner on a basis other than points when play can still
continue.  This is in conflict with Immutable Rule 112.  By Rule
111, governing conflicts between Mutable and Immutable Rules, Rule 413
is entirely void.

*****

I Judge this CFJ TRUE.

Immutable r112 states that winning *MUST* be based on "...achieving n
points...", although it allows rules to change "...the magnitude of n
and the means of earning points...".  It also allows *one* special case:
"...Rules that establish Winner when play cannot continue may be
Enacted...".  As there are no ealier Immutable rules which address how
the game may be won, and Immutable r111 gives precedence to any
Immutable rule over any Mutable rule, the two cases listed above ARE THE
*ONLY* LEGAL WAYS OF WINNING THE GAME.  Any mutable rule attempting to
define another way of doing so is illegal, and, under the clause in r111
which states "In a conflict between a Mutable and an Immutable Rule, the
immutable Rule takes precedence and the Mutable Rule shall be entirely
void.", a Mutable rule whos text *in any part* conflicts with the above,
will be entirely without effect.  IMO, the clear intent of the special
case on this rule is to determine the final winner if the game ever
becomes completely static with no way of repairing the game state so as
to make further play possible.

r413 defines the winner when "...the Rules are changed so that further
play is impossible...", which, under r112 is completely legal.  However,
it goes on and attempts to define another case "...or if the legality of
some action cannot be determined with finality, or some action appears
equally legal and illegal...".  Such a case does not make further play
impossible; indeed, r413 defines how to make further play possible if
something like this happens, something COMPLETELY AT ODDS WITH THE
EXPLICIT WORDING OF r112 (and, in my opinion, with the intent).
Therefore, and in spite of the fact that r413 does contain at least one
legal case, it also contains a part that conflicts with r112, and is
thus "entirely void", making this CFJ "TRUE".

*****

Judge's notes:  I *like* the idea behind r413, although in my opinion,
it is one of the most poorly worded rules we have in the Rule Set, which
is quite an accomplishment.  Unfortunately, it isn't legal with 112
around.  In fact, there is NO way to win the game other than on a given
number of points with 112 around, something I do not like.  Yes, it is
possible to kludge this, such as with KoJen's (?) Point Thingie, which
instantaneously gives someone the points needed to win when some other
condition is fulfilled, and sets all points to zero the rest of the
time, but awkward in the extreme.  yes, it is possible to introduce
secondary victory conditions, but by a strict interpretation of r112,
*only* by making the secondary condition limit one to fewer points than
needed to win.  (This is at odds with my earlier unofficial stand on
requiring one to be Shogun to win; after going over these rules, it
appears that it *would* be necessary to use some inelegant statement
such as "One must hold the title of Shogun to have more that 90% of the
points needed to win".  Yecch.)

I will support any attempt to change r112 because of this.  In fact, the
more I look at the inconsistancies and general awkwardness enshrined in
our Immutables, the more annoying I find them.  I will support any form
of immutable reform in general, up to and including scrapping the
Immutable concept entirely and making them merely rules with a very high
"Adoption Factor" and "Mutability Index".  I approve of the recently
proposed idea of making rules with higher Factors/Indices take precedence
over those with lower ones.

Evidence: [Rules 413, 105, 110, 111, 116, 112]

Rule 413 (Mutable)
Winning by Paradox

413.  Winning By Paradox:

      If the Rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or
      if the legality of some action cannot be determined with
      finality, or if some action appears equally legal and illegal,
      then a player may Call For Judgement on a Statement to that
      effect.  If the Statement is judged TRUE, then the same Judge
      who judged the Statement TRUE must declare the most recent
      passed Proposal X such that the Statement was not TRUE before
      the passage of Proposal X, or declare that there is no such
      Proposal.  (Until the Judge does this, the Judgment is not
      valid.)  If the Judgement of TRUE is not overruled, then the
      Player who called for Judgement is declared the Winner of the
      game.

      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared that
      there is no such Proposal X, the game is ended, with no
      provisions for restarting it.

      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared such
      a Proposal X, the following actions are taken:
         - all Players remain active,
         - all Proposals curently being Voted upon are removed from
           consideration for Voting,
         - the scores for all Players are set to 0 (zero),
         - the Rules and explicit game custom are reverted to the
           state they were in before Proposal X was passed,
         - a Benevolent Speaker for the next Game is chosen:
              -If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the
               Benevolent Speaker, and the old Benevolent Speaker
               becomes a Voter,
              -If there is more than one Winner, the Benevolent
               Speaker randomly selects one of the Winners, who
               becomes the new Benevolent Speaker, and the old
               Benevolent Speaker becomes a Voter,
         - and a new Game is begun.

Rule 105 (Immutable)
What Is a Rule Change?

105.

      A Rule Change is any of the following:  (1) the enactment,
      repeal, or amendment of a mutable Rule; or (2) the transmutation
      of an immutable Rule into a mutable Rule or vice versa.
        (Note:  This definition implies that, at least initially, all
      new Rules are Mutable; Immutable Rules, as long as they are
      Immutable, may not be Amended or Repealed; Mutable Rules, as long
      as they are Mutable, may be Amended or Repealed; any Rule of any
      status may be Transmuted; no Rule is absolutely immune to change.)

Rule 110 (Immutable)
Transmutation of Rules

110.

      Rule Changes that Transmute Immutable Rules into Mutable Rules
      may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among Votes
      legally cast.  Transmutation shall not be implied, but must be
      stated explicitly in a Proposal to take effect.

Rule 111 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Conflicts

111.

      In a conflict between a Mutable and an Immutable Rule, the
      immutable Rule takes precedence and the Mutable Rule shall be
      entirely void.  For the purposes of this Rule a Proposal to
      Transmute an Immutable Rule does not "conflict" with that
      Immutable Rule.

Rule 116 (Immutable)
Permissibility of the Unprohibited

116.

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
      and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
      which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly or
      implicitly permits it.

Rule 112 (Immutable)
Winning Must Be by Points

112.

      The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered
      from achieving n points to any other state of affairs.  The
      magnitude of n and the means of earning points may be changed,
      and Rules that establish a Winner when play cannot continue may
      be Enacted and (while they are mutable) be Amended or Repealed.

I hereby accept Judgeship for CFJ's 239, 467, 515, 562, and 597. I find each

I can't find any reason why they should be judged TRUE.

KUNNE@crnvma.cern.ch spaketh:
:
: Grei and Seth did not do their civic duty and lose 43*10=430 and
: 35*10=350 Points respectively for not judging their batch in time.
: They are no longer eligible as Judge (Rule 503)
: (Maybe it's time to check if these Players are still with us??)
:
: Their batch was reassigned over the eligible Players.
: This was the number that every Player got:

: GARTH      5

: CotC

M. Clerk of the Courts, I Judge these 5 CFJ's (And NO Others! :) to be
FALSE, because there is no evidence that the CFJ's alleged to be illegal
are, in fact, illegal.

Wes' reassignment   CotC   (last one....)

----------------------------Original message----------------------------

We would like to return Judgement on all Judgements for which we have been
assigned which claim that a CFJ numbered one less than itself is illegal.

The Judgement for all such CFJ's is exactly identical to the CFJ's which
we have recently Judged by the same form, including content, reasona, and
arguments.


Enjoy!

Seth and Duane have posted their last message on July 13 and 12 resp.
As I find no trace of votes, Proposals and CFJ's and as both left

Score report  26/7-2/8
======================

This score report took a little bit more time than usual and I am
still not happy with it.
The reason is that there are still open problems:
- Michael never changed the voting results, although he admitted he
was wrong. I therefore took the liberty to change these results,
taking into account my own votes (including vototron).
- The problem with 953 was never decided.

Both of these have only minor influence on who will win the current game.
On the contrary, the problem with the disappearing Players (Grei and Seth)
does have a large influence.

It reduces the number of Players by two and this reduction helps a
Player to win.
But it seems more a case of the Limit passing the Player,
than the Player passing the Limit.

To settle the issue, I propose Steve to submit a CFJ on the question
wether he won the game.

The Mutability Index
(Creates a Rule)

All Mutable Rules shall have associated with them a number known as
the Mutability Index.  The Mutability Index (MI) must be either a
finite number greater than or equal to one or Unanimity;  unless
otherwise specified by the Rules, it shall be one in all cases.

Here's two different ways to reform the F-A Rule in the light
of Adoption Factors.  The first reflects the situation as it
is now, the second how it would look if Voter's Lib is
implemented.

Note that both Proposals preserve the system we have in the
case the Proposal *passes*.  I don't want to penalize people
for trying tough things.  But if the Proposal *fails*, I 
don't want to see people getting Points for it.

============================

Proposal xxx (Garth)
(Amends a Rule)

Rule 833 is Amended in its entirety to read:

Upon the passage of a Proposal, the Player who Proposed
it shall receive F-A Points, where F is the number of
FOR Votes cast, and A is the number of AGAINST Votes
cast.

Upon the failure of a Proposal, the Player who Proposed
it shall lose (X*A)-F Points, where F and A are as
above, and X is the Adoption Factor of the Proposal; if
X is unanimity, it shall be taken to be 10 for the 
purposes of this Rule.

===================

Proposal xxx' (Garth)

Rule 833 is Amended in its entirety to read:

Upon the passage of a Proposal, the Player who Proposed
it shall receive (2*V)-N Points, where V is the sum of
all the Votes, and N is the total number of Votes cast.

Upon the failure of a Proposal, the Player who Proposed
it shall lose (X*N)-(X+1)*V Points, where V and N are as
above, and X is the Adoption Factor of the Proposal.

The Paradox War, Take III.

CFJ 669  Submitter: WES  Judge:  GARTH

Statement:
"Judgement 668 did indeed change the interpretation of Rule 413 for the
future, but did not change in any way the effects of Rule 413 in response
to Judgement 667."

Arguments:

The last sentence of the second paragraph of Rule 789, regarding the funtion
of Injunctions regarding the interpretation of Rules states "While it remains,
it shall guide the application of that Rule." The 'it' in this sentence
refers to the Annotation created by the Injunction from a Judgement regarding
the interpretation of a Rule.

This sentence implies that the Annotation created by the Injunction only
has force while the Annotation exists. Obviously, it specifies that if the
Annotation were to cease to exist for some reason, it would cease to have
any legal force. We contend that it also specifies that before the Annotation
exists, it does not have any legal force.

Judgement 667 clearly takes effect before the Annotation of Rule 413. Judgement
667 was submitted before Judgement 668, and Judgement 667 was distributed
before Judgement 668. This would tend to indicate that Judgement 667 would
take effect before Judgement 668.

Therefore, we contend that although the Annotation created by Judgement 668
will apply to any further effects or actions taken, or attempted, by Rule
413, it has no effect on those actions or effects caused by Rule 413 in
reponse to Judgement 667.

The net result is that the Game was ended, the scores reset, and a new
Speaker declared. The Rule Set reverts back to the state in which it was in
before the passage of the Rule indicated by the Judge in Judgement 667,
as is explicit Game Custom (which has yet to be defined, incidentally).
Then, shortly afterwards, Rule 413 is Annotated by Judgement 668, making
it powerless for the future.


Enjoy!

Should any of these be reassigned to Coren, Coren finds those "FALSE", too.

Coren hopes that these CFJs go away Real Soon Now.

I am honored to be chosen as Judge on such a vital issue, and will gladly
resolve it to the best of my ability, but I have one question first:

Why is this a legal CFJ??  It does not seem to fit any of the criteria in Rule
662.  Unless someone can convince me I am mistaken in this, I'll have to send
it back to the CotC un-Judged.  (Alas and alack!)

No Move is alleged to be illegal.  The Statement does not 'clearly allege'
that a Rule is lacking in legal force.  Nor does it suggest that the current
Game State is incorrect.  

I imagine the claim is that it 'clearly alleges' that a certain Rule is to be
interpreted in a certain way.  But it does not.  It states how the *action of
a CFJ* is to be interpreted.  While Wes' intent is clear, his wording seems to
be improper.  I'd hate to throw this out on a technicality, but I may be
forced to do so.  Or rather, CotC Stella? should do so, for this is (if I am
right) not a CFJ and I am not a Judge.

Comments?

Greetings!

Here is last week's complete copy of the RuleSet (through Honour).  This 
should replace the incomplete official copy sent by the usual Rulekeepor 
earlier this week.

Rulekeepor Tempore Coren


THE CURRENT RULESET

Rules are listed as follows, where NNN represents the Rule number:

========================================

Rule NNN (Immutable or Mutable)
My Own Unofficial Title

NNN.  Semi-Official Rule Title, If There Is One

      Text of Rule

Annotation: Some Rules are annotated as required by Rule 789.
These annotations "shall guide the interpretation
of that Rule."
Relevant Rules: Such annotations include a list of relevant Rules.

[Note: Some Rules are annotated by me to clarify their interpretation.
Unlike the official annotations, these are enclosed in brackets.
These annotations have no legal force in and of themselves.]

========================================



========================================

Rule 101 (Immutable)
Obey the Rules

101.

      All Players must always abide by all the Rules then in effect,
      in the form in which they are then in effect.  The Rules in the
      Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the first game.
      The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (Immutable) and
      201-219 (Mutable).

========================================

Rule 102 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Rules

102.

      Initially Rules in the 100's are Immutable and Rules in the
      200's are Mutable.  Rules subsequently Enacted or Transmuted
      (that is, changed from Immutable to Mutable or vice versa) may
      be Immutable or Mutable regardless of their Numbers, and Rules
      in the Initial Set may be Transmuted regardless of their Numbers.

========================================

Rule 103 (Immutable)
The Speaker and Voters

103.

      At any time, each Player shall be either a Voter or the Speaker;

What Is a Rule Change?

105.

      A Rule Change is any of the following:  (1) the enactment,
      repeal, or amendment of a mutable Rule; or (2) the transmutation
      of an immutable Rule into a mutable Rule or vice versa.
        (Note:  This definition implies that, at least initially, all
      new Rules are Mutable; Immutable Rules, as long as they are
      Immutable, may not be Amended or Repealed; Mutable Rules, as long
      as they are Mutable, may be Amended or Repealed; any Rule of any
      status may be Transmuted; no Rule is absolutely immune to change.)

========================================

Rule 106 (Immutable)
Adopting Proposed Rule Changes

106.

      All Rule Changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on.
      They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required
      number of votes and Quorum is achieved.

========================================

Rule 107 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Must Be Written Down

107.

      Any proposed Rule Change must be written down (or otherwise
      communicated in print media) before it is voted on. If adopted,
      it must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.

========================================

Rule 108 (Immutable)
When May Rule Changes Take Effect?

108.

      No Rule Change may take effect earlier than the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording
      explicitly states otherwise.  No rule change may have retroactive
      application.

========================================

Rule 109 (Immutable)
Rule Numbers

109.

      The Speaker shall give each proposed Rule Change a Number for
      reference.  The numbers shall begin with 301, and each Rule
      Change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next
      successive integer, whether or not the Proposal is adopted.
        If a Rule is Repealed and Reenacted, it receives the Number of
      the Proposal to Reenact it.  If a Rule is Amended or Transmuted,
      it receives the Number of the Proposal to Amend or Transmute it.
 
========================================

Rule 110 (Immutable)
Transmutation of Rules

110.

      Rule Changes that Transmute Immutable Rules into Mutable Rules
      may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among Votes
      legally cast.  Transmutation shall not be implied, but must be
      stated explicitly in a Proposal to take effect.
 
========================================

Rule 111 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Conflicts

111.

      In a conflict between a Mutable and an Immutable Rule, the
      immutable Rule takes precedence and the Mutable Rule shall be
      entirely void.  For the purposes of this Rule a Proposal to
      Transmute an Immutable Rule does not "conflict" with that
      Immutable Rule.
 
========================================

Rule 112 (Immutable)
Winning Must Be by Points

112.

      The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered
      from achieving n points to any other state of affairs.  The
      magnitude of n and the means of earning points may be changed,
      and Rules that establish a Winner when play cannot continue may
      be Enacted and (while they are mutable) be Amended or Repealed.
 
========================================

Rule 113 (Immutable)
Players May Always Forfeit

113.

      A Player always has the option to forfeit the Game rather than
      continue to play or incur a Game penalty.  No penalty worse than
      losing, in the judgment of the Player to incur it, may be
      imposed.

========================================

Rule 114 (Immutable)
At Least One Mutable Rule

114.

      There must always be at least one Mutable Rule.  The adoption of
      Rule Changes must never become completely inpermissible.

========================================

Rule 115 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Which Change Rule-Changing Rules Allowed

115.

      Rule Changes that affect Rules needed to allow or apply
      Rule Changes are as permissible as other Rule Changes.  Even
      Rule Changes that amend or repeal their own authority are
      permissible.  No Rule Change or type of move is impermissible
      solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a
      Rule.

========================================

Rule 116 (Immutable)
Permissibility of the Unprohibited

116.

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
      and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
      which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly or
      implicitly permits it.

========================================

208.

      At the end of the prescribed Voting Period on a Proposal, the
      Speaker shall reveal all Votes legally cast on that Proposal. If
      the Speaker's consent may be required for a Proposal to be
      adopted then the Speaker should indicate at that time whether or
      not e gives eir consent.  If the Speaker does not explicitly
      indicate that e refuses to consent to the Proposal, it shall be
      assumed that e consents.

========================================

Rule 212 (Mutable)
Resolving Rule Conflicts

212.

      If two or more Mutable Rules conflict with one another, or if
      two or more Immutable Rules conflict with one another, then the
      Rule with the lowest ordinal Number takes precedence.
        If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of rule) or takes
      precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.
        If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

========================================

Rule 217 (Mutable)
Judgements Must Accord with the Rules

217.

      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however, if
      the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the Statement

Rule 404 (Mutable)
Legality of Proposals

404.  Legality of Proposals:

      As long as a Proposal satisfies all requirements in place at the
      time of its making for the proper making of Proposals, the act
      of making such a Proposal is legal regardless of its content.
      It is legal to propose a Rule which conflicts with other Rules
      or with itself, which is paradoxical, or which cannot be
      applied.

========================================

Rule 407 (Mutable)
Invoking Judgement

407.  Clerk of the Courts, Part II: Invoking Judgement:

      If Players disagree about the legality of a Move or the
      interpretation or application of a Rule, then a Player may
      invoke Judgement by submitting a Statement for Judgement to the
      Clerk of the Courts.  Disagreement, for the purposes of this
      Rule, may be created by the insistence of any Player.  When
      Judgement is invoked, the Clerk of the Courts must, as soon as
      possible, select a Judge as described in the Rules.  The Clerk
      of the Courts must then distribute the Statement to be judged,
      along with the identity of the Judge, to all Players.

      and a new Judge is selected.  A Judgement is delivered by
      submitting that Judgement to the Clerk of the Courts, who must
      then distribute that Judgement to all Players as soon as
      possible.

========================================

Rule 413 (Mutable)
Winning by Paradox

413.  Winning By Paradox:

      If the Rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or
      if the legality of some action cannot be determined with
      finality, or if some action appears equally legal and illegal,
      then a player may Call For Judgement on a Statement to that
      effect.  If the Statement is judged TRUE, then the same Judge
      who judged the Statement TRUE must declare the most recent
      passed Proposal X such that the Statement was not TRUE before
      the passage of Proposal X, or declare that there is no such
      Proposal.  (Until the Judge does this, the Judgment is not
      valid.)  If the Judgement of TRUE is not overruled, then the
      Player who called for Judgement is declared the Winner of the
      game.
      
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared that
      there is no such Proposal X, the game is ended, with no
      provisions for restarting it.
      
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared such
      a Proposal X, the following actions are taken:
         - all Players remain active,
         - all Proposals curently being Voted upon are removed from
           consideration for Voting,
         - the scores for all Players are set to 0 (zero),
         - the Rules and explicit game custom are reverted to the
           state they were in before Proposal X was passed,
         - a Benevolent Speaker for the next Game is chosen:
              -If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the
               Benevolent Speaker, and the old Benevolent Speaker
               becomes a Voter,
              -If there is more than one Winner, the Benevolent
               Speaker randomly selects one of the Winners, who
               becomes the new Benevolent Speaker, and the old
               Benevolent Speaker becomes a Voter,
         - and a new Game is begun.

========================================

Rule 415 (Mutable)
How To Submit a Proposal

415.  "How a Proposal is Submitted":

      Proposal, the Mighty Speaker shall assign the Proposal a Number
      and distribute the Proposal along with its number to all
      Players.
      
      The Mighty Speaker may also make Proposals. The Mighty Speaker
      must process all pending Voter-submitted Proposals first, and
      may then Process Proposals of the Mighty Speaker, assigning
      these Proposals a number and distributing them in the same
      fashion as any other Proposal.

      Archivist, which shall be governed by the default Rules
      concerning official posts. The initial duties of the Nomic
      Archivist shall be to record the passage and failure of
      Proposals, to maintain a "historical record" (defined below)
      of the Ruleset, to maintain a list of Judgements and their case
      histories, and to maintain a list of game Winners in past games.
      The Archivist is free to comment on the historical records as
      they see fit, but such commentary must be clearly delimited
      from the historical material. Where the material being stored
      does not already admit a classification method, the Archivist
      is free to design one themselves.

      The "historical record" of the Ruleset maintained by the
      Archivist is one that includes all rules ever part of the nomic
      Ruleset, annotated with information as to their ultimate fate,
      whether Repealed or Amended etc. This record of the Ruleset has
      no legal force.

      The duties required of the Archivist may be changed with their
      consent and at the request of the Office's controlling body
      (whatsoever that may be). Initially, the controlling body of
      this Office shall be all Players, and any request to change the
      duties must therefore be supported by a majority of Players
      "speaking" to the request.  Naturally, default Rules for
      Offices may establish a different controlling body for this
      Office.
      
      The salary of the Archivist office shall be determined by its
      controlling body. Initially, its salary shall be 5 points and
      one coin of the office-holder's group per week.

663.  General Rules For Injunctions

      There shall be an entity known as an Injunction, which may

      specifying an action or actions which must take place. If a
      Judgement is is accompanied by an Injunction, that Injunction
      must be published with the Judgement. All players must abide by
      the Injunction beginning no later than 72 hours after its
      publication unless one of the following conditions then apply:
        - The Judgement which the Injunction accompanies is undergoing
          appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of the appeal
          process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but a proposal
          has been published which would overturn that decision if
          passed, and said proposal has not failed.
        - The validity of the Injunction itself is questioned by a
          pending CFJ.
        - A Judgement upholding the validity of the Injunction is
          undergoing appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of
          the appeal process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but
          a proposal has been published which would overturn that
          decision if passed, and said proposal has not failed.

      A Judgement may not be accompanied by an Injunction unless it is
      specifically permitted elsewhere in the rules. An Injunction
      must be completely consistent with all rules in effect at the
      time of issuance, and must be completely relevant to the matter
      addressed in the corresponding judgement.

      If any Player believes that an Injunction or any part of it does
      not meet the criteria for a valid Injunction, e may submit a CFJ
      to that effect. If the resulting Judgement supports the
      contention that the criteria are not met, the Injunction shall
      be considered illegal and shall have no legal force.

      This rule takes precedence over all rules governing Injunctions.

      state. The adjustments to the game state must have been
      unambiguously specified within the CFJ, and these adjustments
      must only undo actions which were a direct or indirect result of
      that Move.

      asked if e wants the Office, and if not, a new one shall be

Rule 724 (Mutable)
Winning the Game

724.  Requirements for Winning

      The Winner is the first Voter to achieve sufficiently many
      Points.  The minimum number of Points required for Player X to
      win is 10*N*(1+G/6), where N is the number of Players currently
      registered in the Game, and G is the number of Games which
      Player X has already won.  If more than one Voter achieves this
      condition simultaneously, then all such Voters win.  When a Game
      ends in this manner:
        - If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the new
          Speaker and the old Speaker becomes a Voter.
        - If there is more than one Winner, the Voter with the highest Point 
          total becomes the new Speaker.  If more than one Voter is
          tied for the highest score, the old Speaker randomly selects
          one of them to become the new Speaker.  The old Speaker
          becomes a voter.
        - All Player's scores are reset to 0.
        - A new Game is begun.  All Rules and Proposals retain the
          status they had at the end of the old Game.

Destruction of and Compensation for Stocks of Leaving Players

      If Stock X was held at that time by another Player, this Player
      shall be compensated with half the price in Marks that this
      Player paid for the Stock X.
      These Marks shall come from the account of Player X, *before*
      those shall be destroyed, as required by other Rules.
      If there are not enough Marks available, the deficit shall be

The Marxist

736.  The Marxist

      Let there be the Patent Title known as "Marxist", which is
      awarded to the Player with the most Marks, or if tied, to the
      Players with the most Marks. Only the current richest Player
      or Players may hold this title.

      The determination and announcement of assignment and revoking
      of the Title is made by the Banker, who must use the most
      accurate means of determining this available to eim, and must
      make the announcement as soon as possible after becoming aware
      of a change in holder of the Title.

      However: To respect some Players' wish for privacy, and in
      view of the secret nature of Marks accounts, a prospective
      Marxist must first be asked if e wants the Title. If not, then
      instead of announcing, "Player x is granted the Patent Title of
      'Marxist', e announces, "Patent Title of 'Marxist' is granted
       to an anonymous Player".

      Quantity is given to an Entity, and no Rule states where that
      Conserved Quantity is to be taken from, then the transfer shall
      not take place. If a Conserved Quantity is taken from an Entity,

      forum stating what  Nomic entity is up for Auction, and that e
      is accepting bids.
 
      Players who wish to participate in the Auction then must
      indicate their interest by sending a bid to the Auctioneer.

Rule 764 (Mutable)
Mischief

764.  Mischief

      Any Player or Group X may perform an Act of Mischief directed
      at any Player or Group Y.  The permissible forms of Mischief
      are defined in other Rules; such definitions must include a 
      positive Price in Coins, or the form of Mischief is not
      permissible.  This Rule explicitly takes precedence over all
      other Rules which purport to determine which forms of Mischief
      are permissible.

      To cause an Act of Mischief,  X  sends to the Public Forum a
      message containing:
      - the Name of the object, Y;
      - the effect of the Act of Mischief;
      - the Number of the Rule which permits the form of Mischief;
      - indication of which Coins in X's account will be used as
      payment for the Act of Mischief.  Coins of Group Y, or the
      Group to which Player Y belongs, may not be used as payment.  

      The effect of the Act of Mischief is applied immediately upon 
      publication of the above message in the Forum.  An additional
      effect of this Act of Mischief is that
      - for each Coin of Group Z spent as payment above, two Points
      are removed from the Z Treasury;
      - the Coins used as payment above are removed from X's account
      and destroyed.

Rule 766 (Mutable)
Groups

766.  Amend Rule 714.

      A Group is initially formed by a set of Players which has
      registered with the Registrar to form a Group; other Players may
      join later.  Each Group has a Name, a Membership, a Vizier,
      an Ordinancekeepor, a Treasury, an Initial Set of Ordinances,
      and an associated form of Currency, called the <name> Coins,
      where <name> is the Name of the Group.

      1.  The Name may not be the Name of another Group.

      2.  The Membership is a set of Players;  these Players are
      Members of the Group, and all other Players are not.

      3.  Synchronously with the registration of a Group, two Offices
      are created known as the <name> Vizier, and the <name>
      Ordinancekeepor, where <name> is the Name of the Group.
      These Offices may never be empty, and the <name> Vizier and
      <name> Ordinancekeepor must both be a member of <name> Group.
      The <name> Vizier shall inform the Registrar whenever the
      Membership or the Ordinancekeepor of the <name> group changes.
      When the <name> Vizier changes, the new Vizier shall inform the
      Registrar of the change.
      The <name> Ordinancekeepor shall keep an accurate and current
      record of the Ordinances of the <name> Group.

      4.  The Treasury is a repository for Points and Currencies and
      has the same capabilities for holding, trading, and spending
      Points and Currencies as does a Player.

      5.  The Ordinances are a description of the operation of the
      Group.

      6.  The <name> Coins are a form of Currency which is created
      synchronously with the registration of the Group.  The <name>
      Group may create <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be
      placed in the <name> Treasury.  The <name> Group may destroy
      <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be removed from the
      <name> Treasury.

      casts its Votes; if the Ordinances are silent on this issue
      then the Group may not cast its Votes.  The Votes of the

      E must inform both the Banker and the Speaker when doing so.
      A Proposal which has Sanity imposed upon it is known as a Sane
      Proposal.  The Speaker shall, when e distributes a Sane
      Proposal, inform the Players that it is a Sane Proposal.

      No non-Voter Nomic entity may Vote on a Sane Proposal.  Each
      Voter shall have exactly one Vote on a Sane Proposal, and
      each Voter's Vote shall be counted exactly once on a Sane
      Proposal.

      This rule takes precedence over any rule allowing a non-Voter
      Nomic entity to Vote; over any rule which gives any Voter
      more or less than one Vote on a proposal; and over any

      If the Speaker has abandoned eir post, another new, Temporary
      Speaker is selected according to the "Rules of Succession", or
      if no such rules are defined, the other Player not on hold with
      the highest Score becomes the temporary Speaker.  This does not
      force the Game to be over in this case, and Scores are not reset
      to 0. The Game continues until a Player Wins, at which time a
      new Game is begun and the Winner becomes the real Speaker. The
      Temporary Speaker shall make reasonable effort to obtain the
      former Speaker's materials: proposal queue, voting records, etc.
      but if this is not possible, then the Temporary Speaker shall
      request that these be resubmitted by the Players. If a Speaker
      is replaced in this manner, e has eir score set to minus 2N
      Points immediately, where N is the number of Points required for
      a Player to Win the Game.

      Abandonment is determined as follows: If any Player suspects
      that the Speaker has Abandoned, e sends a message to all Players
      calling on the Speaker to announce eir presence.  The Speaker
      must reply to all Players within one week; if e does not, e is

      the Player may invoke Judgement on a Statement to that effect.

         same committed act, unless the last such Accusation has been
         judged UNDECIDED.
        -The following exception takes precedence over previous Rules 
         concerning Judgement: Neither Accusing nor Accused Player may
         act as Judge for the Accusation; in any case where this would
         occur, a random Voter, neither Accuser nor Accused, shall be
         Judge.
      If the Statement is judged TRUE, the Accused Player has been
      found Guilty of breaking the Rule or committing the Crime, as
      applicable.  If the Statement is judged FALSE, the Accused
      Player has been found Not Guilty of breaking the Rule or
      committing the Crime, as applicable.

      Judge the Statement as if they were Judges.  They may confer
      with each other on the case before delivering Judgement if they
      desire.  If a Justice should fail to return Judgement in the
      allotted time, e shall be fined three Points for each day by
      which e missed the deadline.  This fine shall be levied by the
      Scorekeepor.

      If a majority of the Justices' Judgements agree, the Statement

      it shall be considered to have been ruled UNDECIDED.  The
      Justices' reasoning and arguments shall be recorded with the

Rule 937 (Mutable)
Who's Responsible for Point Changes

937.  Point Changes Requested By Other Players, Part 1

      The Legal Responsibility for detecting the following classes of
      Point changes and reporting them to the Scorekeepor is bestowed
      upon another Player:

      * All Point changes directly related to the submission of
      Proposals: responsibility of Speaker, who must report these no
      later than the message announcing the voting results.

      * All Point changes directly related to voting on Proposals:
      responsibility of Speaker, who must report these no later than
      the message announcing the voting results.

      * All point changes resulting from Vototron contributions:
      responsibility of Speaker, who must report these no later than
      the message announcing the voting results.

      * All point changes resulting from fees for judgements, salaries
      and penalties given to judges: responsibility of Clerk of the
      Courts, who must report these as soon as possible, and no later
      than the message announcing the outcome of the judgement.

      * Electioneer per-position-filled salary: responsibility of
      Electioneer to notify Scorekeepor within one Week.

      * Point changes regarding the "Squealer/Ninny" Rule: If the
      Ninny must lose Points, the responsibility lies with the
      Squealer for informing the Scorekeepor as soon as possible.

      * Marks interest: responsibility of Banker to nofify Scorekeepor
      as soon as possible following the mandated interst payment.

      * Proposal lottery: responsibility of Sweepstakes Officer, who
      must notify Scorekeepor as soon as possible after the drawing.

      * Ambassador salary: responsibility of Ambassador for notifying
      Scorekeepor no later than one Week following the time the
      payment is earned.

      * Stock dividends: responsibility of the Scorekeepor who
      calculates the dividends earned. However The Banker must notify
      the Scorekeepor of changes in the Stock ownership.

      The Scorekeepor notification must be via the public forum or, if
      individually subscribable distribution lists are implemented,
      must be made on a distribution list which is potentially
      available to anyone who wishes to subscribe to it.  This
      paragraph takes precendence over other Rules which would require
      a private Scorekeepor notification. The notification need not be
      on a separate message, as long as the Scorekeepor is mentioned,
      and the message is on a list which is received by the
      Scorekeepor.

      Other classes of Point changes whose legal responsibilty for
      reporting is other than the Scorekeepor may be defined by other
      Rules.

      the Ambassador and remains an Active Player for a full Game, the
      Ambassador receives 6 Points. The Ambassador is encouraged to
      share this bounty with the new Player. Responsibility for
      notifying the Scorekeepor is given to the Ambassador, who must
      make the notification within the next Game following the first
      full Game for which the new Player is registered. The new Player
      must mention that e was invited by the Ambassador before the end
      of the first full Game; this must be made to the public forum,
      or to the Registrar.

Rule 939 (Mutable)
Score Changes from True CFJ's

939.  More Point Changes Requested By Others

      Responsibility for detecting and reporting score changes
      resulting from a CFJ being judged TRUE is given to the Clerk of

      and no later than three days following the decision of the CFJ.

Rule 941 (Mutable)
Punishments for Crimes

941.  Punishment for Crimes

      If a Player is found Guilty of a Crime because a Criminal Court
      has indicated so, e shall lose Points as follows according to
      the Class of Crime of which e is Guilty of: Class A = 2;
      Class B = 5; Class C = 8; Class D = 15. If a Player is found
      Guilty of a Crime because that Player publicly admitted such, e
      shall lose Points as follows according to the Class of Crime
      which e is Guilty of: Class A = 1; Class B = 3; Class C = 5;
      Class D = 10.

      Responsibility for notifying the Scorekeepor of these penalties
      is given to the Clerk of the Courts, who must notify the
      Scorekeepor as soon as possible following the publication of the
      judgement finding em guilty; preferably at the same time as this
      publication, and absolutely no later than one Week.
      (*Was: 608*)

========================================

Rule 942 (Mutable)
Replacement of Impossible Speaker

942.  Replacement of Impossible Speaker

      If a Speaker is determined by CFJ to have made further play
      impossible by eir actions or lack thereof, and the CFJ is not
      appealed within the allowed time, then a new Speaker is selected
      according to the "Rules of Succession", or if no such rules are
      defined, the other Player not on hold with the highest Score
      becomes the Speaker.  This does not force the Game to be over in
      this case, and Scores are not reset to 0. The Game continues
      until a Player Wins, at which time a new Game is begun and the
      Winner becomes the Speaker. The new Speaker shall make
      reasonable effort to obtain the former Speaker's materials:
      proposal queue, voting records, etc., but if this is not
      possible, then the new Speaker shall request that these be
      resubmitted by the Players. If a Speaker is replaced in this
      manner, e has eir score set to minus 2N Points immediately,
      where N is the number of Points required for a Player to Win the
      Game; this is the Scorekeepor's responsibility.

      "Impossible" is defined here to mean overwhelmingly psychotic
      behavior, a complete lack of interest in the Game, or
      uncooperativeness of the highest order. It does *not* include
      normal Speaker latitudes which have been taken by past Speakers
      for various reasons, whether justifiable or not, including but
      not limited to: temporary suspension of proposal distribution,
      resetting of scores, or the commission of Crimes or accidental
      illegal actions. The Judge of the CFJ *must* take these
      extremely tight standards into account, and the accused Speaker
      *must* be given an opportunity to defend eirself.

      This Rule adds to the set of valid classes of Judgements, and
      takes precedence over other Rules which may attempt to prevent
      this class of Judgement.

Rule 947 (Mutable)
Bonus for Repeal

947.  Reduce the complexity

      When the number of Rules is larger than 100 any proposal that
      proposes to Repeal a Rule will earn its submitter a bonus of
      5 Points on adoption.

Rule 951 (Mutable)
Selecting a Judge

951.  Fix up Barring 

      Upon receipt of a Call For Judgement (CFJ), the Clerk of the
      Courts (CotC) shall randomly appoint a Player to be Judge
      excluding those on hold, barred from Judging said CFJ, calling
      for judgement, whose move is under judgement in said CFJ, or
      have declined appointment on this CFJ.

      Players may decline to serve on a particular case by notifying
      the CotC within 72 hours of appointment.  The declining Player
      shall not be eligible to serve as Judge for this CFJ and shall
      also lose two points, one of which shall be given to the CotC. 

      Upon receiving notice of a Player declining to serve the CotC
      shall randomly appoint a new Judge from eligible Player.

      When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the Votes which
      have been legally cast shall be counted by the Speaker.  Let the
      number of Votes in favor of a Proposal divided by the number of
      Votes opposed to that Proposal be known as the Voting Factor for
      that Proposal.  If the Voting Factor exceeds the mandated
      Adoption Factor for a given Proposal, then that Proposal shall
      be Adopted.  If the Voting Factor exactly equals the required
      Adoption Factor, then the Speaker shall decide whether the
      Proposal shall be Adopted, or if the Proposal shall fail.

      The Adoption Factor for all Proposals shall be 1, unless
      otherwise specified in the Rules.  An Adoption Factor of
      unanimity is a special case:  It is defined as an absence of
      Votes in opposition, with at least one Vote in favor.

      shall declare if e opposes the Proposal when e distributes the
      Proposal.  A Contested Proposal shall have its Adoption Factor
      doubled.

Rule 957 (Mutable)
YES=FOR; NO=AGAINST; Anything else=ABSTAIN

957.  Legislative Custom

      Votes of FOR or YES are to be considered Votes in favor of a

      opposed to a Proposal.  Other Votes are not to be considered
      as in favor or opposition.

963.  Honour

      Let there be an entity called the Kudo (plural: Kudos).
      The amount of Kudos a Player holds is called eis Honour.

      Initially every Player holds 20 Kudos. New Players shall start
      with 20 Kudos as well. No Player shall have less than zero
      Kudos. No Player shall have a  non-integral number of Kudos.
      The number of Kudos held by each Player shall be kept track of
      by the Herald (an Officer) and published at least weekly.

      No more than once per Nomic week each Player may send a message
      to the Herald requesting the transfer of exactly one Kudo from
      one Player of eis choice to another Player of eis choice. The
      requesting Player may not eimself be the receiving Player.

      A Player who holds zero Kudos shall be known and addressed as
      `Honourless Worm' and shall address Players with more Honour as
      `Your Honour'.

      A Player who holds more than fourty Kudos shall be known and
      addressed as `Mighty Samourai' and may address Players with less
      Honour in any way e sees fit.

PROTO-PROPOSAL XXXX (Steve, protoed Aug 4, 1994)
(Amends a Rule)
Definition of "As Soon As Possible"

Amend Rule 907 by replacing the clause "which have a less strictly 
defined time requirement" with the clause "which e is required to
perform".

------------------ end of protoproposal ------------------------

Notes: I have noted two problems with the current 907: (i) it doesn't
enforce an ordering (or partial ordering) on required actions; (ii)
it doesn't make indefinite delays illegal. This proto addresses
only the first problem. Any comments on my solution to (i), or
ideas about solving (ii)?

Michael gets 5 Points for Speedy Judging of CFJ 318

I judge CFJ 318 FALSE.

My argument is that this is the case because how could it be
otherwise, given that the moon is in all likelihood not made of green
cheese?

Yes, you're right, my apologies. 318 was send in a different batch than
the others, but the way you phrased your Judgment obviously covers this
one two.
Therefore, Wes does not lose 10 Points, and Michael does not win
5 Points of which 3 go to Wes for timely Judging.

For all CFJ's which I have been assigned to Judge, that contain a satement of
the form "CFJ # was illegal and shall be retracted" (where the # is a
three-digit number)

I judge FALSE.

Reasons: precedent has been set several hundred times, through previous Judging
of nearly identical CFJs.  Fnord.

Here are 9 new proposals. I have not yet collated the costs of 
proposing these to the proposers under 936.

The Speaker
--------------------------------------------------------------------
PROPOSAL 985 (Chuck)
Blue an Agoraphobe
(Awards a Patent Title)

Leigh Blue Caldwell shall be awarded the Patent Title of Agoraphobe.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
PROPOSAL 986 (Chuck)

Doug Hofstadter a Hero
(Awards a Patent Title)

Douglas R. Hofstadter is awarded the Patent Title of Hero.

PROPOSAL 987 (Chuck)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Repeal Private Mail Requirement
(Repeals a Rule)

Rule 815 is repealed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal 988 (Fnord.)
Define Goals
(creates a rule)

Let there be an Entity known as the Goal.  One Goal shall exist
for each player.  The Goal shall consist of one sentence, which
begins "Player X's Goal is a Game where " and ends with an
explanation of a possible state of the Game, where X is the name
of a Player or the letter X.  This Player named, if any, shall be
known as the goal's owner.  No two Goals may have the same owner.

Let there be an Entity know as the Success Cache.  All rewards
and penalties for Players based on Goals must be paid to or from
the Success Cache.  Upon passage of this Rule, or if the Success
Cache becomes empty, one Kudo shall be transferred from each
active Player and placed in the Success Cache.

Let there be an Officer known as the Goalkeepor.  The Goalkeepor
shall keep track of the Goals of all Players.  

[This Proto-Proposal shall create Goals for each player, thus
lending some direction to Players.  Currently, some have personal
Goals, while others are vague on the subject.  It also defines
the Success Cache, important for the operation of the
Goalkeepor.]

- -----------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 989 (Fnord.)
Generate Goals
(creates a rule)

Upon passage of this Proposal and choice of a Goalkeepor, each
Player shall submit to the Goalkeepor three sample Goals, with
the letter "X" in place of a name of a Player, within four weeks
after the passage of this Proposal.  Players who fail to do so
will lose five Kudos, which shall be placed in the Success Cache.

The Goalkeepor shall then create a List of all sample Goals and
submit it to the Public Forum.  The Goalkeepor may reject any
sample Goals which are significantly harder or easier to achieve
than the average sample Goal.  If any sample Goals are very
similar to another sample Goal, the Goalkeepor shall only place
one of the group of similar Goals on the List.

Each Player shall then select one sample Goal and inform the
Goalkeepor.  If two Players choose the same sample Goal, either
may have the option of changing eir choice.  If one Player
behaved more in a manner similar to eir chosen sample Goal that
the other, then the former player shall receive the sample Goal
and the latter shall choose another.  If still there is a
dispute, a bidding war shall be conducted in a manner identical
to the method for bidding on Stocks, with the proceeds going to
the Bank.

This list shall be transformed into a proper Proposal with the
NRC declaration (assigns Goals) and an Adoption Factor of 1.  If
it passes, all sample Goals shall be modified so that each Player
owns the goal e chose.  If it fails, the Goalkeepor shall modify
the list in a way intended to allow it to pass, and keep doing so
until it does pass.

When a Player enters the Game, e shall choose a Goal from the
remaining Goals on the List that were not assigned.  This Goal
shall be converted to a Proposal in the same way as above, and if
it passes the Goal shall be modified so that Player owns the
Goal.  If it fails, the player must go through this process
again.  When a Game ends, all Goals shall be destroyed. and this
process for creating them shall begin again.  If at any time the
Goalkeepor has insufficient sample Goals to assign a Player, e
may call for all Players to submit one new sample Goal each, with
a penalty of one Kudo to be transferred to the Success Cache for
failure to submit a Goal.
  
[For those who already have personal
goals in Nomic, they are given priority to retain these informal
goals.]
  
- -----------------------------------------------------------------
  
Proposal 990 (Fnord.)
Reward and Penalize Voting/Proposals According to Goals
(creates a rule)
  
The Goalkeepor shall determine if any Votes made by a Player move
the game state closer to or farther from the state described in
eis Goal.  For every five Votes which further the Player's Goal,
e shall receive one Kudo.  For every five Votes which hamper the
player's Goal, e shall lose one Kudo.
  
The Goalkeepor shall determine if any Proposals made by a Player
that pass move the game state closer to or farther from the state
described in eis Goal.  For every successful Proposal which
furthers the Player's Goal, e shall receive one Kudo.  For every
successful Proposal which hampers the player's Goal, e shall lose
one Kudo.
  
The Goalkeepor shall publish a Success Report of all Kudos
transferred as a result of any Rules involving Goals every time a
Voting period ends, or if a Player is partway toward receiving or
losing a Kudo, how far e is from receiving of losing a Kudo.  The
Herald must make all Kudo transfers specified in the Success
Report.
  
Additional legislation may define other Actions which result in
gain or loss of Kudos, as long as play which furthers a player's
Goal is rewarded and/or play which hampers a player's Goal is
punished.
  
- -----------------------------------------------------------------
  
Proposal 991 (Fnord.)
Ultimate Reward for Achievement of Goal
(creates a rule)
  
If a Player believes that the current state of the Game coincides
with the state described in any Player's Goal, e shall submit a
CFJ.  If this CFJ is judged True, then the Player whose Goal
matches the state of the Game shall receive exactly the number of
Points needed to Win.  Two Players may accomplish their Goals
simultaneously, in which case both win the Game.
  
[In real life, it could be said that one "wins" if one
accomplishes ones goals in life.  The same should hold true for
Agora Nomic.]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
PROPOSAL 992 (Stella?)
Curb CFJ's
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 407 by adding at the end:
No Player shall submit more than five CFJ's per week.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
PROPOSAL 993 (Stella?)
When the Cat is away....
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 736 by adding at its end:
No Player shall ever hold the Marxist title (even if attributed
anonymously) for a accumulated period longer than four weeks. E shall
take all necessary steps to prevent this from happening.

If a Player violates this rule, the Banker will take all but five
Marks away from this Player and distribute said Marks in equal parts
over all active Players.

NOTICE FROM THE HERALD:
Until I get a program written this will be done by hand.  I 
plan on posting reasons given for requested transfers unless
notified within said transfer not to post.

The list of Players is taken from the most recent address list
I have, with an update for Alice.

KUDO ACTIONS REQUESTED:
***
>From ccarroll@students.wisc.edu Mon Aug  1 00:25:49 1994

Herald, Cran hereby request the transfer of one Kudo from Michael
Norrish to Jeffrey S.

Jeffrey S. has recently been Honourable in not one, but two regards.
First, (as Cran noted above) he was the *only* Player to apply for
the Office of Herald.  Secondly, after there was considerable outrage
against a judgement of his, he returned his Judge's salary to the
Point Reserve.

Cran feel that Michael's distribution of proposals 965-969
in condensed form is disHonourable.  While it may be legal,
Cran would like to see the entire proposal as submitted.
***
>From coren@teleport.com Mon Aug  1 00:46:10 1994

CFJ 670  Submitter: STELLA?  Judge:  TIMOTHY

"The word `salary' in rules 417, 516, 849 and 902 must be interpreted
as `payment made at regular intervals for services rendered':
TANSTAAFL!"

Arguments:

"There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch!"

The Rules quoted define the salaries for various Officers as
a fixed amount of Points per Nomic week. Up to now such payments
where made even if the concerned Officer was negligent in eir
duties. However, the dictionary definition of the word salary is
`payment made at regular intervals for services rendered':
hence an Officer who does not perform the duties of eir Office
shall not receive any salary.
Note that the CotC only receives eis salary as reward `for carrying
out his duties' (Rule 889) and the Ambassador receives eis Points
`in any Nomic Week in which Foreign Policy activity occurs' (Rule 809)
which seems the more logical application.

At present there are several Officers who do not fulfill their duty.

References:
417.  Establishment of the Office of Archivist:

      That there be established an office known as the Nomic
      Archivist, which shall be governed by the default Rules
      concerning official posts. The initial duties of the Nomic
      Archivist shall be to record the passage and failure of
      Proposals, to maintain a "historical record" (defined below)
      of the Ruleset, to maintain a list of Judgements and their case
      histories, and to maintain a list of game Winners in past games.
      The Archivist is free to comment on the historical records as
      they see fit, but such commentary must be clearly delimited
      from the historical material. Where the material being stored
      does not already admit a classification method, the Archivist
      is free to design one themselves.

      The "historical record" of the Ruleset maintained by the
      Archivist is one that includes all rules ever part of the nomic
      Ruleset, annotated with information as to their ultimate fate,
      whether Repealed or Amended etc. This record of the Ruleset has
      no legal force.

      The duties required of the Archivist may be changed with their
      consent and at the request of the Office's controlling body
      (whatsoever that may be). Initially, the controlling body of
      this Office shall be all Players, and any request to change the
      duties must therefore be supported by a majority of Players
      "speaking" to the request.  Naturally, default Rules for
      Offices may establish a different controlling body for this
      Office.

      The salary of the Archivist office shall be determined by its
      controlling body. Initially, its salary shall be 5 points and
      one coin of the office-holder's group per week.

      The initial office-holder for this post shall be Michael
      Norrish.

516.  Marks

      There shall be a new unit of currency known as Marks. Any Player
      may possess zero or more Marks, but not less than zero. Any
      Player may give any number of Marks to any other Player, as long
      as that Player will not possess less than zero Marks at the end
      of the trade. There shall also be an entity known as the Bank,
      which shall possess Marks exactly like a Player. There shall
      also be an Office known as the Banker. The Banker shall keep an
      accurate record of how many Marks each Player possesses, and how
      many Marks are possessed by the Bank.  The Banker shall recieve
      a salary of 3 Points after every seven days in Office.

809.  The Ambassador:  Conduct of Foreign Policy

      There shall be an Office known as the Ambassador.  The
      Ambassador shall have the sole power to conduct Foreign
      Policy.  Foreign Policy is defined as interacting with
      other Nomic Games in an official capacity, and/or
      participating on behalf of the Players of this Nomic
      Game in any Central Nomic Game to be created.

      The Ambassador shall report to the Public Forum once a
      Nomic Week on any new Foreign Policy developements of
      that Nomic Week or the previous one.  In any Nomic Week
      in which Foreign Policy activity occurs, the Ambassador
      shall receive a salary of two (2) Points.

      Upon any change in the position of Speaker, the Office
      of Ambassador shall devolve to the new Speaker.  Except
      for this provision, the Office is chosen as described
      in other Rules.

      Proposals may be submitted directing the Ambassador on
      how to conduct a single piece of Foreign Policy business.
      Such Proposals are automatically Sane, and if passed are
      binding upon the Ambassador.  If the Ambassador acts
      contrary to such a Proposal, e may be charged with a
      Class C Crime.  Such Proposals are submitted with the
      the following legal Declaration:
         (Foreign Policy Directive)

849.  Salaries of Officers

     Officers (excluding Viziers, Ordinancekeepors, and any other
     Officers whose duties pertain only to a single Group) shall
     receive a salary of 3 Points per week.

     This Rule applies to Offices in general, and defers to the Rules
     for specific Offices.

889.  Clerk of the Courts, Part I, Take 2

      There shall exist an Office "Clerk of the Courts", who shall
      have general responsibility over administering Calls for
      Judgement, as outlined in the Rules.

      As a salary for carrying out his duties, he will receive 5
      points at the end of every seven days he is in Office, counting
      from his assumption of the Office.

      The initial holder of this Office shall be the Player who
      submitted this Proposal.
      (*Was: 406*)

902.  Scorekeepor Salary

      The Salary of the Scorekeepor is 5 Points per Week.

Indeed, I can find little in the Ruleset to support such a view. The
only vaguely relevant rule is, as you suggest, 102:
 
Rule 102 (Immutable)
      Initially Rules in the 100's are Immutable and Rules in the
      200's are Mutable.  Rules subsequently Enacted or Transmuted
      (that is, changed from Immutable to Mutable or vice versa) may
      be Immutable or Mutable regardless of their Numbers, and Rules
      in the Initial Set may be Transmuted regardless of their Numbers.

But I can't see that anything here conflicts with a plan to create
new classes of Rules. Furthermore, from discussions with Peter Suber
I greatly doubt that any such partition was intended.

Steve

You are correct.  I have worded my statements poorly.  I will try again.
  1.   I think that there are two classes:  ratio and absolute
  2.   I like the idea of adding new ratios to the first class.
  3.   I do not see how any ratio rule can change an absolute rule.

Sorry for the confusion.

This will only work if we unanimously agree to change an absolute rule
into a ratio rule.  I could support changing absolutes into a (higher)
ratio rule in some circumstances.

I must be missing part of what you mean.  Could you try to explain to
me again?  I do not want to disagree on principle alone when I am not
sure of your argument.

[FLASH]
ohhhh, re-reading it an n time, I may understand now.  Your statement
is that by changing /solely/ the classification (absolute to ratio) 
of a rule, we are not changing the actual rule.  My example of this
would be:
  
,   Proposal XXXX  Switcheroo for 102
,   (transmogrifies)
,
,   Transmogrify Rule 102 into Mutability Classification of 80%.
,
,   [Speaker's note: This proposal has sanity imposed upon it.]
,   
,   Vote totals:  8-5-1  Passes
,
,  now leaving us with rule 102 that could be passed by an 80% vote
,  rather than 51%

hmm, I dont think this would fly.  Then again, maybe I still don't 
understand.  Maybe because I think adding new ratios is just a variation 
of the current ratio class and not a truly separate class.

Actually, we did not receive the Judgement until your "reminder". Since you
are required to distribute said Judgement to "all Players" according to Rule
407, rather than the Public Forum, the distribution of that CFJ had not
been completed until we received it. Therefore, our time limit for returning 
Judgement did not begin until that time. 

Do you agree, or should we submit a CFJ???

Oh, and at any rate, we would like to be Eligible for future Judgements,
regardless. 

Enjoy!

But they do require wording that 'clearly alleges' what's wrong.  On balance,
though, I'll Judge it and see if it's Appealed.

Following remarks by Stella?, and further thought of my own, here is
the revised Proto for 907:

PROTO-PROPOSAL XXXX (Steve, first proto Aug 4, revised Aug 7)
(Amends a Rule)
Definition of "As Soon As Possible"

Amend Rule 907 to read:

      Whenever a Player is required to perform a certain action "as
      soon as possible", e is required to perform that action within
      a week, and no later than any other action e is required to perform.
      However, activity of a purely discussionary nature is excluded 
      from the ordering requirement, and may be conducted at any time.

      This Rule defines the latest time at which actions to be performed
      "as soon as possible" may legally be performed, and it takes
      precedence over other Rules which define a later latest 
      time for the performance of these actions. Other Rules may, however,
      impose earlier latest times, and if so, this Rule defers to them.

      This Rule defers to Rules which describe the responsibilities of
      Players who are On Hold.
      (*Was: 805*)
----------------------------------------
Notes:
1. I have opted for a partial ordering rather than a full ordering. The
difference is that a partial ordering allows Officers to perform actions
simultaneously. For example, say for whatever reason I am unable to log
in again until Thursday Aug 11. My responsibilities as Speaker will then
include publishing the results for all the proposals (965-979) for which
voting closes on Aug 8, and also the proposals (980-984) for which voting
closes on Aug 10. A full ordering would require two messages; a partial
ordering allows me to collect the results into one message.

2. I have removed the vague talk of "less strictly defined time requirements",
since I have no idea what these are. I hope my new precedence claim is clear.

3. I have made explicit the precedence of the On Hold Rules over this one.
Of course, for the moment the On Hold Rule takes precedence anyway in
virtue of its lower number. Thanks to our current rule-renumbering practices,
however, we cannot rely on this situation lasting very long. Sigh. When
*will* we ever manage immutable reform?

Steve
