It has come to my attention that CFJ may not have gotten
distributed after I processed it.  If this is so, please
inform me.  I apologize for the confusion.  [With the 
loss of my records last week I cannot determine what was
done or not done.  Would someoe please check their records
to see if CFJs thru 118 have been distributed.  ThanQ]

*CFJ 115 (Chuck)

*Submitted: Wed Feb 16 03:26:05 1994

*The Judge shall be:  Oerjan

*Statement to be Judged:
Rule 101 has no legal force.
Relevant Rules: 101, 111, 212.

*Reasoning for CFJ:
Argument:
I will show that the assumption that 101 does have legal force
leads to a paradox.  Thus, 101 does not have legal force.

Rule 101 says that players must obey *all* Rules, always.  It does not
say, "obey the Rules, unless they conflict and one takes precedence
over another, in which case the latter need not be obeyed."

Rule 111 and Rule 212 both specify cases where Rules conflict and
one or the other is not obeyed.  However, by Rule 101 both conflicting
Rules must be obeyed.  And it does no good to say that Rule 111 and/or
Rule 212 have no effect, for by Rule 101 they must be obeyed as well!

For example: suppose Rules 994 and 996 conflict, and 996 claims
precedence over 994.  By Rule 212, 996 has precedence, and (implicitly)
994 does not have to be followed.  But, by Rule 101, *both* Rules must
be followed.  (And you cannot say that 212 is null and void because
it conflicts with 101, because by 101 Rule 212 must also be obeyed.)

Paradox!  If Rule 101 has legal force you must obey both conflicting
Rules; and you must obey as well a Rule which says to ignore one of
the conflicting Rules.  Thus, the only conclusion is that Rule 101
does *not* have legal force.

(You can come up with even more tangled and twisted paradoxes looking only
at 101, 111, and 212 without even going to other conflicting Rules.
The only way out of the paradox is if 101 does not have legal force.)

(Note that by Rule 789, the Judge may issue an Injunction if e
finds this CFJ TRUE.)

(I believe this (if judged TRUE) does not present as great a problem
for the game as might appear at first glance.  Consider that by
game custom, we follow all rules *except* when Rules conflict with
each other.)

Relevant Rules:
===================
Rule 101 (Immutable)
Obey the Rules

101.  All Players must always abide by all the Rules then in effect,
      in the form in which they are then in effect.  The Rules in the
      Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the first game.
      The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (Immutable) and
      201-219 (Mutable).

=============
Rule 111 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Conflicts

111.  In a conflict between a Mutable and an Immutable Rule, the
      immutable Rule takes precedence and the Mutable Rule shall be
      entirely void.  For the purposes of this Rule a Proposal to
      Transmute an Immutable Rule does not "conflict" with that
      Immutable Rule.
 
==================
Rule 212 (Mutable)
Resolving Rule Conflicts

212.  If two or more Mutable Rules conflict with one another, or if
      two or more Immutable Rules conflict with one another, then the
      Rule with the lowest ordinal Number takes precedence.
        If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of rule) or takes
      precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.
        If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

Greetings.  I hope that all of you had a good weekend.

I am a little busy at the moment in my little life.  I will
respond to email messages as Clerk and Speaker, but 
processing everything may take me a day or two or three.

I just wanted all to know what the priorities for me were.
   1  Processing Judgements for issued CFJs
   2  Results of Proposals
   3  New Proposals
   4  new CFJs

Other items, of course, may intrude, and I can be persuaded,
I suppose, to alter this order under somme circumstances.

The Proposal Queue is currently full, so please do not send
me anymore.  :)

That's it for now, I'll be reading, even if I do not have time
to process.

It has come to my knowledge that David Nicol as well applied for the
Office of Ambassador. Therefore a random determination must be done.

I have here before me on the desk a Norwegian 5 Krone coin.
One of its sides has a picture of our beloved late King Olav the 5th.
The other has a picture of a heraldic shield. Let us call the first side
the Head and the second side the Tail.
In a moment I will be flipping the coin into the air, thereafter catching it
with one hand and then placing it on the back of my other hand. If the
Head ends on top, Garth will be the Ambassador, as earlier announced.
If the Tail ends on top, David Nicol will be the Ambassador.

Suspense..

HEAD!

Garth Rose, you are (still) the Ambassador.

Greetings,
Oerjan.

Play Fantasy Rule Nomic and win Free Points and Marks
=====================================================

My next message will be the announcement of the start of the 17th
Fantasy Rule Round, a nomic-like game.

After the Round I will distribute my Points and Marks -if any- among
the Nomic Players, who participated and succeeded in posting at least
one VALID Rule.
(I will transfer 1 Point for every VALID Fantasy Rule submitted
by a Nomic Player plus a bonus for every Style Point won with the Rule.)

Of the Nomic players only Garth, Oerjan and David Nicol are active FR
Players. (And you don't want them to collect *all* these Points, do you?)

The Regular Ordinances (sort of FR Immutables) will be posted in
the next message.

To participate send me a message. Most FR mail passes via a server.
To post a rule, send a message to frc@nvg.unit.no

THE CURRENT RULESET
Part 1 of 3

Rules are listed as follows, where NNN represents the Rule number:

========================================

Rule NNN (Immutable or Mutable)
My Own Unofficial Title

NNN.  Semi-Official Rule Title, If There Is One

      Text of Rule

[Note:  I have annotated some Rules to clarify their interpretation.
However, these annotations have no legal force in and of themselves.]

========================================



========================================

Rule 101 (Immutable)
Obey the Rules

101.

      All Players must always abide by all the Rules then in effect,
      in the form in which they are then in effect.  The Rules in the
      Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the first game.
      The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (Immutable) and
      201-219 (Mutable).

========================================

Rule 102 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Rules

102.

      Initially Rules in the 100's are Immutable and Rules in the
      200's are Mutable.  Rules subsequently Enacted or Transmuted
      (that is, changed from Immutable to Mutable or vice versa) may
      be Immutable or Mutable regardless of their Numbers, and Rules
      in the Initial Set may be Transmuted regardless of their Numbers.

========================================

Rule 103 (Immutable)
The Speaker and Voters

103.

      At any time, each Player shall be either a Voter or the Speaker;
      no Player may simultaneously be a Voter and a Speaker. At any
      time, there shall be exactly one Speaker. The term "Player" in
      the Rules shall specifically include both the Voters and the
      Speaker.

========================================

Rule 104 (Immutable)
First Speaker

104.

      The Speaker for the first game shall be Michael Norrish.

========================================

Rule 105 (Immutable)
What Is a Rule Change?

105.

      A Rule Change is any of the following:  (1) the enactment,
      repeal, or amendment of a mutable Rule; or (2) the transmutation
      of an immutable Rule into a mutable Rule or vice versa.
        (Note:  This definition implies that, at least initially, all
      new Rules are Mutable; Immutable Rules, as long as they are
      Immutable, may not be Amended or Repealed; Mutable Rules, as long
      as they are Mutable, may be Amended or Repealed; any Rule of any
      status may be Transmuted; no Rule is absolutely immune to change.)

========================================

Rule 106 (Immutable)
Adopting Proposed Rule Changes

106.

      All Rule Changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on.
      They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required
      number of votes and Quorum is achieved.

========================================

Rule 107 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Must Be Written Down

107.

      Any proposed Rule Change must be written down (or otherwise
      communicated in print media) before it is voted on. If adopted,
      it must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.

========================================

Rule 108 (Immutable)
When May Rule Changes Take Effect?

108.

      No Rule Change may take effect earlier than the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording
      explicitly states otherwise.  No rule change may have retroactive
      application.

========================================

Rule 109 (Immutable)
Rule Numbers

109.

      The Speaker shall give each proposed Rule Change a Number for
      reference.  The numbers shall begin with 301, and each Rule
      Change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next
      successive integer, whether or not the Proposal is adopted.
        If a Rule is Repealed and Reenacted, it receives the Number of
      the Proposal to Reenact it.  If a Rule is Amended or Transmuted,
      it receives the Number of the Proposal to Amend or Transmute it.
 
========================================

Rule 110 (Immutable)
Transmutation of Rules

110.

      Rule Changes that Transmute Immutable Rules into Mutable Rules
      may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among Votes
      legally cast.  Transmutation shall not be implied, but must be
      stated explicitly in a Proposal to take effect.
 
========================================

Rule 111 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Conflicts

111.

      In a conflict between a Mutable and an Immutable Rule, the
      immutable Rule takes precedence and the Mutable Rule shall be
      entirely void.  For the purposes of this Rule a Proposal to
      Transmute an Immutable Rule does not "conflict" with that
      Immutable Rule.

========================================

Rule 112 (Immutable)
Winning Must Be by Points

112.

      The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered
      from achieving n points to any other state of affairs.  The
      magnitude of n and the means of earning points may be changed,
      and Rules that establish a Winner when play cannot continue may
      be Enacted and (while they are mutable) be Amended or Repealed.
 
========================================

Rule 113 (Immutable)
Players May Always Forfeit

113.

      A Player always has the option to forfeit the Game rather than
      continue to play or incur a Game penalty.  No penalty worse than
      losing, in the judgment of the Player to incur it, may be
      imposed.

========================================

Rule 114 (Immutable)
At Least One Mutable Rule

114.

      There must always be at least one Mutable Rule.  The adoption of
      Rule Changes must never become completely inpermissible.

========================================

Rule 115 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Which Change Rule-Changing Rules Allowed

115.

      Rule Changes that affect Rules needed to allow or apply
      Rule Changes are as permissible as other Rule Changes.  Even
      Rule Changes that amend or repeal their own authority are
      permissible.  No Rule Change or type of move is impermissible
      solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a
      Rule.

========================================

Rule 116 (Immutable)
Permissibility of the Unprohibited

116.

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
      and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
      which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly or
      implicitly permits it.

========================================

Rule 201 (Mutable)
Quorum

201.

      Quorum for a proposed Rule Change is defined to be 20% of Voters
      at the beginning of the prescribed Voting Period for that
      Proposal.

========================================

Rule 206 (Mutable)
One Voter, One Vote

206.

      Each Voter has exactly one Vote.  The Speaker may not Vote.

========================================

Rule 208 (Mutable)
End of the Voting Period

208.

      At the end of the prescribed Voting Period on a Proposal, the
      Speaker shall reveal all Votes legally cast on that Proposal. If
      the Speaker's consent may be required for a Proposal to be
      adopted then the Speaker should indicate at that time whether or
      not e gives eir consent.  If the Speaker does not explicitly
      indicate that e refuses to consent to the Proposal, it shall be
      assumed that e consents.

========================================

Rule 212 (Mutable)
Resolving Rule Conflicts

212.

      If two or more Mutable Rules conflict with one another, or if
      two or more Immutable Rules conflict with one another, then the
      Rule with the lowest ordinal Number takes precedence.
        If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of rule) or takes
      precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.
        If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

355.  Determining when a Rule has been broken:

      If a Player believes that any Player has not abided by a Rule
      then in effect, in the form in which it was then in effect, then
      the Player may invoke Judgement on a Statement to that effect.
      However,
        -The Accusing player immediately loses 5 points.
        -No Player may be so Accused of actions committed before the
         adoption of this Rule or more than 30 days before the
         Accusation.
        -No Player may be so Accused more than once concerning the
         same committed act, unless the last such Accusation has been
         judged UNDECIDED.
        -The following exception takes precedence over previous Rules 
         concerning Judgement: Neither Accusing nor Accused Player may
         act as Judge for the Accusation; in any case where this would
         occur, a random Voter, neither Accuser nor Accused, shall be
         Judge.
      If the Statement is judged TRUE, the Accused Player has been
      convicted of breaking the Rule.  If the Statement is judged
      FALSE, the Accused Player has been acquitted of breaking the
      Rule.

404.  Legality of Proposals:

      As long as a Proposal satisfies all requirements in place at the

      of making such a Proposal is legal regardless of its content.
      It is legal to propose a Rule which conflicts with other Rules

      applied.

========================================

Rule 405 (Mutable)

      Court may never be selected as a Judge.

      As a salary for carrying out his duties, he will receive 5
      points at the end of every seven days he is in Office, counting
      from his assumption of the Office.

407.  Clerk of the Courts, Part II: Invoking Judgement:

      If Players disagree about the legality of a Move or the
      interpretation or application of a Rule, then a Player may
      invoke Judgement by submitting a Statement for Judgement to the
      Clerk of the Courts.  Disagreement, for the purposes of this
      Rule, may be created by the insistence of any Player.  When
      Judgement is invoked, the Clerk of the Courts must, as soon as
      possible, select a Judge as described in the Rules.  The Clerk
      of the Courts must then distribute the Statement to be judged,
      along with the identity of the Judge, to all Players.

      then distribute that Judgement to all Players as soon as
      possible.

========================================

Rule 413 (Mutable)
Winning by Paradox

413.  Winning By Paradox:

      If the Rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or
      if the legality of some action cannot be determined with
      finality, or if some action appears equally legal and illegal,
      then a player may Call For Judgement on a Statement to that
      effect.  If the Statement is judged TRUE, then the same Judge
      who judged the Statement TRUE must declare the most recent
      passed Proposal X such that the Statement was not TRUE before
      the passage of Proposal X, or declare that there is no such
      Proposal.  (Until the Judge does this, the Judgment is not
      valid.)  If the Judgement of TRUE is not overruled, then the
      Player who called for Judgement is declared the Winner of the
      game.
      
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared that
      there is no such Proposal X, the game is ended, with no
      provisions for restarting it.
      
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared such
      a Proposal X, the following actions are taken:
         - all Players remain active,
         - all Proposals curently being Voted upon are removed from
           consideration for Voting,
         - the scores for all Players are set to 0 (zero),
         - the Rules and explicit game custom are reverted to the
           state they were in before Proposal X was passed,
         - a Benevolent Speaker for the next Game is chosen:
              -If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the
               Benevolent Speaker, and the old Benevolent Speaker
               becomes a Voter,
              -If there is more than one Winner, the Benevolent
               Speaker randomly selects one of the Winners, who
               becomes the new Benevolent Speaker, and the old
               Benevolent Speaker becomes a Voter,
         - and a new Game is begun.

========================================

Rule 415 (Mutable)
How To Submit a Proposal

415.  "How a Proposal is Submitted":

      A Proposal by a Voter shall be made by submitting it to the
      Mighty Speaker. As soon as possible after receiving the
      Proposal, the Mighty Speaker shall assign the Proposal a Number
      and distribute the Proposal along with its number to all
      Players.
      
      The Mighty Speaker may also make Proposals. The Mighty Speaker
      must process all pending Voter-submitted Proposals first, and
      may then Process Proposals of the Mighty Speaker, assigning
      these Proposals a number and distributing them in the same
      fashion as any other Proposal.

========================================

Rule 417 (Mutable)
The Nomic Archivist

417.  Establishment of the Office of Archivist:

      That there be established an office known as the Nomic
      Archivist, which shall be governed by the default Rules
      concerning official posts. The initial duties of the Nomic
      Archivist shall be to record the passage and failure of
      Proposals, to maintain a "historical record" (defined below)
      of the Ruleset, to maintain a list of Judgements and their case
      histories, and to maintain a list of game Winners in past games.
      The Archivist is free to comment on the historical records as
      they see fit, but such commentary must be clearly delimited
      from the historical material. Where the material being stored
      does not already admit a classification method, the Archivist
      is free to design one themselves.

      The "historical record" of the Ruleset maintained by the
      Archivist is one that includes all rules ever part of the nomic
      Ruleset, annotated with information as to their ultimate fate,
      whether Repealed or Amended etc. This record of the Ruleset has
      no legal force.

      The duties required of the Archivist may be changed with their
      consent and at the request of the Office's controlling body
      (whatsoever that may be). Initially, the controlling body of
      this Office shall be all Players, and any request to change the
      duties must therefore be supported by a majority of Players
      "speaking" to the request.  Naturally, default Rules for
      Offices may establish a different controlling body for this
      Office.
      
      The salary of the Archivist office shall be determined by its
      controlling body. Initially, its salary shall be 5 points and
      one coin of the office-holder's group per week.
      
      The initial office-holder for this post shall be Michael
      Norrish.

========================================

Rule 434 (Mutable)
Game May Be Won By CFJ

434.  Judgement Required to Win (and Timing of Win):

      If a Player believes that he has won the Game, he may submit a
      CFJ to that effect.  If it is returned with the Judgement TRUE
      (and that Judgement is not Appealed), then he has won the Game
      as of the delivery of that Judgement.  If the Judgement is TRUE,
      but is Appealed, but is sustained (and no Proposal to reverse
      the verdict is made), then he has won the Game as of the
      delivery of the Appeal verdict.  If such a verdict is sustained,
      challenged by Proposal, but the Proposal does not pass, he has
      won the Game as of the completion of the Vote on that Proposal.

      Judgement on a CFJ to win the Game may *not* be delivered until
      at least 72 hours after its official announcement, in order to
      give time for the Judge to accept input from the community.

      This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which specifies
      the exact moment at which a Game is won.

[Note: Implicit Game Custom dictates that, despite the title,
this rule does not *require* a CFJ in order to win the game.]

========================================

Rule 450 (Mutable)
Game Entities May Not Be Arbitrarily Changed

450.  Game Entities may not be Arbitrarily Changed:

      Any Entity which is created by the Nomic Rules, and which exists only

      Votes, etc. may *not* be changed by any action other than those
      specified by the Rules.

========================================

Rule 451 (Mutable)
Determination of Judgement--Timing

451.  Timing of CFJ Results:

      When a CFJ makes a Statement about the current state of the
      Game, the result of that CFJ shall be TRUE if and only if the
      Judge feels that that Statement was correct at the time that the
      CFJ was *issued*. Any changes that have happened in the time
      between the issuing of the CFJ and its delivery must be figured
      in to find the correct current state.

452.  Prohibition of Electioneering by the Mighty Speaker:

      The Speaker may not use eis knowledge of the current status of a

      considered a Class C Crime.

========================================

Rule 454 (Mutable)
Declaring Proposals

454.  Clarity of Proposals:

      All Proposals must declare what effect that Proposal will have
      on the Rule Set. If said Proposal has a Title, this Declaration
      shall appear on the line immediately below that Title. In any
      case, the Declaration shall appear in parentheses. The
      Declarations shall be as follows:

         (Creates a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes a new
            Rule to come into existance.
         (Amends a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes an
            existing Rule to change wording or form.
         (Repeals a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes an
            existing Rule to cease to exist.
         (Transmutes a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes a
            Mutable Rule to become Immutable, or vice versa.
         (Other) shall be used if no other Declaration has been
            defined which describes the Proposal.

      Additional legislation may define additional legal Declarations
      or change the presentation of the Declaration, but this Rule
      shall take precedence in all other cases.

Rule 455 (Mutable)
Penalty for Improper or Lacking Declarations

      Declaration, as described in other legislation, shall be guilty
      of a Class C Crime.  Any Player who submits a Proposal which
      includes a Declaration which has not been approved by
      legislation shall be guilty of a Class A Crime.

      While On Hold, a Player may not communicate with any other
      Player in any way regarding the Game, with the exception of
      notifying the Speaker of the desire to stop being On Hold. This
      prohibits the Player from Voting, proposing Proposals,

      that he forfeits.  When a player forfeits, he remains registered
      for a length of time equal to the longest possible voting period
      on a proposal. At the end of this time, he is deregistered.
 
      During the time between forfeiting and being deregistered, the
      player may not vote or make a proposal.  The player
      automatically refuses any selection for judgement, or any other

      restrictions are instantly revoked, and the deregistration does

      but there is no source for those Marks, then the Rule shall have
      no legal force. If the Rule does state a source for the Marks,
      but that source does not Possess enough Marks, then all the

      Player. If a Player leaves the Game, whatever Marks are in their
      possession are destroyed. If that same Player later joins the
      Game again, they shall not recieve any Marks.

      The number of each type of Currency owned by each player or
      other Nomic entity must be non-negative, and must be an integer.

               currently has.

      If a Proposal seeks to Amend or Repeal a Rule, that Proposal
      must refer to that Rule either by that Rule's number or by its
      Title as given in the latest distributed Current Rule Set.
      If a Proposal seeks to Amend a Rule, that Proposal must
      explicitly state how in one of two ways: Either the Proposal
      must restate the entire Rule, or the Proposal must quote the
      phrases or words to be deleted (if any) and the phrases or words
      to be inserted (as well as the location of such insertion) or

      the Proposal fails, that person may not be nominated for the
      same Patent Title for a period of 4 weeks.  If the Rule which
      creates the Patent Title specifies another method of assigning
      the Patent Title, then that Rule shall take precedence over

      Judgement must satisfy one or more of the following conditions:

          - clearly allege that a specific Move is illegal;
          - clearly allege that a specific Rule is illegal or lacking
            in legal force, in whole or in part;
          - clearly allege that a specific Rule ought to be
            interpreted in a certain way.
          - clearly allege that the current published game state is
            incorrect, and in what respects.

      A CFJ which does not satisfy at least one of the above
      conditions shall be deemed invalid and shall not be accepted for

========================================

Rule 663 (Mutable)
Injunctions--General

663.  General Rules For Injunctions

      There shall be an entity known as an Injunction, which may
      accompany certain Judgements of TRUE or FALSE as provided in the
      rules. An Injunction is a statement or series of statements
      specifying an action or actions which must take place. If a
      Judgement is is accompanied by an Injunction, that Injunction
      must be published with the Judgement. All players must abide by
      the Injunction beginning no later than 72 hours after its
      publication unless one of the following conditions then apply:
        - The Judgement which the Injunction accompanies is undergoing
          appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of the appeal
          process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but a proposal
          has been published which would overturn that decision if
          passed, and said proposal has not failed.
        - The validity of the Injunction itself is questioned by a
          pending CFJ.
        - A Judgement upholding the validity of the Injunction is
          undergoing appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of
          the appeal process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but
          a proposal has been published which would overturn that
          decision if passed, and said proposal has not failed.

      A Judgement may not be accompanied by an Injunction unless it is
      specifically permitted elsewhere in the rules. An Injunction
      must be completely consistent with all rules in effect at the
      time of issuance, and must be completely relevant to the matter
      addressed in the corresponding judgement.

      If any Player believes that an Injunction or any part of it does
      not meet the criteria for a valid Injunction, e may submit a CFJ
      to that effect. If the resulting Judgement supports the
      contention that the criteria are not met, the Injunction shall
      be considered illegal and shall have no legal force.

      This rule takes precedence over all rules governing Injunctions.

========================================

Rule 664 (Mutable)

Injuction--Retracting an Illegal Move

      Judgement supports the allegation, the Judge may include with
      the Judgement an Injunction specifying that the move is to be
      retracted, and any resulting adjustments to the published game
      state. The adjustments to the game state must have been
      unambiguously specified within the CFJ, and these adjustments
      must only undo actions which were a direct or indirect result of
      that Move.

Rule 710 (Mutable)
Criminal Court

710.  Criminal Court Amendment

      If a Player has been formally Accused of a Crime and that Player
      denies that a Crime was committed, or the Accused Player does
      not respond to the Accusation within 72 hours, or within 72
      hours of the time that the Accused Player ceases to be On Hold,
      should e be On Hold when the Accusation is made, then the
      Accusing Player may call for Criminal Court. To do so, the
      Accusing Player shall notify the Clerk of the Courts of the
      intent to begin Criminal Court and shall send a copy of the
      Accusation to the Clerk of the Courts.
      A Judge is then selected exactly as in the case of a call for
      Judgement, and Players are notified exactly as in the case of a
      call for Judgement, except that the reasons for the Guilt of the
      Accused need not be distributed to all Players, only the
      Accusing Player, the Accused, and the Crime. When a Judge has
      been finally selected, the Clerk of the Courts shall notify the
      Accusing and the Accused Player of the identity of the Judge.

      As soon as the Accused Player, who shall be known as the
      Defendant, and the Accusing Player, who shall be known as the
      Prosecuter, have been notified of the identity of the Judge who
      has accepted the appointment, they shall both send all pertinent
      information regarding this Crime to the Judge. When each party
      has sent all information, they shall indicate so by explicitly
      stating such in their last message to the Judge. The Judge then
      has one week from the time at which both such messgaes have been
      recieved to return a Verdict, following all Rules exactly as if
      returning a Judgement in the case of a call for Judgement. The
      Judge shall not return a Verdict until at least 72 hours after
      the identity of the Judge is announced so that other interested
      Players can also send information to the Judge.

      A Verdict may be GUILTY, NOT GUILTY, or UNDECIDED. If the
      Verdict is GUILTY, then the Defendant shall suffer all the
      penalties relevant to the Class of Crime of which e was found
      GUILTY. If the Verdict is NOT GUILTY, then there shall be no
      effect. If the Verdict is UNDECIDED, then it shall be as if
      there had been no Criminal Court.  A Criminal Court may be
      Appealed exactly as a Call for Judgement may be Appealed,
      except that all information pertinent to the Court shall be
      given to all involved in the Appeal, and if the Appeal OVERRULES
      the Verdict, then the process of a Criminal Court shall occur
      again automatically.
      If other Rules designate another Appeals system for a Criminal
      Court, those Rules shall take precedence over this Rule.

Rule 713 (Mutable)
Welfare

713.  Welfare Reform

      There shall be a quantity known as the Poverty Line, which shall
      be equal to 20% of the average score of all Active Players. If
      any active Player's score is less than the Poverty Line at the
      beginning of the Nomic Week, then each such active Player's
      score shall be increased to the Poverty Line by transferring
      points from the Point Reserve, provided there are sufficient
      points therein to cover all such transfers.

      A Player shall not receive points under this rule if e
      voluntarily transferred points to another Player during the
      previous Nomic Week.

      the given Name and Initial Set of Ordinances (if one was
      included), and the three Players who sent Applications as
      Members of that Group.  The Registrar shall then post in the

      A Player not affiliated with any Group may become a Member of a
      Group at any time after Registration of the Group only as
      specified in that Group's Ordinances, so long as they do not
      conflict with the rules.  However, other rules may establish
      other restrictions on Group Membership, and no Player shall
      become a Member of a Group without eir sending such a request to
      the Vizier of that Group.

      A Player may never be a Member of more than one Group.

========================================

Rule 721 (Mutable)
The Ordinances, and Defaults

721.  The Ordinances, and Defaults

      All Members of a Group must obey the Ordinances of that Group at
      all times, so long as the Ordinances do not conflict with the
      Rules.

      The Ordinances of a Group may specify:

      1.   how the Ordinances of that Group may be changed, or that
      they may not be changed.  If the Ordinances do not so specify,
      then the Ordinances shall be changed only upon unanimous
      agreement of all Members of that Group.

      2.  the Vizier of the Group, so long as the Vizier is a Member
      of that Group.  If the Ordinances of a Group do not so specify,
      the Vizier shall be the Player whose Application for that Group
      was received first by the Registrar, if e is still a Member of
      that Group.

      3.  the Ordinancekeepor of the Group, so long as the
      Ordinancekeepor is a Member of that Group.  If the Ordinances do
      not so specify, then the Vizier of that Group shall also be its
      Ordinancekeepor.

      4.  How the Points or Currencies in the Group's Treasury shall
      be spent, so long as it does not conflict with the Rules.  A

      Player.  When Points or Currencies are to be spent from the
      Group's Treasury, the Vizier of that Group shall inform the
      Scorekeepor or Recordkeepor for the Currency, as is appropriate.

========================================

Rule 724 (Mutable)
Winning the Game

724.  Requirements for Winning

      The Winner is the first Voter to achieve sufficiently many
      Points.  The minimum number of Points required for Player X to
      win is 10*N*(1+G/6), where N is the number of Players currently
      registered in the Game, and G is the number of Games which
      Player X has already won.  If more than one Voter achieves this
      condition simultaneously, then all such Voters win.  When a Game
      ends in this manner:
        - If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the new
          Speaker and the old Speaker becomes a Voter.
        - If there is more than one Winner, the Voter with the highest Point
          total becomes the new Speaker.  If more than one Voter is
          tied for the highest score, the old Speaker randomly selects
          one of them to become the new Speaker.  The old Speaker
          becomes a voter.
        - All Player's scores are reset to 0.
        - A new Game is begun.  All Rules and Proposals retain the
          status they had at the end of the old Game.

========================================

Rule 725 (Mutable)
Stocks

725.  Timing of Stock point transfer.

      Let there be for each Player one Currency called X Stock,
      where X is the name of the Player.

      On Friday Noon GMT 5% of the Points of Player X (with a minimum
      of two Points) shall be transfered to the Player (or Players)
      who holds Stock X.

      At the passing of this Proposal the Bank has possession of all
      Stocks.  During the following week the Banker shall collect the
      bids in Marks.  Those bids have to be made by the Players
      (either alone or acting together on the same Stock) in a message
      to the server.  No bid shall be made, which can not be covered
      by the Marks in  he bidders Bank account (to be verified by the
      Banker.)

      After one week each of the Stocks shall be transfered from the
      Bank to the highest bidder. If two or more bids for Stock X are
      exactly equal, the Stock shall go to player X (if one of the
      highest bidders), or to the Player with the lowest score.

      If a given Stock X is bought by Player X, the Marks of the bid
      shall be transfered from Player X to the Bank.
      If a given Stock X is bought by another Player (or Players) then
      Player X, the Marks of the bid shall go from this Player(s) to
      Player X.

      The Banker shall keep track of the Stocks held by each Player.

========================================

Rule 726 (Mutable)
Starting Points and No Unpermitted Point Changes

726.  Initial scores

      All Players begin with 0 Points, except that new Voters who
      enter part-way through a Game in progress shall be given the
      average of the scores of all active Players scores, not
      including those scores, which happen to be negative.
      Points may not be gained, lost, or traded except as explicitly
      stated in the Rules.

========================================

Rule 728 (Mutable)
Destruction of and Compensation for Stocks of Leaving Players

728.  Stocks of leaving Players I

      When Player X leaves the game, Stock X shall be destroyed.
      If Stock X was held at that time by another Player, this Player
      shall be compensated with half the price in Marks that this
      Player paid for the Stock X.
      These Marks shall come from the account of Player X, *before*
      those shall be destroyed, as required by other Rules.
      If there are not enough Marks available, the deficit shall be
      paid by the Bank.
      This Rule applies to the Stock of Players that have left the
      game before adoption of this Proposal.

Rule 732 (Mutable)
Conversion of Points to Marks at Game End

732.  Conversion into Marks at game end:

      When a Game ends the Points of all Players with a positive score
      shall be converted into Marks in a ratio of 25 Points for one
      Mark.  The number of Marks necessary for this conversion shall
      be created.

========================================

Rule 733 (Mutable)
Default Rules for Officers

733.  Default Rules for Officers

      An Official is any Player who has been Appointed or Elected to
      an Office specified in the Rules. A Judge is not an Officer.
      An Officer may be replaced by another Player, by a Proposal
      stating so, and that Proposal passes.
      An Officer may resign at any time, provided e appoints a
      successor.
      If an Officer resigns while a Proposal is being voted upon to
      replace eim, the Player proposed will by eis Successor.
      This Rule applies to general Offices, and therefore defers to
      Rules for specific Offices.
      Running for office

========================================

Rule 736 (Mutable)
The Marxist

736.  The Marxist

      Let there be the Patent Title known as "Marxist", which is
      awarded to the Player with the most Marks, or if tied, to the
      Players with the most Marks. Only the current richest Player
      or Players may hold this title.

      The determination and announcement of assignment and revoking
      of the Title is made by the Banker, who must use the most
      accurate means of determining this available to eim, and must
      make the announcement as soon as possible after becoming aware
      of a change in holder of the Title.

      However: To respect some Players' wish for privacy, and in
      view of the secret nature of Marks accounts, a prospective
      Marxist must first be asked if e wants the Title. If not, then
      instead of announcing, "Player x is granted the Patent Title of
      'Marxist', e announces, "Patent Title of 'Marxist' is granted
       to an anonymous Player".

========================================

Rule 747 (Mutable)
Definition of a Conserved Quantity

747.  Definition of a Conserved Quantity

      An Entity is only a Conserved Quantity if a Rule explicitly
      states such. A Conserved Quantity may only be Created or
      Destroyed as explicitly stated by the Rules. If a Conserved
      Quantity is given to an Entity, and no Rule states where that
      Conserved Quantity is to be taken from, then the transfer shall
      not take place. If a Conserved Quantity is taken from an Entity,
      and no Rule states where that Conserved Quantity is to be
      transfered to, then the Conserved Quantity shall be transfered
      to the Bank.

========================================

Rule 748 (Mutable)
Don't Count Blank or Required Lines in Proposal Length

748.  Whitespace in a Rule

      Whenever the length of a Proposal is determined, any blank lines
      within that Proposal shall not be counted towards the number of

      shall likewise not be counted towards the number of lines in
      that Proposal.

      be selected by the designated Sweepstakes Officer, and the Voter
      who owns that Entry shall receive 1 Point per Entry by any other
      Player into the Lottery. For purposes of this Rule, a week
      shall begin on Monday at 12:00 am and shall last seven days,
      until Sunday at 11:59 pm, in the time zone in which the

      shall also be Amended as follows.
      1.  If the last line of text of the Rule begins with '(*' and
      ends with '*)' then the characters '/@' shall be inserted
      immediately before the final '*)'.
      2.  If the last line of text of the Rule does not begin with
      '(*' and end with '*)' then the following line of text shall be
      appended to the text of the Rule:  '(*Was: @*)'.
      3.  After clauses 1. and 2. above have been applied, the '@'
      which appears in the last line of text of the Rule shall be
      replaced with the Number of the Rule which was Amended by the

Spelling and Grammar Errors

754.  Spelling and Grammar Errors

      Differences in spelling, grammar, or dialect, or the
      substitution of a word or phrase by a synonym or abbreviation,
      are inconsequential in all forms of Nomic communication, as long
      as there is no ambiguity in meaning. In other words, the meaning
      or validity of such communication is not altered in any way by
      such discrepancies.

      When, for any reason, the owner of a Nomic entity is to be
      determined by an Auction, this Auction shall be conducted by an
      Auctioneer, who shall be the Banker, the Banker's chosen willing
      delegate, or any other player as specified in other rules.
 
      Once the identity of the Auctioneer is determined, the Auction
      begins with the Auctioneer making an announcement to the game
      forum stating what  Nomic entity is up for Auction, and that e
      is accepting bids.

      Players who wish to participate in the Auction then must
      indicate their interest by sending a bid to the Auctioneer.
 
      The list of players who have indicated an interest is not
      secret, and if it is not included as part of the Auctioneer's
      Announcements the Auctioneer must share it on demand.

Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal

761.  Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal: Adjusting for Abstentions

      When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the Votes which
      have been legally cast shall be counted by the Speaker. If a
      Proposal is not Contested, and there are more FOR votes cast
      then AGAINST votes, then that Proposal shall take effect.  If
      such a Proposal has an equal number of FOR and AGAINST Votes,
      then the Speaker shall decide whether the Proposal shall be
      Adopted, or if that Proposal shall fail. If the Proposal is
      Contested, and the number of FOR votes cast is at least twice
      the number of AGAINST votes cast, then that Proposal shall take
      effect.

      If a Rule will change the actions required of or forbidden to
      the Speaker, and the Speaker opposed the Proposal, then that
      Proposal shall be considered Contested. The Speaker shall
      declare if e opposes the Proposal when e distributes the
      Proposal.

Player Gets a Share of the Treasury Upon Leaving the Group

762.  Shared Group Accounts

      If, for any reason, Player X ceases to be a Member of Group Y,
      then Player X shall recieve a share of the contents of the Y
      Treasury as specified in the Y Ordinances.  If the Y Ordinances
      are silent on this issue, or if Group Y has ceased to exist,
      then 1/N times the contents of the Y Treasury, rounded
      downwards, shall be transferred to Player X, where N is the
      number of Members of Group Y immediately before Player X ceased
      to be a Member of Group Y.  This transfer is not taxable, and
      may incude a negative number of Points.  This Rule takes
      precedence over all other Rules which determine which Point and
      Currency transfers are legal and/or taxable.

      Immediately before Group X ceases to exist, a number of Points
      equal to two times the number of X Coins in existence at that
      moment shall be removed from the X Treasury, and then all of
      the X Coins shall be converted to Points, at the rate of two

Rule 764 (Mutable)
Mischief

764.  Mischief

      Any Player or Group X may perform an Act of Mischief directed
      at any Player or Group Y.  The permissible forms of Mischief
      are defined in other Rules; such definitions must include a
      positive Price in Coins, or the form of Mischief is not
      permissible.  This Rule explicitly takes precedence over all
      other Rules which purport to determine which forms of Mischief
      are permissible.

      To cause an Act of Mischief,  X  sends to the Public Forum a
      message containing:
      - the Name of the object, Y;
      - the effect of the Act of Mischief;
      - the Number of the Rule which permits the form of Mischief;
      - indication of which Coins in X's account will be used as
      payment for the Act of Mischief.  Coins of Group Y, or the
      Group to which Player Y belongs, may not be used as payment.

      The effect of the Act of Mischief is applied immediately upon
      publication of the above message in the Forum.  An additional
      effect of this Act of Mischief is that
      - for each Coin of Group Z spent as payment above, two Points
      are removed from the Z Treasury;
      - the Coins used as payment above are removed from X's account
      and destroyed.

Rule 766 (Mutable)
Groups

766.  Amend Rule 714.

      A Group is initially formed by a set of Players which has
      registered with the Registrar to form a Group; other Players may
      join later.  Each Group has a Name, a Membership, a Vizier,
      an Ordinancekeepor, a Treasury, an Initial Set of Ordinances,
      and an associated form of Currency, called the <name> Coins,
      where <name> is the Name of the Group.

      1.  The Name may not be the Name of another Group.

      2.  The Membership is a set of Players;  these Players are
      Members of the Group, and all other Players are not.

      3.  Synchronously with the registration of a Group, two Offices
      are created known as the <name> Vizier, and the <name>
      Ordinancekeepor, where <name> is the Name of the Group.
      These Offices may never be empty, and the <name> Vizier and
      <name> Ordinancekeepor must both be a member of <name> Group.
      The <name> Vizier shall inform the Registrar whenever the
      Membership or the Ordinancekeepor of the <name> group changes.
      When the <name> Vizier changes, the new Vizier shall inform the
      Registrar of the change.
      The <name> Ordinancekeepor shall keep an accurate and current
      record of the Ordinances of the <name> Group.

      4.  The Treasury is a repository for Points and Currencies and
      has the same capabilities for holding, trading, and spending
      Points and Currencies as does a Player.

      5.  The Ordinances are a description of the operation of the
      Group.

      6.  The <name> Coins are a form of Currency which is created
      synchronously with the registration of the Group.  The <name>
      Group may create <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be
      placed in the <name> Treasury.  The <name> Group may destroy
      <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be removed from the
      <name> Treasury.

Rule 767 (Mutable)
Votes for Groups

767.  Amend Rule 646.

      If a Group has N Members then it has N Votes for each
      Proposal in addition to those of its Membership.  The
      Ordinances of a Group may determine how and when the Group
      casts its Votes; if the Ordinances are silent on this issue
      then the Group may not cast its Votes.  The Votes of the
      Group are cast when the Vizier sends a message to the Speaker
      to that effect during the Voting Period and this action is
      legitimate insofar as the Ordinances are concerned.

Rule 779 (Mutable)
Sanity

779.  Sanity

      When a Player submits a Proposal, e may pay one Mark to the Bank
      (if e has at least one Mark) and impose Sanity on that Proposal.
      E must inform both the Banker and the Speaker when doing so.
      A Proposal which has Sanity imposed upon it is known as a Sane
      Proposal.  The Speaker shall, when e distributes a Sane
      Proposal, inform the Players that it is a Sane Proposal.

      No non-Voter Nomic entity may Vote on a Sane Proposal.  Each
      Voter shall have exactly one Vote on a Sane Proposal, and
      each Voter's Vote shall be counted exactly once on a Sane
      Proposal.

      This rule takes precedence over any rule allowing a non-Voter
      Nomic entity to Vote; over any rule which gives any Voter
      more or less than one Vote on a proposal; and over any
      rule which would cause any Voter's Vote to be counted more or
      less than once.

Rule 781 (Mutable)
Formal Apologies

781.  Formal Apologies

      If a Player (herein called the Squealer) makes a Call For
      Judgement alleging that a Player (herein called the Ninny) has
      acted or has failed to act in such a way as to be in violation
      of one or more Rules, and this CFJ is Judged TRUE, then the
      Judge must issue an Injunction that the Ninny submit a Formal
      Apology.  This Injunction may also include a list of up to ten
      Prescribed Words.  By a Formal Apology is meant a letter of at
      least 200 words, containing all of the Prescribed Words,
      explaining the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
      for self-improvement, and posted in the Public Forum.  Within 48
      hours of the posting of this Formal Apology, the Squealer must
      either submit a Proposal that the Ninny's Apology be accepted,
      or submit a Proposal that the Ninny's Aplology be rejected,
      but not both.  No other Player may submit such a Proposal, and
      the Squealer may submit only one.  If a Proposal to accept the
      Apology fails, or if a Proposal to reject the Apology passes,
      then the Ninny loses 5 Points.

Rule 785 (Mutable)
Abandonment of Speakerhood

785.  Improve Speaker Succession I

      If the Speaker has abandoned eir post, another new, Temporary
      Speaker is selected according to the "Rules of Succession", or
      if no such rules are defined, the other Player not on hold with
      the highest Score becomes the temporary Speaker.  This does not
      force the Game to be over in this case, and Scores are not reset
      to 0. The Game continues until a Player Wins, at which time a
      new Game is begun and the Winner becomes the real Speaker. The
      Temporary Speaker shall make reasonable effort to obtain the
      former Speaker's materials: proposal queue, voting records, etc.
      but if this is not possible, then the Temporary Speaker shall
      request that these be resubmitted by the Players. If a Speaker
      is replaced in this manner, e has eir score set to minus 2N
      Points immediately, where N is the number of Points required for
      a Player to Win the Game.

      Abandonment is determined as follows: If any Player suspects
      that the Speaker has Abandoned, e sends a message to all Players
      calling on the Speaker to announce eir presence.  The Speaker
      must reply to all Players within one week; if e does not, e is
      considered to have Abandoned.

      Clerk of the Courts
      Rulekeepor
      Distributor
      <all other Officers in descending Point order>
      <all other Voters in descending Point order>

      When a replacement Speaker is required, all Players who are
      willing to become Speaker shall indicate such in a message, sent
      within three days of the Abandonment or resignation of the
      Speaker.  The old Speaker may not send such a message.  This
      message shall be sent to the Speaker, in the case of a Speaker
      voluntarily giving up his position; or to the first Player who
      called for the Speaker to announce his presence, in the case of
      an Abandoned Speaker.

      After three days, the Player ranking highest on the list
      of succession, out of those who indicated a willingness to
      become Speaker, shall become Speaker.

Injunctions on Interpretations of Rules

789.  Injunction: Interpretation of a Rule

      When a player makes a CFJ alleging that a Rule should be
      interpreted in a certain way, e shall also submit a list of
      Rules relevant to that CFJ, which must include the Rule in
      question.  If the statement is Judged TRUE, the Judge may
      include with the Judgement an Injuction requiring the Rulekeepor
      to annotate the Rule in question with the Statement in the CFJ
      and the list of relevant Rules.

      The annotation shall remain only until one of the Rules
      in the list of relevant Rules is amended, repealed, or
      transmuted; or until a CFJ determines that the injunction no
      longer applies, as described below.  While it remains, it shall
      guide the application of that Rule.

      If a Player believes that the circumstances which led to the
      Judgement no longer prevail and the annotation is therefore no
      longer applicable, e may submit a CFJ to that effect. If it is
      Judged TRUE, the annotation shall be stricken from the rule set.

      end of the three day period, the Electioneer shall randomly

      The Speaker shall enforce this by delaying the distribution of
      Proposals in excess of this number. This Rule takes precedence,

      this until at least 24 hours after the Proposal queue was last
      closed. As soon as this notification appears on the Public
      Forum, Players are prohibited from submitting any more
      Proposals, and the Speaker shall refuse to accept any which are
      inadvertently submitted.

      When the number of Proposals up for Vote has dropped to PL/2 or

Sorry, chum.  You can only bid in increments of 0.1 Mark.  Like this:

I bid 1.7 Marks for Ian Stock.

Whoops, did I do that?  :)

P.S.  I'll retract my bid if you get rid of that obnoxious .sig...  :)

I got the same message about my bid of 0.21 Marks, but I have sent hir the
message I sent to the list (without comment so far, but it's only been an
hour or so... =)

How 'bout this: Until we hear otherwise from the Bankor, we'll assume that
sie's correct on this (I mean, sie is the Bankor! =). So that means that
your bid of 1.7 Marks was indeed the highest (valid?) bid until two lines
after this one.

I bid 1.8 Marks for Ian Stock.

How's that?

Here is the ruling on CFJ 115.
   Clerk Jeffrey S.

===
*CFJ 115 (Chuck)

*Submitted: Wed Feb 16 03:26:05 1994

*The Judge shall be:  Oerjan
*Scorekeepor:  Ruling received within 72 hours, please credit accordingly.

*Statement to be Judged:
Rule 101 has no legal force.
Relevant Rules: 101, 111, 212.

*Decisoion of Judge:  FALSE

*Reasoning for CFJ:
Argument:
I will show that the assumption that 101 does have legal force
leads to a paradox.  Thus, 101 does not have legal force.

Rule 101 says that players must obey *all* Rules, always.  It does not
say, "obey the Rules, unless they conflict and one takes precedence
over another, in which case the latter need not be obeyed."

Rule 111 and Rule 212 both specify cases where Rules conflict and
one or the other is not obeyed.  However, by Rule 101 both conflicting
Rules must be obeyed.  And it does no good to say that Rule 111 and/or
Rule 212 have no effect, for by Rule 101 they must be obeyed as well!

For example: suppose Rules 994 and 996 conflict, and 996 claims
precedence over 994.  By Rule 212, 996 has precedence, and (implicitly)
994 does not have to be followed.  But, by Rule 101, *both* Rules must
be followed.  (And you cannot say that 212 is null and void because
it conflicts with 101, because by 101 Rule 212 must also be obeyed.)

Paradox!  If Rule 101 has legal force you must obey both conflicting
Rules; and you must obey as well a Rule which says to ignore one of
the conflicting Rules.  Thus, the only conclusion is that Rule 101
does *not* have legal force.

(You can come up with even more tangled and twisted paradoxes looking only
at 101, 111, and 212 without even going to other conflicting Rules.
The only way out of the paradox is if 101 does not have legal force.)

(Note that by Rule 789, the Judge may issue an Injunction if e
finds this CFJ TRUE.)

(I believe this (if judged TRUE) does not present as great a problem
for the game as might appear at first glance.  Consider that by
game custom, we follow all rules *except* when Rules conflict with
each other.)

Relevant Rules:
===================
Rule 101 (Immutable)
Obey the Rules

101.  All Players must always abide by all the Rules then in effect,
      in the form in which they are then in effect.  The Rules in the
      Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the first game.
      The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (Immutable) and
      201-219 (Mutable).

=============
Rule 111 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Conflicts

111.  In a conflict between a Mutable and an Immutable Rule, the
      immutable Rule takes precedence and the Mutable Rule shall be
      entirely void.  For the purposes of this Rule a Proposal to
      Transmute an Immutable Rule does not "conflict" with that
      Immutable Rule.
 
==================
Rule 212 (Mutable)
Resolving Rule Conflicts

212.  If two or more Mutable Rules conflict with one another, or if
      two or more Immutable Rules conflict with one another, then the
      Rule with the lowest ordinal Number takes precedence.
        If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of rule) or takes
      precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.
        If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

*Rationale for Judgement:
101 says that Players must obey all Rules then in effect. A Rule which
is entirely null and void is not in effect; nor is a Rule over which has
been taken precedence in a conflict, at least not in its written form.
Therefore Chuck's argument fails.

*CFJ 117 (KoJen)

*Submitted for Judgement:  Fri Feb 18 08:50:02 1994
*Scorekeepor:  Judgement received within 72 hours, please credit accordingly.

*Judge shall be:  Oerjan

*Statement to be Judged:
Jeffrey broke Rule 206 by Voting on Prop 818 while he was Speaker.

*Decision of Judge:  FALSE

*Rationale given for CFJ:

  Rule 206 (Mutable)
  One Voter, One Vote

  206.

        Each Voter has exactly one Vote.  The Speaker may not Vote.

Jeffrey sent his voting choices to me on 2/7/94 while I was Speaker and
he was a Voter. However, this did not become a Vote until the instant before
the end of the Voting period. Clearly this is so because Game Custom allows a
Voter to submit multiple conflicting voting choices during a Voting period, and
only the last one is considered valid. Since "Game Entities May not be
Arbitrarily Changed" (Rule 450), it is clear that these voting choices are not
Votes until the end of the Voting period, when there is no longer any
possibility of changing them. Since Jeffrey became Speaker on 2/8/94
and the Vote became effective on 2/11/94, it is clear that he violated
Rule 206.

It should be noted that this situation is the opposite of that covered by Rule
457: Voting of the ex-Speaker. That Rule covers the Voting rights of a Speaker
who becomes a Voter, whereas in this opposite situation the issue is the Voting
rights of a Voter who becomes a Speaker. 

  Rule 457 (Mutable)
  Voting of the ex-Speaker

  457.  Voting of the ex-Speaker:

        If a Player ceases to be the Speaker, and then becomes a Voter,
        that Player may not Vote on any Proposal whose Voting Period
        began while that Player was still the Speaker. This Rule takes
        precedence over any other Rule which indicates who may or may
        not Vote.

Although there is no Rule specifically addressing the current situation, it is
clearly and unmistakingly apparent from considering the totality of the Rule
Set and well-established Game Custom that Jeffrey's action was illegal.

*Additional stuff attached to Rational for CFJ:
Therefore, I am recommending that the judge accompany eir decision of TRUE with
an injunction which includes the following:

* Adjustment of the Rule Set to reflect the consequent non-passage of Prop 818.

* Adjustment of Marks accounts to undo the effects of any Walruses.

* Adjustment of Points accounts to undo the effects of any Walruses.

* Adjustment of Jeffrey's Points account to remove the Point he received from
Voting. 

* Adjustment of Waggie's Points account to reflect the non-passage of Prop 818.

* Adding an annotation to Rule 206 stating that the prohibition against the
Speaker's voting includes the situation where e becomes Speaker while a
Proposal's Voting period is ongoing, because a Vote is not official until the
moment before the end of the Voting period.

* A demand for an apology by Jeffrey containing 10 words of the Judges choice,
per Rule 781.

*Rationale of Judgement:
Justification: The act of Voting happens at the time of the message
to the Speaker, and at that moment Jeffrey S. clearly was not
The Speaker. The implications of Voting is to make or change a Vote, and
whereas the Vote is not counted until the end of the Voting Period, no
Voting is required at that moment as the Vote has already been decided.
Whereas Jeffrey would be prohibited from Voting, i.e. making or changing
his Votes after he became Speaker, he is not prohibited from already
having Voted at that point.
Clearly this is the correct interpretation, as otherwise the legality
of this action would depend on events after the action took place, of which
Jeffrey S. could have only limited control.

*CFJ 118 (Stella?)

*Submitted for Judgement:  Fri Feb 18 04:02:33 1994
*Scorekeepor:  Judgement received w/in 72 hours, please credit accordingly.

*Judge shall be:  Vlad

*Statement to be Judged:
When a Player leaves the Game, he/she obviously is no longer a Player.
The phrase "same Player later joins the Game again" (Rule 518) is
therefore a logical impossibility.

*Decision of Judge:  FALSE

*Rationale for CFJ:
Consequently, even if the same *person* rejoins the Game, he/she still
has the right on a starting capital of three Marks.

Rule 518 for reference:
518.  Starting Marks

      Upon the passage of this Rule, 3 Marks shall be created for
      every Player in the Game, and given to those Players. If a new
      Player joins the Game, 3 Marks are created and given to that
      Player. If a Player leaves the Game, whatever Marks are in their
      possession are destroyed. If that same Player later joins the
      Game again, they shall not recieve any Marks.

*Rationale for Decision:
Reasoning: A Player is a person who plays Nomic (not
any game of Nomic, but this game, however the word "this"
is a bit ambiguous, and there can be confusion between
the game in its continuing sense, and each individual Game
within it, so I eschew that terminology). If a Player quits
the game, and rejoins, he/she is still the same "Player",
as he/she is still the same person, and is playing the same game.
The name he/she uses makes no difference.

*CFJ 116 (Alice)

*Submitted:  Wed Feb 16 13:18:39 1994

*The Judge shall be:  Garth
*Scorekeepor:  Judgement received w/in 72 hrs., Please credit accordingly.

*Statement to be Judged:
The Clerk of Courts, Jeffrey, moved illegally by accepting a CFJ which is 
invalid (violation of Rule 662).  

*Decision of Judge:  TRUE

*Reasoning for CFJ:
Despite the fact that CFJ 111 was submitted to Public Forum and should
not have even been considered in the first place (Rule 407), the statement
"The Banker erred in announcing..." does NOT *clearly* *allege* that the 
given move was *illegal*, in fact, it merely implies 
that Banker KoJen made a mistake, which may or may not have been illegal.  The 
invocation of Judgement must satisfy at least one of the conditions declared 
in Rule 662, and by Rule 407, the invocation consists of the  Statement 
submitted, and not of any arguements that may accompany it.  When an error is 
made by any entity, that does NOT clearly imply that it is illegal.  Thusly, 
since CFJ 111 does not meet any of the requirements as outlined in Rule 662, 
it is deemed invalid. 

*Rationale for Decision:
Alice's argument is ironclad;  Rule 662 is VERY specific.  Initially, I had
some trouble with it, due to the prior CFJ 110, which also used the form
"erred" in the Statement.  However, I feel that in that context the word 
"erred" *does* "clearly allege that the current published game state is
incorrect" (Rule 662), so it does not conflict with my above Judgement.
I append CFJ 110 for reference.  Personally, I think that the Player who
Called For Judgement should be held responsible, rather than the CotC,
but the Ruleset is quite clear.  Therefore:

Rule 781 requires me to issue the following Injunction:

*Injunctions issued by Judge:
Clerk of the Courts Jeffrey S. shall submit a Formal Apology for violating
Rule 662.  The Formal Apology shall contain the following Prescribed Words:

groveling, abasement, unworthy, Cthulhu, calendrical, quixotic, calories,
antidisestablishmentarianism, aardvark, zymurgy

*Additional message from the Judge:
As long as injustice is to perpetrated via the Ruleset, we might as well be
entertained.  :)

Proposals that I have lost please resubmit and I will process
/immediately/.  I suppose you can also send along a CFJ, and I

Anyway, here come the new ones.  Old ones will be processed soon.

And regarding my priorities as listed earlier this week...
Responding to injunctions is not even close to significant, unless
of course, Y'all would rather have me follow those /instead/ of
processing Proposals and CFJs.  :)

PROPOSAL 843 (KoJen)

Limits On Proposals Sent To Speaker
(creates a Rule)

No Player may send more than PL/2 Proposals to the Speaker during any
given Week.  Proposals in excess of this number are rejected by the
Speaker, as they are not "made in the proper manner". A 2 Point
penalty is assessed by the Speaker for every Proposal submitted in
excess of this number; responsibility for enforcement is given to the
Speaker.

[Justification: This is an additional regulation on the Proposal
Queue, in response to complaints that the current situation could lead
to one individual clogging the queue. Existing Rule 791 imposes a
total proposal limit of 15. Rule 792 imposes "Xon-Xoff protocol" on
the proposal queue, to attempt to keep the queue size of
received-but-not-yet-distributed proposals manageable. This new
proposal prevents an individual from clogging the queue, while still
allowing a legitimate but prolific player to submit a
higher-than-average number of proposals.]

[The Speaker does not contest this proposal.]
===================

Proposal 844 (Garth)

Overhaul of the Criminal Justice System, Part I
(Repeals a Rule)

Rule 600 is hereby Repealed.

[ This is the Rule that describes how to make a formal Accusation.
It is no longer needed in my new system.  See below.]
===================
Proposal 845 (Garth)

Overhaul of the Criminal Justice System, Part II
(Repeals a Rule)

Rule 602 is hereby Repealed.

[ This is the Rule that says CFJ's are not the mechanism for accusation
of Crimes.  Since this is antithetical to my new system, it goes.]
===================
Proposal 846 (Garth)

Overhaul of the Criminal Justice System, Part III
(Amends a Rule)

Rule 605 is Amended in the following ways:

All instances of the word GUILTY are changed to Guilty.

The following text is added after the word "Crime" in the last sentence:

", and the Player shall suffer any penalties for committing the Crime.
This Rule takes precedence over other Rules that define when a Criminal
Court should be called."

[ Since my amendment to Rule 355 (it's coming!) will define what it
means to be Guilty of a Crime, this Rule can stay.  I didn't get rid of
it because of the timesaver of not having to call Criminal Court when
the Accused admits guilt.]
===================
Proposal 847 (Garth)

Overhaul of the Criminal Justice System, Part IV
(Repeals a Rule)

Rule 710 is hereby Repealed.

[ This Rule's defining function is being incorporated into the old 
Accusation Rule, #355]
===================
Proposal 848 (Garth)

Overhaul of the Criminal Justice System, Part V

Rule 355 is amended in the following ways:

The following text is added after the first sentence:  "Similarly, if a
Player believes that any Player has commited a Crime, e may invoke 
Judgement on a Statement to that effect.  Either kind of Statement is
known as an Accusation.  A Criminal Court is defined as the Judge of an
Accusation."

The second to last sentence is amended after the word "been" to read:
"found Guilty of breaking the Rule or committing the Crime, as applicable."

The last sentence is amended after the word "been" to read:  "found Not
Guilty of breaking the Rule or committing the Crime, as applicable." 

[ Streamlines the Criminal Justice system.  Resolves Crimes via a mechanism
already in the Rules, that of Accusation.  Further, all the useful Rules that
happen to refer to a Criminal Court are retained.]

Foreign Policy Report

I made formal contact with Game Tabula at Reed this week, informing them of
my position and availability for discussion.  I am now subscribed to the
Reed list on behalf of our beloved Game.

Already, a Player of Game Tabula has submitted a Proposal to create a parallel
position, thus formalizing relations.  I look forward to this unprecedented
step in interNomic relations.

I plan to advertise our Game on rec.games.abstract this week.  I will also
request the Players of other Nomics to come forward.  Registar Oerjan has
graciously agreed to maintain a list of Nomics on the Net.  Such a list
may eventually be stored at the frc ftp site.

As part of my effort to simplify Scorekeeping, I am ignoring the Stock
Dividends. I just don't have the time. Feel free to issue a CFJ or to run for
the office of Scorekeepor is you desire. Or if someone else wants to do the
calculations and send them to me, I suppose I could include them.

Before you all start complaining, please consider that in recent weeks
(actually since the beginning of Stocks) I have received the most dividends, so
I hope you all don't mind *too* much.

Specifically, the following transactions were included:

The next change in Scores was due to Welfare as a result of the Walruses. 

The time of the Welfare awards was 2/14. The average Player Score at that time
was -15.5; 20% of the average score was -3.1

(This is really weird, and presumably not what was intended by the creator of
Welfare, due to the fact that the average score is negative.)

Score changes are as follows:

    02/14 > bowen           84.9    ; welfare
    02/14 > chuck           62.4    ; welfare

    02/14 > zibrowski       31.9    ; welfare

bringing the scores after 2/14 welfare application to:

Here are the Proposals I lost in my systems somewhere.  Sorry Garth.

speaker jeffrey s.

==================
Proposal 849 (Garth)

Salaries of Officers
(Creates a Rule)

Officers (excluding Viziers, Ordinancekeepors, and any other Officers
whose duties pertain only to a single Group) shall receive a salary of
3 Points per week.

This Rule applies to Offices in general, and defers to the Rules for
specific Offices.

[ Oerjan's comment that the Registrar does not receive a salary took me
by surprise.  Upon investigating, I found that the Rulekeepor doesn't
either!  This is intolerable, so I'm fixing it, plus preventing the
problem from arising in the future.]
===================
Proposal 850 (Garth)

Good and Bad News for the Scorekeepor
(Amends a Rule)

The sentence of Rule 493 that begins with the word "Salary:" is amended
to read:  "The Offices of Scorekeepor and Auditor may not be held by the
same Player."

[ It seems that Komrade KoJen is a Kapitalist when it Kounts.  :)  E is
Kurrently both Scorekeepor and Auditor.  This is ridiculous.  However,
to encourage eim to resign one of them, note that this rule raises the
salary of the Offices, provided my previous Proposal passes.  Sort of the
carrot and stick approach. :) ]

Just a comment on the Scores of Ian and Stella?. The Rules require that new
Players receive the average of all non-negative Players scores. Out of the 17
Players, 10 of these were negative! With this Rule, it is entirely conceivable
that the situation would arise where a new Player would start out with the
highest Score. As you will see in the following score report, Ian and Stella?
are currently tied for third place, out of 17 Players.

Here are the scores as of 2/24.

This is fun!  I'd like to start a collection of Nomic Koans.  Therefore,
I encourage players to write Nomic Koans and send them to me.  As an
incentive, I will give 0.5 Marks to the best Koan and 0.2 Marks to
the second-best.  Koans must be received by me by 00:00:00 (CST, GMT-6)
Sun, Mar. 6 1994.  Please send Koans directly to me rather than posting
them; I will post *all* entries at the end of the contest.  My own
Koans are ineligible for the prize.  Players may enter as many
times as they wish, but please don't swamp my mailbox with
20 per person!  Put some thought into them.  (2 or 3 per person
is not unreasonable.  20 is.)

(I'd like to start a collection of Koans and post them every month or
so, possibly encouraging people to write them even when there isn't a
contest.)

For those unfamiliar with the form, a Koan is a short Zen "parable"
(for lack of a better term).  They usually tell of
a dialogue between a Zen master and a Zen student, and they usually
end with the enlightenment of the student.  Most of
my knowledge of koans comes from several which Douglas Hofstadter
relates in _Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid_.  I'm
sure there are better sources, but I don't know what they are.

Entries will be judged on:
--how well they show the application of Zen to Nomic, and vice versa.
--Length.  Koans are usually short.  (They can be a *bit* longer if
  they make a particularly important point, but they definitely should
  be able to fit on one screen.)
--Humor, to some extent.  That is, a koan may be humorous (as mine is,
  a little) but a koan is not a joke.  Primarily the humor should
  be from the Zen/Nomic interaction.
--But most importantly, the judging will be subjective.  Naturally,
  my decision is final.

Gentlemen, start your engines!
The Second Tournament of Waggie's World is about to begin.
The registered contestants are

Jeffrey S.
KoJen
Garth  x2
Chuck  x2
Vlad

and anyone else who would like to play is welcome to join.
The entry fee is *at least*  5  Points per entry.  I  accept
Marks as payment at the exchange rate of  25  Points per Mark.

***Remember, your payoff is proportional to your entry fee!***

The game this time will by a three by five matrix.  Thus, each
contestant will have to supply two strategies, one for the
"home team", and one for the "visitors".

48 hours after this posting I will close the registration period
by posting a list of the registered contestants who have paid their
entry fee.  Then I will begin the Tournament by sending the game to
these contestants.  You will have  72  hours to submit your strategies.

Cheers!  and may the most devious scoundrel win!
Waggie
***Play Waggie's World!***
