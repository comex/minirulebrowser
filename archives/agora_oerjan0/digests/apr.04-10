Hey folks!  Here's a message that I sent to the listserv this morning that
is psuedo important so I'm sending it through the distributer since the 
original isn't making it through the listserv (y'know what's really funny about
it?  I'm finally getting messages that I sent last month).

Sorry about going through the distributer but I feel that it is important
enough.

   Upon rechecking my records, I agree that Duane is correct. My poor penmanship
caused me to misread my notes as to who had made the high bid.  Since the
bidding summary I sent out on Friday was correct, no one was mislead into
believing they had the high bid when in fact they did not.   I have corrected
my records.

Here are the Voting results.  There is an apparent irregularity I
am unsure how to handle.  Group PROSIRUP Voted successfully to
cast its Votes on several Proposals, but there is no record of
the PROSIRUP Vizier (Oerjan, at the time) having so informed the
Speaker.  Care to comment, Oerjan, Jeffrey?  It could make a 
difference on some Proposals.  These results assume that
PROSIRUP did not Vote.

Also, the legality of Proposals 876 and 877 is unclear to me; Ian
has pointed out that they exceeded the allotted limit of seven per
Player.  It would appear that they were not submitted "in the proper
way," but it would depend on if they were submitted in the same
Week as the others.  I include the Votes on them for completeness.

PROPOSAL 865 (KoJen)

Incentive For Proto-Proposing
(creates a rule)

Players are urged to "proto-Propose" an idea before submitting it as
an official Proposal. This is done be posting the complete Proposal as
it would be submitted, to the Public Forum, adding the prefix "proto-"
to the word "PROPOSAL", at least one Week and no more than four Weeks
before the Proposal is submitted to the Speaker. The submitter is
encouraged but not required to take into account suggestions by the
Nomic community, and modify the proto-proposal before submitting as an
official Proposal. When proposed in this manner, the Proposer receives
2 Points. The Speaker must mention this payment when e distributes the
Proposal. 

To be eligible for this, the submitter must indicate to the Speaker
when the Proposal was proto-Proposed, and what changes were
incorporated. A Proposal must be a "reasonably plausible evolution" of
its proto-Proposal or this credit does not apply. In case of a
violation, the submitter, and not the Speaker shall be the Guilty
Party.

[Justification: This should improve the quality of Proposals somewhat
by encouraging discussion.]

PROPOSAL 866 (KoJen)
Incentive For Proto-Proposing to Group
(creates a rule)

Players are urged to "proto-Propose" an idea before submitting it as
an official Proposal. Should the Proposer desire, e may decide to
proto-Propose it to eir own Group rather than to the Public
Forum. This is done by Posting the complete Proposal as it would be
submitted, to all Active members of eir Group, adding the prefix
"proto-" to the word "PROPOSAL", at least one Week and no more then
four Weeks before the Proposal is submitted to the Speaker. The
submitter is encouraged but not required to take into account
suggestions by the Group members, and modify the proto-proposal before
submitting as an official Proposal. When proposed in this manner, the
Proposer receives 2 Points. The Speaker must mention this payment when
e distributes the Proposal.

To be eligible for this, the submitter must indicate to the Speaker
when and to whom the Proposal was proto-Proposed, and what changes
were incorporated. A Proposal must be a "reasonably plausible
evolution" of its proto-Proposal or this credit does not apply. In

PROPOSAL 867 (KoJen)

Conflicting Proposals
(creates a rule)

If there is currently a distributed Proposal X, or a submitted but
not-yet-distributed Proposal-to-be X, whose effect includes the
amending or repeal of Rule Y, then no additional Proposals whose
effect includes the amending or repeal of the same Rule Y shall be
accepted until the outcome of Proposal X is decided. Responsibility of
enforcing this is given to the Speaker, who shall return such
submissions to the sender, as they are not properly made proposals.

[Justification: To prevent confusion and frustration, and time-wasting
from simultaneous Proposals which conflict with one another, possibly
jeapordizing the passage of both of them. Give each Proposal a fair
chance before allowing the next to be up for vote.]

Registered Players
(Amends a Rule)

Rule 498 is Amended in its entirety to read:

"A Player is any person who is registered as a Player.  No person
may be registered as a Player more than once concurrently."

[ This makes way in the future for Rules that permit non-Players
(or even semi-Players, or different ranks) to affect the Game.
There is not much effect on the Rules now, as the Rules generally
refer to Players.  I came up with this when people kept pointing
out that Steve, etc., *might* (I disagree) be causing us to break
the Rules by listening to them.  Also, someone pointed out that
any Foreign Policy (even just trade) will require this Rule to be
amended.  Why not do it now? ]

"While On Hold, a Player may not Vote, propose Proposals,
or campaign for or hold Office.  E is also absolved of any
duties which would otherwise be required of eim, including
appointment as a Judge."

Keep Jeffrey S.!

Let Jeffrey S. be the Clerk of the Courts.

[ I don't want to see our esteemed Clerk resign under a cloud.
I think he has done quite a good job.  I, like Chuck, disagree
with the withdrawal of 826, but I do not feel this is a valid
reason to impugn anyone's honesty and integrity.

Don't get me wrong, I am not saying that Chuck would make a bad
CotC, he'd probably make quite a good one, but there is a principle
to be upheld.  Vote FOR, and keep Jeffrey S. as our CotC! ]

Semimutable Rules
(Creates a Rule)

Let there be a class of Mutable Rules known as Semimutable Rules.
Semimutable Rules may only be Amended or Repealed if a Proposal to do
so receives at least four times as many FOR Votes as AGAINST Votes.
All Semimutable Rules shall be marked as such in any copies of the
Ruleset mandated by the Rules.

Any Immutable Rule that is Transmuted to Mutable shall automatically
be Semimutable.

Rules may be made Semimutable (or non-Semimutable) by Proposal.
Removing Semimutability in this way requires at least four times as
many FOR Votes as AGAINST Votes. 

This Rule is Semimutable.  Upon being Adopted, this Rule's Number
shall be changed to 200.  Upon being Amended, this Rule's Number
shall likewise be changed to 200.

This Rule takes precedence over all other Rules governing the number
of Votes needed to Adopt Proposals.

Withdrawing Proposals
(Creates a Rule)

If a Player informs the Speaker at least one day before the end of
the Voting Period that e wishes to Withdraw a Proposal that was
submitted by eim, no further Votes on that Proposal shall be 
accepted.  All existing Votes on that Proposal shall be changed to
ABSTAIN, and shall not count as Votes for purposes other than 
determining whether the Proposal in question passed.

Upon Withdrawing the Proposal, the Player shall lose three Points,
or five Points if the Proposal had not previously been discussed
in the Public Forum before being submitted.  These Points shall be
given to the Speaker, unless the Speaker is making the Withdrawal,
in which case they shall be placed in the Point Reserve.  Further,
the Player shall compensate any other Players who placed Points in
the Vototron for that Proposal.

This Rule takes precedence over other Rules governing Votes and

Group Proposals
(Creates a Rule)

A Group as a whole may make Proposals.  Such Proposals are submitted
by the Group's Vizier, and are treated precisely as Proposals submitted
by Players, except that they do not count toward any Proposal limits or
quotas.

At most one such Group Proposal per Group may be submitted per Nomic
Week;  Group Proposals shall only be made as explicitly permitted in
the Group Ordinances.  A Group shall automatically cast its Votes FOR
its own Group Proposals.

After the Voting Period, a Group that submitted a Group Proposal shall
receive 2 * (F-A) Points from the Point Reserve, where F is the number
of Votes cast FOR the Group Proposal, and A is the number of Votes cast
AGAINST it; unless F-A is negative, in which case it shall lose 2 * (A-F)
Points to the Point Reserve.  The Points shall be placed in (or removed
from, as the case may be) the Group's Treasury.

This Rule takes precedence over any Rule defining a Proposal limit or
quota.

[ Gives Groups a chance to officially define themselves.  State their
platforms in actions, so to speak.  And a Group that can charm other
Groups into going along is rewarded, just as Players are.  Plus, there
are other uses for Group Proposals.  Read on! ]

Proposal 876 (Garth)

Group War
(Creates a Rule)

A Group (known as the Aggressor) may Declare War upon another Group
(known as the Victim).  The Aggressor may make such a Declaration
only as explicitly permitted in its Ordinances.  A Declaration of
War is announced by the Aggressor's Vizier to the Public Forum,
with an account as well of the Reasons for the Declaration.

While at War, all Points won or lost by the Aggressor for its Group
Proposals shall be transferred from (or to, as the case may be) the
Victim's Treasury rather than the Point Reserve.  Further, the
Aggressor shall receive one Point from the Victim's Treasury for
each Proposal of its Members that is Adopted.

A War ends if there are zero Points or less left in either the
Aggressor or the Victim's Treasuries, or as provided in other Rules.
If the Aggressor's Treasury is depleted, the Victim has Won, and
each Member of the Aggressor must make a Formal Apology (as defined
in other Rules), using the Prescribed Words chosen by the Victim's
Vizier.  If the Victim's Treasury is depleted, the Aggressor has
Won, and the Victim shall lose one of its Votes for two Nomic Weeks,
while the Aggressor shall gain an extra Vote for two Nomic Weeks.

After a War is Won, the losing side may not have War Declared on it
for two Nomic Weeks, unless it forfeits that protection by Declaring
War itself.

This Rule takes precedence over other Rules governing Group Proposals
and Group Votes.

[ If you think this is totally silly and frivolous, you're ALMOST right.
Note that the way to win a War is to make good Proposals.  Well, anyway,
Proposals that pass.  So it encourages good play, as well as being a
great deal of fun!  The ban on War for two weeks after a loss is intended
to prevent a Group from being wiped out.  Note:  I created this after 
someone complained that there wasn't enough interaction between Groups.
You have only yourselves to blame!  :) ]

Proposal 877 (Garth)

Ending a War by Mutual Agreement
(Creates a Rule)

A War may be ended prematurely if the two sides agree to an
Armistice.  An Armistice is a binding agreement between the two
Groups, containing whatever terms they agree upon.  Armistices
must be published to the Public Forum and confirmed by the Viziers
of the two Groups in order to be binding.  Armistices may only be
negotiated, agreed upon, and confirmed as stipulated in the Groups'
Ordinances.  If the Ordinances are silent on this matter, no 
Armistice may be concluded.  Violation of an Armistice shall be a
Class C Crime, and shall further be a violation of this Rule.

No Armistice may require any Player or Nomic Entity to violate the
Rules or commit Crimes.  Any Armistice purporting to require such
shall be null and void.

If both of the two Groups have Declared War on each other, only a
single Armistice is needed to end both Wars.

[ This gives another way out of a War besides fighting to the bitter
end.  It encourages diplomacy, sneaky wording, sliminess and back-
stabbing.  In other words, the stuff that Nomic is all about! :) ]

Duane,

   You are correct and I had made those calculations, though in checking my

to add them to your account.  That error has been corrected.  Your account
record is as follows:
-------- Duane Watts <duanew@atlas.com>

11/02/93    + 6     =   9       conversion Points to Marks

11/24       + 1     =   1       purchase from Bank
11/25       + 1.344 =   2.344   Game end Points to Marks
01/11/94    + 3.5   =   5.844   Compensation of destruction of Wes Stock
01/31/94    + 1     =           Game end Points to Marks
02/01       - 4.2   =   2.644   initial purchase Garth Stock.
03/14       + 0.37  =   3.01    Game end Points to Marks
03/14       + 2.1   =   5.11    Compensation for Garth stock
03/24       + 0.02  =   5.13    Game end Points to Marks
04/04       - 0.3   =   3.83    purchase Duane stock

Note that the Game end Points to Marks may need to move to the deferred list.

Proto Proposal Ian-4-A
Foreign Policy Directives Defined
(Amends a Rule)

The last paragraph of Rule 861 shall be amended to read as follows:

   Non-Rule-Change Proposals may be submitted directing the Ambassador on
how to conduct a single piece of Foreign Policy business.  These proposals
are automatically Sane and must be submitted with the following legal
Declaration:
   (Foreign Policy Directive)

   A proposal of this type, herein called an FPD, is not to be kept with
the Ruleset. Instead, the Ambassador is responsible for keeping a list of
FPDs and making them available to anyone who asks for them.  FPDs may be
repealed by a Non-Rule-Change proposal with the following Declaration:
   (Repeals an FPD)

   The Ambassador is required to conduct Foreign Policy as e sees fit, as
long as e does not act contrary to any FPDs.  If the ambassador acts
contrary to an FPD, e may be charged with a Class C Crime.

Protoproposal xxx

Precedence of FPDs

(creates a rule)

Newer foreign policy directives take precedence over older ones.

Only when a foreign policy directive has been explicitly completely
superceded may it be dropped from the records, however.

************

David Nicol

That okay with everyone?  Does "explicitly completely" need to be
expanded and spelled out any?  The idea is that FPDs will have clauses in
them like "this FPD completely supercedes FPDs 953, 1044 and 1327" after
which those three fpds need no longer clutter the ambassadors official
portfolio and they may be safely shredded w/o fear of valid case being
brought.

    Proposal 871 (Garth)

    Keep Jeffrey S.!
    (Run for Office)

    Let Jeffrey S. be the Clerk of the Courts.

    [ I don't want to see our esteemed Clerk resign under a cloud.
    I think he has done quite a good job.  I, like Chuck, disagree
    with the withdrawal of 826, but I do not feel this is a valid
    reason to impugn anyone's honesty and integrity.

    Don't get me wrong, I am not saying that Chuck would make a bad
    CotC, he'd probably make quite a good one, but there is a principle
    to be upheld.  Vote FOR, and keep Jeffrey S. as our CotC! ]

Subject: OFF: Voting Results, revised
Status: OR


Here are the revised Voting results.  There is an apparent
irregularity I am unsure how to handle.  Group PROSIRUP Voted
successfully to cast its Votes on several Proposals, but there is
no record of the PROSIRUP Vizier (Oerjan, at the time) having so
informed the Speaker.  Care to comment, Oerjan, Jeffrey?  It could
make a difference on some Proposals.  These results assume that
PROSIRUP did not Vote.

Also, the legality of Proposals 876 and 877 is unclear to me; Ian
has pointed out that they exceeded the allotted limit of seven per
Player.  It would appear that they were not submitted "in the proper
way," but it would depend on if they were submitted in the same
Week as the others.  I include the Votes on them for completeness.

Finally, will whoever submitted Proposal 864 please speak up?

                  Speaker Garth

PROPOSAL 865 (KoJen)

Incentive For Proto-Proposing
(creates a rule)

Players are urged to "proto-Propose" an idea before submitting it as
an official Proposal. This is done be posting the complete Proposal as
it would be submitted, to the Public Forum, adding the prefix "proto-"
to the word "PROPOSAL", at least one Week and no more than four Weeks
before the Proposal is submitted to the Speaker. The submitter is
encouraged but not required to take into account suggestions by the
Nomic community, and modify the proto-proposal before submitting as an
official Proposal. When proposed in this manner, the Proposer receives
2 Points. The Speaker must mention this payment when e distributes the
Proposal. 

To be eligible for this, the submitter must indicate to the Speaker
when the Proposal was proto-Proposed, and what changes were
incorporated. A Proposal must be a "reasonably plausible evolution" of
its proto-Proposal or this credit does not apply. In case of a
violation, the submitter, and not the Speaker shall be the Guilty
Party.

[Justification: This should improve the quality of Proposals somewhat
by encouraging discussion.]

Players are urged to "proto-Propose" an idea before submitting it as

proto-Propose it to eir own Group rather than to the Public
Forum. This is done by Posting the complete Proposal as it would be
submitted, to all Active members of eir Group, adding the prefix
"proto-" to the word "PROPOSAL", at least one Week and no more then
four Weeks before the Proposal is submitted to the Speaker. The
submitter is encouraged but not required to take into account
suggestions by the Group members, and modify the proto-proposal before
submitting as an official Proposal. When proposed in this manner, the
Proposer receives 2 Points. The Speaker must mention this payment when
e distributes the Proposal.

To be eligible for this, the submitter must indicate to the Speaker
when and to whom the Proposal was proto-Proposed, and what changes
were incorporated. A Proposal must be a "reasonably plausible
evolution" of its proto-Proposal or this credit does not apply. In

PROPOSAL 867 (KoJen)

Conflicting Proposals
(creates a rule)

If there is currently a distributed Proposal X, or a submitted but
not-yet-distributed Proposal-to-be X, whose effect includes the
amending or repeal of Rule Y, then no additional Proposals whose
effect includes the amending or repeal of the same Rule Y shall be
accepted until the outcome of Proposal X is decided. Responsibility of
enforcing this is given to the Speaker, who shall return such
submissions to the sender, as they are not properly made proposals.

[Justification: To prevent confusion and frustration, and time-wasting
from simultaneous Proposals which conflict with one another, possibly
jeapordizing the passage of both of them. Give each Proposal a fair
chance before allowing the next to be up for vote.]

Registered Players
(Amends a Rule)

Rule 498 is Amended in its entirety to read:

"A Player is any person who is registered as a Player.  No person
may be registered as a Player more than once concurrently."

[ This makes way in the future for Rules that permit non-Players
(or even semi-Players, or different ranks) to affect the Game.
There is not much effect on the Rules now, as the Rules generally
refer to Players.  I came up with this when people kept pointing
out that Steve, etc., *might* (I disagree) be causing us to break
the Rules by listening to them.  Also, someone pointed out that
any Foreign Policy (even just trade) will require this Rule to be
amended.  Why not do it now? ]

Semimutable Rules
(Creates a Rule)

Let there be a class of Mutable Rules known as Semimutable Rules.
Semimutable Rules may only be Amended or Repealed if a Proposal to do
so receives at least four times as many FOR Votes as AGAINST Votes.
All Semimutable Rules shall be marked as such in any copies of the
Ruleset mandated by the Rules.

Any Immutable Rule that is Transmuted to Mutable shall automatically
be Semimutable.

Rules may be made Semimutable (or non-Semimutable) by Proposal.
Removing Semimutability in this way requires at least four times as
many FOR Votes as AGAINST Votes. 

This Rule is Semimutable.  Upon being Adopted, this Rule's Number
shall be changed to 200.  Upon being Amended, this Rule's Number
shall likewise be changed to 200.

This Rule takes precedence over all other Rules governing the number

Withdrawing Proposals

submitted by eim, no further Votes on that Proposal shall be 
accepted.  All existing Votes on that Proposal shall be changed to
ABSTAIN, and shall not count as Votes for purposes other than 
determining whether the Proposal in question passed.

Upon Withdrawing the Proposal, the Player shall lose three Points,
or five Points if the Proposal had not previously been discussed
in the Public Forum before being submitted.  These Points shall be
given to the Speaker, unless the Speaker is making the Withdrawal,
in which case they shall be placed in the Point Reserve.  Further,
the Player shall compensate any other Players who placed Points in
the Vototron for that Proposal.

Group Proposals
(Creates a Rule)

A Group as a whole may make Proposals.  Such Proposals are submitted
by the Group's Vizier, and are treated precisely as Proposals submitted
by Players, except that they do not count toward any Proposal limits or
quotas.

At most one such Group Proposal per Group may be submitted per Nomic
Week;  Group Proposals shall only be made as explicitly permitted in
the Group Ordinances.  A Group shall automatically cast its Votes FOR
its own Group Proposals.

After the Voting Period, a Group that submitted a Group Proposal shall
receive 2 * (F-A) Points from the Point Reserve, where F is the number
of Votes cast FOR the Group Proposal, and A is the number of Votes cast
AGAINST it; unless F-A is negative, in which case it shall lose 2 * (A-F)
Points to the Point Reserve.  The Points shall be placed in (or removed
from, as the case may be) the Group's Treasury.

This Rule takes precedence over any Rule defining a Proposal limit or
quota.

[ Gives Groups a chance to officially define themselves.  State their
platforms in actions, so to speak.  And a Group that can charm other
Groups into going along is rewarded, just as Players are.  Plus, there
are other uses for Group Proposals.  Read on! ]

Proposal 876 (Garth)

Group War
(Creates a Rule)

A Group (known as the Aggressor) may Declare War upon another Group
(known as the Victim).  The Aggressor may make such a Declaration
only as explicitly permitted in its Ordinances.  A Declaration of
War is announced by the Aggressor's Vizier to the Public Forum,
with an account as well of the Reasons for the Declaration.

While at War, all Points won or lost by the Aggressor for its Group
Proposals shall be transferred from (or to, as the case may be) the
Victim's Treasury rather than the Point Reserve.  Further, the
Aggressor shall receive one Point from the Victim's Treasury for
each Proposal of its Members that is Adopted.

A War ends if there are zero Points or less left in either the
Aggressor or the Victim's Treasuries, or as provided in other Rules.
If the Aggressor's Treasury is depleted, the Victim has Won, and
each Member of the Aggressor must make a Formal Apology (as defined
in other Rules), using the Prescribed Words chosen by the Victim's
Vizier.  If the Victim's Treasury is depleted, the Aggressor has
Won, and the Victim shall lose one of its Votes for two Nomic Weeks,
while the Aggressor shall gain an extra Vote for two Nomic Weeks.

After a War is Won, the losing side may not have War Declared on it
for two Nomic Weeks, unless it forfeits that protection by Declaring
War itself.

This Rule takes precedence over other Rules governing Group Proposals
and Group Votes.

[ If you think this is totally silly and frivolous, you're ALMOST right.
Note that the way to win a War is to make good Proposals.  Well, anyway,
Proposals that pass.  So it encourages good play, as well as being a
great deal of fun!  The ban on War for two weeks after a loss is intended
to prevent a Group from being wiped out.  Note:  I created this after 
someone complained that there wasn't enough interaction between Groups.
You have only yourselves to blame!  :) ]

Proposal 877 (Garth)

Ending a War by Mutual Agreement
(Creates a Rule)

A War may be ended prematurely if the two sides agree to an
Armistice.  An Armistice is a binding agreement between the two
Groups, containing whatever terms they agree upon.  Armistices
must be published to the Public Forum and confirmed by the Viziers
of the two Groups in order to be binding.  Armistices may only be
negotiated, agreed upon, and confirmed as stipulated in the Groups'
Ordinances.  If the Ordinances are silent on this matter, no 
Armistice may be concluded.  Violation of an Armistice shall be a
Class C Crime, and shall further be a violation of this Rule.

No Armistice may require any Player or Nomic Entity to violate the
Rules or commit Crimes.  Any Armistice purporting to require such
shall be null and void.

If both of the two Groups have Declared War on each other, only a
single Armistice is needed to end both Wars.

[ This gives another way out of a War besides fighting to the bitter
end.  It encourages diplomacy, sneaky wording, sliminess and back-
stabbing.  In other words, the stuff that Nomic is all about! :) ]

Status: OR


Here are the Proposals that have been submitted.  The Proposal
Queue is open.

                 Speaker Garth

==================

Proposal 878 (Ian)

Legal Votes
(Amends a Rule)

     The first sentence of Rule #683, which currently reads
"Voters may cast of a Vote of FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN for any
Proposal within its prescribed Voting Period." is to be replaced
by the sentence "No rule may prevent a Voter from casting of a
Vote of FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN on any valid Proposal within its
prescribed Voting Period."
     The following two paragraphs are to be amended to the Rule:
     Furthurmore, no Rule may change a Voter's Vote at any time.
     This Rule takes precedence over all Rules that specify legal
Votes.

[Note that this means that players on hold can vote and that anyone
can vote on a withdrawn proposal - though I don't think they have
been defined yet.]

[The Speaker does not oppose this Proposal, but only because e can
find no legal justification for doing so.  Why should Players On Hold
be able to Vote??]

====================

Proposal 879 (Garth)

Quorum
(Amends a Rule)

Rule 201 is Amended in its entirety to read:

"Quorum for a Proposal is defined as 35% of all Players, or 50% of
all Voters not On Hold, whichever is greater.

Any determination of whether a Proposal has made Quorum shall use
the number of Players or Voters at the beginning of the prescribed
Voting Period for that Proposal."

[ Makes Quorum more representative.  Currently, *three* Voters can
pass legislation.  This is too small.  Further, it should give us
an automatic "holiday break" as people have proposed, provided 
enough people take a holiday off.  For those interested, with our
current situation, Quorum would be six Votes by either method. ]

[Modesty forbids that the Speaker comment.]

====================

Proposal 880 (Garth)

No Vacations for Officers
(Amends a Rule)

The last sentence of Rule 405 is hereby removed.

[ This gets rid of the precedence clause of 405, which refers to a nonexistent
Rule.  No need for it to stick around, and no need for a replacement, as 405
doesn't need precedence over 733 (386's replacement). ]

[Ditto.]

====================

Proposal 881 (Garth)

Default Rules for Officers
(Amends a Rule)

Rule 733 is Amended in the following ways:

The last line is removed.

The word "Official" is replaced by "Officer".

The third sentence is amended to read:  "An Officer may be replaced by
another Player if a Proposal to that effect passes."

[ This gets rid of the extraneous line in 733, which bugs the heck out of me
every time I see it!  Now I can sleep at night!  :)  And while I was at it,
I decided to clean up the wording a bit. ]

[Ditto ditto.]

==================

Proposal 882 (Alice)

Proposals Phrased As Limericks Are Rewarded
(Creates a Rule)
 
--
 In the cardinal interests of rhyme,
 A Voter recieves for each time,
   Eis Proposal is phrased
   That is limerick based,
 Ten whole points to eis score line!
-- 
 Now a limerick has five lines, you see,
 and line four rhymes with line three.
   Lines one, five and two
   Also do rhyme, it is true.
 Now make your rules limericks, I plea.
 --

[Speaker's Note:

'Tis true that the Rules are too prosy,
A little verse makes life more rosy!
	So let the Set rhyme,
	And so, at this time,
The Speaker, e does not oppose-y! ]

=====================

Proposal 883 (Stella?)

Close a hole in a Policy Directive
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 861 by adding:

To qualify for the reward, at least half the Players of such a
Game should not play already in *this* Nomic Game.

[ Speaker's note:  It's still pretty easy to get around this. ]

=====================

Proposal 884 (Ian)

Declaring Proposals
(Amends a Rule)

Upon the passage of this rule, Rule #454 shall be amended
in the following way:

The following text will be inserted after sentence three of
the first paragraph: "A Player who submits a proposal which
does not include a Declaration, as described here and in
other legislation, shall be guilty of a Class C Crime. Any
Player who submits a proposal which includes a Declaration
that has not been approved by legislation shall be guilty
of a Class A Crime."

[This would combine #454 and #455, making the ruleset easier
to read and more consistent.]

[ Why not? ]

=================

Proposal 885 (Ian)

Repeals unnecessary Rule
(Repeals a Rule)

The previous Rule submitted by the Player who submitted this rule
which amended Rule #454, is, for the purposes of this Rule only,
referred to by the name Fred. If Fred has been adopted, then upon
the passage of this rule, Rule #455 shall be Repealed. If Fred was
not adopted, then this rule, if adopted, shall be considered null
and void and shall be removed from the Rule Set.

[#455 becomes unnecessary if my previous Rule is adopted.]

[ A bit wordy, but again, why not?  :) ]

===================

Proposal 886 (Vlad)
(Creates a Rule)

Test to see if Players take the Rules too Seriously

Within 24 hours of the passage of this proposal,
all Players must kill themselves.

[ Speaker's Note:  Since I have to be alive to perform my duties
as Speaker, I hereby Oppose this Proposal.  It is Contested. ]

======================

Proposal 887 (Garth)

Get Rid Of 861!
(Appeal by Proposal)

CFJ 124, which ruled that Proposal 861 had legal force, is hereby 
Overturned.

[ 861 purported to be a FPD, yet it strays badly into Rule territory.
It does not fulfil the definition of a FPD. ]

======================

Proposal 888 (Garth)

FPDs Are Not Rules
(Appeal by Proposal)

CFJ 125, which ruled that Proposal 861 (a FPD) was a Rule, is hereby
Overturned.

[ Since a FPD does not Create, Amend, Repeal, or Transmute a Rule, it
*must* be a NRC Proposal.  861 should not be in the Ruleset. ]

=======================

Proposal 889 (Garth)

The Clerk of the Courts, Part I, Take 2
(Amends a Rule)

The last sentence of the first paragraph of Rule 406 is hereby
removed.

[ This will permit the CotC to be selected as Judge.  I don't see
why we can't trust em, when we trust the Speaker to count Votes on
eir own Proposals. ]

========================

Proposal 890 (Garth)

Selecting a Judge
(Amends a Rule)

Rule 793 is Amended in the following ways:

All instances of the word Voter are changed to the word Player.

All instances of the word Voters are changed to the word Players.

[ This will permit the Speaker to be selected as Judge.  Why shouldn't
e be? ]

With regard to Stella's CFJ, which was judged true (by me), and which requires
scores to be adjusted from 2 games prior to the present game, and which will
result in a whole slew of cascaded changes to the game state, and which will be
essentially impossible to achieve, what should we do? which one of the
following? or something else entirely?

1) we all pledge to ignore the entire thing.

2) scorekeepor shall disobey the injunction ordering him to change the scores,
and we all pledge not to CFJ the scorekeepor.

3) scorekeepor shall disobey the injunction, and either the scorekeepor himself
shall CFJ the scorekeepor for failing to obey the injunction.

4) we all take 6 months or so repairing the incorrect game state. Then, when
all is fixed to everyone's satisfaction, we continue, hoping we didn't do
something wrong and have to take another 6 months to repair it again.

5) scorekeepor goes on strike.

6) scorekeepor resigns and appoints some other poor slob to do this task.
Stella comes to mind for getting us into this mess :-)

7) something else. Pleas specify.


I want an opinion from as many players as possible on how to deal with this
matter. Scorekeepor cannot continue given the current state of affairs.

Whoof.  It's a toughie.  Could you remind me of the needed changes that were

Out of the question.

Can't say I like this, either.
: 
: 3) scorekeepor shall disobey the injunction, and either the scorekeepor himself
: shall CFJ the scorekeepor for failing to obey the injunction.

A possibility, but what about *after* that happens?

Do you mean leave the game, or just not do the job?

It has a certain appeal.  :)
: 
: 7) something else. Pleas specify.

I suggest we pass a Rule (a NRC Proposal would be better, but we don't have
one yet) declaring that the game state has changed to the published state.

How's this for an NRC Proposal for this kind of thing:

---------------------
Score Changes by Decree
(Creates a Rule)

Let there be a new kind of Decree, called a Score Change, which shall change
Players' Scores to the values specified in the Decree.

The Scorekeepor shall maintain a current record of all Score Changes.

Such a Decree shall have an Adoption Ratio of unanimity, and shall be Proposed
with the following legal Declaration:
   (Score Change)
---------------------

The requirement of unanimity is rough, but necessary.  Otherwise, we could
just stop someone from winning by setting eir Score to zero or whatever.

=======================

Emergency Marks Tax
(Creates a Rule)

If at any point in time the Bank owns zero Marks, the Banker shall
transfer x percent of each Player's or Currency-owing Entity's
(but not the Bank's) Marks account to the Bank, where x shall be
chosen so that the total number of Marks collected exactly covers
all the Bank's debts plus one Mark.  The Bank's debts shall then
be paid, starting with the largest debt and moving to the smallest.

Players who lose Marks in this fashion shall be compensated with 
Points in a ratio of 25 Points to the (lost) Mark.  These Points
shall be drawn from the Point Reserve.  Entities which can own
Points, and which lose Marks in this fashion, shall be similarly
compensated.

[ This is an easy and relatively painless way to keep the economy
flowing and the Bank out of arrears. ]

Here are two more Proposals for the Voting Public, from Chuck.

                      Speaker Garth

================

Proposal 891 (Chuck)

Only 4 types of Proposed Rule Changes
(Amends a Rule)

The first paragraph of Rule 807 is amended to read:

Proposals may be made which do not contain Rule Changes.  All
proposals, except those which have one of the following
declarations:
    (Creates a Rule)
    (Amends a Rule)
    (Repeals a Rule)
    (Transmutes a Rule)
are Non-Rule-Change Proposals (or NRC Proposals).  However,
only those NRC Proposals defined in other Rules may
be proposed.

[It's nice to *know* when voting whether or not a proposal
will change the Rules, unlike in proposal 861.
I don't mind if people want to define additional kinds of
Proposed Rule Changes later (as Garth has suggested)--you'll
just have to amend this Rule to do it.]

[ The Speaker rather likes this.  However I'll have to change
my third Patch Proto to Create a Rule rather than Amend 807.
Consider it done. ]

=========

Proposal 892 (Chuck)

Injunction in CFJ 125 *is* illegal
(Appeal by Proposal)

The Judgement on CFJ 127 ("In delivering judgement on CFJ 125, David Nicol
violated Rule 663") is changed from FALSE to TRUE.

[The central issue is whether or not the Injunction delivered by Judge
Nicol was illegal.]

[ The Speaker agrees with Chuck's take on this issue. ]

The following Players receive Points for notifying me that they Proto-
Proposed the Proposals currently up for Vote.

I have noticed that 865 and 866 require me to note this "when the 
Proposals are distributed".  This is a royal pain (why can't I do
it later?) and I would appreciate it if someone (KoJen?) would
put up an Amendment.  CFJ on this if you wish...

Announcing the KoJen Philanthropic Phoundation.

Every week I will contribute a sum of Marks to a Philanthropic Phund. This
Phund will be used to Phinance awards to be given to authors of successful
legislation which, in the opinion of the trustees of this Phund, "go far in
contributing to making Agora Nomic a better place for all". 

The awards will be given out only when particularly deserving legislation is
passed. Hint: One thing I consider to be particularly deserving is major
simplifications to the Rule Set.

I will start this Phund at 0.25 Marks, and will make periodic contributions.

-- KoJen
Administrator of the KoJen Philanthropic Phoundation.

Here's a new Proto-Proposal.  What do you think?

                  Garth

=========================

Entities Are People Too!
(Creates a Rule)

Any Nomic Entity which can own Points and Currencies shall receive
Interest from its Marks and Dividends from its Stocks in exactly
the same manner as Players.

This Rule takes precedence over Rules describing Currencies.

[ Lets Groups (for example) earn Interest and Dividends.  I'd like
to make the language more general, to cover future benefits from
other Currencies, but I'm unsure of how to do it.  Suggestions? ]

Here's a revised version of my Group Proposal Proposal.

                       Garth

===========================

Group Proposals
(Creates a Rule)

A Group as a whole may make Proposals.  Such Proposals are submitted
by the Group's Vizier, and are treated precisely as Proposals submitted
by Players, except that they do not count toward any Proposal limits or
quotas.

At most one such Group Proposal per Group may be submitted per Nomic
Week;  Group Proposals shall only be made as explicitly permitted in
the Group Ordinances.

After the Voting Period, a Group that submitted a Group Proposal shall
receive 2 * (F-A) Points from the Point Reserve, where F is the number
of Votes cast FOR the Group Proposal, and A is the number of Votes cast
AGAINST it; unless F-A is negative, in which case it shall lose 2 * (A-F)
Points to the Point Reserve.  The Points shall be placed in (or removed
from, as the case may be) the Group's Treasury.

This Rule takes precedence over any Rule defining a Proposal limit or
quota.

[ Gives Groups a chance to officially define themselves.  State their
platforms in actions, so to speak.  And a Group that can charm other
Groups into going along is rewarded, just as Players are. ]

Can Of Worms Alert, people!  Take a look at this:

Apparently, Proposal 864 was not properly Proposed.  Therefore, it should not
have been Voted upon.  I think.

It would *seem* that the Walrus Marks are still there.  Any ideas?

CFJ 132

The Judge is Dave Nicol.

CFJ: Garth  Mar 31 10:56:37
Judge: Dave Nicol  Apr 1 01:06:22


Statement:  

            Rule 823 should be interpreted to mean that Marks converted
            from Points at the end of a Game are drawn from the Bank, not
            Created.


Arguments: [Garth]

            The text of 823 clearly states this.  It's a wonder noone 
            noticed it before.

Evidence:

823.  Marks Conversions

      At the end of each game let each Player that did not win have
      eir points be converted to Marks in a ratio of 50 points to 1
      Mark.  The winner's points shall be taken away and e shall not
      receive any Mark's compensation for eis points.

      Marks for these conversions shall be awarded from the bank as
      directed by the Ruleset
      (*Was: 732*)


Decision:  [Dave Nicol]

           I judge UNDECIDED.


Rationale: [Dave Nicol]

           The reason is, the evidence does not contain
           the rules covering the aspect of rule 823 with which the
           statement is concerned.  823 passes the buck of where the
           marks are to come from, from the bank's reserve or from nowhere.

           "...shall be awarded from the bank as directed by the ruleset" is not
           enough direction in itself to make the call, are they created then
           awarded or awarded from the bank's supply.

CFJ 131

The Judge is Oerjan.

CFJ: Dave Bowen  Mar 30 10:11:55
Judge: Oerjan  Mar 30 19:40:41  Apr 5 12:43:45


Statement:

Rule 862 conflicts with Immutable Rule 105 and is thereby entirely void in
accordance with Rule 111.


Argument: [Dave Bowen]

   Rule 862, in attempting to restrict the nature of amendments that may be
made to it, conflicts with Rule 105 which allows any amendment of a mutable
rule.  Since this conflict is that of a Mutable Rule with an Immutable Rule,
Rule 111 applies and the Mutable Rule, i.e. Rule 862, shall be entirely void.

Rule 105 (Immutable)
What Is a Rule Change?

105.

      A Rule Change is any of the following:  (1) the enactment,
      repeal, or amendment of a mutable Rule; or (2) the transmutation
      of an immutable Rule into a mutable Rule or vice versa.
        (Note:  This definition implies that, at least initially, all
      new Rules are Mutable; Immutable Rules, as long as they are
      Immutable, may not be Amended or Repealed; Mutable Rules, as long
      as they are Mutable, may be Amended or Repealed; any Rule of any
      status may be Transmuted; no Rule is absolutely immune to change.)

Rule 111 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Conflicts

111.

      In a conflict between a Mutable and an Immutable Rule, the
      immutable Rule takes precedence and the Mutable Rule shall be
      entirely void.  For the purposes of this Rule a Proposal to
      Transmute an Immutable Rule does not "conflict" with that
      Immutable Rule.

Rule 862 (Mutable)
The Entrepeneur

862.  The Patent Title of Entrepreneur

      Let there exist the Patent Title of Entrepreneur.
      This Title will be awarded to the most enterprizing
      Free Enterprizer.
      The Entrepreneur will be chosen by means of an election
      organized by the Banker, by any means he sees fit.
      Candidates for the Title are Chuck, KoJen, Oerjan and Waggie.

      This Rule can only be amended by a Proposal to award the
      Patent Title of Entrepreneur to another Player.


Ruling:  [Oerjan]

     I judge FALSE.


Justification:  [Oerjan]

     There are two relevant parts of 105:

     > 105.
     > 
     >       A Rule Change is any of the following:  (1) the enactment,
     >       repeal, or amendment of a mutable Rule; or (2) the transmutation
     >       of an immutable Rule into a mutable Rule or vice versa.

     This is purely a definition of what a Rule Change is, it does not 
     allow them.

     >         (Note:  This definition implies that, at least initially, all
     >       new Rules are Mutable; Immutable Rules, as long as they are
     >       Immutable, may not be Amended or Repealed; Mutable Rules, as long
     >       as they are Mutable, may be Amended or Repealed; any Rule of any
     >       status may be Transmuted; no Rule is absolutely immune to change.)

     This note as written only describes how the main part of the Rule 
     interacts with the initial Rule Set. It does not contain any 
     restrictions, only clarification.  Therefore, it does not forbid 
     the enactment of future Rules that restricts how Rules may be Amended.

I believe that Rule 865 implies that one must request Proto-Proposal
Points upon the submission of the Proposal in question.

I have had several requests for them after the fact;  the above is my
interpretation.  I would welcome other points of view.

Here's a Proto-Proposal that would permit the Game to be suspended.

                        Garth

========================

Suspending the Game:  Limbo
(Creates a Rule)

Let there be a Game State known as Limbo.

When the Game is in Limbo, no official Nomic actions may be taken by
any Player or Entity, and all Players and Entities are absolved of
any Nomic duties they would otherwise perform.

The Game may only enter Limbo upon the passage of a special Decree,
which must explicitly specify the amount of time the Game shall be
in Limbo.

Such a Decree need not be recorded, and shall be submitted with the
following legal Declaration:
  (Enter Limbo)

This Rule takes precedence over Rules that would otherwise specify
permitted or required Nomic actions while the Game is in Limbo.

[Allows Oerjan's "Holiday Breaks" if a majority of the Players agree.]

Here's the latest version of my Appeals Proto-Proposals again.

I've brought back the "Three Office" model, as I feel it gives
more accountability.

                 Garth

P.S.  If this passes, I nominate Chuck to be Justiciar.

==========================

The Justices
(Creates a Rule)

Let there be three Players known as the Justices, and an Office 
known as the Justiciar.  The Justiciar shall not receive a weekly
salary.  The Speaker and the Clerk of the Courts are ineligible
to be Justiciar.

One Justice shall be the Speaker, one shall be the Clerk of the
Courts, and one shall be the Justiciar.

The Justices shall have the duty to Judge Statements that have
been Appealed.  They shall receive the same compensation as
Judges for each Statement so Judged.

The Speaker and Clerk may delegate their duties as Justices to
other willing Players if they desire.  They must do so if a
Player would otherwise hold more than one position of Justice.

Any Justice must so delegate eir duties for a particular case
if e made the original CFJ, if e was the Judge of the original
CFJ, if e is being Accused of breaking a Rule or committing a
Crime.

If no Player is willing to receive the duties of Justice for a
case, the Clerk of the Courts shall select one randomly.

==========================

Appealing Judgement
(Amends a Rule)

Rule 690 is Amended in its entirety to read:

A Judgement may be Appealed upon the insistence of any three Players to
the Public Forum.

If a Judgement is successfully Appealed, the Justices shall each Judge
the Statement as if they were Judges.  They may confer with each other
on the case before delivering Judgement if they desire.  If a Justice
should fail to return Judgement in the allotted time, e shall be fined
three Points for each day by which e missed the deadline.  This fine
shall be levied by the Scorekeepor.

If a majority of the Justices' Judgements agree, the Statement shall be
considered to have been Judged accordingly.  Otherwise, it shall be
considered to have been ruled UNDECIDED.  The Justices' reasoning
and arguments shall be recorded with the original CFJ.

Once a Judgement has been made, the Justices may make Injunctions just
as may Judges, provided a majority of them agree.

The decision of the Justices is final; no further Appeal of that
Statement may be made.

If the decision of the original Judge of the Statement is changed by
the Justices, the Judge shall return the compensation e received to the
Point Reserve.

======================

Get Rid of Appeal By Proposal
(Amends a Rule)

The sentence of Rule 799 that begins with the phrase (Appeal by Proposal)
is hereby removed.

Encouraged by the proto-Proposal Rule I submit the following P-P's:
Rule 404 permits me to submit these Proposals all at once, which
I will do, when I am back from holidays.
I am looking forward to the 165*2 Points that I will get a week
before I get nuked by all those negative F-A's!

THE CURRENT RULESET
Part 1 of 5 

Rules are listed as follows, where NNN represents the Rule number:

========================================

Rule NNN (Immutable or Mutable)
My Own Unofficial Title

NNN.  Semi-Official Rule Title, If There Is One

      Text of Rule

Annotation: Some Rules are annotated as required by Rule 789.
These annotations "shall guide the interpretation
of that Rule."
Relevant Rules: Such annotations include a list of relevant Rules.

[Note: Some Rules are annotated by me to clarify their interpretation.
Unlike the official annotations, these are enclosed in brackets.
These annotations have no legal force in and of themselves.]

========================================



========================================

Rule 101 (Immutable)
Obey the Rules

101.

      All Players must always abide by all the Rules then in effect,
      in the form in which they are then in effect.  The Rules in the
      Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the first game.
      The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (Immutable) and
      201-219 (Mutable).

========================================

Rule 102 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Rules

102.

      Initially Rules in the 100's are Immutable and Rules in the
      200's are Mutable.  Rules subsequently Enacted or Transmuted
      (that is, changed from Immutable to Mutable or vice versa) may
      be Immutable or Mutable regardless of their Numbers, and Rules
      in the Initial Set may be Transmuted regardless of their Numbers.

========================================

Rule 103 (Immutable)
The Speaker and Voters

103.

      At any time, each Player shall be either a Voter or the Speaker;
      no Player may simultaneously be a Voter and a Speaker. At any
      time, there shall be exactly one Speaker. The term "Player" in
      the Rules shall specifically include both the Voters and the
      Speaker.

========================================

Rule 104 (Immutable)
First Speaker

104.

      The Speaker for the first game shall be Michael Norrish.

========================================

Rule 105 (Immutable)
What Is a Rule Change?

105.

      A Rule Change is any of the following:  (1) the enactment,
      repeal, or amendment of a mutable Rule; or (2) the transmutation
      of an immutable Rule into a mutable Rule or vice versa.
        (Note:  This definition implies that, at least initially, all
      new Rules are Mutable; Immutable Rules, as long as they are
      Immutable, may not be Amended or Repealed; Mutable Rules, as long
      as they are Mutable, may be Amended or Repealed; any Rule of any
      status may be Transmuted; no Rule is absolutely immune to change.)

========================================

Rule 106 (Immutable)
Adopting Proposed Rule Changes

106.

      All Rule Changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on.
      They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required
      number of votes and Quorum is achieved.

========================================

Rule 107 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Must Be Written Down

107.

      Any proposed Rule Change must be written down (or otherwise
      communicated in print media) before it is voted on. If adopted,
      it must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.

========================================

Rule 108 (Immutable)
When May Rule Changes Take Effect?

108.

      No Rule Change may take effect earlier than the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording
      explicitly states otherwise.  No rule change may have retroactive
      application.

========================================

Rule 109 (Immutable)
Rule Numbers

109.

      The Speaker shall give each proposed Rule Change a Number for
      reference.  The numbers shall begin with 301, and each Rule
      Change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next
      successive integer, whether or not the Proposal is adopted.
        If a Rule is Repealed and Reenacted, it receives the Number of
      the Proposal to Reenact it.  If a Rule is Amended or Transmuted,
      it receives the Number of the Proposal to Amend or Transmute it.
 
========================================

Rule 110 (Immutable)
Transmutation of Rules

110.

      Rule Changes that Transmute Immutable Rules into Mutable Rules
      may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among Votes
      legally cast.  Transmutation shall not be implied, but must be
      stated explicitly in a Proposal to take effect.
 
========================================

Rule 111 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Conflicts

111.

      In a conflict between a Mutable and an Immutable Rule, the
      immutable Rule takes precedence and the Mutable Rule shall be
      entirely void.  For the purposes of this Rule a Proposal to
      Transmute an Immutable Rule does not "conflict" with that
      Immutable Rule.
 
========================================

Rule 112 (Immutable)
Winning Must Be by Points

112.

      The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered
      from achieving n points to any other state of affairs.  The
      magnitude of n and the means of earning points may be changed,
      and Rules that establish a Winner when play cannot continue may
      be Enacted and (while they are mutable) be Amended or Repealed.
 
========================================

Rule 113 (Immutable)
Players May Always Forfeit

113.

      A Player always has the option to forfeit the Game rather than
      continue to play or incur a Game penalty.  No penalty worse than
      losing, in the judgment of the Player to incur it, may be
      imposed.

========================================

Rule 114 (Immutable)
At Least One Mutable Rule

114.

      There must always be at least one Mutable Rule.  The adoption of
      Rule Changes must never become completely inpermissible.

========================================

Rule 115 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Which Change Rule-Changing Rules Allowed

115.

      Rule Changes that affect Rules needed to allow or apply
      Rule Changes are as permissible as other Rule Changes.  Even
      Rule Changes that amend or repeal their own authority are
      permissible.  No Rule Change or type of move is impermissible
      solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a
      Rule.

========================================

Rule 116 (Immutable)
Permissibility of the Unprohibited

116.

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
      and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
      which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly or
      implicitly permits it.

========================================

Rule 201 (Mutable)
Quorum

201.

      Quorum for a proposed Rule Change is defined to be 20% of Voters

Rule 208 (Mutable)
End of the Voting Period

208.

      At the end of the prescribed Voting Period on a Proposal, the
      Speaker shall reveal all Votes legally cast on that Proposal. If
      the Speaker's consent may be required for a Proposal to be
      adopted then the Speaker should indicate at that time whether or
      not e gives eir consent.  If the Speaker does not explicitly
      indicate that e refuses to consent to the Proposal, it shall be
      assumed that e consents.

========================================

Rule 212 (Mutable)
Resolving Rule Conflicts

212.

      If two or more Mutable Rules conflict with one another, or if
      two or more Immutable Rules conflict with one another, then the
      Rule with the lowest ordinal Number takes precedence.
        If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of rule) or takes
      precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.
        If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

========================================

Rule 217 (Mutable)
Judgements Must Accord with the Rules

217.

      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however, if
      the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the Statement
      to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider Game Custom and the
      Spirit of the Game before applying other standards.

========================================

Rule 312 (Mutable)
A Point for Voting

312.

      If a Voter votes, he gets one (1) point at the end of the Voting
      Period.

When Does a Rule Change Take Effect?

376.  Time that a rule change takes effect:

      An adopted rule change takes full effect at the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it.
      The moment of the completion of the vote is defined by the date
      and time given in the line starting with "Date:" of the Nomic
      listserver message send by the Benevolent Speaker, announcing
      the result of the vote on the corresponding proposal.

========================================

Rule 388 (Mutable)
Game Status When a New Game Begins

388.  Starting a new Game:

      Whenever a new game of Nomic is begun, the status of the new
      Game when it begins shall be the same as the status of the old
      Game when it ended, in all respects where the Rules do not
      decide otherwise.

========================================

Rule 399 (Mutable)
The Office of the Rulekeepor

399.  The Office of the Rulekeepor:

      Let there be an Officer known as the Rulekeepor.
      The Rulekeepor shall maintain a complete list of the current

      So long as the Rulekeepor is in Office, the Speaker is not
      required to maintain or distribute the Rules.

========================================

Rule 402 (Mutable)
Transfer of Power of the Mighty Speaker

402.  Transfer of Power of the Mighty Speaker:

      When one Mighty Speaker is yielding his Office to another, the
      following procedure shall be followed:
      
       1) The Present Mighty Speaker shall forward copies of all
          necessary materials for the performance of his Office to the
          Prospective Mighty Speaker.
       2) The Prospective Mighty Speaker shall acknowledge the receipt
          of said materials.
       3) The Present Mighty Speaker shall post a message to the
          listserv announcing the official transfer of power, which
          occurs at the "Date:" of the Present Mighty Speaker's
          posting.
      
      The Present Mighty Speaker remains in Office until the successful
      completion of step 3.

========================================

Rule 404 (Mutable)
Legality of Proposals

404.  Legality of Proposals:

      As long as a Proposal satisfies all requirements in place at the
      time of its making for the proper making of Proposals, the act
      of making such a Proposal is legal regardless of its content.
      It is legal to propose a Rule which conflicts with other Rules
      or with itself, which is paradoxical, or which cannot be
      applied.

========================================

Rule 405 (Mutable)
No Vacations for Officers

405.  No Vacations for Officers:

      No Officer may be 'On Hold' while holding an Office.  If a
      current Officer should place himself On Hold, he is assumed to
      have resigned without appointing a successor, and the Office
      should be re-filled in the normal manner.  This Rule takes
      precedence over Rule 386.

========================================

Rule 406 (Mutable)
Clerk of the Courts

406.  Clerk of the Courts, Part I: Definition of Office:

      There shall exist an Office "Clerk of the Courts", who shall
      have general responsibility over administering Calls for
      Judgement, as outlined in the Rules.  The active Clerk of the
      Court may never be selected as a Judge.

      As a salary for carrying out his duties, he will receive 5
      points at the end of every seven days he is in Office, counting
      from his assumption of the Office.

      The initial holder of this Office shall be the Player who
      submitted this Proposal.

========================================

Rule 407 (Mutable)
Invoking Judgement

407.  Clerk of the Courts, Part II: Invoking Judgement:

      If Players disagree about the legality of a Move or the
      interpretation or application of a Rule, then a Player may
      invoke Judgement by submitting a Statement for Judgement to the
      Clerk of the Courts.  Disagreement, for the purposes of this
      Rule, may be created by the insistence of any Player.  When
      Judgement is invoked, the Clerk of the Courts must, as soon as
      possible, select a Judge as described in the Rules.  The Clerk
      of the Courts must then distribute the Statement to be judged,
      along with the identity of the Judge, to all Players.

========================================

      be judged and the identity of the Judge, the Judge has one week
      in which to deliver a legal Judgement.  If the Judge fails to
      deliver a Judgement within this time, e is penalized 10 points
      and a new Judge is selected.  A Judgement is delivered by
      submitting that Judgement to the Clerk of the Courts, who must
      then distribute that Judgement to all Players as soon as
      possible.

========================================

Rule 413 (Mutable)
Winning by Paradox

413.  Winning By Paradox:

      If the Rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or
      if the legality of some action cannot be determined with
      finality, or if some action appears equally legal and illegal,
      then a player may Call For Judgement on a Statement to that
      effect.  If the Statement is judged TRUE, then the same Judge
      who judged the Statement TRUE must declare the most recent
      passed Proposal X such that the Statement was not TRUE before
      the passage of Proposal X, or declare that there is no such
      Proposal.  (Until the Judge does this, the Judgment is not
      valid.)  If the Judgement of TRUE is not overruled, then the
      Player who called for Judgement is declared the Winner of the
      game.
      
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared that
      there is no such Proposal X, the game is ended, with no
      provisions for restarting it.
      
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared such
      a Proposal X, the following actions are taken:
         - all Players remain active,
         - all Proposals curently being Voted upon are removed from
           consideration for Voting,
         - the scores for all Players are set to 0 (zero),
         - the Rules and explicit game custom are reverted to the
           state they were in before Proposal X was passed,
         - a Benevolent Speaker for the next Game is chosen:
              -If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the
               Benevolent Speaker, and the old Benevolent Speaker
               becomes a Voter,
              -If there is more than one Winner, the Benevolent
               Speaker randomly selects one of the Winners, who
               becomes the new Benevolent Speaker, and the old
               Benevolent Speaker becomes a Voter,
         - and a new Game is begun.

========================================

Rule 415 (Mutable)
How To Submit a Proposal

415.  "How a Proposal is Submitted":

      A Proposal by a Voter shall be made by submitting it to the
      Mighty Speaker. As soon as possible after receiving the
      Proposal, the Mighty Speaker shall assign the Proposal a Number
      and distribute the Proposal along with its number to all
      Players.
      
      The Mighty Speaker may also make Proposals. The Mighty Speaker
      must process all pending Voter-submitted Proposals first, and
      may then Process Proposals of the Mighty Speaker, assigning
      these Proposals a number and distributing them in the same
      fashion as any other Proposal.

========================================

Rule 417 (Mutable)
The Nomic Archivist

417.  Establishment of the Office of Archivist:

      That there be established an office known as the Nomic
      Archivist, which shall be governed by the default Rules
      concerning official posts. The initial duties of the Nomic
      Archivist shall be to record the passage and failure of
      Proposals, to maintain a "historical record" (defined below)
      of the Ruleset, to maintain a list of Judgements and their case
      histories, and to maintain a list of game Winners in past games.
      The Archivist is free to comment on the historical records as
      they see fit, but such commentary must be clearly delimited
      from the historical material. Where the material being stored
      does not already admit a classification method, the Archivist
      is free to design one themselves.

      The "historical record" of the Ruleset maintained by the
      Archivist is one that includes all rules ever part of the nomic
      Ruleset, annotated with information as to their ultimate fate,
      whether Repealed or Amended etc. This record of the Ruleset has
      no legal force.

      The duties required of the Archivist may be changed with their
      consent and at the request of the Office's controlling body
      (whatsoever that may be). Initially, the controlling body of
      this Office shall be all Players, and any request to change the
      duties must therefore be supported by a majority of Players
      "speaking" to the request.  Naturally, default Rules for
      Offices may establish a different controlling body for this
      Office.
      
      The salary of the Archivist office shall be determined by its
      controlling body. Initially, its salary shall be 5 points and
      one coin of the office-holder's group per week.
      
      The initial office-holder for this post shall be Michael
      Norrish.

========================================

Rule 434 (Mutable)
Game May Be Won By CFJ

434.  Judgement Required to Win (and Timing of Win):

      If a Player believes that he has won the Game, he may submit a
      CFJ to that effect.  If it is returned with the Judgement TRUE
      (and that Judgement is not Appealed), then he has won the Game
      as of the delivery of that Judgement.  If the Judgement is TRUE,
      but is Appealed, but is sustained (and no Proposal to reverse
      the verdict is made), then he has won the Game as of the
      delivery of the Appeal verdict.  If such a verdict is sustained,
      challenged by Proposal, but the Proposal does not pass, he has
      won the Game as of the completion of the Vote on that Proposal.

      Judgement on a CFJ to win the Game may *not* be delivered until
      at least 72 hours after its official announcement, in order to
      give time for the Judge to accept input from the community.

      This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which specifies
      the exact moment at which a Game is won.

[Note: Implicit Game Custom dictates that, despite the title,
this rule does not *require* a CFJ in order to win the game.]

========================================

Rule 450 (Mutable)
Game Entities May Not Be Arbitrarily Changed

450.  Game Entities may not be Arbitrarily Changed:

      Any Entity which is created by the Nomic Rules, and which exists only
      within the context of the current Game of Nomic, such as Points,
      Votes, etc. may *not* be changed by any action other than those
      specified by the Rules.

========================================

Rule 451 (Mutable)
Determination of Judgement--Timing

451.  Timing of CFJ Results:

      When a CFJ makes a Statement about the current state of the
      Game, the result of that CFJ shall be TRUE if and only if the
      Judge feels that that Statement was correct at the time that the
      CFJ was *issued*. Any changes that have happened in the time
      between the issuing of the CFJ and its delivery must be figured
      in to find the correct current state.

========================================

Rule 452 (Mutable)
Prohibition of Electioneering by the Mighty Speaker

452.  Prohibition of Electioneering by the Mighty Speaker:

      The Speaker may not use eis knowledge of the current status of a
      vote on a Proposal in an attempt to influence the result of the
      Vote on that Proposal. Violations of this Rule shall be
      considered a Class C Crime.

========================================

Rule 454 (Mutable)
Declaring Proposals

454.  Clarity of Proposals:

      All Proposals must declare what effect that Proposal will have
      on the Rule Set. If said Proposal has a Title, this Declaration
      shall appear on the line immediately below that Title. In any
      case, the Declaration shall appear in parentheses. The
      Declarations shall be as follows:

         (Creates a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes a new
            Rule to come into existance.
         (Amends a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes an
            existing Rule to change wording or form.
         (Repeals a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes an
            existing Rule to cease to exist.
         (Transmutes a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes a
            Mutable Rule to become Immutable, or vice versa.
         (Other) shall be used if no other Declaration has been
            defined which describes the Proposal.

      Additional legislation may define additional legal Declarations
      or change the presentation of the Declaration, but this Rule
      shall take precedence in all other cases.

      Players, making eir best efforts to determine the correct
      scores. If a Player feels that the posted scores are in error,
      e may make a Call for Judgement, stating what e believes to be
      the correct scores. If the resulting Judgement is TRUE, then the
      scores shall be adjusted to the scores set forth in the Call for
      Judgement, modified further by any score changes which took
      place since the time the Call for Judgement was made. If such a

      A player may not be deregistered from the game, except by that
      player (or the Registrar, as specified elsewhere) announcing
      that he forfeits.  When a player forfeits, he remains registered
      for a length of time equal to the longest possible voting period
      on a proposal. At the end of this time, he is deregistered.
 
      During the time between forfeiting and being deregistered, the
      player may not vote or make a proposal.  The player
      automatically refuses any selection for judgement, or any other
      voluntary appointed duties.
 
      If, at any time during this period, the player announces that
      they have changed their mind about forfeiting, then these
      restrictions are instantly revoked, and the deregistration does
      not take place.

663.  General Rules For Injunctions

      There shall be an entity known as an Injunction, which may

      rules. An Injunction is a statement or series of statements
      specifying an action or actions which must take place. If a
      Judgement is is accompanied by an Injunction, that Injunction
      must be published with the Judgement. All players must abide by
      the Injunction beginning no later than 72 hours after its
      publication unless one of the following conditions then apply:
        - The Judgement which the Injunction accompanies is undergoing
          appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of the appeal
          process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but a proposal
          has been published which would overturn that decision if
          passed, and said proposal has not failed.
        - The validity of the Injunction itself is questioned by a
          pending CFJ.
        - A Judgement upholding the validity of the Injunction is
          undergoing appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of
          the appeal process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but
          a proposal has been published which would overturn that
          decision if passed, and said proposal has not failed.

      A Judgement may not be accompanied by an Injunction unless it is
      specifically permitted elsewhere in the rules. An Injunction
      must be completely consistent with all rules in effect at the
      time of issuance, and must be completely relevant to the matter
      addressed in the corresponding judgement.

      If any Player believes that an Injunction or any part of it does
      not meet the criteria for a valid Injunction, e may submit a CFJ
      to that effect. If the resulting Judgement supports the
      contention that the criteria are not met, the Injunction shall
      be considered illegal and shall have no legal force.

      This rule takes precedence over all rules governing Injunctions.

========================================

Rule 664 (Mutable)

      the Judgement an Injunction specifying that the move is to be
      retracted, and any resulting adjustments to the published game
      state. The adjustments to the game state must have been
      unambiguously specified within the CFJ, and these adjustments
      must only undo actions which were a direct or indirect result of
      that Move.

Rule 724 (Mutable)
Winning the Game

724.  Requirements for Winning

      The Winner is the first Voter to achieve sufficiently many
      Points.  The minimum number of Points required for Player X to
      win is 10*N*(1+G/6), where N is the number of Players currently
      registered in the Game, and G is the number of Games which
      Player X has already won.  If more than one Voter achieves this
      condition simultaneously, then all such Voters win.  When a Game
      ends in this manner:
        - If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the new
          Speaker and the old Speaker becomes a Voter.
        - If there is more than one Winner, the Voter with the highest Point 
          total becomes the new Speaker.  If more than one Voter is
          tied for the highest score, the old Speaker randomly selects
          one of them to become the new Speaker.  The old Speaker
          becomes a voter.
        - All Player's scores are reset to 0.
        - A new Game is begun.  All Rules and Proposals retain the
          status they had at the end of the old Game.

      On Friday Noon GMT 5% of the Points of Player X (with a minimum
      of two Points) shall be transfered to the Player (or Players)
      who holds Stock X.

      At the passing of this Proposal the Bank has possession of all
      Stocks.  During the following week the Banker shall collect the
      bids in Marks.  Those bids have to be made by the Players
      (either alone or acting together on the same Stock) in a message
      to the server.  No bid shall be made, which can not be covered
      by the Marks in  he bidders Bank account (to be verified by the
      Banker.)

      After one week each of the Stocks shall be transfered from the
      Bank to the highest bidder. If two or more bids for Stock X are
      exactly equal, the Stock shall go to player X (if one of the
      highest bidders), or to the Player with the lowest score.

      If a given Stock X is bought by Player X, the Marks of the bid
      shall be transfered from Player X to the Bank.
      If a given Stock X is bought by another Player (or Players) then
      Player X, the Marks of the bid shall go from this Player(s) to
      Player X.

      The Banker shall keep track of the Stocks held by each Player.

      shall be compensated with half the price in Marks that this
      Player paid for the Stock X.
      These Marks shall come from the account of Player X, *before*
      those shall be destroyed, as required by other Rules.
      If there are not enough Marks available, the deficit shall be
      paid by the Bank.

Rule 733 (Mutable)
Default Rules for Officers

733.  Default Rules for Officers

      An Official is any Player who has been Appointed or Elected to
      an Office specified in the Rules. A Judge is not an Officer.
      An Officer may be replaced by another Player, by a Proposal
      stating so, and that Proposal passes.
      An Officer may resign at any time, provided e appoints a
      successor.
      If an Officer resigns while a Proposal is being voted upon to
      replace eim, the Player proposed will by eis Successor.
      This Rule applies to general Offices, and therefore defers to
      Rules for specific Offices.

Rule 736 (Mutable)
The Marxist

736.  The Marxist

      Let there be the Patent Title known as "Marxist", which is
      awarded to the Player with the most Marks, or if tied, to the
      Players with the most Marks. Only the current richest Player
      or Players may hold this title.

      The determination and announcement of assignment and revoking
      of the Title is made by the Banker, who must use the most
      accurate means of determining this available to eim, and must
      make the announcement as soon as possible after becoming aware
      of a change in holder of the Title.

      However: To respect some Players' wish for privacy, and in
      view of the secret nature of Marks accounts, a prospective
      Marxist must first be asked if e wants the Title. If not, then
      instead of announcing, "Player x is granted the Patent Title of
      'Marxist', e announces, "Patent Title of 'Marxist' is granted
       to an anonymous Player".

========================================

Rule 747 (Mutable)
Definition of a Conserved Quantity

747.  Definition of a Conserved Quantity

      An Entity is only a Conserved Quantity if a Rule explicitly
      states such. A Conserved Quantity may only be Created or
      Destroyed as explicitly stated by the Rules. If a Conserved
      Quantity is given to an Entity, and no Rule states where that
      Conserved Quantity is to be taken from, then the transfer shall
      not take place. If a Conserved Quantity is taken from an Entity,
      and no Rule states where that Conserved Quantity is to be
      transfered to, then the Conserved Quantity shall be transfered
      to the Bank.

      appended to the text of the Rule:  '(*Was: @*)'.
      3.  After clauses 1. and 2. above have been applied, the '@'
      which appears in the last line of text of the Rule shall be

Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal

761.  Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal: Adjusting for Abstentions

      positive Price in Coins, or the form of Mischief is not
      permissible.  This Rule explicitly takes precedence over all
      other Rules which purport to determine which forms of Mischief
      are permissible.

      To cause an Act of Mischief,  X  sends to the Public Forum a
      message containing:
      - the Name of the object, Y;
      - the effect of the Act of Mischief;
      - the Number of the Rule which permits the form of Mischief;
      - indication of which Coins in X's account will be used as
      payment for the Act of Mischief.  Coins of Group Y, or the
      Group to which Player Y belongs, may not be used as payment.  

      The effect of the Act of Mischief is applied immediately upon 
      publication of the above message in the Forum.  An additional
      effect of this Act of Mischief is that
      - for each Coin of Group Z spent as payment above, two Points
      are removed from the Z Treasury;
      - the Coins used as payment above are removed from X's account
      and destroyed.

Rule 766 (Mutable)
Groups

766.  Amend Rule 714.

      A Group is initially formed by a set of Players which has
      registered with the Registrar to form a Group; other Players may
      join later.  Each Group has a Name, a Membership, a Vizier,
      an Ordinancekeepor, a Treasury, an Initial Set of Ordinances,
      and an associated form of Currency, called the <name> Coins,
      where <name> is the Name of the Group.

      1.  The Name may not be the Name of another Group.

      2.  The Membership is a set of Players;  these Players are
      Members of the Group, and all other Players are not.

      3.  Synchronously with the registration of a Group, two Offices
      are created known as the <name> Vizier, and the <name>
      Ordinancekeepor, where <name> is the Name of the Group.
      These Offices may never be empty, and the <name> Vizier and
      <name> Ordinancekeepor must both be a member of <name> Group.
      The <name> Vizier shall inform the Registrar whenever the
      Membership or the Ordinancekeepor of the <name> group changes.
      When the <name> Vizier changes, the new Vizier shall inform the
      Registrar of the change.
      The <name> Ordinancekeepor shall keep an accurate and current
      record of the Ordinances of the <name> Group.

      4.  The Treasury is a repository for Points and Currencies and
      has the same capabilities for holding, trading, and spending
      Points and Currencies as does a Player.

      5.  The Ordinances are a description of the operation of the
      Group.

      6.  The <name> Coins are a form of Currency which is created
      synchronously with the registration of the Group.  The <name>
      Group may create <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be
      placed in the <name> Treasury.  The <name> Group may destroy
      <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be removed from the
      <name> Treasury.

Rule 767 (Mutable)
Votes for Groups

767.  Amend Rule 646.

      If a Group has N Members then it has N Votes for each
      Proposal in addition to those of its Membership.  The
      Ordinances of a Group may determine how and when the Group
      casts its Votes; if the Ordinances are silent on this issue
      then the Group may not cast its Votes.  The Votes of the
      Group are cast when the Vizier sends a message to the Speaker
      to that effect during the Voting Period and this action is
      legitimate insofar as the Ordinances are concerned.

Rule 779 (Mutable)
Sanity

779.  Sanity

      When a Player submits a Proposal, e may pay one Mark to the Bank
      (if e has at least one Mark) and impose Sanity on that Proposal.
      E must inform both the Banker and the Speaker when doing so.
      A Proposal which has Sanity imposed upon it is known as a Sane
      Proposal.  The Speaker shall, when e distributes a Sane
      Proposal, inform the Players that it is a Sane Proposal.

      No non-Voter Nomic entity may Vote on a Sane Proposal.  Each
      Voter shall have exactly one Vote on a Sane Proposal, and
      each Voter's Vote shall be counted exactly once on a Sane
      Proposal.

      This rule takes precedence over any rule allowing a non-Voter
      Nomic entity to Vote; over any rule which gives any Voter
      more or less than one Vote on a proposal; and over any
      rule which would cause any Voter's Vote to be counted more or
      less than once.

Rule 781 (Mutable)
Formal Apologies

781.  Formal Apologies

      If a Player (herein called the Squealer) makes a Call For
      Judgement alleging that a Player (herein called the Ninny) has
      acted or has failed to act in such a way as to be in violation
      of one or more Rules, and this CFJ is Judged TRUE, then the
      Judge must issue an Injunction that the Ninny submit a Formal
      Apology.  This Injunction may also include a list of up to ten
      Prescribed Words.  By a Formal Apology is meant a letter of at
      least 200 words, containing all of the Prescribed Words,
      explaining the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
      for self-improvement, and posted in the Public Forum.  Within 48
      hours of the posting of this Formal Apology, the Squealer must
      either submit a Proposal that the Ninny's Apology be accepted,
      or submit a Proposal that the Ninny's Aplology be rejected,
      but not both.  No other Player may submit such a Proposal, and
      the Squealer may submit only one.  If a Proposal to accept the
      Apology fails, or if a Proposal to reject the Apology passes,
      then the Ninny loses 5 Points.

      Proposals which contain clauses awarding, trading, penalizing,
      or otherwise changing the account of any Nomic Entity's holding
      of Points or any other form of Currency based on the Vote they
      cast on that Proposal are invalid, shall not be deemed to have

Rule 785 (Mutable)
Abandonment of Speakerhood

785.  Improve Speaker Succession I

      If the Speaker has abandoned eir post, another new, Temporary
      Speaker is selected according to the "Rules of Succession", or
      if no such rules are defined, the other Player not on hold with
      the highest Score becomes the temporary Speaker.  This does not
      force the Game to be over in this case, and Scores are not reset
      to 0. The Game continues until a Player Wins, at which time a
      new Game is begun and the Winner becomes the real Speaker. The
      Temporary Speaker shall make reasonable effort to obtain the
      former Speaker's materials: proposal queue, voting records, etc.
      but if this is not possible, then the Temporary Speaker shall
      request that these be resubmitted by the Players. If a Speaker
      is replaced in this manner, e has eir score set to minus 2N
      Points immediately, where N is the number of Points required for
      a Player to Win the Game.

      Abandonment is determined as follows: If any Player suspects
      that the Speaker has Abandoned, e sends a message to all Players
      calling on the Speaker to announce eir presence.  The Speaker
      must reply to all Players within one week; if e does not, e is
      considered to have Abandoned.

Rule 786 (Mutable)
Rule of Succession for Speaker

      Archivist
      Clerk of the Courts
      Rulekeepor
      Distributor
      <all other Officers in descending Point order>
      <all other Voters in descending Point order>

      When a replacement Speaker is required, all Players who are
      willing to become Speaker shall indicate such in a message, sent
      within three days of the Abandonment or resignation of the
      Speaker.  The old Speaker may not send such a message.  This
      message shall be sent to the Speaker, in the case of a Speaker
      voluntarily giving up his position; or to the first Player who
      called for the Speaker to announce his presence, in the case of
      an Abandoned Speaker.

      After three days, the Player ranking highest on the list
      of succession, out of those who indicated a willingness to
      become Speaker, shall become Speaker.

Rule 789 (Mutable)
Injunctions on Interpretations of Rules

789.  Injunction: Interpretation of a Rule

      When a player makes a CFJ alleging that a Rule should be
      interpreted in a certain way, e shall also submit a list of
      Rules relevant to that CFJ, which must include the Rule in
      question.  If the statement is Judged TRUE, the Judge may
      include with the Judgement an Injuction requiring the Rulekeepor
      to annotate the Rule in question with the Statement in the CFJ
      and the list of relevant Rules.

      The annotation shall remain only until one of the Rules
      in the list of relevant Rules is amended, repealed, or
      transmuted; or until a CFJ determines that the injunction no
      longer applies, as described below.  While it remains, it shall
      guide the application of that Rule.

      If a Player believes that the circumstances which led to the
      Judgement no longer prevail and the annotation is therefore no
      longer applicable, e may submit a CFJ to that effect. If it is
      Judged TRUE, the annotation shall be stricken from the rule set.

      Registrar; or in eir absence, the Speaker.  All Players willing
      to hold the Office shall notify the Electioneer of that fact
      within three days of eir announcement of the vacancy.  At the
      end of the three day period, the Electioneer shall randomly
      choose one player from those who indicated a willingness to hold
      the Office, and that Player shall become that Officer.  This
      rule applies to Offices in general, and thus defers to Rules for
      specific Offices.

Rule 791 (Mutable)
Limit on Total Proposals Up for Vote

791.  Limits On Proposals Up For Vote

      There may be no more than PL Proposals up for Vote at any given
      time.  "PL" is the Proposal Limit, which is defined to be 15.

      The Speaker shall enforce this by delaying the distribution of
      Proposals in excess of this number. This Rule takes precedence,
      when permitted, over other Rules which require sooner
      distribution.

      If Proposal "Schemes" exist, then for the purpose of the
      Proposal limit, a Scheme shall count as a single Proposal.

Rule 792 (Mutable)
What Happens When Proposal Limit is Reached

792.  Managing the Proposal Queue

      The Speaker shall notify all Players whenever the number of
      Proposals up for Vote is at the maximum and e has received at
      least PL/2 additional submitted Proposals. However, e may not do
      this until at least 24 hours after the Proposal queue was last
      closed. As soon as this notification appears on the Public
      Forum, Players are prohibited from submitting any more
      Proposals, and the Speaker shall refuse to accept any which are
      inadvertently submitted.

      When the number of Proposals up for Vote has dropped to PL/2 or
      below, the Speaker shall announce that Proposals are once again
      being accepted. After this appears on the Public Forum, Players
      may again submit Proposals.

      excluding those on hold, calling for judgement, whose move is
      under judgement in said CFJ, or have declined appointment on
      this CFJ.

      Voters may decline to serve on a particular case by notifying
      the CotC within 72 hours of appointment.  The declining Player
      shall not be eligible to serve as Judge for this CFJ and shall
      also lose two points, one of which shall be given to the CotC. 

      Upon receiving notice of a Voter declining to serve the CotC
      shall randomly appoint a new Judge from eligible Voters.

Rule 846 (Mutable)
No Double Jeopardy

846.  Criminal Double Jeapordy

      A Player may only be found Guilty once for a particular instance
      of a particular Crime. If a Player admits to being Guilty while
      a Criminal Court is in session to find that Player Guilty, e
      shall suffer the penalties as if e had been found Guilty by a
      Criminal Court. If a Player admits to being Guilty before
      Criminal Court has been called, then a Criminal Court shall not
      be called for that instance of that Crime, and the Player shall
      suffer any penalties for committing the Crime.  This Rule takes
      precedence over other Rules that define when a Criminal Court
      should be called.

Rule 848 (Mutable)
Determining When a Rule Has Been Broken

848.  Determining when a Rule has been broken:

      If a Player believes that any Player has not abided by a Rule
      then in effect, in the form in which it was then in effect, then
      the Player may invoke Judgement on a Statement to that effect.
      Similarly, if a Player believes that any Player has commited a
      Crime, e may invoke Judgement on a Statement to that effect.
      Either kind of Statement is known as an Accusation.  A Criminal
      Court is defined as the Judge of an Accusation.
      However,
        -The Accusing player immediately loses 5 points.
        -No Player may be so Accused of actions committed before the
         adoption of this Rule or more than 30 days before the
         Accusation.
        -No Player may be so Accused more than once concerning the
         same committed act, unless the last such Accusation has been
         judged UNDECIDED.
        -The following exception takes precedence over previous Rules 
         concerning Judgement: Neither Accusing nor Accused Player may
         act as Judge for the Accusation; in any case where this would
         occur, a random Voter, neither Accuser nor Accused, shall be
         Judge.
      If the Statement is judged TRUE, the Accused Player has been
      found Guilty of breaking the Rule or committing the Crime, as
      applicable.  If the Statement is judged FALSE, the Accused
      Player has been found Not Guilty of breaking the Rule or
      committing the Crime, as applicable.

I've been very impressed with "forms" in Mosaic -- voting booths
would be fairly straightforward to implement with Mosaic Forms, i think. 
There's an effective user-voting automation which uses genetic algorithms
to design images on line at Carnegie Mellon or somewhere likethat, I've
a link to it in my home page --- you need mosaic for the pictures, not
just lynx.

I liked the room metaphor, and the fact that I could pick and choose what
I cared to read, with no danger of my mailbox getting overrun if I didn't
want to play for a day or two.  I think a WWW page with well-thought-out
annotation capability could server just as well as Randolph's Threaded
Discussion Boards, but then we would be limited to players who have WWW
browsers.  
     Towards the end, a mail-nomic board gateway was implemented, and
players could sign up toi recieve as mail anything that was posted to a
board, and all the boards grew e-mail addresses for posting to, and
parsed "RE:" subject lines into the corresponding threads for thread
following.  This would be good to keep in the design of the new space
I should think.

     What we do gain with a MUD is the feeling of synchronization and
connectivity, which might be even better served with some sort of
Mosaic application which would open windows for concurrent discussion
whenever more than one person is accessing the Nomic page(s), or the
DISCUSSION PAGE, and we could have irc channel type chats within that
protocol.  I can think of a few ways the windows would look; the best
being an IRC-looing sort of thing which would update the screen for
various players who might be simultaneously typing, eacxh on their own
line,
give the player a new NAME: header and a line whenever he presses RETURN;
otherwise updating each player's communication on their own line, having
some kind of direct character cell location protocol, alternately using  
the who;e typed line as the smallest grain of communication, like a MUD SAY
statement, as is the case in most telnet sorts of protocols rather
than the each-keystroke TALK protocol, which must certainly be a
packetwaster.

I can fantasizze what it would look like, but I have no id3a if it is
implementable; would people need to log in to the discussion page through
some sort of form before they could talk to it?  Has Mosaic the capability
to see whgo it is that is accessing a page?

A way to do it within existing Mosaic might be to allow everyone annotation
capability to certain pages, with timestamping, and set those pages to
automaticly reload every minute or two, or whenever there's a change, and
just having as custom that you sign your notes to the discussion page or
something.

Someting maybe to take up with NCSA for the next version of Mosaic, a
discussion protocol inside it.

A different window for each player would be a hassle, keeping track of the
order of the comments would be nearly impossible.  What we'd want is
a separate window for each topic, like 
IRC channels.

Of course we could acquire an IRC channel and simultaneously log onto it
while browsing the WWW pages, without a MUD, but that would require us all
to familirize ourselves with the obso9lescent IRC technology and protocol.
