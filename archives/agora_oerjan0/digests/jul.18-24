Proto-Proposal (Rescinds a rule)

I propose that:

Rule 462 be rescinded.

Another rule, 754, states that synonyms are not relevant differences in 
communication in Nomic, therefore a rule stating that two synonyms are to 
be taken as having the same meaning is redundant.

Timothy.

Proto-proposal (Recinds a rule)

104 is replaced by 652, so far as I can tell.  At least, these two rules 
appear to have very similar information in them.

I propose 652 is killed completely and

104 is ammended thus:

M.N. was the speaker for the orignal game of of Agora nomic, therefore he 
may use the Patent Title of First Speaker, which cannot be transferred to 
any other person.

Timothy.

Another hole? The end of the Immutables?
Read further on your own risk!
You have been warned!


  Proto-PROPOSAL     (Stella?)
  Repeal an Immutable!
  (Foreign Policy Directive)

  The Ambassador is directed to behave Ambassadorlike.
  And Rule 104 shall be repealed.

===
What is happening here you ask?

Well, Rule 105 says that a Rule change is either:
   (1) the enactment, repeal, or amendment of a mutable Rule;
or (2) the transmutation of an immutable Rule into a mutable Rule
   or vice versa.

This Proposal is therefore *not* a Rule Change, as it does not repeal
a Mutable, but rather an Immutable.

Rule 809 tells us that it is a Foreign Policy Directive:
>      Proposals may be submitted directing the Ambassador on
>      how to conduct a single piece of Foreign Policy business.
>      Such Proposals are automatically Sane, and if passed are
>      binding upon the Ambassador.  If the Ambassador acts
>      contrary to such a Proposal, e may be charged with a
>      Class C Crime.  Such Proposals are submitted with the
>      the following legal Declaration:
>         (Foreign Policy Directive)

However, as the Proposal does not contain any Rule Changes,
according to 891 this makes the Proposal a NRC Proposal:
>      Proposals may be made which do not contain Rule Changes.  All
>      proposals, except those which have one of the following
>      declarations:
>          (Creates a Rule)
>          (Amends a Rule)
>          (Repeals a Rule)
>          (Transmutes a Rule)
>      are Non-Rule-Change Proposals (or NRC Proposals).  However,
>      only those NRC Proposals defined in other Rules may
>      be proposed.

But the same Rule continues:

>      NRC Proposals are Voted upon and treated exactly like other
>      Proposals, and shall be Numbered exactly like other Proposals.

Therefore my proposal to Repeal 104 needs only a *simple* majority to
repeal an Immutable.

So much for the Immutability of the Immutables!

Greetings,
Stella?

PROPOSAL 951 (Steve)
Fix up Barring
(Amends a Rule)

Upon the passage of this proposal, the first paragraph of rule 890
shall be amended to read:

      Upon receipt of a Call For Judgement (CFJ), the Clerk of the
      Courts (CotC) shall randomly appoint a Player to be Judge
      excluding those on hold, barred from Judging said CFJ, calling 
      for judgement, whose move is under judgement in said CFJ, or 
      have declined appointment on this CFJ.
----------------------------
[Note: Currently, rule 897 which legislates barring has no effect,
since 890 takes precedence, and does not tell the CotC to exclude
Barred players when selecting Judges.]

PROPOSAL 952 (Garth)
Suspending the Game:  Limbo
(Creates a Rule)

Let there be a Game State known as Limbo.

When the Game is in Limbo, no official Nomic actions may be taken by
any Player or Entity, and all Players and Entities are absolved of
any Nomic duties they would otherwise perform.

The Game may only enter Limbo upon the passage of a special Decree,
which must explicitly specify the amount of time the Game shall be
in Limbo.  Once the Game leaves Limbo, it shall be restored to the
State immediately before entering Limbo.

Such a Decree need not be recorded, and shall be submitted with the
following legal Declaration:
  (Enter Limbo)

This Rule takes precedence over Rules that would otherwise specify
permitted or required Nomic actions while the Game is in Limbo.

[Allows Oerjan's "Holiday Breaks" if a majority of the Players agree.]

PROPOSAL 953 (Ian)
Clean Up Vototron Rules I
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 574 to include the following paragraph:

      The Speaker is not allowed to make use of the Vototron.

PROPOSAL 954 (Ian)
Clean Up Vototron Rules II
(Repeals a Rule)

If the Proposal titled "Clean Up the Vototron Rules I" passed
then Repeal Rule 688.

PROPOSAL 955 (Garth)
Default Rules for Adopting Proposals
(Amends a Rule)

Rule 761 is Amended in its entirety to read:

When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the Votes which
have been legally cast shall be counted by the Speaker.  Let the
number of Votes in favor of a Proposal divided by the number of
Votes opposed to that Proposal be known as the Voting Factor for
that Proposal.  If the Voting Factor exceeds the mandated
Adoption Factor for a given Proposal, then that Proposal shall
be Adopted.  If the Voting Factor exactly equals the required
Adoption Factor, then the Speaker shall decide whether the
Proposal shall be Adopted, or if the Proposal shall fail.

The Adoption Factor for all Proposals shall be 1, unless otherwise
specified in the Rules.  An Adoption Factor of unanimity is a 
special case:  It is defined as an absence of Votes in opposition,
with at least one Vote in favor.

[ The rationale for this has been given too often to bear repeating.  :)
I would like to note that I did not make the full correction suggested
by KoJen, but only required one Vote in favor.  A few reasons:  1)
Consistency.  A Proposal with an Adoption Factor of 100 passes with one
Vote FOR and the rest abstentions;  why should unanimity be so different?
2) Mass abstention should be punished anyway;  I can't imagine such a
thing happening.  3) I *did* require the one Vote, though, because I
realized that one was needed for 1:0 rather than 0:0. ]

PROPOSAL 956 (Garth)
Contested Proposals
(Creates a Rule)

If a Rule will directly change the actions required of or forbidden
to the Speaker, and the Speaker opposed the Proposal, then that
Proposal shall be considered Contested. The Speaker shall declare
if e opposes the Proposal when e distributes the Proposal.  A
Contested Proposal shall have its Adoption Factor doubled.

PROPOSAL 957 (Garth)
Legislative Custom
(Amends a Rule)

Rule 462 is Amended in its entirety to read:

Votes of FOR or YES are to be considered Votes in favor of a
Proposal.  Votes of AGAINST or NO are to be considered Votes
opposed to a Proposal.  Other Votes are not to be considered
as in favor or opposition.

PROPOSAL 958 (Garth)
No Marks Purchases
(Repeals a Rule)

Rule 533 is hereby Repealed.

[ This is the Rule that lets one buy Marks with Points.  Points and Marks
measure two quite different things.  Let's not cloud the issue. ] 

PROPOSAL 959 (Garth)
No Points Purchases
(Repeals a Rule)

Rule 824 is hereby Repealed.

[ This is the Rule that lets one buy Points with Marks. ]

PROPOSAL 960 (Garth)
No Points Transfers
(Repeals a Rule)

Rule 692 is hereby Repealed.

[ This is the Rule that permits Point Transfers.  We're trying to make
Points an indicator of Game skill.  Transfer of Points muddies that 
issue.  It's usually only done to reward someone anyway - better to use

Addition:

The Pontiff may not be the Speaker for the next game.  Should he or she 
fulfil the victory conditions, he or she may choose the next speaker, so 
long as it is not the Pontiff.

If the current Speaker wins, he or she chooses the new Pontiff, so long 
as it is not the current speaker.

A speaker may not be Pontiff.  A pontiff may not be Speaker.


For those of you without a theological background, I am proposing a 
political system similar to the division of Church and State in medieval 
Europe.

Members of "The Church" are the Colledge of Cardinals, for those of you 
with a religious bent.

The tithe mentioned in the first post is modified thus:

The Church gains the tithe as before, but must pay the "Povery line" 
payments, as alms to the poor.

An indulgence short-circuts the whole legal process.  Either and 
induylgence may be paid in lieu of any fine imposed by the court, or a 
confessor may pay an indulgence.

Indulgences are destroyed after use.

The Church may refuse to indulge someone who has performed a crime 
against the Church.

The Pontiff builds up a large base of power in this game, to use in later 
games.  He or she cannot win this game.  If the tithe goes to the group, 
which then pays some of it out, through the Poverty Line payments, then 
it is not so rapid in its escalation of power.

Note that there is no tithe if the Church does not form.

PROPOSAL 961 (Stella?)
Cure the Mark debt deadlock
(Creates a Rule)

Upon passage of this Rule a number of Marks equal to the total number
Marks that the Bank is in debt, will be created and placed into the
Bank.
Immediately after this change in the Game state is completed, this
Rule shall Repeal itself.

[Cures the backlog of the Bank. First part of an earlier proposal.
Note that the Rule repeals itself, after having functioned.]

PROPOSAL 962 (Stella?)
Criminal Court
(Creates a Rule)

If a Player X commits the Crime descibed in Rule R, then any Player
noticing so, may Call for Judgment on a statement of the form:
"Player X committed the Crime described in Rule R" and e shall
accompagny this CFJ with arguments.
The whole procedure of such a CFJ, its subsequent Judgment and
possible Appeal shall be known as Criminal Court.
If the statement is judged TRUE player X shall be considered guilty of
the Crime and the appropriate penalty shall be applied.

[With excuses to the CotC. I was in a bit of a hurry when I edited
the Proposals I sent off to the Speaker. The purpose of the Rule
is the revival of the Crime system, which in my view could function
as a sort of `paid for' disrespect to the Rules.]

PROPOSAL 963 (Stella?)
Honour
(Creates a Rule)

Let there be an entity called the Kudo (plural: Kudos).
The amount of Kudos a Player holds is called eis Honour.

Initially every Player holds 20 Kudos. New Players shall start with 20
Kudos as well. No Player shall have less than zero Kudos. No Player
shall have a  non-integral number of Kudos.
The number of Kudos held by each Player shall be kept track of by the
Herald (an Officer) and published at least weekly.

No more than once per Nomic week each Player may send a message to the
Herald requesting the transfer of exactly one Kudo from one Player of
eis choice to another Player of eis choice. The requesting Player may
not eimself be the receiving Player.

A Player who holds zero Kudos shall be known and addressed as
`Honourless Worm' and shall address Players with more Honour as `Your
Honour'.

A Player who holds more than fourty Kudos shall be known and addressed
as `Mighty Samourai' and may address Players with less Honour in any
way e sees  fit.

[Down to its basics: the transfer of Honour by request.
E who wants something else may always propose so. Also introduced
the Herald (Officer), as Points are still around apparently, and the
Scorekeepor is thus busy enough figuring out the Scores.
Also taken out the limit in the weekly permitted change in Honour:
on Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday I don't think it's
necessary (and today is Tuesday!)]

Proto-PROPOSAL: Consolidation of Proposal rules.

(Ammends a Rule) 844.  (Repeals a Rule) see listing.

The following are rules changes, since rules changes can appear multiple 
times in a single proposal, and I don't want that fine for multiple 
proposals.

Ammend 884 see below

Kill 597
"    912
"    819
"    455
"    637
"    659
"    891

Rule 884 (Mutable)

There shall be a standard format for Proposals.

The word "PROPOSAL: " must be written at the top of the document.

The word "PROPOSAL:" shall be followed a title, which does not form 
part of the Proposal itself, and therefore does not form part of any
rule enacted or ammended by the proposal.

The line immediately below that on which is written the title there shall 
be a Declaration, describing the effect that the rule change
will have upon the Rule Set.  The Declaration will be a short phrase in 
parantheses, from the following list:

         (Creates a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes a new
         Rule to come into existence.
		The body of a proposal following this declaration must be the 
		finished form of the new rule.   
         (Amends a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes an
         existing Rule to change wording or form.
		The body of a proposal following this must contain the 
		rule number of the rule to be ammended.  It must either
		contain the entire wording of the rule, following its
		ammendment, or quote any portions of the rule to be
		removed, or words to be included.  It must include the
		position of any additions in the text of the ammended rule. 
	 (Repeals a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes an
         existing Rule to cease to exist.
		The body of the proposal must include the number of the 
		rule to be removed from the Set.       
	 (Transmutes a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes a
         Mutable Rule to become Immutable, or vice versa.
		The body after this rule must contain the number of the 
		rule to be transmuted. 
         (Non-Rules Change: x) or (NRC: x) shall be used when the proposal 
	    seeks to alter the current state of the game, but not of the
	    rules.  The Award of a Patent Title, already described in
	    legislation, is an example of this, where the Declaration
	    would be: (NRC: Award of a Patent Title).  Only phrases 
	    defined in other legislation may be used a substitutes for x.
		The number of the rule which defines the NRC phrase must 
		be included in the body of the proposal.
	 (Other) shall be used if no other Declaration has been
            defined which describes the Proposal.
		The number of the rule affected by this declaration must
		be included in the body of the proposal.

 
      Additional legislation may not define additional legal Declarations
      or change the presentation of the Declaration, save through the 
      ammendment of this Rule.  Additional legislation may, however, 
      define N-RC phraes, without ammending this rule. 

      The proposal must conclude with the name of the Proposer.

      Failure to include the term PROPOSAL:, the name of the 
      Proposer, or a required Rule Number makes the proposal invalid.  

      Failure to format correctly is a criminal offence:
        Format Deviation:              Level of Offence:  
        Absence of Title:                               B               
        Absence of Declaration:                         C
        Use of a declaration not defined in this Rule:  A
        Use of an Undefined NRC phrase:                 D

	Any proposal which has more than 70 characters on a single line, 
	or more than 25 lines, requires a processing fee of two points, 
	to be paid to the Point Reserve.  The brevity of a proposal of 10
	or fewer lines is rewarded with a point from the Point Reserve, if it 
	passes.  Those lines which are blank, or solely contain legally
 	required information, do not accrue toward this total.

are, Mr. Speaker, please take me off hold... :)  Thanks...


Have fun!

Score report July 1-20
======================

The following scores are likely to be wrong...
the problem are the Marks Interest for July 4. Although I kept
whining for them since I came back on Sunday, neither the Banker
nor the previous Scorekeepor deemed me worthy enough of sending me
that list.
Therefore I copied the list of June 27 and rely on Rule 925 to get
the error (if any) corrected.

Other remarks:

- I start with the scores as I send them out on July 1.
To my knowledge the Scorekeepor Ad Interim did not send out any
scores. Maybe he could transfer me his 10 Points salary?

- Stocks not yet attributed on July 1, were sold on July 5 and July 11.
The Banker informed me that the Mark transfers involved were effective
July 11.
At the moment TIMOTHY Stock is still up for grabs.

- Welfare (Rule 713) was never paid: Garth's large negative score
always surpasses what's available in the Point Reserve

- Although the Speaker has to announce all changes resulting from
submitting and voting on Proposals (by Rule 937), he didn't take
into account Rule 936 and 947.
By 101 and 925 I feel obliged to include those nevertheless.

- As always: please correct any mistakes ASAP (the easier it is
for me to make the corrections)

Greetings,
Scorekeepor

I believe I have a detected quite a serious error in Speaker Bowen's 
report to the ScoreKeepor concerning the voting results on
proposals 933-950. The error arises from improper application of
rule 833:

Rule 833 (Mutable)

      When the voting period for a proposal is over, the proposer gets
      F-A points, where F is the number of votes FOR, and A is the
      number of votes AGAINST.  However, only the Votes of Voters
      shall be counted for this determination.
      (*Was: 544*)

This implies that certainly Vototron and probably Group votes do NOT
count when determining how many points the proposer of a proposal gets.
But Speaker Bowen has counted them nevertheless:

>           9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9

           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All the underlined scores are incorrect. Assuming that Group votes 
do not count as votes by Voters, and taking into account that the Abelian
Group casts 5 votes and the Vototron 3 votes, the correct scores are:

KoJen: +9 (941) +5 (942)
Michael: +1 (933)
Stella?: +7 (937) -4 (943) -8 (944) -3 (945) -3 (946) +3 (947)
         +8 (948) +10 (949) +2 (950)

Overall these corrections mean the following point changes:

KoJen: -10
Michael: +5
Stella?: -11

I shall make the appropriate CFJ to correct the scores.

Steve

Following my message of this morning trying to make Groups more
active and Group interactions more alive, I PP:
By the way, as these are very likely to meet a lot of resistance
from the Conservative, Headstrong And Silent Majority (CHASM)
I would like Garth to propose them.
As no penalty can touch him (at least this Game) we should profit
all from that.

===
Proto-PROPOSAL     (Stella?)
Joining a Group is obligatory
(Creates a Rule)

A Player not affiliated with any Group shall become a Member of a
Group of eis Choice within two weeks after adoption of this Rule
or within two weeks of the time that that Player became unaffiliated.

[Forces each Player to become a member of a Group, or to form one
with two other Players, if none of the Groups pleases the Player
(or vice versa).]

===
Proto-PROPOSAL     (Stella?)
Reward or Penalty for Proposing
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 833 to read:
When the voting period for a proposal is over, the proposer gets
F-A points, where F is the number of votes FOR, and A is the
number of votes AGAINST.  All other members of the Group to which
the proposer belongs (if any), shall receive (F-A)/2 points.
However, only the Votes of Voters shall be counted for this

Proto-PROPOSAL     (Stella?)
Marks conversions
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 823 to read:
At the end of each game let each Player that did not win, but that
belongs to the same Group as the winner, have eir points be converted
to Marks in a ratio of 50 points to 1 Mark.
The winner's points shall be taken away and e shall not receive any
Mark's compensation for eis points.

Marks for these conversions shall be awarded from the bank as
directed by the Ruleset.
[Encourage conspiracies of Groups against others.]

===
Proto-PROPOSAL     (Stella?)
Special priviliges to skillful Groups
(Creates a Rule)

At the beginning of each Nomic Week the Scorekeepor shall calculate
for each Group the average score of the members of that Group.
The members of the Group with the highest average score will have
the following priviliges during that Nomic Week:
- to submit Proposals without the Penalty for submitting
proposals being levied;
- to bar three Players from being Judge on each of the
CFJ's submitted that Nomic week;
- to declare a Proposal Sane;
- etc

[These are only ideas: I would prefer to put the actual
priviliges in other Proposals, so that they may be voted on
separately.]

Greetings,
Stella?

Score report July 1-21 (corrected)
==================================

Same thing as this morning with the correct Marks Interest for July 4.
Doesn't change much: the Marxist gets a little bit more Interest.

I didn't take Steve's remark about 833 into account. For some reason
I can not get myself to believe him as yet.

I also detected a tiny error that nobody noticed before.

Other remarks (repeated):

- I start with the scores as I send them out on July 1.
To my knowledge the Scorekeepor Ad Interim did not send out any
scores. Maybe he could transfer me his 10 Points salary?

- Stocks not yet attributed on July 1, were sold on July 5 and July 11.
The Banker informed me that the Mark transfers involved were effective
July 11.
At the moment TIMOTHY Stock is still up for grabs.

- Welfare (Rule 713) was never paid: Garth's large negative score
always surpasses what's available in the Point Reserve

- Although the Speaker has to announce all changes resulting from
submitting and voting on Proposals (by Rule 937), he didn't take
into account Rule 936 and 947.
By 101 and 925 I feel obliged to include those nevertheless.

- As always: please correct any mistakes ASAP (the easier it is
for me to make the corrections)

Greetings,
Scorekeepor

Oops, yes, of course. This shows how far out of touch I am with the Rule
Set. The problem is, it's such a frustrating experience to look at it, with it
being in 6 parts, and having no structural organization.

A really quick set of protoproposals here, which if done right, might fix
things up. This is something I've wanted for 9 months, but haven't got around
to proposing it. This is admiteddly a quick sloppy first draft, but I hope
there's substantial interest on this and we can fix it up.


P.S. I hereby disclaim three fourths of any Point and Marks gains as a direct
result of the resulting proposals, should they pass. I will make my best effort
to distribute the gains in an equitible manner among those who offer useful
feedback and/or vote for them.

This is how important I believe this issue is.


protoproposal XXX
Rule Set Format
(creates a rule)

The Rulekeepor is required to publish the Rules in a format known by convention
as the "Logical Rule Set Format". This is the only Officially sanctioned format
for the Rule Set, which will fulfil the Rulekeepor's duties.

This is the format currently made available by Chuck Carroll for purchase, and
for free to new Players.

Upon adoption of this Rule, the Rulekeepor shall assign each existing Rule to a
category. These category assignments shall be essentially similar to those in
effect in Chuck Carroll's personal Logical Rule Set format at the time of this
Rule's passage, or, if he has ceased to maintain his L.R.S. in a meaningful
way, at the time of the last meaningful available L.R.S.

Chuck Carroll shall be awarded a one-time bonus of 25 Points or 1 Mark -- his
choice -- as compensation and appreciation for his work in organizing the
L.R.S.


protoproposal YYY
Category Assignment When Proposing
(creates a rule)

When a Player proposes a new Rule, e may include a statement of the form, "This
Rule shall be listed in category <X>". This must be the name of an existing
category in the L.R.S; if not, that portion of the proposal is invalid and the
Rulekeepor shall choose an appropriate category. The Rule, if adopted, shall be
listed in that category.

The Rulekeepor must abide by this assignment, if given. However, if the
category assignment is not given, the Rulekeepor is free to assign it to the
category which e feels is most appropriate.


protoproposal XXX
Categories Change Within The Rules
(creates a rule)

The category under which a Rule is listed may not be changed except as
specifically allowed within the Rules.


protoproposal AAA
Adding new Rule Categories
(creates a rule)

A new category may be created for the Logical Rule Set, by a proposal to do so.
This shall be voted on like any other proposal. The adoption factor is 2. The
notation for this type of proposal is "creates a rule category".


protoproposal BBB
Moving Rules Around
(creates a rule)

A rule may be moved from one category to another by a proposal to do so. This
shall be voted on like any other proposal. The adoption factor is 2. The
notation for this type of proposal is "changes a rule's category".

Proto-Proposal A
Allow Temporary Rules
(creates a rule)

Proposals may include the following declaration:

(creates a temporary rule)

Any Proposals passed with this declaration shall take effect in the same manner
as Proposals passed with the (creates a rule) declaration.  Any actions the
Rule performs as soon as it is created will be performed according to the
Rules, and then the Rule will be immediately repealed.

[Many Rules were created to perform a function, and are now extraneous as they
have completed their function, or required separate Proposals to repeal them. 
This Proposal would eliminate the need for specific language in such proposals
to repeal themselves or the need for later proposals to repeal these extraneous
Rules.]

Rule NNN (Immutable or Mutable)
      Text of Rule
========================================
The Game of eNomic
----------------------------------------
Rule 913 (Mutable)
Name is Agora
913.  The Name of the Game
      The Official Name of this Nomic shall be Agora.
----------------------------------------
Rule 101 (Immutable)
      All Players must always abide by all the Rules then in effect,
      in the form in which they are then in effect.  The Rules in the
      Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the first game.
      The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (Immutable) and
      201-219 (Mutable).
----------------------------------------
Rule 116 (Immutable)
      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
      and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
      which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly or
      implicitly permits it.
----------------------------------------
Rule 450 (Mutable)
      Any Entity which is created by the Nomic Rules, and which exists only
      within the context of the current Game of Nomic, such as Points,
      Votes, etc. may *not* be changed by any action other than those
      specified by the Rules.
----------------------------------------
Rule 113 (Immutable)
      A Player always has the option to forfeit the Game rather than
      continue to play or incur a Game penalty.  No penalty worse than
      losing, in the judgment of the Player to incur it, may be
      imposed.
----------------------------------------
Rule 478 (Mutable)
      The Public Forum is hereby defined as any medium by which one
      player sends or posts a message which, to the best of the
      sender's intent, knowledge, belief, and ability, is
      simultaneously sent to all active players and accurately dated
      to within 5 minutes. The terms "listserv" and "listserver" are
      synonymous with "Public Forum".
----------------------------------------
Rule 754 (Mutable)
      Differences in spelling, grammar, or dialect, or the
      substitution of a word or phrase by a synonym or abbreviation,
      are inconsequential in all forms of Nomic communication, as long
      as there is no ambiguity in meaning. In other words, the meaning
      or validity of such communication is not altered in any way by
      such discrepancies.
      (*Was: 435*)
----------------------------------------
Rule 795 (Mutable)
Accurate Quoting Shall Not Be Penalized
795.  Remove a Non-Existant Example
      When a Player quotes a Rule, Proposal, Statement, Judgement, the
      words of another Player, or other references, that Player shall
      not be penalized in points for the terminology or grammar used
      in those quotes.  This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule
      which specifies terminology or grammar.
      (*Was: 362*)
----------------------------------------
Rule 459 (Mutable)
      The Nomic Week begins at midnight, GMT, each Monday. Any
      automatic change in the state of the Game which must occur
      weekly occurs at the beginning of the Nomic Week unless
      otherwise stated in the Rules. Any activity which must occur
      at least weekly must occur at least once each Nomic Week.
----------------------------------------
Rule 907 (Mutable)
Definition of "As Soon As Possible"
907.
      Whenever a Player is required to perform a certain action "as
      soon as possible", e is required to perform this action before
      performing any other actions which have a less strictly defined
      time requirement.  However, activity of a purely discussionary
      nature is excluded from the ordering requirement, and may be
      conducted at any time.
      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which stipulate a
      less stringent ordering requirement for the performance of these
      actions.
      (*Was: 805*)
----------------------------------------
========================================
The Rules (and Decrees and FPD's)
----------------------------------------
Rule 102 (Immutable)
      Initially Rules in the 100's are Immutable and Rules in the
      200's are Mutable.  Rules subsequently Enacted or Transmuted
      (that is, changed from Immutable to Mutable or vice versa) may
      be Immutable or Mutable regardless of their Numbers, and Rules
      in the Initial Set may be Transmuted regardless of their Numbers.
----------------------------------------
Rule 114 (Immutable)
      There must always be at least one Mutable Rule.  The adoption of
      Rule Changes must never become completely inpermissible.
----------------------------------------
Rule 111 (Immutable)
      In a conflict between a Mutable and an Immutable Rule, the
      immutable Rule takes precedence and the Mutable Rule shall be
      entirely void.  For the purposes of this Rule a Proposal to
      Transmute an Immutable Rule does not "conflict" with that
      Immutable Rule.
----------------------------------------
Rule 212 (Mutable)
      If two or more Mutable Rules conflict with one another, or if
      two or more Immutable Rules conflict with one another, then the
      Rule with the lowest ordinal Number takes precedence.
        If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of rule) or takes
      precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.
        If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.
----------------------------------------
Rule 895 (Immutable)
RC and NRC Proposals
895.  Other Rule Changes and Proposals
      New kinds of Rule Changes may be defined by the Rules, so long
      as they Create, Amend, Repeal, Transmute, or otherwise change
      one or more Rules, without making any other direct changes to
      the Game State.
      All proposed Rule Changes are Proposals.  Other kinds of
      Proposal may be defined by the Rules.  They shall be treated as
      proposed Rule Changes in all respects, save that they shall not
      change any Rule in any way, and they shall not under any
      circumstances be incorporated into the Ruleset.  A given class
      of such Proposals shall not be valid unless the Rules define
      which Player or Players must maintain a current record of that
      class of Proposals, or explicitly state that that class need not
      be recorded.
      The first paragraph of this Rule does not apply to Proposals
      that are not Rule Changes.
      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules describing the
      nature of Rule Changes and/or proposed Rule Changes.
----------------------------------------
Rule 893 (Mutable)
Precedence of FPD's
893.  Precedence of FPDs
      Newer foreign policy directives take precedence over older ones.
      A foreign policy directive may be dropped from the records only
      after it has explicitly been superceded in another foreign
      policy directive.
----------------------------------------
Rule 900 (Mutable)
Decrees
900.  Recording Decrees
      Proposals that are not proposed Rule Changes are known as
      Decrees.
      The Clerk of the Courts shall maintain a current record of all
      Decrees to Appeal Judgements.
      The Ambassador shall maintain a current record of all Foreign
      Policy Directives.
      The Rulekeepor shall maintain a current record of all other
      Decrees that have a continuing legal effect.
      Decrees to Award Titles or Run for Offices need not be recorded.
      The Archivist shall maintain a record of all other Decrees.
      This Rule applies to Decrees in general, and defers to the Rules
      for specific types of Decrees.
----------------------------------------
========================================
The Players
----------------------------------------
Rule 869 (Mutable)
Registered Players
869.  Registered Players
      A Player is any person who is registered as a Player.  No person
      may be registered as a Player more than once concurrently.
      (*Was: 498*)
----------------------------------------
Rule 103 (Immutable)
      At any time, each Player shall be either a Voter or the Speaker;
      no Player may simultaneously be a Voter and a Speaker. At any
      time, there shall be exactly one Speaker. The term "Player" in
      the Rules shall specifically include both the Voters and the
      Speaker.
----------------------------------------
Rule 494 (Mutable)
      The Speaker shall make all random determinations required by the
      Rules except when the Rules specify another party to make the
      determination.
----------------------------------------
Rule 104 (Immutable)
      The Speaker for the first game shall be Michael Norrish.
----------------------------------------
Rule 870 (Mutable)
Putting Oneself on Hold
870.  Putting Oneself On Hold
      A Player may choose to be placed On Hold at any time by
      notifying the Speaker of the fact. The Speaker shall then
      notify all other Players.  If a Player wishes to cease being On
      Hold, that Player shall notify the Speaker of the fact. The
      Speaker shall then notify all other Players.  A Player may not
      be On Hold for less than 96 consecutive hours.
      While On Hold, a Player may not Vote, propose Proposals,
      or campaign for or hold Office.  E is also absolved of any
      duties which would otherwise be required of eim, including
      appointment as a Judge
      (*Was: 464*)
----------------------------------------
Rule 474 (Mutable)
      A player may not be deregistered from the game, except by that
      player (or the Registrar, as specified elsewhere) announcing
      that he forfeits.  When a player forfeits, he remains registered
      for a length of time equal to the longest possible voting period
      on a proposal. At the end of this time, he is deregistered.
      During the time between forfeiting and being deregistered, the
      player may not vote or make a proposal.  The player
      automatically refuses any selection for judgement, or any other
      voluntary appointed duties.
      If, at any time during this period, the player announces that
      they have changed their mind about forfeiting, then these
      restrictions are instantly revoked, and the deregistration does
      not take place.
----------------------------------------
Rule 460 (Mutable)
      A Player not On Hold who fails to post a message to the
      listserv, cast a Vote, or submit a Proposal or CFJ for 14
      consecutive calendar days is deemed to have left the Game and
      shall be removed from the list of Players. If the former Player
      re-enters the same Game, it shall be with the same score as when
      e left and e shall not be considered a new Player. Otherwise, e
      shall enter on the same terms as a new Player.
----------------------------------------
========================================
Making Proposals
----------------------------------------
Rule 105 (Immutable)
      A Rule Change is any of the following:  (1) the enactment,
      repeal, or amendment of a mutable Rule; or (2) the transmutation
      of an immutable Rule into a mutable Rule or vice versa.
        (Note:  This definition implies that, at least initially, all
      new Rules are Mutable; Immutable Rules, as long as they are
      Immutable, may not be Amended or Repealed; Mutable Rules, as long
      as they are Mutable, may be Amended or Repealed; any Rule of any
      status may be Transmuted; no Rule is absolutely immune to change.)
----------------------------------------
Rule 115 (Immutable)
      Rule Changes that affect Rules needed to allow or apply
      Rule Changes are as permissible as other Rule Changes.  Even
      Rule Changes that amend or repeal their own authority are
      permissible.  No Rule Change or type of move is impermissible
      solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a
      Rule.
----------------------------------------
Rule 107 (Immutable)
      Any proposed Rule Change must be written down (or otherwise
      communicated in print media) before it is voted on. If adopted,
      it must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.
----------------------------------------
Rule 594 (Mutable)
      A Proposal may contain one or more Rule Changes. If the Proposal
      is Adopted, then the Rule Change(s) contained within that
      Proposal shall take effect. All Proposals are Voted upon and
      treated exactly like Rule Changes, and shall be Numbered exactly
      like Rule Changes. This Rule takes precedence over all other
      Rules.
      At the moment that Rule 105 is Transmuted, this Rule shall be
      Amended to read:
      A Proposal may contain one or more Rule Changes. If the Proposal
      is Adopted, then the Rule Change(s) contained within that
      Proposal shall take effect. No Proposal may Enact or Amend more
      than one Rule.
----------------------------------------
Rule 404 (Mutable)
      As long as a Proposal satisfies all requirements in place at the
      time of its making for the proper making of Proposals, the act
      of making such a Proposal is legal regardless of its content.
      It is legal to propose a Rule which conflicts with other Rules
      or with itself, which is paradoxical, or which cannot be
      applied.
----------------------------------------
Rule 415 (Mutable)
      A Proposal by a Voter shall be made by submitting it to the
      Mighty Speaker. As soon as possible after receiving the
      Proposal, the Mighty Speaker shall assign the Proposal a Number
      and distribute the Proposal along with its number to all
      Players.
      The Mighty Speaker may also make Proposals. The Mighty Speaker
      must process all pending Voter-submitted Proposals first, and
      may then Process Proposals of the Mighty Speaker, assigning
      these Proposals a number and distributing them in the same
      fashion as any other Proposal.
----------------------------------------
Rule 109 (Immutable)
      The Speaker shall give each proposed Rule Change a Number for
      reference.  The numbers shall begin with 301, and each Rule
      Change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next
      successive integer, whether or not the Proposal is adopted.
        If a Rule is Repealed and Reenacted, it receives the Number of
      the Proposal to Reenact it.  If a Rule is Amended or Transmuted,
      it receives the Number of the Proposal to Amend or Transmute it.
----------------------------------------
Rule 597 (Mutable)
      Every Proposal shall be headed with a Title. This Title shall
      not actually be a part of the Proposal itself and therefore
      shall not become a part of any Rule Enacted or Amended by that
      Proposal. If a Proposal is not headed with a Title, then the
      Player who submitted that Proposal shall be guilty of a Class B
      Crime.
----------------------------------------
Rule 884 (Mutable)
Declaring Proposals
884.  Declaring Proposals
      All Proposals must declare what effect that Proposal will have
      on the Rule Set. If said Proposal has a Title, this Declaration
      shall appear on the line immediately below that Title. In any
      case, the Declaration shall appear in parentheses. A Player who
      submits a proposal which does not include a Declaration, as
      described here and in other legislation, shall be guilty of a
      Class C Crime. Any Player who submits a proposal which includes
      a Declaration that has not been approved by legislation shall be
      guilty of a Class A Crime.  The Declarations shall be as
      follows:
         (Creates a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes a new
            Rule to come into existance.
         (Amends a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes an
            existing Rule to change wording or form.
         (Repeals a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes an
            existing Rule to cease to exist.
         (Transmutes a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes a
            Mutable Rule to become Immutable, or vice versa.
         (Other) shall be used if no other Declaration has been
            defined which describes the Proposal.
      Additional legislation may define additional legal Declarations
      or change the presentation of the Declaration, but this Rule
      shall take precedence in all other cases.
      (*Was: 454*)
----------------------------------------
Rule 912 (Mutable)
Additional Declarations
912.  Get Rid of Appeal By Proposal
      There shall be additional legal Declarations which are as
      follows:
         (Award a Patent Title) shall be used if the Proposal does not
            Enact a Rule, but awards an existing Patent Title to a
            person.
         (Run for Office) shall be used if a Proposal seeks to place a
            Player in Office, according to the Rules for Offices.
      (*Was: 650/799*)
----------------------------------------
Rule 455 (Mutable)
      Any Player who submits a Proposal which does not include a
      Declaration, as described in other legislation, shall be guilty
      of a Class C Crime.  Any Player who submits a Proposal which
      includes a Declaration which has not been approved by
      legislation shall be guilty of a Class A Crime.
----------------------------------------
Rule 637 (Mutable)
      If a Proposal seeks to Amend or Repeal a Rule, that Proposal
      must refer to that Rule either by that Rule's number or by its
      Title as given in the latest distributed Current Rule Set.
      If a Proposal seeks to Amend a Rule, that Proposal must
      explicitly state how in one of two ways: Either the Proposal
      must restate the entire Rule, or the Proposal must quote the
      phrases or words to be deleted (if any) and the phrases or words
      to be inserted (as well as the location of such insertion) or
      appended (if any). If a Proposal attempts to Ammend a Rule
      without following these guidelines, it shall not be considered
      to have been properly submitted, and shall not be Voted upon.
----------------------------------------
Rule 659 (Mutable)
      Whenever a Proposal is submitted which contains more than 70
      characters on a single line or longer than 25 lines, the Player
      to propose that Proposal shall lose two Points. Whenever a
      Proposal passes that is no longer than 10 lines, the Player to
      propose that Proposal shall recieve one Point.
----------------------------------------
Rule 748 (Mutable)
      Whenever the length of a Proposal is determined, any blank lines
      within that Proposal shall not be counted towards the number of
      lines in that Proposal. In addition, any lines which are
      required by legislation, including a Title or a Declaration,
      shall likewise not be counted towards the number of lines in
      that Proposal.
----------------------------------------
Rule 657 (Mutable)
      No Rule which contains a reference to another Rule by Number may
      be Transmuted into an Immutable Rule. Any Propsal which attempts
      to do this shall be invalid and shall not be Voted upon.
----------------------------------------
Rule 783 (Mutable)
      Proposals which contain clauses awarding, trading, penalizing,
      or otherwise changing the account of any Nomic Entity's holding
      of Points or any other form of Currency based on the Vote they
      cast on that Proposal are invalid, shall not be deemed to have
      been properly submitted, and shall not be Voted upon.
      (*Was: 326*)
----------------------------------------
Rule 779 (Mutable)
      When a Player submits a Proposal, e may pay one Mark to the Bank
      (if e has at least one Mark) and impose Sanity on that Proposal.
      E must inform both the Banker and the Speaker when doing so.
      A Proposal which has Sanity imposed upon it is known as a Sane
      Proposal.  The Speaker shall, when e distributes a Sane
      Proposal, inform the Players that it is a Sane Proposal.
      No non-Voter Nomic entity may Vote on a Sane Proposal.  Each
      Voter shall have exactly one Vote on a Sane Proposal, and
      each Voter's Vote shall be counted exactly once on a Sane
      Proposal.
      This rule takes precedence over any rule allowing a non-Voter
      Nomic entity to Vote; over any rule which gives any Voter
      more or less than one Vote on a proposal; and over any
      rule which would cause any Voter's Vote to be counted more or
      less than once.
----------------------------------------
Rule 936 (Mutable)
Discourages Too Many Proposals
936.  Proposal Discouragement, not Limit
      When a player submits a Proposal to the Speaker, e shall lose 1
      point for each Proposal proposed by em which either is currently
      up for Vote, or has been sent to the Speaker but not yet

      successor.
      If an Officer resigns while a Proposal is being voted upon to

      invoke Judgement by submitting a Statement for Judgement to the
      Clerk of the Courts.  Disagreement, for the purposes of this
      Rule, may be created by the insistence of any Player.  When
      Judgement is invoked, the Clerk of the Courts must, as soon as
      possible, select a Judge as described in the Rules.  The Clerk
      of the Courts must then distribute the Statement to be judged,
      along with the identity of the Judge, to all Players.
----------------------------------------
Rule 662 (Mutable)
      A "Move" refers to any specific action taken by a Player or
      group of Players in the context of the game. Any invocation of
      Judgement must satisfy one or more of the following conditions:
          - clearly allege that a specific Move is illegal;
          - clearly allege that a specific Rule is illegal or lacking
            in legal force, in whole or in part;
          - clearly allege that a specific Rule ought to be
            interpreted in a certain way.
          - clearly allege that the current published game state is
            incorrect, and in what respects.
      A CFJ which does not satisfy at least one of the above
      conditions shall be deemed invalid and shall not be accepted for
      Judgement by the Clerk of the Courts. However, this Rule shall
      defer to rules which explictly permit CFJs that do not
      necessarily meet the above conditions.

      under judgement in said CFJ, or have declined appointment on
      this CFJ.
      Players may decline to serve on a particular case by notifying
      the CotC within 72 hours of appointment.  The declining Player

Delivering Judgement

Rule 408 (Mutable)
      After the Clerk of the Courts has distributed the Statement to
      be judged and the identity of the Judge, the Judge has one week
      in which to deliver a legal Judgement.  If the Judge fails to
      deliver a Judgement within this time, e is penalized 10 points
      and a new Judge is selected.  A Judgement is delivered by
      submitting that Judgement to the Clerk of the Courts, who must
      then distribute that Judgement to all Players as soon as
      possible.
----------------------------------------
Rule 591 (Mutable)
      A legal Judgement is either TRUE, FALSE, or UNDECIDED. The
      Judgement must be accompanied by reasons and arguments, which
      include, but are not necessarily limited to, citations of
      deciding Rules, past Judgements, and game custom. A Judgement
      delivered without reasons and/or arguments is completely invalid.
      Such reasons and arguments form no part of the Judgement itself.
      However, the Clerk of the Courts must distribute the reasons and
      arguments along with the Judgement.
----------------------------------------
Rule 217 (Mutable)
      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however, if
      the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the Statement
      to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider Game Custom and the
      Spirit of the Game before applying other standards.
----------------------------------------
Rule 451 (Mutable)
      When a CFJ makes a Statement about the current state of the
      Game, the result of that CFJ shall be TRUE if and only if the
      Judge feels that that Statement was correct at the time that the
      CFJ was *issued*. Any changes that have happened in the time
      between the issuing of the CFJ and its delivery must be figured
      in to find the correct current state.

Rule 502 (Mutable)
      A Judge who delivers a legal Judgment or Decision
      within the mandated time receives 3 Points.
      A Judge who delivers a legal Judgment or Decision
      within 72 hours receives 2 Points extra.
----------------------------------------
Rule 663 (Mutable)
      There shall be an entity known as an Injunction, which may
      accompany certain Judgements of TRUE or FALSE as provided in the
      rules. An Injunction is a statement or series of statements
      specifying an action or actions which must take place. If a
      Judgement is is accompanied by an Injunction, that Injunction
      must be published with the Judgement. All players must abide by
      the Injunction beginning no later than 72 hours after its
      publication unless one of the following conditions then apply:
        - The Judgement which the Injunction accompanies is undergoing
          appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of the appeal
          process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but a proposal
          has been published which would overturn that decision if
          passed, and said proposal has not failed.
        - The validity of the Injunction itself is questioned by a
          pending CFJ.
        - A Judgement upholding the validity of the Injunction is
          undergoing appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of
          the appeal process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but
          a proposal has been published which would overturn that
          decision if passed, and said proposal has not failed.
      A Judgement may not be accompanied by an Injunction unless it is
      specifically permitted elsewhere in the rules. An Injunction
      must be completely consistent with all rules in effect at the
      time of issuance, and must be completely relevant to the matter
      addressed in the corresponding judgement.
      If any Player believes that an Injunction or any part of it does
      not meet the criteria for a valid Injunction, e may submit a CFJ
      to that effect. If the resulting Judgement supports the
      contention that the criteria are not met, the Injunction shall
      be considered illegal and shall have no legal force.
      This rule takes precedence over all rules governing Injunctions.
----------------------------------------
Rule 664 (Mutable)
      If a Judge hands down an Injunction which is determined illegal
      by a CFJ, then a Criminal Court may find em GUILTY of a Class C
      crime.
----------------------------------------
Rule 669 (Mutable)
      If the rules require a Player to obey an Injunction and e fails
      to do so, then a Criminal Court may find that Player GUILTY of a
      Class C crime.
----------------------------------------
Rule 665 (Mutable)
      If a CFJ alleges that a specific Move is illegal, and the
      Judgement supports the allegation, the Judge may include with
      the Judgement an Injunction specifying that the move is to be
      retracted, and any resulting adjustments to the published game
      state. The adjustments to the game state must have been
      unambiguously specified within the CFJ, and these adjustments
      must only undo actions which were a direct or indirect result of
      that Move.
----------------------------------------
Rule 789 (Mutable)
      When a player makes a CFJ alleging that a Rule should be
      interpreted in a certain way, e shall also submit a list of
      Rules relevant to that CFJ, which must include the Rule in
      question.  If the statement is Judged TRUE, the Judge may
      include with the Judgement an Injuction requiring the Rulekeepor
      to annotate the Rule in question with the Statement in the CFJ
      and the list of relevant Rules.
      The annotation shall remain only until one of the Rules
      in the list of relevant Rules is amended, repealed, or
      transmuted; or until a CFJ determines that the injunction no
      longer applies, as described below.  While it remains, it shall
      guide the application of that Rule.
      If a Player believes that the circumstances which led to the
      Judgement no longer prevail and the annotation is therefore no
      longer applicable, e may submit a CFJ to that effect. If it is
      Judged TRUE, the annotation shall be stricken from the rule set.

      If a Judgement is successfully Appealed, the Justices shall each
      Judge the Statement as if they were Judges.  They may confer
      with each other on the case before delivering Judgement if they
      desire.  If a Justice should fail to return Judgement in the
      allotted time, e shall be fined three Points for each day by
      which e missed the deadline.  This fine shall be levied by the
      Scorekeepor.
      If a majority of the Justices' Judgements agree, the Statement
      shall be considered to have been Judged accordingly.  Otherwise,
      it shall be considered to have been ruled UNDECIDED.  The
      Justices' reasoning and arguments shall be recorded with the
      original CFJ.
      Once a Judgement has been made, the Justices may make
      Injunctions just as may Judges, provided a majority of them
      agree.
      The decision of the Justices is final; no further Appeal of that
      Statement may be made.

Rule Violations and Criminal Court

Rule 848 (Mutable)
Determining When a Rule Has Been Broken
848.  Determining when a Rule has been broken:
      If a Player believes that any Player has not abided by a Rule
      then in effect, in the form in which it was then in effect, then
      the Player may invoke Judgement on a Statement to that effect.
      Similarly, if a Player believes that any Player has commited a
      Crime, e may invoke Judgement on a Statement to that effect.
      Either kind of Statement is known as an Accusation.  A Criminal
      Court is defined as the Judge of an Accusation.
      However,
        -The Accusing player immediately loses 5 points.
        -No Player may be so Accused of actions committed before the
         adoption of this Rule or more than 30 days before the
         Accusation.
        -No Player may be so Accused more than once concerning the
         same committed act, unless the last such Accusation has been
         judged UNDECIDED.
        -The following exception takes precedence over previous Rules
         concerning Judgement: Neither Accusing nor Accused Player may
         act as Judge for the Accusation; in any case where this would
         occur, a random Voter, neither Accuser nor Accused, shall be
         Judge.
      If the Statement is judged TRUE, the Accused Player has been
      found Guilty of breaking the Rule or committing the Crime, as
      applicable.  If the Statement is judged FALSE, the Accused
      Player has been found Not Guilty of breaking the Rule or
      committing the Crime, as applicable.

      direct result of that accusation.  In addition, he shall receive
      a reward of three additional points, or the number of points
      which the convicted player loses as a result of his conviction,
      whichever is less.

Rule 908 (Mutable)
Formal Apologies
908.  Time Requirement for Formal Apologies
      If a Player (herein called the Squealer) makes a Call For
      Judgement alleging that a Player (herein called the Ninny) has
      acted or has failed to act in such a way as to be in violation
      of one or more Rules, and this CFJ is Judged TRUE, then the
      Judge must issue an Injunction that the Ninny submit a Formal
      Apology.  This Injunction may also include a list of up to ten
      Prescribed Words.  By a Formal Apology is meant a letter of at
      least 200 words, containing all of the Prescribed Words,
      explaining the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
      for self-improvement, and posted in the Public Forum within 72
      hours of the posting of the Injunction to the Public Forum.
      If the Ninny fails to meet these criteria e shall lose 10
      points.  Within 72 hours of the posting of this Formal Apology,
      the Squealer must either submit a Proposal that the Ninny's
      Apology be accepted, or submit a Proposal that the Ninny's
      Aplology be rejected, but not both.  No other Player may submit
      such a Proposal, and the Squealer may submit only one.  If a
      Proposal to accept the Apology fails, or if a Proposal to reject
      the Apology passes, then the Ninny loses 5 Points.

      be called for that instance of that Crime, and the Player shall

Rule 417 (Mutable)
      That there be established an office known as the Nomic
      Archivist, which shall be governed by the default Rules
      concerning official posts. The initial duties of the Nomic
      Archivist shall be to record the passage and failure of
      Proposals, to maintain a "historical record" (defined below)
      of the Ruleset, to maintain a list of Judgements and their case
      histories, and to maintain a list of game Winners in past games.
      The Archivist is free to comment on the historical records as
      they see fit, but such commentary must be clearly delimited
      from the historical material. Where the material being stored
      does not already admit a classification method, the Archivist
      is free to design one themselves.
      The "historical record" of the Ruleset maintained by the
      Archivist is one that includes all rules ever part of the nomic
      Ruleset, annotated with information as to their ultimate fate,
      whether Repealed or Amended etc. This record of the Ruleset has
      no legal force.
      The duties required of the Archivist may be changed with their
      consent and at the request of the Office's controlling body
      (whatsoever that may be). Initially, the controlling body of
      this Office shall be all Players, and any request to change the
      duties must therefore be supported by a majority of Players
      "speaking" to the request.  Naturally, default Rules for
      Offices may establish a different controlling body for this
      Office.
      The salary of the Archivist office shall be determined by its
      controlling body. Initially, its salary shall be 5 points and

      beginning of the Nomic Week, then each such active Player's
      score shall be increased to the Poverty Line by transferring
      points from the Point Reserve, provided there are sufficient
      points therein to cover all such transfers.
      A Player shall not receive points under this rule if e

       (c) a Player may not transfer more Points than e currently has
       (d) a Player may not transfer Points if the recipient would as
      a result have more than 90% of the Points required to Win.
      If any agreement among Players includes any transfer of Points
      between two Players then each such transfer shall be in
      accordance with the above.  But this Rule shall not be construed
      as having any bearing on the legality or legal enforceability of
      any terms of said agreement which do not involve such a
      transfer.
      All Nomic Entities shall abide by the above limits whenever
      Points are traded.  If a Nomic Entity must trade Points by the
      current Rules but would end up breaking the above limits, then
      the Nomic Entity trades the maximum amount possible without
      breaking any of the above limits.  This Rule shall have
      precedence over all other Rules pertaining to the Trading of
      Points.

Rule 649 (Mutable)
      Let there be a new Nomic Entity known as a Patent Title. A
      Player may nominate a person for a Patent Title by submitting a
      Proposal to that effect. If this Proposal passes, the person in
      question shall be known to all Players by that Patent Title. If
      the Proposal fails, that person may not be nominated for the
      same Patent Title for a period of 4 weeks.  If the Rule which
      creates the Patent Title specifies another method of assigning

      this Rule. The Registrar shall keep track of all Patent Titles
      which have been granted.
----------------------------------------
Rule 653 (Mutable)
      Any Player who holds a Patent Title may refer to themselves by

Rule 747 (Mutable)
      An Entity is only a Conserved Quantity if a Rule explicitly
      states such. A Conserved Quantity may only be Created or
      Destroyed as explicitly stated by the Rules. If a Conserved
      Quantity is given to an Entity, and no Rule states where that
      Conserved Quantity is to be taken from, then the transfer shall
      not take place. If a Conserved Quantity is taken from an Entity,
      and no Rule states where that Conserved Quantity is to be
      transfered to, then the Conserved Quantity shall be transfered
      to the Bank.

      restriction does not apply to Proposals which define new
      Conserved Quantities or Create the initial stock of a new

----------------------------------------
Rule 610 (Mutable)
      Marks and Coins are Currencies.  Each type of Coin is a separate
      Currency.  Other rules may define other Currencies, but nothing
      is a Currency unless explicitly defined as such by a rule.
----------------------------------------
Rule 611 (Mutable)
      Players may own any type of Currency.  No non-player Nomic
      entity may own Currencies except as provided for in the Rules.
      The number of each type of Currency owned by each player or
      other Nomic entity must be non-negative, and must be an integer.
      This rule applies to Currencies in general, and thus defers to
      rules for specific Currencies.
----------------------------------------
Rule 612 (Mutable)
      A Player is defined as the Recordkeepor for a Currency if e is
      required to keep an accurate record of the number of that
      Currency owned by each player and non-player Nomic entity which
      is permitted to own that Currency.
      The Recordkeepor for each type of Coin shall be the Vizier of
      the Group corresponding to that type of Coin.
      Other rules may establish Recordkeepors for other Currencies.
----------------------------------------
Rule 614 (Mutable)
      A player may voluntarily transfer any Currency to any other
      player for any purpose by sending such a message to the
      Recordkeepor for that Currency, within the following limits:
            a) a player may only transfer a positive number of
               a Currency
            b) a player may not transfer more of a Currency than e
               currently has.
      This rule applies to Currencies in general, and thus defers to
      rules for specific Currencies.
----------------------------------------
Rule 613 (Mutable)
      If a Currency exists and no rule (other than this one) exists
      which specifies a Recordkeepor for that Currency, then the
      Banker shall be the Recordkeepor for that Currency.
      This rule applies to Currencies in general, and thus defers to
      rules for specific Currencies.

========================================
Marks and the Banker
----------------------------------------
Rule 516 (Mutable)
      There shall be a new unit of currency known as Marks. Any Player
      may possess zero or more Marks, but not less than zero. Any
      Player may give any number of Marks to any other Player, as long
      as that Player will not possess less than zero Marks at the end
      of the trade. There shall also be an entity known as the Bank,
      which shall possess Marks exactly like a Player. There shall
      also be an Office known as the Banker. The Banker shall keep an
      accurate record of how many Marks each Player possesses, and how
      many Marks are possessed by the Bank.  The Banker shall recieve
      a salary of 3 Points after every seven days in Office.
----------------------------------------
Rule 803 (Mutable)
Quantum Marks--0.01
803.  Marks Granularity
      All Marks transfers between Game Entities must be in multiples
      of 0.01 Marks. Furthermore, whenever a quantity of Marks is
      changed, that quantity is immediately adjusted by rounding to
      the nearest .01 Mark.
      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which would permit a
      different granularity of Marks.
----------------------------------------
Rule 523 (Mutable)
      The Banker shall not reveal how many Marks are in any other
      Player's possession to any other Player, except as allowed for
      in the Rules.  The Banker shall reveal the number of Marks in
      the Bank to any Player who requests the information.
----------------------------------------
Rule 517 (Mutable)
      There shall be a limited number of Marks. No Marks shall be
      created or destroyed except as explicitly allowed for in
      legislation. If a Rule states that Marks are to be transfered,
      but there is no source for those Marks, then the Rule shall have
      no legal force. If the Rule does state a source for the Marks,
      but that source does not Possess enough Marks, then all the
      Marks possessed by the source shall be transfered, and the
      remainder of the Marks shall be transfered as the source
      receives them.
----------------------------------------
Rule 534 (Mutable)
      If a transfer indicated by the Rules is not made due to an
      insufficient number of Marks being possessed by the Entity which
      is losing Marks, the transfer shall be delayed as per other
      legislation. If a single Entity has more than one transfer which
      is being delayed for such a reason, these transfers shall be
      made in the order in which they became required by legislation.
----------------------------------------
Rule 518 (Mutable)
      Upon the passage of this Rule, 3 Marks shall be created for
      every Player in the Game, and given to those Players. If a new
      Player joins the Game, 3 Marks are created and given to that
      Player. If a Player leaves the Game, whatever Marks are in their
      possession are destroyed. If that same Player later joins the
      Game again, they shall not recieve any Marks.
----------------------------------------
Rule 533 (Mutable)
      If a Player wishes, e may buy Marks from the Bank. The Player
      must trade 25 Points to the Point Reserve. Then e shall send a
      message to the Banker notifying that Banker that such a Trade
      has been made for the purpose of buying Marks. When the Trade
      has been verified by the Banker, the above Player shall recieve
      1 Mark from the Bank.
----------------------------------------
Rule 824 (Mutable)
Buying Points with Marks
824.  Purchase of Points
      Let all Players be able to buy points with eir Marks from the
      Bank in a ratio of 20 points to 1 Mark.  Points will be received
      from the Point Reserve for such transactions.
      For such a transaction to be valid the Player must communicate
      to the Banker that a point purchase is desired.  The player must
      transfer only whole Mark amounts for such a transfer.  The
      Banker will inform the Scorekeepor of transfer and the amount of
      points the Player is to receive from the Point Reserve.  The
      Scorekeepor shall make the transaction public knowledge.
----------------------------------------
Rule 525 (Mutable)
      If a Player trades one Mark to the Bank, and trades 10 Points to
      the Point Reserve, then that Player may Lock another Player's
      Marks account for a period of five days. To do so, that Player
      must notify the Banker, who shall then notify the Player whose
      account has been Locked that the account has been locked, but
      not who has Locked it. If a Player's Marks account has been
      Locked, then that Player shall not trade Marks to any  other
      Player or to the Bank until his account is no longer Locked.
----------------------------------------
Rule 520 (Mutable)
      On Monday, at noon in the time zone in which the Banker resides,
      each Player shall be given 1 Points for every 2 Marks which they
      possess, rounded down.
----------------------------------------
Rule 736 (Mutable)
      Let there be the Patent Title known as "Marxist", which is
      awarded to the Player with the most Marks, or if tied, to the
      Players with the most Marks. Only the current richest Player
      or Players may hold this title.
      The determination and announcement of assignment and revoking
      of the Title is made by the Banker, who must use the most
      accurate means of determining this available to eim, and must
      make the announcement as soon as possible after becoming aware
      of a change in holder of the Title.
      However: To respect some Players' wish for privacy, and in
      view of the secret nature of Marks accounts, a prospective
      Marxist must first be asked if e wants the Title. If not, then
      instead of announcing, "Player x is granted the Patent Title of
      'Marxist', e announces, "Patent Title of 'Marxist' is granted
       to an anonymous Player".

Rule 758 (Mutable)
      When, for any reason, the owner of a Nomic entity is to be
      determined by an Auction, this Auction shall be conducted by an
      Auctioneer, who shall be the Banker, the Banker's chosen willing
      delegate, or any other player as specified in other rules.
      Once the identity of the Auctioneer is determined, the Auction
      begins with the Auctioneer making an announcement to the game
      forum stating what  Nomic entity is up for Auction, and that e
      is accepting bids.
      Players who wish to participate in the Auction then must
      indicate their interest by sending a bid to the Auctioneer.
      The list of players who have indicated an interest is not
      secret, and if it is not included as part of the Auctioneer's
      Announcements the Auctioneer must share it on demand.

Destroy the Walrus Marks
864.  Destroy the Walrus Marks
      Any Marks created through the passage of the Walrus Rules (Rules

      been converted into points, those points earned shall be
      returned to the Point Reserve.

Rule 931 (Mutable)
Stocks
931.  Cure 725
      Let there be for each Player one Currency called X Stock,
      where X is the name of the Player.
      The Dividend on Stock X shall be 2 Points or 5% of the Points of
      Player X on Friday Noon GMT (whatever is more).
      The Dividend shall be transfered on Friday Noon GMT to the
      Player (or Players) who holds Stock X.
      At the passing of this Proposal the Bank has possession of all
      Stocks.  During the following week the Banker shall collect the
      bids in Marks.  Those bids have to be made by the Players
      (either alone or acting together on the same Stock) in a message
      to the server.  No bid shall be made, which can not be covered
      by the Marks in  he bidders Bank account (to be verified by the
      Banker.)
      After one week each of the Stocks shall be transfered from the
      Bank to the highest bidder. If two or more bids for Stock X are
      exactly equal, the Stock shall go to player X (if one of the
      highest bidders), or to the Player with the lowest score.
      If a given Stock X is bought by Player X, the Marks of the bid
      shall be transfered from Player X to the Bank.
      If a given Stock X is bought by another Player (or Players) then
      Player X, the Marks of the bid shall go from this Player(s) to
      Player X.
      The Banker shall keep track of the Stocks held by each Player.

----------------------------------------
Rule 731 (Mutable)
      When there exists no Stock for Player X, one shall be created
      and sold for Marks in an Auction, with the Banker as Auctioneer.
      The proceedings shall go to Player X, unless they obtain their
      own Stock, in which case the proceedings shall go to the Bank.
----------------------------------------
Rule 728 (Mutable)
      When Player X leaves the game, Stock X shall be destroyed.
      If Stock X was held at that time by another Player, this Player
      shall be compensated with half the price in Marks that this
      Player paid for the Stock X.
      These Marks shall come from the account of Player X, *before*
      those shall be destroyed, as required by other Rules.
      If there are not enough Marks available, the deficit shall be
      paid by the Bank.
      This Rule applies to the Stock of Players that have left the

      by that Player for eis Stocks.  The Marks for a given Stock
      shall be drawn from the account of the Player to which the Stock
      corresponds.
      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules governing ownership
      of Stocks.

========================================
Winning a Game, and the End of a Game
----------------------------------------
Rule 112 (Immutable)
      The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered
      from achieving n points to any other state of affairs.  The
      magnitude of n and the means of earning points may be changed,
      and Rules that establish a Winner when play cannot continue may
      be Enacted and (while they are mutable) be Amended or Repealed.
----------------------------------------
Rule 724 (Mutable)
      The Winner is the first Voter to achieve sufficiently many
      Points.  The minimum number of Points required for Player X to
      win is 10*N*(1+G/6), where N is the number of Players currently
      registered in the Game, and G is the number of Games which
      Player X has already won.  If more than one Voter achieves this
      condition simultaneously, then all such Voters win.  When a Game
      ends in this manner:
        - If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the new
          Speaker and the old Speaker becomes a Voter.
        - If there is more than one Winner, the Voter with the highest Point
          total becomes the new Speaker.  If more than one Voter is
          tied for the highest score, the old Speaker randomly selects
          one of them to become the new Speaker.  The old Speaker
          becomes a voter.
        - All Player's scores are reset to 0.
        - A new Game is begun.  All Rules and Proposals retain the
          status they had at the end of the old Game.
----------------------------------------
Rule 413 (Mutable)
      If the Rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or
      if the legality of some action cannot be determined with
      finality, or if some action appears equally legal and illegal,
      then a player may Call For Judgement on a Statement to that
      effect.  If the Statement is judged TRUE, then the same Judge
      who judged the Statement TRUE must declare the most recent
      passed Proposal X such that the Statement was not TRUE before
      the passage of Proposal X, or declare that there is no such
      Proposal.  (Until the Judge does this, the Judgment is not
      valid.)  If the Judgement of TRUE is not overruled, then the
      Player who called for Judgement is declared the Winner of the
      game.
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared that
      there is no such Proposal X, the game is ended, with no
      provisions for restarting it.
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared such
      a Proposal X, the following actions are taken:
         - all Players remain active,
         - all Proposals curently being Voted upon are removed from
           consideration for Voting,
         - the scores for all Players are set to 0 (zero),
         - the Rules and explicit game custom are reverted to the
           state they were in before Proposal X was passed,
         - a Benevolent Speaker for the next Game is chosen:
              -If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the
               Benevolent Speaker, and the old Benevolent Speaker
               becomes a Voter,
              -If there is more than one Winner, the Benevolent
               Speaker randomly selects one of the Winners, who
               becomes the new Benevolent Speaker, and the old
               Benevolent Speaker becomes a Voter,
         - and a new Game is begun.

Rule 755 (Mutable)
      Let there be known the Patent Title known as Champion. This
      Patent Title shall be given to every Player who Wins a Game of
      eNomic, or who has Won a Game of eNomic. This Patent Title shall
      be awarded automatically, without need for a Proposal.
      If a Player Wins a Game despite a handicap factor X, then that
      Player shall instead receive the Patent Title "Champion*X",
      substituting for X the ratio of the Points required for that
      Player to Win, over the Points required for an unhandicapped
      Player to Win.

Rule 388 (Mutable)
      Whenever a new game of Nomic is begun, the status of the new
      Game when it begins shall be the same as the status of the old
      Game when it ended, in all respects where the Rules do not
      decide otherwise.
----------------------------------------
Rule 684 (Mutable)
      At the end of each Game the Point Reserve is reset to X.  Let X
      be equal to the total number of Points that exists in the Point
      Reserve at the end of the Game divided by the number of Active
      Players that were Active at the end of the Game.

Rule 823 (Mutable)
Marks to Points at Game End
823.  Marks Conversions
      At the end of each game let each Player that did not win have
      eir points be converted to Marks in a ratio of 50 points to 1
      Mark.  The winner's points shall be taken away and e shall not
      receive any Mark's compensation for eis points.
      Marks for these conversions shall be awarded from the bank as
      directed by the Ruleset

Changing Speakers
----------------------------------------
Rule 640 (Mutable)
      If for any reason, the post of Speaker becomes vacant during a
      Game, it will be filled in the same way as a vacant Office.
----------------------------------------
Rule 785 (Mutable)
      If the Speaker has abandoned eir post, another new, Temporary
      Speaker is selected according to the "Rules of Succession", or
      if no such rules are defined, the other Player not on hold with
      the highest Score becomes the temporary Speaker.  This does not
      force the Game to be over in this case, and Scores are not reset
      to 0. The Game continues until a Player Wins, at which time a
      new Game is begun and the Winner becomes the real Speaker. The
      Temporary Speaker shall make reasonable effort to obtain the
      former Speaker's materials: proposal queue, voting records, etc.
      but if this is not possible, then the Temporary Speaker shall
      request that these be resubmitted by the Players. If a Speaker
      is replaced in this manner, e has eir score set to minus 2N
      Points immediately, where N is the number of Points required for
      a Player to Win the Game.
      Abandonment is determined as follows: If any Player suspects
      that the Speaker has Abandoned, e sends a message to all Players
      calling on the Speaker to announce eir presence.  The Speaker
      must reply to all Players within one week; if e does not, e is
      considered to have Abandoned.
      (*Was: 677*)
----------------------------------------
Rule 681 (Mutable)
      A Speaker may voluntarily give up Speakership, by announcing the
      fact to all Players and proceeding according to other Rules
      governing the orderly transfer of power of a Speaker. The
      Speaker is replaced by a temporary Speaker according to the
      Rules of Succession. The Game is not over in this case, and
      Scores are not reset to 0. The Game continues until a Player
      Wins, at which time a new Game is begin and the Winner becomes
      the real Speaker.
      Restrictions: The ex-Speaker loses 10 Points immediately, and if
      the resulting Score is greater than the average Score of all
      Players, then eir score is set to the average Score.
----------------------------------------
Rule 786 (Mutable)
      When a Speaker is to be replaced according to the "Rules of
      Succession", that order is defined to be:
      Archivist
      Clerk of the Courts
      Rulekeepor
      Distributor
      <all other Officers in descending Point order>
      <all other Voters in descending Point order>
      When a replacement Speaker is required, all Players who are
      willing to become Speaker shall indicate such in a message, sent
      within three days of the Abandonment or resignation of the
      Speaker.  The old Speaker may not send such a message.  This
      message shall be sent to the Speaker, in the case of a Speaker
      voluntarily giving up his position; or to the first Player who
      called for the Speaker to announce his presence, in the case of
      an Abandoned Speaker.
      After three days, the Player ranking highest on the list
      of succession, out of those who indicated a willingness to
      become Speaker, shall become Speaker.
      (*Was: 680*)
----------------------------------------
Rule 402 (Mutable)
      When one Mighty Speaker is yielding his Office to another, the
      following procedure shall be followed:
       1) The Present Mighty Speaker shall forward copies of all
          necessary materials for the performance of his Office to the
          Prospective Mighty Speaker.
       2) The Prospective Mighty Speaker shall acknowledge the receipt
          of said materials.
       3) The Present Mighty Speaker shall post a message to the
          listserv announcing the official transfer of power, which
          occurs at the "Date:" of the Present Mighty Speaker's
          posting.
      The Present Mighty Speaker remains in Office until the successful
      completion of step 3.
----------------------------------------
Rule 679 (Mutable)
      If a Player is selected to perform the role of Temporary
      Speaker, and e accepts, then e shall be compensated exactly as
      the Speaker would have been at the end of the Game, instead of
      the Speaker, who is not compensated. This Rule takes precedence
      over other Rules which would provide a reward to the Speaker
      at the end of the Game.
----------------------------------------
Rule 942 (Mutable)
Replacement of Impossible Speaker
942.  Replacement of Impossible Speaker
      If a Speaker is determined by CFJ to have made further play
      impossible by eir actions or lack thereof, and the CFJ is not
      appealed within the allowed time, then a new Speaker is selected
      according to the "Rules of Succession", or if no such rules are
      defined, the other Player not on hold with the highest Score
      becomes the Speaker.  This does not force the Game to be over in
      this case, and Scores are not reset to 0. The Game continues
      until a Player Wins, at which time a new Game is begun and the
      Winner becomes the Speaker. The new Speaker shall make
      reasonable effort to obtain the former Speaker's materials:
      proposal queue, voting records, etc., but if this is not
      possible, then the new Speaker shall request that these be
      resubmitted by the Players. If a Speaker is replaced in this
      manner, e has eir score set to minus 2N Points immediately,
      where N is the number of Points required for a Player to Win the
      Game; this is the Scorekeepor's responsibility.
      "Impossible" is defined here to mean overwhelmingly psychotic
      behavior, a complete lack of interest in the Game, or
      uncooperativeness of the highest order. It does *not* include
      normal Speaker latitudes which have been taken by past Speakers
      for various reasons, whether justifiable or not, including but
      not limited to: temporary suspension of proposal distribution,
      resetting of scores, or the commission of Crimes or accidental
      illegal actions. The Judge of the CFJ *must* take these
      extremely tight standards into account, and the accused Speaker
      *must* be given an opportunity to defend eirself.
      This Rule adds to the set of valid classes of Judgements, and
      takes precedence over other Rules which may attempt to prevent
      this class of Judgement.
----------------------------------------
========================================
Groups
----------------------------------------
Rule 766 (Mutable)
      A Group is initially formed by a set of Players which has
      registered with the Registrar to form a Group; other Players may
      join later.  Each Group has a Name, a Membership, a Vizier,
      an Ordinancekeepor, a Treasury, an Initial Set of Ordinances,
      and an associated form of Currency, called the <name> Coins,
      where <name> is the Name of the Group.
      1.  The Name may not be the Name of another Group.
      2.  The Membership is a set of Players;  these Players are
      Members of the Group, and all other Players are not.
      3.  Synchronously with the registration of a Group, two Offices
      are created known as the <name> Vizier, and the <name>
      Ordinancekeepor, where <name> is the Name of the Group.
      These Offices may never be empty, and the <name> Vizier and
      <name> Ordinancekeepor must both be a member of <name> Group.
      The <name> Vizier shall inform the Registrar whenever the
      Membership or the Ordinancekeepor of the <name> group changes.
      When the <name> Vizier changes, the new Vizier shall inform the
      Registrar of the change.
      The <name> Ordinancekeepor shall keep an accurate and current
      record of the Ordinances of the <name> Group.
      4.  The Treasury is a repository for Points and Currencies and
      has the same capabilities for holding, trading, and spending
      Points and Currencies as does a Player.
      5.  The Ordinances are a description of the operation of the
      Group.
      6.  The <name> Coins are a form of Currency which is created
      synchronously with the registration of the Group.  The <name>
      Group may create <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be
      placed in the <name> Treasury.  The <name> Group may destroy
      <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be removed from the
      <name> Treasury.
      (*Was: 714*)
----------------------------------------
Rule 715 (Mutable)
      The Registrar shall keep a record of all currently formed
      Groups, their Memberships, Viziers, and Ordinancekeepors; as
      well as a record of all unaffiliated Players; and such other
      data as are required in order to make the Group Report.
----------------------------------------
Rule 717 (Mutable)
      Not less than once each Nomic Week, the Registrar must post the
      Group Report in the Public Forum.  This report shall
      contain:
      1.  A list of unaffiliated Players;
      2.  A list of currently formed Groups, and for each Group the
      following information:
          (a) the Name of the Group;
          (b) the Vizier of the Group;
          (c) the Ordinancekeepor of the Group; and
          (d) the Membership of the Group.
----------------------------------------
Rule 716 (Mutable)
      A Group shall be registered with the Registrar under the
      following conditions.  At least three Players in a certain
      subset X of the set of active Players must each send the
      Registrar a message (known as the Application) containing a list
      of the set X of Players, all of whom must be unaffiliated with
      any other Group; and a name for the proposed Group.  The
      Application may also contain an Initial Set of Ordinances
      for the Group.
      When the Registrar receives Applications from three Players in
      X, having identical information (as described above), all within
      a week of each other, than the Group shall be registered, with
      the given Name and Initial Set of Ordinances (if one was
      included), and the three Players who sent Applications as
      Members of that Group.  The Registrar shall then post in the
      Public Forum that the Group has been formed, along with its Name
      and Membership.
----------------------------------------
Rule 719 (Mutable)
      A Player not affiliated with any Group may become a Member of a
      Group at any time after Registration of the Group only as
      specified in that Group's Ordinances, so long as they do not
      conflict with the rules.  However, other rules may establish
      other restrictions on Group Membership, and no Player shall
      become a Member of a Group without eir sending such a request to
      the Vizier of that Group.
      A Player may never be a Member of more than one Group.
----------------------------------------
Rule 721 (Mutable)
      All Members of a Group must obey the Ordinances of that Group at
      all times, so long as the Ordinances do not conflict with the
      Rules.
      The Ordinances of a Group may specify:
      1.   how the Ordinances of that Group may be changed, or that
      they may not be changed.  If the Ordinances do not so specify,
      then the Ordinances shall be changed only upon unanimous
      agreement of all Members of that Group.
      2.  the Vizier of the Group, so long as the Vizier is a Member
      of that Group.  If the Ordinances of a Group do not so specify,
      the Vizier shall be the Player whose Application for that Group
      was received first by the Registrar, if e is still a Member of
      that Group.
      3.  the Ordinancekeepor of the Group, so long as the
      Ordinancekeepor is a Member of that Group.  If the Ordinances do
      not so specify, then the Vizier of that Group shall also be its
      Ordinancekeepor.
      4.  How the Points or Currencies in the Group's Treasury shall
      be spent, so long as it does not conflict with the Rules.  A
      Group may spend Points or Currencies in the same manner as a
      Player.  When Points or Currencies are to be spent from the
      Group's Treasury, the Vizier of that Group shall inform the
      Scorekeepor or Recordkeepor for the Currency, as is appropriate.
----------------------------------------
Rule 767 (Mutable)
      If a Group has N Members then it has N Votes for each
      Proposal in addition to those of its Membership.  The
      Ordinances of a Group may determine how and when the Group
      casts its Votes; if the Ordinances are silent on this issue
      then the Group may not cast its Votes.  The Votes of the
      Group are cast when the Vizier sends a message to the Speaker
      to that effect during the Voting Period and this action is
      legitimate insofar as the Ordinances are concerned.
      (*Was: 646*)
----------------------------------------
Rule 764 (Mutable)
      Any Player or Group X may perform an Act of Mischief directed
      at any Player or Group Y.  The permissible forms of Mischief
      are defined in other Rules; such definitions must include a
      positive Price in Coins, or the form of Mischief is not
      permissible.  This Rule explicitly takes precedence over all
      other Rules which purport to determine which forms of Mischief
      are permissible.
      To cause an Act of Mischief,  X  sends to the Public Forum a
      message containing:
      - the Name of the object, Y;
      - the effect of the Act of Mischief;
      - the Number of the Rule which permits the form of Mischief;
      - indication of which Coins in X's account will be used as
      payment for the Act of Mischief.  Coins of Group Y, or the
      Group to which Player Y belongs, may not be used as payment.
      The effect of the Act of Mischief is applied immediately upon
      publication of the above message in the Forum.  An additional
      effect of this Act of Mischief is that
      - for each Coin of Group Z spent as payment above, two Points
      are removed from the Z Treasury;
      - the Coins used as payment above are removed from X's account
      and destroyed.
----------------------------------------
Rule 718 (Mutable)
      A player may resign from a Group of which e is a Member, at any
      time, by sending such a message to the Registrar and the Vizier
      of that Group.  This rule takes precedence over all other rules
      concerning Groups.
----------------------------------------
Rule 762 (Mutable)
      If, for any reason, Player X ceases to be a Member of Group Y,
      then Player X shall recieve a share of the contents of the Y
      Treasury as specified in the Y Ordinances.  If the Y Ordinances
      are silent on this issue, or if Group Y has ceased to exist,
      then 1/N times the contents of the Y Treasury, rounded
      downwards, shall be transferred to Player X, where N is the
      number of Members of Group Y immediately before Player X ceased
      to be a Member of Group Y.  This transfer is not taxable, and
      may incude a negative number of Points.  This Rule takes
      precedence over all other Rules which determine which Point and
      Currency transfers are legal and/or taxable.
----------------------------------------
Rule 763 (Mutable)
      If at any time a Group X has fewer than three members, or Group
      X does not have a Vizier, then Group X shall cease to exist.
      Immediately before Group X ceases to exist, a number of Points
      equal to two times the number of X Coins in existence at that
      moment shall be removed from the X Treasury, and then all of
      the X Coins shall be converted to Points, at the rate of two
      Points per Coin.
      (*Was: 720*)
----------------------------------------
========================================
The Sweepstakes Officer and the Lottery
----------------------------------------
Rule 655 (Mutable)
      There shall be an Office known as the Sweepstakes Officer. The
      Sweepstakes Officer shall be responsible for the weekly Lottery
      and for the secret Word Sweepstakes, as well as any other duties
      which are determined by future legislation. The Sweepstakes
      Officer shall receive 2 Points at the end of each seven days of
      holding Office, starting from the date which e took Office. The
      Sweepstakes Officer shall be chosen as defined in other
      legislation.
----------------------------------------
Rule 749 (Mutable)
      Every time a Voter proposes a Proposal, that Voter shall gain
      one Entry into a weekly Lottery. Each week, a random Entry shall
      be selected by the designated Sweepstakes Officer, and the Voter
      who owns that Entry shall receive 1 Point per Entry by any other
      Player into the Lottery. For purposes of this Rule, a week
      shall begin on Monday at 12:00 am and shall last seven days,
      until Sunday at 11:59 pm, in the time zone in which the
      designated Sweepstakes Officer resides. The weekly drawing
      shall take place as soon as possible after the end of the week.

PROTO-PROPOSALS : Consolidation of Proposal rules.
These are the proto-proposals for rules collation, first posted on 20/7/94.

I need some feedback on these.

Proto-PROPOSAL:  Collation of Proposal Rules.
see below for new complete text of rule 884


Next are a set of repeals for those rules that have been moved together.

(Repeals a Rule)
"      659

PROPOSAL: Repeal for Collation 7
(Reepeals a Rule)
"      891



Rule 884 (Mutable)

A) There shall be a standard format for Proposals.

B) The word "PROPOSAL: " must be written at the top of the document.

C) The word "PROPOSAL:" shall be followed a title, which does not form 
part of the Proposal itself, and therefore does not form part of any
rule enacted or ammended by the proposal.

D) The line immediately below that on which is written the title there shall 
be a Declaration, describing the effect that the rule change
will have upon the Rule Set.  The Declaration will be a short phrase in 
parantheses, from the following list:

         (Creates a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes a new
         Rule to come into existence.
		The body of a proposal following this declaration must be the 
		finished form of the new rule.   
         (Amends a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes an
         existing Rule to change wording or form.
		The body of a proposal following this must contain the 
		number of the rule to be ammended.  It must either contain
		the entire wording of the rule, following its ammendment,
		or quote any portions of the rule to be removed, or words
		to be included.  It must include the position of any addition
		in the text of the ammended rule. 
	 (Repeals a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes an
         existing Rule to cease to exist.
		The body of the proposal must include the number of the 
		rule to be removed from the Set.       
	 (Transmutes a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes a
         Mutable Rule to become Immutable, or vice versa.
		The body after this phrase must contain the number of the 
		rule to be transmuted. 
         (Non-Rules Change: x) or (NRC: x) shall be used when the proposal 
	    seeks to alter the current state of the game, but not of the
	    rules.  The Award of a Patent Title, already described in
	    legislation, is an example of this, where the Declaration
	    would be: (NRC: Award of a Patent Title).  Only phrases 
	    defined in other legislation may be used a substitutes for x.
		The number of the rule which defines the NRC phrase must 
		be included in the body of the proposal.
	 (Other) shall be used if no other Declaration has been
            defined which describes the Proposal.
		The number of the rule affected by this declaration must
		be included in the body of the proposal.

 
      Additional legislation may not define additional legal Declarations
      or change the presentation of the Declaration, save through the 
      ammendment of this Rule.  Additional legislation may, however, 
      define N-RC phraes, without ammending this rule. 

F)    The proposal must conclude with the name of the Proposer.

G)    Failure to include the term PROPOSAL:, the name of the 
      Proposer, or a required Rule Number makes the proposal invalid.  

H)      Failure to format correctly is a criminal offence:
        Format Deviation:              Level of Offence:  
        Absence of Title:                               B               
        Absence of Declaration:                         C
        Use of a declaration not defined in this Rule:  A
        Use of an Undefined NRC phrase:                 D         
        Misordering of required Proposal elements       D

I)	Any proposal which has more than 70 characters on a single line, 
	or more than 25 lines, requires a processing fee of two points, 
	to be paid to the Point Reserve.

J)	The brevity of a proposal of 10 or fewer lines is rewarded with
	a point from the Point Reserve, if it passes.  Those lines which
	are blank, or solely contain legally required information, do not
	accrue toward this total. 

End of proto-proposals,
On to cpmmentary:

What do you all think?

NOTE THAT, USING THIS FORM, YOU COULD AMMEND 884 TO CHANGE TWO OR MORE 
SUBRULES SIMULATNEOUSLY.  YOU COULD AMMEND B) AND J) IN A SINGLE 
PROPOSAL, FOR INSTANCE.  THERE IS NO REFERENCE IN THE RULES TO SUBRULES, 
SO REFERING TO 884J IN THE DECLARATION IS ILLEGAL, BUT THEY CAN BE USED 
IN THE BODY.

THIS IS THEREFORE A DE FACTO, AND DE JURE SECTION.  USING THIS FORMAT 
TECHNIQUE MAKES NEW RULES DEFINING SECTIONS UNNECESSARY.

I think that I deserve a Patent Title for all of this: "Collator", "Grim 
Repealer?" or something else.

Why do the Abellards never post to me?  Is it some sort of secret society?

Timothy.

Some obvious corrections, then two new Lotteries.
Finally by three ideas to make Marks worth something.

Given that the Conservative, Headstrong And Silent
Majority (CHASM) always opposes such ideas, I would like to have
some positive feedback on this, before wasting Points on it.

By the way, all this talk about abolishing Marks confuses me: Marks
were created to make points last a little bit longer than just a
Game, *so that a living economy could be possible*.
Do we really want to abolish that, without even started the economy.

(Apart from Stocks, which I think was a genial invention.
But let's stay modest....)

====
Proto-PROPOSAL     (Stella?)
Default Rules for Officers
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 881 to read:

An Officer is any Player who has been Appointed or Elected to
an Office specified in the Rules. A Judge is not an Officer.
An Officer may be replaced by another Player if a Proposal to
that effect passes.
An Officer may resign at any time, provided e appoints a
consenting successor.
If an Officer resigns while a Proposal is being voted upon to
replace eim, the Player proposed will by eis Successor.

This Rule applies to general Offices, and therefore defers to
Rules for specific Offices.
      (*Was: 733*)
[Adds the word `consenting'. This assures that the Office
goes to somebody, who not immediately returns the favour.]

====
Proto-PROPOSAL     (Stella?)
Default Salaries of Officers
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 849 to read:
Officers (excluding Viziers, Ordinancekeepors, and any other
Officers whose duties pertain only to a single Group) shall
receive a salary of 3 Points per week, unless another Rule
explicitly states another salary.

The salary shall be paid at the beginning of each Nomic week,
on condition that the Officer has been in Office for at least
five days.

The second paragraph of this Rule takes precedence over all
Rules that determine payday differently.

[Officializes something I have been putting in practice already:
all salaries are paid on Monday. (Sue me if you disagree!)
This is more practical than having different paydays for all Officers.]

====
Proto-PROPOSAL     (Stella?)
Mark Lottery
(Creates a Rule)

As soon as possible after the beginning of the Nomic Week, the
Sweepstake Officer shall hold and publish The Agora Nomic
Mark Handout. E shall randomly select three different Active
Players. These Players shall receive 3, 2 and 1 Mark respectively,
which Marks shall be created.

The Scorekeepor shall transfer 1 Point from all Active Players
to the Point Reserve, at the beginning of the Nomic Week.

[Trying to make Marks Roll.
Maybe it's more logical to make a Mark transfer (say 0.1 Marks)
instead, but I didn't want to bother the Banker with more work,
if I can do it myself!]

====
Proto-PROPOSAL     (Stella?)
Stock Lottery
(Creates a Rule)

As soon as possible after the beginning of the Nomic Week, the
Sweepstake Officer shall hold and publish The Agora Nomic
Stock Swap. E shall randomly select a Player and a Stock.
The chosen Stock shall be transfered without payment, from the
Player who holds the Stock to the selected Player.

This Rule takes precedence over any Rule requiring the transfer
of a Stock to be accompagnied by a payment.

[Holding Stock in Real Life is a risky business.
In Agora it isn't: this Rule changes that.
Secondly, it helps in getting Stocks flowing and available to
`poor' Players.]

===
Proto-PROPOSAL     (Stella?)
Discourages Too Many Proposals
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 936 to read:
When a player submits a Proposal to the Speaker, e shall lose 1
point for each Proposal proposed by em which either is currently
up for Vote, or has been sent to the Speaker but not yet
distributed.

The Speaker is responsible for reporting this point change to
the Scorekeepor, and the Speaker shall report it no later than
the time at which the proposal is distributed.

For the purposes of this Rule, multiple proposals in the same
message shall be considered to have been sent to the Speaker
separated by infinitesimal increments of time.

The point change shall not be applied to Players who have made
a Public Mark transfer of 0.5 Marks to the Bank on the same day
has the proposals are submitted, while stating the reason of the
transfer. The occurence of such a transfer shall be mentioned to
the Speaker in the message submitting the Proposals.
      (*Was: 843*)

[Took out the confusing reference to the non-existing Point Sucker.
More important: first idea to give Marks value.
Lastly: 936 really frustrates me. I have about five proposal ideas
per day. (And they all come when I drive home in the evening!)]

===
Proto-PROPOSAL     (Stella?)
Selecting a Judge
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 890 to read:
Upon receipt of a Call For Judgement (CFJ), the Clerk of the
Courts (CotC) shall randomly appoint an Ordained Player to be Judge
excluding those on hold, calling for judgement, whose move is
under judgement in said CFJ, or have declined appointment on
this CFJ.

A Player becomes Ordained for the rest of a Game in progress
by making a Public Mark transfer of 0.5 Marks to the Bank sometime
during the Game, while stating the reason for the transfer.

Players may decline to serve on a particular case by notifying
the CotC within 72 hours of appointment.  The declining Player
shall not be eligible to serve as Judge for this CFJ and shall
also lose two points, one of which shall be given to the CotC.

Upon receiving notice of a Player declining to serve the CotC
shall randomly appoint a new Judge from the eligible Ordained
Players.
      (*Was: 647/793*)

[Second idea to make Marks worth something.]

===
Proto-PROPOSAL     (Stella?)
Conditional salary
(Creates a Rule)

An Officer shall only receive the salary determined by other
if e made a Public transfer of 0.5 Marks to the Bank in the 72 hours
following eir appointment.

[Third idea to make Marks worth something.]

NOTE:  I am basing entries into the Proposal Lottery on Proposals 
OFFicially submitted to the Players for Voting by the Mighty Speaker, as 
of the timestamp on the Mighty Speaker's message.  If people would prefer 
to have it based on when the proposal are *actually* submitted, that is 
fine with me, but I currently have insufficient data to do so.  If you 
want it done that way, I need one of two things:

	a) a list of people who have submitted proposals in a given week 
	from the Mighty Speaker; or

	b) for *everyone* who submits a proposal to the Mighty Speaker 
	to CC: me a copy, which I will use as a basis for that proposal's
	entry in the Lottery.  Please note that, if I go to this method, I
	am not going to check the entries against the Mighty Speaker's
	voting messages; I will count ONLY CCs of OFFicial porposal
	submissions as entries. 

Let me know what people want; I'll adjust based on the majority's wishes.

Greetings!

On 6/30, Judge Coren (me), whilst pontificating in CFJ 158,  issued an 
injunction calling for a Formal Apology from Ninny Stella?.

On 7/5, Judge Fnord, in CFJ 160, wrote the following:

"While an Active Ninny is required to post eis Formal Apology within 72
hours of the posting of the Injunction that obliges eim so,
this time limit does not apply to Ninnies On Hold" is therefore judged
TRUE.
 
The time limit specified in Rule 908 therefore does not apply to a Ninny
while e is on hold."

I note that, even if one does not count the time before going On Hold but 
after the issuing of the Injunction, Ninny Stella has been Off Hold for 
more than 72 hours, and has not issued his formal apology.

Also, something I have not yet checked:  was r463 annotated as per point 
#3 of the Injunction in CFJ 158?  Mr. Scorekeepor?

The pertinent CFJs follow.

Former Judge Coren

==========

Call For Judgement 158

The Judge is        Coren

Caller:             KoJen
Date:               Wed, 29 Jun 94 08:56:39 -0400

Barred Players:     Stella?

Judge:              Coren
Date Assigned:      Wed Jun 29 13:45:31 EDT 1994
Date Judged:        Thu, 30 Jun 1994 11:36:34 PDT

The Judgement:      TRUE

Scorekeepor:        Player Coren receives 5 points for Speedy
                    Judgement.

Notes from the Caller:
    I wish to bar Stella? from judging. I wish to advise the Judge
    that, should this be judged True, an injunction is required. This
    injunction should include any necessary adjustments to the Scores,
    and a requirement for a formal apology by the Scorekeepor.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Statement

Scorekeepor Stella? violated Rules for Scorekeeping when he took it upon
himself to second-guess the accurate report by the Banker of KoJen's Marks
Interest. 

Arguments:

Banker Bowen reported the following for 6/27/94:

>        KoJen          +  1

Scorekeepor Stella? said:

> -KoJen's Mark interest was reported as 1 Point. This must be wrong
> and I changed it back to 21. By the way KoJen is in the lead with
> 96 Points, 63 of which game from Mark Interests.

Very generous of Stella?, but he is not allowed to do that, by the following
Rules: 

>From 901:

      The Scorekeepor is chiefly a tabulator of Point changes posted
      by others. E is only Legally Responsible for tabulating those
      classes of Point changes where Rules specifically bestow Legal
      Responsibility upon the Scorekeepor.

>From 906:

      The Legal Responsibility for detecting the following classes of
      Point changes and reporting them to the Scorekeepor is bestowed
      upon another Player:

      * Marks interest: responsibility of Banker to nofify Scorekeepor
      as soon as possible following the mandated interst payment.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
 
The Judgement:

I judge this statement to be TRUE, for the following reasons:

	1)  Rule 901 specifies that the Scorekeepor "...is only Legally 
	    Responsible for tabulating those classes of Point changes where
	    Rules specifically bestow Legal Responsibility upon the
	    Scorekeepor." 

	2)  Rule 906 specifies that Point ChangesUE, then the
      Judge must issue an Injunction that the Ninny submit a Formal
      Apology.  This Injunction may also include a list of up to ten
      Prescribed Words.  By a Formal Apology is meant a letter of at
      least 200 words, containing all of the Prescribed Words,
      explaining the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
      for self-improvement, and posted in the Public Forum within 72
      hours of the posting of the Injunction to the Public Forum.
      If the Ninny fails to meet these criteria e shall lose 10
      points.  Within 72 hours of the posting of this Formal Apology,
      the Squealer must either submit a Proposal that the Ninny's
      Apology be accepted, or submit a Proposal that the Ninny's
      Aplology be rejected, but not both.  No other Player may submit
      such a Proposal, and the Squealer may submit only one.  If a
      Proposal to accept the Apology fails, or if a Proposal to reject
      the Apology passes, then the Ninny loses 5 Points.
      (*Was: 781*)

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Judgement:

The Judgement: TRUE
 
Reasons and Arguments: As Stella? argued, according to Rule 212, Rule 870 
takes precedence over Rule 908.
 
Rule 212 (Mutable)
 
      If two or more Mutable Rules conflict with one another, or if
      two or more Immutable Rules conflict with one another, then the
      Rule with the lowest ordinal Number takes precedence.
        If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of rule) or takes
      precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.
        If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.
 
Again as Stella? claims, if e were an Active Player, e would be required
to post a formal apology.
 
908.  Time Requirement for Formal Apologies
 
      If a Player (herein called the Squealer) makes a Call For
      Judgement alleging that a Player (herein called the Ninny) has
      acted or has failed to act in such a way as to be in violation
      of one or more Rules, and this CFJ is Judged TRUE, then the
      Judge must issue an Injunction that the Ninny submit a Formal
      Apology.  This Injunction may also include a list of up to ten
      Prescribed Words.  By a Formal Apology is meant a letter of at
      least 200 words, containing all of the Prescribed Words,
      explaining the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
      for self-improvement, and posted in the Public Forum within 72
      hours of the posting of the Injunction to the Public Forum.
      If the Ninny fails to meet these criteria e shall lose 10
      points.  Within 72 hours of the posting of this Formal Apology,
      the Squealer must either submit a Proposal that the Ninny's
      Apology be accepted, or submit a Proposal that the Ninny's
      Aplology be rejected, but not both.  No other Player may submit
      such a Proposal, and the Squealer may submit only one.  If a
      Proposal to accept the Apology fails, or if a Proposal to reject
      the Apology passes, then the Ninny loses 5 Points.
      (*Was: 781*)
 
No mention is made in this Rule, or in Rule 663 governing Injunctions,
 
Rule 663 (Mutable)
 
      There shall be an entity known as an Injunction, which may
      accompany certain Judgements of TRUE or FALSE as provided in the
      rules. An Injunction is a statement or series of statements
      specifying an action or actions which must take place. If a
      Judgement is is accompanied by an Injunction, that Injunction
      must be published with the Judgement. All players must abide by
      the Injunction beginning no later than 72 hours after its
      publication unless one of the following conditions then apply:
        - The Judgement which the Injunction accompanies is undergoing
          appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of the appeal
          process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but a proposal
          has been published which would overturn that decision if
          passed, and said proposal has not failed.
        - The validity of the Injunction itself is questioned by a
          pending CFJ.
        - A Judgement upholding the validity of the Injunction is
          undergoing appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of
          the appeal process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but
          a proposal has been published which would overturn that
          decision if passed, and said proposal has not failed.
 
      A Judgement may not be accompanied by an Injunction unless it is
      specifically permitted elsewhere in the rules. An Injunction
      must be completely consistent with all rules in effect at the
      time of issuance, and must be completely relevant to the matter
      addressed in the corresponding judgement.
 
      If any Player believes that an Injunction or any part of it does
      not meet the criteria for a valid Injunction, e may submit a CFJ
      to that effect. If the resulting Judgement supports the
      contention that the criteria are not met, the Injunction shall
      be considered illegal and shall have no legal force.
 
      This rule takes precedence over all rules governing Injunctions.
 
or any other Rule, about how Injunctions and Rule 908 apply to players 
On Hold, so Rule 870 must govern in this case:
 
870.  Putting Oneself On Hold
 
      A Player may choose to be placed On Hold at any time by
      notifying the Speaker of the fact. The Speaker shall then
      notify all other Players.  If a Player wishes to cease being On
      Hold, that Player shall notify the Speaker of the fact. The
      Speaker shall then notify all other Players.  A Player may not
      be On Hold for less than 96 consecutive hours.
 
      While On Hold, a Player may not Vote, propose Proposals,
      or campaign for or hold Office.  E is also absolved of any
      duties which would otherwise be required of eim, including
      appointment as a Judge
      (*Was: 464*)
 
"That the Ninny submit a formal Apology" falls under the category of
a duty "which would otherwise be required of eim", and therefore Stella?
is absolved of said duty.
 
"While an Active Ninny is required to post eis Formal Apology within 72
hours of the posting of the Injunction that obliges eim so,
this time limit does not apply to Ninnies On Hold" is therefore judged
TRUE.
 
The time limit specified in Rule 908 therefore does not apply to a Ninny
while e is on hold.

As the discussion has been proceeding in the direction of increased emphasis on
Groups, (and as I had hoped to create one soon at any rate), I hereby announce
my intention to see a new group through to its creation.

The reason I was waiting is that I have been unable to think of any really
great "mission" for said Group.  Therefore, I ask that any Player who has an
idea submit them to me.  I will summarize to the public forum.  Following that,
I will conduct an informal vote on the topic of the Group.

I am not sure whether I want to be an Officer of the Group; we'll see.  However
I will take this Oath: If a Group is created through the method I have outlined
above, myself having conducted the polling and voting, then the Player who
suggested the mission of the group which becomes adopted shall become, if e
wishes, an important official of the new Group.  If multiple Players suggest
very similar ideas, we shall discuss what to do.  (Yes, this Oath does not have
so much force.  Nevertheless this is whet I intend to do, honestly.)

Please send ideas!

Fnord

Status: OR

Proto-Proposal B1
Define Goals
(creates a rule)
 
Let there be an Entity known as the Goal.  One Goal shall exist
for each player.  The Goal shall consist of one sentence, which
begins "Player X's Goal is to " and ends with an explanation of a
possible state of the Game, where X is the name of a Player. 
This Player named shall be known as the goal's owner.  No two
Goals may have the same owner.
 
Let there also be an Entity known as the Success Cache.  Upon
passage of this Rule, ten Kudos shall be created and placed in
the Success Cache.
 
Let there be an Officer known as the Goalkeepor.  The Goalkeepor
shall know all of the Goals of all Players.  The Goalkeepor shall
be responsible for informing the Scorekeepor about any changes in
Kudos as a result of any rules about Goals, and any affected
Players.
 
[This Proto-Proposal shall create Goals for each player, thus
lending some direction to Players.  Currently, some have personal
Goals, while others are vague on the subject.  It also defines
the Success Cache, impotant for the operation of the Goalkeepor.]
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
 
Proto-Proposal B2
Generate Goals
(creates a rule)
 
Upon passage of this Proposal and choice of a Goalkeepor, each
Player shall submit to the Goalkeepor three sample Goals, with
the letter "X" in place of a name of a Player, within four weeks
after the passage of this Proposal.  Players who fail to do so
will lose five Kudos, which shall be placed in the Success Cache,
should it exist.  The Goalkeepor shall have the option of
rejecting any sample goals which e deems too specific or too
difficult to acheive.
 
All Players shall receive two sample Goals selected randomly by
the Goalkeepor from those not rejected.  Each player shall select
one of the sample Goals, and inform the Goalkeepor.  Immediately
thereafter, that sample Goal shall become a real Goal, owned by
the Player who chose it, and the letter X at the beginning shall
be changed to the name of the Player who selected it.
 
All players shall have the option to choose their own Goals.  A
player who chooses this option shall be exempt from the normal
process for creating Goals.  E shall submit three sample Goals in
the normal manner, and one additional sample Goal which e selects
for eimself.  Unless eis chosen sample Goal is rejected by the
Goalkeepor, that sample Goal shall be changed into eis Goal in
the normal manner.  If eis chosen Goal is rejected, e shall
choose another goal for eimself.  If that is also rejected, e
shall receive eis Goal in the same way as Players who did not
choose Self-Determination.
 
When a Player enters the Game, e shall follow this procedrure for
getting a Goal.  When a Game ends, all Goals shall be destroyed
and this process for creating them shall begin again.  If at any
time the Goalkeepor has no sample Goals to assign a Player, e may
call for all Players to submit one new sample Goal each, with a
penalty of one Kudo to be transferred to the Success Cache for
failure to submit a Goal.
 
[If anybody has ideas for additional justifications for rejecting
Goals, please suggest them.  For those who already have personal
goals in Nomic, there is a way to retain these informal goals.]
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
 
Proto-Proposal B3
Secrecy of Goals and Changes in Goalkeepor
(creates a rule)
 
The Goalkeepor shall never diculge any information regarding a
Player's Goal to any Player except the owner of the Goal.  No
other Player is bound by this Rule.
 
Violation of this Rule shall be a class B crime for direct
information regarding a Goal, or in the case of an indirect and
minor hint regarding a Goal, a class C crime.  A CFJ shall
determine which crime, if any, the Goalkeepor is guilty of.  Any
Player whose Goal has been divulged through violation of this
Rule shall be allowed to change eis Goal if a procedure exists
for doing so.  A CFJ shall determine if the Goal has been
divulged.
 
If the Goalkeepor goes on Hold, e shall not tell eis replacement
the Goals of any players.  The replacement Goalkeeper may not
make any Kudo transfers, and must return the Office to the
original Goalkeepor as soon as possible.  If the Goalkeepor
permanently resigns eis Office, e shall inform the new Goalkeepor
of all of the Goals of all Players.  All of eis Kudos are
immediately transferred to the Success Cache, e loses a number of
points equal to the number needed to win the Game, and e is still
bound by this Rule of secrecy.
 
[A great deal of latitude is left up to the Judge in the case of
a violation of this Rule.  Also, a Goalkeepor is very much
discouraged from resigning, as e would have powerful knowledge.]
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
 
Proto-Proposal B4
Reward and Penalize Voting/Proposals According to Goals
(creates a rule)
 
The Goalkeepor shall determine if any Votes made by a Player move
the game state closer to or farther from the state described in
eis Goal.  For every five Votes which further the Player's Goal,
e shall receive one Kudo from the Success Cache.  For every five
Votes which hamper the player's Goal, e shall lose one Kudo to be
placed in the Success Cache.
 
The Goalkeepor shall determine if any Proposals made by a Player
that pass move the game state closer to or farther from the state
described in eis Goal.  For every successful Proposal which
furthers the Player's Goal, e shall receive one Kudo from the
Success Cache.  For every successful Proposal which hampers the
player's Goal, e shall lose one Kudo to be placed in the Success
Cache.
 
Additional legislation may define other Actions which result in
gain or loss of Kudos to or from the Success Cache, as long as
play which furthers a player's Goal is rewarded and/or play which
hampers a player's Goal is punished.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
 
Proto-Proposal B5
Provide for Dispute over Goals
(creates a rule)
 
If a Player disagrees with any Kudo transfers made to or from the
Success Cache, e may submit a Call For Judgement of Success
(CFJS).  A CFJS shall be handled in a manner exactly like a CFJ,
except the CFJS and Judgement shall not be announced to the
Public Forum.
 
The Goalkeepor shall not be penalized for any incorrect Kudo
transfers unless these erroneous transfers are, in the opinion of
the Judge, "very frequent and careless", in which case the
Goalkeepor can be found guilty of a Class B Crime.
 
[Keeps CFJs secret and protects the Goalkeepor, as e would make
many Kudo transfers and disagreements could be frequent.]
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
 
Well folks, that's my Goal plan.  I hope you like it and very
much welcome any comments.  The motivation behind this is to give
motivation to Players for consistently playing toward goal rather
than aimlessly trying to make Proposals.  It would encourage
Proposals and Voting in the absence of Points, should that idea
become a reality.  Finally, should Stella?'s Group reform pass,
and/or other ideas for increasing the importance of Groups, it
would provide an incentive for Players with similar Goals to join
the same Groups.  Fnord.

Coren is right.
Ninny Stella?, that's me, hasn't made eis Formal Apology as yet.

As soon as the Squealer reports the -10 Points to the Scorekeepor
(required by Rule 937) the latter will take the change into account.

What???? Squealer KoJen is On Hold?
Well, we just have to wait then haven't we????

In any case here is the missing Formal Apology. Too bad you didn't
prescribe any words. It's more fun. I will therefore take the first
ten words of my on-line dictionary:

aback
abacus
abalone

****Formal Apology****

Dear KoJen, dear fellow Players,

Forgive me!
There is no thing that Abashed, Abashes and will Abash
me more than the Abasing fact of having made an error in my
beloved score reports.

I don't really know why my brain had Abandoned me, that
day I had picked up my Abacus once more to calculate the scores for
this game of Nomic (the game that makes Abalone look like mere
Tic-Tac-Toe).

What bugged, bugs and will bug me most is the pain, sorrow, selfhate
remorse and pure anguish I must have inflicted on Squealer KoJen.
I am sure it must have taken KoJen Aback, to read and realize
that I had assumed that his Marks Account -which he so diligently
had transfered to the Abelian Treasury- still gave him right to 21
Points of interest, instead of the mere 1 onto which he had Abbreviated
his right to.

Friends, my remorse is so great that I feel like filling all my
e-mail messages with "I am sorry, I am sorry, I am sorry" until the
moment until the Abbot of this Abbey (that has taken me in so
friendly when they saw how the error of my ways made me hate
myself) will Abate my account.

Be assured, however, *this* error I will not make again!

Ninny Scorekeepor Champion Stella?

Here are some ideas for more titles:

-Make Ninny and Squealer Titles when the CFJ is Judged TRUE
(Jeffrey already thinks Ninny is a Title....)

-Rulemaker: for the Player with most Rules in the Rule set
(I promise to go over the logs to determine this one)

-Number Two: for the Player with the most 2nd places over all games

-Starter: for the Players who started e-mail Nomic a Year ago

-Millisime: for the Player who submits Proposal number 1000
   (or the 1000th Proposal, which will be number 1300)

-Centurion: for all Players who submitted proposals whose number
   is divisible by 100

-Misfire: for the Player who submitted the most rejected Proposals
   (could be me....)

New Titles would make the title of Most Titled Player more interesting.
Which reminds me: the Entrepreneur title is still up for grabs.


Greetings,
Stella?

My nickname on Agora Nomic is spelled with a period at the end, thus:
Fnord.

Please modify the white pages to reflect this puctuation (it was the way I
intended it, but did not make myself clear.  Thank you.  Fnord.

[To cure the apparent aimlessness of the current game of Agora
Nomic (for many players)...]
 
Proto-Proposal B1 (Fnord.)
Define Goals
(creates a rule)
 
Let there be an Entity known as the Goal.  One Goal shall exist
for each player.  The Goal shall consist of one sentence, which
begins "Player X's Goal is a Game where " and ends with an
explanation of a possible state of the Game, where X is the name
of a Player or the letter X.  This Player named, if any, shall be
known as the goal's owner.  No two Goals may have the same owner.
 
Let there be an Entity know as the Success Cache.  All rewards
and penalties for Players based on Goals must be paid to or from
the Success Cache.  Upon passage of this Rule, or if the Success
Cache becomes empty, one Kudo shall be transferred from each
active Player and placed in the Success Cache.
 
Let there be an Officer known as the Goalkeepor.  The Goalkeepor
shall keep track of the Goals of all Players.  
 
[This Proto-Proposal shall create Goals for each player, thus
lending some direction to Players.  Currently, some have personal
Goals, while others are vague on the subject.  It also defines
the Success Cache, important for the operation of the
Goalkeepor.]
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
 
Proto-Proposal B2 (Fnord.)
Generate Goals
(creates a rule)
 
Upon passage of this Proposal and choice of a Goalkeepor, each
Player shall submit to the Goalkeepor three sample Goals, with
the letter "X" in place of a name of a Player, within four weeks
after the passage of this Proposal.  Players who fail to do so
will lose five Kudos, which shall be placed in the Success Cache.
 
The Goalkeepor shall then create a List of all sample Goals and
submit it to the Public Forum.  The Goalkeepor may reject any
sample Goals which are significantly harder or easier to achieve
than the average sample Goal.  If any sample Goals are very
similar to another sample Goal, the Goalkeepor shall only place
one of the group of similar Goals on the List.
 
Each Player shall then select one sample Goal and inform the
Goalkeepor.  If two Players choose the same sample Goal, either
may have the option of changing eir choice.  If one Player
behaved more in a manner similar to eir chosen sample Goal that
the other, then the former player shall receive the sample Goal
and the latter shall choose another.  If still there is a
dispute, a bidding war shall be conducted in a manner identical
to the method for bidding on Stocks, with the proceeds going to
the Bank.
 
This list shall be transformed into a proper Proposal with the
NRC declaration (assigns Goals) and an Adoption Factor of 1.  If
it passes, all sample Goals shall be modified so that each Player
owns the goal e chose.  If it fails, the Goalkeepor shall modify
the list in a way intended to allow it to pass, and keep doing so
until it does pass.
 
When a Player enters the Game, e shall choose a Goal from the
remaining Goals on the List that were not assigned.  This Goal
shall be converted to a Proposal in the same way as above, and if
it passes the Goal shall be modified so that Player owns the
Goal.  If it fails, the player must go through this process
again.  When a Game ends, all Goals shall be destroyed. and this
process for creating them shall begin again.  If at any time the
Goalkeepor has insufficient sample Goals to assign a Player, e
may call for all Players to submit one new sample Goal each, with
a penalty of one Kudo to be transferred to the Success Cache for
failure to submit a Goal.
 
[If anybody has ideas for additional justifications for rejecting
Goals, please suggest them.  For those who already have personal
goals in Nomic, they are given priority to retain these informal
goals.]
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
 
Proto-Proposal B3 (Fnord.)
Reward and Penalize Voting/Proposals According to Goals
(creates a rule)
 
The Goalkeepor shall determine if any Votes made by a Player move
the game state closer to or farther from the state described in
eis Goal.  For every five Votes which further the Player's Goal,
e shall receive one Kudo.  For every five Votes which hamper the
player's Goal, e shall lose one Kudo.
 
The Goalkeepor shall determine if any Proposals made by a Player
that pass move the game state closer to or farther from the state
described in eis Goal.  For every successful Proposal which
furthers the Player's Goal, e shall receive one Kudo.  For every
successful Proposal which hampers the player's Goal, e shall lose
one Kudo.
 
The Goalkeepor shall publish a Success Report of all Kudos
transferred as a result of any Rules involving Goals every time a
Voting period ends, or if a Player is partway toward receiving or
losing a Kudo, how far e is from receiving of losing a Kudo.  The
Herald must make all Kudo transfers specified in the Success
Report.
 
Additional legislation may define other Actions which result in
gain or loss of Kudos, as long as play which furthers a player's
Goal is rewarded and/or play which hampers a player's Goal is
punished.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
 
Proto-Proposal B4 (Fnord.)
Ultimate Reward for Achievement of Goal
(creates a rule)
 
If a Player believes that the current state of the Game coincides
with the state described in any Player's Goal, e shall submit a
CFJ.  If this CFJ is judged True, then the Player whose Goal
matches the state of the Game shall receive exactly the number of
Points needed to Win.  Two Players may accomplish their Goals
simultaneously, in which case both win the Game.
 
[In real life, it could be said that one "wins" if one
accomplishes ones goals in life.  The same should hold true for
Agora Nomic.]
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
 
Well folks, that's my Goal plan.  I hope you like it and very
much welcome any comments.  The motivation behind this is to give
motivation to Players for consistently playing toward goal rather
than aimlessly trying to make Proposals.  It would encourage
Proposals and Voting in the absence of Points, should that idea
become a reality.  Finally, should Stella?'s Group reform pass,
and/or other ideas for increasing the importance of Groups, it
would provide an incentive for Players with similar Goals to join
the same Groups.  Fnord.

PROTO-PROPOSAL XXX (Chuck)

On/Off Hold Messages directly to all Players
(Amends a Rule)

The first paragraph of Rule 870 is amended to read:

A Player may choose to be placed On Hold at any time by
notifying all other Players of the fact.  If a Player wishes
to cease being On Hold, that Player shall notify all other Players
of the fact.  A Player may not be On Hold for less than 96
consecutive hours.

[A player going on/off hold notifies all other players directly.
In this way, only one message (public or private) is necessary.]

THE CURRENT RULESET

Rules are listed as follows, where NNN represents the Rule number:

========================================

Rule NNN (Immutable or Mutable)
My Own Unofficial Title

NNN.  Semi-Official Rule Title, If There Is One

      Text of Rule

Annotation: Some Rules are annotated as required by Rule 789.
These annotations "shall guide the interpretation
of that Rule."
Relevant Rules: Such annotations include a list of relevant Rules.

[Note: Some Rules are annotated by me to clarify their interpretation.
Unlike the official annotations, these are enclosed in brackets.
These annotations have no legal force in and of themselves.]

========================================



========================================

Rule 101 (Immutable)
Obey the Rules

101.

      All Players must always abide by all the Rules then in effect,
      in the form in which they are then in effect.  The Rules in the
      Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the first game.
      The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (Immutable) and
      201-219 (Mutable).

========================================

Rule 102 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Rules

102.

      Initially Rules in the 100's are Immutable and Rules in the
      200's are Mutable.  Rules subsequently Enacted or Transmuted
      (that is, changed from Immutable to Mutable or vice versa) may
      be Immutable or Mutable regardless of their Numbers, and Rules
      in the Initial Set may be Transmuted regardless of their Numbers.

========================================

Rule 103 (Immutable)
The Speaker and Voters

103.

      At any time, each Player shall be either a Voter or the Speaker;
      no Player may simultaneously be a Voter and a Speaker. At any
      time, there shall be exactly one Speaker. The term "Player" in
      the Rules shall specifically include both the Voters and the
      Speaker.

========================================

Rule 104 (Immutable)
First Speaker

104.

      The Speaker for the first game shall be Michael Norrish.

========================================

Rule 105 (Immutable)
What Is a Rule Change?

105.

      A Rule Change is any of the following:  (1) the enactment,
      repeal, or amendment of a mutable Rule; or (2) the transmutation
      of an immutable Rule into a mutable Rule or vice versa.
        (Note:  This definition implies that, at least initially, all
      new Rules are Mutable; Immutable Rules, as long as they are
      Immutable, may not be Amended or Repealed; Mutable Rules, as long
      as they are Mutable, may be Amended or Repealed; any Rule of any
      status may be Transmuted; no Rule is absolutely immune to change.)

========================================

Rule 106 (Immutable)
Adopting Proposed Rule Changes

106.

      All Rule Changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on.
      They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required
      number of votes and Quorum is achieved.

========================================

Rule 107 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Must Be Written Down

107.

      Any proposed Rule Change must be written down (or otherwise
      communicated in print media) before it is voted on. If adopted,
      it must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.

========================================

Rule 108 (Immutable)
When May Rule Changes Take Effect?

108.

      No Rule Change may take effect earlier than the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording
      explicitly states otherwise.  No rule change may have retroactive
      application.

========================================

Rule 109 (Immutable)
Rule Numbers

109.

      The Speaker shall give each proposed Rule Change a Number for
      reference.  The numbers shall begin with 301, and each Rule
      Change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next
      successive integer, whether or not the Proposal is adopted.
        If a Rule is Repealed and Reenacted, it receives the Number of
      the Proposal to Reenact it.  If a Rule is Amended or Transmuted,
      it receives the Number of the Proposal to Amend or Transmute it.
 
========================================

Rule 110 (Immutable)
Transmutation of Rules

110.

      Rule Changes that Transmute Immutable Rules into Mutable Rules
      may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among Votes
      legally cast.  Transmutation shall not be implied, but must be
      stated explicitly in a Proposal to take effect.
 
========================================

Rule 111 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Conflicts

111.

      In a conflict between a Mutable and an Immutable Rule, the
      immutable Rule takes precedence and the Mutable Rule shall be
      entirely void.  For the purposes of this Rule a Proposal to
      Transmute an Immutable Rule does not "conflict" with that
      Immutable Rule.
 
========================================

Rule 112 (Immutable)
Winning Must Be by Points

112.

      The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered
      from achieving n points to any other state of affairs.  The
      magnitude of n and the means of earning points may be changed,
      and Rules that establish a Winner when play cannot continue may
      be Enacted and (while they are mutable) be Amended or Repealed.
 
========================================

Rule 113 (Immutable)
Players May Always Forfeit

113.

      A Player always has the option to forfeit the Game rather than
      continue to play or incur a Game penalty.  No penalty worse than
      losing, in the judgment of the Player to incur it, may be
      imposed.

========================================

Rule 114 (Immutable)
At Least One Mutable Rule

114.

      There must always be at least one Mutable Rule.  The adoption of
      Rule Changes must never become completely inpermissible.

========================================

Rule 115 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Which Change Rule-Changing Rules Allowed

115.

      Rule Changes that affect Rules needed to allow or apply
      Rule Changes are as permissible as other Rule Changes.  Even
      Rule Changes that amend or repeal their own authority are
      permissible.  No Rule Change or type of move is impermissible
      solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a
      Rule.

========================================

Rule 116 (Immutable)
Permissibility of the Unprohibited

116.

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
      and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
      which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly or
      implicitly permits it.

========================================

Rule 206 (Mutable)
One Voter, One Vote

206.

      Each Voter has exactly one Vote.  The Speaker may not Vote.

========================================

Rule 208 (Mutable)
End of the Voting Period

208.

      At the end of the prescribed Voting Period on a Proposal, the
      Speaker shall reveal all Votes legally cast on that Proposal. If
      the Speaker's consent may be required for a Proposal to be
      adopted then the Speaker should indicate at that time whether or
      not e gives eir consent.  If the Speaker does not explicitly
      indicate that e refuses to consent to the Proposal, it shall be
      assumed that e consents.

========================================

Rule 212 (Mutable)
Resolving Rule Conflicts

212.

      If two or more Mutable Rules conflict with one another, or if
      two or more Immutable Rules conflict with one another, then the
      Rule with the lowest ordinal Number takes precedence.
        If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of rule) or takes
      precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.
        If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

========================================

Rule 217 (Mutable)
Judgements Must Accord with the Rules

217.

      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however, if
      the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the Statement
      to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider Game Custom and the
      Spirit of the Game before applying other standards.

========================================

Rule 312 (Mutable)
A Point for Voting

312.

      If a Voter votes, he gets one (1) point at the end of the Voting
      Period.

========================================

Rule 376 (Mutable)
When Does a Rule Change Take Effect?

376.  Time that a rule change takes effect:

      An adopted rule change takes full effect at the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it.
      The moment of the completion of the vote is defined by the date
      and time given in the line starting with "Date:" of the Nomic
      listserver message send by the Benevolent Speaker, announcing
      the result of the vote on the corresponding proposal.

========================================

Rule 388 (Mutable)
Game Status When a New Game Begins

388.  Starting a new Game:

      Whenever a new game of Nomic is begun, the status of the new
      Game when it begins shall be the same as the status of the old
      Game when it ended, in all respects where the Rules do not
      decide otherwise.

========================================

Rule 399 (Mutable)
The Office of the Rulekeepor

399.  The Office of the Rulekeepor:

      Let there be an Officer known as the Rulekeepor.
      The Rulekeepor shall maintain a complete list of the current
      Rules, and post this list to all Players at least once a week.
      
      So long as the Rulekeepor is in Office, the Speaker is not
      required to maintain or distribute the Rules.

========================================

Rule 402 (Mutable)
Transfer of Power of the Mighty Speaker

402.  Transfer of Power of the Mighty Speaker:

      When one Mighty Speaker is yielding his Office to another, the
      following procedure shall be followed:
      
       1) The Present Mighty Speaker shall forward copies of all
          necessary materials for the performance of his Office to the
          Prospective Mighty Speaker.
       2) The Prospective Mighty Speaker shall acknowledge the receipt
          of said materials.
       3) The Present Mighty Speaker shall post a message to the
          listserv announcing the official transfer of power, which
          occurs at the "Date:" of the Present Mighty Speaker's
          posting.
      
      The Present Mighty Speaker remains in Office until the successful
      completion of step 3.

========================================

Rule 404 (Mutable)
Legality of Proposals

404.  Legality of Proposals:

      As long as a Proposal satisfies all requirements in place at the
      time of its making for the proper making of Proposals, the act
      of making such a Proposal is legal regardless of its content.
      It is legal to propose a Rule which conflicts with other Rules
      or with itself, which is paradoxical, or which cannot be
      applied.

========================================

Rule 407 (Mutable)
Invoking Judgement

407.  Clerk of the Courts, Part II: Invoking Judgement:

      If Players disagree about the legality of a Move or the
      interpretation or application of a Rule, then a Player may
      invoke Judgement by submitting a Statement for Judgement to the
      Clerk of the Courts.  Disagreement, for the purposes of this
      Rule, may be created by the insistence of any Player.  When
      Judgement is invoked, the Clerk of the Courts must, as soon as
      possible, select a Judge as described in the Rules.  The Clerk
      of the Courts must then distribute the Statement to be judged,
      along with the identity of the Judge, to all Players.

========================================

Rule 408 (Mutable)
Accepting Judge-ship

408.  Clerk of the Courts, Part III: Accepting Judge-ship:

      After the Clerk of the Courts has distributed the Statement to
      be judged and the identity of the Judge, the Judge has one week
      in which to deliver a legal Judgement.  If the Judge fails to
      deliver a Judgement within this time, e is penalized 10 points

========================================

Rule 413 (Mutable)
Winning by Paradox

413.  Winning By Paradox:

      If the Rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or
      if the legality of some action cannot be determined with
      finality, or if some action appears equally legal and illegal,
      then a player may Call For Judgement on a Statement to that
      effect.  If the Statement is judged TRUE, then the same Judge
      who judged the Statement TRUE must declare the most recent
      passed Proposal X such that the Statement was not TRUE before
      the passage of Proposal X, or declare that there is no such
      Proposal.  (Until the Judge does this, the Judgment is not
      valid.)  If the Judgement of TRUE is not overruled, then the
      Player who called for Judgement is declared the Winner of the
      game.
      
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared that
      there is no such Proposal X, the game is ended, with no
      provisions for restarting it.
      
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared such
      a Proposal X, the following actions are taken:
         - all Players remain active,
         - all Proposals curently being Voted upon are removed from
           consideration for Voting,
         - the scores for all Players are set to 0 (zero),
         - the Rules and explicit game custom are reverted to the
           state they were in before Proposal X was passed,
         - a Benevolent Speaker for the next Game is chosen:
              -If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the
               Benevolent Speaker, and the old Benevolent Speaker
               becomes a Voter,
              -If there is more than one Winner, the Benevolent
               Speaker randomly selects one of the Winners, who
               becomes the new Benevolent Speaker, and the old
               Benevolent Speaker becomes a Voter,
         - and a new Game is begun.

      Proposal, the Mighty Speaker shall assign the Proposal a Number
      and distribute the Proposal along with its number to all
      Players.
      
      The Mighty Speaker may also make Proposals. The Mighty Speaker
      must process all pending Voter-submitted Proposals first, and
      may then Process Proposals of the Mighty Speaker, assigning
      these Proposals a number and distributing them in the same
      fashion as any other Proposal.

Rule 417 (Mutable)
The Nomic Archivist

417.  Establishment of the Office of Archivist:

      That there be established an office known as the Nomic
      Archivist, which shall be governed by the default Rules
      concerning official posts. The initial duties of the Nomic
      Archivist shall be to record the passage and failure of
      Proposals, to maintain a "historical record" (defined below)
      of the Ruleset, to maintain a list of Judgements and their case
      histories, and to maintain a list of game Winners in past games.
      The Archivist is free to comment on the historical records as
      they see fit, but such commentary must be clearly delimited
      from the historical material. Where the material being stored
      does not already admit a classification method, the Archivist
      is free to design one themselves.

      The "historical record" of the Ruleset maintained by the
      Archivist is one that includes all rules ever part of the nomic
      Ruleset, annotated with information as to their ultimate fate,
      whether Repealed or Amended etc. This record of the Ruleset has
      no legal force.

      The duties required of the Archivist may be changed with their
      consent and at the request of the Office's controlling body
      (whatsoever that may be). Initially, the controlling body of
      this Office shall be all Players, and any request to change the
      duties must therefore be supported by a majority of Players
      "speaking" to the request.  Naturally, default Rules for
      Offices may establish a different controlling body for this
      Office.
      
      The salary of the Archivist office shall be determined by its
      controlling body. Initially, its salary shall be 5 points and
      one coin of the office-holder's group per week.
      
      The initial office-holder for this post shall be Michael
      Norrish.

      for a length of time equal to the longest possible voting period
      on a proposal. At the end of this time, he is deregistered.
 
      During the time between forfeiting and being deregistered, the
      player may not vote or make a proposal.  The player
      automatically refuses any selection for judgement, or any other
      voluntary appointed duties.
 
      If, at any time during this period, the player announces that

      The number of each type of Currency owned by each player or

               a Currency
            b) a player may not transfer more of a Currency than e
               currently has.

      rules. An Injunction is a statement or series of statements
      specifying an action or actions which must take place. If a
      Judgement is is accompanied by an Injunction, that Injunction
      must be published with the Judgement. All players must abide by
      the Injunction beginning no later than 72 hours after its
      publication unless one of the following conditions then apply:
        - The Judgement which the Injunction accompanies is undergoing
          appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of the appeal
          process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but a proposal
          has been published which would overturn that decision if
          passed, and said proposal has not failed.
        - The validity of the Injunction itself is questioned by a
          pending CFJ.
        - A Judgement upholding the validity of the Injunction is
          undergoing appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of
          the appeal process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but
          a proposal has been published which would overturn that
          decision if passed, and said proposal has not failed.

      A Judgement may not be accompanied by an Injunction unless it is
      specifically permitted elsewhere in the rules. An Injunction
      must be completely consistent with all rules in effect at the
      time of issuance, and must be completely relevant to the matter
      addressed in the corresponding judgement.

      If any Player believes that an Injunction or any part of it does
      not meet the criteria for a valid Injunction, e may submit a CFJ
      to that effect. If the resulting Judgement supports the
      contention that the criteria are not met, the Injunction shall
      be considered illegal and shall have no legal force.

      This rule takes precedence over all rules governing Injunctions.

      state. The adjustments to the game state must have been
      unambiguously specified within the CFJ, and these adjustments
      must only undo actions which were a direct or indirect result of
      that Move.

          Speaker and the old Speaker becomes a Voter.
        - If there is more than one Winner, the Voter with the highest Point 
          total becomes the new Speaker.  If more than one Voter is

          one of them to become the new Speaker.  The old Speaker
          becomes a voter.

      The determination and announcement of assignment and revoking
      of the Title is made by the Banker, who must use the most
      accurate means of determining this available to eim, and must
      make the announcement as soon as possible after becoming aware
      of a change in holder of the Title.

      However: To respect some Players' wish for privacy, and in
      view of the secret nature of Marks accounts, a prospective
      Marxist must first be asked if e wants the Title. If not, then
      instead of announcing, "Player x is granted the Patent Title of
      'Marxist', e announces, "Patent Title of 'Marxist' is granted
       to an anonymous Player".

      Any Player or Group X may perform an Act of Mischief directed

      are defined in other Rules; such definitions must include a 
      positive Price in Coins, or the form of Mischief is not
      permissible.  This Rule explicitly takes precedence over all
      other Rules which purport to determine which forms of Mischief
      are permissible.

      To cause an Act of Mischief,  X  sends to the Public Forum a
      message containing:
      - the Name of the object, Y;
      - the effect of the Act of Mischief;
      - the Number of the Rule which permits the form of Mischief;
      - indication of which Coins in X's account will be used as
      payment for the Act of Mischief.  Coins of Group Y, or the
      Group to which Player Y belongs, may not be used as payment.  

      The effect of the Act of Mischief is applied immediately upon 
      publication of the above message in the Forum.  An additional
      effect of this Act of Mischief is that
      - for each Coin of Group Z spent as payment above, two Points
      are removed from the Z Treasury;
      - the Coins used as payment above are removed from X's account
      and destroyed.

Rule 766 (Mutable)
Groups

766.  Amend Rule 714.

      A Group is initially formed by a set of Players which has
      registered with the Registrar to form a Group; other Players may
      join later.  Each Group has a Name, a Membership, a Vizier,
      an Ordinancekeepor, a Treasury, an Initial Set of Ordinances,
      and an associated form of Currency, called the <name> Coins,
      where <name> is the Name of the Group.

      1.  The Name may not be the Name of another Group.

      2.  The Membership is a set of Players;  these Players are
      Members of the Group, and all other Players are not.

      3.  Synchronously with the registration of a Group, two Offices
      are created known as the <name> Vizier, and the <name>
      Ordinancekeepor, where <name> is the Name of the Group.
      These Offices may never be empty, and the <name> Vizier and
      <name> Ordinancekeepor must both be a member of <name> Group.
      The <name> Vizier shall inform the Registrar whenever the
      Membership or the Ordinancekeepor of the <name> group changes.
      When the <name> Vizier changes, the new Vizier shall inform the
      Registrar of the change.
      The <name> Ordinancekeepor shall keep an accurate and current
      record of the Ordinances of the <name> Group.

      4.  The Treasury is a repository for Points and Currencies and
      has the same capabilities for holding, trading, and spending
      Points and Currencies as does a Player.

      5.  The Ordinances are a description of the operation of the
      Group.

      6.  The <name> Coins are a form of Currency which is created
      synchronously with the registration of the Group.  The <name>
      Group may create <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be
      placed in the <name> Treasury.  The <name> Group may destroy
      <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be removed from the
      <name> Treasury.

      Ordinances of a Group may determine how and when the Group
      casts its Votes; if the Ordinances are silent on this issue
      then the Group may not cast its Votes.  The Votes of the
      Group are cast when the Vizier sends a message to the Speaker
      to that effect during the Voting Period and this action is

      E must inform both the Banker and the Speaker when doing so.
      A Proposal which has Sanity imposed upon it is known as a Sane
      Proposal.  The Speaker shall, when e distributes a Sane
      Proposal, inform the Players that it is a Sane Proposal.

      No non-Voter Nomic entity may Vote on a Sane Proposal.  Each
      Voter shall have exactly one Vote on a Sane Proposal, and
      each Voter's Vote shall be counted exactly once on a Sane
      Proposal.

      This rule takes precedence over any rule allowing a non-Voter
      Nomic entity to Vote; over any rule which gives any Voter

Abandonment of Speakerhood

785.  Improve Speaker Succession I

      If the Speaker has abandoned eir post, another new, Temporary
      Speaker is selected according to the "Rules of Succession", or
      if no such rules are defined, the other Player not on hold with
      the highest Score becomes the temporary Speaker.  This does not
      force the Game to be over in this case, and Scores are not reset
      to 0. The Game continues until a Player Wins, at which time a
      new Game is begun and the Winner becomes the real Speaker. The
      Temporary Speaker shall make reasonable effort to obtain the
      former Speaker's materials: proposal queue, voting records, etc.
      but if this is not possible, then the Temporary Speaker shall
      request that these be resubmitted by the Players. If a Speaker
      is replaced in this manner, e has eir score set to minus 2N
      Points immediately, where N is the number of Points required for
      a Player to Win the Game.

      Abandonment is determined as follows: If any Player suspects
      that the Speaker has Abandoned, e sends a message to all Players
      calling on the Speaker to announce eir presence.  The Speaker
      must reply to all Players within one week; if e does not, e is

      Rules relevant to that CFJ, which must include the Rule in

      Judge the Statement as if they were Judges.  They may confer
      with each other on the case before delivering Judgement if they
      desire.  If a Justice should fail to return Judgement in the
      allotted time, e shall be fined three Points for each day by
      which e missed the deadline.  This fine shall be levied by the
      Scorekeepor.

      If a majority of the Justices' Judgements agree, the Statement
      shall be considered to have been Judged accordingly.  Otherwise,
      it shall be considered to have been ruled UNDECIDED.  The
      Justices' reasoning and arguments shall be recorded with the
      original CFJ.

      Once a Judgement has been made, the Justices may make
      Injunctions just as may Judges, provided a majority of them

      The decision of the Justices is final; no further Appeal of that
      Statement may be made.

931.  Cure 725

      Let there be for each Player one Currency called X Stock,
      where X is the name of the Player.

      The Dividend on Stock X shall be 2 Points or 5% of the Points of
      Player X on Friday Noon GMT (whatever is more).
      The Dividend shall be transfered on Friday Noon GMT to the

      At the passing of this Proposal the Bank has possession of all
      Stocks.  During the following week the Banker shall collect the
      bids in Marks.  Those bids have to be made by the Players

      highest bidders), or to the Player with the lowest score.

      If a given Stock X is bought by Player X, the Marks of the bid
      shall be transfered from Player X to the Bank.

      point for each Proposal proposed by em which either is currently
      up for Vote, or has been sent to the Speaker but not yet

        --the "1 point" in the first paragraph shall be amended to
          "0.1 Marks"
        --the "Scorekeepor" in the second paragraph shall be amended
          to "Banker"

Rule 937 (Mutable)
Who's Responsible for Point Changes

937.  Point Changes Requested By Other Players, Part 1

      The Legal Responsibility for detecting the following classes of
      Point changes and reporting them to the Scorekeepor is bestowed
      upon another Player:

      * All Point changes directly related to the submission of
      Proposals: responsibility of Speaker, who must report these no
      later than the message announcing the voting results.

      * All Point changes directly related to voting on Proposals:
      responsibility of Speaker, who must report these no later than
      the message announcing the voting results.

      * All point changes resulting from Vototron contributions:
      responsibility of Speaker, who must report these no later than
      the message announcing the voting results.

      * All point changes resulting from fees for judgements, salaries
      and penalties given to judges: responsibility of Clerk of the
      Courts, who must report these as soon as possible, and no later
      than the message announcing the outcome of the judgement.

      * Electioneer per-position-filled salary: responsibility of
      Electioneer to notify Scorekeepor within one Week.

      * Point changes regarding the "Squealer/Ninny" Rule: If the
      Ninny must lose Points, the responsibility lies with the
      Squealer for informing the Scorekeepor as soon as possible.

      * Marks interest: responsibility of Banker to nofify Scorekeepor
      as soon as possible following the mandated interst payment.

      * Proposal lottery: responsibility of Sweepstakes Officer, who
      must notify Scorekeepor as soon as possible after the drawing.

      * Ambassador salary: responsibility of Ambassador for notifying
      Scorekeepor no later than one Week following the time the
      payment is earned.

      * Stock dividends: responsibility of the Scorekeepor who
      calculates the dividends earned. However The Banker must notify
      the Scorekeepor of changes in the Stock ownership.

      The Scorekeepor notification must be via the public forum or, if
      individually subscribable distribution lists are implemented,
      must be made on a distribution list which is potentially
      available to anyone who wishes to subscribe to it.  This
      paragraph takes precendence over other Rules which would require
      a private Scorekeepor notification. The notification need not be
      on a separate message, as long as the Scorekeepor is mentioned,
      and the message is on a list which is received by the
      Scorekeepor.

      Other classes of Point changes whose legal responsibilty for
      reporting is other than the Scorekeepor may be defined by other
      Rules.

938.  Find More Players

      The Ambassador is hereby directed to obtain new Players for
      Agora Nomic. For each new Player who joins at the invitation of
      the Ambassador and remains an Active Player for a full Game, the
      Ambassador receives 6 Points. The Ambassador is encouraged to
      share this bounty with the new Player. Responsibility for
      notifying the Scorekeepor is given to the Ambassador, who must
      make the notification within the next Game following the first
      full Game for which the new Player is registered. The new Player
      must mention that e was invited by the Ambassador before the end
      of the first full Game; this must be made to the public forum,

Rule 941 (Mutable)
Punishments for Crimes

941.  Punishment for Crimes

      If a Player is found Guilty of a Crime because a Criminal Court
      has indicated so, e shall lose Points as follows according to
      the Class of Crime of which e is Guilty of: Class A = 2;
      Class B = 5; Class C = 8; Class D = 15. If a Player is found

      shall lose Points as follows according to the Class of Crime
      which e is Guilty of: Class A = 1; Class B = 3; Class C = 5;
      Class D = 10.

Rule 942 (Mutable)
Replacement of Impossible Speaker

942.  Replacement of Impossible Speaker

      If a Speaker is determined by CFJ to have made further play
      impossible by eir actions or lack thereof, and the CFJ is not
      appealed within the allowed time, then a new Speaker is selected
      according to the "Rules of Succession", or if no such rules are
      defined, the other Player not on hold with the highest Score
      becomes the Speaker.  This does not force the Game to be over in
      this case, and Scores are not reset to 0. The Game continues
      until a Player Wins, at which time a new Game is begun and the
      Winner becomes the Speaker. The new Speaker shall make
      reasonable effort to obtain the former Speaker's materials:
      proposal queue, voting records, etc., but if this is not
      possible, then the new Speaker shall request that these be
      resubmitted by the Players. If a Speaker is replaced in this
      manner, e has eir score set to minus 2N Points immediately,
      where N is the number of Points required for a Player to Win the
      Game; this is the Scorekeepor's responsibility.

      "Impossible" is defined here to mean overwhelmingly psychotic
      behavior, a complete lack of interest in the Game, or
      uncooperativeness of the highest order. It does *not* include
      normal Speaker latitudes which have been taken by past Speakers
      for various reasons, whether justifiable or not, including but
      not limited to: temporary suspension of proposal distribution,
      resetting of scores, or the commission of Crimes or accidental
      illegal actions. The Judge of the CFJ *must* take these
      extremely tight standards into account, and the accused Speaker
      *must* be given an opportunity to defend eirself.

      This Rule adds to the set of valid classes of Judgements, and
      takes precedence over other Rules which may attempt to prevent
      this class of Judgement.

Rule 947 (Mutable)
