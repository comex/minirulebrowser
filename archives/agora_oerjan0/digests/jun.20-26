Announcement:

On 8 June, I sent a message to all players requesting the Speakor to make
hirself known. I received no such message, so moved on to the next step - a
call for players who would be willing to take up the mantle. I received
messages from KoJen, Bowen, and Lance. By Rule 786, the "Rule of
Succession" goes Archivist (Garth - ineligible), Clerk of the Courts (Lance
- not interested), Rulekeepor (Chuck - no message of intent), "all other
Officers in descending Point order" (To make things easier, let's use the
score report in which Bowen is the officer with the highest number of
points). Therefore, I declare that Bowen should make every effort to gather
the Speakor's materials and take over hir rightful place as Speakor.

Let's get going!

++Ian

   I have attempted to contact ex-Speaker Garth and arrange transfer of the
Speaker's materials, so far to no avail.  I have a copy of at least some of
the Proposals that were up for a vote and will restart voting on them at this
time.  If there are other proposals that were previously distributed, please
send me copies of them and I will redistribute them.

David Bowen
Speaker, Agora Nomic
-----------
=======================

Proposal 918 (Duane)

Nuke the Marxist
(Creates a Rule)

At noon GMT on every fourth Monday of each month, the Banker shall 
remove 1/2 of the Marxist's Marks and divide them evenly amongst all
of the active players, including the Marxist.

======================

Proposal 919 (Ko-Jen)

Make Stella? a Scamster
(awards a patent title)

The Patent Title of Scamster shall be awarded to Stella?

======================

Proposal 920 (Ko-Jen)

The Point Sucker
(creates a rule)

Let there be an entity known as the Point Sucker. The Point Sucker
operates continuously to reset the Points of every Game Entity to 0,
such that while the Point Sucker is operating on a particular Game
Entity, there is no instant at which that Entity's Score is anything
other than 0, regardless of the number of Points gained or lost by
that Entity by other Rules.

The Point Sucker becomes converted to a Point Spewer for an
infinitessimal period of time when a different Player becomes the
Current Champion. During this infinitessimal period of time the Point
Spewer conveys to the new Current Champion the exact number of Points
required to Win, while still operating as a Sucker to all other
Entities.

This Rule takes precedence over Rules governing the Point Reserve,
should such Rules exist.

[Justification: Simplifies Scorekeeping (!), gets around the immutable
Rule requiring Points to Win, and shifts the Game priorities to
something other than Points.]

Proposal 921 (Ko-Jen)

Current Champion
(creates a rule)

Let there be a Patent Title known as the Current Champion. Any Player
may be Current Champion; however, no more than one Player at a time
may be Current Champion. Assignment of the Current Champion is
governed by other Rules.

[Justification: A Player needs to get the Current Champion to Win. How
does e get the Current Champion, with no Rules governing assignment of
Current Champion? There will be eventually, if a Player wants to Win
badly enough!]

=======================

This is not a Proposal because of Ko-Jen's preexisting one.  I'm just
including it to let Ian know I got it, and to note that he gets the
2 Points for Proto-Proposing.

Non-Proposal (Ian) P

Scamster to Stella?
(Award a Patent Title)

Upon passage of this Proposal, the patent title of "Scamster" will be
awarded to Stella?, who must pay the one-time fee of 1 Point to the Point
Reserve upon receiving the Title. This fee is not optional, and the Patent
Title may not be declined.

======================================================================

Proposal 922 (Jason) P

Patent Title of Prize Doofus
(creates a rule)

Let there be a Patent Title known as Prize Doofus, which shall be
given to such persons who display incredible stupidity, backwardness,
arrogance and ignorance; in the collective opinion of Players of 
eNomic.

This title may be held by Players of Agora Nomic, but is not limited 
to such individuals.  

Candidates for this patent title shall be nominated by any Agora
Nomic Player, in the public forum, whereafter an informal election
will be held.  The election will be conducted by the current Agora
Nomic Banker.  If the Banker receives more FOR votes than AGAINST
votes within the one week period after the nomination, the Patent
Title shall be awarded.  Note that this election has no quorum, and
is not subject to group votes or vototron votes.

The Patent Title(s) of Prize Doofus, if awarded, shall be recorded in 
the Official Phone Books.

======================================================================

Proposal 923 (Jason) P

Amending Rule 825 to give it legal force
(amends a rule)

Let the text of rule 825 be amended to read as follows:

      Proposals may affect the game when the effect/s is based on
      votes or activities before the passage of said Proposal only if
      said Proposal was passed unanimously.

      For the purpose of this Rule, Proposals that are passed without 
      receiving any AGAINST votes are considered to be unanimous.

      This rule takes precedence over any other rules regarding 
      voting.

[This proposed amendment simply asserts precedence of this rule over
rule 761.  CFJ 123 determined that 825 was without force because 761
implicitly took precedence.  The proposal rectifies matters.]

======================================================================

Proposal 924 (Jason) P

Amending Rule 856 to give it legal force
(amends a rule)

Let the text of rule 856 be amended to read as follows:

      Any Proposal which introduces a new way to Create or Destroy
      a Conserved Quantity shall require at least three times as
      many FOR Votes as AGAINST Votes in order to pass.  This
      restriction does not apply to Proposals which define new
      Conserved Quantities or Create the initial stock of a new
      Conserved Quantity.

      This rule takes precedence over any other rules regarding
      voting.

[This proposed amendment simply asserts precedence of this rule over
rule 761.  CFJ 128 determined that 856 was without force because 761
implicitly took precedence.  The proposal rectifies matters.]

========================

PROPOSAL 925 (Stella?) P

Cure 463
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 463 to read:
At least once in any seven day period, the designated scorekeeper
shall distribute the scores of all Players, updated at least up to
and including the previous complete Nomic Week.

If a Player feels that the posted scores are in error, e shall send
a public message pointing out the error.
If the Scorekeepor agrees e shall correct the error and send out
the corrected score report within 72 hours.

If the Scorekeepor disagrees or does not correct the error, the Player
who pointed out the error, may make a Call for Judgement, stating the
error and its correction.
If the resulting Judgement is TRUE, then
-the Scorekeepor shall correct the error and send out the corrected
score report within 72 hours;
-the Scorekeepor shall not receive eis salary in the Nomic week
following the Judgment of the CFJ.

If no errors are pointed out in this way within seven days of the posting
of the scores, then those scores shall be considered to be the accurate
and actual scores for the Game.

[Differences:
1) defined a time limit so that the Scorekeepor is not too far behind;
2) defined an informal and a formal way to correct errors;
3) took out `best efforts' (superflu as e has to obey the Rules);
4) obliged the scorekeepor to correct errors;
5) fines the scorekeepor if it requires a CFJ to get eim correct
his errors]

[ Certainly does clarify things, but rather useless if the Point Sucker
passes. :) ]

====

PROPOSAL 926 (Stella?) P

Cure 905
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 905 to read:
If a Rule mandates a change in score, but no Rules exist which
define the Player Legally Responsible for detecting and
reporting the change to the Scorekeepor, then the Scorekeepor is
responsible for detecting the score change.
No future Rule shall mandate a score change within naming the
Player responsable for detecting and reporting the score change.

[Made the Scorekeepor legally responsible for detecting changes
for which no other Officer is responsible.
Made it impossible for future Rules to mandate changes without
a Player reporting.]

[ Fills a loophole that had worried me.  Good show! ]

====

PROPOSAL 927 (Stella?)

Timing of scorechanges
(Creates a Rule)

Score changes shall be taken into account in the order that they
are reported by the responsible Player, unless a Rule explicitly
determines otherwise.

If a Player is more than seven days late in reporting a score change,
which e is required to report, and a second Player notices so,
than the second Player shall inform the Scorekeepor and the first
Player of this oversight.


====

PROPOSAL 928 (Stella?)

Cure 865
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 865 by replacing

"When proposed in this manner, the Proposer receives 2 Points.
The Speaker must mention this payment when e distributes the Proposal."

by

"When proposed in this manner, the Proposer receives 2 Points, at
the end of the Voting Period on that Proposal.
The Speaker must mention this payment when e distributes the Voting
results.

====

PROPOSAL 929 (Stella?)

Cure 866
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 866 by replacing

"When proposed in this manner, the Proposer receives 2 Points.
The Speaker must mention this payment when e distributes the Proposal."

by

"When proposed in this manner, the Proposer receives 2 Points, at
the end of the Voting Period on that Proposal.
The Speaker must mention this payment when e distributes the Voting
results.

====

PROPOSAL 930 (Stella?)

Players on Hold Eternally
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 870 by adding the paragraph:
A Player who is On Hold for a period longer than three months,
is deemed to have left the Game and shall be removed from the list of
Players. If the former Player re-enters the same Game, it shall be
with the same score as when e left and e shall not be considered a
new Player. Otherwise, e shall enter on the same terms as a new Player.

[Changes the status of a Player who seems to be On Hold eternally]

====

PROPOSAL 931 (Stella?)

Cure 725
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 725 by replacing

"On Friday Noon GMT 5% of the Points of Player X (with a minimum
of two Points) shall be transfered to the Player (or Players)
who holds Stock X."

by

"The Dividend on Stock X shall be 2 Points or 5% of the Points of
Player X on Friday Noon GMT (whatever is more).
The Dividend shall be transfered on Friday Noon GMT to the Player
(or Players) who holds Stock X."

[Cures an ambiguous phrase by something hopefully less ambiguous]

=====================

Proposal 932 (Garth)

Endangered Rules Act
(Creates a Rule)

The Ruleset must at all times clearly specify a way to Adopt Rule Changes.

If a Rule Change or set of Rule Changes would produce a Ruleset that does
not so specify, that Rule Change (or set thereof) is wholly void and 
without effect.

If disagreement exists as to whether such a Rule Change (or set thereof)
produces such a Ruleset, the Rule Changes in question shall be held in
abeyance until the matter is fully decided by whatever mechanism of
resolving disputes the Rules may provide.  If no such mechanism exists,
the Rule Changes in question shall be voided as provided above.

[ I intend to Transmute this once the bugs have been ironed out. ]

I have been informed that my last Phone Books and Group Report were
in error in that Jason, and not Oerjan, is now PROSIRUP Vizier and
Ordinancekeepor.  Here is a corrected version.

(You will note that Garth is still listed as Speaker--this is
my interpretation of Rules 402 and 785, and I have submitted
a CFJ to this effect.  I don't *like* it, but it's the only interpretation,
IMO, of those Rules.)

Call For Judgement 152

The Judge is    Nicol

Caller:         Chuck
Date:           Mon, 20 Jun 94 14:20:44 CST  

Barred Players: NONE

Judge:          Nicol
Date Assigned:  Mon Jun 20 15:32:23 EDT 1994

The Judgement:  

Scorekeepor:    


====================

The Statement:

I call for judgement on the following statement:

The Speaker is currently Garth.

Argument:

Look, I don't *like* it either, but I see no other interpretation of
the Rules.  Rule 785 does not take precedence over 402, and thus
the transfer of power as defined in Rule 402 must still take place
before Dave Bowen becomes Speaker.


Rule 402 (Mutable)
Transfer of Power of the Mighty Speaker

402.  Transfer of Power of the Mighty Speaker:

      When one Mighty Speaker is yielding his Office to another, the
      following procedure shall be followed:

       1) The Present Mighty Speaker shall forward copies of all
          necessary materials for the performance of his Office to the
          Prospective Mighty Speaker.
       2) The Prospective Mighty Speaker shall acknowledge the receipt
          of said materials.
       3) The Present Mighty Speaker shall post a message to the
          listserv announcing the official transfer of power, which
          occurs at the "Date:" of the Present Mighty Speaker's
          posting.

      The Present Mighty Speaker remains in Office until the successful
      completion of step 3.


Rule 785 (Mutable)
Abandonment of Speakerhood

785.  Improve Speaker Succession I

      If the Speaker has abandoned eir post, another new, Temporary
      Speaker is selected according to the "Rules of Succession", or
      if no such rules are defined, the other Player not on hold with
      the highest Score becomes the temporary Speaker.  This does not
      force the Game to be over in this case, and Scores are not reset
      to 0. The Game continues until a Player Wins, at which time a
      new Game is begun and the Winner becomes the real Speaker. The
      Temporary Speaker shall make reasonable effort to obtain the
      former Speaker's materials: proposal queue, voting records, etc.
      but if this is not possible, then the Temporary Speaker shall
      request that these be resubmitted by the Players. If a Speaker
      is replaced in this manner, e has eir score set to minus 2N
      Points immediately, where N is the number of Points required for
      a Player to Win the Game.

      Abandonment is determined as follows: If any Player suspects
      that the Speaker has Abandoned, e sends a message to all Players
      calling on the Speaker to announce eir presence.  The Speaker
      must reply to all Players within one week; if e does not, e is
      considered to have Abandoned.
      (*Was: 677*)

A thought has just occurred to me, and I'm unsure what the rules 
would say on this:

If I'm now the Vizier and OrdinanceKeepor of PROSIRUP, and all the 
other members of PROSIRUP are on hold (Oerjan, Duane) or apparently 
de-registered (Garth), does that mean that I can cast PROSIRUP's 
group vote in the current round of voting?

Or am I just having delusions of grandeur?

Opinions welcomed.  (I haven't tried to use / abuse this idea - yet).

Call For Judgement 152

The Judge is    Nicol

Caller:         Chuck
Date:           Mon, 20 Jun 94 14:20:44 CST  

Barred Players: NONE

Judge:          Nicol
Date Assigned:  Mon Jun 20 15:32:23 EDT 1994
Date Judged:    Mon, 20 Jun 1994 16:17:18 CST

The Judgement:  FALSE

Scorekeepor:    Player Nicol receives 5 points for Speedy Judgement

====================

The Statement:

I call for judgement on the following statement:

The Speaker is currently Garth.

Argument:

Look, I don't *like* it either, but I see no other interpretation of
the Rules.  Rule 785 does not take precedence over 402, and thus
the transfer of power as defined in Rule 402 must still take place
before Dave Bowen becomes Speaker.


Rule 402 (Mutable)
Transfer of Power of the Mighty Speaker

402.  Transfer of Power of the Mighty Speaker:

      When one Mighty Speaker is yielding his Office to another, the
      following procedure shall be followed:

       1) The Present Mighty Speaker shall forward copies of all
          necessary materials for the performance of his Office to the
          Prospective Mighty Speaker.
       2) The Prospective Mighty Speaker shall acknowledge the receipt
          of said materials.
       3) The Present Mighty Speaker shall post a message to the
          listserv announcing the official transfer of power, which
          occurs at the "Date:" of the Present Mighty Speaker's
          posting.

      The Present Mighty Speaker remains in Office until the successful
      completion of step 3.


Rule 785 (Mutable)
Abandonment of Speakerhood

785.  Improve Speaker Succession I

      If the Speaker has abandoned eir post, another new, Temporary
      Speaker is selected according to the "Rules of Succession", or
      if no such rules are defined, the other Player not on hold with
      the highest Score becomes the temporary Speaker.  This does not
      force the Game to be over in this case, and Scores are not reset
      to 0. The Game continues until a Player Wins, at which time a
      new Game is begun and the Winner becomes the real Speaker. The
      Temporary Speaker shall make reasonable effort to obtain the
      former Speaker's materials: proposal queue, voting records, etc.
      but if this is not possible, then the Temporary Speaker shall
      request that these be resubmitted by the Players. If a Speaker
      is replaced in this manner, e has eir score set to minus 2N
      Points immediately, where N is the number of Points required for
      a Player to Win the Game.

      Abandonment is determined as follows: If any Player suspects
      that the Speaker has Abandoned, e sends a message to all Players
      calling on the Speaker to announce eir presence.  The Speaker
      must reply to all Players within one week; if e does not, e is
      considered to have Abandoned.
      (*Was: 677*)

======================

The Judgement:

FALSE.  Yes, 402 is less than 785, but this is numeric relationship is 
meaningless because the situation of abandonment is not dealt with in
402.  402 only deals with the procedure to follow "when one Mighty 
Speaker is yielding his office to another" which is not now the case.
785 doesn't need a precedence claim over 402 because the situation it
covers, abandonment, is not covered by 402, so there is not a conflict.
  Students of coincidence will be amused to know that while I was typing 
in the previous sentence a driver of an automobile failed to yield below
my window, causing a breaking of headlamp glass.  Webster defines "yield"
as "to give up; surrender; submit."  Garth is not doing either of these
things, as he is nowhere to be found, and rule 785 is effectively stepping
in, as it was designed to do.

Well, I sent mail to the Speaker and to the Speaker pro-tem to remove me from
hold yesterday and haven't seen anything about it so....

I just came back to say that I don't really have time for eNomic anymore so
instead of staying On Hold indefinitely I will, as of this message, no longer
be playing eNomic.  Mr. Registrar please take note of this.

**********************

The Statement:

    "The Banker must still issue Mark Interest reports for the
    following dates: 2, 9, 16, 23 May, taking into account all Points
    to Mark conversions that happened since April 26"

**********************

The Judgement:

Ian judges this statement TRUE.

At the time it was made, this statement was certainly true. Since then, I
believe that Marks Interest reports have been made, but it is recommended
that the Bankor furnish any that are still in arrears.

Hi!

O Mighty Temporary Speaker, would you be so kind as to take me off hold?  
Sorry for the delay, but I was in a semi-comatose state for 24 hours

Proto-proposal XXX (Coren) (proto-proposed 6/21/94)
Link the Offices of Assistant and Distributor
(creates a rule)

XXX.	Distributor and Assistant Must Both Be Held by a Single Player.

	The offices of Distributor and Assistant must both be held by a 
	single player at all times.  If one office is vacant, it is
	assigned to the holder of the other.  If both offices are vacant,
	they will be assigned to the same player, as if a single office. 
	If the current holder gives up the offices, his successor must
	take both offices.  If held by different players, one chosen 
	randomly will surrender his office to the other.

	In all other ways, these two offices shall be treated seperately.

	This rule takes precedence over all other rules which would 
	require or allow these offices to be held by different players.

[Justification:  Oerjan is right about these two offices being closely 
related, I discovered while looking at them with an eye to taking them.  
It would be very difficult to pursue the duties of the Assistant without 
having the Distributor's access to the message base, the way things are 
currently set up.  I considered doing this as an amendment rather than a 
new rule, butthe rule regarding the Assistant and *all* the rules 
regarding the Distributor would need to be amended, to do it properly.  
This seemed to be the best way to do it.  Comments?  -  Coren]

Three Proto-Proposals.

The first one replaces the Point winning system by a system
based on Honour. The adoption of Proposals will gain you a little
Honour but more Honour may be gained or lost by earning so by
popular acclaim. Provides a good way of punishing Scams....

The second one, tries to cure the galoping Mark inflation, while
the third one aims to revive the dying Crime system.
Have fun!

======
Proto-PROPOSAL     (Stella?)
Honour
(Creates a Rule)
Let there be an entity called the Honourix.

Initially every Player holds ten Honouri. No Player shall have less
than zero Honouri. The number of Honouri held by each Player shall be
kept track of by the Scorekeepor and published at least weekly.

Once a week each Player may send a message to the Scorekeepor asking
to transfer 1 Honourix from one Player to another. E may not himself
be the receiving Player.

A Player who's Proposal is adopted shall receive 1 Honouri to be
taken randomly among the Active Players who ABSTAINed or voted AGAINST
that Proposal, or who did not bother to vote.

A Player who holds zero Honouri shall be known and addressed as
`Honourless Worm' and shall address Players with more Honour as
`Your Honour'.

A Player who holds more than twenty Honouri shall be known and
addressed as `Mighty Samourai' and may address Players with less
Honour in any way e sees fit.

A Mighty Samourai may `cash in eis Honour', by opting to become
Current Champion. However, such an honourless act will make eim
loose 20 Honouri.

[The latter phrase may be replaced by `opting to receive 1000 Points',
in the case of the Point Sucker Proposal being rejected.
The other two consequences of Honour are there just for the
fun of it.]

====
Proto-PROPOSAL     (Stella?)
Cure the Marks inflation in two steps
(Creates a Rule)

Upon passage of this Rule a number of Marks equal to the total number
Marks that the Bank is in debt, will be created and placed into the
Bank.

The number of Marks held by each Player shall be normalized in the
following way.
Let T be the total number of Marks held by Players, the Bank and other
Nomic entities. Let M be the number of Marks held by a given Player.
Let N be M*60/T. Then after normalization that Player shall have
N Marks, while M-N Marks shall be destroyed.

Whenever the total debt of the Bank is larger than 10 Marks, the
procedure described above shall be repeated.

[Cures the backlog of the Bank and cures the inflation.
The total number of Marks in circulation will be between 60 and 70
at all times.]

====
Proto-PROPOSAL     (Stella?)
Criminal Court
(Creates a Rule)

If a Player X commits the Crime descibed in Rule R, then the Clerk of
the Court shall Call for Judgment on a statement of the form:
"Player X committed the Crime described in Rule R" and e shall
accompagny this CFJ with arguments.
The whole procedure of such a CFJ, its subsequent Judgment and
possible Appeal shall be known as Criminal Court.
If the statement is judged TRUE player X shall be considered guilty of
the Crime and the appropriate penalty shall be applied.
[At the moment any Crime will go unpunished, unless a Player admits
to being Guilty. This Proposal tries to cure that.]

====
Greetings,
Stella?

Greetings one, greetings all. We have just registered as a Player, and
we would thus like to send a message to the Speaker. Unfortunately, we
are not yet sure who the Speaker is at this time, so we will use the
listserv to do so. 

We hereby Vote FOR all Proposals which are currently being Voted upon 
whose Proposal Numbers are even.

We hereby Vote AGAINST all Proposals which are currently being Voted
upon whose Proposal Numbers are odd. 

If we are correct, it is still within the Rules that to register as a Player,
one must simply *send* a message to the Registrar, which has just been sent.

We would also like to request that the Speaker pleas send us a copy of
all Proposals which are currently being Voted upon so that we may possibly
change our Votes if any of them are outstandingly good or bad.


On a different note, we would also like to beseech PROSIRUP to allow us
to join that esteemed Group, which we helped to co-found. If this is
acceptable, we would appreciate being notified ASAP of this fact so that
PROSIRUP will live on and prosper, as the oldest and most influential
Group in existance as of yet. 

Oh, and please note that Patent Titles are given to people, not Players...



And so it begins.....

Well, well, well, that prodigal son returneths!!!  Since Wes is back I think
I'll postpone my departure for a bit (hopefully I'll have enough warning to
deregister should I lose my account here).  The game was pretty lively when
Wes was around and probably will be yet again to make it worth my time.

Grei

p.s. Mr. Registrar please change my game name to Grei and leave me in the game.

			Thanks,

On closer examination, this is probably true.  I was worried about
having to rewrite all the distributor rules, too, which doesn't seem
to be the case; I also felt that suddenly halving the salary for the
newly combined position was a bit unfair, but that can be fixed, too.
 
So, submitted for your approval, the New Improved Proto-proposal:
 
 
Proto-proposal XXX (Coren) (proto-proposed 6/21/94; amended 6/22/94)
Combine the Offices of Assistant and Distributor
(amends a rule)
 
XXX. Distributor is Responsible for the Assistant Digests.
 
     The Distributor shall be responsible for collecting those
     messages which are official in nature from the Speaker and
     Officers. Messages are to be edited into a single digest post.
 
     The Distributor shall maintain previous digests and make them
     available upon request to any entity, including those Players on
     Hold.  This rule shall take precedence over all other Rules
     regarding communication with Players on Hold.
 
     The Distributor shall receive 3 points each Nomic Week for this
     duty, in addition to any other salary received.
 
     The office of Assistant is hereby abolished, and its duties are
     forthwith absorbed by the Distributor as outlined above.
     (*Was: 839*)
 
[Justification:  Oerjan is right about these two offices being
closely related, I discovered while looking at them with an eye to
taking them. It would be very difficult to pursue the duties of the
Assistant without having the Distributor's access to the message
base, the way things are currently set up.  I originally wrote this
up as a rule change, but was convinced that it could be done as an
amendment after all.  Do I need to put in the lines explicitly
abolishing the Assitant, or is that inherent in the amendment?  Also,
for the purposes of "short" rule and "long" rule, just which lines
get counted?  Is the heading counted?  The Semi-Official Rule Title?
The "former rule reference"?
 
Also, should I officially propose this one immediately, before the
Electioneer assigns the two offices seperately, somewhat complicating
matters?
 
Any further comments?  -  Coren]

Since *everybody*, including the one who originally pushed it through, 
seems to think that Rule #640 is extraneous, unnecessary, and confusing, 
let's get *rid* of the sucker!  <g>

Proto-proposal XXX (Coren) (proto-proposed 6/21/94)
Nuke Rule #640

As admitted in the message, we were still trying to acertain the current
situation. Abandonment of a Speaker is a horrible occurance... We still
believe that the Rules do not adequetly cover this sort of situation...

Actually, we lost Net access before the passage of Rule 815, but we did
attempt to send our message to register directly to you. Unfortunately,
it bounced. We are still trying to get a current Rule Set and Phone Book...

On the contrary. PROSIRUP began as a political party in the very beginnings
of the Game, formed by delphin (who later left to form gnomic). The Reform
Group may have gained official Group status first, but that is only due
to technicalities. PROSIRUP is by far the older organization... <grin>

Why thank you. We assume that Ronald Kunne won't throw a fit, as he usually
does when we try to do something, whether it be legal or not... <grumble>
Or has his personality changed as Stella?

So may we please have the Phone Book?

I have just sent a message to the Registrar informing em of my wish to cease
Watching and begin Playing. I would also like to make known to the current
members of PROSIRUP, whomsoever they be, my wish to be admitted to their
esteemed Group, as I certainly would not want to see a Group with such
venerable and public-spirited aims go out of existence due to falling
Membership. I hope my application meets with eir approval.

Score report 16/6-23/6
======================

Note: I list Vlad as On Hold (since May 5 actually, but nobody disputed
previous score reports), but what I took as being his On Hold message
is rather vague. However, the alternative is that he has to be deregistered
by Rule 460, as no sign of life was heard since May 5.

The current scores are at the end.

Call For Judgement 153

The Judge is    Lance

The Judgement:

Scorekeepor: 

-----------------

The Statement

I would like to have legal guidance on the statement:

"Vlad is On Hold since May 5."

Arguments:
My principle argument is a message Vlad sent to the server on May 5.
I construed this message as an On Hold message, although no confirmation
from the Speaker followed (as required by Rule 870). However, it may
be noted that Alice was in a similar situation. She claims to have
send Garth an On Hold message, also in the beginning of May, which
was never properly relayed.

The second argument is the score report of June 10. Nobody disputed
this score report, although it already lists Vlad as being On Hold.
Hence, by Rule 463, this score report is now considered to reflect
the true scores.

The third argument is that Vlad's account seems to have been deleted.
(He does predict this in his message, by the way.) Consequently no sign
of life was heard of him, since May 5. This implies that he was to be
deregistered on May 19 (by Rule 460), *unless* he is actually On Hold.

------------------

The Judgement:

    I judge this statement to be TRUE.

Arguments:

    In eis message dated 5 May 94, Vlad did inform the subscribers of
    the listserv (including the then Speaker) of eis intention to go
    On Hold.

    Rule 815 has no bearing here because the Speaker is not an
    Officer.   This is evidenced by simple examination of the Blue
    pages of the Phonebook and by Rule 676 which specifies the Blue
    pages.

    Therefor a message to the listserv is sufficient because the
    Speaker was subscribed to the listserv at the time of the message.

References:

Rule 815 (Mutable)
Send Stuff Directly to Officers

815.  Proper Distribution

      Let all messages, information, requests, statements, CFJs,
      answers, etc. that Rules indicate are to be sent or delivered to

As I pointed out in a private message to Stella?, I believe that
Vlad's message was *not* a request to go on hold.  However, it
does seem that Vlad should be deregistered.  And in either case
(Vlad on Hold or Vlad deregistered) the Reform Group has ceased to
exist. (I can't say I'm terribly sad to see it go.)  If either
of these are in error, please let me know.  (I will, of course,
abide by the results of the currently pending CFJ.)  Apparently
Wes was right after all: PROSIRUP *is* the oldest Group!

I will be posting the Ruleset tonight.

Stella? has pointed out to me that Vlad, not being On Hold, has
not posted a message, cast a Vote, etc. in well over 2 weeks.
Thus, he should be deregistered. If someone knows that he *has*
posted a message etc. in that time let me know.  Otherwise I
will deregister him.

Furthermore, I believe this means that the Reform Group must be
disbanded.  The Reform Group Ordinances do not specify a Vizier
except for Vlad.  Default Rules indicate that the Vizier shall
be the player who first submitted the application to the Registrar,
and I believe this was Vlad as well.

Comments?

Registrar Chuck

I would first like to apologize if the language in this message conflicts with
any Nomic rules.  Unfortunately, I lack any copy of the rules and have received
none in the past two weeks of watching this list.

I would address this message to the appropriate officer, however I am not
knowledgeable concerning the various offices (having no ruleset) and also have
no list of e-mail addresses of Nomic players.

I have the intention of joining this game of Nomic once I have the opportunity
to understand the current state of the game and the proper procedure for
becoming registered.  Therefore, I request that the appropriate officer send me
a copy of the current ruleset, list of e-mail addresses, and any other
pertinent documents, unless said documents will be mailed out to all members of
this mailing list in the near future.

My name is David Alpert and my address is collins@powdml.enet.dec.com

Thank you very much.

Status: OR

THE CURRENT RULESET
Part 1 of 6 

Rules are listed as follows, where NNN represents the Rule number:

========================================

Rule NNN (Immutable or Mutable)
My Own Unofficial Title

NNN.  Semi-Official Rule Title, If There Is One

      Text of Rule

Annotation: Some Rules are annotated as required by Rule 789.
These annotations "shall guide the interpretation
of that Rule."
Relevant Rules: Such annotations include a list of relevant Rules.

[Note: Some Rules are annotated by me to clarify their interpretation.
Unlike the official annotations, these are enclosed in brackets.
These annotations have no legal force in and of themselves.]

========================================



========================================

Rule 101 (Immutable)
Obey the Rules

101.

      All Players must always abide by all the Rules then in effect,
      in the form in which they are then in effect.  The Rules in the
      Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the first game.
      The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (Immutable) and
      201-219 (Mutable).

========================================

Rule 102 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Rules

102.

      Initially Rules in the 100's are Immutable and Rules in the
      200's are Mutable.  Rules subsequently Enacted or Transmuted
      (that is, changed from Immutable to Mutable or vice versa) may
      be Immutable or Mutable regardless of their Numbers, and Rules
      in the Initial Set may be Transmuted regardless of their Numbers.

========================================

Rule 103 (Immutable)
The Speaker and Voters

103.

      At any time, each Player shall be either a Voter or the Speaker;
      no Player may simultaneously be a Voter and a Speaker. At any
      time, there shall be exactly one Speaker. The term "Player" in
      the Rules shall specifically include both the Voters and the
      Speaker.

========================================

Rule 104 (Immutable)
First Speaker

104.

      The Speaker for the first game shall be Michael Norrish.

========================================

Rule 105 (Immutable)
What Is a Rule Change?

105.

      A Rule Change is any of the following:  (1) the enactment,
      repeal, or amendment of a mutable Rule; or (2) the transmutation
      of an immutable Rule into a mutable Rule or vice versa.
        (Note:  This definition implies that, at least initially, all
      new Rules are Mutable; Immutable Rules, as long as they are
      Immutable, may not be Amended or Repealed; Mutable Rules, as long
      as they are Mutable, may be Amended or Repealed; any Rule of any
      status may be Transmuted; no Rule is absolutely immune to change.)

========================================

Rule 106 (Immutable)
Adopting Proposed Rule Changes

106.

      All Rule Changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on.
      They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required
      number of votes and Quorum is achieved.

========================================

Rule 107 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Must Be Written Down

107.

      Any proposed Rule Change must be written down (or otherwise
      communicated in print media) before it is voted on. If adopted,
      it must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.

========================================

Rule 108 (Immutable)
When May Rule Changes Take Effect?

108.

      No Rule Change may take effect earlier than the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording
      explicitly states otherwise.  No rule change may have retroactive
      application.

========================================

Rule 109 (Immutable)
Rule Numbers

109.

      The Speaker shall give each proposed Rule Change a Number for
      reference.  The numbers shall begin with 301, and each Rule
      Change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next
      successive integer, whether or not the Proposal is adopted.
        If a Rule is Repealed and Reenacted, it receives the Number of
      the Proposal to Reenact it.  If a Rule is Amended or Transmuted,
      it receives the Number of the Proposal to Amend or Transmute it.
 
========================================

Rule 110 (Immutable)
Transmutation of Rules

110.

      Rule Changes that Transmute Immutable Rules into Mutable Rules
      may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among Votes
      legally cast.  Transmutation shall not be implied, but must be
      stated explicitly in a Proposal to take effect.
 
========================================

Rule 111 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Conflicts

111.

      In a conflict between a Mutable and an Immutable Rule, the
      immutable Rule takes precedence and the Mutable Rule shall be
      entirely void.  For the purposes of this Rule a Proposal to
      Transmute an Immutable Rule does not "conflict" with that
      Immutable Rule.
 
========================================

Rule 112 (Immutable)
Winning Must Be by Points

112.

      The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered
      from achieving n points to any other state of affairs.  The
      magnitude of n and the means of earning points may be changed,
      and Rules that establish a Winner when play cannot continue may
      be Enacted and (while they are mutable) be Amended or Repealed.
 
========================================

Rule 113 (Immutable)
Players May Always Forfeit

113.

      A Player always has the option to forfeit the Game rather than
      continue to play or incur a Game penalty.  No penalty worse than
      losing, in the judgment of the Player to incur it, may be
      imposed.

========================================

Rule 114 (Immutable)
At Least One Mutable Rule

114.

      There must always be at least one Mutable Rule.  The adoption of
      Rule Changes must never become completely inpermissible.

========================================

Rule 115 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Which Change Rule-Changing Rules Allowed

115.

      Rule Changes that affect Rules needed to allow or apply
      Rule Changes are as permissible as other Rule Changes.  Even
      Rule Changes that amend or repeal their own authority are
      permissible.  No Rule Change or type of move is impermissible
      solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a
      Rule.

========================================

Rule 116 (Immutable)
Permissibility of the Unprohibited

116.

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
      and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
      which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly or
      implicitly permits it.

========================================

Rule 206 (Mutable)
One Voter, One Vote

206.

      Each Voter has exactly one Vote.  The Speaker may not Vote.

========================================

Rule 208 (Mutable)
End of the Voting Period

208.

      At the end of the prescribed Voting Period on a Proposal, the
      Speaker shall reveal all Votes legally cast on that Proposal. If
      the Speaker's consent may be required for a Proposal to be
      adopted then the Speaker should indicate at that time whether or
      not e gives eir consent.  If the Speaker does not explicitly
      indicate that e refuses to consent to the Proposal, it shall be
      assumed that e consents.

========================================

Rule 212 (Mutable)
Resolving Rule Conflicts

212.

      If two or more Mutable Rules conflict with one another, or if
      two or more Immutable Rules conflict with one another, then the
      Rule with the lowest ordinal Number takes precedence.
        If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of rule) or takes
      precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.
        If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

========================================

Rule 217 (Mutable)
Judgements Must Accord with the Rules

217.

      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however, if
      the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the Statement
      to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider Game Custom and the
      Spirit of the Game before applying other standards.

========================================

Rule 312 (Mutable)
A Point for Voting

312.

      If a Voter votes, he gets one (1) point at the end of the Voting
      Period.

========================================

Rule 376 (Mutable)
When Does a Rule Change Take Effect?

376.  Time that a rule change takes effect:

      An adopted rule change takes full effect at the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it.
      The moment of the completion of the vote is defined by the date
      and time given in the line starting with "Date:" of the Nomic
      listserver message send by the Benevolent Speaker, announcing
      the result of the vote on the corresponding proposal.

========================================

Rule 388 (Mutable)
Game Status When a New Game Begins

388.  Starting a new Game:

      Whenever a new game of Nomic is begun, the status of the new
      Game when it begins shall be the same as the status of the old
      Game when it ended, in all respects where the Rules do not
      decide otherwise.

========================================

Rule 399 (Mutable)
The Office of the Rulekeepor

399.  The Office of the Rulekeepor:

      Let there be an Officer known as the Rulekeepor.
      The Rulekeepor shall maintain a complete list of the current
      Rules, and post this list to all Players at least once a week.
      
      So long as the Rulekeepor is in Office, the Speaker is not
      required to maintain or distribute the Rules.

========================================

Rule 402 (Mutable)
Transfer of Power of the Mighty Speaker

402.  Transfer of Power of the Mighty Speaker:

      When one Mighty Speaker is yielding his Office to another, the
      following procedure shall be followed:
      
       1) The Present Mighty Speaker shall forward copies of all
          necessary materials for the performance of his Office to the
          Prospective Mighty Speaker.
       2) The Prospective Mighty Speaker shall acknowledge the receipt
          of said materials.
       3) The Present Mighty Speaker shall post a message to the
          listserv announcing the official transfer of power, which
          occurs at the "Date:" of the Present Mighty Speaker's
          posting.
      
      The Present Mighty Speaker remains in Office until the successful
      completion of step 3.

========================================

Rule 404 (Mutable)
Legality of Proposals

404.  Legality of Proposals:

      As long as a Proposal satisfies all requirements in place at the
      time of its making for the proper making of Proposals, the act
      of making such a Proposal is legal regardless of its content.
      It is legal to propose a Rule which conflicts with other Rules
      or with itself, which is paradoxical, or which cannot be
      applied.

========================================

Rule 407 (Mutable)
Invoking Judgement

407.  Clerk of the Courts, Part II: Invoking Judgement:

      If Players disagree about the legality of a Move or the
      interpretation or application of a Rule, then a Player may
      invoke Judgement by submitting a Statement for Judgement to the
      Clerk of the Courts.  Disagreement, for the purposes of this
      Rule, may be created by the insistence of any Player.  When
      Judgement is invoked, the Clerk of the Courts must, as soon as
      possible, select a Judge as described in the Rules.  The Clerk
      of the Courts must then distribute the Statement to be judged,
      along with the identity of the Judge, to all Players.

========================================

Rule 408 (Mutable)
Accepting Judge-ship

408.  Clerk of the Courts, Part III: Accepting Judge-ship:

      After the Clerk of the Courts has distributed the Statement to
      be judged and the identity of the Judge, the Judge has one week
      in which to deliver a legal Judgement.  If the Judge fails to
      deliver a Judgement within this time, e is penalized 10 points
      and a new Judge is selected.  A Judgement is delivered by
      submitting that Judgement to the Clerk of the Courts, who must
      then distribute that Judgement to all Players as soon as
      possible.

========================================

Rule 413 (Mutable)
Winning by Paradox

413.  Winning By Paradox:

      If the Rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or
      if the legality of some action cannot be determined with
      finality, or if some action appears equally legal and illegal,
      then a player may Call For Judgement on a Statement to that
      effect.  If the Statement is judged TRUE, then the same Judge
      who judged the Statement TRUE must declare the most recent
      passed Proposal X such that the Statement was not TRUE before
      the passage of Proposal X, or declare that there is no such
      Proposal.  (Until the Judge does this, the Judgment is not
      valid.)  If the Judgement of TRUE is not overruled, then the
      Player who called for Judgement is declared the Winner of the
      game.
      
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared that
      there is no such Proposal X, the game is ended, with no
      provisions for restarting it.
      
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared such
      a Proposal X, the following actions are taken:
         - all Players remain active,
         - all Proposals curently being Voted upon are removed from
           consideration for Voting,
         - the scores for all Players are set to 0 (zero),
         - the Rules and explicit game custom are reverted to the
           state they were in before Proposal X was passed,
         - a Benevolent Speaker for the next Game is chosen:
              -If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the
               Benevolent Speaker, and the old Benevolent Speaker
               becomes a Voter,
              -If there is more than one Winner, the Benevolent
               Speaker randomly selects one of the Winners, who
               becomes the new Benevolent Speaker, and the old
               Benevolent Speaker becomes a Voter,
         - and a new Game is begun.

========================================

Rule 415 (Mutable)
How To Submit a Proposal

415.  "How a Proposal is Submitted":

      A Proposal by a Voter shall be made by submitting it to the
      Mighty Speaker. As soon as possible after receiving the
      Proposal, the Mighty Speaker shall assign the Proposal a Number
      and distribute the Proposal along with its number to all
      Players.
      
      The Mighty Speaker may also make Proposals. The Mighty Speaker
      must process all pending Voter-submitted Proposals first, and

========================================

Rule 417 (Mutable)
The Nomic Archivist

417.  Establishment of the Office of Archivist:

      That there be established an office known as the Nomic
      Archivist, which shall be governed by the default Rules
      concerning official posts. The initial duties of the Nomic
      Archivist shall be to record the passage and failure of
      Proposals, to maintain a "historical record" (defined below)
      of the Ruleset, to maintain a list of Judgements and their case
      histories, and to maintain a list of game Winners in past games.
      The Archivist is free to comment on the historical records as
      they see fit, but such commentary must be clearly delimited
      from the historical material. Where the material being stored
      does not already admit a classification method, the Archivist
      is free to design one themselves.

      The "historical record" of the Ruleset maintained by the
      Archivist is one that includes all rules ever part of the nomic
      Ruleset, annotated with information as to their ultimate fate,
      whether Repealed or Amended etc. This record of the Ruleset has
      no legal force.

      The duties required of the Archivist may be changed with their
      consent and at the request of the Office's controlling body
      (whatsoever that may be). Initially, the controlling body of
      this Office shall be all Players, and any request to change the
      duties must therefore be supported by a majority of Players
      "speaking" to the request.  Naturally, default Rules for
      Offices may establish a different controlling body for this
      Office.
      
      The salary of the Archivist office shall be determined by its
      controlling body. Initially, its salary shall be 5 points and
      one coin of the office-holder's group per week.
      
      The initial office-holder for this post shall be Michael
      Norrish.

========================================

Rule 434 (Mutable)
Game May Be Won By CFJ

434.  Judgement Required to Win (and Timing of Win):

      If a Player believes that he has won the Game, he may submit a
      CFJ to that effect.  If it is returned with the Judgement TRUE
      (and that Judgement is not Appealed), then he has won the Game
      as of the delivery of that Judgement.  If the Judgement is TRUE,
      but is Appealed, but is sustained (and no Proposal to reverse
      the verdict is made), then he has won the Game as of the
      delivery of the Appeal verdict.  If such a verdict is sustained,
      challenged by Proposal, but the Proposal does not pass, he has
      won the Game as of the completion of the Vote on that Proposal.

      Judgement on a CFJ to win the Game may *not* be delivered until
      at least 72 hours after its official announcement, in order to
      give time for the Judge to accept input from the community.

      This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which specifies
      the exact moment at which a Game is won.

[Note: Implicit Game Custom dictates that, despite the title,
this rule does not *require* a CFJ in order to win the game.]

========================================

Rule 450 (Mutable)
Game Entities May Not Be Arbitrarily Changed

450.  Game Entities may not be Arbitrarily Changed:

      Any Entity which is created by the Nomic Rules, and which exists only
      within the context of the current Game of Nomic, such as Points,
      Votes, etc. may *not* be changed by any action other than those
      specified by the Rules.

========================================

Rule 451 (Mutable)
Determination of Judgement--Timing

451.  Timing of CFJ Results:

      When a CFJ makes a Statement about the current state of the
      Game, the result of that CFJ shall be TRUE if and only if the
      Judge feels that that Statement was correct at the time that the
      CFJ was *issued*. Any changes that have happened in the time
      between the issuing of the CFJ and its delivery must be figured
      in to find the correct current state.

========================================

Rule 452 (Mutable)
Prohibition of Electioneering by the Mighty Speaker

452.  Prohibition of Electioneering by the Mighty Speaker:

      The Speaker may not use eis knowledge of the current status of a
      vote on a Proposal in an attempt to influence the result of the
      Vote on that Proposal. Violations of this Rule shall be
      considered a Class C Crime.

========================================

Rule 455 (Mutable)
Penalty for Improper or Lacking Declarations

455.  Further Declaration Rules:

      Any Player who submits a Proposal which does not include a
      Declaration, as described in other legislation, shall be guilty
      of a Class C Crime.  Any Player who submits a Proposal which
      includes a Declaration which has not been approved by
      legislation shall be guilty of a Class A Crime.

      The number of each type of Currency owned by each player or

      which specifies a Recordkeepor for that Currency, then the

          - clearly allege that a specific Move is illegal;
          - clearly allege that a specific Rule is illegal or lacking

========================================

Rule 663 (Mutable)
Injunctions--General

663.  General Rules For Injunctions

      There shall be an entity known as an Injunction, which may
      accompany certain Judgements of TRUE or FALSE as provided in the
      rules. An Injunction is a statement or series of statements
      specifying an action or actions which must take place. If a
      Judgement is is accompanied by an Injunction, that Injunction
      must be published with the Judgement. All players must abide by
      the Injunction beginning no later than 72 hours after its
      publication unless one of the following conditions then apply:
        - The Judgement which the Injunction accompanies is undergoing
          appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of the appeal
          process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but a proposal
          has been published which would overturn that decision if
          passed, and said proposal has not failed.
        - The validity of the Injunction itself is questioned by a
          pending CFJ.
        - A Judgement upholding the validity of the Injunction is
          undergoing appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of
          the appeal process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but
          a proposal has been published which would overturn that
          decision if passed, and said proposal has not failed.

      A Judgement may not be accompanied by an Injunction unless it is
      specifically permitted elsewhere in the rules. An Injunction
      must be completely consistent with all rules in effect at the
      time of issuance, and must be completely relevant to the matter
      addressed in the corresponding judgement.

      If any Player believes that an Injunction or any part of it does
      not meet the criteria for a valid Injunction, e may submit a CFJ
      to that effect. If the resulting Judgement supports the
      contention that the criteria are not met, the Injunction shall
      be considered illegal and shall have no legal force.

      This rule takes precedence over all rules governing Injunctions.

========================================

Rule 664 (Mutable)
Illegal Injuctions are Crimes

      Judgement supports the allegation, the Judge may include with
      the Judgement an Injunction specifying that the move is to be
      retracted, and any resulting adjustments to the published game
      state. The adjustments to the game state must have been
      unambiguously specified within the CFJ, and these adjustments
      must only undo actions which were a direct or indirect result of
      that Move.

========================================

Rule 669 (Mutable)
To Disobey an Injunction is Criminal

669.  Contempt of Court

      If the rules require a Player to obey an Injunction and e fails
      to do so, then a Criminal Court may find that Player GUILTY of a

      asked if e wants the Office, and if not, a new one shall be
      selected in the same manner.

Rule 724 (Mutable)
Winning the Game

724.  Requirements for Winning

      The Winner is the first Voter to achieve sufficiently many
      Points.  The minimum number of Points required for Player X to
      win is 10*N*(1+G/6), where N is the number of Players currently
      registered in the Game, and G is the number of Games which
      Player X has already won.  If more than one Voter achieves this
      condition simultaneously, then all such Voters win.  When a Game
      ends in this manner:
        - If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the new
          Speaker and the old Speaker becomes a Voter.
        - If there is more than one Winner, the Voter with the highest Point 
          total becomes the new Speaker.  If more than one Voter is
          tied for the highest score, the old Speaker randomly selects
          one of them to become the new Speaker.  The old Speaker
          becomes a voter.
        - All Player's scores are reset to 0.
        - A new Game is begun.  All Rules and Proposals retain the
          status they had at the end of the old Game.

      (either alone or acting together on the same Stock) in a message
      to the server.  No bid shall be made, which can not be covered
      by the Marks in  he bidders Bank account (to be verified by the
      Banker.)

      After one week each of the Stocks shall be transfered from the
      Bank to the highest bidder. If two or more bids for Stock X are
      exactly equal, the Stock shall go to player X (if one of the
      highest bidders), or to the Player with the lowest score.

      If a given Stock X is bought by Player X, the Marks of the bid
      shall be transfered from Player X to the Bank.
      If a given Stock X is bought by another Player (or Players) then
      Player X, the Marks of the bid shall go from this Player(s) to
      Player X.

      The Banker shall keep track of the Stocks held by each Player.

The Marxist

736.  The Marxist

      Let there be the Patent Title known as "Marxist", which is
      awarded to the Player with the most Marks, or if tied, to the
      Players with the most Marks. Only the current richest Player
      or Players may hold this title.

      The determination and announcement of assignment and revoking
      of the Title is made by the Banker, who must use the most
      accurate means of determining this available to eim, and must
      make the announcement as soon as possible after becoming aware
      of a change in holder of the Title.

      However: To respect some Players' wish for privacy, and in
      view of the secret nature of Marks accounts, a prospective
      Marxist must first be asked if e wants the Title. If not, then
      instead of announcing, "Player x is granted the Patent Title of
      'Marxist', e announces, "Patent Title of 'Marxist' is granted
       to an anonymous Player".

      Quantity is given to an Entity, and no Rule states where that
      Conserved Quantity is to be taken from, then the transfer shall
      not take place. If a Conserved Quantity is taken from an Entity,

      If a Player Wins a Game despite a handicap factor X, then that
      Player shall instead receive the Patent Title "Champion*X",

      Once the identity of the Auctioneer is determined, the Auction
      begins with the Auctioneer making an announcement to the game
      forum stating what  Nomic entity is up for Auction, and that e
      is accepting bids.
 
      Players who wish to participate in the Auction then must
      indicate their interest by sending a bid to the Auctioneer.

Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal

761.  Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal: Adjusting for Abstentions

      When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the Votes which
      have been legally cast shall be counted by the Speaker. If a
      Proposal is not Contested, and there are more FOR votes cast
      then AGAINST votes, then that Proposal shall take effect.  If
      such a Proposal has an equal number of FOR and AGAINST Votes,
      then the Speaker shall decide whether the Proposal shall be
      Adopted, or if that Proposal shall fail. If the Proposal is
      Contested, and the number of FOR votes cast is at least twice
      the number of AGAINST votes cast, then that Proposal shall take
      effect.

      If a Rule will change the actions required of or forbidden to
      the Speaker, and the Speaker opposed the Proposal, then that
      Proposal shall be considered Contested. The Speaker shall

      downwards, shall be transferred to Player X, where N is the
      number of Members of Group Y immediately before Player X ceased
      to be a Member of Group Y.  This transfer is not taxable, and

Rule 764 (Mutable)
Mischief

764.  Mischief

      Any Player or Group X may perform an Act of Mischief directed
      at any Player or Group Y.  The permissible forms of Mischief
      are defined in other Rules; such definitions must include a 
      positive Price in Coins, or the form of Mischief is not
      permissible.  This Rule explicitly takes precedence over all
      other Rules which purport to determine which forms of Mischief
      are permissible.

      To cause an Act of Mischief,  X  sends to the Public Forum a
      message containing:
      - the Name of the object, Y;
      - the effect of the Act of Mischief;
      - the Number of the Rule which permits the form of Mischief;
      - indication of which Coins in X's account will be used as
      payment for the Act of Mischief.  Coins of Group Y, or the
      Group to which Player Y belongs, may not be used as payment.  

      The effect of the Act of Mischief is applied immediately upon 
      publication of the above message in the Forum.  An additional
      effect of this Act of Mischief is that
      - for each Coin of Group Z spent as payment above, two Points
      are removed from the Z Treasury;
      - the Coins used as payment above are removed from X's account
      and destroyed.

Rule 766 (Mutable)
Groups

766.  Amend Rule 714.

      A Group is initially formed by a set of Players which has
      registered with the Registrar to form a Group; other Players may
      join later.  Each Group has a Name, a Membership, a Vizier,
      an Ordinancekeepor, a Treasury, an Initial Set of Ordinances,
      and an associated form of Currency, called the <name> Coins,
      where <name> is the Name of the Group.

      1.  The Name may not be the Name of another Group.

      2.  The Membership is a set of Players;  these Players are
      Members of the Group, and all other Players are not.

      3.  Synchronously with the registration of a Group, two Offices
      are created known as the <name> Vizier, and the <name>
      Ordinancekeepor, where <name> is the Name of the Group.
      These Offices may never be empty, and the <name> Vizier and
      <name> Ordinancekeepor must both be a member of <name> Group.
      The <name> Vizier shall inform the Registrar whenever the
      Membership or the Ordinancekeepor of the <name> group changes.
      When the <name> Vizier changes, the new Vizier shall inform the
      Registrar of the change.
      The <name> Ordinancekeepor shall keep an accurate and current
      record of the Ordinances of the <name> Group.

      4.  The Treasury is a repository for Points and Currencies and
      has the same capabilities for holding, trading, and spending
      Points and Currencies as does a Player.

      5.  The Ordinances are a description of the operation of the
      Group.

      6.  The <name> Coins are a form of Currency which is created
      synchronously with the registration of the Group.  The <name>
      Group may create <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be
      placed in the <name> Treasury.  The <name> Group may destroy
      <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be removed from the
      <name> Treasury.

      If a Group has N Members then it has N Votes for each
      Proposal in addition to those of its Membership.  The
      Ordinances of a Group may determine how and when the Group
      casts its Votes; if the Ordinances are silent on this issue
      then the Group may not cast its Votes.  The Votes of the
      Group are cast when the Vizier sends a message to the Speaker
      to that effect during the Voting Period and this action is
      legitimate insofar as the Ordinances are concerned.

      When a Player submits a Proposal, e may pay one Mark to the Bank

      E must inform both the Banker and the Speaker when doing so.
      A Proposal which has Sanity imposed upon it is known as a Sane
      Proposal.  The Speaker shall, when e distributes a Sane
      Proposal, inform the Players that it is a Sane Proposal.

      No non-Voter Nomic entity may Vote on a Sane Proposal.  Each
      Voter shall have exactly one Vote on a Sane Proposal, and
      each Voter's Vote shall be counted exactly once on a Sane
      Proposal.

      This rule takes precedence over any rule allowing a non-Voter
      Nomic entity to Vote; over any rule which gives any Voter
      more or less than one Vote on a proposal; and over any
      rule which would cause any Voter's Vote to be counted more or

Abandonment of Speakerhood

785.  Improve Speaker Succession I

      If the Speaker has abandoned eir post, another new, Temporary
      Speaker is selected according to the "Rules of Succession", or
      if no such rules are defined, the other Player not on hold with
      the highest Score becomes the temporary Speaker.  This does not
      force the Game to be over in this case, and Scores are not reset
      to 0. The Game continues until a Player Wins, at which time a
      new Game is begun and the Winner becomes the real Speaker. The
      Temporary Speaker shall make reasonable effort to obtain the
      former Speaker's materials: proposal queue, voting records, etc.
      but if this is not possible, then the Temporary Speaker shall
      request that these be resubmitted by the Players. If a Speaker
      is replaced in this manner, e has eir score set to minus 2N
      Points immediately, where N is the number of Points required for
      a Player to Win the Game.

      Abandonment is determined as follows: If any Player suspects
      that the Speaker has Abandoned, e sends a message to all Players
      calling on the Speaker to announce eir presence.  The Speaker
      must reply to all Players within one week; if e does not, e is

      interpreted in a certain way, e shall also submit a list of
      Rules relevant to that CFJ, which must include the Rule in
      question.  If the statement is Judged TRUE, the Judge may
      include with the Judgement an Injuction requiring the Rulekeepor

      and the list of relevant Rules.

      The annotation shall remain only until one of the Rules
      in the list of relevant Rules is amended, repealed, or
      transmuted; or until a CFJ determines that the injunction no
      longer applies, as described below.  While it remains, it shall
      guide the application of that Rule.

      If a Player believes that the circumstances which led to the
      Judgement no longer prevail and the annotation is therefore no

      Player has been found Not Guilty of breaking the Rule or

      Decrees to Appeal Judgements.

      The Ambassador shall maintain a current record of all Foreign

Rule 901 (Mutable)
The Scorekeepor

901.  The Office of Scorekeepor

      There shall exist an Office known as Scorekeepor. The
      Scorekeepor is responsible for maintaining a list of the Point
      Scores of all current Players and other Game Entities, making
      such a list available on request as well as posting it at least
      once a Week, and for notifying Players in the event of a Win on
      Points. E must abide by all Rules governing Scoring, but in
      cases where the Rules are unclear or contradictory is to use eir
      best judgement in determining Scores.

      The Scorekeepor is chiefly a tabulator of Point changes posted
      by others. E is only Legally Responsible for tabulating those
      classes of Point changes where Rules specifically bestow Legal
      Responsibility upon the Scorekeepor.

Rule 902 (Mutable)
Salary of the Scorekeepor

902.  Scorekeepor Salary

      The Salary of the Scorekeepor is 5 Points per Week.

========================================

Rule 903 (Mutable)
Point Changes which the Scorekeepor Must Record

903.  Point Changes Automatically Applied by the Scorekeepor, Part 1 

      Classes of Point changes which the Scorekeepor is Legally
      Responsible for detecting and tabulating without a specific
      request by another Player include, but are not necessarily
      limited to the following:

      * Salaries which consist of a fixed Point award per Week.

      * Transfers of Points specifically requested by the owner of the
      Points in a message received by the Scorekeepor.

      * Transfers of Points from a Group Treasury specifically
      requested by the Vizier of that Group in a message received by
      the Scorekeepor; however, the Vizier is legally responsible for
      ensuring that such a Point transfer is consistent with eir
      Group's Ordinances.

      * Point changes resulting from end of Game adjustments.

      * Point rounding, taxation and "Welfare", if mandated by other
      Rules.

      * Point changes resulting from a Player joining or leaving the
      Game.

      * Point changes resulting from dissolution of a Group.

      * Point changes resulting from a premature transfer of
      Speakership.

      The Scorekeepor is Legally Responsible for ensuring that the
      above Point changes are performed according to all Rules.

      Additional classes of Point changes which are the Scorekeepor's
      Legal Responsibility may be defined by other Rules.

========================================

Rule 905 (Mutable)
No Point Changes if No One Reports Them

905.  Point Changes With Legal Responsibility Unspecified

      If a Rule mandates a change in Points, but no Rules exist which
      define the Player Legally Responsible for detecting and
      reporting the change to the Scorekeepor, then the Point change
      is cancelled.

      This Rule takes precedence over all other Rules governing
      changes in Points, to the extent permitted.

========================================

Rule 906 (Mutable)
Who's Responsible for Point Changes

906.  Point Changes Requested By Other Players, Part 1

      The Legal Responsibility for detecting the following classes of
      Point changes and reporting them to the Scorekeepor is bestowed
      upon another Player:

      * All Point changes directly related to the submission of
      Proposals: responsibility of Speaker, who must report these no
      later than the message announcing the voting results.

      * All Point changes directly related to voting on Proposals:
      responsibility of Speaker, who must report these no later than
      the message announcing the voting results.

      * All point changes resulting from Vototron contributions:
      responsibility of Speaker, who must report these no later than
      the message announcing the voting results.

      * All point changes resulting from fees for judgements, salaries
      and penalties given to judges: responsibility of Clerk of the
      Courts, who must report these as soon as possible, and no later
      than the message announcing the outcome of the judgement.

      * Electioneer per-position-filled salary: responsibility of
      Electioneer to notify Scorekeepor within one Week.

      * Point changes regarding the "Squealer/Ninny" Rule: If the
      Ninny must lose Points, the responsibility lies with the
      Squealer for informing the Scorekeepor as soon as possible.

      * Marks interest: responsibility of Banker to nofify Scorekeepor
      as soon as possible following the mandated interst payment.

      * Proposal lottery: responsibility of Sweepstakes Officer, who
      must notify Scorekeepor as soon as possible after the drawing.

      * Ambassador salary: responsibility of Ambassador for notifying
      Scorekeepor no later than one Week following the time the
      payment is earned.

      * Stock dividends: responsibility of the Banker for notifying
      Scorekeepor no later than one Week following the time the
      dividends are earned.

      The Scorekeepor notification must be via the public forum or, if
      individually subscribable distribution lists are implemented,
      must be made on a distribution list which is potentially
      available to anyone who wishes to subscribe to it.  This
      paragraph takes precendence over other Rules which would require
      a private Scorekeepor notification. The notification need not be
      on a separate message, as long as the Scorekeepor is mentioned,
      and the message is on a list which is received by the
      Scorekeepor.

      Other classes of Point changes whose legal responsibilty for
      reporting is other than the Scorekeepor may be defined by other
      Rules.

========================================

Rule 907 (Mutable)
Definition of "As Soon As Possible"

907.

      Whenever a Player is required to perform a certain action "as
      soon as possible", e is required to perform this action before
      performing any other actions which have a less strictly defined
      time requirement.  However, activity of a purely discussionary
      nature is excluded from the ordering requirement, and may be
      conducted at any time.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which stipulate a
      less stringent ordering requirement for the performance of these
      actions.
      (*Was: 805*)

========================================

Rule 908 (Mutable)
Formal Apologies

908.  Time Requirement for Formal Apologies

      If a Player (herein called the Squealer) makes a Call For
      Judgement alleging that a Player (herein called the Ninny) has
      acted or has failed to act in such a way as to be in violation
      of one or more Rules, and this CFJ is Judged TRUE, then the
      Judge must issue an Injunction that the Ninny submit a Formal
      Apology.  This Injunction may also include a list of up to ten
      Prescribed Words.  By a Formal Apology is meant a letter of at
      least 200 words, containing all of the Prescribed Words,
      explaining the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
      for self-improvement, and posted in the Public Forum within 72
      hours of the posting of the Injunction to the Public Forum.
      If the Ninny fails to meet these criteria e shall lose 10
      points.  Within 72 hours of the posting of this Formal Apology,
      the Squealer must either submit a Proposal that the Ninny's
      Apology be accepted, or submit a Proposal that the Ninny's
      Aplology be rejected, but not both.  No other Player may submit
      such a Proposal, and the Squealer may submit only one.  If a
      Proposal to accept the Apology fails, or if a Proposal to reject
      the Apology passes, then the Ninny loses 5 Points.

Rule 910
Appeals and the Justiciar

910.  The Justices and the Justiciar

      Let there be three Players known as the Justices, and an Office
      known as the Justiciar.  The Justiciar shall not receive a
      weekly salary.  The Speaker and the Clerk of the Courts are
      ineligible to be Justiciar.

      The positions of Justice shall be held by the Speaker, the Clerk
      of the Courts, and the Justiciar;  or by their representatives
      as detailed in this Rule.

      The Justices shall have the duty to Judge Statements that have
      been Appealed.  They shall receive the same compensation as
      Judges for each Statement so Judged.

      The Speaker and Clerk may delegate their duties as Justices to
      other willing Players if they desire.  They must do so if a
      Player would otherwise hold more than one position of Justice.

      Any Justice must so delegate eir duties for a particular case
      if e made the original CFJ, if e was the Judge of the original
      CFJ, or if e was Accused by that CFJ of breaking a Rule or
      committing a Crime.

      If no Player is willing to receive the duties of Justice for a
      case, the Clerk of the Courts shall select one randomly.

========================================

Rule 911 (Mutable)
Appealing Judgement

911.  Appealing Judgement

      A Judgement may be Appealed upon the insistence of any three
      Players to the Public Forum.

      If a Judgement is successfully Appealed, the Justices shall each
      Judge the Statement as if they were Judges.  They may confer
      with each other on the case before delivering Judgement if they
      desire.  If a Justice should fail to return Judgement in the
      allotted time, e shall be fined three Points for each day by
      which e missed the deadline.  This fine shall be levied by the
      Scorekeepor.

      If a majority of the Justices' Judgements agree, the Statement
      shall be considered to have been Judged accordingly.  Otherwise,
      it shall be considered to have been ruled UNDECIDED.  The
      Justices' reasoning and arguments shall be recorded with the
      original CFJ.

      Once a Judgement has been made, the Justices may make
      Injunctions just as may Judges, provided a majority of them
      agree.

      The decision of the Justices is final; no further Appeal of that
      Statement may be made.

      If the decision of the original Judge of the Statement is
      changed by the Justices, the Judge shall return the compensation
      e received to the Point Reserve.

      There shall be additional legal Declarations which are as
      follows:

         (Award a Patent Title) shall be used if the Proposal does not
            Enact a Rule, but awards an existing Patent Title to a
            person.
         (Run for Office) shall be used if a Proposal seeks to place a
            Player in Office, according to the Rules for Offices.

Call For Judgement 153

The Judge is    Lance

Caller:         Stella?
Date:           Thu, 23 Jun 94 10:27:27 SET


Barred Players: Vlad, Chuck

Judge:          Lance
Date Assigned:  Thu Jun 23 09:31:06 EDT 1994
Date Judged:    Thu Jun 23 10:03:31 EDT 1994

The Judgement:  TRUE

Scorekeepor:    Player Lance receives 5 points for Speedy Judgement

-----------------

The Statement

I would like to have legal guidance on the statement:

"Vlad is On Hold since May 5."

Arguments:
My principle argument is a message Vlad sent to the server on May 5.
I construed this message as an On Hold message, although no confirmation
from the Speaker followed (as required by Rule 870). However, it may
be noted that Alice was in a similar situation. She claims to have
send Garth an On Hold message, also in the beginning of May, which
was never properly relayed.

The second argument is the score report of June 10. Nobody disputed
this score report, although it already lists Vlad as being On Hold.
Hence, by Rule 463, this score report is now considered to reflect
the true scores.

The third argument is that Vlad's account seems to have been deleted.
(He does predict this in his message, by the way.) Consequently no sign
of life was hpeard of him, since May 5. This implies that he was to be
deregistered on May 19 (by Rule 460), *unless* he is actually On Hold.

------------------

The Judgement:

    I judge this statement to be TRUE.

Arguments:

    In eis message dated 5 May 94, Vlad did inform the subscribers of
    the listserv eis intendion to go On Hold.

    Rule 815 has no bearing here because the Speaker is not an
    Officer.   This is evidenced by simple examination of the Blue
    pages of the Phonebook and by Rule 676 which specifies the Blue
    pages.

    Therefor a message to the listserv is sufficient because the
    Speaker was subscribed to the listserv at the time of the message.

References:

Rule 815 (Mutable)

      Let all messages, information, requests, statements, CFJs,

      a specific Office or Officer be sent directly to them.  

      Instances where a Player breaks this rule are to be ignored by
      said Office or Officer until e receives the message thru means
      not broadcast to the Public Forum.  Further, it shall be
      considered a Class A crime to send such a message to the Public
      Forum without first sending it to the proper Office or Officer.

      It shall be a Class A crime for an Office/r to respond to such a
      message if it was not sent in the proper manner.

Rule 676 (Mutable)

676.  The Nomic Phone Books

      Add to the Registrar's duties the following:

      Nomic White Pages: List of all Players; their Nomic nickname,
      preferred email address, and (only if desired by the Player)
      their real name. Each entry is annotated with one of these
      codes: (A) - active player; (H) - on hold; (L) - left the Game.

      Nomic Blue Pages: "Government Listing". List of each Officer and
      other official Nomic positions (like Speaker), and the Nomic
      nickname and email address of the Player in that position. May
      also include other special official information like the address
      of the Nomic listserver, etc.

      Some latitude is granted to the Registrar in the formatting of
      these Directories. If necessary, restrictions will be imposed.
      The Registrar shall post them whenever e is required to post a
      list of Players. Additionally, e shall provide this information
      to any Player upon request.

Not really. I hoped that Players could use it to ventilate some of their
irritation for Scamsters.

Any way, here is the next iteration of the Honour PP, hopefully with
the blatant holes stopped.
By the way, the idea is Malcolm's, a Tabula Player, but the details
are quite different.

- Changing the name (Coren): No problem if you can come up with
words replacing Honour, Honourix, and Honouri.
`Face' for the three wouldn't do, IMO.
- Changed `Might Samourai' to `Shogun' (Wes)
- I agree that it is nicer if the system would replace Points and not
be added to it. However, in the case the Sucker would not pass, I suggest
replacing the last paragraph by (Wes' suggestion to avoid conspiracies):

"If a Player has more than 90% of the Points needed to win, while not
being Shogun, e will loose 25 Points."

- I doubled the initial Honour to 20 and the Shogun limit to 40, as
I realize that otherwise Shoguns would be created and destroyed with
too high frequency.
- Fractional transfers are impossible in this Rule. (But?)
- There is a limit on the maximum change in Honour possible per Week.


Proto-PROPOSAL     (Stella?)
Honour
(Creates a Rule)
Let there be an entity called the Honourix.

Initially every Player holds 20 Honouri. New Players shall start
with 20 Honouri as well. No Player shall have less than zero Honouri.
No Player shall have a non-integral number of Honouri.
The number of Honouri held by each Player shall be
kept track of by the Scorekeepor and published at least weekly.

No more than once a week each Player may send a message to the
Scorekeepor requesting the transfer of exactly one Honourix from
one Player of eis choice to another Player of eis choice.
The requesting Player may not eimself be the receiving Player.

The maximum change per week in the number of Honouri a Player holds
that is permitted is ten. All transfers in excess are not taken into
account.

A Player who's Proposal is adopted shall receive 1 Honouri to be
taken randomly from the Active Players who did not bother to vote.
If all Active Players voted, the donating Player shall be selected
among the Active Players who ABSTAINed or voted AGAINST that Proposal.

A Player who holds zero Honouri shall be known and addressed as
`Honourless Worm' and shall address Players with more Honour as
`Your Honour'.

A Player who holds more than fourty Honouri shall be known and
addressed as `Shogun' and may address Players with less Honour in any
way e sees  fit.

A Shogun may `cash in eis Honour', by opting to become Current
Champion. However, such an honourless act will make eim loose 40
Honouri and e will no longer be Shogun.

Greetings,

Hello.

I am grievously sorry for my sudden disappearance.

Basically, many factors converged at once to make my life truly
miserable.  I am sorry that I didn't do something to provide
continuity for the game while I picked up the pieces.

I am desperately reading through the last several weeks of mail,
trying to figure out what is going on (400+ messages...)

For the record, if I have not been deregistered yet, I desire to
remain a Player, if not Speaker at this time.

Sorry once again for letting my troubles screw things up.

                   Garth

Okay, our first order of business now that we're back is to go through
the Rule Set and make some MAJOR improvements. However, due to an early
inconsistancy, we are prevented from doing that with any efficiency. 
Therefore, we would like to start with the following short series of
Proposals:

----------

PROTO-PROPOSAL xxx (Wes)

Transmute 105
(Tramsmutes a Rule)

Rule 105 shall be Transmuted from an Immutable Rule into a Mutable Rule.

----------

PROTO-PROPORAL yyy (Wes)

Define a Proposal
(Amends a Rule)

Rule 105 shall be Amended to read thus:
A Proposal may contain one or more Rule Changes. A Rule Change may do any
of the following: Create a new Rule (add a Rule to the Rule Set), Repeal
an existing Rule (delete a Rule from the Rule Set), Amend a Rule (Change
a Rule which is in the Rule Set), or Transmute a Rule (Make an Immutable
Rule Mutable, or make a Mutable Rule Immutable). A Proposal may also
contain any other material specifically allowed for in legislation.

----------

PROTO-PROPOSAL zzz (Wes)

Re-Transmute 105
(Transmutes a Rule)

Rule yyy shall be Transmuted from a Mutable Rule into an Immutable Rule.

----------


We had originally planned to take advantage of certain loopholes which this
poorly worded Rule creates, thus causing a great deal of chaos, confustion,
consternation, and other undesirable (?) conditions, but we were convinced
to try doing it in a democratic fashion first... If it is not obvious why
this Amendment is necessary, please let us know, and we will compose an
explanation about the condition caused by this poorly phrased Rule.

If you are planning to Vote AGAINST this Proposal, please let us know so
that we may determine what course would be best to follow. Please also
let us know why, so that we may possibly adjust our method to satisfy
everyone.

Thank you. (And this one isn't even a scam; it's a legitimate problem
with the Rules... <grin>)


Enjoy!

At present Group Members have an extra Vote for free.
This rather discriminating situation of the unaffiliated Players
ought to be cured.

PROTO-PROPOSAL     (Stella?)
End the discrimination
(Creates a Rule)

If on any Proposal a Group casts a Vote, then all Players not
affiliated to a Group, may cast an extra vote.

The Rule Set has a lot of unnecessary wood *and* it is desesperingly
complex for new Players. The next proposal tries to cure this.

Proto-Proposal     (Stella?)
Reduce the complexity
(Creates a Rule)

When the number of Rules is larger than 100 proposals that propose
to Repeal, to Amend or to Transmute a Rule shall be distributed before
Proposals that propose to create a Rule.

When the number of Rules is larger than 100 any proposal that
proposes to Repeal a Rule will earn its submitter a bonus of
5 Points on adoption.

Stella?

The Statement

I'd like to CFJ on the following statement (with thanks to Malcolm
Ryan who pointed at the problem):

"As at present it is not possible to submit Proposals and have them
distributed, no further Play is possible"

Arguments to this outrageous statement:

The way that Proposals shall be made and distributed *seems* to be
nicely gouverned by Rule 415: " A Proposal by a Voter shall be made
by submitting it to the Mighty Speaker".

I ask you: who *is* this Mighty Speaker?  David Bowen?
No, he is only Speaker, both by Rule 724 (winning the
Game) and Rule 785 (Speaker succession).

We don't have a Mighty Speaker. This esteemed person disappeared
when the Rules declaring eim to be one disappeared (back in 1993).

Hence we have no Mighty Speaker and Proposal submission is
*legally* impossible.

References:
415.  "How a Proposal is Submitted":

      A Proposal by a Voter shall be made by submitting it to the
      Mighty Speaker. As soon as possible after receiving the
      Proposal, the Mighty Speaker shall assign the Proposal a Number
      and distribute the Proposal along with its number to all
      Players.

      The Mighty Speaker may also make Proposals. The Mighty Speaker
      must process all pending Voter-submitted Proposals first, and
      may then Process Proposals of the Mighty Speaker, assigning
      these Proposals a number and distributing them in the same
      fashion as any other Proposal.
724.  Requirements for Winning

      The Winner is the first Voter to achieve sufficiently many
      Points.  The minimum number of Points required for Player X to
      win is 10*N*(1+G/6), where N is the number of Players currently
      registered in the Game, and G is the number of Games which
      Player X has already won.  If more than one Voter achieves this
      condition simultaneously, then all such Voters win.  When a Game
      ends in this manner:
        - If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the new
          Speaker and the old Speaker becomes a Voter.
        - If there is more than one Winner, the Voter with the highest Point
          total becomes the new Speaker.  If more than one Voter is
          tied for the highest score, the old Speaker randomly selects
          one of them to become the new Speaker.  The old Speaker
          becomes a voter.
        - All Player's scores are reset to 0.
        - A new Game is begun.  All Rules and Proposals retain the
          status they had at the end of the old Game.
785.  Improve Speaker Succession I

      If the Speaker has abandoned eir post, another new, Temporary
      Speaker is selected according to the "Rules of Succession", or
      if no such rules are defined, the other Player not on hold with
      the highest Score becomes the temporary Speaker.  This does not
      force the Game to be over in this case, and Scores are not reset
      to 0. The Game continues until a Player Wins, at which time a
      new Game is begun and the Winner becomes the real Speaker. The
      Temporary Speaker shall make reasonable effort to obtain the
      former Speaker's materials: proposal queue, voting records, etc.
      but if this is not possible, then the Temporary Speaker shall
      request that these be resubmitted by the Players. If a Speaker
      is replaced in this manner, e has eir score set to minus 2N
      Points immediately, where N is the number of Points required for
      a Player to Win the Game.

      Abandonment is determined as follows: If any Player suspects
      that the Speaker has Abandoned, e sends a message to all Players
      calling on the Speaker to announce eir presence.  The Speaker
      must reply to all Players within one week; if e does not, e is
      considered to have Abandoned.

-----------------

The Statement

I'd like to CFJ on the following statement (with thanks to Malcolm
Ryan who pointed at the problem):

"As at present a vote can never be completed,
no further Play is possible"

Arguments to this outrageous statement:

According to Rule 376, Rule changes take effect `at the moment of the
completion of the vote that adopted it.'
The moment of the completion of the vote is defined as given `by
the date and time given in the line starting with "Date:" of the
Nomic listserver message send by the Benevolent Speaker, announcing
the result of the vote on the corresponding proposal.'

And who, I may ask, is this Benevolent Speaker? David Bowen?
No, he is only Speaker, both by Rule 724 (winning the
Game) and Rule 785 (Speaker succession).

We don't have a Benevolent Speaker, who may send out the messages
with the Voting Results. This esteemed person disappeared
when the Rules declaring eim to be one disappeared (back in 1993).

Hence the required message which effectively completes the Vote
can never be send out legallly.

Note: a paradox in a paradox.
By declaring this Statement TRUE, Rule 413 will cause continuation
of Play, as it requires the Judge to cure the problem, after which
the submitter of this CFJ will be instated as....
Benevolent Speaker.

References:
376.  Time that a rule change takes effect:

      An adopted rule change takes full effect at the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it.
      The moment of the completion of the vote is defined by the date
      and time given in the line starting with "Date:" of the Nomic
      listserver message send by the Benevolent Speaker, announcing
      the result of the vote on the corresponding proposal.

      request that these be resubmitted by the Players. If a Speaker
      is replaced in this manner, e has eir score set to minus 2N
      Points immediately, where N is the number of Points required for
      a Player to Win the Game.

      Abandonment is determined as follows: If any Player suspects
      that the Speaker has Abandoned, e sends a message to all Players
      calling on the Speaker to announce eir presence.  The Speaker
      must reply to all Players within one week; if e does not, e is
      considered to have Abandoned.

Here is a list of the Proposals which we feel would be necessary to
fully reconcile the differences between the definition of a Proposal and
the definition of a Rule Change.

----------

PROTO-PROPOSAL 1001
Prepare 105:
(Transmute a Rule)

Immutable Rule 105 shall be Transmuted to a Mutable Rule.

----------

PROTO-PROPOSAL 1002
Amend 105:
(Amends a Rule)

Rule 105 shall be Amended to read as follows:
A Rule Change may do any one of the following: Enact a Rule (Add 
a new Rule to the Rule Set), Amend a Rule (Change an existing 
Rule in the Rule Set), Repeal a Rule (Remove an existing Rule 
from the Rule Set), or Transmute a Rule (Change an Immutable 
Rule to Mutable, or a Mutable Rule to Immutable). 

----------

PROTO-PROPOSAL 1003
Immortalize the change:
(Transmutes a Rule)

Rule 1002 shall be Transmuted from Mutable to Immutable.

----------

PROTO-PROPOSAL 1004
Definition of a Proposal:
(Creates a Rule)

A Proposal may contain one or more Rule Changes. A single Proposal 
may not Enact or Amend more than one Rule. If the Proposal is
Adopted, then all Rule Changes within that Proposal shall take
effect. A Proposal may also make any other change in the Game state
which is specifically allowed for in the Rule Set.

----------

PROTO-PROPOSAL 1005
Immortalize a Proposal:
(Transmutes a Rule)

Rule 1004 shall be Transmuted from Mutable to Immutable.

----------

PROTO-PROPOSAL 1006
Update 106:
(Transmutes a Rule)(Amends a Rule)

Immutable Rule 106 shall be Transmuted to Mutable, and shall then
be Amended to read:

All Proposals proposed in the proper way shall be Voted upon. They will
be Adopted if and only if they receive the required number of Votes
and Quorum is achieved.

This Rule shall then be Transmuted to Immutable.

----------

PROTO-PROPOSAL 1007
Update 107:
(Transmutes a Rule)(Amends a Rule)

Immutable Rule 107 shall be Transmuted to Mutable, and shall be
Amended to read:

Any Proposal must be written down (or otherwise communicated in 
print media) before it is Voted on. If Adopted, it must guide play 
in the form in which it was Voted on.

This Rule shall then be Transmuted to Immutable.

----------

PROTO-PROPOSAL 1008
Update 108:
(Transmutes a Rule)(Amends a Rule)

Immutable Rule 108 shall be Transmuted to Mutable, and shall then
be Amended to read:

No Proposal may take effect earlier than the moment of the completion 
of the Vote that Adopted it, even if its wording explicitly states 
otherwise. No Proposal may have retroactive application.

This Rule shall then be Transmuted to Immutable.

----------

PROTO-PROPOSAL 1009
Update 109:
(Transmutes a Rule)(Amends a Rule)

Immutable Rule 109 shall be Transmuted to Mutable and shall be
Amended to read as follows:

The Speaker shall give each Proposal a Number for reference. The 
Numbers shall begin with 301, and each Proposal proposed in the 
proper way shall receive the next successive integer, whether or 
not the Proposal is Adopted. If a Rule is Enacted, the Rule shall
recieve the Number of the Proposal to Enact it.  If a Rule is 
Amended or Transmuted, it receives the Number of the Proposal to 
Amend or Transmute it.

This Rule shall then be Transmuted to Mutable.

----------

PROTO-PROPOSAL 1010
Update 209:
(Amends a Rule)

Rule 209 shall be Amended to read:
Quorum for a Proposal is defined to be 20% of Voters at the beginning 
of the prescribed Voting Period for that Proposal.

----------

PROTO-PROPOSAL 1011
Update 376:
(Amends a Rule)

Rule 376 shall be Amended to read:
A Proposal is Adopted at the moment that the results of the Vote which
Adopted it is posted to the Public Forum. This is determined by the
time and date appearing in the "Date:" line of the message which
announced the results.

----------

This is quite a slew of Proposals, but it is the only way to actually,
legally put right the great void between a Proposal and a Rule Change.
A single Rule is unable to do so. Please look through this list of Rule
Changes with an honest eye as to what is best to the Game. Then look
closely at the difference between these proposed Rules and the current
Rules. Note the variations, and what a few well placed CFJ's could do
to totally disrupt the Game.

Oh, and FYI, the Rule which "activates" with the Transmutation of 105
is simply a safeguard, as this plan was written just prior to the passage
of that Rule. Between the time that Rule 105 is Transmuted to Mutable,
and then Transmuted back to Immutable, that Rule will take precedence,
and will keep things organized. When Rule 105 is Transmuted back to
Immutable, the two Rules conflict, and the Mutable Rule becomes null and
void. 

Also note that the multiple Declarations in these Proto-Proposals are not
only legal, but required by law. They are also required to be on a single
line, which is simply aesthetics; we mean to rectify that small problem
as well, as well as numerous other mis-references in the Rules. This,
however, will simplify things tremendously, and will make us comfortable
playing once again.

Then all that remains is to define the succession of the Speaker, and we
believe that the greatest  threats to the survival of eNomic will be
eliminated. Then we can have some FUN.... <grin>


Enjoy!

I am honored to have been chosen for the Offices of Archivist, 
Distributor/Assistant, and Sweepstakes Officer.  I accept. with
thanks.

Distributor's Notes:

1)  I am currently testing (internally) an automatic distribution system 
for OFF: messages as Oerjan's setup doesn't quite work for me.  I will 
let people know as soon as it is active.  In the meantime, please not 
that the previous Distribution address of "oerjan@nvg.unit.no" IS MISSING 
SEVERAL OF THE NEW PLAYERS AND WILL NOT WORK.  DO *NOT* USE THIS ADDRESS.

2)  In the interim, please send messsages intended for distribution to my 
alternate address:

	coren@suuper.suu edu

with the string "OFF:" in the Subject:.

Do NOT send other eNomic communication to this address; at the moment 
please use it for official Distributor messages ONLY.

3)  Use of this address may involve a delay of up to 48 hours as I will be 
forwarding messages manually - this should be atypical; more normal 
delays will be 12-24 hours depending on how often I am able to check my 
mail. 

Mr. Registrar, please take note of this for the phonebook.


Sweepstakes Officer's Notes:

1)  I am currently going to operate under the assumption that a Sweepstakes
only needs to be held for any week on which a designated Sweepstakes
Offficer existed, and that I am only responsible for Lottery periods which
fall during my tenure as Officer, as I have already argued elsewhere.  If
anyone has a problem with this, I am quite willing to abide by the 
results of a CFJ.

2)  I will be holding the Lottery for this past week as soon as possible 
after the end of the week - but, I believe that there were no Proposals 
made this week, and if this situation doesn't change before 11:59 
tonight, there will be no Entries and thus no Winner.  Someone please 
correct me if I'm wrong on this.

3)  Hopefully I'm not being stone blind, but...Am I correct in seeing 
that the "Secret Word Sweepstakes" mentioned in the Sweepstakes Officer 
Rule is no longer in existance?

Coren
