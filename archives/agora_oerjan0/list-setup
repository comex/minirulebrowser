This is the setup I have been using for the Distributor List,
using the elm mailer and filter.

if (from contains "nomic@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au") then leave
if (subject matches /^OFF:/) then executec "/usr/lib/sendmail `/local/bin/elmalias players`"
--- end .elm/filter-rules ---

All messages are left in my mailbox, and I then save official messages
(both those through the filter and not) to the mail folder Mail/distrib .
When messages are more than a week old I move them to Mail/prior ;
I then save the weekly digests to folders
Mail/digests/month.date1-date2 ,
add the contents list to Mail/digests/Directory and compress the folder
with standard Unix compress into Mail/digests/month.date1-date2.Z .
A copy of the Mail/digests directory is put on the ftp server in /pub/nomic/digests .
