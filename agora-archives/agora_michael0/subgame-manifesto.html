<h1>Why Agora should have a rule-changing sub-game</h1>

<ol>
  <li> The interesting thing about Agora is its rule-changing aspect.
  <li>However, economic manipulation and competitive game-play don't sit
      very well in Agora at the moment.  This is because:
      <ul>
        <li> the game never ends (hasn't so far anyway :-), which in turn
            means that there is no reset button, and we get <a href="#gerontocracy-syndrome">Gerontocracy
            Syndrome</a>.
     <li> all the neato stuff we dream up that would play well in a
         finite game, either
         <ul>
           <li>favours the already entrenched, or creates advantage to
           those Players present at the time, disadvantaging potential
           New Players; or
         <li>is divisive and threatens long-term stability (but would
           probably work quite well if we weren't in a never-ending
           game, because alliances etc would start afresh)
       </ul>
 </ul>
<li>Because of (2), I think we are right to try and invent a resetting
   sub-game, where we can be devious and cunning and know that
   enmities, plots and conspiracies are relatively short-term.  About
   the only thing we might want to preserve past resets would be
   sub-game rules.
<li>Because of (1), I think the sub-game should include a rule-changing
   aspect.  (Without it, we might as well ignore Agora and go away to
   play the sub-game separately.)
<li>However, the rules changeable by players of the sub-game should
   <em>not</em> include all of Agora's rules.  Otherwise, the sub-game
   isn't really a sub-game at all.  In particular, sub-game physics
   (maps, topography, types of land, ways of developing land) should
   not be alterable by the sub-game rule-changing mechanism.
<li> Of course, the Players of the sub-game and the Players of Agora are
   probably the same sets.  So, we should enact a high level rule that
   says that Agora-level changes to sub-game physics do not take
   effect until the next iteration of the sub-game.  This should
   ensure that rule-making at the Agoran level doesn't get too
   partial.
</ol>

<h1>Terminology</h1>

<dl>
  <dt><strong><a name="gerontocracy-syndrome">Gerontocracy Syndrome</a></strong>
  <dd>The tendency of the game to feature entrenched, powerful
      Players, who are generally long established and experienced, and
      have used these advantages to put themselves into influential
      positions.
  <dt><strong>Sub-game</strong>
  <dd>A game played within Agora.  Agora has the Contest mechanism to
      provide this facility already.

      sub-game.  This game didn't generate enough interest, and wasn't
      played.  My only guess as to why this should be so is that the
      game doesn't have much of a theme to it and perhaps seems a little
      sterile as a result.
