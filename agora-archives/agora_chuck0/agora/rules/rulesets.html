<h1 align=center>Rulesets</h1>
<p align=center><strong>
The Rules were last updated on
May 5, 2001
<br>and include effects of Proposals through Proposal
4146, and Proposal 4149.

<p class=longp>
If you wish to see all of Agora's current Rules on a single
page, there are three different options for the Ruleset's format.
<p class=longp>
The <strong>Logical Rulesets</strong> list the Rules in something
approaching in logical order--ideally, they are presented in
an order which will make it easy for someone new to Agora to
read through and understand.  Because of the interlinked nature
of the Rules, however, this is only possible to a limited extent.
<p class=longp>
The <a href="/~ccarroll/cgi-bin/agscr/flr.pl">Full Logical
Ruleset</a> gives a brief explanation of the way each
Rule is presented, and a table of contents of the Categories.
For each Category, a brief description is given.
For each Rule, its Number, Power, and Title are given; its
text; official and unofficial annotations; and its history,
so far as it is known. (~350K)
<p class=longp>
The <a href="/~ccarroll/cgi-bin/agscr/slr.pl">Short Logical
Ruleset</a> gives only the Number, Power, Title, text, and
official annotations for each Rule.  (~270K)
<p class=longp>
The <a href="/~ccarroll/cgi-bin/agscr/nr.pl">Numerical Ruleset</a>
lists the Rules in numerical order.  The format of the Rules is
the same as in the Full Logical Ruleset.  (~340K)
<p class=longp>
You can also look at Agora's <a href="/~ccarroll/agora/rules/initl.html"
>Initial Ruleset</a>, which was in effect at Agora's founding on
June 30, 1993.  (Only 12K, if you can believe that.)
