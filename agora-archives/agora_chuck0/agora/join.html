<h1 align=center>Joining Agora Nomic</h1>

Think you might be interested in joining Agora as a Player?  Read on!

<h2 align=center>What makes Agora different from other nomics?</h2>

<p align=center><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> a purely personal answer by Chuck.
</p>
<p class=longp>
Peter Suber, inventor of Nomic, makes a distinction between <em>substantive</em>
and <em>procedural</em> games.  He writes,
</p>
<blockquote class=longp>
In substantive games,
     players play to earn points and win. In procedural games, they try to tie the rules into knots, either for the
     logical fun of it or in order to win by paradox rather than by points.
</blockquote>

<p class=longp>
Nomics, of course, are generally procedural, but even so, some are
more procedural than others.  The more substantive nomics are more
like game-testing groups--players try to make interesting games,
and if they don't work well, they can change the Rules.  The more
procedural nomics focus more on changing the basic mechnisms of
nomic--the legislative and judicial systems.  Agora
is probably <em>the</em> most procedural nomic around.  If you're
looking for a very procedural nomic, then Agora might be for
you.  If you like nomics with lots of pretty trinkets, it probably
isn't.  Not that we don't get silly once in a while, but 
a lot less so than most other nomics.  Among other nomics, Agora
is known as "the serious nomic."
</p>
<p class=longp>
Also, as the oldest Internet nomic, we have one of the most
developed Rulesets.  If you don't want to have to hash out
many of the problems that young nomics face, Agora might be
for you.  If you're interested in hashing them out, and looking
for new solutions to old problems, it might not be.  (Not that
we don't welcome new ideas on how to fix the many problems we
do have!)
</p>
<p class=longp>
I find that Agora Players tend to be very blunt in their comments.
If I float an idea that someone else thinks is stupid, I'm likely
to be told so, quite clearly.  Don't let me scare you--we make
every effort to be kind and helpful to new players.  But Agorans
generally don't waste time mincing words.  This style of play
isn't for everyone--many previous players have Left in a Huff.
But I rather enjoy it--if I'm told that a Judgement of mine
is well-reasoned, I know that the praise is deserved.

<p class=longp>
Then come and watch us for a while!  Join us, if you feel comfortable.
How?  Subscribe to the mailing lists.  Agora is played on five
(yes, five) mailing lists.  Subscription to four of those five
is required of all Players; the fifth is optional, though highly
recommended.
</p>
<h3 class=longp>The Three Main Lists</h3>
<dl class=longp>
<dt>agora-official@gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au
<dd>Mainly for Officers' Reports.  A Public Forum.  Subscription
required.
<p></p>
<dt>agora-business@gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au
<dd>For other communications which have a legal significance within
Agora.  A Public Forum.  Subscription required.
<p></p>
<dt>agora-discussion@gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au
<dd>For unofficial discussion of Agora--but a *lot* of it
goes on here.  Subscription optional, but highly recommended.
Feel free to ask lots of questions here.
<p></p>
</dl>

<p class=longp>
To subscribe to these three lists, send a message to <a href=
"mailto:majordomo@gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au">majordomo@gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au</a>
with the body of the message:
</p>

subscribe agora-business<br>
subscribe agora-discussion</p><p></p>

<h3 class=longp>The Two Backup Lists</h3>
<p class=longp>
Normally there's no traffic on these.  The only time you'll see
anything on these two lists is when there's a problem with the
main lists.  
</p>

<div class=longp
<dl>
<dt>nomic@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au
<dd>A Public Forum.  Subscription required.
To subscribe, send mail to <a href=
"mailto:listserv@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au">listserv@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au</a>
with &quot;subscribe nomic&quot; in the body of the message.
<p></p>

<dt>agora@win.tue.nl
<dd>A Public Forum.  Subscription required.
To subscribe, send mail to <a href=
"mailto:majordomo@win.tue.nl">majordomo@win.tue.nl</a> with
&quot;subscribe agora&quot; in the body of the message.
<p></p>
</dl>
</div>

<p></p>
<h3 class=longp>OK, I'm subscribed.  Now what?</h3>

<p class=longp>
It's probably a good idea to observe for a week or so before
joining (although it's certainly not required) to get a feel
for the game.  If you like, introduce yourself to us on
agora-discussion.  Choose a nickname, if you want.  Ask
the Registrar to list you as a Watcher in the Registrar's
Report.  (There's no official significance to being a Watcher,
but you'll get your nickname and address listed in the Registrar's
report, making it easier for others to find you.)  Feel free
to jump in with questions.
</p>
<p class=longp>
While you're observing, read one of the <a href=
"/~ccarroll/agora/rules/rulesets.html">Rulesets</a>, or at
least read the important parts and skim through the rest.  Don't
try to do it all at one sitting--it's <em>long</em>.  The easiest
format of the Ruleset to read is probably the <a href=
"/~ccarroll/cgi-bin/agscr/slr.pl">Short Logical Ruleset</a>.
(Take the &quot;Short&quot; in &quot;Short Logical Ruleset&quot;
with a very large grain of salt; it's only short in comparison
to the <a href="/~ccarroll/cgi-bin/agscr/flr.pl">Full Logical
Ruleset</a>.  Heck, for that matter, take the &quot;Logical&quot;
with a large grain of salt too.  It's only logical in its ordering
of the Rules, as opposed to the <a href=
"/~ccarroll/cgi-bin/agscr/nr.pl">Numerical Ruleset</a>.) 
In addition to being available
on the web, the Short Logical Ruleset is posted weekly to
agora-official.
</p>
<p class=longp>
Another document which is very useful (although more so once
you become a Player) is the <a href=
"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/mn200/games/nomic/yoyo/registrar-report"
>Registrar's Report</a> [off-site link], which lists the
names and email addresses of Players, and the identity of the
various Officers.  The Registrar's Report is also posted
weekly to agora-official.
</p>
<p class=longp>
When you're ready to join as a Player, all you have to do is send
a message to a Public Forum--preferably agora-business--requesting
to become a Player.  Then the fun begins!
