This directory tree contains files that used to be in Chuck Carroll's web
space at <http://www.dfw.net/~ccarroll/>.  That website has now gone,
and the files are not available on Chuck's new website.  These files
were retrieved from the Internet Archive.

The directories "agora" and "cgi-bin" contain the latest available
versions of the Agora-related files from the website.  The directory
"flr" contains all (four) of the versions of the Full Logical Ruleset
from this website that are available in the Internet Archive.
