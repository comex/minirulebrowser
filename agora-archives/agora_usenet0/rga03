Post away! The Current Rule Set will shortly be available via anonymous ftp,
as soon as either the sysadmin we know returns from vacation, or when we
find another site upon which to make it available (any ideas?). It should
also be noted that Rule 357 has just been Repealed, and a couple new Rules
have been added, so this Rule Set is already out of date... :)

And the Speaker's email address (being my address) is 'wesc@ichips.intel.com'.
At this address, you may register as a player. To join the listserv, mail
to 'listserv@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au' with "sub nomic <yourname>" in the body
of the message. The address for the list is 'nomic@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au'.
If you do not like the volume of the list, and would still like to play, we
have now developed a system by which you may recieve only official type
announcements from the Speaker.

So join! Play! Enjoy!
