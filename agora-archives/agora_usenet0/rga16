From my vague and unreliable memory:

In Agora nomic we had (presumably long before you joined) a win by
paradox rule, I think inherited from Nomic World.  It had a provision
that if a paradox arose, the Rules would be rewinded to the latest
point before it was introduced---not that I recall this provision ever
being invoked.

However, at some point someone managed to argue that there had been a
paradox in the initial Rules, something they had no provision to
recover from, except to halt the game.  Then someone noted that this
would conflict with the higher precedence Rule which required passing
of Proposals to be possible.

So essentially we got down to the conclusion that the game would go
on, regardless, and moreover the idea that a single undeniable
inconsistency would automatically wreak havoc on the entire game was
discarded - rejecting reductio ad absurdum, as it were.  Soon (?) we
lost interest in paradoxes and repealed the Win by Paradox Rule.

Greetings,
Ørjan.
