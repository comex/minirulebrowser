The *.mbox files are an archive of the <agora-official@agoranomic.org>,
<agora-business@agoranomic.org>, and <agora-discussion@agoranomic.org>
mailing lists hosted at yzma.clarkk.net, Agora's primary mailing
lists.  The archive was supplied by the Mailman software at
<http://www.agoranomic.org/cgi-bin/mailman/private/agora-official/>,
<http://www.agoranomic.org/cgi-bin/mailman/private/agora-business/>, and
<http://www.agoranomic.org/cgi-bin/mailman/private/agora-discussion/>.
These files cover the period from the start of the archive up to the
end of 2006, and are divided up by year.  The year is as judged by the
list server.

The yzma archive does not cover the list's entire history.  These mailing
lists went ints operation in 2001 or 2002, but the archive only goes back
to 2002-11.  The archive is presumably complete for the period from the
first recorded message on each list (2002-11-04).
