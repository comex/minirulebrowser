The file nomic.mbox is an archive of the <nomic@yoyo.its.monash.edu.au>
mailing list, one of Agora's backup mailing lists.
The archive was supplied by the Mailman software at
<http://yoyo.its.monash.edu.au/pipermail/nomic/>.  This file covers the
period from the start of the archive up to the end of 2006.

The yoyo archive does not cover the list's entire history.  yoyo was
Agora's first mailing list, back in 1993, and the list is even older than
that, having formerly been the Nomic World mailing list.  The archive
only goes back to 2003-08, when the list software was changed to Mailman.
The archive is presumably complete for the period from the first recorded
message (2003-08-26).
