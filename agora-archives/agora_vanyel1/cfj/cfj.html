<center><h1>CFJs</h1></center>

The judicial system of Agora is fairly complex.  In order to get a
statement judged, one must first submit a Call For Judgement (CFJ) to
the Clerk of the Courts.  It is then assigned to a Judge, who returns a
reasonable Judgement on the Statement.  If there is <em>still</em> a
dispute, the decision can be Appealed; then three people pass further
Judgement on the matter.
<p>
This is a semi-complete archive of CFJs that have taken place.  Now that
the doctrine of <em>stare decisis</em> is in place, Andre has composed
a <a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/~engels/stare.txt">summary listing</a>
of most of the CFJs that have happened so far.
<p>
Until I come up with a better way to do it, I'm just going to give a
link to the FTP-style listing of my <a href=".">CFJ directory</a>.  Have
fun.
