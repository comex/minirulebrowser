<h1>Theses</h1>
In December 1994, ChrisM came up with a system by which Nomicians
everywhere could be awarded Degrees in Nomic--Associate, Bachelor,
Masters, and Doctorate.  To do so, one must submit a Thesis; below are
listed all submitted Theses.
<p> <ul>
	<li>I have now found a copy of Steve's thesis, but I'm not sure
	    if it's the final version that got submitted and voted on...
	    anyway, it's called <a href="steve-bn">Breaking the
	    Rules</a>, and it got him his Bachelor's.
	<li>Pascal's <a href="pascal-an.html">untitled thesis on Agoran
	    economics</a> <em>(Rejected as Associate of Nomic by
	    Proposal 1469, 8 March 1995)</em>
	<li>Vanyel's <a href="vanyel-bn">Pragmatism and Platonism: Two
	    Approaches to Nomic</a> <em>(Accepted as Bachelor of Nomic by
	    Proposal 1476, 8 March 1995)</em>
	<li>elJefe's <a href="eljefe-bn">Agora Nomic: Recent History
	    (Late 1994 to Early 1995)</a> <em>(Accepted as Bachelor of
	    Nomic by Proposal 1580, 2 May 1995)</em>
	<li>Favor's <a href="favor-bn">A Completely Formal Nomic</a>
	    <em>(Accepted as Bachelor of Nomic by Proposal 1755, 24
	    October 1995)</em>
