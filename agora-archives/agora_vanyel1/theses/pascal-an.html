     The economy, or lack thereof, that I have observed in Agora Nomic,
suggests that it needs to be changed. Marks have little or no value, and
there is a chance they will be repealed soon if nothing is done. Points have
apparently less value than they once had, and winning seems less appealing.
The one commodity worth trading, selling, and buying is the Vote.<p>
 Unfortunately, the concept of one player, one vote is something few people
want to give up. The Vototron and Group Votes were abolished for the same
reason; Supposedly they are 'undemocratic'. Does the Vototron favor rich
players? Maybe, but how did those players become point-rich? By passing
proposals that people liked, taking offices and receiving legitimate
salaries. They did NOT get randomly chosen to be rich and powerful!<p>
     I have no idea how Group Votes are considered undemocratic. Many world
governments are considered democratic, and yet the legislative, executive and
judicial power is placed in the hands of a small minority of people. In my
opinion, there is nothing inherently wrong about someone giving up power to
someone else voluntarily. And if you complain that the
groups-have-all-the-power-and-points-and-they-can-pass-any-proposal-they-want,

 form your own group! It is perfectly democratic because anyone can do it!<p>
     Votes' dynamicity was reduced before I even came to Agora, and I am
deeply disappointed that the fundamental aspect of the game has become so
static. The fundamental point of any game is to have fun - and how can anyone
have fun if we are all too worried about being safe?<p>
