      VOLUME 47, ISSUE 3
      August 20, 2000


ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"72 hours for Holidays" by Oerjan - Proposal 4036 adopted 8/6
   Players have three days after the end of a Holiday to do things
     they would otherwise have had to do during the Holiday.

"Clarify Rule 1596 (Debt)" by Oerjan - Proposal 4037 adopted 8/6
   Final paragraph regarding overpayment of debts is rearranged to
     clarify that the conditional applies to the entire paragraph.

"COE fix" by Taral - Proposal 4047 adopted 8/6
   The requirement to respond to a COE is suspended while the COE is
     disputed via CFJ.

"Fix Patronage" by Chuck - Proposal 4033 adopted 8/2
   The Speaker pays out Patronage, rather than transferring it directly
     (which e cannot do).

"Fix Rule 1747 (Pardoning Lawlessness)" by Oerjan - Proposal 4038
     adopted 8/6
   Eliminates mis-use of "Player" to mean "deregistered Player", as
     well as an inadvertent prohibition against transferring Indulgences
     to the Bank to expunge Blots.

"Minor Speaker Reforms" by Elysion - Proposal 4049 adopted 8/6
   A Tainted Speaker cannot change a Proposal from Ordinary to Democratic.
   Move the Registrar and Rulekeepor up in the Order of Succession.  Move
     the Justiciar and CotC down, since those Offices are lost when one
     becomes Speaker.

"My Votes Are My Own" by Chuck - Proposal 4035 adopted 8/2
   If a Nominee Stands Down, anyone who Voted for em may Vote again (but,
     in case e does not do so, is deemed to have declared Presence).

"Papyri" by t - Proposal 4050 adopted 8/6
   Papyri are a Bank Currency, tracked by the Promotor, and paid to
     get Proposals distributed.
   A Proposal's Distribution Cost is 1; +1 if Urgent, +1 if Sane (each
     Player may Vote at most once; no non-Player may Vote).
   While Disinterested, a Proposal is always Distributable.
   Interested Proposals start as Undistributable.  Any Player may pay
     a Proposal's Distribution Cost in Papyri to make it Distributable,
     or twice its Distribution Cost in Papyri to make it Undistributable.
   The Current Batch contains all Distributable Proposals.
   The Promotor chooses how many Papyri to Auction each month, but must
     Auction at least one.  If there are at least three Winners other than
     emself, then e may pay out to emself Stems equal to the Winning Bid.
   New Players get one Papyrus, plus one Papyrus per Interested Proposal
     adopted during eir Grace Period.
   Each non-Zombie Player gets one Papyrus when this Proposal is adopted.

"Probate Removal" by Peekee - Proposal 4048 adopted 8/6
   Two obsolete references to Probate are removed.

"Remove Proposal Number Reference from R1770" by Chuck - Proposal 4034
     adopted 8/2
   An obsolete reference to Proposal numbers (now deregulated) is removed
     from Rule 1770 (Distributing Proposals).

"Satiric Ballads" by Oerjan - Proposal 4039 adopted 8/6
   Eliminate the quarterly Immaculate bonus.

"Upmutations" by Oerjan - Proposal 4040 adopted 8/6
   Rules 693 (Prescribed Voting Period) and 376 (When Proposals Take
     Effect) are changed to Power=2.  This prevents an Ordinary Proposal
     from amending these Rules to arbitrarily delay the time it takes to
     make a Democratic Proposal take effect.

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

"Fixed Auction Lengths" by Chuck - Proposal 4041 rejected 8/10
   Bids may not be cancelled, but may be replaced with higher bids.
   Auctions always last 7 days.
   The Closing Price is the minimum amount that would have been needed
     to beat the highest losing bid.
   Private Auctions are repealed.

"Simplify Organizations" by Oerjan - Proposal 4052 failed quorum 8/7
   Groups and Contests are replaced with Political and non-Political
     Organizations.
   Executor and SLC Maintainer may both be different from Administrator
     (but are the same by default).
   To become Political, an Organization must have at least three Members,
     and none of its Members may belong to another Political Organization.

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Cleanup of Dismissals" by Murphy
   DISMISSED is a Judgement.
   Reasons for dismissal are Pragmatized and made non-redundant.
   Appeals Board may overturn on the possibility (not certainty)
     of an incorrect Judgement.

"Easier Scoring" by Murphy
   Remove the requirement from Rule 1929 (Points) that Score reports
     indicate the Rule allowing the Award or Penalty, since Rule 1930
     (Scoring) has been the only such Rule since it and Rule 1929 were
     adopted.

"Fix Rule 559" by harvel
   Remove a redundant requirement for the Registrar to report Active/
     Inactive status.

"Fix the Stupid Bug" by t - Proposal 4056
   Auctioned Papyri are paid out by the Promotor, not the Accountor.

"General budgets" by Oerjan - Proposal 4054
   Budgets are defined as a general class, with the Treasuror's Budget
     as one instance.

"Minor fix" by Peekee
   Correct a doubled "the" in Rule 1946 (Distribution of Voting
     Entitlements).

"More Fully Baked Oligarchy" by Kelly
   All Oligarchy Auction winners start as Low Oligarchs.  If this
     results in more than three Low Oligarchs, then one or more are
     shuffled up to the Middle and High levels.

"Objection fix" by Taral
   Objections may be withdrawn.

"One Less Rule Take II" by Elysion
   Simplify the specification of how many Kudos a new Player has.
   Move the definition of Shogun to the Rule defining Unique Patent
     Titles.  Also prevent multiple Shoguns at once.

"Points Adjustments" by Wes
   Points are clarified as non-Property.
   Patent Titles are only Score-worthy if not previously gained by the
     same Player during the previous seven days.
   Degrees are only Score-worthy if not previously gained by the same
     Player.
   Once per month, a Player possessing at least one Blot and at least
     one Indulgence continuously for seven days may be Penalized 5 Points.
   Being the only Immaculate Player is a Win Condition.
   Being non-Immaculate is a Win-Preventing Condition.
   Distributor is no longer a Patent Title.

"Proposal Entitlements" by Peekee
   Proposal Entitlements are to P-Notes as Voting Entitlements are to VTs.
   An entity's Proposing Power may be applied toward increasing the
     Priority of any of eir Proposals in the Queue.  When a Proposal
     leaves the Queue (for any reason), the entity gets eir Proposing
     Power back, and may apply it elsewhere.

"Respect for the dead" by Peekee - Proposal 4055
   Wills are re-defined, and the Notary may carry them out as e sees fit
     when handling Abandoned Property.

"Rule cleanup" by Taral
   Repeal Rule 1927 (Bank Currency Creation).

   Seven Players Appeal a Judgement:  5 Points to first three.
   Motion granted:  3 Points to submitter.
   Motion denied:  -3 Points to submitter.
   CFJ has only one eligible Judge:  4 Points to submitter.
   Retired from CotC or Justiciar for become Speaker:  6 Points.

   Fugitive from Justice re-registers:  10 Points.

"The Grand Warden of the Oligarchy" by harvel - Proposal 4053
   The GWO tracks the status of the Oligarchy, and must also announce
     vacancies in the Oligarchy.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Executor Tweak" by Murphy
   Actions performed by an Executor on behalf of another entity are
     deemed to have been performed by the other entity.

"Judicial Cleanup" by Peekee
   A CFJ may be Disallowed by the CotC (thus ceasing to be a CFJ) if:
     * It contains no single clearly identifiable Statement.
     * The Caller requests it, and its outcome would be trivial.
     * It is an Excess CFJ.
   Executor-related restrictions are moved to Rule 698 (Always an
     Eligible Judge).
   The CotC may recuse a Judge:
     * If e goes On Hold.
     * With 2 Supporters.
     * If it is 7 days past the end of the Deliberation Period and e
         still has not delivered Judgement.
   The Board of Appeals is deemed to act once an unchangeable majority
     is attained.
   Redundant statements of the revocation of Judicial salaries are
     repealed.
   Clarifies that a Call for Appeal must be properly executed before it
     permits the stay of a Judicial Order.

"Kudo Adjustments" by Wes
   Kudos are clarified as non-Property.

"No Bouncing VEs" by Kelly
   An entity's Voting Power is the lowest value that it would have been at
     any point from the time the Proposal was (distributed or made
     Democratic, whichever is later) to the time it attempts to Vote.

"What is Public?" by Wes
   Discussion Fora are defined.
   Any communication sent to a PF is deemed to have been sent to all Players.
   Any communication sent to all Players is deemed to have been made Publicly.
   This collects all PF timing requirements into a single place.
   Throughout the rest of the Ruleset, requirements to send something to the
     PF are replaced with requirements to do them Publicly.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1234  "Kudos are Property."
[TRUE]    7/19     Called by Murphy
           7/20-27  Assigned to Kelly, who Judges TRUE
           7/27-28  Appealed by Steve, Palnatoke, and Peekee
                      (Blob attempts to appeal in a-d)
           7/29     Appeal assigned to lee (by mistake), Taral, and Wes
           7/30     lee, Taral, and Wes all move to sustain
           7/30     Speaker Chuck takes eir proper seat on the Board
           8/2      Murphy moves that Judge Kelly return half eir Judicial
                      Salary to the Bank
           8/3      Chuck moves to sustain
           8/7      Kelly alleges that e is no longer Judge of this CFJ,
                      as Rule 408 makes em ineligible after 7 days (even
                      though e delivered Judgement within that time)
           Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1062 says that Players
             possess Kudos.  Rule 1942 defines any entity possessible
             by another Player as Property.

CFJ 1237  "The Order issued by Chuck on Sun, 23 Jul 2000 17:17:02 -0500
[FALSE]    was valid."
Appealed  7/25       Called by Taral
           7/26-27    Assigned to Oerjan, who Judges FALSE
           7/30       Taral moves that Chuck be Ordered to pay the Bank 24
                        P-Notes, the amount that Chuck received as a result
                        of the Order in question.
           7/30       Oerjan grants the motion
           7/30-8/19  Appealed by Murphy, Chuck, Steve, and Oerjan
           Caller's argument for FALSE (summary):  Chuck transferred some
             P-Notes for the purpose of paying a Fee.  The P-Note payment
             succeeded, but the Fee payment failed.  The Rules do not
             require that Players be reimbursed for failed Fee payments.
             Rule 1796 permits the validity of Chuck's Order to be proven
             by CFJ only if its execution is required by the Rules.
           Counterargument:  Rule 1796 also permits the validity of the
             Order to be proven by CFJ if its execution is "permitted in"
             the circumstances existing when it was executed.

CFJ 1238  "Rule 1930 'Scoring' is the only Rule allowing a Point Award or
Dismissed  Penalty for any particular type of event, and has been the only
            such Rule since it and Rule 1929 'Points' were 
enacted.  Therefore,
            any notification of the occurrence of such an event implicitly
            specifies Rule 1930 as the Rule allowing the Award or Penalty."
           7/30  Called by Murphy
           7/31  Assigned to Blob
           8/2   Blob dismisses
           8/13  Appealed by Murphy
           Caller's argument (summary):  Hardly anyone seems to be explicitly
             specifying Rule 1930, yet (per Game Custom) Scores change anyway.
           Judge's reason for dismissal (summary):  The first two parts are
             true, but the truth of the third part varies depending on whether
             the current Scorekeepor is implicitly aware that Rule 1930 is the
             Rule in question.
           Counterargument:  At the time this CFJ was called, the Scorekeepor
             was thus implicitly aware.

CFJ 1239  "Taral objected to both the making of the Proposal 'Secret, Unknown
[TRUE]     and Hidden Proposals 2.1' disinterested and objected to the making
            of the Proposal 'Respect for the dead' disinterested in eir 
message
            dated 'Mon, 31 Jul 2000 11:33:18 -0500 (CDT)', subject 'Re: BUS:
            disinterested'."
           8/1  Called by Peekee
           8/1  Mistakenly assigned to Palnatoke, who is On Hold
           8/1  Reassigned to Steve
           8/1  Steve Judges TRUE
           Caller's argument (summary):  Taral's message said "I object.  These
             are..." after quoting Peekee's announcement of intent to make both
             Proposals Disinterested.

CFJ 1240  "Kelly is not the Judge of CFJ 1234."
[FALSE]   8/8      Called by Kelly
Appealed  8/9-14   Assigned to t, who Judges FALSE
           8/14-17  Appealed by Steve, Palnatoke, Kelly, Taral, Wes, and Peekee
           8/15     Appeal assigned to Chuck, Taral, and Wes
           8/18     Chuck makes emself ineligible

CFJ 1241  "Chuck has committed the Class 4 Crime of Contempt by Inaction by
[FALSE]    failing to abide by the Order issued by the Judge of CFJ 1237."
           8/6     Called by Taral
           8/7-11  Assigned to Peekee, who Judges FALSE
           Caller's argument (summary):  Timing requirement of the Order is
             implicitly ASAP.  Chuck actually did obey the Order in time, but
             Taral didn't catch it till after calling the CFJ.
