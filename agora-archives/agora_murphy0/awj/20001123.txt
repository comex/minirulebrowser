REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Away With the Chaff Already" by Elysion
  Repeal Rules 1949 (Continuity of Debt) and 1943 (Continuity of the Bank),
    which have already served their purposes.

"Fix Roles" by Blob - Proposal 4087
  Fix a typo ("On Politicians") introduced by "Playing Roles".

"Fix the Notary" by Murphy
  Notary is once again defined as being an Office.
  The Gamestate becomes what it would have been if Notary had been defined as
    being an Office since January 1, 2000.

"No Income for Zombies" by Steve
  Zombies no longer receive Minimum Income.

"Reduce Lone Voter Bonus" by Elysion
  Being the only Player to Vote FOR or AGAINST someone else's Proposal is worth
    3 Points, not 10.

"Repair Rule 1927" by Andre
  The Recordkeepor (not "Executor") of a Bank Currency may mint it, subject to
    restrictions.

"Tweak Rule 1016: By Popular Demand" by Elysion - Proposal 4086
  Rule 1016 (Putting Oneself On Hold) is simplified.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Fix Roles II" by Oerjan
  Peekee's Oligarch bid is amended from 1 VT to 1 Stem.
  Organizations are reimbursed in Stems for eir previous Basic Currency
    holdings.
  Organizations may transfer their Stems to Players, but only within seven days
    of obtaining them.

"Fix Rule 1458" by harvel
  Notary is once again defined as being an Office.

CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ ????  "Novalis and Harlequin are not Zombies."
          11/16  Called by Andre
          Caller's argument (summary):  The Zombies have sent messages to the
            Public Forum (e.g. to Vote), which makes them cease to be Zombies.
          Counterargument (summary):  The PF messages are sent by the Zombies'
            Executors, not the Zombies themselves.

CFJ ????  "Peekee possesses at least one Voting Token."
          11/20  Called by Murphy
          Caller's argument (summary):  Murphy attempted to create a Voting
            Token and transfer it to Peekee.
          Counterargument (summary):  Even if the creation succeeded, the
            Voting Token cannot be possessed or transferred, because the Rules
            do not explicitly define it as being Property.


OFFICES/OLIGARCHS
-----------------

11/13  Taral is Elected Speaker-Elect.

       Michael is Elected Registrar.

       Murphy is Elected Scorekeepor.

       Michael determines that Proposal 4002 (adopted May 8, 2000) amended the
         Rules so that Notary was no longer defined as being an Office.

11/20  Low Oligarch Auction ends.  Peekee was the only bidder (1 VT).  The
         status of this Auction is unclear, now that Proposal 4085 has
         abolished VTs.

       Murphy attempts to create a Voting Token and transfer it to Peekee.

11/21  Auction begins for one Low Oligarch position.  Bids are in Stems
         (minimum 1 Stem).  Due to the typo in "Fixing Roles", non-Politicians
         may still bid.

11/22  Steve announces eir intent to delegate the Office of Justiciar from
         January 1 through January 9.
