CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1125  "Rule 1883 has not been repealed."
[TRUE]    4/24       Called by Blob
Sustained 4/26-30    Assigned to Crito, who Judges TRUE
          4/30-5/30  Appealed by Steve, elJefe, and Kolja A.
          6/7        Appeal assigned to Blob, Steve, and Michael
          6/10-20    Michael, Blob, and Steve move to sustain
          Caller's argument (summary):  "An Object Lesson" was embedded
            in a spam message, so did not give a "clear indication" of
            being a Proposal as required by Rule 1483.

CFJ 1137  "If a CFJ alleging that a Player has committed a Crime is
[TRUE]     initially Judged FALSE, and that decision is later reversed
           by a Board of Appeals, it is the duty of the original Judge
           to issue the Sentencing Orders associated with conviction of
           that Crime."
          5/25  Called by Chuck
          6/9   Assigned to Crito
          Caller's argument:  none
          Judge's confirmation (summary):  Rule 1693 deems such a CFJ
            to have been Judged normally, with the Judgement being that
            made by the majority of the Board.

CFJ 1138  "Morendil's transfer of one Kudo from Wes to Chuck was
           invalid due to a lack of a valid justification for doing
           so."
          5/28     Called by Wes
          6/15-16  Assigned to Chuck, who makes emself ineligible

CFJ 1139  "Judges are required to follow the reasons and arguments of
[FALSE]    past Judges and Justices when judging CFJs."
          6/14     Called by Blob
          6/14-20  Assigned to Steve, who Judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Such reasons and arguments are
            part of "game custom, commonsense, ... and the best
            interests of the game".
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Rule 217 applies only to cases
            where the Rules are silent, inconsistent or unclear.  Rule
            217 only requires consideration, not agreement.

CFJ 1140? "If no proposals are distributed in a given week, then every
           player has either voted or declared presence on all
           proposals of that distribution."
          6/15  Called by Elysion
          Caller's argument (summary):  The opposite of the second
            clause is "There is a proposal of that distribution on
            which some player has neither voted nor declared presence",
            which is obviously false when the first clause is true.


OFFICES

5/28  Office of Speaker-Elect becomes held temporarily by Promotor
        Michael, due to Chuck going On Hold.

6/15  Nominations open for Speaker-Elect.
