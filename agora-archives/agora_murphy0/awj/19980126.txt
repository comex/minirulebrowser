     THE AGORAN WEEKLY JOURNAL
     VOLUME 42, ISSUE 17
     Monday edition
     January 26, 1998


PROPOSALS
---------

1/21  Murphy Proposes "Plots", and protoes (and later re-protoes)
        "Who's In Probate".

      Oerjan protoes "Limit Rewards Not Wins".

1/22  Steve protoes "Changing Nomic Properties", intended to prevent
        all such changes not triggered by some Player action.

      General Chaos re-protoes "The Omnibus Reform Act of 1998".

      Murphy protoes "Yet Another Probate Fix", which would fix some
        lingering references to Executors in Probate.

      Morendil Proposes "One More Probate Fix", which would define
        a "terminal estate" as one that would be destroyed if Rule 1601
        didn't require it to go through Probate first.

      Voting on Proposals 3664-3669 ends.  The following are adopted:
        3664 [Steve]         Repeal VT Supply
        3665 [General Chaos] Synonymity
        3666 [General Chaos] Award Oerjan the Title of Exorcist
        3668 [Kolja A.]      ROM proposal readability

1/23  Steve protoes "Apologies and Appeals".

      elJefe protoes "Repeal Probate", which would actually just
        drastically simplify it:  the Notary transfers as much Currency
        to the Bank as possible, destroys the rest, and vacates any
        relevant Payment Orders.

1/26  elJefe protoes "Time Requirements".

      The Repeal-O-Matic Proposes to repeal Rule 1763 (Inadvertent
        Transfers to the Bank II)

1/27  Steve protoes "Block successive Revolts".

      BethMo notes that "Plots" forgot to specify that the payee of
        Maintenance Fees must be the Bank, and possibly allows
        Blueprints to produce Rule-defined Currencies.
