ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Clean up R408" by Steve - Proposal 4076 (second one) adopted 10/6
   Judging Late occurs seven days after the end of the Deliberation Period
     only if the Judge did not return Judgement or dismiss by that time.

"Fix Rule 408" by Harlequin (on behalf of the Mute Chuck) - Proposal 4077
     adopted 10/9
   Judging Late occurs seven days after the end of the Deliberation Period
     only if the Judge did not return Judgement or dismiss by that time.

"Remove some anomalous references" by Steve - Proposal 4075 (second one)
     adopted 10/6
   Rebellion refers to Electees, rather than to Offices held "in the normal
     fashion" or "temporarily".

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

"Expand Presence" by Blob - Proposal 4075 (first one) failed quorum 10/4
   Oligarchs may declare Presence on Ordinary Proposals.

"Votes over Points" by Taral - Proposal 4076 (first one) failed quorum 10/4
   Only Player to Vote FOR/AGAINST a Proposal is worth 2 (not 10) Points.

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Budgeted Stipends" by Elysion
    The Winner's Stipend is made part of the Treasuror's Budget.

"Fix Kudos and Remove a Rule" by Elysion
   Kudos are explicitly made non-Property.
   Definition of Shogun is merged into Rule 1923 (Defined Unique Patent 
Titles).

"Tweak Rule 1016" by Elysion
   Rule 1016 (Putting Oneself On Hold) is shortened.  Also, the 96-hour limit
     applies to both going On Hold and going Off Hold.


PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Improved Oligarchy" by Steve
   There may be extra Low Oligarchs, temporarily.
   Speakership is merged into a laundry list of other disqualifications.
   Zombies may not bid in Oligarch Auctions.
   Bidder who becomes Speaker or Speaker-Elect has eir bids cancelled.
   All Auction winners start as Low Oligarchs.
   The Grand Warden shall announce an Auction winner taking eir position
     within three days of eir winning bid being paid.
   If a vacancy occurs during an Auction, it shall be filled by a subsequent
     Auction.
   Oligarchs are selected for promotion only when all six positions are full.
   The Grand Warden shall announce the need for selection within three days,
     unless the selection is made before e does so.
   One-choice selections occur automatically.
   Multiple-choice selections are made by majority, or by plurality after
     three days have elapsed.  If three days elapse without a plurality, then
     the Speaker has one week to choose, or else become Tainted; if the
     Speakership changes hands during that week, then the duty transfers and
     the one-week timer starts over.
   If a vacancy occurs during a selection, then the selection is cancelled.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1243  "Chuck is ineligible to serve as a Justice in the Appeal of CFJ
[TRUE]     1237."
Appealed  8/21     Called by Steve
           8/22-24  Assigned to Wes, who Judges TRUE
           8/25-26  Appealed by Andre, Crito, harvel, Oerjan, and Kelly
           8/25     Andre creates and signs an Application to Submit an
                      Opinion, to force the official recording of eir
                      Dissenting Opinion
           8/25     Crito signs Andre's Application
           8/27     harvel and Steve sign Andre's Application
           8/28     Andre submits and executes eir Application
           8/30     Appeal assigned to Chuck, Taral, and Andre
           9/22     Chuck, Taral, and Andre dismissed from Board; t, Kelly,
                      and Blob assigned to Board
           9/29     Kelly moves to overturn and reverse
           10/6     t and Blob dismissed from Board; Elysion and pTang
                      assigned to Board
           10/6     pTang moves to overturn and reverse
           10/8     Elysion moves to overturn and reverse; a verdict of TRUE
                      would indicate that Elysion is ineligible to serve on
                      this Board
           Caller's argument (summary):  Chuck made emself ineligible to Judge
             CFJ 1237 on August 1.  When CFJ was called, Chuck was ineligible
             only due to Rule 1871, which does not affect the Board.  However,
             there may be some Rules that use "Judge" to include Justices too.
           Counterargument (summary):  No, there aren't.  The Rules restrict
             the correctness of Judges and Judgements; they restrict Justices
             only to decide whether the Judge did what e should have.
           Judge's concurring opinion (summary):  The object of "it" in Rule
             911's "when it was called" is "the Appeal".
           Counterargument (summary):  No, the object is "the CFJ".  The time
             that an Appeal is called is undefined anyway, though it would
             presumably be the earliest time at which there exist sufficient
             insistences on Appeal.  Rule 541 iii) and iv) use "the matter
             the Board is to consider" - a phrase similar to one in Rule 911
             - in apparently inconsistent ways, but this is resolved if the
             phrase is interpreted as "the Judicial process regarding a given
             CFJ".  Transferring that interpretation to the context of Rule
             911, the only sensible interpretation of "when a Judicial process
             was called" is "when the original CFJ was called".

CFJ 1247  "t's Order dated Wed, 20 Sep 2000 22:50:26 +0300 was improperly
[TRUE]     executed."
           9/20     Called by Taral
           9/27     Improperly assigned to Wes, who requested ineligibility
           10/6-10  Assigned to Crito, who Judges TRUE and (Rule 1809) vacates
             the Order
           Circumstances:  t's first version of "Stable Oligarchy" lacked
             sufficient Power, due to an error in the Ruleset.  t re-submitted
             it with appropriate Power, and ordered (Rulekeepor and Promotor)
             Chuck to make it Distributable.
           Judge's argument (summary):  Any Private Order is improper unless
             specifically authorized (by the Rules, or a SLC with jurisdiction
             over both the author and the recipient of the Order).

CFJ 1248  "Rule 1941 shall be interpreted as outlined in pTang's judgement on
            CFJ 1246."
           9/28  Called by pTang
           10/6  Mis-assigned to t, who requested ineligibility
           10/10 Assigned to Murphy
           Caller's argument (summary):  This CFJ is intended to trigger Rule
             789 (Orders to Annotate Rules) and force annotation of Rule 1941.

CFJ 1249  "The paragraph of Rule 1664 which reads
[TRUE]
             'The Registar shall select a random integer from 1 to the number
              of Players (plus 1 if Miscreant is held) at the time of the Call
              for Revolt.  If this number is less than or equal to the number
              of Rebellious Players (plus 1 if Miscreant is held by a
              Rebellious Player), then the Revolt succeeds; otherwise it
              fails.'

            should be interpreted such that, while the total number of Players
            is determined as of the time of the Call for Revolt, the number of
            Rebellious Players is determined as of the time the Registrar
            selects a random integer as described.
           10/2    Called by Chuck
           10/6-9  Assigned to Peekee, who Judges TRUE
           Judge's argument (summary):  Anything pertaining to the Registrar's
             selection should be measured at the time of that section, unless
             explicitly specified otherwise (e.g. the total number of Players
             as of the time of the Call for Revolt).

CFJ 1250  "Rule 1664 should be interpreted that the effects which are applied
[TRUE]     specifically to Abiding Players or specifically to Rebellious
            Players upon the success or failure of a Call for Revolt, are
            applied based on a Player's status as Abiding or Rebellious at the
            time the Registrar determines whether the Call for Revolt was
            successful or not, and not at the time the Call for Revolt is
            made."
           10/2     Called by Chuck
           10/6-10  Assigned to Crito, who Judges TRUE
           Judge's argument (summary):  Anything pertaining to the Registrar's
             selection should be measured at the time of that section, unless
             explicitly specified otherwise (e.g. the total number of Players
             as of the time of the Call for Revolt).

OTHER
-----

10/7   Speaker Murphy pays out the Patronage attempted by then-Speaker Chuck
          on 10/3, thus validating the Stem transfer already executed.

        Murphy transfers eir Indulgences to Robespierre and tax shelter
        Novalis.

10/10  Taral makes emself eligible to Judge future CFJs.

        Steve makes emself eligible to Judge CFJs.

10/11  Everyone but Peekee, Wes, and Anthony is Rebellious.  The Rebellion
          succeeds.  Everyone is now Abiding.

10/13  Indulgence tax is levied:

          0.7 of 1.0 - Andre       - paid 10/14
          3.6 of 4.8 - Michael
          1.5 of 2.0 - Palnatoke   - paid 10/13
          0.9 of 1.2 - Peekee
          2.2 of 3.0 - Schneidster - paid 10/13
          4.9 of 6.6 - Wes         - paid 10/13

        Wes attempted to Rebel, and to make Anthony Rebel, in a-d (but e may
          have clearly indicated PF intent; thus, if all Players were
          subscribed to a-d at the time, then it counted as PF).

10/14  Accountor Oerjan ratifies eir Report of 10/10.

        Payroll Clerk Andre unofficially announces eir intent to levy a 30%
          Tax on Stems, excluding 75 Stems per Player.  (Rule 1917 "General
          Currency Taxation" attempts to allow such an exclusion, but Rule
          1853 "Levying Taxes" may prohibit it.)
