"Auction Indulgences as a block" by harvel (on behalf of Steve)
  Each month, a number of Indulgences is Auctioned as a single item.

"Deference Deprecation" by harvel - Proposal 3950
  Remove "defer" or some form of it from Rules 459, 1023, 1556, 1874,
    1728, 1795, 1439, 1614, and 1531.

"Fix 1893" by Blob
  Remove an obsolete reference to the Chancellor.

"Fix Altruism" by Elysion (on behalf of Murphy)
  An Order requiring a Player to do something by a certain time does
    not trigger Contempt by Inaction if the Order is satisfied in some
    other way before that time.
  Half of Murphy's Blots are expunged.

"Real Rebels" by Elysion - Proposal 3951
  Rebels keep eir Offices after a successful Revolt.
  Rebels pay no taxes.
  Rebelliousness can be changed only once per month.
  Inciting to Riot is checked at the beginning of each month, is 2
    Blots, and is applied to all Rebellious players.
  The Indulgence tax resulting from a successful Rebellion is applied
    by the Herald (not the Registrar), and does affect that Rebellion's
    Rebels (but not Robespierre).

"Secret, Unknown and Hidden Proposals" by Peekee
  Secret Proposals have secret Priority till Distribution.
  Unknown Proposals have secret text till Distribution.
  Hidden Proposals have secret existence between submission and
    Distribution.
  Each of these increases the Proposal's Priority Cost by 1.

"Ssh, It's a Secret" by Blob
  Information defined by the Rules as Secret is private with respect to
    the Freedom of Information Act, and revealing it is a Crime unless
    explicitly permitted or required by the Rules.
  If the mode of voting is Private or Unrestricted, then votes cast
    privately are secret until the Voting Period ends.

"Voters and Legislators" by Peekee
  Fix denial of Voting Privileges.
  Add a Legislative Status of Mute which prevents one from Proposing.


PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Events with a Sole Purpose" by Peekee
  An event may be defined as having one or more Sole Purposes, but at
    most one can be fulfilled each time that event occurs.

"Group Proposals" by Peekee
  Interested Proposals submitted by a Group may be Group Proposals, in
    which case only Groups can Vote on them, and Quorum is 2 Groups.

"Group Votes and Proposals" by Peekee
  Groups with at least three members are Voters and Legislators, but
    are considered Barred for the Voting Periods of Proposals that
    began before the Group existed.

"Important proposals" by t
  Failing to vote on an Important Proposal is an Infraction.

"The Agoran Journal" by Peekee
  There is the Office of Journalist, whose report has no Rule-specified
    content.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1174 "The PO's issued by Payroll Clerk Lee in the email sent to
[FALSE]   agora-official time/date stamped Fri, 05 Nov 1999 16:36:15
          -0600 were improperly executed, due to the fact that e had
          already executed PO's for the same purpose in the email sent
          to agora-discussion time/date stamped Fri, 05 Nov 1999
          12:15:27 -0500."
         11/5        Called by Wes
         11/5-9      Assigned to Elysion, who Judges TRUE
         11/23       Appealed by Murphy, Crito, and Elysion
         11/23-12/3  Appeal assigned to Kolja A., lee, and t, who
                       unanimously overturn
         Appelate refutation (summary):  Payment Orders issued as part
           of an Officer's work are Administrative Orders, which can
           only be executed by posting them to the Public Forum.

CFJ 1180 "Peekee successfully raised the Priority of eir Proposal 'Secret
[FALSE]   Proposals' repeatedly in the message titled 'Priority Increase'
          with 'Message-Id: <199911181025.KAA09187@renko.ucs.ed.ac.uk>'
          as sent to the PF on the 18th of November 1999."
         11/19     Called by Peekee
         11/20-23  Assigned to Murphy, who Judges FALSE
         Caller's argument (summary):  Increasing a Proposal's Priority
           by the same amount multiple times is still a single purpose.
         Judge's argument (summary):  No, it isn't.  Those are multiple
           events and thus multiple purposes.

CFJ 1181 "Players are under no obligation to pay any 'printing fee',
[TRUE]    and Murphy's Private Orders in the Agoran Journal are
          therefore improperly executed."
         11/10     Called by Palnatoke
         11/23-25  Assigned to Peekee, who Judges TRUE

CFJ 1182 "All of these Private Orders were improperly executed:
[TRUE]    * Payment Order PO0018 for 0.1 Indulgence from me to Palnatoke
            Message-ID: <005601bf2b2b$46d02f20$35d652c3@opus>
          * t's Order for me to give em one of my Kudos
            Message-ID:
<Pine.LNX.4.10.9911020015420.25836-100000@itu.st.jyu.fi>
          * harvel's Order for me to vacate Payment Order PO0006 for 0.1
            Indulgence from em to me
            Message-Id: <199910311223.HAA21045@msuacad.morehead-st.edu>"
         11/23     Called by Murphy
         11/23-24  Assigned to t, who Judges TRUE and vacates the Orders

CFJ 1183 "The Infraction of Debt Voting cannot be committed by any Player."
[FALSE]  11/26     Called by Steve
Appealed 11/28     Assigned to Wes, who Judges FALSE
         11/28-29  Appealed by Steve, harvel, and Blob
         12/2      Appeal assigned to Kolja A., Elysion, and Murphy
                     [Kolja A. requested not to Judge the CFJ, so e may
                      have to be replaced on the Board of Appeals]
         Caller's argument (summary):  Voting POs are executed for the
           direct purpose of billing for votes, not paying for them;
           thus Rule 1824 fails to identify such POs (as intended) as a
           trigger for Debt Voting.
         Judge's refutation (summary):  Voting POs are executed for the
           eventual purpose of causing votes to be paid for.
