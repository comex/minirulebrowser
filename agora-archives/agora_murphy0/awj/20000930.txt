      VOLUME 47, ISSUE 6
      September 30, 2000


ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"GWotO Runs Oligarch Auctions" by Elysion - Proposal 4073 (third one) 
adopted 9/26
   The Grand Warden of the Oligarchy (not the High Oligarch or Speaker)
     conducts Auctions to fill Oligarch vacancies.

"Pragmatic Auctions" by Elysion - Proposal 4074 adopted 9/26
   When the Priest determines how many Indulgences should be auctioned,
     errors made in good faith are allowed to stand.

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

"Stable Oligarchy" by t - Proposal 4073 (second one) rejected 9/23
   The High Oligarch is not rotated out if there were any vacancies in
     the Oligarchy during the past week.
   (Lacked sufficient Power to make this amendment.)

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Expand Presence" by Blob - Proposal 4075 (first one)
   Oligarchs may declare Presence on Ordinary Proposals.

"Fix Rule 408" by Harlequin (on behalf of the Mute Chuck)
   Judging Late occurs seven days after the end of the Deliberation Period
     only if the Judge did not return Judgement or dismiss by that time.

"Remove some anomalous references" by Steve - Proposal 4075 (second one)
   Amend Rule 1664 (Rebellion) as intended by "Improved Officer Rules" (which
     had insufficient Power to do so).

"Votes over Points" by Taral - Proposal 4076
   Reduce the award for the only FOR/AGAINST Proposal Vote from 10 to 2 Points.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Entitlements" by Peekee
   For a Currency with an Entitlement Factor:
     Entitlement Factor is a positive amount of Currency per Player.
     Ideal Circulation Level = number of Players * Entitlement Factor, rounded
       up to nearest MUQ.
     Actual Circulation Level = non-Bank holdings, plus Bank holdings won in
       Auction but not yet paid for.
     Circulation Level Surplus = max(0, ICL - ACL).  This amount shall be
       Auctioned at the beginning of each month, in the Bidding Currency for
       that Currency.
   For Indulgences:
     ICL = number of Players + number of Player Blots.
     Bidding Currency = IATs.
   For Papyri:
     Entitlement Factor = 0.2 to 4, contained in Promotor's Budget.
     Bidding Currency = P-Notes.
     Promotor's Budget also contains Quorum Repayment (0 to 1 Papyri, paid out
       to the author of a Proposal that fails Quorum).
   For VEs:
     Entitlement Factor = 1.
     Bidding Currency = VTs.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1243  "Chuck is ineligible to serve as a Justice in the Appeal of CFJ
[TRUE]     1237."
Appealed  8/21     Called by Steve
           8/22-24  Assigned to Wes, who Judges TRUE
           8/25-26  Appealed by Andre, Crito, harvel, Oerjan, and Kelly
           8/25     Andre creates and signs an Application to Submit an
                      Opinion, to force the official recording of eir
                      Dissenting Opinion
           8/25     Crito signs Andre's Application
           8/27     harvel and Steve sign Andre's Application
           8/28     Andre submits and executes eir Application
           8/30     Appeal assigned to Chuck, Taral, and Andre
           9/22     Chuck, Taral, and Andre dismissed from Board; t, Kelly, and
                      Blob assigned to Board
           9/29     Kelly moves to overturn and reverse
           Caller's argument (summary):  Chuck made emself ineligible to Judge
             CFJ 1237 on August 1.  When CFJ was called, Chuck was ineligible
             only due to Rule 1871, which does not affect the Board.  However,
             there may be some Rules that use "Judge" to include Justices too.
           Counterargument (summary):  No, there aren't.  The Rules restrict
             the correctness of Judges and Judgements; they restrict Justices
             only to decide whether the Judge did what e should have.
           Judge's concurring opinion (summary):  The object of "it" in Rule
             911's "when it was called" is "the Appeal".
           Counterargument (summary):  No, the object is "the CFJ".  The time
             that an Appeal is called is undefined anyway, though it would
             presumably be the earliest time at which there exist sufficient
             insistences on Appeal.  Rule 541 iii) and iv) use "the matter
             the Board is to consider" - a phrase similar to one in Rule 911
             - in apparently inconsistent ways, but this is resolved if the
             phrase is interpreted as "the Judicial process regarding a given
             CFJ".  Transferring that interpretation to the context of Rule
             911, the only sensible interpretation of "when a Judicial process
             was called" is "when the original CFJ was called".

CFJ 1246  "Peekee has paid a Fee of 10 Stems since the 15th of September this
[FALSE]    year."
           9/19     Called by Peekee
           9/19     Blob makes emself ineligible
           9/20     Peekee bars Crito
           9/21     Taral makes emself ineligible
           9/27-28  Assigned to t, who makes emself ineligible
           9/28     Assigned to pTang, who Judges FALSE
           Caller's argument (summary):  Peekee transferred 10 Stems to the
             Bank for the purpose of "Paying a Fee of 10 Stems", then later
             stated sixty times that e wished to obtain 10 IATs.  Eir intent
             was to have only one Fee (of 10 stems) simultaneously associated
             with all of these wishes, and thus to obtain a total of 600 IATs.
           Judge's refutation (summary):  Each wish has its own Fee, and the
             10-Stem payment was not for the sole purpose of paying any
             particular one of those keys, so it did not pay any Fee.

CFJ 1247  "t's Order dated Wed, 20 Sep 2000 22:50:26 +0300 was improperly
            executed."
           9/20  Called by Taral
           9/27  Assigned to Wes (who says e was ineligible at the time)
           Circumstances:  t's first version of "Stable Oligarchy" lacked
             sufficient Power, due to an error in the Ruleset.  t re-submitted
             it with appropriate Power, and ordered (Rulekeepor and Promotor)
             Chuck to make it Distributable.


OFFICES/OLIGARCHS
-----------------

9/27  All Oligarchs except Michael lose eir positions due to Blots.  Speaker
         Chuck promotes Michael to High Oligarch.

9/29  Kelly is Elected Clerk of the Courts.

       t is Elected Treasuror.


OTHER
-----

9/26  pTang creates a Contest named "the Arena":
         Bribe Tokens (BTs) are a Currency.
         A Crony on an Issue is a Player willing to sell eir Vote on it.
         A Potential Buyer on an Issue is a Player willing to buy a Vote
           on it.  E is randomly assigned to a Crony (if any) on that Issue,
           and the Referee announces a cost of (2 * some integer) BTs for
           the Potential Buyer to become a Buyer.
         If a Buyer's Voting request is matched by eir Crony, then the Crony
           gets half the BTs paid by the Buyer.  Otherwise, the Buyer gets
           all eir BTs back, and the Crony may be neither a Crony nor a
           Buyer on any future Issue till the Referee says otherwise.
         Upon the announcement of a Fight Night, the Referee declares a
           prize structure, each Player may submit one contestant, and the
           Referee makes up the results of a single-elimination tournament.

       pTang announces a Fight Night to occur on midnight October 3.

         * 1 BT for entering
         * 1 BT per round won
         * 1 BT for making the finals (2 if there are at least 8 contestants)
         * 1 BT for winning the finals (2 if there are at least 8 contestants)

9/27  Chuck invokes the bug in Rule 408 that makes Players guilty of
         Judging Late seven days after the end of the Deliberation
         Period, even if Judgement was previously delivered (see CFJ
         1240), to assign Blots as follows:

            Oerjan - 3
            Andre, Crito, harvel, Murphy, Taral - 6 each
            Blob, Peekee, t, Wes - 9 each
            Kelly, Steve - 12 each
            Elysion - 15

       Unaffected are Chuck emself, Michael, Palnatoke (On Hold),
         pTang, and the Zombies.

       Chuck then announces eir intent to Call for Revolt around
         midnight October 3, advising the Blotted Players to Rebel
         before then (so as to lose eir Blots) but after midnight
         October 1 (so as not to be dinged for Inciting to Riot).

       The CFJs triggering the bug are 1191, 1194-1195, 1198-1203,
         1207-1208, 1211-1212, 1214, 1217-1223, 1226-1227, 1230-1231,
         1233-1234, 1236-1242, and 1244.  (Elysion and Oerjan were
         both dinged for CFJ 1237.)

       Steve presents the contestant of Oophos the Chaotic Attractor.

9/28  t, Taral, and Steve make emself ineligible to Judge CFJs.

9/29  Peekee presents the contestant of Bob the Assumption.
