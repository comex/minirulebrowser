        eir COE regarding Harlequin's Win.


ERRATA
------

An Ackanomic CFJ claims that Malenkai did not deregister.  If judged
  true, then Malenkai is still InterNomic moderator, and his attempt to
  appoint Uri Bruck his successor was ineffective.  (It has indeed been
  judged true, but that verdict also means that Malenkai is still
  Ackanomic Clerk of the Courts, and thus that the judge delivering the
  verdict was selected illegally by the Clerk-of-the-Courts-if-
  Malenkai-were-not-a-player.)
