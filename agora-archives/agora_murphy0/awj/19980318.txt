     THE AGORAN WEEKLY JOURNAL
     VOLUME 43, ISSUE 1
     Wednesday edition
     March 18, 1998


PROPOSALS
---------

3/9   Voting on Proposals 3703, 3705-3707, and 3710 has ended.  The
        following are adopted:
          3703 [Steve]     Speaker Transition Reform

          3710 [Swann]     The Great Officer's Veto Scam

      Proposal 3710 was not distributed in the form in which it was
        Proposed; Promotor Blob accidentally removed a ">".  This may
        mean that the Proposal was not distributed at all, or that it
        was distributed except for the affected clause, or that the
        text distributed by Promotor Blob takes full effect despite its
        difference from the Proposal submission.

      Sherlock re-protoes "The Miscreant".

      Steve Proposes "Indelible Proposal Voting".

      Kolja A. Proposes "Zeitgeist and scarce currencies".

      Swann Proposes "A minor Score Fix" and protoes "Non-Pejorative
        Elective Tools".

3/13  General Chaos re-protoes "The Industrial Revolution".

      Swann re-protoes "Non-Pejorative Elective Tools".

3/14  The Repeal-O-Matic Proposes the repeal of Rule 1665 (Abuse of
        Responsibility).

CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1086 [Morendil] Judgement:  FALSE
         2/23-3/6  Assigned to Harlequin, who Judges FALSE
         3/5       Harlequin commits the Infraction of Judicial
                     Inactivity by going On Hold, but remains Judge.
         "The Proposal submitted by Crito with title Cantus Cygneus,
          claimed to be a Silly Proposal, is not, in fact, a Silly
          Proposal."

CFJ 1087 [Antimatter]
         3/9  Assigned to Morendil
         "The last sentence of Rule 1766 prevents the remainder of
          that rule from granting additional votes."

CFJ 1088 [Morendil]
         3/9  Called
         "When a Proposal is declared to be a Senate Proposal, and
          Votes were previously cast on such a Proposal by Entities who
          were not Senators, such Votes are nevertheless still legal
          Votes and should be taken into account for the purpose of
          determining Voting results."

All times are in GMT.

All delegations except Promotor are to avoid a bug in Rule 1486
(Procedure to Impeach an Officer), which says "Adoption Ratio is 2" and
not "Adoption Ratio must be 2 for the Referendum to pass" or similar
language.  All ten of Sherlock's Referenda to Impeach reached Quorum
and therefore passed, though none with the 2-to-1 ratio intended by the
author of Rule 1486.  This bug was worked around by postponing the
announcement of results till all ten Offices were delegated, causing
the passage of the Impeachment Referenda to have no effect.

  Cartographor, Chancellor, Clerk of the Courts, Commander-in-Chief,
  Scorekeepor, Speaker-Elect, and Wizard:

      "If two more of the 4 currently Rebellious Players (Harlequin,
       Sherlock, Morendil and Time Agent) will agree to become Abiding,
       so pushing the prospect of another Revolt further into the
       distance, then I will use my Speaker's Right to Call Elections
       to free up some of the Offices held by the Threat, namely,
       Scorekeepor, Commander-in-Chief and Archivist.  Bearing in mind
       that Crito will soon be Elected Accountor (General Chaos is not
       really contesting the Election), this will reduce the number of
       Offices held by the Threat from 10 to 6, basically restoring
       the political balance."

      Sherlock becomes Abiding.

      Chuck becomes Rebellious.

        was distributed, at least in part.)

3/13  Sherlock goes On Hold.
