CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT

CFJ 1157  "Denying is synonymous with voting AGAINST."
          8/15     Called by Peekee
          8/16-28  Assigned to Beefurabi, who defaults
          8/28     Assigned to Kolja A.

CFJ 1159  "In the context of a vote denying is synonymous with voting
[FALSE]    AGAINST."
          8/16     Called by Peekee
          8/16-23  Assigned to Chuck, who Judges FALSE

CFJ 1161  "If all rules were repealed then any rule could be created
[DISMISS]  with anyone's command."
          8/26     Called by Tom Mueller
          8/26-28  Assigned to Elysion, who dismisses the CFJ

CFJ 1162? "The phrase 'We hereby perform whatever actions are necessary
           to cause X to happen' unambiguously indicates intent to
           perform said action."
          8/24  Called by Wes

CFJ 1163  "The Priority of #235 "Removal of Blob's Coolness" is 1.0."
          8/28  Called by Wes

          Caller's argument (summary):  Its Priority was 0.9, but Rule

ERRATA
------

Peekee points out that Rule 1752 (Group Votes), which attempts to limit
  Group Voting in several ways, is overruled by the lower-numbered Rule
  1547 (Some Organizations Can Vote), which simply states that any
  Organization that is a Voting Enty can Vote.
