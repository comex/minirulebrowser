CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1143  "The Order of the Evil Eye has been dissolved."
[FALSE]   6/20     Called by Murphy
          7/2      Assigned to Beefurabi, who defaults
          7/9-12   Assigned to Elysion, who Judges FALSE
          7/17     Appealed by Murphy
          Caller's argument (summary):  This statement assumes that
            when Crito stepped down as High Priest, e ceased to be
            Vizier; and that Harlequin submitted the Group's ACO.  If
            both are correct, then the statement follows from Rule 721.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  The Group's Ordinances do
            specify the identity of the High Priest, thus the Vizier.
