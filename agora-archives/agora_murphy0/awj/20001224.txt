ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Rebellion Reform" by Elysion - Proposal 4091 adopted 12/11
  Patent Title of Pugachev given to last Player to initiate a failed Revolt.
  Political Status (Abiding or Rebellious) is defined in a Power=2 Rule.
  Inciting to Riot is not penalized while a Revolt is unresolved.
  Successful Revolt cancels any Indulgence Auction in progress.

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

"Fix Rule 1868" by Elysion - Proposal 4092 failed quorum 12/18
  The Clerk of the Courts must select and announce a Judge under a single ASAP
    requirement, rather than two separate and successive requirements.

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Enough Already!" by Elysion
  Repeal Rules 1949 and 1943, both of which have long since had their one-time
    effects.

"Fix Rule 1840" by Elysion
  Penalties prevented due to a unresolved Revolt are imposed upon the failure
    of that Revolt.

"Make Stems Transferrable" by Blob
  Stems may be transferred to any entity.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Duty of the Oligarchy" by Taral
  When the Voting Period of an Ordinary Proposal ends, an Oligarch commits the
    Class 2 Infraction of Otiosity if e was eligible to Vote on it, has been an
    Oligarch for the entire past two weeks, and has not Voted on any Ordinary
    Proposal during that time.

"Fix Ratification" by Steve
  Rule 1550 (Ratification) no longer prohibits the Ratification of an Official
    Document by the operation of an instrument other than an adopted Proposal.

"Fix Rule 1458" by harvel
  Notary is once again an Office.
  Any actions performed by Blob or Peekee, ostensibly as Notary, shall be
    allowed to stand.

"Longer Holidays" by Steve
  The Christmas Holiday is extended to begin on December 24 and continue
    through the entire Nomic Week containing January 2.
  Holidays may last up to 17 days.

"Oerjan's Fix Roles" by Elysion
  Organizations may transfer Stems to Players, but only within seven days after
    obtaining them.
  The Bank owes 241 Stems to lee, 114 Stems to the Agoran Carnival, and 37
    Stems to the Order of the Evil Eye.  These debts compensate those entities
    for debts in VTs, P-Notes, or IATs, which were not previously converted to
    Stems.
  Rule 1936 (Auctioning Positions in the Oligarchy) has the typo "On
    Politicians" replaced by "Only Politicians".

"Various Minor Changes" by harvel
  Rule 1728 (Dependent Actions) is cleaned up, and .
  Rule 514 (Keep the Registrar Notified of Your Address) is cleaned up.
  Rule 1042 (Zombification Due to Silence) is defined by defining "Noiseless"
    (a Player alleged to have abandoned) and "Noisemaker" (the allegator).
  Rule 1755 (No Non-Player Responsibilities) has "paragraph" replaced with
    "forgoing [sic] provisions".
  Rule 1884 (Zombie Masters) is cleaned up.
  Rule 1886 (Returning to Life) is renamed "Vivification Due to Noise", and is
    cleaned up.

CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1251  "Kelly has failed to select a Judge for the CFJ called by Peekee on
Dismissed  November 11, and Kelly is not the CotC."
          12/15  Called by Elysion; attempted to file with Justiciar, but
                   unsuccessful because Kelly was not CotC (see CFJ 1256) and
                   thus Rule 1831 could not be triggered
          12/17  Assigned to Blob, who dismisses the CFJ
          Judge's argument (summary):  Peekee did not call a CFJ on November 11
            (e called one on November 7).

CFJ 1252  "Peekee has a Will."
          11/7  Called by Peekee
          Caller's argument (summary):  Peekee had a Will when Wills last
            ceased to be defined by the Rules.  Now Wills are once again
            defined by the Rules.  Is "Peekee's Will" still an entity?  If so,
            is it once again a Will?

CFJ 1253  "Novalis and Harlequin are not Zombies."
          11/16  Called by Andre
          Caller's argument (summary):  The Zombies have sent messages to the
            Public Forum (e.g. to Vote), which makes them cease to be Zombies.
          Counterargument (summary):  The PF messages are sent by the Zombies'
            Executors, not the Zombies themselves.

CFJ 1254  "Peekee possesses at least one Voting Token."
          11/20  Called by Murphy
          Caller's argument (summary):  Murphy attempted to create a Voting
            Token and transfer it to Peekee.
          Counterargument (summary):  Even if the creation succeeded, the
            Voting Token cannot be possessed or transferred, because the Rules
            do not explicitly define it as being Property.

CFJ 1255  "Rule 1586 should be interpreted such that the Rule created by
           Proposal 4090 (Debt Conversion) has no effect, since any
           outstanding debts and liabilities in Basic Currencies were
           canceled when Basic Currencies were abolished from the Rules."
          12/8  Called by Oerjan
          Counterargument (summary):  Only the Currencies themselves were
            abolished; debts referring to those Currencies continued to exist.

CFJ 1256  "Peekee submitted at least one CFJ to the Clerk of the Courts
[TRUE]     during November 2000; the Clerk of the Courts has not assigned
           a Judge to any such CFJ; and Kelly is not the Clerk of the Courts."
          12/18     Called by Murphy; filed with Justiciar
          12/18-19  Assigned to Wes, who Judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  First and second clauses are simple
            fact, included to allow filing with the Justiciar.  Third clause
            depends on whether the Referendum to Impeach Kelly as CotC was
            successful.  Its success was announced, first by Andre (who had
            previously deregistered and thus ceased to be Vote Collector), then
            by Speaker Murphy (in case Rule 1434 made em Vote Collector).
          Judge's argument (summary):  All Votes were received by Andre before
            e deregistered, and Rule 1434 does not require the announcement of
            results to come from the Vote Collector, so Andre's announcement
            was effective even though e was no longer Vote Collector.

CFJ 1257  "Peekee is an Oligarch."
          12/18  Called by Murphy
          Caller's argument (summary):  While Peekee paid eir bid late, e still
            paid it, and thus became an Oligarch.

CFJ 1258  "Peekee is the Notary."
          12/18  Called by Murphy
          Caller's argument (summary):  Notary ceased to be an Office on 5/8,
            at which time Blob held it.  Had it remained an Office, a
            subsequent Election would have transferred it to Peekee.  Can that
            alleged Election be interpreted as effective anyway?

         any Indulgence taxes unless e is required to do so.

12/21  Papyrus Auction ends.  Elysion wins 5, Steve wins 3, and Kelly wins 2,
         at 66 Stems per Papyrus.  Elysion and Steve pay immediately; Kelly

ERRATA
------

If a Rule says "The Speaker may do X", then is X an operation of the Rule or
of the Speaker?  If the former, then Rule 1791 (Ratification Without Objection)
is trumped by Rule 1550 (Ratification).  If the latter, then Rule 1934 (The
Speaker and Democratic Proposals) fails to trigger Rule 1933 (c) (Ordinary and
Democratic Proposals).  Case law holds that Ratification Without Objection
works; thus, the Speaker making an Ordinary Proposal Democratic does not work.
