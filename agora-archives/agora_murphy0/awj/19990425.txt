CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1124  "Votes sent to the agora-discussion mailing list are neither
           'sent publically' nor 'sent privately', and so are not valid
           when voting is Unrestricted."
          4/20  Called by Blob
          4/20  Assigned to Elysion
          Caller's argument (summary):  By defining the Public and
            Private modes of Voting, Rule 1764 defines "publically" and
            "privately".  Messages to a-d fit neither definition.

CFJ 1125  "Rule 1883 has not been repealed."
          4/24  Called by Blob
          Caller's argument (summary):  "An Object Lesson" was embedded
            in a spam message, so did not give a "clear indication" of
            being a Proposal as required by Rule 1483.
