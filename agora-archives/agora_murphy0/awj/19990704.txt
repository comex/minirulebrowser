CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1138  "Morendil's transfer of one Kudo from Wes to Chuck was
[FALSE]    invalid due to a lack of a valid justification for doing
           so."
          5/28     Called by Wes
          6/15-16  Assigned to Chuck, who makes emself ineligible
          6/21-30  Assigned to Beefurabi, who Judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  The statement intended by
            Morendil to be eir justification is demonstrably false.
          Judge' refutation (summary):  The statement of justification
            need not be true.

CFJ 1143  "The Order of the Evil Eye has been dissolved."
          6/20  Called by Murphy
          7/2   Assigned to Beefurabi
          Caller's argument (summary):  This statement assumes that
            when Crito stepped down as High Priest, e ceased to be
            Vizier; and that Harlequin submitted the Group's ACO.  If
            both are correct, then the statement follows from Rule 721.
