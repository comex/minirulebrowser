Summary of Proposals
--------------------

"Bookkeping Reduction" by Blob
  Basic Officer Salary set by Treasuror, not Chancellor.
  Officeholders tracked by Payroll Clerk, not Registrar.
  Bank debts are paid by Currency Recordkeepors, not Chancellor.

"Cleaning Up the Queue" by Wes
  Zero-Priority Proposals may be removed after two weeks, not a month.

"Decimalize MUQs" by Peekee
  Require all MUQs to be an integral power of ten.

"Fix Rule 1886" by Murphy
  Rule 1886 is "Returning to Life".
  Replace "pay" with "pay out to", which was clearly intended.

"Get rid of (P-Notes)^2" by Peekee
  Change Proposal Costs from amounts of P-Notes to simple numbers,
  which was clearly intended.

"Indulgence Reform" by Elysion
  Gain 1 Indulgence for being Immaculate all quarter.
  Receive 1 Indulgence per Zombie you own.
  Players with 5+ Blots may not Nominate in an Election.
  Players with 10+ Blots may not Propose.
  Players with 15+ Blots may not Vote.
  List of Rebels is no longer required to be called the Red Pages.

"Legislative Status" by Wes
  Entities may have one or more Legislative Statuses (Voter, Proposer,
    Barred).
  Denial of Voting privileges is accidentally broken:  Entities with a
    Status of Barred are not prevented from Voting.

"Legislative Status Fix" by Wes
  Fix denial of Voting privileges.

"Perstemify Bonus for Repeal" by harvel
  In Rule 947 (Bonus for Repeal), replace the remaining "1 P-Note" with
    "30 Stems", which was clearly intended.

"Voters and Legislators" by Peekee
  Groups with at least three members may Propose.
  Fix denial of Voting privileges.
  Add Legislative Status of Mute, which prevents one from Proposing.

CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1172 "The Private Orders issued by Murphy in the message with
          subject 'BUS: Agoran Weekly Journal' dated Sun, 31 Oct 1999
          were improperly executed."
         11/1  Called by Crito
         11/4  Assigned to Chuck
         Caller's argument (summary):  "improperly" is undefined by the
           Rules, but there was no good reason for these Orders.

CFJ 1173 "Any TO which is successfully received by the Recordkeepor for
          the Currency being transfered is properly executed, even if
          it was redistributed by means of the agora-discussion mailing
          list."
         11/5  Called by Wes
         11/5  Assigned to Crito

CFJ 1174 "The PO's issued by Payroll Clerk Lee in the email sent to
          agora-official time/date stamped Fri, 05 Nov 1999 16:36:15
          -0600 were improperly executed, due to the fact that e had
          already executed PO's for the same purpose in the email sent
          to agora-discussion time/date stamped Fri, 05 Nov 1999
          12:15:27 -0500."
         11/5  Called by Wes
         11/5  Assigned to Elysion

CFJ 1175 "Peekee changed his ABC to P-Notes, in a message with,
          Message-Id: <199911051747.RAA18759@renko.ucs.ed.ac.uk> sent
          on Fri, 5 Nov 1999 17:47:29 +0000."
         11/6  Called by Peekee
         Caller's argument (summary):  Peekee set eir ABC on August 29,
           and attempted to change it on November 5.  Rule 1911 (Basic
           Currencies) requires a three-month wait.  Rule 459 (The
           Nomic Week) says that monthly events occur on the first of
           the month, so "three months" have in fact elapsed.


OFFICES
-------

11/3  Nominations open for Registrar.

11/4  Michael and Peekee Nominate for Registrar.


OTHER
-----

11/1  Elysion makes elJefe Quiet.

11/5  elJefe goes On Hold (and, ironically, becomes Noisy again by
        doing so).

      Wes attempts (unsuccessfully) to leave The Magical Sheltor and
        thus dissolve it.
