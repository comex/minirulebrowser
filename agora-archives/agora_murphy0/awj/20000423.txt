CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1206 "Peekee did not gain 2 Blots due to Tardiness, because of Oerjan's
[FALSE]   Probate."
          4/1      Called by Peekee
          4/2-7    Assigned to Sherlock, who Judges TRUE
          4/9      Appealed by Steve, Wes, and lee
          4/10-14  Appeal assigned to Chuck, Blob, and Murphy, who unanimously
                     move to overturn and reassign
          4/14-15  Reassigned to Anthony, who becomes a Zombie
          4/16-18  Reassigned to else...if, who Judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1908 (Automatic Dispensation)
            requires the Notary to perform certain actions in order, and
            Rule 1023 (Definition of ASAP) explicitly allows its timing
            requirements on Official duties to be changed by other Rules.
            Furthermore, the Notary cannot perform certain actions required
            by Rule 1908, because Oerjan is no longer in Probate.
          Counterarguments:  Wes's claim of Tardiness is sufficient to Blot
            the Notary.  Peekee transferred a total of 94 VTs from Oerjan,
            but Oerjan had 124 VTs per the Accountor's Report of 3/25, so
            Peekee was indeed Tardy; and this is a cause of eir being Blotted,
            albeit possibly an indirect cause.  Rule 1908's ordering
            requirement is in addition to (not instead of) the normal timing
            requirements of ASAP.  The Notary's inability to perform an action
            does not prevent em from being required to perform it, unless the
            Rules explicitly say so.

CFJ 1207 "An Official Report ratified according to Rule 1791 (Ratification
[FALSE]   Without Objection) is ratified by an Officer, not by Rule 1791
           itself. Rule 1791 is an Instrument, but Officers are not
           Instruments, so Rule 1550 (Ratification) does not attempt to
           prohibit this method of ratification."
          4/13     Called by Murphy
          4/13-14  Assigned to Wes, who Judges FALSE
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Rule 1791 attempts to allow the
            Speaker to Ratify Reports, possibly without holding any Office,
            so the first sentence is not always true.

CFJ 1208 "The Herald's Report was last ratified after 01Feb2000"
[TRUE]   4/14     Called by Elysion
          4/16-19  Assigned to Blob, who Judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Elysion allegedly ratified the
            Herald's Report, Without Objection, on 2/14.  Kelly and Wes
            argue that Rule 1552 (Requirements for Ratification), by
            declaring a document legal to ratify "at the time the Proposal
            which would ratify it is Proposed", implies that no document
            is legal to ratify when no such Proposal exists.
          Judge's opinion (summary):  When no such Proposal exists, Rule
            1552 is void, and Rule 101 then makes any document legal to
            ratify.

CFJ 1209 "The change to the minimum wage on March 30, 2000 was invalid
           and the subsequent minimum wage PO's were incorrect."
          4/17  Called by lee
          4/17  Assigned to Chuck
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1893 (The Treasuror's Budget)
            requires the Minimum Income to be an integer multiple of 0.1
            times the Basic Officer Salary, but the attempted change on
            3/30 was to 0.25 times the Basic Officer Salary.

         Salary from 75 to 38 Stems, and double all figures (Officer

         terms of the BOS.  Taral gives Support, and lee makes the change.
       (The Minimum Income is changed to 0.5 times the BOS.  This is based
         on its alleged previous value of 0.25 times the BOS, which may
         not have been valid; see CFJ 1209.)

       Treasuror lee announces eir intent to increase the Basic Officer

         change it back to 2, but Rule 1839 (The Promotor Can Change
