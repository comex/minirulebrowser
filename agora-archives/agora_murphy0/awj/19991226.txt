CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1183 "The Infraction of Debt Voting cannot be committed by any Player."
[FALSE]  11/26     Called by Steve
         11/28     Assigned to Wes, who Judges FALSE
         11/28-29  Appealed by Steve, harvel, and Blob
         12/2-9    Appeal assigned to Kolja A., Elysion, and Murphy,
                     who move to SUSTAIN in a split decision
         12/20     CFJ 1188 finds that Kolja's assignation to the Board
                     was incorrect
         12/20-23  lee assigned to Board and moves to SUSTAIN
         Caller's argument (summary):  Voting POs are executed for the
           direct purpose of billing for votes, not paying for them;
           thus Rule 1824 fails to identify such POs (as intended) as a
           trigger for Debt Voting.
         Judge's refutation (summary):  Voting POs are executed for the
           eventual purpose of causing votes to be paid for.

CFJ 1188 "Kolja A. should not have been assigned to the Board of Appeals
[TRUE]    for CFJ 1183."
         12/12     Called by Murphy
         12/12-16  Assigned to harvel, who Judges TRUE
         Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 911, clause iv.
         Journalist's notes:  Kolja was ineligible to Judge CFJ 1183 by
           request.  Many other Players were ineligible solely due to
           Rule 1871 (Turns for All), which contradicts 911/iv's claim
           that those Players are ineligible for the Board.  (Rule 1871
           wins this conflict by claiming precedence.)

CFJ 1189 "A Proposal cannot be distributed by a Player other than the
[TRUE]    Promotor, unless the Rules explicitly allow or require em to
          do so."
         12/15     Called by Murphy
         12/20-21  Assigned to lee, who Judges TRUE
         Caller's argument (summary):  Rules 1011 (Definition of Nomic
           Property) and 1770 (Distributiong Proposals).

CFJ 1190 "The Private Payment Order executed in this message is
          executed for the purpose of paying for votes, within the
          meaning given to that phrase by the Judgement (sustained on
          Appeal) in CFJ 1183."
         12/25  Called by Steve
         Caller's argument (summary):  Steve intends to continue
           executing such Private Payment Orders until Wes pays for eir
           vote on Proposal 3857.  This can be interpreted (in at least
           a couple of ways) as having the indirect purpose of making
           Wes pay for that Vote, and CFJ 1183 sets precedent that Rule
           1824 recognizes indirect purposes.
