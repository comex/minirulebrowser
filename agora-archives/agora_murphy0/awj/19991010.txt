Summary of Adopted Proposals
----------------------------

Proposal 3921 "Eliminate Rules Conflicts I" by Wes
  The Voting Period for Urgent Proposals is defined without using
  precedence of Rules over other Rules.

Proposal 3922 "Urgent Proposals Revisited" by Wes
  Urgent Proposals may be distributed immediately.

Proposal 3924 "Simplify Registration" by Wes
  Rule 869 is reworded to not use deference of Rules to other Rules,
  and has Rule 1432 merged into it.

Proposal 3925 "Simple Cleanup" by Wes
  Error correction:  Rule 1893 requires the Chancellor (not Treasuror)
  to post the Budget to the PF.  Rule 1607's text contains a repetition
  of its title.

Proposal 3926 "Free Indulgence Fixes" by Crito
  Parts of "Free the Indulgence!" which accidentally failed.  Blots may
  be expunged by Judicial or Appelate Orders, or by a Player who
  reported a Blot penalty and later found it to be in error.

Proposal 3927 "Minor Changes II" by harvel
  Rule 1691 (which is redundant; see Rule 1048) is repealed.
  Rules 1722 and 1471 are given clearer titles.
  Indices are explicitly defined as Nomic Properties.

Proposal 3928 "Finish Registrar's Crayons" by Elysion
  Parts of "The Registrar's Crayons" which accidentally failed.  The
  list of Rebels is no longer required to becalled "the Red Pages".
