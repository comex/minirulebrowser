ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Budgeted Stipends" by Elysion - Proposal 4081 adopted 10/25
   Winner's Stipend is part of the Treasuror's Budget.
   Payroll Clerk (not Registrar) pays out the Distributor's Gratuity.

"Fix Kudos and Remove a Rule" by Elysion - Proposal 4079 adopted 10/25
   Kudos are no longer Property.
   The definition of Shogun is merged into Rule 1923 (Defined Unique Patent
     Titles).

"Improved Oligarchy" by Steve - Proposal 4084 adopted 11/7
   When there are less than six Oligarchs, the GWotO Auctions vacancies.  (If
     new vacancies occur during the Auction, they are ignored till the current
     Auction ends.)
   When there are six Oligarchs and more than three Lows, the GWotO has three
     days to publish a list of Oligarchs, selectors, and valid selections.
   When there is no High, the Lows select a Middle (or, if none, a Low) to
     become High.
   When there is a High and less than two Middles, the High selects a Low to
     become a Middle.
   A lone candidate is selected automatically.
   When there are competing candidates, each selector has three days to 
announce
     eir selection.  A majority results in immediate selection; other selectors
     need not announce eir selection.  At the end of the three days, a 
plurality
     suffices. If there is no plurality, then the Speaker has seven days to 
make
     the selection, or else e becomes Tainted. If the Speakership changes hands
     while such a requirement is in effect, then the new Speaker has seven days
     to make the selection. Failure of anyone to make a selection as described
     here is the Infraction of Oligardiness.
   A vacancy cancels any selection in progress.

"Respect for the dead" by Peekee - Proposal 4082 adopted 10/25
   Wills are once again recognized.
   Property may not be transferred according to an entity's Will until all eir
     debts in that type of Property are satisfied.

"Stable Oligarchy" by t - Proposal 4083 adopted 10/25
   High Oligarch rotation is delayed till after a week with no vacancies in the
     Oligarchy.

"Tweak Rule 1016" by Elysion - Proposal 4080 adopted 10/25
   [Following effects fail because Elysion did not request AI=2.]
   Rule 1016 (Putting Oneself On Hold) is simplified.
   96-hour limit now applies to going On Hold after coming Off Hold.

"Tweak Rule 1016 (With Correct AI)" by Elysion
   Rule 1016 (Putting Oneself On Hold) is simplified.
   96-hour limit now applies to going On Hold after coming Off Hold.

"Tweak Rule 1016: By Popular Demand" by Elysion

     the Office at the time.

CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ ????  "Peekee has a Will."
           11/7  Called by Peekee
           Caller's argument (summary):  If entities that were Wills (last time
             Wills were defined) are now Wills again, then this is
