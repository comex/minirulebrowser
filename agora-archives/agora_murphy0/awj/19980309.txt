     THE AGORAN WEEKLY JOURNAL
     VOLUME 42, ISSUE 23
     Monday edition
     March 9, 1998


PROPOSALS
---------

3/3  The following Proposals are distributed:
=A0=A0     3698 [Kolja A.]=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0Buying points
=A0=A0  =A0=A0 3704 [General Chaos]=A0The Omnibus Reform Act of 1998
=A0=A0  =A0=A0 3709 [Steve]=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0Groups can vote in =
Referenda
=A0=A0   =A0 3710 [Swann]=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0The Great Officer's =
Veto Scam Proposal
=A0=A0  =A0=A0 3713 [Blob]=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0Risky Rebellion

     Proposal 3710 would close two loopholes (after using them to give
       Wins to Swann and the Threat):  First, Rule 1766 (Officer's
       Veto) lets Officers cast two extra Votes on Proposals affecting
       their duties; Proposal 3710 would amend this Rule to allow only
       two extra AGAINST Votes.  Second, an instrument may create (or
       empower the creation of) another instrument with higher Power
       than its own.

     Speaker Steve has noted that this Scam was the true motivation
       for the Threat to gain the Speakership:  without it, the
       Speaker could deny the relevant Officers their two extra votes
       each, by Calling for Elections (and thus causing the Officers
       not to hold Office in the normal fashion).

3/4  Steve protoes "Indelible Proposal voting".

3/5  Speaker Steve declares Proposal 3710 a Senate Proposal.

     Antimatter protoes "Birthrights".

3/6  General Chaos re-protoes "The Industrial Revolution".

3/8  Murphy protoes "Repair Probate" and re-protoes "Plots".

     The following Proposals are distributed:
    =A0=A0 3700 [Swann]=A0         Ratification w/o Objection
    =A0=A0 3701 [Swann]=A0         (Proposal Applications)
    =A0=A0 3702 [Repeal-O-Matic]=A0Repeal Rule 113 (Players may always =
opt out)
    =A0=A0 3714 [Crito]         =A0Limited Indulgence Distribution
    =A0=A0 3715 [Blob]=A0=A0         Standing Down

3/9  Sherlock re-protoes "The Miscreant".


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1086 [Morendil]
         2/23  Assigned to Harlequin
         3/5   Harlequin commits the Infraction of Judicial Inactivity
                 by going On Hold while a Judge.  However, e remains
                 Judge until 3/9, unless e is recused before then.
         "The Proposal submitted by Crito with title Cantus Cygneus,
          claimed to be a Silly Proposal, is not, in fact, a Silly
          Proposal."

CFJ 1087 [Antimatter]
         3/7  Called
         "The last sentence of Rule 1766 prevents the remainder of
          that rule from granting additional votes."


PROBATE
-------


OFFICES
-------

Recent Elections:
  Accountor - Crito leads General Chaos unanimously; voting ends 3/14
  Registrar - Michael is Elected

3/3  Sherlock calls for the Impeachment of ten Offices (plus the
       Speakership, which isn't an Office).  This begins a Referendum
       for each Office.

3/6  Morendil makes an excellent analysis of what will happen if
       Speaker-Elect Blob is impeached:
         * Rule 1647 says the Speaker can't be S-E.  Rule 1555 says e
           can, and takes precedence.
     Assuming that a Revolt occurs shortly thereafter:
         * Speaker and S-E Steve would have to perform Rule 402's
           ceremonial handshake with emself, after which S-E Steve
           would "become" Speaker.
         * Before that could happen, S-E would come to hold Office
           temporarily.  Thus, when e "became" Speaker, e would be
           Tainted.  This would trigger an Election for S-E, with the
           winner becoming (non-Tainted) Speaker.
     However, this turns out to be incorrect, due to the recently =
adopted
       Proposal 3703.  Actually, S-E Steve would immediately "become"
       Speaker, before the Revolt caused all Offices to become held
       temporarily; and Promotor Crito would become temporary S-E.


INTERNOMIC
----------

2/24  INP 360 is adopted.

      Agora will vote for INP 363.

3/2   INPs 361 and 362 are rejected.


OTHER
-----

3/4  elJefe becomes Shogun.

3/5  Antimatter registers.

3/6  Kolja A. and Swann become Abiding.

3/9  Kolja A. submits a Bachelor of Nomic Thesis.


ERRATA
------

Rule 1486 (Procedure to Impeach an Officer) does define an effect of
the Impeachment of an Officer, namely that the Officer is removed from
that Office (which then falls temporarily to the Speaker).
