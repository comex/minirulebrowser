PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"CFJ Streamlining" by Wes
  A CFJ's Deliberation Period explicitly begins with the CotC's
    announcement of a Judge.
  A Player fined for Judging Late becomes ineligible to Judge further
    CFJs, till e requests otherwise in the PF.
  A Player is fined for Judging a Bit Late even if e Judges or dismisses
    the CFJ before the CotC can apply the fine.
  A Judge ceases to be assigned to a CFJ if e becomes ineligible for
    any reason.
  Failing to grant or deny a Motion within a week is grounds for the CotC
    to Recuse and assign a new Judge.
  A Motion for a closed case whose Judge is no longer an Active Player
    is assigned to a new Judge.

"Important Proposals" by t - Proposal 3960
  Proposals in the Queue may be made Important with 2 Supporters.
  Failing to Vote on an Important Proposal is an Infraction, unless you
    were unable to Vote on it, or were On Hold when the Voting Period
    began.  The Infraction is larger if the Proposal fails Quorum.

"Return of the Unsigned VT" by Steve
  +VTs and -VTs are re-combined into a single Currency.

"Stem Conversion Rates" by t
  Each Basic Currency has an Exchange Rate (adjustable weekly by the
    Payroll Clerk) that determines how much of that Currency one
    receives in exchange for a given amount of Stems.

"Voters and Legislators" by Peekee - Proposal 3961
  Fix denial of Voting Privileges.
  Add a Legislative Status of Mute which prevents one from Proposing.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Assortment of Minor Changes" by harvel
  Remove "explicitly or implicitly" from Rule 101.
  Properties modifiable by Rule-defined procedures are Nomic Properties.
  Nomic Entities are any non-Player entities recognized by the Rules.
  Sending a message to all other Players (not including oneself, but
    including Inactive Players) is sufficient to constitute the Public
    Forum (if it was clearly intended to do so).
  Rule 1688 (Power) is made more terse.

"Fix Holidays" by Murphy
  Paragraphs have their own specific precedence clause, rather than the
    entire Rule having a single complicated precedence clause.
  Cases where an original event begins before a Holiday, but a Holiday
    begins before the dependent event occurs, are covered.
  Cases such as "to Vote effectively, one is required to do it within
    such-and-such time period" are covered.
  Any overlap between a cause-and-effect time period and a Holiday
    causes the duration between cause and effect to be extended by
    the amount of overlap.

"Wins, Wins, Wins" by Wes
  Points are a Currency, transferred only when the Rules explicitly allow
    or require that Points be Awarded or Penalized.
  Points are transferred only if someone points out the relevant event
    and Rule within 7 days.
  Having at least 200 Points is a Win Condition, upon which all Points
    are destroyed and all Point POs are vacated.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1192 "Clerk of the Courts Wes violated Rule 1769 when he
[TRUE]    distributed the Official Judgement of CFJ 1183 on December
          26, 1999, during the Christmas Holiday designated by Rule
          1870."
         12/26     Called by Kelly
         12/27-30  Assigned to Palnatoke, who Judges TRUE
         1/2       Judgement Appealed by Wes, t, and lee
         1/2       Judicial Order appealed by Wes
         1/2       Appeal of Judicial Order assigned to Blob, Elysion,
                     and Wes
         1/6       Wes appoints harvel to replace em in Appeal of
                     Judgement; harvel consents
         Judge's commentary (summary):  ASAP means "within 7 days", and
           a Holiday is never longer than 7 days, so it is always
           possible to do something according to the usual definition
           of ASAP without doing it during a Holiday.
         Reporter's commentary:  Wes had approximately a 29.5-hour
           window - between the submission of the Judgement of CFJ 1183
           and the beginning of the Christmas holiday - during which e
           could legally have published the Judgement.  What would
           Lindrum say about this?  Murphy has protoed a fix.

[old]
CFJ 1190 "The Private Payment Order executed in this message is
          executed for the purpose of paying for votes, within the
          meaning given to that phrase by the Judgement (sustained on
          Appeal) in CFJ 1183."
         12/25  Called by Steve
         12/26  Assigned to Michael
         Caller's argument (summary):  Steve intends to continue
           executing such Private Payment Orders until Wes pays for eir
           vote on Proposal 3857.  This can be interpreted (in at least
           a couple of ways) as having the indirect purpose of making
           Wes pay for that Vote, and CFJ 1183 sets precedent that Rule
           1824 recognizes indirect purposes.
