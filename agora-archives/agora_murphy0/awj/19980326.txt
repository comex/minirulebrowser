       distance, then I will use my Speaker's Right to Call Elections

       Scorekeepor, Commander-in-Chief and Archivist.  Bearing in mind
       that Crito will soon be Elected Accountor (General Chaos is not
       really contesting the Election), this will reduce the number of
       Offices held by the Threat from 10 to 6, basically restoring
       the political balance."
