Editor's note:  Evidence pertaining to CFJ 1232 would *still* be
much appreciated, as it would allow the Journal's description of
same to be considerably more informative.


      THE AGORAN WEEKLY JOURNAL
      VOLUME 46, ISSUE 21
      July 2, 2000


ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Speaker Delegation" by Taral - Proposal 4022 adopted 6/25
   The Speaker may delegate any Office e holds, even if e is not its
     Electee.

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

"Conversion fix fixed" by Taral - Proposal 4021 failed quorum 6/25
   Stem conversions are rounded down to an integer multiple of the MUQ
     of the Currency being converted to.

[Curmudgeon's Review - summary:  Useless unless the MUQ of Stems is
  changed from 1, or a Basic Currency has a MUQ not in the form 1/X
  where X is an integer - both unlikely.]

"Regain Sanity" by Steve - Proposal 4020 failed quorum 6/25
   Only Rules with Power >= 2 may prevent Players from Voting on
     Democratic Proposals.
   Rule 1723 (Sanity) has its Power increased to 2.

[Curmudgeon's Review - summary:  Has no effect if Proposal 4018 is
  adopted first.  Otherwise, could be implemented more simply by
  removing Rule 206's exception clause, increasing Rule 1723's Power
  to 2, and making Rule 1723 claim precedence over Rules preventing
  Players from Voting on Sane Proposals.  (However, this method would
  have the undesired effect of allowing, say, Players Denied due to
  Blots to still Vote on Sane Proposals.)]

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"72 Hours" by t
   Auctions end after 72 (not 24) hours with no new winning Bids.

"Agoran Time" by t - Proposal 4024
   Agora uses GMT (no daylight savings time).
   Weeks, months, quarters, years, relative times, and periodic
     requirements are defined.

"Remove Leftover Baggage" by Elysion
   Repeal the now-unused definition of Maximum Votes.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Cleanup of Dismissals" by Murphy
   A Judgement of DISMISSED may be delivered at any time, but should
     only be delivered for certain reasons.  (If no such reasons apply,
     then such a Judgement should be overturned on Appeal.)
   "Lacks standing" is reserved for CFJs which should be dismissed for
     some reason other than being irrelevant or undecidable.  Such
	    reasons include Excess CFJs, Double Jeopardy CFJs, CFJs alleging
     Judge wrongdoing (one should Appeal instead), and CFJs alleging
     the violation of a private agreement not involving the Caller.

"Innocent until proven guilty, redux" by Murphy
   Judging FALSE a CFJ declaring a Player innocent of a Rule violation
     or Crime is subject to the same restrictions as Judging TRUE a CFJ
     declaring a Player guilty of same.

"More Fully Baked Oligarchy" by Kelly
   The Speaker Auctions all Oligarch vacancies.
   If a vacancy occurs during an Auction, it is Auctioned separately,
     after the current Auction ends.
   All winners become Low Oligarchs.
   When there are six Oligarchs, but not the usual 1H/2M/3L split:
     * New High is chosen by Middles (or, if no Middles, Lows).
     * New Middle(s) are chosen by High.
     * Choices must occur within three days, or else fall to the Speaker.
     * Speaker's choices must occur within seven days, or else e becomes
         Tainted.  If the Speakership changes hands, this duty transfers.
     * Failing to choose on time is the Class 2 Infraction of Oligardiness.

"The Medici" by harvel
   The Medici keeps track of Offices and Oligarchs.  E controls Elections,
     announces Speaker Transitions, and detects Dereliction of Duty.

"Whitespace in Rules" by Kelly
   The Rulekeepor may adjust whitespace for formatting reasons (this is
     not a Rule Change), provided that e does not alter the meaning of a
     Rule, split or join words or paragraphs, or alter a Rule written in
     verse.
   Paragraphs added to a Rule are bounded by at least one blank line, and
     smaller texts added to a Rule are bounded by at least one blank space,
     unless the Rule Change clearly indicates otherwise.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

6/26  Wes states that a CFJ ought to be overturned and reassigned when:

         1) The Judge made an error on a point of law, such as failing to
            take a relevant Rule into account, missing crucial evidence, or
            other such omissions which could substantially alter Judgement.

         2) The Judge made a Judgement call which the Justice feels is
            unreasonable. This is not to say that the call could have gone
            either way and the Judge chose one or the other, but rather the
            Justice feels strongly that the call should have gone one way
            due to clear and motivating reasons.

       E also states that a CFJ ought to be overturned and reassigned when
       all three Judges agree strongly on what the Judgement should have
       been, and there is some noticeable disadvantage to reassigning (such
       as an unresolved game state for a protracted period of time, or a
       high probability of repeat Appeals).

CFJ 1229  "Taral distributed at least one Proposal during the Nomic Week
            beginning May 29, 2000."
           6/14     Called by Taral
           6/14-17  Assigned to Elysion, who Judges FALSE
           6/17-22  Appealed by Murphy, Taral, and lee
           6/22     Appeal assigned to Wes, lee, and Murphy
           6/26     Wes moves to sustain
           6/28     Murphy moves to overturn and reassign
           6/29     lee moves to overturn and reassign
           6/29     Reassigned to Chuck
           Caller's argument (summary):  E sent it, but its delivery was
             delayed due to a mail server crash.
           Judge's refutation (summary):  Late delivery does not cause
             earlier sending.
           Counterargument:  Earlier sending is just that.  Receipt is a
             separate event.
