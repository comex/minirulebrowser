ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

"Abandoned Proposals Drop Faster" by Wes - Proposal 3983 failed quorum 3/8
   Priority of Proposals still in the Queue drops by a minimum of 5 after each
     distribution.

"Be Nice to the Payroll Clerk" by lee - Proposal 3985 failed quorum 3/13
   Repeal Rule 1939, which accidentally requires the Payroll Clerk to pay Trade
     Fellowships out of eir own funds - which e *cannot* do, because 
Fellowships
     are paid in Stems.
   Amend Rule 1893 to not mention Trade Fellowships.

"More Points" by Wes - Proposal 3986 failed quorum 3/13
   A Player who is Blotted for at least seven days continuously may be 
Penalized
     5 Points.

"Secret, Unknown and Hidden Proposals" by Peekee - Proposal 3984
     failed quorum 3/8
   Secret Proposals may have their Priority increased privately.
   Unknown Proposals may be submitted to the Promotor privately.
   Hidden Proposals are not reported as being in the Queue.
   Each of these increases the Priority Cost by 1.

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Agora Abhors a Vacuum" by Murphy - Proposal 3990
   A Proposal distributed while there are no Oligarchs is always Democratic.
   A Proposal made Democratic has its Voting Period extended till seven days
     after it became Democratic.

"Blots Hurt" by t
   Not being Immaculate is a Win-Preventing condition.

"Nomic Entity Reform" by harvel
   Eliminate the phrase "Nomic Entity" from the Rules.

"Regain Sanity" by Steve
   Increase Rule 1723 (Sanity) to Power=2.
   Amend Rule 206 (Voters) so that the right of Players to Vote on Democratic
     Proposals can only be restricted by a Power>=2 Rule (which in turn can 
only
     be enacted by Democratic Proposal).

"Streamline Actions With Support" by Steve
   Actions With Support may be performed as soon as the needed Support is 
given.

"Harsher Blot Penalties" by Elysion - mistakenly distributed as Proposal 3988;
still in the Proposal Queue
    Proposing rights are revoked at 5 (not 10) Blots.
    Voting rights are revoked at 3 (not 15) Blots.
    Nominating for Office is revoked at any number of Blots (not 5 or more).
    Lawlessness occurs after 20 (not 30) Blots.
    The Crime of Persecution is Class 15 (not 20).
    The Crime of Speaker Abandonment is Class 15 (not 20).

"Probate fix" by Peekee - Proposal 3987
   Rule 1601 (Probate) no longer bothers to define "estate" or "terminal".
   Rule 1637 (Wills) replaces "Executor in Probate" with "Notary", and "divide"
     with "assign".
   Rule 1908 (Automatic Dispensation) is tinkered with.
   Rule 1757 (Implementation of Probate Plans) is repealed.

"Quick Minting When It Is Needed" by t - Proposal 3989
   When no units of a Bank Currency exist, its Mintor may Mint it without the
     usual restrictions.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"change the Oligarchy Auctions to work as a single Auction" by Blob
   All vacancies in the Oligarchy are part of a single Auction; vacancies
     occurring during an Auction are simply added to it.  The highest
     Bidder(s) receive the highest positions being Auctioned.

"Compensation" by harvel
   Collect Minimum Income, Salaries, Speaker's Gratuity, New Player's Award
     (now part of the Budget), and Budget amendment into just two Rules.

"Eigentum" by Kelly
   An Eigentum is anything possessible.  Currencies are fungible Eigentum.
   Transfers and debts are no longer Orders.
   "Limited Executor" is defined.
   Creditors may Order the satisfaction of a debt.  Failure to do so within a
     week of the Order is the 1-Blot Infraction of Persistent Indebtedness,
     which continues to be committed weekly while the debt remains.  Such an
     Order shall be appropriately stayed or vacated upon dispute.
   "Offer of Exchange" is defined.
   Probate is replaced by "dissolute entities", and the Notary is given
     discretion to close out the debts of such entities.
   The Bank is re-unified, and each Currency Recordkeepor is made a Limited
     Executor with power over eir own Currency.

"Eliminate the Convenient Time Zone Advantage" by Chuck
   Auctions always end after seven days.
   For each winning Bid, the Bidder is billed the Closing Price.
   If all Bids win, the Closing Price is the Starting Bid.  Otherwise, the
     Closing Price is the highest losing Bid plus 1 MUQ (or just the highest
     losing Bid, if it is the same amount as the lowest winning Bid).

"Forced-Ordinary/Democratic Proposals" by Peekee
   An AI=1 Proposal may be declared Forced-Ordinary upon submission.  This
     increases the Priority Cost by 2, makes it Ordinary and prevents it
     from being made Democratic.
   A Proposal may be declared Forced-Democratic upon submission (unless it
     is declared Forced-Ordinary).  This increases the Priority Cost by 1,
     makes it Democratic and prevents it from being made Ordinary.

"Group Proposals" by Peekee
   A Proposal may be declared a Group Proposal upon submission.  This
     increases the Priority Cost by 1, and only Groups may Vote on such
     a Proposal.
   Groups may give Support to make a Group Proposal Democratic, counting
     as one Player.  Players may still give Support to do so, independent
     of what eir Group (if any) does.
   Quorum for a Group Proposal is 2 Groups.

"Group Votes and Proposals" by Peekee
   Groups with at least 3 members may Vote and Propose.

"Oligarchy Auctions 'in progress'" by Steve
   Oligarchy Auctions are deemed to be in progress until the positions are
     filled (by way of winning Bids being paid), or one week after all
     winning Bids were billed, whichever is first.  Winning Bids not paid
     within a week are vacated, a 2-Blot penalty is assessed, and a new
     Auction is conducted for that position.

"Priority May Be Decreased" by Sherlock
   A Proposal's Priority Cost may be decreased for the same P-Note cost as
     increasing it by an equal amount.

"Secret, Unknown and Hidden Proposals" by Peekee
   Secret Proposals may have their Priority increased privately.
   Unknown Proposals may be submitted to the Promotor privately.
   Hidden Proposals are not reported as being in the Queue.
   Each of these increases the Priority Cost by 1.

"Simplify Power" by harvel
   Rule 1688 (Power) is made more terse.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1197 "Wes violated Rule 1809 when he failed to stay the Payment Order
[TRUE]    denominated as avt583 when Chuck called the CFJ assigned the number
           1193."
          2/23     Called by Kelly
          2/24-26  Assigned to Anthony, who Judges FALSE
          2/26     Appealed by harvel, lee, and Steve
          2/27     Appeal assigned to Murphy, Blob, and harvel
          2/28     Blob moves to overturn and reassign
          3/2      harvel moves to overturn and reassign
          3/2      Murphy moves to overturn and reassign
          3/9-14   Reassigned to Palnatoke, who Judges TRUE
          Judge's argument (summary):  Wes was not Clerk of the Courts on
            February 2, when CFJ 1193 was called.  Clerk of the Courts harvel
            may have made two errors:  assigning CFJ 1193 to Harlequin (on
            February 6) without staying avt583, and reassigning CFJ to Peekee
            (on February 14) without confirming a stay on avt583.
          Board's refutation (summary):  Wes *was* Clerk of the Courts (despite
            not being Electee to that Office) on February 2, so Judge Anthony's
            argument is unsound.

CFJ 1199 "The Rules required the Clerk of the Courts to dismiss CFJ 1198."
[FALSE]  2/27      Called by Murphy
          2/27-29   Assigned to Oerjan, who makes emself ineligible
          2/29-3/6  Assigned to Crito, who Judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1830 attempts to require CFJ 1198
            to be dismissed.  Rule 1565 prevents the Judge from dismissing it,
            and takes precedence over Rule 1830.  Rule 1830 takes precedence
            over Rule 1868, which attempts to require the CotC to assign it.  A
            precedent for CotC dismissal of CFJs is set by Rule 1562, which 
also
            takes precedence over Rule 1868.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  If CFJ 1198 doesn't meet any of the
            reasons for dismissal listed in Rule 1565, then Rule 1565 prevents
            *anyone* from dismissing it.  If CFJ 1198 *does* meet one of those
            reasons, then Rule 1565 allows the Judge to dismiss the 
CFJ.  Either
            way, Rule 1830 is not restricted by Rule 1565 in precisely a way
            that directs the requirement-to-dismiss towards the CotC.

CFJ 1200 "The Auction for Low Oligarchs started on Monday, 06 Mar 2000 at
[TRUE]    23:40:31 -0800 has ended."
          3/15     Called by Blob
          3/16-17  Assigned to t, who Judges TRUE
          3/18     Appealed by Murphy
          Caller's argument (summary):  Wes's alleged Bid of 3/11 affects
            whether the Auction ended on 3/12 or 3/14, but in either case
            it has ended by now.
          Counterargument:  Palnatoke's alleged Bid of 3/12, combined with
            the interaction with the Auctions for Middle and High Oligarchs,
            would have extended this Auction past the time at which CFJ 1200
            was called.

CFJ 1202 "The Auction for Middle Oligarchs started on Monday, 06 Mar 2000
           at 23:40:31 -0800 has ended."
          3/15  Called by Blob
          3/16  Assigned to Elysion
          Caller's argument (summary):  This is FALSE if Wes placed a Bid
            on 3/11, TRUE otherwise.
          Counterargument:  This should be TRUE in any case.  Blob's Bid on
            3/13 was definitely not winning, so Wes's alleged Bid on 3/11
            would not extend the Auction past the time of this CFJ.  Neither
            would Elysion's alleged Bid on 3/11.

CFJ 1202 "23:40:31 -0800 has ended."
[DISMISS]  3/15     Called by Blob
            3/16-17  Assigned to Steve, who dismisses it as irrelevant

CFJ 1203 "The Auction for High Oligarch started on Monday, 06 Mar 2000 at
           23:40:31 -0800 has ended."
          3/15     Called by Blob
          3/15-16  Assigned to Peekee, who proto-Judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  No winning Bids were made since
            harvel's winning Bid on 3/9, even though harvel retracted that
            Bid on 3/11.  Thus, the auction ended on 3/12.

CFJ 1204 "A message that is sent to the email address of a Public Forum
[FALSE]   but not distributed to any Players has not been sent to a Public
           Forum."
          3/16  Called by t, who moves to have Rule 478 Annotated accordingly
          3/16  Assigned to lee, who Judges FALSE and denies the motion
          Caller's argument (summary):  If no Player receives a PF, then
            that PF does not distribute.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  If no Player receives a PF, but at
            least one Watcher receives it, then that PF distributes.  The
            Rules generally require a message to be sent, not received.
