appreciated, as it would allow the Journal's description of same
to be considerably more informative.


      THE AGORAN WEEKLY JOURNAL
      VOLUME 46, ISSUE 20
      June 24, 2000


ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Fix Wins" by t - Proposal 4019 adopted 6/18
   An announcement of a Win must identify all Players eligible to Win
     at that time.

"Property and Democracy" by Kelly - Proposal 4018 adopted 6/18
   Property is a generalization of Currency.  Units of non-Currency
     Property are distinguishable.
   Transfer Orders are replaced with Notices of Transfer.
   Payment Orders are replaced with Debts.
   Debts may be satisfied or forgiven.
   If a Notice of Transfer claims to be for debt payment, but does not
     correspond to any current debt, then it shall either be retained
     as payment against future debt, or returned (voluntarily or on
     demand).
   One may Order the payment of a debt.  Then Persistent Indebtedness
     occurs every seven days till the debt is paid.  Such an Order shall
     be stayed if the debt is disputed (this can also be done by the CotC
     or a Judge), or vacated if the debt is satisfied by another entity
     (this can also be done by a Judge).
   Property owned by an Executor-less entity is Abandoned.  The Notary
     is a Limited Executor of such an entity, and may use its Property
     to pay its debts; forgive debts owed to it; and (Without Objection)
     transfer its Property to the Bank.
   The Bank is a single entity.  The Treasuror is Executor of the
     Bank.  Each Bank Currency's Recordkeepor is a Limited Executor of
     the Bank, and may access only that Currency.
   The Treasuror may forgive debts owed to the Bank when Ordered to do so,
     or Without Objection.
   Ideal Indulgence Circulation Level (IICL) = # Players + # Player Blots.
   Actual Indulgence Circulation Level (AICL) = # Indulgences not owned by
     Bank + # Indulgences auctioned but bids not yet paid.
   Monthly Indulgence Auction for (IICL - AiCL) Indulgences.
   Proposals are Democratic if distributed while there are less than
     three Oligarchs.
   Voting on Ordinary Proposals is free.
   A Player may vote on a Proposal once, plus once per Voting Entitlement
     (a new Currency), minus once per five Blots; minimum 0, maximum 5.
   A non-Player may vote on a Proposal once per Voting Entitlement,
     maximum 3.  However, the Bank may not vote on any Proposal.
   Ideal VE Circulation Level (IVECL) = # Players.
   Actual VE Circulation Level (AVECL) = # VEs not owned by Bank + # VEs
     auctioned but bids not yet paid.
   VE Auction for (IVECL - AVECL) VEs whenever this is positive.  Bids
     in VTs.
   A High Oligarch may retain no VEs, a Middle Oligarch one, and a Low
     Oligarch two.  Possessing more VEs than this for 5 days continuously
     causes loss of Oligarch position.

"Taral's Work for All, Again" by Elysion - Proposal 4017 adopted 4/18
   Players may Nominate for Office, regardless of eir Blots.

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Conversion fix fixed" by Taral - Proposal 4021
   Stem conversions are rounded down to an integer multiple of the MUQ
     of the Currency being converted to.

[Curmudgeon's Review - summary:  Useless unless the MUQ of Stems is
  changed from 1, or a Basic Currency has a MUQ not in the form 1/X
  where X is an integer - both unlikely.]

"Regain Sanity" by Steve - Proposal 4020
   Only Rules with Power >= 2 may prevent Players from Voting on
     Democratic Proposals.
   Rule 1723 (Sanity) has its Power increased to 2.

[Curmudgeon's Review - summary:  Has no effect if Proposal 4018 is
  adopted first.  Otherwise, could be implemented more simply by
  removing Rule 206's exception clause, increasing Rule 1723's Power
  to 2, and making Rule 1723 claim precedence over Rules preventing
  Players from Voting on Sane Proposals.  (However, this method would
  have the undesired effect of allowing, say, Players Denied due to
  Blots to still Vote on Sane Proposals.)]

"Rule cleanup" by Taral
   Repeal Rule 1927 (Bank Currency Creation).

"Speaker Delegation" by Taral - Proposal 4022
   The Speaker may delegate any Office e holds, even if e is not its
     Electee.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"My Votes Are My Own" by Chuck
   When a Candidate Stands Down, any votes for em are cancelled. Those
     voters are deemed to have declared Presence, and may vote again.

"Oh, what a tangled web..." by Kelly
   To grant or revoke PF status to a medium of communication, the Registrar
     must send eir announcement via a single medium that is a PF both before
     and after the change.  Sending it via one medium that is a PF before
     but not after, and another medium that is a PF after but not before,
     is no longer sufficient.
   The Registrar may, Without Objection, grant or revoke Discussion Forum
     status to a medium.  Any medium that becomes a PF ceases to be a DF.
   Sending a message to a DF is not sending it to a given Player, unless
     the Player explicitly or implicitly confirms receipt.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1217  6/17 Appealed by t

CFJ 1224  "Elysion's message of 11 April 2000, reading in part, 'The Bank pays
[FALSE]    all its outstanding IAT POs (50 to Michael and 75 to Chuck)', 
did not
            have the effect of executing a Transfer Order which would 
satisfy the
            Payment Order executed by lee in eir message dated 11 March 2000,
            reading in part, 'I order the Bank to pay Murphy 130 IATs.'"
           5/26      Called by Kelly
           5/29-6/8  Assigned to Sherlock, who defaults
           6/9       Assigned to Chuck
           6/15      Appealed by Wes, Crito, and Steve
           6/18-22   Appeal assigned to Wes, Taral, and lee
           Caller's argument (summary):  Due to a mail server glitch, lee's 
message
             was not generally distributed till May 23.  The falsity of 
this CFJ
             would imply that Elysion paid a Transfer Order without knowing 
that
             it existed.
           Judge's clarification (summary):  The Payment Order sent on March 11
             was not executed till May 23, when it was received by its intended
             recipient.
           Counterargument (summary):  The Payment Order was an Administrative
             Order, and Rule 1808 explicitly states that it is executed and 
takes
             effect when published in the Public Forum.
           Appeals Board's counterargument (summary):  The Payment Order 
was sent
             on March 11 (despite the delay in its delivery), and existed as of
             that time.  Elysion's message of April 11 addressed that 
Payment Order
             (despite Elysion's being unaware of its existence at that 
time, and its
             omission from the parenthetical addendum).

CFJ 1229  "Taral distributed at least one Proposal during the Nomic Week
[FALSE]    beginning May 29, 2000."
Appealed  6/14     Called by Taral
           6/14-17  Assigned to Elysion, who Judges FALSE
           6/17-22  Appealed by Murphy, Taral, and lee
           6/22     Appeal assigned to Wes, lee, and Murphy
           Caller's argument (summary):  E sent it, but its delivery was
             delayed due to a mail server crash.
           Judge's refutation (summary):  Late delivery does not cause
             earlier sending.
           Counterargument:  Earlier sending is just that.  Receipt is a
             separate event.

CFJ 1230  "Taral has not committed any acts of Promotor Misrepresentation."
[TRUE]    6/18     Called by Taral
           6/18-21  Assigned to harvel, who Judges TRUE
           6/22     Taral submits a Motion that Kelly be Ordered to expunge any
                      Blots related to accusations that Taral committed any 
acts
                      of Promotor Misrepresentation
           Judge's argument (summary):  Taral did not believe eir actions were
             a Crime when e performed em, so Rule 1575 applies.

CFJ 1231  "t, acting as Executor of the Zombie Novalis, caused Novalis to
[TRUE]     cast four votes AGAINST Proposal 4018."
           6/19     Called by Steve
           6/20-22  Assigned to Peekee, who Judges TRUE
           Caller's argument (summary):  t clearly attempted to do so.  E had
             previously caused Novalis to come Off Hold.  Did t "made it clear"
             (for the purpose of Rule 1478) that e was acting on Novalis's
             behalf, by stating "Novalis does <action>" and signing it with eir
             own name?
           Judge's response (summary):  Yes, t did make it clear.  E acted as
             if e were Novalis, which is precisely what Rule 1478 allows
             Executors to do.

CFJ 1232  "Taral currently has at least 3 Blots."
[FALSE]   6/22  Called by Taral
           6/22  Assigned to lee, who Judges FALSE
           Commentary:  This was intended to determine whether Kelly's attempts
             to Blot Taral for Promotor Misrepresentation and Promotor 
Tardiness
             were successful.  Taral believes that Blots for a Crime require a
             CFJ (see CFJ 1230).  Kelly believes that e mistakenly named a
             nonexistent Infraction.
           Judge's refutation:  Even if both attempts to Blot were successful,
             Promotor Tardiness carries only a 0.5-Blot penalty; it is 
Tardiness
             (failure to do something ASAP) that carries a 1-Blot penalty.
