Promotor Wes later claimed that 3920 was not assigned to any Proposal,
but this is apparently incorrect because "Streamlining I" is no longer
in the Proposal Queue.


Summary of Adopted Proposals
----------------------------

Proposal 3915 "General Cleanup" by harvel
  Rules 113, 114, and 116 are consolidated into Rule 101.
  Rules 795 and 1600 are consolidated into Rule 754.
  Rule 1692 is consolidated into Rule 1869.
  Rule 1727 has an obsolete reference to the Ambassador removed.

Proposal 3916 "Revised Patent Titles" by harvel
  Maintenance of Patent Titles is transferred from the Registrar to the
    Herald.
  Patent Titles may lose Historical Significance even if they are
    mentioned in the Rules.
  The Patent Titles of Scamster, Quack, Distributor, Robespierre,
    Miscreant, and Maniac are defined.  Rules 840, 1834, 1837, and
    1901, and parts of Rules 1008 and 1670, are deleted.

Proposal 3917 "Fix Group Voting" by Murphy
  Rule 1547 allows other Rules to revoke a Group's permission to Vote.

Proposal 3918 "Fix Failure to Report" by Murphy
  Failure to Report is changed from a Class D Crime (no longer defined)
    to a Class 2 Infraction.  This was done by "A Separation of Money,
    but Not of Powers", then inadvertently undone by "Office
    Normalization".

CFJ 1170  "Players that hold official positions can choose to either
           accept or ignore messages sent to a-d which would require

           the role of their official position"
