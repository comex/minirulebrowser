------------------

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Budgeted Stipends" by Elysion
   The Winner's Stipend is made part of the Treasuror's Budget.

"Fix Rule 408" by Harlequin (on behalf of the Mute Chuck) - Proposal 4077

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Fix Kudos and Remove a Rule" by Elysion
   Kudos are explicitly made non-Property.
   Definition of Shogun is merged into Rule 1923 (Defined Unique Patent 
Titles).

"Fix Rule 1664" by Elysion
   Rule 1664 (Rebellion):
     A Player's Political Status is either Abiding or Rebellious.
     One may change Political Status at most once per month.
     Number of Rebels is determined when the Registrar determines the outcome
       of the Revolt.
     Unique Patent Title of Pugachev goes to the Caller of a failed Revolt.

"Improved Oligarchy" by Steve
   There may be extra Low Oligarchs, temporarily.
   Speakership is merged into a laundry list of other disqualifications.
   Zombies may not bid in Oligarch Auctions.
   Bidder who becomes Speaker or Speaker-Elect has eir bids cancelled.
   All Auction winners start as Low Oligarchs.
   The Grand Warden shall announce an Auction winner taking eir position
     within three days of eir winning bid being paid.
   If a vacancy occurs during an Auction, it shall be filled by a subsequent
     Auction.
   Oligarchs are selected for promotion only when all six positions are full.
   One-choice selections occur automatically.
   Multiple-choice selections are made by majority, or by plurality after
     three days have elapsed.  If three days elapse without a plurality, then
     the Speaker has one week to choose, or else become Tainted; if the
     Speakership changes hands during that week, then the duty transfers and
     the one-week timer starts over.
   If a vacancy occurs during a selection, then the selection is cancelled.

"Tweak Rule 1016" by Elysion
   Rule 1016 (Putting Oneself On Hold) is shortened.  Also, the 96-hour limit
     applies to both going On Hold and going Off Hold.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1243  "Chuck is ineligible to serve as a Justice in the Appeal of CFJ
[TRUE]     1237."
Appealed  8/21     Called by Steve
           8/22-24  Assigned to Wes, who Judges TRUE
           8/25-26  Appealed by Andre, Crito, harvel, Oerjan, and Kelly
           8/25     Andre creates and signs an Application to Submit an
                      Opinion, to force the official recording of eir
                      Dissenting Opinion
           8/25     Crito signs Andre's Application
           8/27     harvel and Steve sign Andre's Application
           8/28     Andre submits and executes eir Application
           8/30     Appeal assigned to Chuck, Taral, and Andre
           9/22     Chuck, Taral, and Andre dismissed from Board; t, Kelly,
                      and Blob assigned to Board
           9/29     Kelly moves to overturn and reverse
           10/6     t and Blob dismissed from Board; Elysion and pTang
                      assigned to Board
           10/6     Elysion proto-moves to overturn and reverse; a verdict of
                      TRUE would indicate that Elysion is ineligible to serve
                      on this Board
           Caller's argument (summary):  Chuck made emself ineligible to Judge
             CFJ 1237 on August 1.  When CFJ was called, Chuck was ineligible
             only due to Rule 1871, which does not affect the Board.  However,
             there may be some Rules that use "Judge" to include Justices too.
           Counterargument (summary):  No, there aren't.  The Rules restrict
             the correctness of Judges and Judgements; they restrict Justices
             only to decide whether the Judge did what e should have.
           Judge's concurring opinion (summary):  The object of "it" in Rule
             911's "when it was called" is "the Appeal".
           Counterargument (summary):  No, the object is "the CFJ".  The time
             that an Appeal is called is undefined anyway, though it would
             presumably be the earliest time at which there exist sufficient
             insistences on Appeal.  Rule 541 iii) and iv) use "the matter
             the Board is to consider" - a phrase similar to one in Rule 911
             - in apparently inconsistent ways, but this is resolved if the
             phrase is interpreted as "the Judicial process regarding a given
             CFJ".  Transferring that interpretation to the context of Rule
             911, the only sensible interpretation of "when a Judicial process
             was called" is "when the original CFJ was called".

CFJ 1247  "t's Order dated Wed, 20 Sep 2000 22:50:26 +0300 was improperly
            executed."
           9/20  Called by Taral
           9/27  Improperly assigned to Wes, who requested ineligibility
           10/6  Assigned to Crito
           Circumstances:  t's first version of "Stable Oligarchy" lacked
             sufficient Power, due to an error in the Ruleset.  t re-submitted
             it with appropriate Power, and ordered (Rulekeepor and Promotor)
             Chuck to make it Distributable.

CFJ 1248  "Rule 1941 shall be interpreted as outlined in pTang's judgement on
            CFJ 1246."
           9/28  Called by pTang
           10/6  Mis-assigned to t, who requested ineligibility
           Caller's argument (summary):  This CFJ is intended to trigger Rule
             789 (Orders to Annotate Rules) and force annotation of Rule 1941.

CFJ 1249  "The paragraph of Rule 1664 which reads
             'The Registar shall select a random integer from 1 to the number
              of Players (plus 1 if Miscreant is held) at the time of the Call
              for Revolt.  If this number is less than or equal to the number
              of Rebellious Players (plus 1 if Miscreant is held by a
              Rebellious Player), then the Revolt succeeds; otherwise it
              fails.'
            should be interpreted such that, while the total number of Players
            is determined as of the time of the Call for Revolt, the number of
            Rebellious Players is determined as of the time the Registrar
            selects a random integer as described.
           10/2  Called by Chuck
           10/6  Assigned to Peekee

CFJ 1250  "Rule 1664 should be interpreted that the effects which are applied
            specifically to Abiding Players or specifically to Rebellious
            Players upon the success or failure of a Call for Revolt, are
            applied based on a Player's status as Abiding or Rebellious at the
            time the Registrar determines whether the Call for Revolt was
            successful or not, and not at the time the Call for Revolt is
            made."
           10/2  Called by Chuck
           10/6  Assigned to Crito

10/2  t states that e causes Novalis to Call for Revolt.  harvel disputes the
         equivalency of this with acting on behalf of Novalis, and also
         disputes that Novalis is deemed to have sent a message to the PF.

10/4  t clarifies that e believed that Players who Rebelled after the Call
         for Revolt was made, but before it was resolved, could still assist
         and benefit.  E offers to have Novalis store other Players'
         Indulgences, in case the Revolt succeeds and Indulgences are taxed;
         as Robespierre, Novalis would be immune to that tax.

10/5  Steve transfers all eir Indulgences to Novalis.

10/1  The Agoran Carnival is updated to stop reflecting the old Transfer
         Orders / Payment Orders system.

       Palnatoke comes Off Hold and makes emself ineligible to Judge anything
         for three weeks.

       Investigating why there are 2098 P-Notes in circulation (rather than a
         round number like 2100), Steve determines that this number has been
         consistent since at least May 1, 2000.

10/2  Elysion is Blotted for Inciting to Riot.

       Zombie Upkeep:
         Crito for Schneidster (paid today)
         Elysion for Harlequin (paid today)
         t for Novalis (paid today)
         Wes for Anthony (unpaid as of 10/7)

       Speaker Chuck announces eir intent to make Proposals 4075 and 4076
         Democratic.  However, since the Quarterly Speaker Transition is in
         progress, Rule 402 (i) makes this announcement without effect.

       Elysion makes emself ineligible to Judge future CFJs till further
       notice.

       In response to Steve's P-Note investigation, Wes states that the MUQ of
         P-Notes changed while e was Promotor, and that e believes two P-Notes
         held by non-Players were destroyed due to rounding.

10/3  Payroll Clerk Taral announces that a Stem Tax is forthcoming.

       In response to Steve's P-Note investigation, t re-posts Promotor Wes's
         P-Note Report of January 31, 2000.  PROSIRUP lost 0.75 P-Notes and
         the Agoran Carnival lost 0.68 P-Notes, but Players gained a total of
         2.36 P-Notes.  Total circulation went from 2098.07 to 2099.  t
         believes that one P-Note was lost while Peekee was Promotor.

       Speaker Chuck announces a Patronage of 30 Stems to pTang for conducting
         Fight Night.  However, since the Quarterly Speaker Transition is in
         progress, Rule 402 (i) makes this announcement without effect.  The
         Stems get transferred before this is realized.

       pTang creates Crony Declarations on the next Elections for these
         Offices:  Justiciar, Notary, Payroll Clerk, Accountor (cost 2 each),
         and Speaker-Elect (cost 4).

       Registrar Michael announces that e is delaying the resolution of the
         Revolt, in hopes that CFJs 1249 and 1250 may be resolved first.

10/5  Registrar Michael reiterates the above.
