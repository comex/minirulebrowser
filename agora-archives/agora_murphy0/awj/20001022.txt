PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Improved Oligarchy" by Steve
   There may be extra Low Oligarchs, temporarily.
   Speakership is merged into a laundry list of other disqualifications.
   Zombies may not bid in Oligarch Auctions.
   Bidder who becomes Speaker or Speaker-Elect has eir bids cancelled.
   All Auction winners start as Low Oligarchs.
   The Grand Warden shall announce an Auction winner taking eir position
     within three days of eir winning bid being paid.
   If a vacancy occurs during an Auction, it shall be filled by a subsequent
     Auction.
   Oligarchs are selected for promotion only when all six positions are full.
   The Grand Warden shall announce the need for selection within three days,
     unless the selection is made before e does so.
   One-choice selections occur automatically.
   Multiple-choice selections are made by majority, or by plurality after three
     days have elapsed.  If three days elapse without a plurality, then the
     Speaker has one week to choose, or else become Tainted; if the Speakership
     changes hands during that week, then the duty transfers and the one-week
     timer starts over.
   If a vacancy occurs during a selection, then the selection is cancelled.

"The Court of Equity" by Taral
   Invalid debts may effectively be disputed and cancelled by CFJ.
   Knowingly and willfully reporting an invalid debt is the Class 10 Crime of
     Extortion.
   Rule 1742 (Agreements between Players) is amended so that the Judge may
     establish debts, rather than directly Ordering Property transfer.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Playing Roles" by Blob
   VTs, P-Notes, IATs, the Accountor and the Priest are repealed.  All units of
     the Currencies are converted to Stems.
   A Player may have at most one Role, and may change from one Role to another
     at most once every three months.  The Registrar tracks Roles.
   Only Politicians may Bid for Voting Entitlements or the Oligarchy.
   Only Scribes may Propose or Bid for Papyri.
   Only Acolytes may Bid for Indulgences.

"Rational Objections" by Blob
   Objections must be accompanied by reasons.

"Tag, You're It!" by Blob
   There is at most one It at any given time.
   If there is no It, then the Speaker shall ASAP select a random Active Player
     who becomes It.
   If a Player is tagged by It within 30 minutes of the Player posting to the
     PF, then the Player becomes It.
   Tagging the Player who tagged you is the Class 1 Infraction of Getting the
     Butcher Back (but is still a valid tag).
