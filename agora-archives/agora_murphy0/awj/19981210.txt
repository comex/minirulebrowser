     THE AGORAN WEEKLY JOURNAL
     VOLUME 44, ISSUE 10
     Thursday edition
     December 10, 1998


PROPOSALS
---------

12/4   Voting on Proposals 3808-3809 has ended.  Proposal 3809 ("Ten Days
         is Too Long") is adopted, changing the Voting Period on Proposals
         from ten days to seven days.  This has a questionable effect on
         the Voting Periods of Proposals 3810-3812, distributed seven days
         and some hours ago.  In CFJ 1110, the Caller's Arguments suggest
         three possibilities:

         1) Seven days after distribution.
            [Timing of a future event may be changed, even to a past time.]
         2) Ten days after distribution.
            [Timing of an event is fixed at distribution, except for e.g.
             a Guillotine Application which explicitly changes it.]
         3) When Proposal 3809 was adopted.
            [Timing of a future event may be changed to a past time, but
             Rule 108 prohibits retroactive alteration of legality of Votes
             cast between then and now.]

       Chuck adds

         4) None.
            [An event does not occur at time X unless, at time X, it is
             defined as occurring at time X.]

12/5   General Chaos Proposes "More Sensible Amendment Numbers".

       Macross Proposes the following text:  "NARF!"  

12/6   General Chaos Proposes "Restore Sanity", "Every Man Is an Island",
         "Unlimited Voting", "Oh, what a tangled web....", "Some
         Housecleaning", and "Down with Playerism!".

       The Repeal-O-Matic Proposes the repeal of Rule 1865 (A Duty to
         Propose).

12/7   General Chaos Proposes "Make the Proposal Queue More Competitive".

       Andre Proposes "Amendment Applications".

12/8   These Proposals are distributed:
         3813 [Crito]         Simplify Currency Handling
         3814 [General Chaos] Currencies
         3815 [Morendil]      Ruleset Lite
