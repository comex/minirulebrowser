CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1138  "Morendil's transfer of one Kudo from Wes to Chuck was
           invalid due to a lack of a valid justification for doing
           so."
          5/28     Called by Wes
          6/15-16  Assigned to Chuck, who makes emself ineligible
          6/21     Assigned to Beefurabi
          Caller's argument (summary):  The statement intended by
            Morendil to be eir justification is demonstrably false.

CFJ 1140  "If no proposals are distributed in a given week, then every
[TRUE]     player has either voted or declared presence on all
           proposals of that distribution."
          6/15     Called by Elysion
          6/21-22  Assigned to harvel, who Judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  The opposite of the second
            clause is "There is a proposal of that distribution on
            which some player has neither voted nor declared presence",
            which is obviously false when the first clause is true.

CFJ 1141  "A Purchase Order may be satisfied by a Transfer Order issued
dismissed  by an Entity other than the Payor named in the Purchase
           Order."
          6/21     Called by Wes
          6/21-22  Assigned to Lee, who dismisses the CFJ

CFJ 1142  "A Payment Order may be satisfied by a Transfer Order issued
[TRUE]     by an Entity other than the Payor named in the Payment Order."
          6/21     Called by Wes
          6/21-24  Assigned to Blob, who Judges TRUE

CFJ 1143? "The Order of the Evil Eye has been dissolved."
          6/20  Called by Murphy
          Caller's argument (summary):  This statement assumes that
            when Crito stepped down as High Priest, e ceased to be
            Vizier; and that Harlequin submitted the Group's ACO.  If
            both are correct, then the statement follows from Rule 721.


OTHER
-----

6/15  Morendil is cited for Inciting to Riot, and becomes Abiding.

6/21  Schneidster registers.

      Chuck comes Off Hold.

6/24  Oerjan makes Schneidster Quiet.

6/25  Vlad deregisters.
