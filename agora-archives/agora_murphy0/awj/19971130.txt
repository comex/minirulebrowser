     THE AGORA WEEKLY JOURNAL
     VOLUME 42, ISSUE 9
     Sunday edition
     November 30, 1997


PROPOSALS
---------

11/23  Murphy protoes "Indefinite Offices", allowing the Speaker to
         declare that a given Office's Term of Service won't expire
         (till it changes hands for some other reason).  This is a
         revival of Blob's old proto "Perpetual Offices".

       Murphy protoes "Make the PVE Permanent", removing the Public
         Voting Experiment's self-repeal clause.

       Murphy protoes a repeal of Rule 1744.

       Murphy protoes "Declaration of Absence", an analogue of
         Declaration of Presence:  Doesn't count toward Quorum, but
         does count as having deliberately responded to the Proposal.

11/24  Proposal 3614 [Crito]    Persistent Style
                                  (Style is not reset quarterly; bonus
                                   only for beating one's old high
                                   Style)
       Proposal 3615 [Swann]    Objects
                                  (Sweeping Currency reform)
       Proposal 3616 [G. Chaos] Nonchallenge of Election Results
                                  (Self-ratification after seven days)
       Proposal 3617 [G. Chaos] No Double Penalties for Officers
                                  (who fail to publish weekly Report)
       Proposal 3618 [G. Chaos] Fix Indulgence Distribution
                                  (Base it on Blots executed minus
                                   Blots vacated)
       Proposal 3619 [G. Chaos] Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank
                                  (Currency transfers to Bank are
                                   reversed unless they state and
                                   accomplish a purpose)
       Proposal 3620 [Steve]    Resignation and Consent
                                  (Resigning Officer's successor does
                                   not take Office till consenting)
       Proposal 3621 [Michael]  Resignation of Offices cleared up
                                  (Resigning Officer's successor must
                                   consent prior to resignation)
       Proposal 3622 [elJefe]   No nonplayer responsibilities
                                  ("role or position to which a Rule
                                   assigns any duties or powers")

       Steve protoes "Judicial Extensions", allowing the Clerk of the
         Courts to grant a one-week extension to Judges.  (If the CotC
         is Judge, then this extension must be granted by the Speaker.)

       InterNomic Proposal 350 fails.

       Swann protoes "Stylish Rules", assigning Style to Rules and
         setting up some mechanisms for changing the Style of Rules.

11/25  Steve re-protoes "Judicial Extensions", making the CotC apply to
         the Justiciar rather than the Speaker for an extension.

       Agora submits InterNomic Proposal 352 (to add Bluesmobile Nomic
         to the list of voting members).

       Swann re-protoes "Stylish Rules", which now assigns new duties
         only to the Wizard (not to the Rulekeepor as well).

       Swann protoes "Risky Quorum", causing one Proposal per week to
         have Quorum of one - but the identity of that Proposal is not
         revealed till the Voting Period ends.

       Swann protoes "Quorum buyback", allowing Players to spend a
         P-Note to reduce a given Proposal's Quorum by one.

       Swann protoes "Quorum without objection", allowing the Speaker
         to declare Without Objection that a Proposal has met Quorum.

11/26  Blob re-protoes "Perpetual Offices".

       InterNomic Proposal 351 (a typo fix to Rule 349) is adopted.
         Agora scores 2 points.

       Swann protoes "Magnetism", a variant of the old Win Tokens.

       Chuck protoes "Repeal Rule Attributions".

11/27  Murphy Proposes "Fix Nominations", clarifying the timing of
         disqualification of Nominees for Office.

       Murphy re-protoes "Declaration of Absence", also repealing the
         ABSTAIN Vote (and a few other fixes).

11/28  elJefe protoes "Late Judgements", allowing the CotC to accept
         same and assign a milder penalty than failing to Judge.

       Proposal 3623 [G. Chaos] Lowered Quorum
                                  (1/3 Active Players or 1/5 Players)

11/30  elJefe protoes "Organizational Payment Orders", authorizing
         Organizations to execute Payment Orders from themselves or
         their members, as authorized by their SLC.

       Proposals 3601-3613 all fail:  the Rule defining Transfer Orders
         is Infected by the Virus, therefore no Voting Tokens could be
         spent to Vote on those Proposals, therefore no Votes counted.
