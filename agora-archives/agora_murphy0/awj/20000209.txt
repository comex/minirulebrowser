ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"CFJ Streamlining" by Wes - Proposal 3962 adopted 1/19
  A CFJ's Deliberation Period explicitly begins with the CotC's
    announcement of a Judge.
  A Player fined for Judging Late becomes ineligible to Judge further
    CFJs, till e requests otherwise in the PF.
  A Player is fined for Judging a Bit Late even if e Judges or dismisses
    the CFJ before the CotC can apply the fine.
  A Judge ceases to be assigned to a CFJ if e becomes ineligible for
    any reason.
  Failing to grant or deny a Motion within a week is grounds for the CotC
    to Recuse and assign a new Judge.
  A Motion for a closed case whose Judge is no longer an Active Player
    is assigned to a new Judge.

     649 (Patent Titles)

  +VTs and -VTs are re-combined into a single Currency.

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

"Assortment of Minor Changes" by harvel - Proposal 3969 rejected 2/3
  Nomic Entities are any non-Player entities declared to exist by the
    Rules, even if they would exist in the absence of that declaration.
  Public Forum announcements sent directly to each Player need not be
    sent to oneself.
  Rule 1688 (Power) is made more terse.

"Fix Holidays" by Murphy - Proposal 3967 rejected 2/3
  Any time period intersecting a Holiday is lengthened by the amount of
    intersection.
  Precedence clauses in Rules 1769 (Holidays) and 1023 (Definition of
    "As Soon As Possible") are clarified.

"Legislative Fix" by Wes - Proposal 3970 rejected 2/7
  Amend Rule 206 (Voting Entities and Votes) to use Legislative Status.
  Amend Rule 1925 (Legislative Status) to assign a Status of Barred to
    Players with at least 15 Blots.

"Stem Conversion Rates" by t - Proposal 3971 rejected 2/7
  Each Basic Currency has an Exchange Rate (adjustable weekly by the
    Payroll Clerk, by up to 10% of the original value) that determines
    how much of that Currency one receives in exchange for a given
    amount of Stems.

"The Oligarchy" by Steve - Proposal 3966 rejected 2/3
  There is one High Oligarch, two Middle, and three Low.
  Oligarchs are disqualified for Speakerhood, non-Playerhood,
    Zombiehood, or Inactivity.
  Only Oligarchs vote on Ordinary Proposals.  Everyone may vote on
    Democratic Proposals.
  Normally, Proposals with AI<2 are Ordinary, and Proposals with AI>=2
    are Democratic.
  Prior to the end of an Ordinary Proposal's Voting Period, the Speaker
    may make it a Democratic Proposal with three Supporters.  All votes
    on it are cancelled.
  Quorum for an Ordinary Proposal is three Oligarchs.
  The High Oligarch casts 3 votes, the Middle cast 2, and the Low cast
    1.  An Oligarch's votes are either all FOR, or all AGAINST; no
    ABSTAIN or Presence.  A Player who becomes an Oligarch during the
    Voting Period does not vote; a Player who changes rank casts votes
    according to the lower rank.
  Positions in the Oligarchy are auctioned with VTs.  The Speaker,
    Speaker-Elect, and current Oligarchs may not bid.  A Player's bids
    are cancelled if e goes On Hold.  A Player assumes a position when
    e pays eir winning bid for that position.
  Vacancies in the High or Middle Oligarchy are generally filled from
    the next lower rank, selected by the third rank.  Vacancies in the
    Low Oligarchy are Auctioned off by the High Oligarch.
  The High Oligarch becomes vacant at the beginning of each month.  The
    Speaker shall conduct an Auction four to ten days in advance.
  Upon a successful Rebellion, all positions in the Oligarchy become
    vacant.

CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1193 "The Payment Orders, designated avt582 through avt593, and
          issued by t in a message dated Thu, 20 Jan 2000 15:51:29
          +0200 (EET), are invalid."
         2/2   Called by Chuck
         2/6   Assigned to Harlequin
         Caller's argument (summary):  TRUE implies Rule 1442/22 can't
           bill for Votes on the Proposal creating it.  FALSE implies
           Rule 1442's requirement to bill is continuous from 1442/21
           to 1442/22, in which case the POs in question are valid.

        uncharged VTs, or not billed at all).

      Palnatoke goes On Hold.

      Steve points out that Proposal 3900 didn't amend Rule 1011 after
