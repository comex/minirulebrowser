ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Harsher Blot Penalties" by Elysion - Proposal 3990 (mislabelled)
    Proposing rights are revoked at 5 (not 10) Blots.
    Voting rights are revoked at 3 (not 15) Blots.
    Nominating for Office is revoked at any number of Blots (not 5 or more).
    Lawlessness occurs after 20 (not 30) Blots.
    The Crime of Persecution is Class 15 (not 20).
    The Crime of Speaker Abandonment is Class 15 (not 20).

"Oligarchy Auctions 'in progress'" by Steve
   Oligarchy Auctions are deemed to be in progress until the positions are
     filled (by way of winning Bids being paid), or one week after all
     winning Bids were billed, whichever is first.  Winning Bids not paid
     within a week are vacated, a 2-Blot penalty is assessed, and a new
     Auction is conducted for that position.

"Please, Be Nice to the Payroll Clerk" by lee
   Repeal Trade Fellowships, which are mistakenly required to be paid
     out of the Payroll Clerk's pocket.  (This is not only undesirable,
     but actually impossible; they're paid in Stems, but Stems can't be
     transferred between Players.)

"Simplify 'ASAP'" by Steve
   Actions required to be done ASAP must be done within a week, or the
     Class 1 Infraction of Tardiness applies.  This period may be
     increased for Inactive Players.

"Streamline Actions With Support" by Steve - Proposal 3991 (mislabelled)
   Actions With Support may be performed as soon as the needed Support is 
given.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Admit, It's a Plutocracy" by t
   Repeal "Sanity".
   An entity has at most five Votes on a Democratic Proposal.
   Players with more than 5 (not 15) Blots cannot Vote on Proposals.
   Repeal "Maximum Votes".
   First Vote on a Proposal is free, additional Votes cost 1 Plutoi each.
   Assessor is Recordkeepor of Plutoi.
   Plutoi are Auctioned for VTs the same way that Indulgences are Auctioned 
for IATs.

"Currency? Points?" by t
   Points are no longer a Currency.

"No Benefits for Slackers or the Undead" by t
   Players do not receive Minimum Income after the beginning of the month
     if they are Zombies at the beginning of the month, or were Inactive
     at least 17 days of the previous month.

"No Honor for the Dishonorable" by t
   Remove Kudos from the Rules.

"No Way" by t
   Repeal "Honorary Players".
   Repeal Rule 1673 (presumably a typo'ed reference to Rule 1676 "Grace Period
     for New Players"), and key "Currency Awards for New Players" to 
registration
     rather than the Grace Period.
   Repeal "Encourage Proposals by New Players".
   Repeal "Installing Officers through Proposal".
   Repeal "Holding an Office in Perpetuity".

"Presence is for Wimps" by t
   Repeal declarations of Presence.

"Violating the Rules" by Steve
   Performing an action prohibited by the Rules, or failing to perform an
     action required by the Rules, is a Class 1 Crime, unless otherwise
     defined as a Crime or Infraction.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1197 "Wes violated Rule 1809 when he failed to stay the Payment Order
[TRUE]    denominated as avt583 when Chuck called the CFJ assigned the number
           1193."
          2/23     Called by Kelly
          2/24-26  Assigned to Anthony, who Judges FALSE
          2/26     Appealed by harvel, lee, and Steve
          2/27     Appeal assigned to Murphy, Blob, and harvel
          2/28     Blob moves to overturn and reassign
          3/2      harvel moves to overturn and reassign
          3/2      Murphy moves to overturn and reassign
          3/9-14   Reassigned to Palnatoke, who Judges TRUE
          3/19     Steve Moves for a Formal Apology
          3/20-22  Motion assigned to Blob, who grants it
          Judge's argument (summary):  Wes was not Clerk of the Courts on
            February 2, when CFJ 1193 was called.  Clerk of the Courts harvel
            may have made two errors:  assigning CFJ 1193 to Harlequin (on
            February 6) without staying avt583, and reassigning CFJ to Peekee
            (on February 14) without confirming a stay on avt583.
          Board's refutation (summary):  Wes *was* Clerk of the Courts (despite
            not being Electee to that Office) on February 2, so Judge Anthony's
            argument is unsound.

CFJ 1201 "The Auction for Middle Oligarchs started on Monday, 06 Mar 2000
[TRUE]    at 23:40:31 -0800 has ended."
          3/15     Called by Blob
          3/16-19  Assigned to Elysion, who Judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  This is FALSE if Wes placed a Bid
            on 3/11, TRUE otherwise.
          Judge's counterargument (summary):  Although Wes did Bid on 3/11,
            no Bid within three days before the calling of this CFJ was the
            highest or second-highest Bid.

CFJ 1203 "The Auction for High Oligarch started on Monday, 06 Mar 2000 at
[TRUE]    23:40:31 -0800 has ended."
Appealed 3/15     Called by Blob
          3/15-17  Assigned to Peekee, who Judges TRUE
          3/18     Appealed by Oerjan, lee, and Blob
          3/18     Appeal assigned to Murphy, Anthony, and harvel
          3/22     harvel moves to overturn and reassign
          Caller's argument (summary):  No winning Bids were made since
            harvel's winning Bid on 3/9, even though harvel retracted that
            Bid on 3/11.  Thus, the auction ended on 3/12.
          Justice harvel's refutation (summary):  Neither of Judge
            Peekee's stated reasons are sufficient to support eir verdict.
          Justice Murphy's refutation (summary):  Judge Peekee points out
            the lack of "hard evidence" to prove that Wes sent eir Bid at
            the time in question.  However, the preponderance of the
            evidence (Rule 1575) indicates that e *did* send eir Bid.
