PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

Author       Title                                  Date(s)
-----------------------------------------------------------
Murphy       Dismissal of a CFJ at the Caller's     9/14, 9/17, 9/18
               Request
Peekee       Ages                                   8/20, 9/18


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1166  "A Currency defined as a Basic Currency by a SLC, but not so
[TRUE]     defined by the Rules, is not a Basic Currency."
          9/11     Called by Murphy
          9/12-16  Assigned to Palnatoke, who Judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  This CFJ is to refute Peekee's
            argument that SLCs may effectively define Basic Currencies
            because defining a Basic Currency places restrictions on
            Players, and Rule 1591 copies that ability to SLCs.

CFJ 1167  "Murphy possesses at least 100 Indulgences."
[FALSE]   9/11     Called by Murphy
          9/12-16  Assigned to Peekee, who Judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1011 no longer prevents
            Players from arbitrarily changing Nomic Properties.

CFJ 1168  "Michael has failed to comply with an agreement that e made
[FALSE]    with Peekee, and so has broken the agreement."
          9/14     Called by Peekee
          9/14-15  Assigned to Wes, who Judges FALSE
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Michael complied with the
            agreement on 9/12.

CFJ 1169  "If a Proposal fails without anyone having voted against it,
           then no one, even the Promotor, receives P-Notes due to the
           effect of Rule 1902 for that Proposal."
          9/16  Called by Chuck
          9/16  Assigned to Annabel
          Caller's argument (summary):  The last paragraph of Rule 1902
            only gives P-Notes to the Promotor when the earlier
            distribution was uneven.  In the case in question, the
            earlier distribution does not occur at all.
