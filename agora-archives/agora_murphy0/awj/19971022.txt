RECENT JUDICIAL ACTIVITY

October 22     CFJ 1014 (previously Dismissed by Chuck)
                        Steve (S), Andre (C), elJefe (J) declare the
                          Dismissal improper
                        reassigned to Michael
               CFJ 1047 Judged TRUE by Vir
                        Appealed by General Chaos, Steve
                        reassigned to Steve (S), Andre (C), elJefe (J)
               CFJ 1051 Blob defaults
                        reassigned to Oerjan
               CFJ 1055 (previously Judged TRUE by Vir)
                        Murphy (pro-S), Crito (pro-C), Zefram (pro-J)
                          overturn/reverse:  final Judgement FALSE
               CFJ 1056 Judged FALSE by Oerjan
               CFJ 1057 Judged FALSE by Oerjan
               CFJ 1059 Judge Blob is deregistered
                        reassigned to elJefe
               CFJ 1060 assigned to General Chaos

CFJ 1014:  "This statement is TRUE."

           Antimatter submitted almost a hundred CFJs with this
           statement.  Chuck's "I dismiss this on the grounds that I
           feel like it." was declared improper; even if Chuck has a
           valid reason for dismissal, e didn't state it.

CFJ 1047:  "General Chaos committed the Crime of Wrongful COE Denial."

           Harlequin attempted to pay VT1040 and VT1041 (for 2 Voting
           Tokens each) by transferring 4 VTs to the Bank.  General
           Chaos declared the attempt unsuccessful, arguing that the
           message could only be one Transfer Order for 4 VTs and not
           two Transfer Orders for 2 VTs each, and denied Harlequin's
           COE contradicting that claim.  The COE turned out to be
           correct, albeit not for the right reason:  Harlequin had no
           VTs at the time in question.

CFJ 1051:  "Elde is Blob's Executor in Probate."

           Shortly before the submission of this CFJ, Morendil was
           Elde's Executor in Probate (and Executor), and Elde was
           Blob's Executor in Probate (and Executor).  At the time of
           the submission of this CFJ, Elde had been deregistered, but
           Blob and Morendil were still registered.

CFJ 1055:  "Some or all of the Payment Orders issued by CotC Andre in a
            message posted on or about Oct. 11, titled 'OFF: Salaries &
            Infractions', were illegally issued, as the number of
            Infractions allegedly committed by Judge Morendil in
            issuing Injunctions in eir Judgement of CFJ 1045 did not
            exceed 4, the number of Injunctions therein issued."

           The truth of this statement would imply that Morendil was
           not Lawless and was thus not deregistered.  The arguments
           against it generally claim that Morendil issued more than 4
           Injunctions; Zefram also notes that CFJ 1055 specifically
           discusses the *alleged* number of Injunctions, which has
           certainly exceeded 4 at times.

CFJ 1056:  "elJefe committed the Infraction of Persistent Indebtedness
            on September 7, September 15, September 22, September 29,
            October 6, and October 13, as a result of Payment Order
            POI018 being overdue on all of these dates."

           Trivially false.  "September 7" should be "September 8".

CFJ 1057:  "elJefe committed the Infraction of Persistent Indebtedness
            on September 15, September 22, September 29 and October 6,
            as a result of Payment Order VT1047 being overdue on all of
            these dates."

           Trivially false.  VT1047 was from the Bank to elJefe, not
           vice versa.

CFJ 1059:  "Rule 1714 should be interpreted such that an allegation of
            Lawlessness sent to the PF must contain an explicit
            declaration that a particular Player is Lawless."

CFJ 1060:  "Ross Morgan-Linial did not successfully transfer a Kudo
            from Harlequin to Blob on October 14."

           Previously discussed in this Journal.  (Ross is Antimatter.)


TERMS OF ABSENCE

* October 14:

Antimatter deregisters emself.  This is successful per Rule 113, even
though Harlequin is Antimatter's Executor, which calls into question
Antimatter's ability to act generally on eir own behalf.

* October 16:

Steve alleges that Calabresi has Abandoned.  This is made interesting
by Rule 1042's quirky terminology:

1) To cause an Absent Player to be deregistered, one must say that
   they are Abandoning (not that they have Abandoned).  So Steve's
   allegation fails to cause Calabresi to become Abandoning and be
   deregistered.

2) Declaring an Absent Player to have Abandoned causes em to be Maybe
   Absent - provided that the Absent Player is also Active.  (This
   clause was intended to refer to Not Absent Players.)

   "Active" used to be a synonym for "not On Hold"; its definition has
   somehow been dropped from the Ruleset, but presumably Game Custom
   preserves the synonymity.  ("Active Player" had better have *some*
   meaning left, as the term is used in eleven Rules.)

Zefram alleges that Vanyel has Abandoned, presumably in a deliberate
attempt to delay Vanyel's deregistration for inactivity.

Neither Calabresi nor Vanyel are On Hold.

* October 17:

Murphy alleges that Calabresi is Abandoning, which triggers Calabresi's
deregistration only if Steve failed to make em Maybe Absent.

Over the next few days, Steve and Zefram have produced several
iterations of competing fixes.  Steve also claims that, if a Player
alleges that they themselves have Abandoned, then that Player is both
Active and Maybe Absent; Murphy tests this by doing it.

* October 20:

Blob becomes Absent.

* October 21:

On Zefram's prompting (and confirmation in eir role as Registrar), Blob
is deregistered for inactivity.


OFFICE POLITICS

* October 17:

Ex-Ambassador Morendil's deregistration caused Speaker Steve to
become temporary Ambassador, so Registrar Zefram initiates an
Election for the Office.

General Chaos is Elected Chancellor by acclamation.

Morendil is Elected Speaker-Elect.  Due to Rules 790, 1006, 1558,
1555, and the precedence relations between them, Morendil assumes
the Office of Speaker-Elect but is immediately removed from it.

Kolja A. Nominates for Ambassador.


OTHER NEWS

* October 14:

The Currencies "Orders", "Payment Orders", and "Transfer Orders"
were destroyed upon the dissolution of the Misanthropists' Group.

* October 21:

General Chaos and Murphy gain the Patent Title of Boor.

Rule 1663 (Win by Proposals) is Infected by the Virus.
