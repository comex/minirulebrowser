CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1093 [Morendil] Judgement:  FALSE
         5/6-11  Assigned to Michael, who Judges FALSE
         "Player Morendil did not commit the Infraction of Inciting to
          Riot."


PROBATE
-------

5/4   Murphy submits a plan for Time Agent.

5/5   Notary Murphy places Jester in Probate.

5/6   Kolja A. objects to Murphy's plan for Time Agent.

      Notary Murphy names Crito as Jester's Trustee.

5/8   Crito submits a plan for Jester, then submits a new one to
        account for Jester's Will.

5/11  Murphy submits a new plan for Time Agent.


OTHER
-----

5/4   Murphy's Score becomes 101.

5/5   Scorekeepor Swann initiates an Endgame Procedure.  If the
        Procedure goes unchallenged for a week, it will terminate; and
        if Murphy has not acquired any Win-Preventing Condition during
        that week, e will Win.

      Morendil and Harlequin have committed the Infraction of Inciting
        to Riot (maybe; see CFJ 1093).  If this is correct, then
        Harlequin becomes Abiding.  (Morendil is already Abiding.)

5/12  Murphy Wins, presumably.

      General Chaos comes Off Hold.
