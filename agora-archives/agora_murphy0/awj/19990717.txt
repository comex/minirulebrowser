CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1143  "The Order of the Evil Eye has been dissolved."
[FALSE]   6/20     Called by Murphy
          7/2      Assigned to Beefurabi, who defaults
          7/9-12   Assigned to Elysion, who Judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  This statement assumes that
            when Crito stepped down as High Priest, e ceased to be
            Vizier; and that Harlequin submitted the Group's ACO.  If
            both are correct, then the statement follows from Rule 721.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  The Group's Ordinances do
            specify the identity of the High Priest, thus the Vizier.

CFJ 1145  "The changes to the scoring Rule announced in message 740 in
[FALSE]    the egroups archive of agora-official are to be used for the
           current round which began June 1, 1999."
          7/2    Called by Lee
          7/2-9  Assigned to Crito, who Judges FALSE
          Judge's refutation (summary):  The announcement occurred less
            than one week before the round in question began, which is
            disallowed by Rule 1875.

CFJ 1146  "Morendil is a Player."
[FALSE]   7/5     Called by harvel
          7/5-10  Assigned to elJefe
          Judge's refutation:  Morendil was deregistered on June 28 for
            Lawlessness, and e has not been Pardoned, so e cannot
            re-register till July 28.
