ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Better Education Means Better Pay" by Atom and/or Sherlock - Proposal 3982
     adopted 3/1
   Each type of Degree has an associated Trade Fellowship, which is added to
     each Office's Salary if the Officer possesses that Degree.

"The Oligarchy" by Steve - Proposal 3980 adopted 2/29
   There is one High Oligarch, two Middle, and three Low.
   Oligarchs are disqualified for Speakerhood, non-Playerhood,
     Zombiehood, or Inactivity.
   Only Oligarchs vote on Ordinary Proposals.  Everyone may vote on
     Democratic Proposals.
   Normally, Proposals with AI<2 are Ordinary, and Proposals with AI>=2
     are Democratic.
   Prior to the end of an Ordinary Proposal's Voting Period, the Speaker
     may make it a Democratic Proposal with three Supporters.  All votes
     on it are cancelled.
   Quorum for an Ordinary Proposal is three Oligarchs.
   The High Oligarch casts 3 votes, the Middle cast 2, and the Low cast
     1.  An Oligarch's votes are either all FOR, or all AGAINST; no
     ABSTAIN or Presence.  A Player who becomes an Oligarch during the
     Voting Period does not vote; a Player who changes rank casts votes
     according to the lower rank.
   Positions in the Oligarchy are auctioned with VTs.  The Speaker,
     Speaker-Elect, and current Oligarchs may not bid.  A Player's bids
     are cancelled if e goes On Hold.  A Player assumes a position when
     e pays eir winning bid for that position.
   Vacancies in the High or Middle Oligarchy are generally filled from
     the next lower rank, selected by the third rank.  Vacancies in the
     Low Oligarchy are Auctioned off by the High Oligarch.
   The High Oligarch becomes vacant at the beginning of each month.  The
     Speaker shall conduct an Auction four to ten days in advance.
   Upon a successful Rebellion, all positions in the Oligarchy become
     vacant.
   [Previous version was Proposal 3966 rejected 2/3]

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Abandoned Proposals Drop Faster" by Wes - Proposal 3983
   Priority of Proposals still in the Queue drops by a minimum of 5 after each
     distribution.

"Be Nice to the Payroll Clerk" by lee
   Repeal Rule 1939, which accidentally requires the Payroll Clerk to pay Trade
     Fellowships out of eir own funds - which e *cannot* do, because 
Fellowships
     are paid in Stems.
   Amend Rule 1893 to not mention Trade Fellowships.

"Harsher Blot Penalties" by Elysion
    Proposing rights are revoked at 5 (not 10) Blots.
    Voting rights are revoked at 3 (not 15) Blots.
    Nominating for Office is revoked at any number of Blots (not 5 or more).
    Lawlessness occurs after 20 (not 30) Blots.
    The Crime of Persecution is Class 15 (not 20).
    The Crime of Speaker Abandonment is Class 15 (not 20).

"More Points" by Wes
   A Player who is Blotted for at least seven days continuously may be 
Penalized
     5 Points.

"Probate fix" by Peekee
   Rule 1601 (Probate) no longer bothers to define "estate" or "terminal".
   Rule 1637 (Wills) replaces "Executor in Probate" with "Notary", and "divide"
     with "assign".
   Rule 1908 (Automatic Dispensation) is tinkered with.
   Rule 1757 (Implementation of Probate Plans) is repealed.

"Quick Minting When It Is Needed" by t
   When no units of a Bank Currency exist, its Mintor may Mint it without the
     usual restrictions

"Secret, Unknown and Hidden Proposals" by Peekee - Proposal 3984
   Secret Proposals may have their Priority increased privately.
   Unknown Proposals may be submitted to the Promotor privately.
   Hidden Proposals are not reported as being in the Queue.
   Each of these increases the Priority Cost by 1.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Currencies" by Kelly
   Transfers and debts are no longer Orders.
   "Limited Executor" is defined.
   Creditors may Order the satisfaction of a debt.  Failure to do so within a
     week of the Order is the 1-Blot Infraction of Persistent Indebtedness,
     which continues to be committed weekly while the debt remains.  Such an
     Order shall be appropriately stayed or vacated upon dispute.
   "Offer of Exchange" is defined.
   Probate is replaced by "dissolute entities", and the Notary is given
     discretion to close out the debts of such entities.
   The Bank is re-unified, and each Currency Recordkeepor is made a Limited
     Executor with power over eir own Currency.

"Important Proposals" by t
   An Interested, non-Insane Proposal may (with 2 Supporters) be made 
Important.
   A Player who can Vote on an Important Proposal, but does not, may be
     penalized 10 Points if e was Active for its entire Voting Period, or went
     On Hold during its Voting Period.  Such Players also commit an Infraction
     if the Proposal fails Quorum.
   Important Proposals cannot be made Disinterested.

"Judicial Reform" by Murphy
   The Judge of a CFJ alleging a previous Judge's non-performance shall not
     Judge it, but shall transfer it to a Board of Appeals instead.
   The CotC shall dismiss unassigned CFJs as explicitly allowed or required by
     the Rules, but this may not be conditional on Statement content.
   Rule 1565 (Dismissal of a CFJ) is clarified.
   Rules 1563 (Statement of a CFJ) and 1756 (Delinquent Judges) are repealed as
     redundant.
   Rule 1868 (Selecting a Judge) is rearranged for clarity.
   Rule 1816 (No Double Jeopardy for Crimes) has "lacks standing" added.

"Kitu" by Wes
   Each Kitu is a Currency possessible only by Players.

"making auctions a little more dangerous" by Sherlock
   Bids may not be retracted, but may be increased.
   Losing Bids must still be paid.

"New Terminology" by Wes
   "Paying a Fee" means transferring Currency for that sole purpose.  Actions
     with an associated Fee must have the Fee paid simultaneously, or within 72
     hours before, or the actions do not occur.
   All "public" communications must be made in the Public Forum.

"Regain Sanity" by Steve
   Only Rules with Power>=2 may overrule Maximum Votes.
   Rule 1723 (Sanity) is given Power=2.

"Streamline 'Actions with N Supporters'"
   Actions requiring Support may be performed immediately after the required
     Support is given.

"Trophies Enters Third Dimension" by t
   Bright shiny entities with no particular effect on gameplay.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1197 "Wes violated Rule 1809 when he failed to stay the Payment Order
Reassign  denominated as avt583 when Chuck called the CFJ assigned the number
           1193."
          2/23     Called by Kelly
          2/24-26  Assigned to Anthony, who Judges FALSE
          2/26     Appealed by harvel, lee, and Steve
          2/27     Appeal assigned to Murphy, Blob, and harvel
          2/28     Blob moves to overturn and reassign
          3/2      harvel moves to overturn and reassign
          3/2      Murphy moves to overturn and reassign
          Judge's argument (summary):  Wes was not Clerk of the Courts on
            February 2, when CFJ 1193 was called.  Clerk of the Courts harvel
            may have made two errors:  assigning CFJ 1193 to Harlequin (on
            February 6) without staying avt583, and reassigning CFJ to Peekee
            (on February 14) without confirming a stay on avt583.
          Editor's note:  Wes *was* Clerk of the Courts (but not its 
Electee) on
            February 2, hence the call for Appeal.

CFJ 1198 "Peekee violated Rule 1809 when he failed to vacate the Payment
[DISMISS]  Order denominate as avt583 when he determined, in the course of
           Judging CFJ 1193, that the Order in question was improperly
           issued."
          2/23     Called by Kelly
          2/25-29  Assigned to Steve, who DISMISSes it:  R1830 and R1565 iv)

CFJ 1199 "The Rules required the Clerk of the Courts to dismiss CFJ 1198."
          2/27     Called by Murphy
          2/27-29  Assigned to Oerjan, who makes emself ineligible
          2/29     Assigned to Crito
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1830 attempts to require CFJ 1198
            to be dismissed.  Rule 1565 prevents the Judge from dismissing it,
            and takes precedence over Rule 1830.  Rule 1830 takes precedence
            over Rule 1868, which attempts to require the CotC to assign it.  A
            precedent for CotC dismissal of CFJs is set by Rule 1562, which 
also
            takes precedence over Rule 1868.
          Counterarguments:  Rule 1565 iv) allows the dismissal of Statements
            that fail to comply with the Rules; Rule 1830 may be interpreted to
            activate that clause.  Rule 1830 does not explicitly specify who
            shall dismiss CFJs alleging Judge non-performance.
