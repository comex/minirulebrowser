     THE AGORAN WEEKLY JOURNAL
     VOLUME 42, ISSUE 11
     Monday edition
     December 15, 1997


PROPOSALS
---------

12/08  InterNomic Proposal 353 [Ackanomic]
         "Amend Rule 215 to replace the word 'Rishonnomic' with the
          word 'Rishonomic.'"
       INP 354 [Thring]
         Add a customized amendment mechanism to Rule 215.
       INP 355 [New Rishonomic]
         Create PlayNomic as a non-voting member of InterNomic.

12/09  Proposal 3633 [Chuck]    Repeal Rule Attributions
       Proposal 3634 [Steve]    Permanent Public Voting
       Proposal 3635 [G. Chaos] Simplify Judicial Salaries
       Proposal 3636 [G. Chaos] Probate, Take Two
       Proposal 3637 [Blob]     Perpetual Offices
       Proposal 3638 [Michael]  Repeal the Virus

       Assessor General Chaos reports that Proposals 3537, 3538, 3543,
         and 3601-3612 - all thought to have failed because the Voting
         mechanism was broken at the time - actually passed, because
         the Voting mechanism wasn't completely broken.  (But 3603
         failed because non-Frankenstein Monsters can't Vote.)

12/09  Harlequin submits an Insane Proposal ("FULL FRONTAL LOBOTOMY")
         with typical "Harlequin Wins when this Rule is created, etc."
         type text.  Harlequin may indeed get a Win by Insanity from
         it, as the combination of the Insanity Rule and the Public
         Voting Experiment appear to forbid any Voting on it.  (But see
         CFJ 1075; the Insanity Rule's ban on discussion may be
         ineffective.  Also, General Chaos disputes the effectiveness
         of the Insanity Rule's "this rule has been bended".)

12/10  General Chaos re-protoes "Lowered Quorum",  "Liberalize
         Speaker's Patronage", and "No Double Penalties for Officers".

       Kolja A. Proposes liberalizing the Repeal-O-Matic Rule.

       Harlequin pays the Petition Fee for "FULL FRONTAL LOBOTOMY",
         making it Interested and thus Insane.

12/11  INP 352 is adopted, making Bluesmobile Nomic a voting member of
         InterNomic.

       elJefe re-protoes "Late Judgements".

       General Chaos protoes "Loophole Avoidance", which would disable
         the Public Voting Experiment whenever it would prohibit all
         Voting on a Proposal.

12/12  Chuck argues that Restore Game Balance II and A Public Voting
         Experiment both created Rules numbered 1741, and protoes a
         pragmatization of Rule 1349.

12/13  Proposal 3639 [Harlequin] Infect Rule 1605
                                   ("Discourages Too Many Proposals")
       Proposal 3640 [Harlequin] FULL FRONTAL LOBOTOMY
       Proposal 3641 [Kolja A.]  <no title>
                                   (Amendment to Repeal-O-Matic Rule)


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1073 [Steve]
         12/08 Assigned to Swann
         "Votes were cast on Proposals 3601-3613."

CFJ 1074 [Michael]
         12/10 Assigned to elJefe
         "A Proposer of a Disinterested Proposal is not liable for a 1
          P-note fee if their proposal fails."

CFJ 1075 [Steve]
         12/12 Assigned to Oerjan
         "Rule 1023 should be interpreted such that no Rule with lower
          precedence than it can succeed in prohibiting activity of a
          purely discussionary nature."


OFFICES
-------

12/09  Michael Nominates for Cartographor.

12/10  Murphy attempts to Nominate for Cartographor, but is not quite
         two hours late.

12/12  Michael is Elected Cartographor by Acclamation.

       No Nominees for Archivist, so another Election begins.

12/14  General Chaos resigns as Assessor.


OTHER
-----

12/14  Oerjan recalculates the Frankenstein Rule's status and finds
         that the restriction of Voting to Frankenstein Monsters was
         never effective after all, meaning that Proposal 3603 passed
         after all.  A sentence requiring Votes to be sent to the
         Frankenstein Monster is added to the Frankenstein Rule (but
         the Public Voting Experiment probably has it covered anyway).


ERRATA
------

Proposals 3537, 3538, 3543, and 3601-3613 actually passed.  [General
  Chaos, Steve]
