      THE AGORAN WEEKLY JOURNAL
      VOLUME 46, ISSUE 22
      July 10, 2000


ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

"Agoran Time" by t - Proposal 4024 failed quorum 7/2
   Agora uses GMT (no daylight savings time).
   Weeks, months, quarters, years, relative times, and periodic
     requirements are defined.

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"72 Hours" by t - Proposal 4026
   Auctions end after 72 (not 24) hours with no new winning Bids.

"Bring Back the Worm!" by Elysion
   "Honourless Worm" is re-enacted, now as a Unique Patent Title
     attaching to the Player (if any) with the least Kudos.

"Excess Baggage II" by Elysion
   A reference to Blots in Rule 1445 (Defaults for Elections) is
     removed, since Players may now Nominate for Office regardless
     of Blots.

"Power!" by t
   All limits on Voting are implemented via Voting Power.  Oligarchs
     have a more severely limited Voting Power on Democratic Proposals.

"The Medici" by harvel
   The Medici is a new Officer who tracks the identity of Officers and
     Oligarchs.  E controls Elections, announces Speaker Transitions, and
     detects Dereliction of Duty.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Cleanup of Dismissals" by Murphy
   A Judgement of DISMISSED may be delivered at any time, but should
     only be delivered for certain reasons.  (If no such reasons apply,
     then such a Judgement should be overturned on Appeal.)
   "Lacks standing" is reserved for CFJs which should be dismissed for
     some reason other than being irrelevant or undecidable.  Such
	    reasons include Excess CFJs, Double Jeopardy CFJs, CFJs alleging
     Judge wrongdoing (one should Appeal instead), and CFJs alleging
     the violation of a private agreement not involving the Caller.

"NEP" by t
   Pennies are a Bank Currency, tracked by the Accountor, and replacing
     Stems, VTs, IATs, and P-Notes.  (Each entity receives Pennies equal
     to half eir combined holdings in these Currencies.)
   Slotten are a Bank Currency, tracked by the Promotor, and paid to
     get Proposals distributed.
   A Proposal's Distribution Cost is 1, or 1.5 if Urgent.
   While Disinterested, a Proposal is always Distributable.
   Interested Proposals start as Undistributable.  Any Player may pay
     a Proposal's Distribution Cost in Slotten to make it Distributable,
     or twice its Distribution Cost in Slotten to make it Undistributable.
   The Current Batch contains all Distributable Proposals.
   The Promotor chooses how many Slotten to Auction each month, but must
     Auction at least one.  If there are at least three Winners other than
     emself, then e may pay out to emself Pennies equal to the Winning Bid.
   New Players get one Slotte, plus one Slotte per Interested Proposal
     adopted during eir Grace Period.
   Each Legislator gets one Slotte when this Proposal is adopted.
   Each Player with more than one Blot gets half eir Blots expunged when
     this Proposal is adopted.

"No Bouncing VEs" by Kelly
   An entity's Voting Power on a Proposal is eir lowest Voting Power
     from the time it was (distributed or made Democratic, whichever
     is later) to the time e attempts to Vote.

"No Sheltering VEs.  And Vacancies Should Be Announced." by Murphy
   Each reason for a vacancy in the Oligarchy is associated with a Player
     who must announce the vacancy ASAP after it occurs.
   If an Oligarch is the Executor of a non-Bank entity possessing VEs,
     then those VEs count toward eir VE holding limit.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

7/4  Steve states that a CFJ ought to be overturned and reassigned when the
        Judge failed to consider an important piece of evidence, or a
        significant line of argument.

      E also states that a CFJ ought to be overturned and reversed when the
        Judge, despite being aware of all relevant facts and Rules, made a
        mistake in interpreting or applying the Rules.

CFJ 1229  "Taral distributed at least one Proposal during the Nomic Week
            beginning May 29, 2000."
           6/14      Called by Taral
           6/14-17   Assigned to Elysion, who Judges FALSE
           6/17-22   Appealed by Murphy, Taral, and lee
           6/22      Appeal assigned to Wes, lee, and Murphy
           6/26      Wes moves to sustain
           6/28      Murphy moves to overturn and reassign
           6/29      lee moves to overturn and reassign
           6/29-7/6  Reassigned to Chuck, who Judges FALSE
           7/6       Appealed by Taral
           Caller's argument (summary):  E sent it, but its delivery was
             delayed due to a mail server crash.
           Judge Elysion's refutation (summary):  Late delivery does not
             cause earlier sending.
           Counterargument:  Earlier sending is just that.  Receipt is a
             separate event.
           Judge Chuck's refutation (summary):  "Distribute" is not
             specifically defined by the Rules, and is generally defined
             as "give out or deliver especially to members of a group",
             which Taral failed to do on June 1.

CFJ 1233  "Rule 1927 should be interpreted as requiring the Executor of the
            Bank to announce eir intent to mint Bank Currencies between seven
            and fourteen days prior to actually minting them.
           7/2  Called by Steve
           7/2  Steve submits a Motion requesting an Order to Annotate
           Caller's argument (summary):  "The Executor of a Bank Currency"
             is strictly undefined, but is a "semanto" (semantic typo) for
             one of "The Executor of the Mintor of a Bank Currency" or "The
             Mintor of a Bank Currency" or "The Executor of the Bank".
           Counterarguments:  The Rules used to define "Executor of a Bank
             Currency" as shorthand for "Executor of the Mintor of a Bank
             Currency".  Thus, "Executor of a Bank Currency" is not a semantic
             typo, but rather an intentional phrase that has since lost its
             meaning.  (Steve says e was unaware of this when e Called the
             CFJ, but now agrees with this counterargument.)  A Bank Currency
             is not an entity, but a set of entities, so it cannot (even in
             theory) have a literal Executor.  It might still be argued that
             "Executor" should be read as "Mintor", or "a Bank Currency" as
             "the Bank".


OFFICES/OLIGARCHS
-----------------

7/2  lee Nominates for Speaker-Elect, but later withdraws.

      Murphy Nominates for Speaker-Elect and Scorekeepor.

      High Oligarch Kelly promotes Elysion to Middle Oligarch, and
        attempts to initiate a Low Oligarch Auction (but fails to

        "Default Procedure for Auctions").

          anyone who acts to benefit Agora; produce Reports for Offices
          defaulting to the Speaker; and make Proposals Democratic if
          and only if someone requests such.  E makes no comment on eir
          judicial policy.

        * If e remains both Treasuror and Payroll Clerk, then e can
          completely satisfy Stem conversion requests in a single
          message.

        * As Treasuror, e would announce Budget amendments in a-d before
          making them, and e would listen to suggestions and incorporate
          them into the Budget.
