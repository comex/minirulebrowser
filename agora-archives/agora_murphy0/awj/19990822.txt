           for Morendil within one week of having received from all
           extant Recordkeepors reports regarding Morendil's holdings
           in the Currencies for which they were respectively

ERRATA
------

Ackanomic CFJ 727 implies that Acka's rules prohibit players of Acka
  from becoming players of Agora, because it would have a material
  effect on the Ackan Gamestate and there is no method in Acka's rules
  for it happening.  Agora ignores this Ackan legal fiction, though.
