ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Billing winning bidders" by Steve
  Winning bids are billed by the Auctioneer, rather than simply becoming owed.

"Fix Rule 1868" by Elysion - Proposal 4092
  The Clerk of the Courts must select and announce a Judge under a single ASAP
    requirement, rather than two separate and successive requirements.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Discretionary Budget" by Elysion
  The Discretionary Budget is part of the Treasuror's Budget, but cannot be
    amended.  The Treasuror may pay out this many Stems monthly, as e sees fit.

"Justiciar Option" by Elysion
  Any CFJ may be filed with the Justiciar rather than the Clerk of the Courts.

"Various Minor Changes" by harvel
  Rule 1728 (Dependent Actions) is cleaned up.
  Rule 514 (Keep the Registrar Notified of Your Address) is cleaned up.
  Rule 1042 (Zombification Due to Silence) is defined by defining "Noiseless"
    (a Player alleged to have abandoned) and "Noisemaker" (the allegator).
  Rule 1755 (No Non-Player Responsibilities) has "paragraph" replaced with
    "forgoing [sic] provisions".
  Rule 1884 (Zombie Masters) is cleaned up.
  Rule 1886 (Returning to Life) is renamed "Vivification Due to Noise", and is
    cleaned up.

CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1251  "Kelly has failed to select a Judge for the CFJ called by Peekee on
           November 11, and Kelly is not the CotC."
          12/15  Called by Elysion

CFJ 1252  "Peekee has a Will."
          11/7  Called by Peekee
          Caller's argument (summary):  Peekee had a Will when Wills last
            ceased to be defined by the Rules.  Now Wills are once again
            defined by the Rules.  Is "Peekee's Will" still an entity?  If so,
            is it once again a Will?

CFJ 1253  "Novalis and Harlequin are not Zombies."
          11/16  Called by Andre
          Caller's argument (summary):  The Zombies have sent messages to the
            Public Forum (e.g. to Vote), which makes them cease to be Zombies.
          Counterargument (summary):  The PF messages are sent by the Zombies'
            Executors, not the Zombies themselves.

CFJ 1254  "Peekee possesses at least one Voting Token."
          11/20  Called by Murphy
          Caller's argument (summary):  Murphy attempted to create a Voting
            Token and transfer it to Peekee.
          Counterargument (summary):  Even if the creation succeeded, the
            Voting Token cannot be possessed or transferred, because the Rules
            do not explicitly define it as being Property.

CFJ 1255  "Rule 1586 should be interpreted such that the Rule created by
           Proposal 4090 (Debt Conversion) has no effect, since any
           outstanding debts and liabilities in Basic Currencies were
           canceled when Basic Currencies were abolished from the Rules."
          12/8  Called by Oerjan
          Counterargument (summary):  Only the Currencies themselves were
            abolished; debts referring to those Currencies continued to exist.


OFFICES/OLIGARCHS
-----------------

12/10  Andre announces that the Referendum to Impeach Kelly as Clerk of the
         Courts passed.  However, when Andre deregistered, the position of Vote
         Collector was transferred to the Speaker.

12/12  No Nominees for Registrar or Grand Warden of the Oligarchy.  New
