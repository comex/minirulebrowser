CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1169  "If a Proposal fails without anyone having voted against it,
[TRUE]     then no one, even the Promotor, receives P-Notes due to the
           effect of Rule 1902 for that Proposal."
          9/16     Called by Chuck
          9/16-19  Assigned to Annabel, who Judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  The last paragraph of Rule 1902
            only gives P-Notes to the Promotor when the earlier
            distribution was uneven.  In the case in question, the
            earlier distribution does not occur at all.

CFJ 1170  "Players that hold official positions can choose to either
           accept or ignore messages sent to a-d which would require
           them to note an action or carry out an action themselves in
           the role of their official position"
          9/25  Called by Peekee
