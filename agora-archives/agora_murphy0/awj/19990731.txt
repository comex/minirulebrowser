CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1147? "It must always be possible to make arbitrary modifications
           to the ruleset by some combination of player actions, even
           if Rule 114 is repealed."
          7/31  Called by Palnatoke
          Caller's argument (summary):  The premise of this statement
            is that "always" implies that Rule 114's requirement would
            survive its repeal.

CFJ 1148? "Midnight of a given day is the midnight at 00:00 hours of
           that day."
          7/31  Called by Palnatoke
          Caller's argument (summary):  The refutation of this
            statement is that midnight of a given day is 24:00 hours of
            that day.

CFJ 1149? "If entity X submits a Transfer Order satisfying a Payment
           Order naming another entity Y as payor, entity Y will commit
           the Crime of Contempt by Inaction if entity Y does not
           submit the Transfer Order specifically required by the
           Payment Order."
          7/31  Called by Elysion
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1569 requires the payor of
            a PO to submit a TO.  If someone other than the payor
            satisfies the PO, the requirement on the payor remains.
