THE CURRENT RULESET
Part 1 of 5 

Rules are listed as follows, where NNN represents the Rule number:

========================================

Rule NNN (Immutable or Mutable)
My Own Unofficial Title

NNN.  Semi-Official Rule Title, If There Is One

      Text of Rule

Annotation: Some Rules are annotated as required by Rule 789.
These annotations "shall guide the interpretation
of that Rule."
Relevant Rules: Such annotations include a list of relevant Rules.

[Note: Some Rules are annotated by me to clarify their interpretation.
Unlike the official annotations, these are enclosed in brackets.
These annotations have no legal force in and of themselves.]

========================================



========================================

Rule 101 (Immutable)
Obey the Rules

101.

      All Players must always abide by all the Rules then in effect,
      in the form in which they are then in effect.  The Rules in the
      Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the first game.
      The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (Immutable) and
      201-219 (Mutable).

========================================

Rule 102 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Rules

102.

      Initially Rules in the 100's are Immutable and Rules in the
      200's are Mutable.  Rules subsequently Enacted or Transmuted
      (that is, changed from Immutable to Mutable or vice versa) may
      be Immutable or Mutable regardless of their Numbers, and Rules
      in the Initial Set may be Transmuted regardless of their Numbers.

========================================

Rule 103 (Immutable)
The Speaker and Voters

103.

      At any time, each Player shall be either a Voter or the Speaker;
      no Player may simultaneously be a Voter and a Speaker. At any
      time, there shall be exactly one Speaker. The term "Player" in
      the Rules shall specifically include both the Voters and the
      Speaker.

========================================

Rule 104 (Immutable)
First Speaker

104.

      The Speaker for the first game shall be Michael Norrish.

========================================

Rule 105 (Immutable)
What Is a Rule Change?

105.

      A Rule Change is any of the following:  (1) the enactment,
      repeal, or amendment of a mutable Rule; or (2) the transmutation
      of an immutable Rule into a mutable Rule or vice versa.
        (Note:  This definition implies that, at least initially, all
      new Rules are Mutable; Immutable Rules, as long as they are
      Immutable, may not be Amended or Repealed; Mutable Rules, as long
      as they are Mutable, may be Amended or Repealed; any Rule of any
      status may be Transmuted; no Rule is absolutely immune to change.)

========================================

Rule 106 (Immutable)
Adopting Proposed Rule Changes

106.

      All Rule Changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on.
      They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required
      number of votes and Quorum is achieved.

========================================

Rule 107 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Must Be Written Down

107.

      Any proposed Rule Change must be written down (or otherwise
      communicated in print media) before it is voted on. If adopted,
      it must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.

========================================

Rule 108 (Immutable)
When May Rule Changes Take Effect?

108.

      No Rule Change may take effect earlier than the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording
      explicitly states otherwise.  No rule change may have retroactive
      application.

========================================

Rule 109 (Immutable)
Rule Numbers

109.

      The Speaker shall give each proposed Rule Change a Number for
      reference.  The numbers shall begin with 301, and each Rule
      Change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next
      successive integer, whether or not the Proposal is adopted.
        If a Rule is Repealed and Reenacted, it receives the Number of
      the Proposal to Reenact it.  If a Rule is Amended or Transmuted,
      it receives the Number of the Proposal to Amend or Transmute it.
 
========================================

Rule 110 (Immutable)
Transmutation of Rules

110.

      Rule Changes that Transmute Immutable Rules into Mutable Rules
      may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among Votes
      legally cast.  Transmutation shall not be implied, but must be
      stated explicitly in a Proposal to take effect.
 
========================================

Rule 111 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Conflicts

111.

      In a conflict between a Mutable and an Immutable Rule, the
      immutable Rule takes precedence and the Mutable Rule shall be
      entirely void.  For the purposes of this Rule a Proposal to
      Transmute an Immutable Rule does not "conflict" with that
      Immutable Rule.
 
========================================

Rule 112 (Immutable)
Winning Must Be by Points

112.

      The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered
      from achieving n points to any other state of affairs.  The
      magnitude of n and the means of earning points may be changed,
      and Rules that establish a Winner when play cannot continue may
      be Enacted and (while they are mutable) be Amended or Repealed.
 
========================================

Rule 113 (Immutable)
Players May Always Forfeit

113.

      A Player always has the option to forfeit the Game rather than
      continue to play or incur a Game penalty.  No penalty worse than
      losing, in the judgment of the Player to incur it, may be
      imposed.

========================================

Rule 114 (Immutable)
At Least One Mutable Rule

114.

      There must always be at least one Mutable Rule.  The adoption of
      Rule Changes must never become completely inpermissible.

========================================

Rule 115 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Which Change Rule-Changing Rules Allowed

115.

      Rule Changes that affect Rules needed to allow or apply
      Rule Changes are as permissible as other Rule Changes.  Even
      Rule Changes that amend or repeal their own authority are
      permissible.  No Rule Change or type of move is impermissible
      solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a
      Rule.

========================================

Rule 116 (Immutable)
Permissibility of the Unprohibited

116.

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
      and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
      which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly or
      implicitly permits it.

========================================

Rule 206 (Mutable)
One Voter, One Vote

206.

      Each Voter has exactly one Vote.  The Speaker may not Vote.

========================================

Rule 208 (Mutable)
End of the Voting Period

208.

      At the end of the prescribed Voting Period on a Proposal, the
      Speaker shall reveal all Votes legally cast on that Proposal. If
      the Speaker's consent may be required for a Proposal to be
      adopted then the Speaker should indicate at that time whether or
      not e gives eir consent.  If the Speaker does not explicitly
      indicate that e refuses to consent to the Proposal, it shall be
      assumed that e consents.

========================================

Rule 212 (Mutable)
Resolving Rule Conflicts

212.

      If two or more Mutable Rules conflict with one another, or if
      two or more Immutable Rules conflict with one another, then the
      Rule with the lowest ordinal Number takes precedence.
        If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of rule) or takes
      precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.
        If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

========================================

Rule 217 (Mutable)
Judgements Must Accord with the Rules

217.

      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however, if
      the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the Statement
      to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider Game Custom and the
      Spirit of the Game before applying other standards.

========================================

Rule 312 (Mutable)
A Point for Voting

312.

      If a Voter votes, he gets one (1) point at the end of the Voting
      Period.

========================================

Rule 376 (Mutable)
When Does a Rule Change Take Effect?

376.  Time that a rule change takes effect:

      An adopted rule change takes full effect at the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it.
      The moment of the completion of the vote is defined by the date
      and time given in the line starting with "Date:" of the Nomic
      listserver message send by the Benevolent Speaker, announcing
      the result of the vote on the corresponding proposal.

========================================

Rule 388 (Mutable)
Game Status When a New Game Begins

388.  Starting a new Game:

      Whenever a new game of Nomic is begun, the status of the new
      Game when it begins shall be the same as the status of the old
      Game when it ended, in all respects where the Rules do not
      decide otherwise.

========================================

Rule 399 (Mutable)
The Office of the Rulekeepor

399.  The Office of the Rulekeepor:

      Let there be an Officer known as the Rulekeepor.
      The Rulekeepor shall maintain a complete list of the current
      Rules, and post this list to all Players at least once a week.
      
      So long as the Rulekeepor is in Office, the Speaker is not
      required to maintain or distribute the Rules.

========================================

Rule 402 (Mutable)
Transfer of Power of the Mighty Speaker

402.  Transfer of Power of the Mighty Speaker:

      When one Mighty Speaker is yielding his Office to another, the
      following procedure shall be followed:
      
       1) The Present Mighty Speaker shall forward copies of all
          necessary materials for the performance of his Office to the
          Prospective Mighty Speaker.
       2) The Prospective Mighty Speaker shall acknowledge the receipt
          of said materials.
       3) The Present Mighty Speaker shall post a message to the
          listserv announcing the official transfer of power, which
          occurs at the "Date:" of the Present Mighty Speaker's
          posting.
      
      The Present Mighty Speaker remains in Office until the successful
      completion of step 3.

========================================

Rule 404 (Mutable)
Legality of Proposals

404.  Legality of Proposals:

      As long as a Proposal satisfies all requirements in place at the
      time of its making for the proper making of Proposals, the act
      of making such a Proposal is legal regardless of its content.
      It is legal to propose a Rule which conflicts with other Rules
      or with itself, which is paradoxical, or which cannot be
      applied.

========================================

Rule 407 (Mutable)
Invoking Judgement

407.  Clerk of the Courts, Part II: Invoking Judgement:

      If Players disagree about the legality of a Move or the
      interpretation or application of a Rule, then a Player may
      invoke Judgement by submitting a Statement for Judgement to the
      Clerk of the Courts.  Disagreement, for the purposes of this
      Rule, may be created by the insistence of any Player.  When
      Judgement is invoked, the Clerk of the Courts must, as soon as
      possible, select a Judge as described in the Rules.  The Clerk
      of the Courts must then distribute the Statement to be judged,
      along with the identity of the Judge, to all Players.

========================================

Rule 408 (Mutable)
Accepting Judge-ship

408.  Clerk of the Courts, Part III: Accepting Judge-ship:

      After the Clerk of the Courts has distributed the Statement to
      be judged and the identity of the Judge, the Judge has one week
      in which to deliver a legal Judgement.  If the Judge fails to
      deliver a Judgement within this time, e is penalized 10 points
      and a new Judge is selected.  A Judgement is delivered by
      submitting that Judgement to the Clerk of the Courts, who must
      then distribute that Judgement to all Players as soon as
      possible.

========================================

Rule 413 (Mutable)
Winning by Paradox

413.  Winning By Paradox:

      If the Rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or
      if the legality of some action cannot be determined with
      finality, or if some action appears equally legal and illegal,
      then a player may Call For Judgement on a Statement to that
      effect.  If the Statement is judged TRUE, then the same Judge
      who judged the Statement TRUE must declare the most recent
      passed Proposal X such that the Statement was not TRUE before
      the passage of Proposal X, or declare that there is no such
      Proposal.  (Until the Judge does this, the Judgment is not
      valid.)  If the Judgement of TRUE is not overruled, then the
      Player who called for Judgement is declared the Winner of the
      game.
      
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared that
      there is no such Proposal X, the game is ended, with no
      provisions for restarting it.
      
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared such
      a Proposal X, the following actions are taken:
         - all Players remain active,
         - all Proposals curently being Voted upon are removed from
           consideration for Voting,
         - the scores for all Players are set to 0 (zero),
         - the Rules and explicit game custom are reverted to the
           state they were in before Proposal X was passed,
         - a Benevolent Speaker for the next Game is chosen:
              -If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the
               Benevolent Speaker, and the old Benevolent Speaker
               becomes a Voter,
              -If there is more than one Winner, the Benevolent
               Speaker randomly selects one of the Winners, who
               becomes the new Benevolent Speaker, and the old
               Benevolent Speaker becomes a Voter,
         - and a new Game is begun.

========================================

Rule 415 (Mutable)
How To Submit a Proposal

415.  "How a Proposal is Submitted":

      A Proposal by a Voter shall be made by submitting it to the
      Mighty Speaker. As soon as possible after receiving the
      Proposal, the Mighty Speaker shall assign the Proposal a Number
      and distribute the Proposal along with its number to all
      Players.
      
      The Mighty Speaker may also make Proposals. The Mighty Speaker
      must process all pending Voter-submitted Proposals first, and
      may then Process Proposals of the Mighty Speaker, assigning
      these Proposals a number and distributing them in the same
      fashion as any other Proposal.

========================================

Rule 417 (Mutable)
The Nomic Archivist

417.  Establishment of the Office of Archivist:

      That there be established an office known as the Nomic
      Archivist, which shall be governed by the default Rules
      concerning official posts. The initial duties of the Nomic
      Archivist shall be to record the passage and failure of
      Proposals, to maintain a "historical record" (defined below)
      of the Ruleset, to maintain a list of Judgements and their case
      histories, and to maintain a list of game Winners in past games.
      The Archivist is free to comment on the historical records as
      they see fit, but such commentary must be clearly delimited
      from the historical material. Where the material being stored
      does not already admit a classification method, the Archivist
      is free to design one themselves.

      The "historical record" of the Ruleset maintained by the
      Archivist is one that includes all rules ever part of the nomic
      Ruleset, annotated with information as to their ultimate fate,
      whether Repealed or Amended etc. This record of the Ruleset has
      no legal force.

      The duties required of the Archivist may be changed with their
      consent and at the request of the Office's controlling body
      (whatsoever that may be). Initially, the controlling body of
      this Office shall be all Players, and any request to change the
      duties must therefore be supported by a majority of Players
      "speaking" to the request.  Naturally, default Rules for
      Offices may establish a different controlling body for this
      Office.
      
      The salary of the Archivist office shall be determined by its
      controlling body. Initially, its salary shall be 5 points and
      one coin of the office-holder's group per week.
      
      The initial office-holder for this post shall be Michael
      Norrish.

========================================

Rule 434 (Mutable)
Game May Be Won By CFJ

434.  Judgement Required to Win (and Timing of Win):

      If a Player believes that he has won the Game, he may submit a
      CFJ to that effect.  If it is returned with the Judgement TRUE
      (and that Judgement is not Appealed), then he has won the Game
      as of the delivery of that Judgement.  If the Judgement is TRUE,
      but is Appealed, but is sustained (and no Proposal to reverse
      the verdict is made), then he has won the Game as of the
      delivery of the Appeal verdict.  If such a verdict is sustained,
      challenged by Proposal, but the Proposal does not pass, he has
      won the Game as of the completion of the Vote on that Proposal.

      Judgement on a CFJ to win the Game may *not* be delivered until
      at least 72 hours after its official announcement, in order to
      give time for the Judge to accept input from the community.

      This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which specifies
      the exact moment at which a Game is won.

[Note: Implicit Game Custom dictates that, despite the title,
this rule does not *require* a CFJ in order to win the game.]

========================================

Rule 450 (Mutable)
Game Entities May Not Be Arbitrarily Changed

450.  Game Entities may not be Arbitrarily Changed:

      Any Entity which is created by the Nomic Rules, and which exists only
      within the context of the current Game of Nomic, such as Points,
      Votes, etc. may *not* be changed by any action other than those
      specified by the Rules.

========================================

Rule 451 (Mutable)
Determination of Judgement--Timing

451.  Timing of CFJ Results:

      When a CFJ makes a Statement about the current state of the
      Game, the result of that CFJ shall be TRUE if and only if the
      Judge feels that that Statement was correct at the time that the
      CFJ was *issued*. Any changes that have happened in the time
      between the issuing of the CFJ and its delivery must be figured
      in to find the correct current state.

========================================

Rule 452 (Mutable)
Prohibition of Electioneering by the Mighty Speaker

452.  Prohibition of Electioneering by the Mighty Speaker:

      The Speaker may not use eis knowledge of the current status of a
      vote on a Proposal in an attempt to influence the result of the
      Vote on that Proposal. Violations of this Rule shall be
      considered a Class C Crime.

========================================

Rule 455 (Mutable)
Penalty for Improper or Lacking Declarations

455.  Further Declaration Rules:

      Any Player who submits a Proposal which does not include a
      Declaration, as described in other legislation, shall be guilty
      of a Class C Crime.  Any Player who submits a Proposal which
      includes a Declaration which has not been approved by
      legislation shall be guilty of a Class A Crime.

========================================

Rule 457 (Mutable)
Voting of the ex-Speaker

457.  Voting of the ex-Speaker:

      If a Player ceases to be the Speaker, and then becomes a Voter,
      that Player may not Vote on any Proposal whose Voting Period
      began while that Player was still the Speaker. This Rule takes
      precedence over any other Rule which indicates who may or may
      not Vote.

========================================

Rule 459 (Mutable)
The Nomic Week

459.  The Nomic Week

      The Nomic Week begins at midnight, GMT, each Monday. Any
      automatic change in the state of the Game which must occur
      weekly occurs at the beginning of the Nomic Week unless
      otherwise stated in the Rules. Any activity which must occur
      at least weekly must occur at least once each Nomic Week.

========================================

Rule 460 (Mutable)
Deregistration of Inactive Players

460.  Deregistration of Inactive Players

      A Player not On Hold who fails to post a message to the
      listserv, cast a Vote, or submit a Proposal or CFJ for 14
      consecutive calendar days is deemed to have left the Game and
      shall be removed from the list of Players. If the former Player
      re-enters the same Game, it shall be with the same score as when
      e left and e shall not be considered a new Player. Otherwise, e
      shall enter on the same terms as a new Player.

========================================

Rule 462 (Mutable)
Yes=For, No=Against

462.  Legislating Custom

      Any Vote of YES shall be treated as a Vote of FOR. Any Vote of
      NO shall be treated as a Vote of AGAINST.

========================================

Rule 463 (Mutable)
Official Specification of Scores

463.  Official Specification of Scores:

      At least once in any seven day period, the designated
      scorekeeper shall send the current scores of all Players to all
      Players, making eir best efforts to determine the correct
      scores. If a Player feels that the posted scores are in error,
      e may make a Call for Judgement, stating what e believes to be
      the correct scores. If the resulting Judgement is TRUE, then the
      scores shall be adjusted to the scores set forth in the Call for
      Judgement, modified further by any score changes which took
      place since the time the Call for Judgement was made. If such a
      Call for Judgement is not made within seven days of the posting
      of the scores, then those scores shall be considered to be the
      accurate and actual scores for the Game.

Rule 468 (Mutable)
Classes of Crimes

468.  Penal system framework

      Penal system framework:
      There shall be several classes of Crimes,
      including Class A, Class B, Class C, and Class D.  Each of these
      aforementioned Classes is more vile than the last, with Class A
      being the least vile and Class D being the most vile.

========================================

Rule 474 (Mutable)
Deregistration and Forfeiture
 
474.  Deregistration and Forfeiture
 
      A player may not be deregistered from the game, except by that
      player (or the Registrar, as specified elsewhere) announcing
      that he forfeits.  When a player forfeits, he remains registered
      for a length of time equal to the longest possible voting period
      on a proposal. At the end of this time, he is deregistered.
 
      During the time between forfeiting and being deregistered, the
      player may not vote or make a proposal.  The player
      automatically refuses any selection for judgement, or any other
      voluntary appointed duties.
 
      If, at any time during this period, the player announces that
      they have changed their mind about forfeiting, then these
      restrictions are instantly revoked, and the deregistration does

      publication unless one of the following conditions then apply:
        - The Judgement which the Injunction accompanies is undergoing
          appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of the appeal
          process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but a proposal
          has been published which would overturn that decision if
          passed, and said proposal has not failed.
        - The validity of the Injunction itself is questioned by a
          pending CFJ.
        - A Judgement upholding the validity of the Injunction is
          undergoing appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of
          the appeal process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but
          a proposal has been published which would overturn that
          decision if passed, and said proposal has not failed.

      A Judgement may not be accompanied by an Injunction unless it is
      specifically permitted elsewhere in the rules. An Injunction
      must be completely consistent with all rules in effect at the
      time of issuance, and must be completely relevant to the matter
      addressed in the corresponding judgement.

      If any Player believes that an Injunction or any part of it does
      not meet the criteria for a valid Injunction, e may submit a CFJ
      to that effect. If the resulting Judgement supports the
      contention that the criteria are not met, the Injunction shall
      be considered illegal and shall have no legal force.

      This rule takes precedence over all rules governing Injunctions.

      the Judgement an Injunction specifying that the move is to be
      retracted, and any resulting adjustments to the published game
      state. The adjustments to the game state must have been
      unambiguously specified within the CFJ, and these adjustments
      must only undo actions which were a direct or indirect result of
      that Move.

      The Winner is the first Voter to achieve sufficiently many
      Points.  The minimum number of Points required for Player X to
      win is 10*N*(1+G/6), where N is the number of Players currently
      registered in the Game, and G is the number of Games which
      Player X has already won.  If more than one Voter achieves this

          Speaker and the old Speaker becomes a Voter.
        - If there is more than one Winner, the Voter with the highest Point 
          total becomes the new Speaker.  If more than one Voter is
          tied for the highest score, the old Speaker randomly selects
          one of them to become the new Speaker.  The old Speaker
          becomes a voter.
        - All Player's scores are reset to 0.

      of two Points) shall be transfered to the Player (or Players)
      who holds Stock X.

      At the passing of this Proposal the Bank has possession of all
      Stocks.  During the following week the Banker shall collect the
      bids in Marks.  Those bids have to be made by the Players
      (either alone or acting together on the same Stock) in a message
      to the server.  No bid shall be made, which can not be covered
      by the Marks in  he bidders Bank account (to be verified by the
      Banker.)

      After one week each of the Stocks shall be transfered from the
      Bank to the highest bidder. If two or more bids for Stock X are
      exactly equal, the Stock shall go to player X (if one of the
      highest bidders), or to the Player with the lowest score.

      If a given Stock X is bought by Player X, the Marks of the bid
      shall be transfered from Player X to the Bank.
      If a given Stock X is bought by another Player (or Players) then
      Player X, the Marks of the bid shall go from this Player(s) to
      Player X.

      The Banker shall keep track of the Stocks held by each Player.

Rule 728 (Mutable)
Destruction of and Compensation for Stocks of Leaving Players

728.  Stocks of leaving Players I

      When Player X leaves the game, Stock X shall be destroyed.
      If Stock X was held at that time by another Player, this Player
      shall be compensated with half the price in Marks that this
      Player paid for the Stock X.
      These Marks shall come from the account of Player X, *before*
      those shall be destroyed, as required by other Rules.
      If there are not enough Marks available, the deficit shall be
      paid by the Bank.
      This Rule applies to the Stock of Players that have left the
      game before adoption of this Proposal.

The Marxist

736.  The Marxist

      Let there be the Patent Title known as "Marxist", which is
      awarded to the Player with the most Marks, or if tied, to the
      Players with the most Marks. Only the current richest Player
      or Players may hold this title.

      The determination and announcement of assignment and revoking
      of the Title is made by the Banker, who must use the most
      accurate means of determining this available to eim, and must
      make the announcement as soon as possible after becoming aware
      of a change in holder of the Title.

      However: To respect some Players' wish for privacy, and in
      view of the secret nature of Marks accounts, a prospective
      Marxist must first be asked if e wants the Title. If not, then
      instead of announcing, "Player x is granted the Patent Title of
      'Marxist', e announces, "Patent Title of 'Marxist' is granted
       to an anonymous Player".

Rule 761 (Mutable)
Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal

761.  Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal: Adjusting for Abstentions

      When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the Votes which
      have been legally cast shall be counted by the Speaker. If a
      Proposal is not Contested, and there are more FOR votes cast
      then AGAINST votes, then that Proposal shall take effect.  If
      such a Proposal has an equal number of FOR and AGAINST Votes,
      then the Speaker shall decide whether the Proposal shall be
      Adopted, or if that Proposal shall fail. If the Proposal is
      Contested, and the number of FOR votes cast is at least twice
      the number of AGAINST votes cast, then that Proposal shall take
      effect.

      If a Rule will change the actions required of or forbidden to
      the Speaker, and the Speaker opposed the Proposal, then that
      Proposal shall be considered Contested. The Speaker shall
      declare if e opposes the Proposal when e distributes the
      Proposal.

      If, for any reason, Player X ceases to be a Member of Group Y,

      Treasury as specified in the Y Ordinances.  If the Y Ordinances
      are silent on this issue, or if Group Y has ceased to exist,

      downwards, shall be transferred to Player X, where N is the
      number of Members of Group Y immediately before Player X ceased
      to be a Member of Group Y.  This transfer is not taxable, and

Rule 764 (Mutable)
Mischief

764.  Mischief

      Any Player or Group X may perform an Act of Mischief directed
      at any Player or Group Y.  The permissible forms of Mischief
      are defined in other Rules; such definitions must include a 
      positive Price in Coins, or the form of Mischief is not
      permissible.  This Rule explicitly takes precedence over all
      other Rules which purport to determine which forms of Mischief
      are permissible.

      To cause an Act of Mischief,  X  sends to the Public Forum a
      message containing:
      - the Name of the object, Y;
      - the effect of the Act of Mischief;
      - the Number of the Rule which permits the form of Mischief;
      - indication of which Coins in X's account will be used as
      payment for the Act of Mischief.  Coins of Group Y, or the
      Group to which Player Y belongs, may not be used as payment.  

      The effect of the Act of Mischief is applied immediately upon 
      publication of the above message in the Forum.  An additional
      effect of this Act of Mischief is that
      - for each Coin of Group Z spent as payment above, two Points
      are removed from the Z Treasury;
      - the Coins used as payment above are removed from X's account
      and destroyed.

Rule 766 (Mutable)
Groups

766.  Amend Rule 714.

      A Group is initially formed by a set of Players which has
      registered with the Registrar to form a Group; other Players may
      join later.  Each Group has a Name, a Membership, a Vizier,
      an Ordinancekeepor, a Treasury, an Initial Set of Ordinances,
      and an associated form of Currency, called the <name> Coins,
      where <name> is the Name of the Group.

      1.  The Name may not be the Name of another Group.

      2.  The Membership is a set of Players;  these Players are
      Members of the Group, and all other Players are not.

      3.  Synchronously with the registration of a Group, two Offices
      are created known as the <name> Vizier, and the <name>
      Ordinancekeepor, where <name> is the Name of the Group.
      These Offices may never be empty, and the <name> Vizier and
      <name> Ordinancekeepor must both be a member of <name> Group.
      The <name> Vizier shall inform the Registrar whenever the
      Membership or the Ordinancekeepor of the <name> group changes.
      When the <name> Vizier changes, the new Vizier shall inform the
      Registrar of the change.
      The <name> Ordinancekeepor shall keep an accurate and current
      record of the Ordinances of the <name> Group.

      4.  The Treasury is a repository for Points and Currencies and
      has the same capabilities for holding, trading, and spending
      Points and Currencies as does a Player.

      5.  The Ordinances are a description of the operation of the
      Group.

      6.  The <name> Coins are a form of Currency which is created
      synchronously with the registration of the Group.  The <name>
      Group may create <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be
      placed in the <name> Treasury.  The <name> Group may destroy
      <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be removed from the
      <name> Treasury.

Rule 767 (Mutable)
Votes for Groups

767.  Amend Rule 646.

      If a Group has N Members then it has N Votes for each
      Proposal in addition to those of its Membership.  The
      Ordinances of a Group may determine how and when the Group
      casts its Votes; if the Ordinances are silent on this issue
      then the Group may not cast its Votes.  The Votes of the
      Group are cast when the Vizier sends a message to the Speaker
      to that effect during the Voting Period and this action is
      legitimate insofar as the Ordinances are concerned.

Sanity

      When a Player submits a Proposal, e may pay one Mark to the Bank
      (if e has at least one Mark) and impose Sanity on that Proposal.
      E must inform both the Banker and the Speaker when doing so.
      A Proposal which has Sanity imposed upon it is known as a Sane
      Proposal.  The Speaker shall, when e distributes a Sane
      Proposal, inform the Players that it is a Sane Proposal.

      No non-Voter Nomic entity may Vote on a Sane Proposal.  Each
      Voter shall have exactly one Vote on a Sane Proposal, and
      each Voter's Vote shall be counted exactly once on a Sane
      Proposal.

      This rule takes precedence over any rule allowing a non-Voter
      Nomic entity to Vote; over any rule which gives any Voter
      more or less than one Vote on a proposal; and over any
      rule which would cause any Voter's Vote to be counted more or
      less than once.

Formal Apologies

      Judgement alleging that a Player (herein called the Ninny) has
      acted or has failed to act in such a way as to be in violation
      of one or more Rules, and this CFJ is Judged TRUE, then the
      Judge must issue an Injunction that the Ninny submit a Formal
      Apology.  This Injunction may also include a list of up to ten
      Prescribed Words.  By a Formal Apology is meant a letter of at
      least 200 words, containing all of the Prescribed Words,
      explaining the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
      for self-improvement, and posted in the Public Forum.  Within 48
      hours of the posting of this Formal Apology, the Squealer must
      either submit a Proposal that the Ninny's Apology be accepted,
      or submit a Proposal that the Ninny's Aplology be rejected,
      but not both.  No other Player may submit such a Proposal, and
      the Squealer may submit only one.  If a Proposal to accept the
      Apology fails, or if a Proposal to reject the Apology passes,
      then the Ninny loses 5 Points.

Rule 785 (Mutable)
Abandonment of Speakerhood

785.  Improve Speaker Succession I

      If the Speaker has abandoned eir post, another new, Temporary
      Speaker is selected according to the "Rules of Succession", or
      if no such rules are defined, the other Player not on hold with
      the highest Score becomes the temporary Speaker.  This does not
      force the Game to be over in this case, and Scores are not reset
      to 0. The Game continues until a Player Wins, at which time a
      new Game is begun and the Winner becomes the real Speaker. The
      Temporary Speaker shall make reasonable effort to obtain the
      former Speaker's materials: proposal queue, voting records, etc.
      but if this is not possible, then the Temporary Speaker shall
      request that these be resubmitted by the Players. If a Speaker
      is replaced in this manner, e has eir score set to minus 2N
      Points immediately, where N is the number of Points required for
      a Player to Win the Game.

      Abandonment is determined as follows: If any Player suspects
      that the Speaker has Abandoned, e sends a message to all Players
      calling on the Speaker to announce eir presence.  The Speaker
      must reply to all Players within one week; if e does not, e is
      considered to have Abandoned.

      Rulekeepor
      Distributor
      <all other Officers in descending Point order>

      When a replacement Speaker is required, all Players who are
      willing to become Speaker shall indicate such in a message, sent
      within three days of the Abandonment or resignation of the
      Speaker.  The old Speaker may not send such a message.  This
      message shall be sent to the Speaker, in the case of a Speaker
      voluntarily giving up his position; or to the first Player who
      called for the Speaker to announce his presence, in the case of
      an Abandoned Speaker.

      After three days, the Player ranking highest on the list

      interpreted in a certain way, e shall also submit a list of
      Rules relevant to that CFJ, which must include the Rule in
      question.  If the statement is Judged TRUE, the Judge may
      include with the Judgement an Injuction requiring the Rulekeepor
      to annotate the Rule in question with the Statement in the CFJ
      and the list of relevant Rules.

      The annotation shall remain only until one of the Rules
      in the list of relevant Rules is amended, repealed, or
      transmuted; or until a CFJ determines that the injunction no
      longer applies, as described below.  While it remains, it shall
      guide the application of that Rule.

      If a Player believes that the circumstances which led to the
      Judgement no longer prevail and the annotation is therefore no
      longer applicable, e may submit a CFJ to that effect. If it is
      Judged TRUE, the annotation shall be stricken from the rule set.

      Proposals in excess of this number. This Rule takes precedence,

      this until at least 24 hours after the Proposal queue was last

      Forum, Players are prohibited from submitting any more
      Proposals, and the Speaker shall refuse to accept any which are
      inadvertently submitted.

      When the number of Proposals up for Vote has dropped to PL/2 or

Rule 848 (Mutable)
Determining When a Rule Has Been Broken

848.  Determining when a Rule has been broken:

      If a Player believes that any Player has not abided by a Rule
      then in effect, in the form in which it was then in effect, then
      the Player may invoke Judgement on a Statement to that effect.
      Similarly, if a Player believes that any Player has commited a
      Crime, e may invoke Judgement on a Statement to that effect.
      Either kind of Statement is known as an Accusation.  A Criminal
      Court is defined as the Judge of an Accusation.
      However,
        -The Accusing player immediately loses 5 points.
        -No Player may be so Accused of actions committed before the
         adoption of this Rule or more than 30 days before the
         Accusation.
        -No Player may be so Accused more than once concerning the
         same committed act, unless the last such Accusation has been
         judged UNDECIDED.
        -The following exception takes precedence over previous Rules 
         concerning Judgement: Neither Accusing nor Accused Player may
         act as Judge for the Accusation; in any case where this would
         occur, a random Voter, neither Accuser nor Accused, shall be
         Judge.
      If the Statement is judged TRUE, the Accused Player has been
      found Guilty of breaking the Rule or committing the Crime, as
      applicable.  If the Statement is judged FALSE, the Accused
      Player has been found Not Guilty of breaking the Rule or
      committing the Crime, as applicable.

      to do, as long as it is legal for em to do so.

      E who defies this has broken this Rule, and shall also be guilty
      of a Class C Crime.

                          IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT

=========================================================================


>From    : Scorekeepor K(o)J'en
To      : Agora Nomic Community
Date    : 04/20/94
Subject : Resignation


Effective immediately, I hereby resign the Office of Scorekeepor, and appoint
Stella as my successor. 

I am honored to have served you for the past few months, but must now spend my
limited Nomic time on other aspects of the Game.

You may wonder why I appointed Stella, because I doubt he wants it. But
unfortunately I've been trying to get volunteers for several weeks, and *no
one* wants it! 

I have no idea what Stella intends to do. He's undoubtably as surprised as all
of you. But I'm sure he will find an amusing way to deal with it.

I fear we are running into a Nomic Accounting Crisis. The Clerk of the Courts
is in a similar situation.

ex- Agora Nomic Scorekeepor

The whole thing is now available via WWW, at http://www.cstp.umkc.edu:8007/dnicol/RULES.html.

That's
http://www.cstp.umkc.edu:8007/dnicol/RULES.html

Rou can select ANY PARTICULAR RULE by appending #rule870, for instance, ont
the end of the URL.  Like, rule 879 can be accessed directly with
http://www.cstp.umkc.edu:8007/dnicol/RULES.html#rule879

Okay?

Anyone got "forms" under control yet, in terms of HTML?  I can see the Virtual

What Utter Nonsense. May I refer you to Rule 754:


Rule 754 (Mutable)
Spelling and Grammar Errors

754.  Spelling and Grammar Errors

      Differences in spelling, grammar, or dialect, or the
      substitution of a word or phrase by a synonym or abbreviation,
      are inconsequential in all forms of Nomic communication, as long
      as there is no ambiguity in meaning. In other words, the meaning
      or validity of such communication is not altered in any way by
      such discrepancies.
      (*Was: 435*)


Now Stella? tell me. Could "Stella" possibly be confused with "KoJen"? With
"Vlad"? With "Garth"? With "Ronald Reagan"? Could it in any reasonable sense be
taken to mean anything other than "Stella?". I don't think so. This "speling
error" does not cause an ambiguity.

Just to be safe, 

        If I am scorekeepor, I hereby resign and appoint Stella? as my
        successor. If I am not, please accept my apologies for wasting 
        everyone's time.

Exactly why I picked you. I expect you'll find something amusing to do with
the Office.

Some protoproposals to stimulate discussion


protoproposal
Official Programming Languages
(creates a rule)

All officially approved programs for automating rule-mandated tasks
shall be written in ANSI C, C++, or the "C Shell".

[Justification: We don't yet have "officially approved programs for
automating rule-mandated tasks", but when we do, we must ensure that
these can be mantained by as many Players as possible. The above are very
widely used programming languages.]


protoproposal
Official Operating System
(creates a rule)

All officially approved programs for automating rule-mandated tasks
shall run under the UNIX operating system, or an essentially similar
clone.

[Justification: We don't yet have "officially approved programs for
automating rule-mandated tasks", but when we do, we must ensure that
these can be used by as many Players as possible. The above is a very
widely used operating system.]

Hello all, 

Three proto-proposals for your commentary and (possibly) abuse,

    1)  Patent Title of Prize Doofus
    2)  Amending Rule 825 to give it legal force
    3)  Amending Rule 856 to give it legal force

Apart from telling me whether you think they're any good as 
proposals, could someone please tell me if I have made some grave 
formatting faux-pas?  Thanks.


======================================================================

proto-Proposal XXX

Patent Title of Prize Doofus
(creates a rule)

Let there be the Patent Title known as Prize Doofus, which shall be
given to such persons who display incredible stupidity, backwardness,
arrogance and ignorance; in the collective opinion of Players of 
eNomic.

This title may be held by Players of eNomic, but is not limited to 
such individuals.

Let the first instance of this Patent Title be awarded to Lawrence
Canter of Canter and Siegel.


======================================================================

proto-Proposal XXX

Amending Rule 825 to give it legal force
(amends a rule)

Let the text of rule 825 be amended to read as follows:

      Proposals may affect the game when the effect/s is based on
      votes or activities before the passage of said Proposal only if
      said Proposal was passed unanimously.

      For the purpose of this Rule, Proposals that are passed without 
      receiving any AGAINST votes are considered to be unanimous.

      This rule takes precedence over Rule 761.

[This proposed amendment simply asserts precedence of this rule over
rule 761.  CFJ 123 determined that 825 was without force because 761
implicitly took precedence.  The proposal rectifies matters.]


======================================================================

proto-Proposal XXX

Amending Rule 856 to give it legal force
(amends a rule)

Let the text of rule 856 be amended to read as follows:

      Any Proposal which introduces a new way to Create or Destroy
      a Conserved Quantity shall require at least three times as
      many FOR Votes as AGAINST Votes in order to pass.  This
      restriction does not apply to Proposals which define new
      Conserved Quantities or Create the initial stock of a new
      Conserved Quantity.

      This rule takes precedence over Rule 761.

[This proposed amendment simply asserts precedence of this rule over
rule 761.  CFJ 128 determined that 856 was without force because 761
implicitly took precedence.  The proposal rectifies matters.]

    ZIBROWSKI         0.00

This means that the Abelian Group has passed the 10*18*(1+0/6) =
180 Points needed to win.

Congratulations Abelian Group!


As I hear some disgruntled mutterings in the background I shall
explain. By 724 "The Winner is the first Voter to achieve sufficiently
many Points.  The minimum number of Points required for Player X to
win is 10*N*(1+G/6), ..."

We see that
1) the first sentence implies that the Winner is a Voter;
2) the second sentence gives only the limit for a *Player* to win.

Ad 1) Can we establish that a Group is a Voter?
In fact there are quite a few rules that *assume* that
the set of Players is identical to the set of Voters plus the Speaker,
but there is no Rule that explicitly says so.
For instance 103 only says "At any time, each Player shall be either a
Voter or the Speaker" which doesn't exclude other Nomic Entities to be
Voter as well.

Game custom doesn't help either. Both Players and Groups have Voted
and thus are Voters, according to the dictionary definition of those
words.

I find:
>1 vote \'vo_-t\ n
> 1: a choice or opinion of a person or body of persons expressed
>    usu. by a ballot, spoken word, or raised hand; also : the
>    ballot, word, or gesture used to express a choice or opinion
> 2: the decision reached by voting
> 3: the right of suffrage
> 4: a group of voters with some common characteristics <the big city
>    vote>
>
>2 vote vb
> 1: to cast a vote
> 2: to choose, endorse, authorize, or defeat by vote
> 3: to express an opinion
> 4: to adjudge by general agreement : DECLARE
> 5: to offer as a suggestion : PROPOSE
> 6: to cause to vote esp. in a given way
> -- voter n

"Voter" is thus a somebody or a something that votes.
Obviously this applies to Groups as Rule 767 gives Groups the Right to vote.

Ad 2) Having established that a Group is a Voter and thus may win, we
have to establish the limit.

[Note that while the second sentence implies that the Speaker has
a limit too, the first implies that e can't win. But I digress.]

Of course, such a limit *must* exist by Rule 112 for any entity that
may win the Game.
However the only limit that is given is that for a Player. It is
the famous 10*N*(1+G/6).

Of course, the only logical thing to do is to conclude that this
limit applies to all sort of winners.

Hence the Abelian group, not having won before, needs 180 Points to win.

Greetings,
the Scorekeepor.

Oerjan gives arguments against my claim that the Abelian Group won
a game.

> [Convincing arguments deleted]

You are very convincing. I stand corrected.
As I feel that the published scores (everybody zero as follows from
the my claim that the Abelian Group won), I will submit a CFJ, as I am
encouraged to do by Rule 463.

This would vastly simplify the construction of proposals, the
interpretation of Rules, and would bring Nomic more in line with real
world politics.

To avoid messing with the precedence of existing proposals, we could
make an exception for existing Rules, which would be "grandfathered"
to use the old precedence Rule:


protoproposal
(amends a rule)

Amend Rule 212 to the following:

If two or more Mutable Rules conflict with one another, or if two or
more Immutable Rules conflict with one another, then the Rule with the
Rule with the highest orginal Number takes precedence.

If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of itself
that it defers to another Rule (or type of rule) or takes precedence
over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such provisions shall
supersede the numerical method for determining precedence.

If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another or
defer to one another, then the numerical method again governs.

Exception: if any of the Rules in conflict have a number less than
892, then the lowest numbered Rule takes precedence.

Not really; just that that person will not be able to take advantage of this
program; e will have to do the work with old-fashioned manual labor. Or e (or
someone else) could provide em with a translation of the program to run on eir

I will take such a poll. Everyone: please send me the following information. I
will summarize in one week.

1: your preferred programming languages

2: other programming languages available to you

3: your preferred operating system

4: other operating systems available to you

5: other information regarding your computing habits and/or platform which you
feel would be relevant to Nomic Automation.

Here are the results for Proposals 893-906.  I apologize for the
delay.

The Proposal Queue is open, and has been for the last week.  There
are NO Proposals in it so far...  What is this, spring fever??  :)

This was an interesting batch of results.  We have our first new
Immutable Rule of the Game!  Should I get a Title for this?

And TWO Proposals passed unanimously, netting their Proposers,
Nicol and Ko-Jen, three Marks apiece.  As if Ko-Jen needed any
more...

                       Speaker Garth

======================

Proposal 893 (Nicol) P
 
Precedence of FPDs
(creates a rule)
 
Newer foreign policy directives take precedence over older ones.
 
A foreign policy directive may be dropped from the records only
after it has explicitly been superceded in another foreign policy 
directive.

[This precedence order creates amendment and repeal of FPDs without
 bringing in new NRC proposal declariations, and also insures that
 there will always be at least one active FPD.]

[ A simple way to keep the Ambassador's life easy, without lots of
new Proposals.  I like it. ]

Other Rule Changes and Proposals
(Creates a Rule)

New kinds of Rule Changes may be defined by the Rules, so long as
they Create, Amend, Repeal, Transmute, or otherwise change one or
more Rules, without making any other direct changes to the Game
State.

All proposed Rule Changes are Proposals.  Other kinds of Proposal
may be defined by the Rules.  They shall be treated as proposed
Rule Changes in all respects, save that they shall not change any
Rule in any way, and they shall not under any circumstances be
incorporated into the Ruleset.  A given class of such Proposals
shall not be valid unless the Rules define which Player or Players
must maintain a current record of that class of Proposals, or
explicitly state that that class need not be recorded.

The first paragraph of this Rule does not apply to Proposals that
are not Rule Changes.

This Rule takes precedence over other Rules describing the nature
of Rule Changes and/or proposed Rule Changes.

[ When Transmuted, this will patch the hole in 105. ]

[ It's mine, but I gotta plug it.  It'll fix a major hole in the
Immutables, plus straighten out NRC Proposals once and for all. ]

add such a reference to the Ruleset shall be considered to have been
improperly submitted, and shall not be Voted upon.

[ Hard references are a real headache, as the Rule referred to may

Default Rules for Adopting Proposals
(Amends a Rule)

Rule 761 is Amended in its entirety to read:

When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the Votes which
have been legally cast shall be counted by the Speaker. If a
Proposal is not Contested, and the ratio of FOR Votes to AGAINST
Votes exceeds the mandated Adoption Ratio for that Proposal, then
that Proposal shall be Adopted.  If the ratio for such a Proposal
exactly equals the required Adoption Ratio, then the Speaker shall
decide whether the Proposal shall be Adopted, or if that Proposal
shall fail.

The Adoption Ratio for all Proposals shall be 1:1, unless otherwise
specified in the Rules.  Unanimity is defined as an Adoption Ratio
of an arbitrarily large number to one.

If a Rule will directly change the actions required of or forbidden
to the Speaker, and the Speaker opposed the Proposal, then that
Proposal shall be considered Contested. The Speaker shall declare
if e opposes the Proposal when e distributes the Proposal.  A
Contested Proposal shall have its Adoption Ratio doubled.

[ Lets Rules define classes of Proposals that require less or more
Votes than a simple majority.  Several existing Rules are languishing
for lack of this. ]

2:1 or unanimous Proposal is Contested? ]

Emergency Marks Tax

If at any point in time the Bank owns zero Marks, the Banker shall
transfer x percent of each Player's or Currency-owing Entity's
(but not the Bank's) Marks account to the Bank, where x shall be
chosen so that the total number of Marks collected exactly covers
all the Bank's debts plus one Mark.  The Bank's debts shall then
be paid, starting with the largest debt and moving to the smallest.

Players who lose Marks in this fashion shall be compensated with 
Points in a ratio of 25 Points to the (lost) Mark.  These Points
shall be drawn from the Point Reserve.  Entities which can own
Points, and which lose Marks in this fashion, shall be similarly
compensated.

Recording Decrees 
(Creates a Rule)

Proposals that are not proposed Rule Changes are known as Decrees.

The Clerk of the Courts shall maintain a current record of all
Decrees to Appeal Judgements.

The Ambassador shall maintain a current record of all Foreign 
Policy Directives.

The Rulekeepor shall maintain a current record of all other Decrees
that have a continuing legal effect.

Decrees to Award Titles or Run for Offices need not be recorded.

The Archivist shall maintain a record of all other Decrees.

This Rule applies to Decrees in general, and defers to the Rules
for specific types of Decrees.

[ This ensures that current records are maintained for NRC
Proposals, now known as Decrees.  Yes, this at least implicitly
assumes that my 105 Patch passes, but can stand on its own. ]

PROPOSAL 901 (Ko-Jen) P
The Office of Scorekeepor
(amends a rule)

The rule which on 4/12/94 was numbered 493, defining the Office of
Scorekeepor, is to be amended by replacing with the following:

There shall exist an Office known as Scorekeepor. The Scorekeepor is
responsible for maintaining a list of the Point Scores of all current
Players and other Game Entities, making such a list available on
request as well as posting it at least once a Week, and for notifying
Players in the event of a Win on Points. E must abide by all Rules
governing Scoring, but in cases where the Rules are unclear or
contradictory is to use eir best judgement in determining Scores.

The Scorekeepor is chiefly a tabulator of Point changes posted by
others. E is only Legally Responsible for tabulating those classes of
Point changes where Rules specifically bestow Legal Responsibility
upon the Scorekeepor.

[ Justification: Define the Scorekeepor's duties, adding requirement
to track non-Player Entities. Assert that e is primarily a tabulator
of Point changes requested by others, not an individual who is
expected to understand and enforce every obscure Rule on Scoring. ]

[ This should go a long way toward making the Scorekeepor job more
doable. ]

work the Office requires; lower than other major Officers. Bring it up
to a competitive level equal to other major Officers. ]

=======================

PROPOSAL 903 (Ko-Jen) P
Point Changes Automatically Applied by the Scorekeepor, Part 1 
(creates a rule)

Classes of Point changes which the Scorekeepor is Legally Responsible
for detecting and tabulating without a specific request by another
Player include, but are not necessarily limited to the following:

* Salaries which consist of a fixed Point award per Week.

* Transfers of Points specifically requested by the owner of the
Points in a message received by the Scorekeepor.

* Transfers of Points from a Group Treasury specifically requested by
the Vizier of that Group in a message received by the Scorekeepor;
however, the Vizier is legally responsible for ensuring that such a
Point transfer is consistent with eir Group's Ordinances.

* Point changes resulting from end of Game adjustments.

* Point rounding, taxation and "Welfare", if mandated by other Rules.

* Point changes resulting from a Player joining or leaving the Game.

* Point changes resulting from dissolution of a Group.

* Point changes resulting from a premature transfer of Speakership.

The Scorekeepor is Legally Responsible for ensuring that the above
Point changes are performed according to all Rules.

Additional classes of Point changes which are the Scorekeepor's Legal
Responsibility may be defined by other Rules.

[ Justification: Rather than amend many existing Rules to state that
the Scorekeepor is legally responsible for detecting these classes of
Point Changes, this single Rule bestows to the Scorekeepor specific
Legal Responsibility for detecting and applying these classes of Point
changes. ]

Point Changes With Legal Responsibility Unspecified
(creates a rule)

If a Rule mandates a change in Points, but no Rules exist which define
the Player Legally Responsible for detecting and reporting the change
to the Scorekeepor, then the Point change is cancelled.

This Rule takes precedence over all other Rules governing changes in
Points, to the extent permitted.

[ Justification: Ensure that in the future, Rules will not be written
which stipulate a Point change but do not specify who is to detect
it. This should make everyone think before proposing: Is this too much
work? Who is going to do it?

Existing Rules are all covered by the specfic instances in the
Proposals "Point Changes Automatically Applied By the Scorekeepor,
Part 1", and "Point Changes Requested By Other Players, Part 1". New
Rules will need to specifically define who is Legally Responsible, or
they are effectively cancelled. ]

PROPOSAL 906 (Ko-Jen) P
Point Changes Requested By Other Players, Part 1
(creates a rule)

The Legal Responsibility for detecting the following classes of Point
changes and reporting them to the Scorekeepor is bestowed upon another
Player:

* All Point changes directly related to the submission of Proposals:
responsibility of Speaker, who must report these no later than the
message announcing the voting results.

* All Point changes directly related to voting on Proposals:
responsibility of Speaker, who must report these no later than the
message announcing the voting results.

* All point changes resulting from Vototron contributions:
responsibility of Speaker, who must report these no later than the
message announcing the voting results.

* All point changes resulting from fees for judgements, salaries and
penalties given to judges: responsibility of Clerk of the Courts, who
must report these as soon as possible, and no later than the message
announcing the outcome of the judgement.

* Electioneer per-position-filled salary: responsibility of
Electioneer to notify Scorekeepor within one Week.

* Point changes regarding the "Squealer/Ninny" Rule: If the Ninny must
lose Points, the responsibility lies with the Squealer for informing
the Scorekeepor as soon as possible.

* Marks interest: responsibility of Banker to nofify Scorekeepor as
soon as possible following the mandated interst payment.

* Proposal lottery: responsibility of Sweepstakes Officer, who must
notify Scorekeepor as soon as possible after the drawing.

* Ambassador salary: responsibility of Ambassador for notifying
Scorekeepor no later than one Week following the time the payment is
earned.

* Stock dividends: responsibility of the Banker for notifying
Scorekeepor no later than one Week following the time the dividends
are earned.

The Scorekeepor notification must be via the public forum or, if
individually subscribable distribution lists are implemented, must be
made on a distribution list which is potentially available to anyone
who wishes to subscribe to it.  This paragraph takes precendence over
other Rules which would require a private Scorekeepor
notification. The notification need not be on a separate message, as
long as the Scorekeepor is mentioned, and the message is on a list
which is received by the Scorekeepor.

Other classes of Point changes whose legal responsibilty for reporting
is other than the Scorekeepor may be defined by other Rules.

[ Justification: Rather than amend many existing Rules to state who is
legally responsible for the many classes of Point changes, this single
Rule does this for several classes of Point Changes. ]

I gained 54 Points from the Scorekeepor Reform Proposals. Per my agreement, I
plan to transfer half these Points, or 27 Points, to the Players who voted FOR
all of these Proposals.

These Players are Nicol, Michael, Ian, and Lance.

I will be transferring 6.75 Points to each of these Players as soon as the
Scorekeepor credits the scores.

I believe that I sent the following message incorrectly.
I shall therfore try again.

It is with great pleasure and utmost joy that I hereby
announce that we have a new Clerk of the Courts!

Congratulations Clerk of the Courts Lance!!!!

He has all of the pertinent records and is merely waiting
to see this message before starting to carry out the duties 
that I have been unable to do for so long.

Thank you Lance, for taking over a duty that I was not
fulfilling and for helping the esteemed Agora Nomic carry
on its fine tradition.

Agora Champion jeffrey s.
Former Clerk of the Courts
