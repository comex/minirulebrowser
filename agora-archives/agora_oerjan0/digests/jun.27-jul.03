No, I don't want people to mess with my Immutable rights.

The question of the differences between Proposed Rule Changes and
Proposals was settled already long ago by Game Custom. The answer is:
they are identical.

Therefore:
I herewith make the Oath that I will vote AGAINST every transmutation
of an Immutable Rule during the next eight weeks, as long as I am allowed
to do so.

That should settle it.

Greetings,
Stella?

   I've been considering this as an interesting twist to the ruleset.  Now
with the proto-proposals to reduce complexity, I think this might be an
interesting alternative.

Proto-Proposal
(Rule sunset act)
Creates a Rule

   All mutable rules must undergo a reauthorization vote every four months.
These votes shall be held like the regular vote on a new Proposal, but
reauthorization votes are not subject to any proposal limitations and shall
happen automatically.  Any rule which fails to be reauthorized, shall be
removed from the ruleset.

Shit.

I've been checking mail two to five times a day, and forwarding manually 
any messages I have received then, using a distribution list.

Unfortunately, I just talked to the sysadmin, who informed me that this 
system's mail server is set up to NOT allow messages with a large number 
of adressees to prevent just this sort of thing.  I mentioned it would 
have been nice if they had sent me a message to this effect...

DO *NOT* USE "coren@suuper.suu.edu" AS THE DISTRIBUTION ADDRESS; IT IS 
*BROKEN*!!!

I am very *very* sorry about the snafu!

I've moved automating this silly list to the top of my priority list 
(like, right after I send this, if I can figure out how); in the 
meantime, under the clause that makes sending messages to the Distributor 
first optional, I suggest that people send official messages DIRECTLY TO 
THE LISTSERV, "nomic@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au", with the string "OFF:" in 
the Subject - that way people will get them immediately.  I still 
recommend against using the old "Oerjan" address, as the Distribution 
list has changed significantly since then.

I have all my copies of the messages that have disappeared during the 
hiatus; I will resend them immediately.

I will also be sending messages to everyone on my list to double check 
that they are sub'd to the Listserv.

Once again, my most sincere apologies.

An annoyed/contrite Coren

Call For Judgement 155

The Judge is    Coren

Caller:         Stella?
Date:           Sat, 25 Jun 94 16:20:27 SET

Barred Players: NONE

Judge:          Coren
Date Assigned:  Sat Jun 25 11:26:53 EDT 1994
Date Judged:    Sun, 26 Jun 1994 09:23:01 -0700 (PDT)


The Judgement:  FALSE

Scorekeepor:    Player Coren received 5 points for Speedy Judgement.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Statement

I'd like to CFJ on the following statement (with thanks to Malcolm
Ryan who pointed at the problem):

"As at present a vote can never be completed,
no further Play is possible"

Arguments to this outrageous statement:

According to Rule 376, Rule changes take effect `at the moment of the
completion of the vote that adopted it.'
The moment of the completion of the vote is defined as given `by
the date and time given in the line starting with "Date:" of the
Nomic listserver message send by the Benevolent Speaker, announcing
the result of the vote on the corresponding proposal.'

And who, I may ask, is this Benevolent Speaker? David Bowen?
No, he is only Speaker, both by Rule 724 (winning the
Game) and Rule 785 (Speaker succession).

We don't have a Benevolent Speaker, who may send out the messages
with the Voting Results. This esteemed person disappeared
when the Rules declaring eim to be one disappeared (back in 1993).

Hence the required message which effectively completes the Vote
can never be send out legallly.

Note: a paradox in a paradox.
By declaring this Statement TRUE, Rule 413 will cause continuation
of Play, as it requires the Judge to cure the problem, after which
the submitter of this CFJ will be instated as....
Benevolent Speaker.

References:
376.  Time that a rule change takes effect:

      An adopted rule change takes full effect at the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it.
      The moment of the completion of the vote is defined by the date
      and time given in the line starting with "Date:" of the Nomic
      listserver message send by the Benevolent Speaker, announcing
      the result of the vote on the corresponding proposal.
724.  Requirements for Winning

      The Winner is the first Voter to achieve sufficiently many
      Points.  The minimum number of Points required for Player X to
      win is 10*N*(1+G/6), where N is the number of Players currently
      registered in the Game, and G is the number of Games which
      Player X has already won.  If more than one Voter achieves this
      condition simultaneously, then all such Voters win.  When a Game
      ends in this manner:
        - If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the new
          Speaker and the old Speaker becomes a Voter.
        - If there is more than one Winner, the Voter with the highest Point
          total becomes the new Speaker.  If more than one Voter is
          tied for the highest score, the old Speaker randomly selects
          one of them to become the new Speaker.  The old Speaker
          becomes a voter.
        - All Player's scores are reset to 0.
        - A new Game is begun.  All Rules and Proposals retain the
          status they had at the end of the old Game.
785.  Improve Speaker Succession I

      If the Speaker has abandoned eir post, another new, Temporary
      Speaker is selected according to the "Rules of Succession", or
      if no such rules are defined, the other Player not on hold with
      the highest Score becomes the temporary Speaker.  This does not
      force the Game to be over in this case, and Scores are not reset
      to 0. The Game continues until a Player Wins, at which time a
      new Game is begun and the Winner becomes the real Speaker. The
      Temporary Speaker shall make reasonable effort to obtain the
      former Speaker's materials: proposal queue, voting records, etc.
      but if this is not possible, then the Temporary Speaker shall
      request that these be resubmitted by the Players. If a Speaker
      is replaced in this manner, e has eir score set to minus 2N
      Points immediately, where N is the number of Points required for
      a Player to Win the Game.

      Abandonment is determined as follows: If any Player suspects
      that the Speaker has Abandoned, e sends a message to all Players
      calling on the Speaker to announce eir presence.  The Speaker
      must reply to all Players within one week; if e does not, e is
      considered to have Abandoned.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Judgement:

This statement is FALSE.

As there is no rule (at present) which defines a *separate* office known 
as the Benevolent Speaker, nor any rule defining any specific effect that 
the use of an adjective has in conjunction with an official Title, the 
use of the term "Benevolent Speaker" must be considered synonomous with 
the only officially defined term relevant in this case, that of "Speaker".
The substitution of this synonomous phrase does not appear to be in any 
way ambiguous either under the current ruleset, nor in common usage 
within Agora Nomic.

Therefore, under Rule 754, this substitution is "...inconsequential in all
forms of Nomic communication..." 

Reference:

Rule 754 (Mutable)
Spelling and Grammar Errors

754.  Spelling and Grammar Errors

      Differences in spelling, grammar, or dialect, or the
      substitution of a word or phrase by a synonym or abbreviation
      are inconsequential in all forms of Nomic communication, as long
      as there is no ambiguity in meaning. In other words, the meaning 
      or validity of such communication is not altered in any way by
      such discrepancies.

-----------------

The Statement

I'd like to CFJ on the following statement (with thanks to Malcolm
Ryan who pointed at the problem):

"As at present it is not possible to submit Proposals and have them
distributed, no further Play is possible"

Arguments to this outrageous statement:

The way that Proposals shall be made and distributed *seems* to be
nicely gouverned by Rule 415: " A Proposal by a Voter shall be made
by submitting it to the Mighty Speaker".

I ask you: who *is* this Mighty Speaker?  David Bowen?
No, he is only Speaker, both by Rule 724 (winning the
Game) and Rule 785 (Speaker succession).

We don't have a Mighty Speaker. This esteemed person disappeared
when the Rules declaring eim to be one disappeared (back in 1993).

Hence we have no Mighty Speaker and Proposal submission is
*legally* impossible.

References:
415.  "How a Proposal is Submitted":

      A Proposal by a Voter shall be made by submitting it to the
      Mighty Speaker. As soon as possible after receiving the
      Proposal, the Mighty Speaker shall assign the Proposal a Number
      and distribute the Proposal along with its number to all
      Players.

      The Mighty Speaker may also make Proposals. The Mighty Speaker
      must process all pending Voter-submitted Proposals first, and
      may then Process Proposals of the Mighty Speaker, assigning
      these Proposals a number and distributing them in the same
      fashion as any other Proposal.
724.  Requirements for Winning

      The Winner is the first Voter to achieve sufficiently many
      Points.  The minimum number of Points required for Player X to
      win is 10*N*(1+G/6), where N is the number of Players currently
      registered in the Game, and G is the number of Games which
      Player X has already won.  If more than one Voter achieves this
      condition simultaneously, then all such Voters win.  When a Game
      ends in this manner:
        - If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the new
          Speaker and the old Speaker becomes a Voter.
        - If there is more than one Winner, the Voter with the highest Point
          total becomes the new Speaker.  If more than one Voter is
          tied for the highest score, the old Speaker randomly selects
          one of them to become the new Speaker.  The old Speaker
          becomes a voter.
        - All Player's scores are reset to 0.
        - A new Game is begun.  All Rules and Proposals retain the
          status they had at the end of the old Game.
785.  Improve Speaker Succession I

      If the Speaker has abandoned eir post, another new, Temporary
      Speaker is selected according to the "Rules of Succession", or
      if no such rules are defined, the other Player not on hold with
      the highest Score becomes the temporary Speaker.  This does not
      force the Game to be over in this case, and Scores are not reset
      to 0. The Game continues until a Player Wins, at which time a
      new Game is begun and the Winner becomes the real Speaker. The
      Temporary Speaker shall make reasonable effort to obtain the
      former Speaker's materials: proposal queue, voting records, etc.
      but if this is not possible, then the Temporary Speaker shall
      request that these be resubmitted by the Players. If a Speaker
      is replaced in this manner, e has eir score set to minus 2N
      Points immediately, where N is the number of Points required for
      a Player to Win the Game.

      Abandonment is determined as follows: If any Player suspects
      that the Speaker has Abandoned, e sends a message to all Players
      calling on the Speaker to announce eir presence.  The Speaker
      must reply to all Players within one week; if e does not, e is
      considered to have Abandoned.

------------------------------

The Judgement:

I accept nomination and judge "Balderdash".

Reason: "Mighty Speaker" == "Speaker", by Rule 754.

-- KoJen

P.S. Also by Rule 754, "Balderdash" == "False".

Call For Judgement 156

The Judge is    Dave Bowen

Caller:         Stella?
Date:           Mon, 27 Jun 94 19:16:57 SET

Barred Players: Coren, Garth

Judge:          Dave Bowen
Date Assigned:  Mon Jun 27 15:38:09 EDT 1994
Date Judged:    

The Judgement:  

Scorekeepor:    

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Statement

I would like to submit the following statement for Judgment:

"The weekly Lottery for the week starting May 23 was not held
by its responsable Officer.
This was an illegal Move and should be corrected by making the
following adjustments:
- the lottery shall be held by the Officer responsable and the
result shall by published;
- the score of the Player who's Proposal won the lottery shall
increase by 15 Points (one point per proposal entry)."

Players barred: Coren, Garth

Note that (by 665) the Judge may include an Injunction.

Arguments:
The then Speaker, Garth, distributed Proposals 918-932 on May 27.
However, the weekly Lottery, that according to Rule 749 should have
taken place, was never held.
This oversight was clearly an Illegal Move and its effects (15 Points
less for a Player as yet unknown) should be corrected.
According to 665 the adjustments necessary are included in the statement.

References:

665.  Specific Injunctions, part I

      If a CFJ alleges that a specific Move is illegal, and the
      Judgement supports the allegation, the Judge may include with
      the Judgement an Injunction specifying that the move is to be
      retracted, and any resulting adjustments to the published game
      state. The adjustments to the game state must have been
      unambiguously specified within the CFJ, and these adjustments
      must only undo actions which were a direct or indirect result of
      that Move.


749.  Weekly Lottery Correction

      Every time a Voter proposes a Proposal, that Voter shall gain
      one Entry into a weekly Lottery. Each week, a random Entry shall
      be selected by the designated Sweepstakes Officer, and the Voter
      who owns that Entry shall receive 1 Point per Entry by any other
      Player into the Lottery. For purposes of this Rule, a week
      shall begin on Monday at 12:00 am and shall last seven days,
      until Sunday at 11:59 pm, in the time zone in which the
      designated Sweepstakes Officer resides. The weekly drawing
      shall take place as soon as possible after the end of the week.

The Statement

I would like to submit the following statement for Judgment:

"The Sweepstake Officer shall hold all weekly Lotteries, that should
have taken place according to the Rules, but weren't held."

Players barred: Coren, Garth

Note that (by 665) the Judge may include an Injunction.

Arguments:

According to Rule 749 any Proposal gains its Proposer an entry into
a weekly Lottery.
The corresponding weekly drawing shall be take place `as soon as
possible' after the end of the week.

The proposal lottery for the week of May 23, in which 15 Proposals
were distributed on May 27, has as yet not taken place.
Garth, the responsible Officer was apparently not able to do it
(assuming he obeyed the Rules!).

Hence the new Sweepstake Officer is still under the same obligation
as the old one: the let this Lottery take place `as sson as possible'

(Send via yoyo, as that is the faster medium)
Score report 24 June-29 June 1994
=================================

-Two players added, bringing us to 23.  A record?
Why did people vote against the Proposal to eliminate Players that seem
eternally On Hold? Eric, Zibrowski...
Greed?

-KoJen's Mark interest was reported as 1 Point. This must be wrong
and I changed it back to 21. By the way KoJen is in the lead with
96 Points, 63 of which game from Mark Interests.

-Stock Dividend is calculated by Yours Truly on the Stocks which
were already sold by last Friday. (See list below).

-Alice complained that she did vote on the Proposals too.
Dave Bowen says that these Votes were not in the Records he got
from Garth. But as she, nor anybody else, CFJ'ed on this, I leave it
as is. It's easy to change later, if the question is decided.

-As usual, please point out errors, oversights, wishfull thinking and
other Freudian mistakes.

Greetings,
Scorekeepor

Call For Judgement 158

The Judge is        Coren

Caller:             KoJen
Date:               Wed, 29 Jun 94 08:56:39 -0400

Barred Players:     Stella?

Judge:              Coren
Date Assigned:      Wed Jun 29 13:45:31 EDT 1994

The Judgement:  

Scorekeepor:    

Notes from the Caller:
    I wish to bar Stella? from judging. I wish to advise the Judge
    that, should this be judged True, an injunction is required. This
    injunction should include any necessary adjustments to the Scores,
    and a requirement for a formal apology by the Scorekeepor.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Statement

Scorekeepor Stella? violated Rules for Scorekeeping when he took it upon
himself to second-guess the accurate report by the Banker of KoJen's Marks
Interest. 

Arguments:

Banker Bowen reported the following for 6/27/94:

>        KoJen          +  1

Scorekeepor Stella? said:

> -KoJen's Mark interest was reported as 1 Point. This must be wrong
> and I changed it back to 21. By the way KoJen is in the lead with
> 96 Points, 63 of which game from Mark Interests.

Very generous of Stella?, but he is not allowed to do that, by the following
Rules: 

>From 901:

      The Scorekeepor is chiefly a tabulator of Point changes posted
      by others. E is only Legally Responsible for tabulating those
      classes of Point changes where Rules specifically bestow Legal
      Responsibility upon the Scorekeepor.

>From 906:

      The Legal Responsibility for detecting the following classes of
      Point changes and reporting them to the Scorekeepor is bestowed
      upon another Player:

      * Marks interest: responsibility of Banker to nofify Scorekeepor
      as soon as possible following the mandated interst payment.

Call For Judgement 157

The Judge is    Chuck

Caller:         Stella?
Date:           Mon, 27 Jun 94 19:17:33 SET  

Barred Players: Coren, Garth

Judge:          Chuck
Date Assigned:  Mon Jun 27 15:40:47 EDT 1994
Date Judged:    Wed, 29 Jun 94 03:27:49 CST  

The Judgement:  UNDECIDED

Scorekeepor:    Player Chuck receives 5 points for Speedy Judgement

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Statement

I would like to submit the following statement for Judgment:

"The Sweepstake Officer shall hold all weekly Lotteries, that should
have taken place according to the Rules, but weren't held."

Players barred: Coren, Garth

Note that (by 665) the Judge may include an Injunction.

Arguments:

According to Rule 749 any Proposal gains its Proposer an entry into
a weekly Lottery.
The corresponding weekly drawing shall be take place `as soon as
possible' after the end of the week.

The proposal lottery for the week of May 23, in which 15 Proposals
were distributed on May 27, has as yet not taken place.
Garth, the responsible Officer was apparently not able to do it
(assuming he obeyed the Rules!).

Hence the new Sweepstake Officer is still under the same obligation
as the old one: the let this Lottery take place `as sson as possible'

References:
749.  Weekly Lottery Correction

      Every time a Voter proposes a Proposal, that Voter shall gain
      one Entry into a weekly Lottery. Each week, a random Entry shall
      be selected by the designated Sweepstakes Officer, and the Voter
      who owns that Entry shall receive 1 Point per Entry by any other
      Player into the Lottery. For purposes of this Rule, a week
      shall begin on Monday at 12:00 am and shall last seven days,
      until Sunday at 11:59 pm, in the time zone in which the
      designated Sweepstakes Officer resides. The weekly drawing
      shall take place as soon as possible after the end of the week.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Judgement:

I Judge UNDECIDED.

This is YACDBPW (yet another CFJ doomed by poor wording).  While I
agree that the Sweepstakes Officer is required to hold the Sweepstakes
for weeks past that have not yet been held, this is not *quite* what
the CFJ alleges.

I recall a fairly lengthy discussion in Nomic World on the meaning
of the word "should."  The only consensus that was reached is that
"should" is a very ambiguous word and *should* not be used. :)

Thus, where the CFJ says,

"The Sweepstake Officer shall hold all weekly Lotteries, that should
have taken place according to the Rules, but weren't held."

I must use my own judgement in interpreting the "should" in the
statement.  I interpret this CFJ as, "The Sweepstake Officer
shall hold all weekly Lotteries, which according to the Rules were
required to be held *by now*, but weren't held."  The "by now" in
my interpretation is of utmost importance, as we shall see.  If the
meaning was not "required to be held by now" but "required to be held,
at any time" then (IMO) the CFJ would have read "...that should take
place according to the rules..."

Were there any lotteries that were required to be held by now, but were not?
Stella? himself provides the answer.  The lotteries are required to
be held "as soon as possible," yet, as Stella? points out, Garth
was presumably unable to carry out his duty.  Thus, no Rule has (yet)
been violated, and the Rules do not require any of the missing lotteries
to have been held by this time.

So when the CFJ says "...all weekly Lotteries, that should have taken
place according to the Rules..." there are no such Lotteries.  The
CFJ is based on a false premise, and I must judge UNDECIDED.
(Analogous to the question "Do you still beat your wife?")

(I would recommend that Stella? submit a similar CFJ with clearer wording.)

Chuck

Congratulations to Agora for having lasted an entire 365 days; and
congratulations to those of us still in the game after all that time. 

Let's hope Agora continues for many more years to come, in some shape
or form. 

Michael.

Score report 24 June-30 June 1994 (corrected and updated)
=========================================================

-I am sorry, I am sorry, I am sorry:
Dave was correct: KoJen has only one Point Mark interest.
Which means that we have another Marxist, already since the
day the transfer was made.

-Also corrected the day and time that Jeffrey became active.

   The Speaker decides that Proposal 920, which was listed as having an
equal number of FOR and AGAINST votes in the voting summary, shall be defeated.

About Proposals 916 and 917, I quote from ex-Speaker Garth's letter included
with the initial distribution of Proposals 918-932.

>The Proposals 1081 and 1082 were wrongly Numbered;  they are properly 916
>and 917.  The Voting on them was highly irregular, and the outcome unclear;
>I apologize for this and take full responsibility for my actions.

   Sorry for the delay in getting this out.  I was away from the office

Call For Judgement 159

The Judge is    Chuck

Caller:         Stella?
Date:           Thu, 30 Jun 94 19:56:23 SET  

Barred Players: NONE

Judge:          Chuck
Date Assigned:  Thu Jun 30 14:08:34 EDT 1994

The Judgement:  

Scorekeepor:    

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Statement:

I would like to submit the following statement for Judgment:

"The weekly Lottery for the week starting May 23 was not held
by its responsable Officer.
This was an illegal Move and shall be corrected by making the
following adjustments:
- the lottery shall be held by the Officer responsable and the
result shall by published;
- the score of the Player who's Proposal won the lottery shall
increase by 15 Points (one point per proposal entry)."

Players barred: Coren, Garth

Note that (by 665) the Judge may include an Injunction.

Arguments:
The then Speaker, Garth, distributed Proposals 918-932 on May 27.
However, the weekly Lottery, that according to Rule 749 should have
taken place, was never held.
This oversight was clearly an Illegal Move and its effects (15 Points
less for a Player as yet unknown) should be corrected.
According to 665 the adjustments necessary are included in the statement.

References:

665.  Specific Injunctions, part I

      If a CFJ alleges that a specific Move is illegal, and the
      Judgement supports the allegation, the Judge may include with
      the Judgement an Injunction specifying that the move is to be
      retracted, and any resulting adjustments to the published game
      state. The adjustments to the game state must have been
      unambiguously specified within the CFJ, and these adjustments
      must only undo actions which were a direct or indirect result of
      that Move.


749.  Weekly Lottery Correction

      Every time a Voter proposes a Proposal, that Voter shall gain
      one Entry into a weekly Lottery. Each week, a random Entry shall
      be selected by the designated Sweepstakes Officer, and the Voter
      who owns that Entry shall receive 1 Point per Entry by any other
      Player into the Lottery. For purposes of this Rule, a week
      shall begin on Monday at 12:00 am and shall last seven days,
      until Sunday at 11:59 pm, in the time zone in which the
      designated Sweepstakes Officer resides. The weekly drawing
      shall take place as soon as possible after the end of the week.

THE CURRENT RULESET
Part 1 of 6 

Rules are listed as follows, where NNN represents the Rule number:

========================================

Rule NNN (Immutable or Mutable)
My Own Unofficial Title

NNN.  Semi-Official Rule Title, If There Is One

      Text of Rule

Annotation: Some Rules are annotated as required by Rule 789.
These annotations "shall guide the interpretation
of that Rule."
Relevant Rules: Such annotations include a list of relevant Rules.

[Note: Some Rules are annotated by me to clarify their interpretation.
Unlike the official annotations, these are enclosed in brackets.
These annotations have no legal force in and of themselves.]

========================================



========================================

Rule 101 (Immutable)
Obey the Rules

101.

      All Players must always abide by all the Rules then in effect,
      in the form in which they are then in effect.  The Rules in the
      Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the first game.
      The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (Immutable) and
      201-219 (Mutable).

========================================

Rule 102 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Rules

102.

      Initially Rules in the 100's are Immutable and Rules in the
      200's are Mutable.  Rules subsequently Enacted or Transmuted
      (that is, changed from Immutable to Mutable or vice versa) may
      be Immutable or Mutable regardless of their Numbers, and Rules
      in the Initial Set may be Transmuted regardless of their Numbers.

========================================

Rule 103 (Immutable)
The Speaker and Voters

103.

      At any time, each Player shall be either a Voter or the Speaker;
      no Player may simultaneously be a Voter and a Speaker. At any
      time, there shall be exactly one Speaker. The term "Player" in
      the Rules shall specifically include both the Voters and the
      Speaker.

========================================

Rule 104 (Immutable)
First Speaker

104.

      The Speaker for the first game shall be Michael Norrish.

========================================

Rule 105 (Immutable)
What Is a Rule Change?

105.

      A Rule Change is any of the following:  (1) the enactment,
      repeal, or amendment of a mutable Rule; or (2) the transmutation
      of an immutable Rule into a mutable Rule or vice versa.
        (Note:  This definition implies that, at least initially, all
      new Rules are Mutable; Immutable Rules, as long as they are
      Immutable, may not be Amended or Repealed; Mutable Rules, as long
      as they are Mutable, may be Amended or Repealed; any Rule of any
      status may be Transmuted; no Rule is absolutely immune to change.)

========================================

Rule 106 (Immutable)
Adopting Proposed Rule Changes

106.

      All Rule Changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on.
      They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required
      number of votes and Quorum is achieved.

========================================

Rule 107 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Must Be Written Down

107.

      Any proposed Rule Change must be written down (or otherwise
      communicated in print media) before it is voted on. If adopted,
      it must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.

========================================

Rule 108 (Immutable)
When May Rule Changes Take Effect?

108.

      No Rule Change may take effect earlier than the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording
      explicitly states otherwise.  No rule change may have retroactive
      application.

========================================

Rule 109 (Immutable)
Rule Numbers

109.

      The Speaker shall give each proposed Rule Change a Number for
      reference.  The numbers shall begin with 301, and each Rule
      Change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next
      successive integer, whether or not the Proposal is adopted.
        If a Rule is Repealed and Reenacted, it receives the Number of
      the Proposal to Reenact it.  If a Rule is Amended or Transmuted,
      it receives the Number of the Proposal to Amend or Transmute it.
 
========================================

Rule 110 (Immutable)
Transmutation of Rules

110.

      Rule Changes that Transmute Immutable Rules into Mutable Rules
      may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among Votes
      legally cast.  Transmutation shall not be implied, but must be
      stated explicitly in a Proposal to take effect.
 
========================================

Rule 111 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Conflicts

111.

      In a conflict between a Mutable and an Immutable Rule, the
      immutable Rule takes precedence and the Mutable Rule shall be
      entirely void.  For the purposes of this Rule a Proposal to
      Transmute an Immutable Rule does not "conflict" with that
      Immutable Rule.

========================================

Rule 112 (Immutable)
Winning Must Be by Points

112.

      The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered
      from achieving n points to any other state of affairs.  The
      magnitude of n and the means of earning points may be changed,
      and Rules that establish a Winner when play cannot continue may
      be Enacted and (while they are mutable) be Amended or Repealed.
 
========================================

Rule 113 (Immutable)
Players May Always Forfeit

113.

      A Player always has the option to forfeit the Game rather than
      continue to play or incur a Game penalty.  No penalty worse than
      losing, in the judgment of the Player to incur it, may be
      imposed.

========================================

Rule 114 (Immutable)
At Least One Mutable Rule

114.

      There must always be at least one Mutable Rule.  The adoption of
      Rule Changes must never become completely inpermissible.

========================================

Rule 115 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Which Change Rule-Changing Rules Allowed

115.

      Rule Changes that affect Rules needed to allow or apply
      Rule Changes are as permissible as other Rule Changes.  Even
      Rule Changes that amend or repeal their own authority are
      permissible.  No Rule Change or type of move is impermissible
      solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a
      Rule.

========================================

Rule 116 (Immutable)
Permissibility of the Unprohibited

116.

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
      and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
      which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly or
      implicitly permits it.

========================================

Rule 206 (Mutable)
One Voter, One Vote

206.

      Each Voter has exactly one Vote.  The Speaker may not Vote.

========================================

Rule 208 (Mutable)
End of the Voting Period

208.

      At the end of the prescribed Voting Period on a Proposal, the
      Speaker shall reveal all Votes legally cast on that Proposal. If
      the Speaker's consent may be required for a Proposal to be
      adopted then the Speaker should indicate at that time whether or
      not e gives eir consent.  If the Speaker does not explicitly
      indicate that e refuses to consent to the Proposal, it shall be
      assumed that e consents.

========================================

Rule 212 (Mutable)
Resolving Rule Conflicts

212.

      If two or more Mutable Rules conflict with one another, or if
      two or more Immutable Rules conflict with one another, then the
      Rule with the lowest ordinal Number takes precedence.
        If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of rule) or takes
      precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.
        If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

========================================

Rule 217 (Mutable)
Judgements Must Accord with the Rules

217.

      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however, if
      the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the Statement
      to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider Game Custom and the
      Spirit of the Game before applying other standards.

========================================

Rule 312 (Mutable)
A Point for Voting

312.

      If a Voter votes, he gets one (1) point at the end of the Voting
      Period.

========================================

Rule 376 (Mutable)
When Does a Rule Change Take Effect?

376.  Time that a rule change takes effect:

      An adopted rule change takes full effect at the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it.
      The moment of the completion of the vote is defined by the date
      and time given in the line starting with "Date:" of the Nomic
      listserver message send by the Benevolent Speaker, announcing
      the result of the vote on the corresponding proposal.

========================================

Rule 388 (Mutable)
Game Status When a New Game Begins

388.  Starting a new Game:

      Whenever a new game of Nomic is begun, the status of the new
      Game when it begins shall be the same as the status of the old
      Game when it ended, in all respects where the Rules do not
      decide otherwise.

========================================

Rule 399 (Mutable)
The Office of the Rulekeepor

399.  The Office of the Rulekeepor:

      Let there be an Officer known as the Rulekeepor.
      The Rulekeepor shall maintain a complete list of the current
      Rules, and post this list to all Players at least once a week.
      
      So long as the Rulekeepor is in Office, the Speaker is not
      required to maintain or distribute the Rules.

========================================

Rule 402 (Mutable)
Transfer of Power of the Mighty Speaker

402.  Transfer of Power of the Mighty Speaker:

      When one Mighty Speaker is yielding his Office to another, the
      following procedure shall be followed:

       1) The Present Mighty Speaker shall forward copies of all
          necessary materials for the performance of his Office to the
          Prospective Mighty Speaker.
       2) The Prospective Mighty Speaker shall acknowledge the receipt
          of said materials.
       3) The Present Mighty Speaker shall post a message to the
          listserv announcing the official transfer of power, which
          occurs at the "Date:" of the Present Mighty Speaker's
          posting.
      
      The Present Mighty Speaker remains in Office until the successful
      completion of step 3.

========================================

Rule 404 (Mutable)
Legality of Proposals

404.  Legality of Proposals:

      As long as a Proposal satisfies all requirements in place at the
      time of its making for the proper making of Proposals, the act
      of making such a Proposal is legal regardless of its content.
      It is legal to propose a Rule which conflicts with other Rules
      or with itself, which is paradoxical, or which cannot be
      applied.

========================================

Rule 407 (Mutable)
Invoking Judgement

407.  Clerk of the Courts, Part II: Invoking Judgement:

      If Players disagree about the legality of a Move or the
      interpretation or application of a Rule, then a Player may
      invoke Judgement by submitting a Statement for Judgement to the
      Clerk of the Courts.  Disagreement, for the purposes of this
      Rule, may be created by the insistence of any Player.  When
      Judgement is invoked, the Clerk of the Courts must, as soon as
      possible, select a Judge as described in the Rules.  The Clerk
      of the Courts must then distribute the Statement to be judged,
      along with the identity of the Judge, to all Players.

========================================

Rule 408 (Mutable)
Accepting Judge-ship

408.  Clerk of the Courts, Part III: Accepting Judge-ship:

      After the Clerk of the Courts has distributed the Statement to
      be judged and the identity of the Judge, the Judge has one week
      in which to deliver a legal Judgement.  If the Judge fails to
      deliver a Judgement within this time, e is penalized 10 points
      and a new Judge is selected.  A Judgement is delivered by
      submitting that Judgement to the Clerk of the Courts, who must
      then distribute that Judgement to all Players as soon as
      possible.

========================================

Rule 413 (Mutable)
Winning by Paradox

413.  Winning By Paradox:

      If the Rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or
      if the legality of some action cannot be determined with
      finality, or if some action appears equally legal and illegal,
      then a player may Call For Judgement on a Statement to that
      effect.  If the Statement is judged TRUE, then the same Judge
      who judged the Statement TRUE must declare the most recent
      passed Proposal X such that the Statement was not TRUE before
      the passage of Proposal X, or declare that there is no such
      Proposal.  (Until the Judge does this, the Judgment is not
      valid.)  If the Judgement of TRUE is not overruled, then the
      Player who called for Judgement is declared the Winner of the
      game.

      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared that
      there is no such Proposal X, the game is ended, with no
      provisions for restarting it.
      
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared such
      a Proposal X, the following actions are taken:
         - all Players remain active,
         - all Proposals curently being Voted upon are removed from
           consideration for Voting,
         - the scores for all Players are set to 0 (zero),
         - the Rules and explicit game custom are reverted to the
           state they were in before Proposal X was passed,
         - a Benevolent Speaker for the next Game is chosen:
              -If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the
               Benevolent Speaker, and the old Benevolent Speaker
               becomes a Voter,
              -If there is more than one Winner, the Benevolent
               Speaker randomly selects one of the Winners, who
               becomes the new Benevolent Speaker, and the old
               Benevolent Speaker becomes a Voter,
         - and a new Game is begun.

========================================

Rule 415 (Mutable)
How To Submit a Proposal

415.  "How a Proposal is Submitted":

      A Proposal by a Voter shall be made by submitting it to the
      Mighty Speaker. As soon as possible after receiving the
      Proposal, the Mighty Speaker shall assign the Proposal a Number
      and distribute the Proposal along with its number to all
      Players.
      
      The Mighty Speaker may also make Proposals. The Mighty Speaker
      must process all pending Voter-submitted Proposals first, and
      may then Process Proposals of the Mighty Speaker, assigning
      these Proposals a number and distributing them in the same
      fashion as any other Proposal.

========================================

Rule 417 (Mutable)
The Nomic Archivist

417.  Establishment of the Office of Archivist:

      That there be established an office known as the Nomic
      Archivist, which shall be governed by the default Rules
      concerning official posts. The initial duties of the Nomic
      Archivist shall be to record the passage and failure of
      Proposals, to maintain a "historical record" (defined below)
      of the Ruleset, to maintain a list of Judgements and their case
      histories, and to maintain a list of game Winners in past games.
      The Archivist is free to comment on the historical records as
      they see fit, but such commentary must be clearly delimited
      from the historical material. Where the material being stored
      does not already admit a classification method, the Archivist
      is free to design one themselves.

      The "historical record" of the Ruleset maintained by the
      Archivist is one that includes all rules ever part of the nomic
      Ruleset, annotated with information as to their ultimate fate,
      whether Repealed or Amended etc. This record of the Ruleset has
      no legal force.

      The duties required of the Archivist may be changed with their
      consent and at the request of the Office's controlling body
      (whatsoever that may be). Initially, the controlling body of
      this Office shall be all Players, and any request to change the
      duties must therefore be supported by a majority of Players
      "speaking" to the request.  Naturally, default Rules for
      Offices may establish a different controlling body for this
      Office.
      
      The salary of the Archivist office shall be determined by its
      controlling body. Initially, its salary shall be 5 points and
      one coin of the office-holder's group per week.

      The initial office-holder for this post shall be Michael
      Norrish.

========================================

Rule 434 (Mutable)
Game May Be Won By CFJ

434.  Judgement Required to Win (and Timing of Win):

      If a Player believes that he has won the Game, he may submit a
      CFJ to that effect.  If it is returned with the Judgement TRUE
      (and that Judgement is not Appealed), then he has won the Game
      as of the delivery of that Judgement.  If the Judgement is TRUE,
      but is Appealed, but is sustained (and no Proposal to reverse
      the verdict is made), then he has won the Game as of the
      delivery of the Appeal verdict.  If such a verdict is sustained,
      challenged by Proposal, but the Proposal does not pass, he has
      won the Game as of the completion of the Vote on that Proposal.

      Judgement on a CFJ to win the Game may *not* be delivered until
      at least 72 hours after its official announcement, in order to
      give time for the Judge to accept input from the community.

      This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which specifies
      the exact moment at which a Game is won.

[Note: Implicit Game Custom dictates that, despite the title,
this rule does not *require* a CFJ in order to win the game.]

========================================

Rule 450 (Mutable)
Game Entities May Not Be Arbitrarily Changed

450.  Game Entities may not be Arbitrarily Changed:

      Any Entity which is created by the Nomic Rules, and which exists only
      within the context of the current Game of Nomic, such as Points,
      Votes, etc. may *not* be changed by any action other than those
      specified by the Rules.

========================================

Rule 451 (Mutable)
Determination of Judgement--Timing

451.  Timing of CFJ Results:

      When a CFJ makes a Statement about the current state of the
      Game, the result of that CFJ shall be TRUE if and only if the
      Judge feels that that Statement was correct at the time that the
      CFJ was *issued*. Any changes that have happened in the time
      between the issuing of the CFJ and its delivery must be figured
      in to find the correct current state.

========================================

Rule 452 (Mutable)
Prohibition of Electioneering by the Mighty Speaker

452.  Prohibition of Electioneering by the Mighty Speaker:

      The Speaker may not use eis knowledge of the current status of a
      vote on a Proposal in an attempt to influence the result of the
      Vote on that Proposal. Violations of this Rule shall be
      considered a Class C Crime.

========================================

Rule 455 (Mutable)
Penalty for Improper or Lacking Declarations

455.  Further Declaration Rules:

      Any Player who submits a Proposal which does not include a
      Declaration, as described in other legislation, shall be guilty
      of a Class C Crime.  Any Player who submits a Proposal which
      includes a Declaration which has not been approved by
      legislation shall be guilty of a Class A Crime.

========================================

Rule 457 (Mutable)
Voting of the ex-Speaker

457.  Voting of the ex-Speaker:

      If a Player ceases to be the Speaker, and then becomes a Voter,
      that Player may not Vote on any Proposal whose Voting Period
      began while that Player was still the Speaker. This Rule takes
      precedence over any other Rule which indicates who may or may
      not Vote.

Rule 474 (Mutable)
Deregistration and Forfeiture
 
474.  Deregistration and Forfeiture
 
      A player may not be deregistered from the game, except by that
      player (or the Registrar, as specified elsewhere) announcing
      that he forfeits.  When a player forfeits, he remains registered
      for a length of time equal to the longest possible voting period
      on a proposal. At the end of this time, he is deregistered.
 
      During the time between forfeiting and being deregistered, the
      player may not vote or make a proposal.  The player
      automatically refuses any selection for judgement, or any other
      voluntary appointed duties.
 
      If, at any time during this period, the player announces that
      they have changed their mind about forfeiting, then these
      restrictions are instantly revoked, and the deregistration does
      not take place.

      records, the officer must comply as soon as he reasonably can.

      crime.

      Amended to read:

      A Proposal may contain one or more Rule Changes. If the Proposal

610.  Default Rules for Currencies I: What is a Currency?

      Marks and Coins are Currencies.  Each type of Coin is a separate
      Currency.  Other rules may define other Currencies, but nothing
      is a Currency unless explicitly defined as such by a rule.

========================================

Rule 611 (Mutable)

611.  Default Rules for Currencies II: Who May Own How Many Currencies

      entity may own Currencies except as provided for in the Rules.
      The number of each type of Currency owned by each player or
      other Nomic entity must be non-negative, and must be an integer.

      This rule applies to Currencies in general, and thus defers to
      rules for specific Currencies.

========================================

Rule 612 (Mutable)
Default Rules for Currencies III: Recordkeepors for Currencies

612.  Default Rules for Currencies III: Recordkeepors for Currencies

      required to keep an accurate record of the number of that

      is permitted to own that Currency.

      the Group corresponding to that type of Coin.

      Other rules may establish Recordkeepors for other Currencies.

========================================

Rule 613 (Mutable)

613.  Default Rules for Currencies IV: Default Recordkeepors

      If a Currency exists and no rule (other than this one) exists
      which specifies a Recordkeepor for that Currency, then the
      Banker shall be the Recordkeepor for that Currency.

      This rule applies to Currencies in general, and thus defers to
      rules for specific Currencies.

========================================

Rule 614 (Mutable)
Default Rules for Currencies V: Transferring Currencies

614.  Default Rules for Currencies V: Transferring Currencies

      A player may voluntarily transfer any Currency to any other
      player for any purpose by sending such a message to the
      Recordkeepor for that Currency, within the following limits:

            a) a player may only transfer a positive number of
               a Currency
            b) a player may not transfer more of a Currency than e
               currently has.

      This rule applies to Currencies in general, and thus defers to
      rules for specific Currencies.

========================================

Rule 627 (Mutable)

627.  Initial Capital for the Bank

      Upon passage of this Rule 20 Marks will be created as

exactly when it was, I believe it was in October 1993.]

Garth is now a member of PROSIRUP.  Also, I inadvertently left Garth

actually a carryover from when Oerjan was Registrar.  I actually

THE CURRENT RULESET
Part 3 of 6 

========================================

Rule 628 (Mutable)
The Point Reserve: An Infinite Source and Sink for Points

628.  The Point Reserve

      Let there be a quantity of Points known as the Point Reserve.

      Any action which causes Points to be taken from any Entity, but
      does not specify where these Points are to be given, shall give
      these Points to the Point Reserve.

      The Scorekeepor shall keep score of the number of Points in
      the Point Reserve.
      On adoption of this Rule, the Point Reserve will contain 100
      Points.

[Note: This was passed some time ago.  While I'm not sure
exactly when it was, I believe it was in October 1993.]

========================================

Rule 637 (Mutable)
Form of Amendments

637.  Method of Amendment

      If a Proposal seeks to Amend or Repeal a Rule, that Proposal
      must refer to that Rule either by that Rule's number or by its
      Title as given in the latest distributed Current Rule Set.
      If a Proposal seeks to Amend a Rule, that Proposal must
      explicitly state how in one of two ways: Either the Proposal
      must restate the entire Rule, or the Proposal must quote the
      phrases or words to be deleted (if any) and the phrases or words
      to be inserted (as well as the location of such insertion) or
      appended (if any). If a Proposal attempts to Ammend a Rule
      without following these guidelines, it shall not be considered
      to have been properly submitted, and shall not be Voted upon.

      rules. An Injunction is a statement or series of statements
      specifying an action or actions which must take place. If a
      Judgement is is accompanied by an Injunction, that Injunction
      must be published with the Judgement. All players must abide by
      the Injunction beginning no later than 72 hours after its
      publication unless one of the following conditions then apply:
        - The Judgement which the Injunction accompanies is undergoing
          appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of the appeal
          process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but a proposal
          has been published which would overturn that decision if
          passed, and said proposal has not failed.
        - The validity of the Injunction itself is questioned by a
          pending CFJ.
        - A Judgement upholding the validity of the Injunction is
          undergoing appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of
          the appeal process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but
          a proposal has been published which would overturn that
          decision if passed, and said proposal has not failed.

      A Judgement may not be accompanied by an Injunction unless it is
      specifically permitted elsewhere in the rules. An Injunction
      must be completely consistent with all rules in effect at the
      time of issuance, and must be completely relevant to the matter
      addressed in the corresponding judgement.

      If any Player believes that an Injunction or any part of it does
      not meet the criteria for a valid Injunction, e may submit a CFJ
      to that effect. If the resulting Judgement supports the
      contention that the criteria are not met, the Injunction shall
      be considered illegal and shall have no legal force.

      This rule takes precedence over all rules governing Injunctions.

      retracted, and any resulting adjustments to the published game
      state. The adjustments to the game state must have been
      unambiguously specified within the CFJ, and these adjustments
      must only undo actions which were a direct or indirect result of
      that Move.

          Speaker and the old Speaker becomes a Voter.
        - If there is more than one Winner, the Voter with the highest Point 
          total becomes the new Speaker.  If more than one Voter is
          tied for the highest score, the old Speaker randomly selects
          one of them to become the new Speaker.  The old Speaker
          becomes a voter.
        - All Player's scores are reset to 0.
        - A new Game is begun.  All Rules and Proposals retain the
          status they had at the end of the old Game.

Destruction of and Compensation for Stocks of Leaving Players

728.  Stocks of leaving Players I

      When Player X leaves the game, Stock X shall be destroyed.

      shall be compensated with half the price in Marks that this
      Player paid for the Stock X.
      These Marks shall come from the account of Player X, *before*
      those shall be destroyed, as required by other Rules.

      or Players may hold this title.

      The determination and announcement of assignment and revoking

      accurate means of determining this available to eim, and must
      make the announcement as soon as possible after becoming aware
      of a change in holder of the Title.

      However: To respect some Players' wish for privacy, and in
      view of the secret nature of Marks accounts, a prospective
      Marxist must first be asked if e wants the Title. If not, then
      instead of announcing, "Player x is granted the Patent Title of
      'Marxist', e announces, "Patent Title of 'Marxist' is granted
       to an anonymous Player".

      are inconsequential in all forms of Nomic communication, as long
      as there is no ambiguity in meaning. In other words, the meaning

      be awarded automatically, without need for a Proposal.

      If a Player Wins a Game despite a handicap factor X, then that
      Player shall instead receive the Patent Title "Champion*X",

      Player to Win, over the Points required for an unhandicapped
      Player to Win.

      determined by an Auction, this Auction shall be conducted by an
      Auctioneer, who shall be the Banker, the Banker's chosen willing
      delegate, or any other player as specified in other rules.
 
      Once the identity of the Auctioneer is determined, the Auction
      begins with the Auctioneer making an announcement to the game
      forum stating what  Nomic entity is up for Auction, and that e
      is accepting bids.
 
      Players who wish to participate in the Auction then must
      indicate their interest by sending a bid to the Auctioneer.
 
      The list of players who have indicated an interest is not
      secret, and if it is not included as part of the Auctioneer's
      Announcements the Auctioneer must share it on demand.

Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal

761.  Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal: Adjusting for Abstentions

      When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the Votes which
      have been legally cast shall be counted by the Speaker. If a
      Proposal is not Contested, and there are more FOR votes cast
      then AGAINST votes, then that Proposal shall take effect.  If
      such a Proposal has an equal number of FOR and AGAINST Votes,
      then the Speaker shall decide whether the Proposal shall be
      Adopted, or if that Proposal shall fail. If the Proposal is
      Contested, and the number of FOR votes cast is at least twice
      the number of AGAINST votes cast, then that Proposal shall take
      effect.

      If a Rule will change the actions required of or forbidden to
      the Speaker, and the Speaker opposed the Proposal, then that
      Proposal shall be considered Contested. The Speaker shall
      declare if e opposes the Proposal when e distributes the
      Proposal.

      If, for any reason, Player X ceases to be a Member of Group Y,

      Treasury as specified in the Y Ordinances.  If the Y Ordinances
      are silent on this issue, or if Group Y has ceased to exist,
      then 1/N times the contents of the Y Treasury, rounded
      downwards, shall be transferred to Player X, where N is the
      number of Members of Group Y immediately before Player X ceased
      to be a Member of Group Y.  This transfer is not taxable, and
      may incude a negative number of Points.  This Rule takes

Rule 764 (Mutable)
Mischief

764.  Mischief

      Any Player or Group X may perform an Act of Mischief directed
      at any Player or Group Y.  The permissible forms of Mischief
      are defined in other Rules; such definitions must include a
      positive Price in Coins, or the form of Mischief is not
      permissible.  This Rule explicitly takes precedence over all
      other Rules which purport to determine which forms of Mischief
      are permissible.

      To cause an Act of Mischief,  X  sends to the Public Forum a
      message containing:
      - the Name of the object, Y;
      - the effect of the Act of Mischief;
      - the Number of the Rule which permits the form of Mischief;
      - indication of which Coins in X's account will be used as
      payment for the Act of Mischief.  Coins of Group Y, or the
      Group to which Player Y belongs, may not be used as payment.  

      The effect of the Act of Mischief is applied immediately upon 
      publication of the above message in the Forum.  An additional
      effect of this Act of Mischief is that
      - for each Coin of Group Z spent as payment above, two Points
      are removed from the Z Treasury;
      - the Coins used as payment above are removed from X's account
      and destroyed.

========================================

Rule 766 (Mutable)
Groups

766.  Amend Rule 714.

      A Group is initially formed by a set of Players which has
      registered with the Registrar to form a Group; other Players may
      join later.  Each Group has a Name, a Membership, a Vizier,
      an Ordinancekeepor, a Treasury, an Initial Set of Ordinances,
      and an associated form of Currency, called the <name> Coins,
      where <name> is the Name of the Group.

      1.  The Name may not be the Name of another Group.

      2.  The Membership is a set of Players;  these Players are
      Members of the Group, and all other Players are not.

      3.  Synchronously with the registration of a Group, two Offices
      are created known as the <name> Vizier, and the <name>
      Ordinancekeepor, where <name> is the Name of the Group.
      These Offices may never be empty, and the <name> Vizier and
      <name> Ordinancekeepor must both be a member of <name> Group.
      The <name> Vizier shall inform the Registrar whenever the
      Membership or the Ordinancekeepor of the <name> group changes.
      When the <name> Vizier changes, the new Vizier shall inform the
      Registrar of the change.
      The <name> Ordinancekeepor shall keep an accurate and current
      record of the Ordinances of the <name> Group.

      4.  The Treasury is a repository for Points and Currencies and
      has the same capabilities for holding, trading, and spending
      Points and Currencies as does a Player.

      5.  The Ordinances are a description of the operation of the
      Group.

      6.  The <name> Coins are a form of Currency which is created
      synchronously with the registration of the Group.  The <name>
      Group may create <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be
      placed in the <name> Treasury.  The <name> Group may destroy
      <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be removed from the
      <name> Treasury.

Rule 767 (Mutable)
Votes for Groups

767.  Amend Rule 646.

      If a Group has N Members then it has N Votes for each
      Proposal in addition to those of its Membership.  The
      Ordinances of a Group may determine how and when the Group
      casts its Votes; if the Ordinances are silent on this issue
      then the Group may not cast its Votes.  The Votes of the
      Group are cast when the Vizier sends a message to the Speaker
      to that effect during the Voting Period and this action is
      legitimate insofar as the Ordinances are concerned.

Sanity

779.  Sanity

      When a Player submits a Proposal, e may pay one Mark to the Bank
      (if e has at least one Mark) and impose Sanity on that Proposal.
      E must inform both the Banker and the Speaker when doing so.
      A Proposal which has Sanity imposed upon it is known as a Sane
      Proposal.  The Speaker shall, when e distributes a Sane
      Proposal, inform the Players that it is a Sane Proposal.

      No non-Voter Nomic entity may Vote on a Sane Proposal.  Each
      Voter shall have exactly one Vote on a Sane Proposal, and
      each Voter's Vote shall be counted exactly once on a Sane
      Proposal.

      This rule takes precedence over any rule allowing a non-Voter
      Nomic entity to Vote; over any rule which gives any Voter
      more or less than one Vote on a proposal; and over any
      rule which would cause any Voter's Vote to be counted more or
      less than once.

Rule 785 (Mutable)
Abandonment of Speakerhood

785.  Improve Speaker Succession I

      If the Speaker has abandoned eir post, another new, Temporary
      Speaker is selected according to the "Rules of Succession", or
      if no such rules are defined, the other Player not on hold with
      the highest Score becomes the temporary Speaker.  This does not
      force the Game to be over in this case, and Scores are not reset
      to 0. The Game continues until a Player Wins, at which time a
      new Game is begun and the Winner becomes the real Speaker. The
      Temporary Speaker shall make reasonable effort to obtain the
      former Speaker's materials: proposal queue, voting records, etc.
      but if this is not possible, then the Temporary Speaker shall
      request that these be resubmitted by the Players. If a Speaker
      is replaced in this manner, e has eir score set to minus 2N
      Points immediately, where N is the number of Points required for
      a Player to Win the Game.

      Abandonment is determined as follows: If any Player suspects
      that the Speaker has Abandoned, e sends a message to all Players
      calling on the Speaker to announce eir presence.  The Speaker
      must reply to all Players within one week; if e does not, e is
      considered to have Abandoned.

      Distributor
      <all other Officers in descending Point order>

      When a replacement Speaker is required, all Players who are
      willing to become Speaker shall indicate such in a message, sent
      within three days of the Abandonment or resignation of the
      Speaker.  The old Speaker may not send such a message.  This
      message shall be sent to the Speaker, in the case of a Speaker
      voluntarily giving up his position; or to the first Player who
      called for the Speaker to announce his presence, in the case of
      an Abandoned Speaker.

      After three days, the Player ranking highest on the list
      of succession, out of those who indicated a willingness to

Injunctions on Interpretations of Rules

      When a player makes a CFJ alleging that a Rule should be
      interpreted in a certain way, e shall also submit a list of
      Rules relevant to that CFJ, which must include the Rule in
      question.  If the statement is Judged TRUE, the Judge may
      include with the Judgement an Injuction requiring the Rulekeepor
      to annotate the Rule in question with the Statement in the CFJ
      and the list of relevant Rules.

      The annotation shall remain only until one of the Rules
      in the list of relevant Rules is amended, repealed, or
      transmuted; or until a CFJ determines that the injunction no
      longer applies, as described below.  While it remains, it shall
      guide the application of that Rule.

      If a Player believes that the circumstances which led to the
      Judgement no longer prevail and the annotation is therefore no
      longer applicable, e may submit a CFJ to that effect. If it is
      Judged TRUE, the annotation shall be stricken from the rule set.

      to hold the Office shall notify the Electioneer of that fact
      within three days of eir announcement of the vacancy.  At the
      end of the three day period, the Electioneer shall randomly
      choose one player from those who indicated a willingness to hold

      There may be no more than PL Proposals up for Vote at any given
      time.  "PL" is the Proposal Limit, which is defined to be 15.

      The Speaker shall enforce this by delaying the distribution of
      Proposals in excess of this number. This Rule takes precedence,
      when permitted, over other Rules which require sooner
      distribution.

      If Proposal "Schemes" exist, then for the purpose of the

      least PL/2 additional submitted Proposals. However, e may not do
      this until at least 24 hours after the Proposal queue was last
      closed. As soon as this notification appears on the Public
      Forum, Players are prohibited from submitting any more
      Proposals, and the Speaker shall refuse to accept any which are
      inadvertently submitted.

      When the number of Proposals up for Vote has dropped to PL/2 or
      below, the Speaker shall announce that Proposals are once again
      being accepted. After this appears on the Public Forum, Players

         same committed act, unless the last such Accusation has been
         judged UNDECIDED.

         occur, a random Voter, neither Accuser nor Accused, shall be
         Judge.

      found Guilty of breaking the Rule or committing the Crime, as
      applicable.  If the Statement is judged FALSE, the Accused
      Player has been found Not Guilty of breaking the Rule or
      committing the Crime, as applicable.

      must be made on a distribution list which is potentially
      available to anyone who wishes to subscribe to it.  This
      paragraph takes precendence over other Rules which would require
      a private Scorekeepor notification. The notification need not be
      on a separate message, as long as the Scorekeepor is mentioned,
      and the message is on a list which is received by the
      Scorekeepor.

      Other classes of Point changes whose legal responsibilty for
      reporting is other than the Scorekeepor may be defined by other
      Rules.

Rule 907 (Mutable)
Definition of "As Soon As Possible"

907.

      Whenever a Player is required to perform a certain action "as
      soon as possible", e is required to perform this action before
      performing any other actions which have a less strictly defined
      time requirement.  However, activity of a purely discussionary
      nature is excluded from the ordering requirement, and may be
      conducted at any time.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which stipulate a
      less stringent ordering requirement for the performance of these
      actions.

Rule 908 (Mutable)
Formal Apologies

908.  Time Requirement for Formal Apologies

      If a Player (herein called the Squealer) makes a Call For
      Judgement alleging that a Player (herein called the Ninny) has
      acted or has failed to act in such a way as to be in violation
      of one or more Rules, and this CFJ is Judged TRUE, then the
      Judge must issue an Injunction that the Ninny submit a Formal
      Apology.  This Injunction may also include a list of up to ten
      Prescribed Words.  By a Formal Apology is meant a letter of at
      least 200 words, containing all of the Prescribed Words,
      explaining the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
      for self-improvement, and posted in the Public Forum within 72
      hours of the posting of the Injunction to the Public Forum.
      If the Ninny fails to meet these criteria e shall lose 10
      points.  Within 72 hours of the posting of this Formal Apology,
      the Squealer must either submit a Proposal that the Ninny's
      Apology be accepted, or submit a Proposal that the Ninny's
      Aplology be rejected, but not both.  No other Player may submit
      such a Proposal, and the Squealer may submit only one.  If a
      Proposal to accept the Apology fails, or if a Proposal to reject
      the Apology passes, then the Ninny loses 5 Points.

Rule 910
Appeals and the Justiciar

910.  The Justices and the Justiciar

      Let there be three Players known as the Justices, and an Office
      known as the Justiciar.  The Justiciar shall not receive a
      weekly salary.  The Speaker and the Clerk of the Courts are
      ineligible to be Justiciar.

      The positions of Justice shall be held by the Speaker, the Clerk
      of the Courts, and the Justiciar;  or by their representatives
      as detailed in this Rule.

      The Justices shall have the duty to Judge Statements that have
      been Appealed.  They shall receive the same compensation as
      Judges for each Statement so Judged.

      The Speaker and Clerk may delegate their duties as Justices to
      other willing Players if they desire.  They must do so if a
      Player would otherwise hold more than one position of Justice.

      Any Justice must so delegate eir duties for a particular case
      if e made the original CFJ, if e was the Judge of the original
      CFJ, or if e was Accused by that CFJ of breaking a Rule or
      committing a Crime.

      If no Player is willing to receive the duties of Justice for a
      case, the Clerk of the Courts shall select one randomly.

Rule 911 (Mutable)
Appealing Judgement

911.  Appealing Judgement

      A Judgement may be Appealed upon the insistence of any three
      Players to the Public Forum.

      If a Judgement is successfully Appealed, the Justices shall each
      Judge the Statement as if they were Judges.  They may confer
      with each other on the case before delivering Judgement if they
      desire.  If a Justice should fail to return Judgement in the
      allotted time, e shall be fined three Points for each day by
      which e missed the deadline.  This fine shall be levied by the
      Scorekeepor.

      If a majority of the Justices' Judgements agree, the Statement
      shall be considered to have been Judged accordingly.  Otherwise,
      it shall be considered to have been ruled UNDECIDED.  The
      Justices' reasoning and arguments shall be recorded with the
      original CFJ.

      Once a Judgement has been made, the Justices may make
      Injunctions just as may Judges, provided a majority of them
      agree.

      The decision of the Justices is final; no further Appeal of that
      Statement may be made.

      If the decision of the original Judge of the Statement is
      changed by the Justices, the Judge shall return the compensation
      e received to the Point Reserve.

         (Run for Office) shall be used if a Proposal seeks to place a

      restriction does not apply to Proposals which define new
      Conserved Quantities or Create the initial stock of a new
