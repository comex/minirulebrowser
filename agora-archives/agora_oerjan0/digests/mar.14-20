Foreign Policy Report

Alas, I did not get around to my Report last week.  Finals.  Feel free to
CFJ if you insist...

Anyway, I have interesting news to report.  In answering a question on
rec.games.abstract, I made contact with a previously unknown game of Nomic!

It's based at Valparaiso University in Indiana, and is structured via Suber's
turn structure.  Because of this it proceeds rather slowly; currently they
are at Proposal 330.  The Game is organized out of a user account, rather
than a mailing list.

Ironically, several of the Players are from organizations familiar to those
of us here.  My own Oregon State and Purdue, for example.

When I explained my function as Ambassador and the idea of interNomic
relations, their initial reaction was that they might be interested in
declaring war if they could figure out how to do it.  One idea that was
tentatively proposed was that Nomics might be permitted to make small changes
in each other's Rulesets, perhaps by admitting other Games as Players.

Alternatively, it was jokingly suggested that Nomics in general might unite
against other games and harrass rec.games.chess.  :) 

Contact is proceeding nicely;  I have discovered the above in just the last
two days.
                    Ambassador Garth

: Could you find out how to get in touch with these players?
: 
: To tell you the truth, this particular game of Nomic is a bit hairy for me.
: Too many messages and not enough time to play. I might be interested in
: going to their game (if they accept new players) instead of this one, or
: perhaps starting a game like thiers.

Here is the Ruleset to the Game at Valparaiso University.

                  Ambassador Garth

=======================

Here's the current set:

                              nomic
 
 
                       I. Immutable Rules
 
101. All players must always abide by all the rules then in effect,
     in the form in which they are then in effect.  The rules in
     the Initial Set are in effect whenever a game begins.  The
     Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (immutable) and 201-213
     (mutable).
102. Initially, rules in the 100's are immutable and rules in the
     200's are mutable.  Rules subsequently enacted or transmuted
     (i.e. changed from immutable to mutable or vice versa) may be
     immutable or mutable regardless of their numbers, and rules in
     the Initial Set may be transmuted regardless of their numbers.
103. A rule change is any of the following: (1) the enactment,
     repeal, or amendment of a mutable rule; (2) the enactment,
     repeal, or amendment of an amendment, or (3) the transmutation
     of an immutable rule into a mutable rule, or vice versa. 
     (Note: This definition implies that, at least initially, all
     new rules are mutable.  Immutable rules, as long as they are
     immutable, may not be amended or repealed.  No rule is
     absolutely immune to change.)
104. All rule changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on. 
     They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required
     number of votes.
106. Any proposed rule change must be written down before it is
     voted on.  If adopted, it must guide play in the form in which
     it was voted on.
107. No rule change may take effect earlier than the moment of the
     completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording
     explicitly states otherwise.  No rule change may have
     retroactive application.
108. Each proposed rule change shall be given a rank-order number
     (ordinal number) for reference.  The numbers shall begin with
     301, and each rule change proposed in the proper way shall
     receive the next successive integer, whether or not the
     proposal is adopted.
109. Rule changes that transmute immutable rules into mutable rules
     may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among the
     eligible voters.
110. Mutable rules that are inconsistent in any way with some
     immutable rule (except by proposing to transmute it) are
     wholly void and without effect.  They do not implicitly
     transmute immutable rules into mutable rules and at the same
     time amend them.  Rule changes that transmute immutable rules
     into mutable rules will be effective if and only if they
     explicitly state their transmuting effect.
111. If a rule change as proposed is unclear, ambiguous,
     paradoxical, of destructive of play, or if it arguably
     consists of two or more rule changes compounded or is an
     amendment that makes no difference, or if it is otherwise of
     questionable value, then the other players may suggest
     amendments or argue against the proposal before the vote.  A
     reasonable amount of time must be allowed for this debate. 
     The proponent decides the final form in which the proposal
     is to be voted on and decides the time to end debate and vote. 
     The only cure for a bad proposal is prevention: a negative
     vote.
112. The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be
     changed from achieving n points to any other state of affairs. 
     However, the magnitude of n and the means of earning points
     may be changed, and rules that establish a winner when play
     cannot continue may be enacted and (while they are mutable) be
     amended or repealed.
113. A player always has the option to forfeit the game rather than
     continue to play or incur a game penalty.  No penalty worse
     than losing, in the judgement of the player to incur it, may
     be imposed.
114. There must always be at least one mutable rule.  The adoption
     of rule changes must never become completely impermissible.
115. Rule changes that affect rules needed to allow or apply rule
     changes are as permissible as other rule changes.  Even rule
     changes that amend or repeal their own authority are
     permissible.  No rule change or type of move is impermissible
     solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of
     a rule.
116. Whatever is not explicitly prohibited or regulated by a rule
     is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of
     changing the rules, which is permitted only when a rule or set
     of rules explicitly or implicitly permits it.
 
                        II. Mutable Rules
 
105. An eligible voter is any player who votes within 72 hours of the 
     call of the vote.  A minimum of 3/4 of the players on the up to date 
     nomic list must vote within this time period or the proposal fails. 
201. Players shall alternate in the order specified in the "players"
     file in the nomic account on Herman, taking one whole turn apiece.  
     Turns may not be skipped or passed, and parts of turns may not be 
     omitted.  All players begin with zero points.  Scores are maintained 
     in the file "scores".
202. One turn consists of two parts, in this order: (1) proposing
     one rule change by mailing it to all the players and having it 
     voted on, and (2) the moderator, jcaristi, throwing one die (d6) 
     once and adding the number of points on its face to the proposer's
     score.
203. A rule change is adopted if and only if the vote is a 2/3 majority 
     among the eligible players.  All fractions covered by this rule are 
     minimum requirements.  ie. 6 of 8 is 3/4 and 6 of 8 is 2/3.  5 of 8 
     would not be sufficient.
204. If a rule change can be adopted without unanimity, the
     players who vote against a winning proposal shall receive 3 
     points apiece.  If a rule change can be adopted without unanimity, but
     is adopted by an unanimous vote of all eligible voters, then the
     players who voted for the winning proposal each gain 2 points.  Finally,
     if a rule change can be adopted without unanimity but is approved 
     unanimously, the player who proposed the winning proposal gains an extra
     4 points.
205. An adopted rule change takes full effect at the end of the turn
     containing the vote that adopted it.
206. When a proposed rule change is defeated by a 2/3 majority of the 
     eligible voters, the player who proposed it loses 7 points.
207. Each player always has exactly one vote.
208. The winner is the first player to achieve 100 (positive)
     points.
209. At no time may there be more than 25 mutable rules.
210. Players who have consulted on rule changes prior to submitting them
     must reveal (at the time of submission) the nature of such discussions 
     (and the expected outcome of the rule's adoption) as they pertain to 
     the following: (1) Play of the game or (2) Anticipated future rule
     changes.
     Those formally accused and found in violation of this rule are subject
     to a minimum penalty of one lost turn.  Other penalties are to be 
     decided in accordance with the rules in effect at the time the 
     violation allegedly occurred.  Point bonuses or penalties for the
     accuser(s) are to be decided in the same fashion.
211. If two or more mutable rules conflict with one another, or if
     two or more immutable rules conflict with one another, then
     the rule with the lowest ordinal number takes precedence.
          If at least one of the rules in conflict explicitly says
     of itself that it defers to another rule (or type of rule) or
     takes precedence over another rule (or type of rule), then
     such provisions shall supersede the numerical method for
     determining precedence.
          If two or more rules claim to take precedence over one
     another or to defer to one another, then the numerical method
     must again govern.
212. If players disagree about the legality of a move or the interpretation or
     application of a rule, then the player preceding the one moving is to be 
     the Judge and to decide the question. Disagreement, for the purposes of 
     this rule, may be created by the insistence of any player. Such a process 
     is called invoking judgement. When judgement has been invoked, the next 
     player may not begin his or her turn without the consent of a majority of 
     the other players.
     The Judge's judgement may be overruled only by a unanimous vote of the
     other players, taken before the next turn is begun. If a Judge's judgement
     is overruled, the player preceding the judge in the playing order becomes 
     the new Judge for the question, and so on, except that no player is to be 
     judge during his or her own turn or during the turn of a teammate. Unless 
     a Judge is overruled, on Judge settles all questions arising from the game
     until the next turn is begun, including questions as to his of her own 
     legitimacy and jurisdiction as Judge.
     New Judges are not bound by the decisions of old Judges. New Judges may, 
     however, settle only those questions on which the players currently 
     disagree and that affect the completion of the turn in which judgment was 
     invoked. All decisions by Judges shall be common morality, common logic, 
     and the spirit of the game.
213. If the rules are changed so that further play is impossible,
     or if the legality of a move is impossible to determine with
     finality, or if by the judge's best reasoning, not overruled,
     a move appears equally legal and illegal, then the first
     player who is unable to complete a turn is the winner.
          This rule takes precedence over every other rule
     determining the winner.
313. If a player whose turn it is to submit a rule change or proposal fails 
     to submit at least a preliminary proposal within 72 hours of the report 
     that announces the beginning of a turn, then that player forfeits 
     his/her turn and it becomes the turn of the next player in the scores 
     file.  No scores change as a result of a player forfeiting a turn.
315. If seven consecutive votes on separate proposals, each from a separate
     player, fail to pass, the eighth proposal offered will be accepted 
     without a vote from the other players.
     This proposal cannot contain any clause which would terminate the game 
     before the next proposal can be considered and accepted.
317. All rule proposals must be 100 words or less.  Any attempt to modify an
     existing rule may not increase the number of words present in said rule.
323. Any player in the "players" file may call for the vote on the proposed 
     rule at any time during the course of the turn.  A second on the call by 
     any other player in the "players" file within 24 hours will then signify 
     that the proposal as it stood prior to the call shall be voted on.  The 
     player whose turn it is may still call for his/her own vote at any time 
     seen fit by that player without the need for a second.

THE CURRENT RULESET
Part 1 of 5 

Rules are listed as follows, where NNN represents the Rule number:

========================================

Rule NNN (Immutable or Mutable)
My Own Unofficial Title

NNN.  Semi-Official Rule Title, If There Is One

      Text of Rule

[Note:  I have annotated some Rules to clarify their interpretation.
However, these annotations have no legal force in and of themselves.]

========================================



========================================

Rule 101 (Immutable)
Obey the Rules

101.

      All Players must always abide by all the Rules then in effect,
      in the form in which they are then in effect.  The Rules in the
      Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the first game.
      The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (Immutable) and
      201-219 (Mutable).

========================================

Rule 102 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Rules

102.

      Initially Rules in the 100's are Immutable and Rules in the
      200's are Mutable.  Rules subsequently Enacted or Transmuted
      (that is, changed from Immutable to Mutable or vice versa) may
      be Immutable or Mutable regardless of their Numbers, and Rules
      in the Initial Set may be Transmuted regardless of their Numbers.

========================================

Rule 103 (Immutable)
The Speaker and Voters

103.

      At any time, each Player shall be either a Voter or the Speaker;
      no Player may simultaneously be a Voter and a Speaker. At any
      time, there shall be exactly one Speaker. The term "Player" in
      the Rules shall specifically include both the Voters and the
      Speaker.

========================================

Rule 104 (Immutable)
First Speaker

104.

      The Speaker for the first game shall be Michael Norrish.

========================================

Rule 105 (Immutable)
What Is a Rule Change?

105.

      A Rule Change is any of the following:  (1) the enactment,
      repeal, or amendment of a mutable Rule; or (2) the transmutation
      of an immutable Rule into a mutable Rule or vice versa.
        (Note:  This definition implies that, at least initially, all
      new Rules are Mutable; Immutable Rules, as long as they are
      Immutable, may not be Amended or Repealed; Mutable Rules, as long
      as they are Mutable, may be Amended or Repealed; any Rule of any
      status may be Transmuted; no Rule is absolutely immune to change.)

========================================

Rule 106 (Immutable)
Adopting Proposed Rule Changes

106.

      All Rule Changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on.
      They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required
      number of votes and Quorum is achieved.

========================================

Rule 107 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Must Be Written Down

107.

      Any proposed Rule Change must be written down (or otherwise
      communicated in print media) before it is voted on. If adopted,
      it must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.

========================================

Rule 108 (Immutable)
When May Rule Changes Take Effect?

108.

      No Rule Change may take effect earlier than the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording
      explicitly states otherwise.  No rule change may have retroactive
      application.

========================================

Rule 109 (Immutable)
Rule Numbers

109.

      The Speaker shall give each proposed Rule Change a Number for
      reference.  The numbers shall begin with 301, and each Rule
      Change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next
      successive integer, whether or not the Proposal is adopted.
        If a Rule is Repealed and Reenacted, it receives the Number of
      the Proposal to Reenact it.  If a Rule is Amended or Transmuted,
      it receives the Number of the Proposal to Amend or Transmute it.
 
========================================

Rule 110 (Immutable)
Transmutation of Rules

110.

      Rule Changes that Transmute Immutable Rules into Mutable Rules
      may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among Votes
      legally cast.  Transmutation shall not be implied, but must be
      stated explicitly in a Proposal to take effect.
 
========================================

Rule 111 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Conflicts

111.

      In a conflict between a Mutable and an Immutable Rule, the
      immutable Rule takes precedence and the Mutable Rule shall be
      entirely void.  For the purposes of this Rule a Proposal to
      Transmute an Immutable Rule does not "conflict" with that
      Immutable Rule.
 
========================================

Rule 112 (Immutable)
Winning Must Be by Points

112.

      The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered
      from achieving n points to any other state of affairs.  The
      magnitude of n and the means of earning points may be changed,
      and Rules that establish a Winner when play cannot continue may
      be Enacted and (while they are mutable) be Amended or Repealed.
 
========================================

Rule 113 (Immutable)
Players May Always Forfeit

113.

      A Player always has the option to forfeit the Game rather than
      continue to play or incur a Game penalty.  No penalty worse than
      losing, in the judgment of the Player to incur it, may be
      imposed.

========================================

Rule 114 (Immutable)
At Least One Mutable Rule

114.

      There must always be at least one Mutable Rule.  The adoption of
      Rule Changes must never become completely inpermissible.

========================================

Rule 115 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Which Change Rule-Changing Rules Allowed

115.

      Rule Changes that affect Rules needed to allow or apply
      Rule Changes are as permissible as other Rule Changes.  Even
      Rule Changes that amend or repeal their own authority are
      permissible.  No Rule Change or type of move is impermissible
      solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a
      Rule.

========================================

Rule 116 (Immutable)
Permissibility of the Unprohibited

116.

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
      and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
      which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly or
      implicitly permits it.

========================================

Rule 201 (Mutable)
Quorum

201.

      Quorum for a proposed Rule Change is defined to be 20% of Voters

      Proposal.

========================================

Rule 206 (Mutable)
One Voter, One Vote

206.

      Each Voter has exactly one Vote.  The Speaker may not Vote.

========================================

Rule 208 (Mutable)
End of the Voting Period

208.

      At the end of the prescribed Voting Period on a Proposal, the
      Speaker shall reveal all Votes legally cast on that Proposal. If
      the Speaker's consent may be required for a Proposal to be
      adopted then the Speaker should indicate at that time whether or
      not e gives eir consent.  If the Speaker does not explicitly
      indicate that e refuses to consent to the Proposal, it shall be
      assumed that e consents.

========================================

Rule 212 (Mutable)
Resolving Rule Conflicts

212.

      If two or more Mutable Rules conflict with one another, or if
      two or more Immutable Rules conflict with one another, then the
      Rule with the lowest ordinal Number takes precedence.
        If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of rule) or takes
      precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.
        If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

========================================

Rule 217 (Mutable)
Judgements Must Accord with the Rules

217.

      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however, if
      the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the Statement
      to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider Game Custom and the
      Spirit of the Game before applying other standards.

========================================

Rule 312 (Mutable)
A Point for Voting

312.

      If a Voter votes, he gets one (1) point at the end of the Voting
      Period.

========================================

Rule 355 (Mutable)
Determining When a Rule Has Been Broken

355.  Determining when a Rule has been broken:

      If a Player believes that any Player has not abided by a Rule
      then in effect, in the form in which it was then in effect, then
      the Player may invoke Judgement on a Statement to that effect.
      However,
        -The Accusing player immediately loses 5 points.
        -No Player may be so Accused of actions committed before the
         adoption of this Rule or more than 30 days before the
         Accusation.
        -No Player may be so Accused more than once concerning the
         same committed act, unless the last such Accusation has been
         judged UNDECIDED.
        -The following exception takes precedence over previous Rules 
         concerning Judgement: Neither Accusing nor Accused Player may
         act as Judge for the Accusation; in any case where this would
         occur, a random Voter, neither Accuser nor Accused, shall be
         Judge.
      If the Statement is judged TRUE, the Accused Player has been
      convicted of breaking the Rule.  If the Statement is judged
      FALSE, the Accused Player has been acquitted of breaking the
      Rule.

========================================

Rule 376 (Mutable)
When Does a Rule Change Take Effect?

376.  Time that a rule change takes effect:

      An adopted rule change takes full effect at the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it.

      and time given in the line starting with "Date:" of the Nomic
      listserver message send by the Benevolent Speaker, announcing
      the result of the vote on the corresponding proposal.

388.  Starting a new Game:

      Whenever a new game of Nomic is begun, the status of the new
      Game when it begins shall be the same as the status of the old
      Game when it ended, in all respects where the Rules do not
      decide otherwise.

========================================

Rule 399 (Mutable)
The Office of the Rulekeepor

399.  The Office of the Rulekeepor:

      The Rulekeepor shall maintain a complete list of the current
      Rules, and post this list to all Players at least once a week.
      
      So long as the Rulekeepor is in Office, the Speaker is not

Transfer of Power of the Mighty Speaker

402.  Transfer of Power of the Mighty Speaker:

       1) The Present Mighty Speaker shall forward copies of all
          necessary materials for the performance of his Office to the
          Prospective Mighty Speaker.
       2) The Prospective Mighty Speaker shall acknowledge the receipt

       3) The Present Mighty Speaker shall post a message to the
          listserv announcing the official transfer of power, which
          occurs at the "Date:" of the Present Mighty Speaker's
          posting.
      
      The Present Mighty Speaker remains in Office until the successful
      completion of step 3.

========================================

Rule 404 (Mutable)
Legality of Proposals

404.  Legality of Proposals:

      As long as a Proposal satisfies all requirements in place at the
      time of its making for the proper making of Proposals, the act
      of making such a Proposal is legal regardless of its content.
      It is legal to propose a Rule which conflicts with other Rules
      or with itself, which is paradoxical, or which cannot be
      applied.

========================================

Rule 405 (Mutable)
No Vacations for Officers

405.  No Vacations for Officers:

      No Officer may be 'On Hold' while holding an Office.  If a

      Court may never be selected as a Judge.

      As a salary for carrying out his duties, he will receive 5
      points at the end of every seven days he is in Office, counting
      from his assumption of the Office.

      The initial holder of this Office shall be the Player who
      submitted this Proposal.

========================================

Rule 407 (Mutable)
Invoking Judgement

407.  Clerk of the Courts, Part II: Invoking Judgement:

      If Players disagree about the legality of a Move or the
      interpretation or application of a Rule, then a Player may
      invoke Judgement by submitting a Statement for Judgement to the
      Clerk of the Courts.  Disagreement, for the purposes of this
      Rule, may be created by the insistence of any Player.  When
      Judgement is invoked, the Clerk of the Courts must, as soon as
      possible, select a Judge as described in the Rules.  The Clerk
      of the Courts must then distribute the Statement to be judged,
      along with the identity of the Judge, to all Players.

========================================

Rule 408 (Mutable)

      and a new Judge is selected.  A Judgement is delivered by
      submitting that Judgement to the Clerk of the Courts, who must
      then distribute that Judgement to all Players as soon as
      possible.

========================================

Rule 413 (Mutable)
Winning by Paradox

413.  Winning By Paradox:

      If the Rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or
      if the legality of some action cannot be determined with
      finality, or if some action appears equally legal and illegal,
      then a player may Call For Judgement on a Statement to that
      effect.  If the Statement is judged TRUE, then the same Judge
      who judged the Statement TRUE must declare the most recent
      passed Proposal X such that the Statement was not TRUE before
      the passage of Proposal X, or declare that there is no such
      Proposal.  (Until the Judge does this, the Judgment is not
      valid.)  If the Judgement of TRUE is not overruled, then the
      Player who called for Judgement is declared the Winner of the
      game.
      
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared that
      there is no such Proposal X, the game is ended, with no
      provisions for restarting it.
      
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared such
      a Proposal X, the following actions are taken:
         - all Players remain active,
         - all Proposals curently being Voted upon are removed from
           consideration for Voting,
         - the scores for all Players are set to 0 (zero),
         - the Rules and explicit game custom are reverted to the
           state they were in before Proposal X was passed,
         - a Benevolent Speaker for the next Game is chosen:
              -If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the
               Benevolent Speaker, and the old Benevolent Speaker
               becomes a Voter,
              -If there is more than one Winner, the Benevolent
               Speaker randomly selects one of the Winners, who
               becomes the new Benevolent Speaker, and the old
               Benevolent Speaker becomes a Voter,
         - and a new Game is begun.

========================================

Rule 415 (Mutable)
How To Submit a Proposal

415.  "How a Proposal is Submitted":

      A Proposal by a Voter shall be made by submitting it to the
      Mighty Speaker. As soon as possible after receiving the
      Proposal, the Mighty Speaker shall assign the Proposal a Number
      and distribute the Proposal along with its number to all
      Players.
      
      The Mighty Speaker may also make Proposals. The Mighty Speaker
      must process all pending Voter-submitted Proposals first, and
      may then Process Proposals of the Mighty Speaker, assigning
      these Proposals a number and distributing them in the same
      fashion as any other Proposal.

========================================

Rule 417 (Mutable)
The Nomic Archivist

417.  Establishment of the Office of Archivist:

      That there be established an office known as the Nomic
      Archivist, which shall be governed by the default Rules
      concerning official posts. The initial duties of the Nomic
      Archivist shall be to record the passage and failure of
      Proposals, to maintain a "historical record" (defined below)
      of the Ruleset, to maintain a list of Judgements and their case
      histories, and to maintain a list of game Winners in past games.
      The Archivist is free to comment on the historical records as
      they see fit, but such commentary must be clearly delimited
      from the historical material. Where the material being stored
      does not already admit a classification method, the Archivist
      is free to design one themselves.

      The "historical record" of the Ruleset maintained by the
      Archivist is one that includes all rules ever part of the nomic
      Ruleset, annotated with information as to their ultimate fate,
      whether Repealed or Amended etc. This record of the Ruleset has
      no legal force.

      The duties required of the Archivist may be changed with their
      consent and at the request of the Office's controlling body
      (whatsoever that may be). Initially, the controlling body of
      this Office shall be all Players, and any request to change the
      duties must therefore be supported by a majority of Players
      "speaking" to the request.  Naturally, default Rules for
      Offices may establish a different controlling body for this
      Office.
      
      The salary of the Archivist office shall be determined by its
      controlling body. Initially, its salary shall be 5 points and
      one coin of the office-holder's group per week.
      
      The initial office-holder for this post shall be Michael
      Norrish.

========================================

Rule 434 (Mutable)
Game May Be Won By CFJ

434.  Judgement Required to Win (and Timing of Win):

      If a Player believes that he has won the Game, he may submit a
      CFJ to that effect.  If it is returned with the Judgement TRUE
      (and that Judgement is not Appealed), then he has won the Game
      as of the delivery of that Judgement.  If the Judgement is TRUE,
      but is Appealed, but is sustained (and no Proposal to reverse
      the verdict is made), then he has won the Game as of the
      delivery of the Appeal verdict.  If such a verdict is sustained,
      challenged by Proposal, but the Proposal does not pass, he has
      won the Game as of the completion of the Vote on that Proposal.

      Judgement on a CFJ to win the Game may *not* be delivered until
      at least 72 hours after its official announcement, in order to
      give time for the Judge to accept input from the community.

      This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which specifies
      the exact moment at which a Game is won.

[Note: Implicit Game Custom dictates that, despite the title,
this rule does not *require* a CFJ in order to win the game.]

========================================

Rule 450 (Mutable)
Game Entities May Not Be Arbitrarily Changed

450.  Game Entities may not be Arbitrarily Changed:

      Any Entity which is created by the Nomic Rules, and which exists only
      within the context of the current Game of Nomic, such as Points,
      Votes, etc. may *not* be changed by any action other than those
      specified by the Rules.

========================================

Rule 451 (Mutable)
Determination of Judgement--Timing

451.  Timing of CFJ Results:

      When a CFJ makes a Statement about the current state of the
      Game, the result of that CFJ shall be TRUE if and only if the
      Judge feels that that Statement was correct at the time that the
      CFJ was *issued*. Any changes that have happened in the time
      between the issuing of the CFJ and its delivery must be figured
      in to find the correct current state.

      on the Rule Set. If said Proposal has a Title, this Declaration
      shall appear on the line immediately below that Title. In any
      case, the Declaration shall appear in parentheses. The
      Declarations shall be as follows:

         (Creates a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes a new
            Rule to come into existance.
         (Amends a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes an
            existing Rule to change wording or form.
         (Repeals a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes an
            existing Rule to cease to exist.
         (Transmutes a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes a
            Mutable Rule to become Immutable, or vice versa.
         (Other) shall be used if no other Declaration has been
            defined which describes the Proposal.

      Additional legislation may define additional legal Declarations
      or change the presentation of the Declaration, but this Rule
      shall take precedence in all other cases.

      scores. If a Player feels that the posted scores are in error,
      e may make a Call for Judgement, stating what e believes to be
      the correct scores. If the resulting Judgement is TRUE, then the
      scores shall be adjusted to the scores set forth in the Call for
      Judgement, modified further by any score changes which took
      place since the time the Call for Judgement was made. If such a
      Call for Judgement is not made within seven days of the posting

      While On Hold, a Player may not communicate with any other
      Player in any way regarding the Game, with the exception of
      notifying the Speaker of the desire to stop being On Hold. This
      prohibits the Player from Voting, proposing Proposals,
      campaigning, or discussing the Game whatsoever with another
      Player. The Player is also absolved of any duties which would
      require said participation, including appointment as a Judge.

      A player may not be deregistered from the game, except by that
      player (or the Registrar, as specified elsewhere) announcing
      that he forfeits.  When a player forfeits, he remains registered
      for a length of time equal to the longest possible voting period
      on a proposal. At the end of this time, he is deregistered.
 
      During the time between forfeiting and being deregistered, the
      player may not vote or make a proposal.  The player
      automatically refuses any selection for judgement, or any other
      voluntary appointed duties.
 
      If, at any time during this period, the player announces that
      they have changed their mind about forfeiting, then these
      restrictions are instantly revoked, and the deregistration does
      not take place.

          - clearly allege that the current published game state is
            incorrect, and in what respects.

      conditions shall be deemed invalid and shall not be accepted for
      Judgement by the Clerk of the Courts. However, this Rule shall
      defer to rules which explictly permit CFJs that do not
      necessarily meet the above conditions.

========================================

Rule 663 (Mutable)
Injunctions--General

663.  General Rules For Injunctions

      There shall be an entity known as an Injunction, which may
      accompany certain Judgements of TRUE or FALSE as provided in the
      rules. An Injunction is a statement or series of statements
      specifying an action or actions which must take place. If a
      Judgement is is accompanied by an Injunction, that Injunction
      must be published with the Judgement. All players must abide by
      the Injunction beginning no later than 72 hours after its
      publication unless one of the following conditions then apply:
        - The Judgement which the Injunction accompanies is undergoing
          appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of the appeal
          process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but a proposal
          has been published which would overturn that decision if
          passed, and said proposal has not failed.
        - The validity of the Injunction itself is questioned by a
          pending CFJ.
        - A Judgement upholding the validity of the Injunction is
          undergoing appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of
          the appeal process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but
          a proposal has been published which would overturn that
          decision if passed, and said proposal has not failed.

      A Judgement may not be accompanied by an Injunction unless it is
      specifically permitted elsewhere in the rules. An Injunction
      must be completely consistent with all rules in effect at the
      time of issuance, and must be completely relevant to the matter
      addressed in the corresponding judgement.

      If any Player believes that an Injunction or any part of it does
      not meet the criteria for a valid Injunction, e may submit a CFJ
      to that effect. If the resulting Judgement supports the
      contention that the criteria are not met, the Injunction shall
      be considered illegal and shall have no legal force.

      This rule takes precedence over all rules governing Injunctions.

========================================

Rule 664 (Mutable)
Illegal Injuctions are Crimes

664.  Judicial Accountability

      If a Judge hands down an Injunction which is determined illegal
      by a CFJ, then a Criminal Court may find em GUILTY of a Class C
      crime.

Rule 665 (Mutable)
Injuction--Retracting an Illegal Move

665.  Specific Injunctions, part I

      Judgement supports the allegation, the Judge may include with
      the Judgement an Injunction specifying that the move is to be
      retracted, and any resulting adjustments to the published game
      state. The adjustments to the game state must have been
      unambiguously specified within the CFJ, and these adjustments
      must only undo actions which were a direct or indirect result of
      that Move.

========================================

Rule 669 (Mutable)
To Disobey an Injunction is Criminal

669.  Contempt of Court

      If the rules require a Player to obey an Injunction and e fails
      to do so, then a Criminal Court may find that Player GUILTY of a
      Class C crime.

========================================

Rule 675 (Mutable)
Filling a Vacant COTC

      replacement shall be appointed randomly by the Speaker from the
      list of Active Players, excluding the Speaker and the most
      recent Clerk of the Courts. A tentative replacement shall be
      asked if e wants the Office, and if not, a new one shall be
      selected in the same manner.

      require the Clerk of the Courts to fill a vacant Office of Clerk
      of the Courts.

      If any agreement among Players includes any transfer of Points
      between two Players then each such transfer shall be in
      accordance with the above.  But this Rule shall not be construed
      as having any bearing on the legality or legal enforceability of
      any terms of said agreement which do not involve such a
      transfer.

      All Nomic Entities shall abide by the above limits whenever
      Points are traded.  If a Nomic Entity must trade Points by the
      current Rules but would end up breaking the above limits, then

Rule 710 (Mutable)
Criminal Court

710.  Criminal Court Amendment

      If a Player has been formally Accused of a Crime and that Player
      denies that a Crime was committed, or the Accused Player does
      not respond to the Accusation within 72 hours, or within 72
      hours of the time that the Accused Player ceases to be On Hold,
      should e be On Hold when the Accusation is made, then the
      Accusing Player may call for Criminal Court. To do so, the
      Accusing Player shall notify the Clerk of the Courts of the
      intent to begin Criminal Court and shall send a copy of the
      Accusation to the Clerk of the Courts.
      A Judge is then selected exactly as in the case of a call for
      Judgement, and Players are notified exactly as in the case of a
      call for Judgement, except that the reasons for the Guilt of the
      Accused need not be distributed to all Players, only the
      Accusing Player, the Accused, and the Crime. When a Judge has
      been finally selected, the Clerk of the Courts shall notify the
      Accusing and the Accused Player of the identity of the Judge.

      As soon as the Accused Player, who shall be known as the
      Defendant, and the Accusing Player, who shall be known as the
      Prosecuter, have been notified of the identity of the Judge who
      has accepted the appointment, they shall both send all pertinent
      information regarding this Crime to the Judge. When each party
      has sent all information, they shall indicate so by explicitly
      stating such in their last message to the Judge. The Judge then
      has one week from the time at which both such messgaes have been
      recieved to return a Verdict, following all Rules exactly as if
      returning a Judgement in the case of a call for Judgement. The
      Judge shall not return a Verdict until at least 72 hours after
      the identity of the Judge is announced so that other interested
      Players can also send information to the Judge.

      A Verdict may be GUILTY, NOT GUILTY, or UNDECIDED. If the
      Verdict is GUILTY, then the Defendant shall suffer all the
      penalties relevant to the Class of Crime of which e was found
      GUILTY. If the Verdict is NOT GUILTY, then there shall be no
      effect. If the Verdict is UNDECIDED, then it shall be as if
      there had been no Criminal Court.  A Criminal Court may be
      Appealed exactly as a Call for Judgement may be Appealed,
      except that all information pertinent to the Court shall be
      given to all involved in the Appeal, and if the Appeal OVERRULES
      the Verdict, then the process of a Criminal Court shall occur
      again automatically.
      If other Rules designate another Appeals system for a Criminal
      Court, those Rules shall take precedence over this Rule.

========================================

Rule 713 (Mutable)
Welfare

713.  Welfare Reform

      There shall be a quantity known as the Poverty Line, which shall
      be equal to 20% of the average score of all Active Players. If
      any active Player's score is less than the Poverty Line at the
      beginning of the Nomic Week, then each such active Player's
      score shall be increased to the Poverty Line by transferring
      points from the Point Reserve, provided there are sufficient
      points therein to cover all such transfers.

      A Player shall not receive points under this rule if e
      voluntarily transferred points to another Player during the
      previous Nomic Week.

      The Registrar shall keep a record of all currently formed
      Groups, their Memberships, Viziers, and Ordinancekeepors; as

      Registrar a message (known as the Application) containing a list
      of the set X of Players, all of whom must be unaffiliated with
      any other Group; and a name for the proposed Group.  The
      Application may also contain an Initial Set of Ordinances
      for the Group.

      When the Registrar receives Applications from three Players in
      X, having identical information (as described above), all within
      a week of each other, than the Group shall be registered, with
      the given Name and Initial Set of Ordinances (if one was
      included), and the three Players who sent Applications as
      Members of that Group.  The Registrar shall then post in the
      Public Forum that the Group has been formed, along with its Name
      and Membership.

      A Player not affiliated with any Group may become a Member of a
      Group at any time after Registration of the Group only as
      specified in that Group's Ordinances, so long as they do not
      conflict with the rules.  However, other rules may establish
      other restrictions on Group Membership, and no Player shall
      become a Member of a Group without eir sending such a request to
      the Vizier of that Group.

      A Player may never be a Member of more than one Group.

========================================

Rule 721 (Mutable)
The Ordinances, and Defaults

721.  The Ordinances, and Defaults

      All Members of a Group must obey the Ordinances of that Group at
      all times, so long as the Ordinances do not conflict with the
      Rules.

      The Ordinances of a Group may specify:

      1.   how the Ordinances of that Group may be changed, or that
      they may not be changed.  If the Ordinances do not so specify,
      then the Ordinances shall be changed only upon unanimous
      agreement of all Members of that Group.

      2.  the Vizier of the Group, so long as the Vizier is a Member
      of that Group.  If the Ordinances of a Group do not so specify,
      the Vizier shall be the Player whose Application for that Group
      was received first by the Registrar, if e is still a Member of
      that Group.

      3.  the Ordinancekeepor of the Group, so long as the
      Ordinancekeepor is a Member of that Group.  If the Ordinances do
      not so specify, then the Vizier of that Group shall also be its
      Ordinancekeepor.

      4.  How the Points or Currencies in the Group's Treasury shall
      be spent, so long as it does not conflict with the Rules.  A
      Group may spend Points or Currencies in the same manner as a
      Player.  When Points or Currencies are to be spent from the
      Group's Treasury, the Vizier of that Group shall inform the
      Scorekeepor or Recordkeepor for the Currency, as is appropriate.

========================================

Rule 724 (Mutable)
Winning the Game

724.  Requirements for Winning

      The Winner is the first Voter to achieve sufficiently many
      Points.  The minimum number of Points required for Player X to
      win is 10*N*(1+G/6), where N is the number of Players currently
      registered in the Game, and G is the number of Games which
      Player X has already won.  If more than one Voter achieves this
      condition simultaneously, then all such Voters win.  When a Game
      ends in this manner:
        - If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the new
          Speaker and the old Speaker becomes a Voter.
        - If there is more than one Winner, the Voter with the highest Point 
          total becomes the new Speaker.  If more than one Voter is
          tied for the highest score, the old Speaker randomly selects
          one of them to become the new Speaker.  The old Speaker
          becomes a voter.
        - All Player's scores are reset to 0.
        - A new Game is begun.  All Rules and Proposals retain the
          status they had at the end of the old Game.

========================================

Rule 725 (Mutable)
Stocks

725.  Timing of Stock point transfer.

      Let there be for each Player one Currency called X Stock,
      where X is the name of the Player.

      On Friday Noon GMT 5% of the Points of Player X (with a minimum
      of two Points) shall be transfered to the Player (or Players)
      who holds Stock X.

      At the passing of this Proposal the Bank has possession of all
      Stocks.  During the following week the Banker shall collect the
      bids in Marks.  Those bids have to be made by the Players
      (either alone or acting together on the same Stock) in a message
      to the server.  No bid shall be made, which can not be covered
      by the Marks in  he bidders Bank account (to be verified by the
      Banker.)

      After one week each of the Stocks shall be transfered from the
      Bank to the highest bidder. If two or more bids for Stock X are
      exactly equal, the Stock shall go to player X (if one of the
      highest bidders), or to the Player with the lowest score.

      If a given Stock X is bought by Player X, the Marks of the bid
      shall be transfered from Player X to the Bank.
      If a given Stock X is bought by another Player (or Players) then
      Player X, the Marks of the bid shall go from this Player(s) to
      Player X.

      The Banker shall keep track of the Stocks held by each Player.

========================================

Rule 726 (Mutable)
Starting Points and No Unpermitted Point Changes

726.  Initial scores

      All Players begin with 0 Points, except that new Voters who
      enter part-way through a Game in progress shall be given the
      average of the scores of all active Players scores, not
      including those scores, which happen to be negative.
      Points may not be gained, lost, or traded except as explicitly
      stated in the Rules.

========================================

Rule 728 (Mutable)
Destruction of and Compensation for Stocks of Leaving Players

728.  Stocks of leaving Players I

      When Player X leaves the game, Stock X shall be destroyed.
      If Stock X was held at that time by another Player, this Player
      shall be compensated with half the price in Marks that this
      Player paid for the Stock X.
      These Marks shall come from the account of Player X, *before*
      those shall be destroyed, as required by other Rules.
      If there are not enough Marks available, the deficit shall be
      paid by the Bank.
      This Rule applies to the Stock of Players that have left the
      game before adoption of this Proposal.

      own Stock, in which case the proceedings shall go to the Bank.

========================================

Rule 733 (Mutable)
Default Rules for Officers

733.  Default Rules for Officers

      An Official is any Player who has been Appointed or Elected to
      an Office specified in the Rules. A Judge is not an Officer.
      An Officer may be replaced by another Player, by a Proposal
      stating so, and that Proposal passes.
      An Officer may resign at any time, provided e appoints a
      successor.
      If an Officer resigns while a Proposal is being voted upon to
      replace eim, the Player proposed will by eis Successor.
      This Rule applies to general Offices, and therefore defers to
      Rules for specific Offices.
      Running for office

========================================

Rule 736 (Mutable)
The Marxist

736.  The Marxist

      Let there be the Patent Title known as "Marxist", which is
      awarded to the Player with the most Marks, or if tied, to the
      Players with the most Marks. Only the current richest Player
      or Players may hold this title.

      The determination and announcement of assignment and revoking
      of the Title is made by the Banker, who must use the most
      accurate means of determining this available to eim, and must
      make the announcement as soon as possible after becoming aware
      of a change in holder of the Title.

      However: To respect some Players' wish for privacy, and in
      view of the secret nature of Marks accounts, a prospective
      Marxist must first be asked if e wants the Title. If not, then
      instead of announcing, "Player x is granted the Patent Title of
      'Marxist', e announces, "Patent Title of 'Marxist' is granted
       to an anonymous Player".

========================================

Rule 747 (Mutable)
Definition of a Conserved Quantity

747.  Definition of a Conserved Quantity

      An Entity is only a Conserved Quantity if a Rule explicitly
      states such. A Conserved Quantity may only be Created or
      Destroyed as explicitly stated by the Rules. If a Conserved
      Quantity is given to an Entity, and no Rule states where that
      Conserved Quantity is to be taken from, then the transfer shall
      not take place. If a Conserved Quantity is taken from an Entity,
      and no Rule states where that Conserved Quantity is to be
      transfered to, then the Conserved Quantity shall be transfered
      to the Bank.

Spelling and Grammar Errors

754.  Spelling and Grammar Errors

      Differences in spelling, grammar, or dialect, or the
      substitution of a word or phrase by a synonym or abbreviation,
      are inconsequential in all forms of Nomic communication, as long
      as there is no ambiguity in meaning. In other words, the meaning
      or validity of such communication is not altered in any way by
      such discrepancies.

      determined by an Auction, this Auction shall be conducted by an
      Auctioneer, who shall be the Banker, the Banker's chosen willing
      delegate, or any other player as specified in other rules.
 
      Once the identity of the Auctioneer is determined, the Auction

      forum stating what  Nomic entity is up for Auction, and that e
      is accepting bids.
 
      Players who wish to participate in the Auction then must
      indicate their interest by sending a bid to the Auctioneer.
 
      The list of players who have indicated an interest is not

Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal

761.  Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal: Adjusting for Abstentions

      When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the Votes which
      have been legally cast shall be counted by the Speaker. If a
      Proposal is not Contested, and there are more FOR votes cast
      then AGAINST votes, then that Proposal shall take effect.  If
      such a Proposal has an equal number of FOR and AGAINST Votes,
      then the Speaker shall decide whether the Proposal shall be
      Adopted, or if that Proposal shall fail. If the Proposal is
      Contested, and the number of FOR votes cast is at least twice
      the number of AGAINST votes cast, then that Proposal shall take
      effect.

      If a Rule will change the actions required of or forbidden to
      the Speaker, and the Speaker opposed the Proposal, then that
      Proposal shall be considered Contested. The Speaker shall
      declare if e opposes the Proposal when e distributes the
      Proposal.

      If, for any reason, Player X ceases to be a Member of Group Y,
      then Player X shall recieve a share of the contents of the Y
      Treasury as specified in the Y Ordinances.  If the Y Ordinances
      are silent on this issue, or if Group Y has ceased to exist,
      then 1/N times the contents of the Y Treasury, rounded
      downwards, shall be transferred to Player X, where N is the
      number of Members of Group Y immediately before Player X ceased
      to be a Member of Group Y.  This transfer is not taxable, and
      may incude a negative number of Points.  This Rule takes

Rule 764 (Mutable)
Mischief

764.  Mischief

      Any Player or Group X may perform an Act of Mischief directed
      at any Player or Group Y.  The permissible forms of Mischief
      are defined in other Rules; such definitions must include a 
      positive Price in Coins, or the form of Mischief is not
      permissible.  This Rule explicitly takes precedence over all
      other Rules which purport to determine which forms of Mischief
      are permissible.

      To cause an Act of Mischief,  X  sends to the Public Forum a
      message containing:
      - the Name of the object, Y;
      - the effect of the Act of Mischief;
      - the Number of the Rule which permits the form of Mischief;
      - indication of which Coins in X's account will be used as
      payment for the Act of Mischief.  Coins of Group Y, or the
      Group to which Player Y belongs, may not be used as payment.  

      The effect of the Act of Mischief is applied immediately upon 
      publication of the above message in the Forum.  An additional
      effect of this Act of Mischief is that
      - for each Coin of Group Z spent as payment above, two Points
      are removed from the Z Treasury;
      - the Coins used as payment above are removed from X's account
      and destroyed.

Rule 766 (Mutable)
Groups

766.  Amend Rule 714.

      A Group is initially formed by a set of Players which has
      registered with the Registrar to form a Group; other Players may
      join later.  Each Group has a Name, a Membership, a Vizier,
      an Ordinancekeepor, a Treasury, an Initial Set of Ordinances,
      and an associated form of Currency, called the <name> Coins,
      where <name> is the Name of the Group.

      1.  The Name may not be the Name of another Group.

      2.  The Membership is a set of Players;  these Players are
      Members of the Group, and all other Players are not.

      3.  Synchronously with the registration of a Group, two Offices
      are created known as the <name> Vizier, and the <name>
      Ordinancekeepor, where <name> is the Name of the Group.
      These Offices may never be empty, and the <name> Vizier and
      <name> Ordinancekeepor must both be a member of <name> Group.
      The <name> Vizier shall inform the Registrar whenever the
      Membership or the Ordinancekeepor of the <name> group changes.
      When the <name> Vizier changes, the new Vizier shall inform the
      Registrar of the change.
      The <name> Ordinancekeepor shall keep an accurate and current
      record of the Ordinances of the <name> Group.

      4.  The Treasury is a repository for Points and Currencies and
      has the same capabilities for holding, trading, and spending
      Points and Currencies as does a Player.

      5.  The Ordinances are a description of the operation of the
      Group.

      6.  The <name> Coins are a form of Currency which is created
      synchronously with the registration of the Group.  The <name>
      Group may create <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be
      placed in the <name> Treasury.  The <name> Group may destroy
      <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be removed from the
      <name> Treasury.

Rule 710 (Mutable)
Criminal Court

710.  Criminal Court Amendment

      If a Player has been formally Accused of a Crime and that Player
      denies that a Crime was committed, or the Accused Player does
      not respond to the Accusation within 72 hours, or within 72
      hours of the time that the Accused Player ceases to be On Hold,
      should e be On Hold when the Accusation is made, then the
      Accusing Player may call for Criminal Court. To do so, the
      Accusing Player shall notify the Clerk of the Courts of the
      intent to begin Criminal Court and shall send a copy of the
      Accusation to the Clerk of the Courts.
      A Judge is then selected exactly as in the case of a call for
      Judgement, and Players are notified exactly as in the case of a
      call for Judgement, except that the reasons for the Guilt of the
      Accused need not be distributed to all Players, only the
      Accusing Player, the Accused, and the Crime. When a Judge has
      been finally selected, the Clerk of the Courts shall notify the
      Accusing and the Accused Player of the identity of the Judge.

      As soon as the Accused Player, who shall be known as the
      Defendant, and the Accusing Player, who shall be known as the
      Prosecuter, have been notified of the identity of the Judge who
      has accepted the appointment, they shall both send all pertinent
      information regarding this Crime to the Judge. When each party
      has sent all information, they shall indicate so by explicitly
      stating such in their last message to the Judge. The Judge then
      has one week from the time at which both such messgaes have been
      recieved to return a Verdict, following all Rules exactly as if
      returning a Judgement in the case of a call for Judgement. The
      Judge shall not return a Verdict until at least 72 hours after
      the identity of the Judge is announced so that other interested
      Players can also send information to the Judge.

      A Verdict may be GUILTY, NOT GUILTY, or UNDECIDED. If the
      Verdict is GUILTY, then the Defendant shall suffer all the
      penalties relevant to the Class of Crime of which e was found
      GUILTY. If the Verdict is NOT GUILTY, then there shall be no
      effect. If the Verdict is UNDECIDED, then it shall be as if
      there had been no Criminal Court.  A Criminal Court may be
      Appealed exactly as a Call for Judgement may be Appealed,
      except that all information pertinent to the Court shall be
      given to all involved in the Appeal, and if the Appeal OVERRULES
      the Verdict, then the process of a Criminal Court shall occur
      again automatically.
      If other Rules designate another Appeals system for a Criminal
      Court, those Rules shall take precedence over this Rule.

Rule 713 (Mutable)
Welfare

713.  Welfare Reform

      There shall be a quantity known as the Poverty Line, which shall
      be equal to 20% of the average score of all Active Players. If
      any active Player's score is less than the Poverty Line at the
      beginning of the Nomic Week, then each such active Player's
      score shall be increased to the Poverty Line by transferring
      points from the Point Reserve, provided there are sufficient
      points therein to cover all such transfers.

      A Player shall not receive points under this rule if e
      voluntarily transferred points to another Player during the
      previous Nomic Week.

Registrar Keeps Track of Groups

715.  Registrar as GroupMeister

      The Registrar shall keep a record of all currently formed
      Groups, their Memberships, Viziers, and Ordinancekeepors; as
      well as a record of all unaffiliated Players; and such other
      data as are required in order to make the Group Report.

========================================

Rule 716 (Mutable)
How to Form a Group

716.  Registration of Groups

      A Group shall be registered with the Registrar under the
      following conditions.  At least three Players in a certain
      subset X of the set of active Players must each send the
      Registrar a message (known as the Application) containing a list
      of the set X of Players, all of whom must be unaffiliated with
      any other Group; and a name for the proposed Group.  The
      Application may also contain an Initial Set of Ordinances
      for the Group.

      When the Registrar receives Applications from three Players in
      X, having identical information (as described above), all within
      a week of each other, than the Group shall be registered, with
      the given Name and Initial Set of Ordinances (if one was
      included), and the three Players who sent Applications as
      Members of that Group.  The Registrar shall then post in the
      Public Forum that the Group has been formed, along with its Name
      and Membership.

========================================

Rule 717 (Mutable)
The Group Report

717.  The Group Report

      Not less than once each Nomic Week, the Registrar must post the
      Group Report in the Public Forum.  This report shall
      contain:

      A Player not affiliated with any Group may become a Member of a
      Group at any time after Registration of the Group only as
      specified in that Group's Ordinances, so long as they do not
      conflict with the rules.  However, other rules may establish
      other restrictions on Group Membership, and no Player shall
      become a Member of a Group without eir sending such a request to
      the Vizier of that Group.

      A Player may never be a Member of more than one Group.

========================================

Rule 721 (Mutable)
The Ordinances, and Defaults

721.  The Ordinances, and Defaults

      All Members of a Group must obey the Ordinances of that Group at
      all times, so long as the Ordinances do not conflict with the
      Rules.

      The Ordinances of a Group may specify:

      1.   how the Ordinances of that Group may be changed, or that
      they may not be changed.  If the Ordinances do not so specify,
      then the Ordinances shall be changed only upon unanimous
      agreement of all Members of that Group.

      2.  the Vizier of the Group, so long as the Vizier is a Member
      of that Group.  If the Ordinances of a Group do not so specify,
      the Vizier shall be the Player whose Application for that Group
      was received first by the Registrar, if e is still a Member of
      that Group.

      3.  the Ordinancekeepor of the Group, so long as the
      Ordinancekeepor is a Member of that Group.  If the Ordinances do
      not so specify, then the Vizier of that Group shall also be its
      Ordinancekeepor.

      4.  How the Points or Currencies in the Group's Treasury shall
      be spent, so long as it does not conflict with the Rules.  A
      Group may spend Points or Currencies in the same manner as a
      Player.  When Points or Currencies are to be spent from the
      Group's Treasury, the Vizier of that Group shall inform the
      Scorekeepor or Recordkeepor for the Currency, as is appropriate.

========================================

Rule 724 (Mutable)
Winning the Game

724.  Requirements for Winning

      The Winner is the first Voter to achieve sufficiently many
      Points.  The minimum number of Points required for Player X to
      win is 10*N*(1+G/6), where N is the number of Players currently
      registered in the Game, and G is the number of Games which
      Player X has already won.  If more than one Voter achieves this
      condition simultaneously, then all such Voters win.  When a Game
      ends in this manner:
        - If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the new
          Speaker and the old Speaker becomes a Voter.
        - If there is more than one Winner, the Voter with the highest Point 
          total becomes the new Speaker.  If more than one Voter is
          tied for the highest score, the old Speaker randomly selects
          one of them to become the new Speaker.  The old Speaker
          becomes a voter.
        - All Player's scores are reset to 0.
        - A new Game is begun.  All Rules and Proposals retain the
          status they had at the end of the old Game.

========================================

Rule 725 (Mutable)
Stocks

725.  Timing of Stock point transfer.

      Let there be for each Player one Currency called X Stock,
      where X is the name of the Player.

      On Friday Noon GMT 5% of the Points of Player X (with a minimum
      of two Points) shall be transfered to the Player (or Players)
      who holds Stock X.

      At the passing of this Proposal the Bank has possession of all
      Stocks.  During the following week the Banker shall collect the
      bids in Marks.  Those bids have to be made by the Players
      (either alone or acting together on the same Stock) in a message
      to the server.  No bid shall be made, which can not be covered
      by the Marks in  he bidders Bank account (to be verified by the
      Banker.)

      After one week each of the Stocks shall be transfered from the
      Bank to the highest bidder. If two or more bids for Stock X are
      exactly equal, the Stock shall go to player X (if one of the
      highest bidders), or to the Player with the lowest score.

      If a given Stock X is bought by Player X, the Marks of the bid
      shall be transfered from Player X to the Bank.
      If a given Stock X is bought by another Player (or Players) then
      Player X, the Marks of the bid shall go from this Player(s) to
      Player X.

      The Banker shall keep track of the Stocks held by each Player.

========================================

Rule 726 (Mutable)
Starting Points and No Unpermitted Point Changes

726.  Initial scores

      All Players begin with 0 Points, except that new Voters who
      enter part-way through a Game in progress shall be given the
      average of the scores of all active Players scores, not
      including those scores, which happen to be negative.
      Points may not be gained, lost, or traded except as explicitly
      stated in the Rules.

========================================

Rule 728 (Mutable)
Destruction of and Compensation for Stocks of Leaving Players

728.  Stocks of leaving Players I

      When Player X leaves the game, Stock X shall be destroyed.
      If Stock X was held at that time by another Player, this Player
      shall be compensated with half the price in Marks that this
      Player paid for the Stock X.
      These Marks shall come from the account of Player X, *before*
      those shall be destroyed, as required by other Rules.
      If there are not enough Marks available, the deficit shall be
      paid by the Bank.
      This Rule applies to the Stock of Players that have left the
      game before adoption of this Proposal.

Rule 730 (Mutable)
Auction for Stocks Owned by Leaving Players

730.  Stocks of leaving Players II

      When a Player leaves the game, any Stock they own shall be sold

      The proceedings shall go to the Bank.

Rule 731 (Mutable)
Creation of and Auction for Stocks of New Players

731.  Stocks of new Players

      When there exists no Stock for Player X, one shall be created
      and sold for Marks in an Auction, with the Banker as Auctioneer.
      The proceedings shall go to Player X, unless they obtain their
      own Stock, in which case the proceedings shall go to the Bank.

========================================

Rule 733 (Mutable)
Default Rules for Officers

733.  Default Rules for Officers

      An Official is any Player who has been Appointed or Elected to
      an Office specified in the Rules. A Judge is not an Officer.
      An Officer may be replaced by another Player, by a Proposal
      stating so, and that Proposal passes.
      An Officer may resign at any time, provided e appoints a
      successor.
      If an Officer resigns while a Proposal is being voted upon to
      replace eim, the Player proposed will by eis Successor.
      This Rule applies to general Offices, and therefore defers to
      Rules for specific Offices.
      Running for office

========================================

Rule 736 (Mutable)
The Marxist

736.  The Marxist

      Let there be the Patent Title known as "Marxist", which is
      awarded to the Player with the most Marks, or if tied, to the
      Players with the most Marks. Only the current richest Player
      or Players may hold this title.

      The determination and announcement of assignment and revoking
      of the Title is made by the Banker, who must use the most
      accurate means of determining this available to eim, and must
      make the announcement as soon as possible after becoming aware
      of a change in holder of the Title.

      However: To respect some Players' wish for privacy, and in
      view of the secret nature of Marks accounts, a prospective
      Marxist must first be asked if e wants the Title. If not, then
      instead of announcing, "Player x is granted the Patent Title of
      'Marxist', e announces, "Patent Title of 'Marxist' is granted

Rule 747 (Mutable)
Definition of a Conserved Quantity

747.  Definition of a Conserved Quantity

      An Entity is only a Conserved Quantity if a Rule explicitly
      states such. A Conserved Quantity may only be Created or
      Destroyed as explicitly stated by the Rules. If a Conserved
      Quantity is given to an Entity, and no Rule states where that
      Conserved Quantity is to be taken from, then the transfer shall
      not take place. If a Conserved Quantity is taken from an Entity,

      transfered to, then the Conserved Quantity shall be transfered
      to the Bank.

      forum stating what  Nomic entity is up for Auction, and that e
      is accepting bids.
 
      Players who wish to participate in the Auction then must
      indicate their interest by sending a bid to the Auctioneer.

Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal

761.  Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal: Adjusting for Abstentions

      When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the Votes which
      have been legally cast shall be counted by the Speaker. If a
      Proposal is not Contested, and there are more FOR votes cast
      then AGAINST votes, then that Proposal shall take effect.  If
      such a Proposal has an equal number of FOR and AGAINST Votes,
      then the Speaker shall decide whether the Proposal shall be
      Adopted, or if that Proposal shall fail. If the Proposal is
      Contested, and the number of FOR votes cast is at least twice
      the number of AGAINST votes cast, then that Proposal shall take
      effect.

      If a Rule will change the actions required of or forbidden to
      the Speaker, and the Speaker opposed the Proposal, then that
      Proposal shall be considered Contested. The Speaker shall
      declare if e opposes the Proposal when e distributes the
      Proposal.

      Treasury as specified in the Y Ordinances.  If the Y Ordinances
      are silent on this issue, or if Group Y has ceased to exist,
      then 1/N times the contents of the Y Treasury, rounded
      downwards, shall be transferred to Player X, where N is the
      number of Members of Group Y immediately before Player X ceased
      to be a Member of Group Y.  This transfer is not taxable, and

Rule 764 (Mutable)
Mischief

764.  Mischief

      Any Player or Group X may perform an Act of Mischief directed
      at any Player or Group Y.  The permissible forms of Mischief
      are defined in other Rules; such definitions must include a 
      positive Price in Coins, or the form of Mischief is not
      permissible.  This Rule explicitly takes precedence over all
      other Rules which purport to determine which forms of Mischief
      are permissible.

      To cause an Act of Mischief,  X  sends to the Public Forum a
      message containing:
      - the Name of the object, Y;
      - the effect of the Act of Mischief;
      - the Number of the Rule which permits the form of Mischief;
      - indication of which Coins in X's account will be used as
      payment for the Act of Mischief.  Coins of Group Y, or the
      Group to which Player Y belongs, may not be used as payment.  

      The effect of the Act of Mischief is applied immediately upon 
      publication of the above message in the Forum.  An additional
      effect of this Act of Mischief is that
      - for each Coin of Group Z spent as payment above, two Points
      are removed from the Z Treasury;
      - the Coins used as payment above are removed from X's account
      and destroyed.

Rule 766 (Mutable)
Groups

766.  Amend Rule 714.

      A Group is initially formed by a set of Players which has
      registered with the Registrar to form a Group; other Players may
      join later.  Each Group has a Name, a Membership, a Vizier,
      an Ordinancekeepor, a Treasury, an Initial Set of Ordinances,
      and an associated form of Currency, called the <name> Coins,
      where <name> is the Name of the Group.

      1.  The Name may not be the Name of another Group.

      2.  The Membership is a set of Players;  these Players are
      Members of the Group, and all other Players are not.

      3.  Synchronously with the registration of a Group, two Offices
      are created known as the <name> Vizier, and the <name>
      Ordinancekeepor, where <name> is the Name of the Group.
      These Offices may never be empty, and the <name> Vizier and
      <name> Ordinancekeepor must both be a member of <name> Group.
      The <name> Vizier shall inform the Registrar whenever the
      Membership or the Ordinancekeepor of the <name> group changes.
      When the <name> Vizier changes, the new Vizier shall inform the
      Registrar of the change.
      The <name> Ordinancekeepor shall keep an accurate and current
      record of the Ordinances of the <name> Group.

      4.  The Treasury is a repository for Points and Currencies and
      has the same capabilities for holding, trading, and spending
      Points and Currencies as does a Player.

      5.  The Ordinances are a description of the operation of the
      Group.

      6.  The <name> Coins are a form of Currency which is created
      synchronously with the registration of the Group.  The <name>
      Group may create <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be
      placed in the <name> Treasury.  The <name> Group may destroy
      <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be removed from the
      <name> Treasury.

Votes for Groups

      If a Group has N Members then it has N Votes for each
      Proposal in addition to those of its Membership.  The
      Ordinances of a Group may determine how and when the Group
      casts its Votes; if the Ordinances are silent on this issue
      then the Group may not cast its Votes.  The Votes of the
      Group are cast when the Vizier sends a message to the Speaker
      to that effect during the Voting Period and this action is

      When a Player submits a Proposal, e may pay one Mark to the Bank
      (if e has at least one Mark) and impose Sanity on that Proposal.
      E must inform both the Banker and the Speaker when doing so.
      A Proposal which has Sanity imposed upon it is known as a Sane
      Proposal.  The Speaker shall, when e distributes a Sane
      Proposal, inform the Players that it is a Sane Proposal.

      No non-Voter Nomic entity may Vote on a Sane Proposal.  Each
      Voter shall have exactly one Vote on a Sane Proposal, and
      each Voter's Vote shall be counted exactly once on a Sane
      Proposal.

      This rule takes precedence over any rule allowing a non-Voter
      Nomic entity to Vote; over any rule which gives any Voter
      more or less than one Vote on a proposal; and over any
      rule which would cause any Voter's Vote to be counted more or
      less than once.

      acted or has failed to act in such a way as to be in violation
      of one or more Rules, and this CFJ is Judged TRUE, then the
      Judge must issue an Injunction that the Ninny submit a Formal
      Apology.  This Injunction may also include a list of up to ten
      Prescribed Words.  By a Formal Apology is meant a letter of at
      least 200 words, containing all of the Prescribed Words,
      explaining the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
      for self-improvement, and posted in the Public Forum.  Within 48
      hours of the posting of this Formal Apology, the Squealer must
      either submit a Proposal that the Ninny's Apology be accepted,
      or submit a Proposal that the Ninny's Aplology be rejected,
      but not both.  No other Player may submit such a Proposal, and
      the Squealer may submit only one.  If a Proposal to accept the
      Apology fails, or if a Proposal to reject the Apology passes,
      then the Ninny loses 5 Points.

Rule 785 (Mutable)
Abandonment of Speakerhood

785.  Improve Speaker Succession I

      If the Speaker has abandoned eir post, another new, Temporary
      Speaker is selected according to the "Rules of Succession", or
      if no such rules are defined, the other Player not on hold with
      the highest Score becomes the temporary Speaker.  This does not
      force the Game to be over in this case, and Scores are not reset
      to 0. The Game continues until a Player Wins, at which time a
      new Game is begun and the Winner becomes the real Speaker. The
      Temporary Speaker shall make reasonable effort to obtain the
      former Speaker's materials: proposal queue, voting records, etc.
      but if this is not possible, then the Temporary Speaker shall
      request that these be resubmitted by the Players. If a Speaker
      is replaced in this manner, e has eir score set to minus 2N
      Points immediately, where N is the number of Points required for
      a Player to Win the Game.

      Abandonment is determined as follows: If any Player suspects
      that the Speaker has Abandoned, e sends a message to all Players
      calling on the Speaker to announce eir presence.  The Speaker
      must reply to all Players within one week; if e does not, e is

      within three days of the Abandonment or resignation of the
      Speaker.  The old Speaker may not send such a message.  This

      voluntarily giving up his position; or to the first Player who
      called for the Speaker to announce his presence, in the case of

      interpreted in a certain way, e shall also submit a list of
      Rules relevant to that CFJ, which must include the Rule in
      question.  If the statement is Judged TRUE, the Judge may
      include with the Judgement an Injuction requiring the Rulekeepor
      to annotate the Rule in question with the Statement in the CFJ
      and the list of relevant Rules.

      The annotation shall remain only until one of the Rules
      in the list of relevant Rules is amended, repealed, or
      transmuted; or until a CFJ determines that the injunction no
      longer applies, as described below.  While it remains, it shall
      guide the application of that Rule.

      If a Player believes that the circumstances which led to the
      Judgement no longer prevail and the annotation is therefore no
      longer applicable, e may submit a CFJ to that effect. If it is

      closed. As soon as this notification appears on the Public
      Forum, Players are prohibited from submitting any more
      Proposals, and the Speaker shall refuse to accept any which are
      inadvertently submitted.

      When the number of Proposals up for Vote has dropped to PL/2 or

      This Rule applies to Offices in general, and defers to the Rules
      for specific Offices.

========================================

Rule 807 (Mutable)
Non-Rule-Change Proposals

807.  Non-Rule-Change Proposals

      Proposals may be made which do not contain Rule Changes.  The
      permissible forms of Non-Rule-Change Proposals (or NRC
      Proposals), and the Declarations needed to propose them, shall
      be defined in other legislation.

      NRC Proposals are Voted upon and treated exactly like other
      Proposals, and shall be Numbered exactly like other Proposals.

Rule 822 (Mutable)
No Coercive Proposals

822.  Stop the Insanity

      Proposals whose obvious and direct intent is to coerce a Player
      into voting against eir conscience are disallowed. For the
      purpose of Rule 106 or its successors, such a proposal is

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which would
      otherwise allow such a shameful Proposal to be voted on.

823.  Marks Conversions

      At the end of each game let each Player that did not win have

      votes or activities before the passage of said Proposal only if
      said Proposal was passed unanimously.

      For the purpose of this Rule, Proposals that are passed without 
      receiving any AGAINST votes are considered to be unanimous.

========================================

Rule 833 (Mutable)
Reward or Penalty for Proposing

833.  Reward Successful Proposals

      When the voting period for a proposal is over, the proposer gets
      F-A points, where F is the number of votes FOR, and A is the

      shall be counted for this determination.
      (*Was: 544*)

========================================

Rule 839 (Mutable)
Office of the Assistant

839.  Office of the Assistant

      Let there be an Office of the Assistant.  Said Office shall be

      regarding commuication with Players on Hold.

========================================

Rule 840 (Mutable)
The Scamster

840.  The Scamster

      Let there be a Patent Title known as the "Scamster". This is
      awarded to a Player who has shown great enthusiasm, persistence,
      or skill in the perpretating of Scams. This title is awarded by
      Proposal and once awarded is permanent.

      A Scamster must pay a one-time fee of 1 Point to the Point
      Reserve upon receiving the Title. This fee is not optional, and
      the Patent Title may not be declined.

========================================

Rule 842 (Mutable)
Most Titled

842.  The Most Titled Player

      Let there be a Patent Title known as "Most Titled". This Title

      this and announcing when the Most Titled Player changes.

Here are the new ones...

====================
PROPOSAL 863 (Stella?)

Revenge Waggie!
(Appeal by Proposal)

The Judgment on CFJ ??? (the Walrus question, Judge: the
Honorable Chuck) shall be overturned from FALSE into TRUE.

====

Proposal 864 (KoJen) 

Destroy the Walrus Marks
(Creates a new rule)

Any Marks created through the passage of the Walrus Rules (Rules 818 and 819)
shall be destroyed.  If any of these Marks have been converted into points,
those points earned shall be returned to the Point Reserve.

===

PROPOSAL 865 (KoJen)

Incentive For Proto-Proposing
(creates a rule)

Players are urged to "proto-Propose" an idea before submitting it as
an official Proposal. This is done be posting the complete Proposal as
it would be submitted, to the Public Forum, adding the prefix "proto-"
to the word "PROPOSAL", at least one Week and no more than four Weeks
before the Proposal is submitted to the Speaker. The submitter is
encouraged but not required to take into account suggestions by the
Nomic community, and modify the proto-proposal before submitting as an
official Proposal. When proposed in this manner, the Proposer receives
2 Points. The Speaker must mention this payment when e distributes the
Proposal. 

To be eligible for this, the submitter must indicate to the Speaker
when the Proposal was proto-Proposed, and what changes were
incorporated. A Proposal must be a "reasonably plausible evolution" of
its proto-Proposal or this credit does not apply. In case of a
violation, the submitter, and not the Speaker shall be the Guilty
Party.

[Justification: This should improve the quality of Proposals somewhat
by encouraging discussion.]

===

PROPOSAL 866 (KoJen)
Incentive For Proto-Proposing to Group
(creates a rule)

Players are urged to "proto-Propose" an idea before submitting it as
an official Proposal. Should the Proposer desire, e may decide to
proto-Propose it to eir own Group rather than to the Public
Forum. This is done by Posting the complete Proposal as it would be
submitted, to all Active members of eir Group, adding the prefix
"proto-" to the word "PROPOSAL", at least one Week and no more then
four Weeks before the Proposal is submitted to the Speaker. The
submitter is encouraged but not required to take into account
suggestions by the Group members, and modify the proto-proposal before
submitting as an official Proposal. When proposed in this manner, the
Proposer receives 2 Points. The Speaker must mention this payment when
e distributes the Proposal.

To be eligible for this, the submitter must indicate to the Speaker
when and to whom the Proposal was proto-Proposed, and what changes
were incorporated. A Proposal must be a "reasonably plausible
evolution" of its proto-Proposal or this credit does not apply. In
case of a violation, the submitter, and not the Speaker shall be the
Guilty Party.

[Justification: This should improve the quality of Proposals somewhat
by encouraging discussion.]

=====

PROPOSAL 867 (KoJen)

Conflicting Proposals
(creates a rule)

If there is currently a distributed Proposal X, or a submitted but
not-yet-distributed Proposal-to-be X, whose effect includes the
amending or repeal of Rule Y, then no additional Proposals whose
effect includes the amending or repeal of the same Rule Y shall be
accepted until the outcome of Proposal X is decided. Responsibility of
enforcing this is given to the Speaker, who shall return such
submissions to the sender, as they are not properly made proposals.

[Justification: To prevent confusion and frustration, and time-wasting
from simultaneous Proposals which conflict with one another, possibly
jeapordizing the passage of both of them. Give each Proposal a fair
chance before allowing the next to be up for vote.]

====

PROPOSAL 868 (Vlad)

(Creates a Rule)

Patent Titles for the Masses

  Each Player may purchase one (1) Patent Title, of
no more than 15 Characters in length, by expending
10 Points and posting a message to the Public Forum
declaring the Patent Title so purchased.
  The Registrar shall recieve 3 Points from each such
transaction.
  A Patent Title so purchased may be changed by the
repetition of this process.

=====================

Proposal 869 (Garth)

Registered Players
(Amends a Rule)

Rule 498 is Amended in its entirety to read:

"A Player is any person who is registered as a Player.  No person
may be registered as a Player more than once concurrently."

[ This makes way in the future for Rules that permit non-Players
(or even semi-Players, or different ranks) to affect the Game.
There is not much effect on the Rules now, as the Rules generally
refer to Players.  I came up with this when people kept pointing
out that Steve, etc., *might* (I disagree) be causing us to break
the Rules by listening to them.  Also, someone pointed out that
any Foreign Policy (even just trade) will require this Rule to be
amended.  Why not do it now? ]

==========================

Proposal 870 (Garth)

Putting Oneself On Hold
(Amends a Rule)

The second paragraph of Rule 464 is amended in its entirety
to read:

"While On Hold, a Player may not Vote, propose Proposals,
or campaign for or hold Office.  E is also absolved of any
duties which would otherwise be required of eim, including
appointment as a Judge."

[ This will permit Players On Hold to communicate with us,
something that everyone seems to feel is stupid, but which
noone has yet Proposed. ]

=========================

Proposal 871 (Garth)

Keep Jeffrey S.!
(Run for Office)

Let Jeffrey S. be the Clerk of the Courts.

[ I don't want to see our esteemed Clerk resign under a cloud.
I think he has done quite a good job.  I, like Chuck, disagree
with the withdrawal of 826, but I do not feel this is a valid
reason to impugn anyone's honesty and integrity.

Don't get me wrong, I am not saying that Chuck would make a bad
CotC, he'd probably make quite a good one, but there is a principle
to be upheld.  Vote FOR, and keep Jeffrey S. as our CotC! ]

=========================

Proposal 872 (Garth)

Semimutable Rules
(Creates a Rule)

Let there be a class of Mutable Rules known as Semimutable Rules.
Semimutable Rules may only be Amended or Repealed if a Proposal to do
so receives at least four times as many FOR Votes as AGAINST Votes.
All Semimutable Rules shall be marked as such in any copies of the
Ruleset mandated by the Rules.

Any Immutable Rule that is Transmuted to Mutable shall automatically
be Semimutable.

Rules may be made Semimutable (or non-Semimutable) by Proposal.
Removing Semimutability in this way requires at least four times as
many FOR Votes as AGAINST Votes. 

This Rule is Semimutable.  Upon being Adopted, this Rule's Number
shall be changed to 200.  Upon being Amended, this Rule's Number
shall likewise be changed to 200.

This Rule takes precedence over all other Rules governing the number
of Votes needed to Adopt Proposals.

======================

Proposal 873 (Garth)

Automatic Semimutability
(Creates a Rule)

Let all Rules Adopted that receive at least four times as many FOR
Votes as AGAINST Votes automatically be Semimutable, unless the Rule
explicitly states otherwise.

This Rule is Semimutable.

===========================

Proposal 874 (Garth)

Withdrawing Proposals
(Creates a Rule)

If a Player informs the Speaker at least one day before the end of
the Voting Period that e wishes to Withdraw a Proposal that was
submitted by eim, no further Votes on that Proposal shall be 
accepted.  All existing Votes on that Proposal shall be changed to
ABSTAIN, and shall not count as Votes for purposes other than 
determining whether the Proposal in question passed.

Upon Withdrawing the Proposal, the Player shall lose three Points,
or five Points if the Proposal had not previously been discussed
in the Public Forum before being submitted.  These Points shall be
given to the Speaker, unless the Speaker is making the Withdrawal,
in which case they shall be placed in the Point Reserve.  Further,
the Player shall compensate any other Players who placed Points in
the Vototron for that Proposal.

This Rule takes precedence over other Rules governing Votes and
Voting.

===========================

Proposal 875 (Garth)

Group Proposals
(Creates a Rule)

A Group as a whole may make Proposals.  Such Proposals are submitted
by the Group's Vizier, and are treated precisely as Proposals submitted
by Players, except that they do not count toward any Proposal limits or
quotas.

At most one such Group Proposal per Group may be submitted per Nomic
Week;  Group Proposals shall only be made as explicitly permitted in
the Group Ordinances.  A Group shall automatically cast its Votes FOR
its own Group Proposals.

After the Voting Period, a Group that submitted a Group Proposal shall
receive 2 * (F-A) Points from the Point Reserve, where F is the number
of Votes cast FOR the Group Proposal, and A is the number of Votes cast
AGAINST it; unless F-A is negative, in which case it shall lose 2 * (A-F)
Points to the Point Reserve.  The Points shall be placed in (or removed
from, as the case may be) the Group's Treasury.

This Rule takes precedence over any Rule defining a Proposal limit or
quota.

[ Gives Groups a chance to officially define themselves.  State their
platforms in actions, so to speak.  And a Group that can charm other
Groups into going along is rewarded, just as Players are.  Plus, there
are other uses for Group Proposals.  Read on! ]

=======================

Proposal 876 (Garth)

Group War
(Creates a Rule)

A Group (known as the Aggressor) may Declare War upon another Group
(known as the Victim).  The Aggressor may make such a Declaration
only as explicitly permitted in its Ordinances.  A Declaration of
War is announced by the Aggressor's Vizier to the Public Forum,
with an account as well of the Reasons for the Declaration.

While at War, all Points won or lost by the Aggressor for its Group
Proposals shall be transferred from (or to, as the case may be) the
Victim's Treasury rather than the Point Reserve.  Further, the
Aggressor shall receive one Point from the Victim's Treasury for
each Proposal of its Members that is Adopted.

A War ends if there are zero Points or less left in either the
Aggressor or the Victim's Treasuries, or as provided in other Rules.
If the Aggressor's Treasury is depleted, the Victim has Won, and
each Member of the Aggressor must make a Formal Apology (as defined
in other Rules), using the Prescribed Words chosen by the Victim's
Vizier.  If the Victim's Treasury is depleted, the Aggressor has
Won, and the Victim shall lose one of its Votes for two Nomic Weeks,
while the Aggressor shall gain an extra Vote for two Nomic Weeks.

After a War is Won, the losing side may not have War Declared on it
for two Nomic Weeks, unless it forfeits that protection by Declaring
War itself.

This Rule takes precedence over other Rules governing Group Proposals
and Group Votes.

[ If you think this is totally silly and frivolous, you're ALMOST right.
Note that the way to win a War is to make good Proposals.  Well, anyway,
Proposals that pass.  So it encourages good play, as well as being a
great deal of fun!  The ban on War for two weeks after a loss is intended
to prevent a Group from being wiped out.  Note:  I created this after 
someone complained that there wasn't enough interaction between Groups.
You have only yourselves to blame!  :) ]

=========================

Proposal 877 (Garth)

Ending a War by Mutual Agreement
(Creates a Rule)

A War may be ended prematurely if the two sides agree to an
Armistice.  An Armistice is a binding agreement between the two
Groups, containing whatever terms they agree upon.  Armistices
must be published to the Public Forum and confirmed by the Viziers
of the two Groups in order to be binding.  Armistices may only be
negotiated, agreed upon, and confirmed as stipulated in the Groups'
Ordinances.  If the Ordinances are silent on this matter, no 
Armistice may be concluded.  Violation of an Armistice shall be a
Class C Crime, and shall further be a violation of this Rule.

No Armistice may require any Player or Nomic Entity to violate the
Rules or commit Crimes.  Any Armistice purporting to require such
shall be null and void.

If both of the two Groups have Declared War on each other, only a
single Armistice is needed to end both Wars.

[ This gives another way out of a War besides fighting to the bitter
end.  It encourages diplomacy, sneaky wording, sliminess and back-
stabbing.  In other words, the stuff that Nomic is all about! :) ]

THE CURRENT RULESET
Part 1 of 5 

Rules are listed as follows, where NNN represents the Rule number:

========================================

Rule NNN (Immutable or Mutable)
My Own Unofficial Title

NNN.  Semi-Official Rule Title, If There Is One

      Text of Rule

[Note:  I have annotated some Rules to clarify their interpretation.
However, these annotations have no legal force in and of themselves.]

========================================



========================================

Rule 101 (Immutable)
Obey the Rules

101.

      All Players must always abide by all the Rules then in effect,
      in the form in which they are then in effect.  The Rules in the
      Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the first game.
      The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (Immutable) and
      201-219 (Mutable).

========================================

Rule 102 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Rules

102.

      Initially Rules in the 100's are Immutable and Rules in the
      200's are Mutable.  Rules subsequently Enacted or Transmuted
      (that is, changed from Immutable to Mutable or vice versa) may
      be Immutable or Mutable regardless of their Numbers, and Rules
      in the Initial Set may be Transmuted regardless of their Numbers.

========================================

Rule 103 (Immutable)
The Speaker and Voters

103.

      At any time, each Player shall be either a Voter or the Speaker;
      no Player may simultaneously be a Voter and a Speaker. At any
      time, there shall be exactly one Speaker. The term "Player" in
      the Rules shall specifically include both the Voters and the
      Speaker.

========================================

Rule 104 (Immutable)
First Speaker

104.

      The Speaker for the first game shall be Michael Norrish.

========================================

Rule 105 (Immutable)
What Is a Rule Change?

105.

      A Rule Change is any of the following:  (1) the enactment,
      repeal, or amendment of a mutable Rule; or (2) the transmutation
      of an immutable Rule into a mutable Rule or vice versa.
        (Note:  This definition implies that, at least initially, all
      new Rules are Mutable; Immutable Rules, as long as they are
      Immutable, may not be Amended or Repealed; Mutable Rules, as long
      as they are Mutable, may be Amended or Repealed; any Rule of any
      status may be Transmuted; no Rule is absolutely immune to change.)

========================================

Rule 106 (Immutable)
Adopting Proposed Rule Changes

106.

      All Rule Changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on.
      They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required
      number of votes and Quorum is achieved.

========================================

Rule 107 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Must Be Written Down

107.

      Any proposed Rule Change must be written down (or otherwise
      communicated in print media) before it is voted on. If adopted,
      it must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.

========================================

Rule 108 (Immutable)
When May Rule Changes Take Effect?

108.

      No Rule Change may take effect earlier than the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording
      explicitly states otherwise.  No rule change may have retroactive
      application.

========================================

Rule 109 (Immutable)
Rule Numbers

109.

      The Speaker shall give each proposed Rule Change a Number for
      reference.  The numbers shall begin with 301, and each Rule
      Change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next
      successive integer, whether or not the Proposal is adopted.
        If a Rule is Repealed and Reenacted, it receives the Number of
      the Proposal to Reenact it.  If a Rule is Amended or Transmuted,
      it receives the Number of the Proposal to Amend or Transmute it.
 
========================================

Rule 110 (Immutable)
Transmutation of Rules

110.

      Rule Changes that Transmute Immutable Rules into Mutable Rules
      may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among Votes
      legally cast.  Transmutation shall not be implied, but must be
      stated explicitly in a Proposal to take effect.
 
========================================

Rule 111 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Conflicts

111.

      In a conflict between a Mutable and an Immutable Rule, the
      immutable Rule takes precedence and the Mutable Rule shall be
      entirely void.  For the purposes of this Rule a Proposal to
      Transmute an Immutable Rule does not "conflict" with that
      Immutable Rule.
 
========================================

Rule 112 (Immutable)
Winning Must Be by Points

112.

      The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered
      from achieving n points to any other state of affairs.  The
      magnitude of n and the means of earning points may be changed,
      and Rules that establish a Winner when play cannot continue may
      be Enacted and (while they are mutable) be Amended or Repealed.
 
========================================

Rule 113 (Immutable)
Players May Always Forfeit

113.

      A Player always has the option to forfeit the Game rather than
      continue to play or incur a Game penalty.  No penalty worse than
      losing, in the judgment of the Player to incur it, may be
      imposed.

========================================

Rule 114 (Immutable)
At Least One Mutable Rule

114.

      There must always be at least one Mutable Rule.  The adoption of
      Rule Changes must never become completely inpermissible.

========================================

Rule 115 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Which Change Rule-Changing Rules Allowed

115.

      Rule Changes that affect Rules needed to allow or apply
      Rule Changes are as permissible as other Rule Changes.  Even
      Rule Changes that amend or repeal their own authority are
      permissible.  No Rule Change or type of move is impermissible
      solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a
      Rule.

========================================

Rule 116 (Immutable)
Permissibility of the Unprohibited

116.

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
      and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
      which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly or
      implicitly permits it.

========================================

Rule 201 (Mutable)
Quorum

201.

      Quorum for a proposed Rule Change is defined to be 20% of Voters
      at the beginning of the prescribed Voting Period for that
      Proposal.

========================================

Rule 206 (Mutable)
One Voter, One Vote

206.

      Each Voter has exactly one Vote.  The Speaker may not Vote.

========================================

Rule 208 (Mutable)
End of the Voting Period

208.

      At the end of the prescribed Voting Period on a Proposal, the
      Speaker shall reveal all Votes legally cast on that Proposal. If
      the Speaker's consent may be required for a Proposal to be
      adopted then the Speaker should indicate at that time whether or
      not e gives eir consent.  If the Speaker does not explicitly
      indicate that e refuses to consent to the Proposal, it shall be
      assumed that e consents.

========================================

Rule 212 (Mutable)
Resolving Rule Conflicts

212.

      If two or more Mutable Rules conflict with one another, or if
      two or more Immutable Rules conflict with one another, then the
      Rule with the lowest ordinal Number takes precedence.
        If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of rule) or takes
      precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.
        If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

========================================

Rule 217 (Mutable)
Judgements Must Accord with the Rules

217.

      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however, if
      the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the Statement
      to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider Game Custom and the
      Spirit of the Game before applying other standards.

========================================

Rule 312 (Mutable)
A Point for Voting

312.

      If a Voter votes, he gets one (1) point at the end of the Voting
      Period.

========================================

Rule 376 (Mutable)
When Does a Rule Change Take Effect?

376.  Time that a rule change takes effect:

      An adopted rule change takes full effect at the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it.
      The moment of the completion of the vote is defined by the date
      and time given in the line starting with "Date:" of the Nomic
      listserver message send by the Benevolent Speaker, announcing
      the result of the vote on the corresponding proposal.

========================================

Rule 388 (Mutable)
Game Status When a New Game Begins

388.  Starting a new Game:

      Whenever a new game of Nomic is begun, the status of the new
      Game when it begins shall be the same as the status of the old
      Game when it ended, in all respects where the Rules do not
      decide otherwise.

========================================

Rule 399 (Mutable)
The Office of the Rulekeepor

399.  The Office of the Rulekeepor:

      Let there be an Officer known as the Rulekeepor.
      The Rulekeepor shall maintain a complete list of the current
      Rules, and post this list to all Players at least once a week.
      
      So long as the Rulekeepor is in Office, the Speaker is not
      required to maintain or distribute the Rules.

========================================

Rule 402 (Mutable)
Transfer of Power of the Mighty Speaker

402.  Transfer of Power of the Mighty Speaker:

      When one Mighty Speaker is yielding his Office to another, the
      following procedure shall be followed:
      
       1) The Present Mighty Speaker shall forward copies of all
          necessary materials for the performance of his Office to the
          Prospective Mighty Speaker.
       2) The Prospective Mighty Speaker shall acknowledge the receipt
          of said materials.
       3) The Present Mighty Speaker shall post a message to the
          listserv announcing the official transfer of power, which
          occurs at the "Date:" of the Present Mighty Speaker's
          posting.
      
      The Present Mighty Speaker remains in Office until the successful
      completion of step 3.

========================================

Rule 404 (Mutable)
Legality of Proposals

404.  Legality of Proposals:

      As long as a Proposal satisfies all requirements in place at the
      time of its making for the proper making of Proposals, the act
      of making such a Proposal is legal regardless of its content.
      It is legal to propose a Rule which conflicts with other Rules
      or with itself, which is paradoxical, or which cannot be
      applied.

========================================

Rule 405 (Mutable)
No Vacations for Officers

405.  No Vacations for Officers:

      No Officer may be 'On Hold' while holding an Office.  If a
      current Officer should place himself On Hold, he is assumed to
      have resigned without appointing a successor, and the Office
      should be re-filled in the normal manner.  This Rule takes
      precedence over Rule 386.

========================================

Rule 406 (Mutable)
Clerk of the Courts

406.  Clerk of the Courts, Part I: Definition of Office:

      There shall exist an Office "Clerk of the Courts", who shall
      have general responsibility over administering Calls for
      Judgement, as outlined in the Rules.  The active Clerk of the
      Court may never be selected as a Judge.

      As a salary for carrying out his duties, he will receive 5
      points at the end of every seven days he is in Office, counting
      from his assumption of the Office.

      The initial holder of this Office shall be the Player who
      submitted this Proposal.

========================================

Rule 407 (Mutable)
Invoking Judgement

407.  Clerk of the Courts, Part II: Invoking Judgement:

      If Players disagree about the legality of a Move or the
      interpretation or application of a Rule, then a Player may
      invoke Judgement by submitting a Statement for Judgement to the
      Clerk of the Courts.  Disagreement, for the purposes of this
      Rule, may be created by the insistence of any Player.  When
      Judgement is invoked, the Clerk of the Courts must, as soon as
      possible, select a Judge as described in the Rules.  The Clerk
      of the Courts must then distribute the Statement to be judged,
      along with the identity of the Judge, to all Players.

========================================

Rule 408 (Mutable)
Accepting Judge-ship

408.  Clerk of the Courts, Part III: Accepting Judge-ship:

      After the Clerk of the Courts has distributed the Statement to
      be judged and the identity of the Judge, the Judge has one week
      in which to deliver a legal Judgement.  If the Judge fails to
      deliver a Judgement within this time, e is penalized 10 points
      and a new Judge is selected.  A Judgement is delivered by
      submitting that Judgement to the Clerk of the Courts, who must
      then distribute that Judgement to all Players as soon as
      possible.

========================================

Rule 413 (Mutable)
Winning by Paradox

413.  Winning By Paradox:

      If the Rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or
      if the legality of some action cannot be determined with
      finality, or if some action appears equally legal and illegal,
      then a player may Call For Judgement on a Statement to that
      effect.  If the Statement is judged TRUE, then the same Judge
      who judged the Statement TRUE must declare the most recent
      passed Proposal X such that the Statement was not TRUE before
      the passage of Proposal X, or declare that there is no such
      Proposal.  (Until the Judge does this, the Judgment is not
      valid.)  If the Judgement of TRUE is not overruled, then the
      Player who called for Judgement is declared the Winner of the
      game.
      
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared that
      there is no such Proposal X, the game is ended, with no
      provisions for restarting it.
      
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared such
      a Proposal X, the following actions are taken:
         - all Players remain active,
         - all Proposals curently being Voted upon are removed from
           consideration for Voting,
         - the scores for all Players are set to 0 (zero),
         - the Rules and explicit game custom are reverted to the
           state they were in before Proposal X was passed,
         - a Benevolent Speaker for the next Game is chosen:
              -If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the
               Benevolent Speaker, and the old Benevolent Speaker
               becomes a Voter,
              -If there is more than one Winner, the Benevolent
               Speaker randomly selects one of the Winners, who
               becomes the new Benevolent Speaker, and the old
               Benevolent Speaker becomes a Voter,
         - and a new Game is begun.

========================================

Rule 415 (Mutable)
How To Submit a Proposal

415.  "How a Proposal is Submitted":

      A Proposal by a Voter shall be made by submitting it to the
      Mighty Speaker. As soon as possible after receiving the
      Proposal, the Mighty Speaker shall assign the Proposal a Number
      and distribute the Proposal along with its number to all
      Players.
      
      The Mighty Speaker may also make Proposals. The Mighty Speaker
      must process all pending Voter-submitted Proposals first, and
      may then Process Proposals of the Mighty Speaker, assigning
      these Proposals a number and distributing them in the same
      fashion as any other Proposal.

========================================

Rule 417 (Mutable)
The Nomic Archivist

417.  Establishment of the Office of Archivist:

      That there be established an office known as the Nomic
      Archivist, which shall be governed by the default Rules
      concerning official posts. The initial duties of the Nomic
      Archivist shall be to record the passage and failure of
      Proposals, to maintain a "historical record" (defined below)
      of the Ruleset, to maintain a list of Judgements and their case
      histories, and to maintain a list of game Winners in past games.
      The Archivist is free to comment on the historical records as
      they see fit, but such commentary must be clearly delimited
      from the historical material. Where the material being stored
      does not already admit a classification method, the Archivist
      is free to design one themselves.

      The "historical record" of the Ruleset maintained by the
      Archivist is one that includes all rules ever part of the nomic
      Ruleset, annotated with information as to their ultimate fate,
      whether Repealed or Amended etc. This record of the Ruleset has
      no legal force.

      The duties required of the Archivist may be changed with their
      consent and at the request of the Office's controlling body
      (whatsoever that may be). Initially, the controlling body of
      this Office shall be all Players, and any request to change the
      duties must therefore be supported by a majority of Players
      "speaking" to the request.  Naturally, default Rules for
      Offices may establish a different controlling body for this
      Office.
      
      The salary of the Archivist office shall be determined by its
      controlling body. Initially, its salary shall be 5 points and
      one coin of the office-holder's group per week.
      
      The initial office-holder for this post shall be Michael
      Norrish.

========================================

Rule 434 (Mutable)
Game May Be Won By CFJ

434.  Judgement Required to Win (and Timing of Win):

      If a Player believes that he has won the Game, he may submit a
      CFJ to that effect.  If it is returned with the Judgement TRUE
      (and that Judgement is not Appealed), then he has won the Game
      as of the delivery of that Judgement.  If the Judgement is TRUE,
      but is Appealed, but is sustained (and no Proposal to reverse
      the verdict is made), then he has won the Game as of the
      delivery of the Appeal verdict.  If such a verdict is sustained,
      challenged by Proposal, but the Proposal does not pass, he has
      won the Game as of the completion of the Vote on that Proposal.

      Judgement on a CFJ to win the Game may *not* be delivered until
      at least 72 hours after its official announcement, in order to
      give time for the Judge to accept input from the community.

      This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which specifies
      the exact moment at which a Game is won.

[Note: Implicit Game Custom dictates that, despite the title,
this rule does not *require* a CFJ in order to win the game.]

========================================

Rule 450 (Mutable)
Game Entities May Not Be Arbitrarily Changed

450.  Game Entities may not be Arbitrarily Changed:

      Any Entity which is created by the Nomic Rules, and which exists only
      within the context of the current Game of Nomic, such as Points,
      Votes, etc. may *not* be changed by any action other than those
      specified by the Rules.

========================================

Rule 451 (Mutable)
Determination of Judgement--Timing

451.  Timing of CFJ Results:

      When a CFJ makes a Statement about the current state of the
      Game, the result of that CFJ shall be TRUE if and only if the
      Judge feels that that Statement was correct at the time that the
      CFJ was *issued*. Any changes that have happened in the time
      between the issuing of the CFJ and its delivery must be figured
      in to find the correct current state.

========================================

Rule 452 (Mutable)
Prohibition of Electioneering by the Mighty Speaker

452.  Prohibition of Electioneering by the Mighty Speaker:

      The Speaker may not use eis knowledge of the current status of a
      vote on a Proposal in an attempt to influence the result of the
      Vote on that Proposal. Violations of this Rule shall be
      considered a Class C Crime.

========================================

Rule 454 (Mutable)
Declaring Proposals

454.  Clarity of Proposals:

      All Proposals must declare what effect that Proposal will have
      on the Rule Set. If said Proposal has a Title, this Declaration
      shall appear on the line immediately below that Title. In any
      case, the Declaration shall appear in parentheses. The
      Declarations shall be as follows:

         (Creates a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes a new
            Rule to come into existance.
         (Amends a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes an
            existing Rule to change wording or form.
         (Repeals a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes an
            existing Rule to cease to exist.
         (Transmutes a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes a
            Mutable Rule to become Immutable, or vice versa.
         (Other) shall be used if no other Declaration has been
            defined which describes the Proposal.

      Additional legislation may define additional legal Declarations
      or change the presentation of the Declaration, but this Rule
      shall take precedence in all other cases.

========================================

Rule 455 (Mutable)
Penalty for Improper or Lacking Declarations

455.  Further Declaration Rules:

      Any Player who submits a Proposal which does not include a
      Declaration, as described in other legislation, shall be guilty
      of a Class C Crime.  Any Player who submits a Proposal which
      includes a Declaration which has not been approved by
      legislation shall be guilty of a Class A Crime.

========================================

Rule 457 (Mutable)
Voting of the ex-Speaker

457.  Voting of the ex-Speaker:

      If a Player ceases to be the Speaker, and then becomes a Voter,
      that Player may not Vote on any Proposal whose Voting Period
      began while that Player was still the Speaker. This Rule takes
      precedence over any other Rule which indicates who may or may
      not Vote.

========================================

Rule 459 (Mutable)

459.  The Nomic Week

      The Nomic Week begins at midnight, GMT, each Monday. Any

663.  General Rules For Injunctions

      There shall be an entity known as an Injunction, which may
      accompany certain Judgements of TRUE or FALSE as provided in the
      rules. An Injunction is a statement or series of statements
      specifying an action or actions which must take place. If a
      Judgement is is accompanied by an Injunction, that Injunction
      must be published with the Judgement. All players must abide by
      the Injunction beginning no later than 72 hours after its
      publication unless one of the following conditions then apply:
        - The Judgement which the Injunction accompanies is undergoing
          appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of the appeal
          process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but a proposal
          has been published which would overturn that decision if
          passed, and said proposal has not failed.
        - The validity of the Injunction itself is questioned by a
          pending CFJ.
        - A Judgement upholding the validity of the Injunction is
          undergoing appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of
          the appeal process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but
          a proposal has been published which would overturn that
          decision if passed, and said proposal has not failed.

      A Judgement may not be accompanied by an Injunction unless it is
      specifically permitted elsewhere in the rules. An Injunction
      must be completely consistent with all rules in effect at the
      time of issuance, and must be completely relevant to the matter
      addressed in the corresponding judgement.

      If any Player believes that an Injunction or any part of it does
      not meet the criteria for a valid Injunction, e may submit a CFJ
      to that effect. If the resulting Judgement supports the
      contention that the criteria are not met, the Injunction shall
      be considered illegal and shall have no legal force.

      This rule takes precedence over all rules governing Injunctions.

========================================

Rule 664 (Mutable)

      the Judgement an Injunction specifying that the move is to be
      retracted, and any resulting adjustments to the published game
      state. The adjustments to the game state must have been
      unambiguously specified within the CFJ, and these adjustments
      must only undo actions which were a direct or indirect result of
      that Move.

Rule 724 (Mutable)
Winning the Game

724.  Requirements for Winning

      The Winner is the first Voter to achieve sufficiently many
      Points.  The minimum number of Points required for Player X to
      win is 10*N*(1+G/6), where N is the number of Players currently
      registered in the Game, and G is the number of Games which
      Player X has already won.  If more than one Voter achieves this
      condition simultaneously, then all such Voters win.  When a Game

        - If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the new
          Speaker and the old Speaker becomes a Voter.
        - If there is more than one Winner, the Voter with the highest Point 
          total becomes the new Speaker.  If more than one Voter is
          tied for the highest score, the old Speaker randomly selects
          one of them to become the new Speaker.  The old Speaker
          becomes a voter.
        - All Player's scores are reset to 0.
        - A new Game is begun.  All Rules and Proposals retain the
          status they had at the end of the old Game.

      of two Points) shall be transfered to the Player (or Players)
      who holds Stock X.

      At the passing of this Proposal the Bank has possession of all
      Stocks.  During the following week the Banker shall collect the
      bids in Marks.  Those bids have to be made by the Players
      (either alone or acting together on the same Stock) in a message
      to the server.  No bid shall be made, which can not be covered
      by the Marks in  he bidders Bank account (to be verified by the
      Banker.)

      After one week each of the Stocks shall be transfered from the
      Bank to the highest bidder. If two or more bids for Stock X are
      exactly equal, the Stock shall go to player X (if one of the
      highest bidders), or to the Player with the lowest score.

      If a given Stock X is bought by Player X, the Marks of the bid
      shall be transfered from Player X to the Bank.
      If a given Stock X is bought by another Player (or Players) then
      Player X, the Marks of the bid shall go from this Player(s) to

Rule 726 (Mutable)
Starting Points and No Unpermitted Point Changes

726.  Initial scores

      All Players begin with 0 Points, except that new Voters who
      enter part-way through a Game in progress shall be given the
      average of the scores of all active Players scores, not

      Points may not be gained, lost, or traded except as explicitly
      stated in the Rules.

========================================

Rule 728 (Mutable)
Destruction of and Compensation for Stocks of Leaving Players

728.  Stocks of leaving Players I

      When Player X leaves the game, Stock X shall be destroyed.
      If Stock X was held at that time by another Player, this Player
      shall be compensated with half the price in Marks that this
      Player paid for the Stock X.
      These Marks shall come from the account of Player X, *before*
      those shall be destroyed, as required by other Rules.
      If there are not enough Marks available, the deficit shall be
      paid by the Bank.
      This Rule applies to the Stock of Players that have left the

      An Official is any Player who has been Appointed or Elected to
      an Office specified in the Rules. A Judge is not an Officer.
      An Officer may be replaced by another Player, by a Proposal
      stating so, and that Proposal passes.
      An Officer may resign at any time, provided e appoints a
      successor.
      If an Officer resigns while a Proposal is being voted upon to
      replace eim, the Player proposed will by eis Successor.
      This Rule applies to general Offices, and therefore defers to
      Rules for specific Offices.

Rule 736 (Mutable)
The Marxist

736.  The Marxist

      Let there be the Patent Title known as "Marxist", which is
      awarded to the Player with the most Marks, or if tied, to the
      Players with the most Marks. Only the current richest Player
      or Players may hold this title.

      The determination and announcement of assignment and revoking
      of the Title is made by the Banker, who must use the most
      accurate means of determining this available to eim, and must
      make the announcement as soon as possible after becoming aware
      of a change in holder of the Title.

      However: To respect some Players' wish for privacy, and in

Definition of a Conserved Quantity

747.  Definition of a Conserved Quantity

      An Entity is only a Conserved Quantity if a Rule explicitly

      Destroyed as explicitly stated by the Rules. If a Conserved
      Quantity is given to an Entity, and no Rule states where that
      Conserved Quantity is to be taken from, then the transfer shall
      not take place. If a Conserved Quantity is taken from an Entity,

      transfered to, then the Conserved Quantity shall be transfered
      to the Bank.

Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal

761.  Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal: Adjusting for Abstentions

      When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the Votes which
      have been legally cast shall be counted by the Speaker. If a
      Proposal is not Contested, and there are more FOR votes cast
      then AGAINST votes, then that Proposal shall take effect.  If
      such a Proposal has an equal number of FOR and AGAINST Votes,
      then the Speaker shall decide whether the Proposal shall be
      Adopted, or if that Proposal shall fail. If the Proposal is
      Contested, and the number of FOR votes cast is at least twice
      the number of AGAINST votes cast, then that Proposal shall take
      effect.

      If a Rule will change the actions required of or forbidden to
      the Speaker, and the Speaker opposed the Proposal, then that
      Proposal shall be considered Contested. The Speaker shall

Mischief

764.  Mischief

      Any Player or Group X may perform an Act of Mischief directed
      at any Player or Group Y.  The permissible forms of Mischief
      are defined in other Rules; such definitions must include a 
      positive Price in Coins, or the form of Mischief is not
      permissible.  This Rule explicitly takes precedence over all
      other Rules which purport to determine which forms of Mischief
      are permissible.

      To cause an Act of Mischief,  X  sends to the Public Forum a
      message containing:
      - the Name of the object, Y;
      - the effect of the Act of Mischief;
      - the Number of the Rule which permits the form of Mischief;
      - indication of which Coins in X's account will be used as
      payment for the Act of Mischief.  Coins of Group Y, or the
      Group to which Player Y belongs, may not be used as payment.  

      The effect of the Act of Mischief is applied immediately upon 
      publication of the above message in the Forum.  An additional
      effect of this Act of Mischief is that
      - for each Coin of Group Z spent as payment above, two Points
      are removed from the Z Treasury;
      - the Coins used as payment above are removed from X's account
      and destroyed.

Rule 766 (Mutable)
Groups

766.  Amend Rule 714.

      A Group is initially formed by a set of Players which has
      registered with the Registrar to form a Group; other Players may
      join later.  Each Group has a Name, a Membership, a Vizier,
      an Ordinancekeepor, a Treasury, an Initial Set of Ordinances,
      and an associated form of Currency, called the <name> Coins,
      where <name> is the Name of the Group.

      1.  The Name may not be the Name of another Group.

      2.  The Membership is a set of Players;  these Players are
      Members of the Group, and all other Players are not.

      3.  Synchronously with the registration of a Group, two Offices
      are created known as the <name> Vizier, and the <name>
      Ordinancekeepor, where <name> is the Name of the Group.
      These Offices may never be empty, and the <name> Vizier and
      <name> Ordinancekeepor must both be a member of <name> Group.
      The <name> Vizier shall inform the Registrar whenever the
      Membership or the Ordinancekeepor of the <name> group changes.
      When the <name> Vizier changes, the new Vizier shall inform the
      Registrar of the change.
      The <name> Ordinancekeepor shall keep an accurate and current
      record of the Ordinances of the <name> Group.

      4.  The Treasury is a repository for Points and Currencies and
      has the same capabilities for holding, trading, and spending
      Points and Currencies as does a Player.

      5.  The Ordinances are a description of the operation of the
      Group.

      6.  The <name> Coins are a form of Currency which is created
      synchronously with the registration of the Group.  The <name>
      Group may create <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be
      placed in the <name> Treasury.  The <name> Group may destroy
      <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be removed from the
      <name> Treasury.

      Ordinances of a Group may determine how and when the Group
      casts its Votes; if the Ordinances are silent on this issue
      then the Group may not cast its Votes.  The Votes of the
      Group are cast when the Vizier sends a message to the Speaker
      to that effect during the Voting Period and this action is
      legitimate insofar as the Ordinances are concerned.

      When a Player submits a Proposal, e may pay one Mark to the Bank
      (if e has at least one Mark) and impose Sanity on that Proposal.
      E must inform both the Banker and the Speaker when doing so.
      A Proposal which has Sanity imposed upon it is known as a Sane
      Proposal.  The Speaker shall, when e distributes a Sane
      Proposal, inform the Players that it is a Sane Proposal.

      No non-Voter Nomic entity may Vote on a Sane Proposal.  Each
      Voter shall have exactly one Vote on a Sane Proposal, and
      each Voter's Vote shall be counted exactly once on a Sane
      Proposal.

      This rule takes precedence over any rule allowing a non-Voter
      Nomic entity to Vote; over any rule which gives any Voter
      more or less than one Vote on a proposal; and over any
      rule which would cause any Voter's Vote to be counted more or

      of one or more Rules, and this CFJ is Judged TRUE, then the
      Judge must issue an Injunction that the Ninny submit a Formal
      Apology.  This Injunction may also include a list of up to ten
      Prescribed Words.  By a Formal Apology is meant a letter of at
      least 200 words, containing all of the Prescribed Words,
      explaining the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
      for self-improvement, and posted in the Public Forum.  Within 48
      hours of the posting of this Formal Apology, the Squealer must
      either submit a Proposal that the Ninny's Apology be accepted,
      or submit a Proposal that the Ninny's Aplology be rejected,
      but not both.  No other Player may submit such a Proposal, and
      the Squealer may submit only one.  If a Proposal to accept the
      Apology fails, or if a Proposal to reject the Apology passes,
      then the Ninny loses 5 Points.

Abandonment of Speakerhood

785.  Improve Speaker Succession I

      If the Speaker has abandoned eir post, another new, Temporary
      Speaker is selected according to the "Rules of Succession", or
      if no such rules are defined, the other Player not on hold with
      the highest Score becomes the temporary Speaker.  This does not
      force the Game to be over in this case, and Scores are not reset
      to 0. The Game continues until a Player Wins, at which time a
      new Game is begun and the Winner becomes the real Speaker. The
      Temporary Speaker shall make reasonable effort to obtain the
      former Speaker's materials: proposal queue, voting records, etc.
      but if this is not possible, then the Temporary Speaker shall
      request that these be resubmitted by the Players. If a Speaker
      is replaced in this manner, e has eir score set to minus 2N
      Points immediately, where N is the number of Points required for
      a Player to Win the Game.

      Abandonment is determined as follows: If any Player suspects
      that the Speaker has Abandoned, e sends a message to all Players
      calling on the Speaker to announce eir presence.  The Speaker
      must reply to all Players within one week; if e does not, e is

      Rules relevant to that CFJ, which must include the Rule in
      question.  If the statement is Judged TRUE, the Judge may
      include with the Judgement an Injuction requiring the Rulekeepor

      The annotation shall remain only until one of the Rules
      in the list of relevant Rules is amended, repealed, or
      transmuted; or until a CFJ determines that the injunction no
      longer applies, as described below.  While it remains, it shall
      guide the application of that Rule.

      If a Player believes that the circumstances which led to the

      Criminal Court. If a Player admits to being Guilty before
      Criminal Court has been called, then a Criminal Court shall not
      be called for that instance of that Crime, and the Player shall
      suffer any penalties for committing the Crime.  This Rule takes

848.  Determining when a Rule has been broken:

      If a Player believes that any Player has not abided by a Rule
      then in effect, in the form in which it was then in effect, then
      the Player may invoke Judgement on a Statement to that effect.
      Similarly, if a Player believes that any Player has commited a
      Crime, e may invoke Judgement on a Statement to that effect.
      Either kind of Statement is known as an Accusation.  A Criminal
      Court is defined as the Judge of an Accusation.
      However,
        -The Accusing player immediately loses 5 points.
        -No Player may be so Accused of actions committed before the
         adoption of this Rule or more than 30 days before the
         Accusation.
        -No Player may be so Accused more than once concerning the
         same committed act, unless the last such Accusation has been
         judged UNDECIDED.
        -The following exception takes precedence over previous Rules 
         concerning Judgement: Neither Accusing nor Accused Player may
         act as Judge for the Accusation; in any case where this would
         occur, a random Voter, neither Accuser nor Accused, shall be
         Judge.
      If the Statement is judged TRUE, the Accused Player has been
      found Guilty of breaking the Rule or committing the Crime, as
      applicable.  If the Statement is judged FALSE, the Accused
      Player has been found Not Guilty of breaking the Rule or
      committing the Crime, as applicable.

This is my fault.  I processed them quickly because /I/ am the
one who is holding up this game.  I would be very upset with
me if I was a Player in this game, so I rushed what I could.

Sorry.

The CFJ is 121 and I am solely responsible for the errors that I
commit.

Here are the Proposals that are lacking Outcome announcements.  I have 
deleted rationales for sake of brevity. Please see pt.1 of this message 
for a record of how Players voted & made Vototron contributions. 

Speaker jeffrey s.
==================
Proposal 849 (Garth)

Salaries of Officers
(Creates a Rule)

Officers (excluding Viziers, Ordinancekeepors, and any other Officers
whose duties pertain only to a single Group) shall receive a salary of
3 Points per week.

This Rule applies to Offices in general, and defers to the Rules for
specific Offices.

Passes 5-1-0
===================
Proposal 850 (Garth)

Good and Bad News for the Scorekeepor
(Amends a Rule)

The sentence of Rule 493 that begins with the word "Salary:" is amended
to read:  "The Offices of Scorekeepor and Auditor may not be held by the
same Player."

Fails 3-5-1
====================
Proposal 851 (Garth)

One Player, One Vote
(Amends a Rule)

Rule 206 is Amended to read:

Each Player shall have exactly one Vote.

Fails 4-6-0
=============
Proposal 852 (Oerjan)

Mandatory actions are not crimes
(Creates a Rule)

It is never a Crime for any Player to perform an action which is
required of em by the Rules. This Rule takes precedence over any
Rules defining what is or is not a Crime.

Passes 7-3-0
============
Proposal 853 (Oerjan)

Code of honor
(Creates a Rule)

In order to make an Oath, a Player must send a message
to at least one other Player, stating the fact that they
are making an Oath, and what the Oath is.

If someone makes an Oath, e must do that which e has sworn
to do, as long as it is legal for em to do so.

E who defies this has broken this Rule, and shall also be guilty of
a Class C Crime.

No rule may force someone to make an Oath;
this rule takes precedence over all rules that attempt to do so.

Passes 9-3-0
===================
Proposal 854 (Garth)

The Yes-Man
(Creates a Rule)

Let there be an Entity known as the Yes-Man.  The Yes-Man shall
have one Vote for each Proposal.

As soon as possible after the start of each Nomic Week, the
Yes-Man shall be sold in an Auction for Marks.  The Auctioneer
shall be the owner of the Yes-Man.  If the Auction is not
completed by the end of the Nomic Week, the Yes-Man shall be
considered to have been sold to the current highest bidder.
In any event, ownership of the Yes-Man shall not be transferred
before the end of the Nomic Week.  Any Marks paid for the
Yes-Man shall be placed in the Bank.

While a Player owns the Yes-Man, it shall cast its Vote on each
Proposal in precisely the same manner as its owner.

The first owner of the Yes-Man shall be the Bank, and the Auctioneer
of the first Auction for it shall be the Banker.

Fails 5-7-1

is Public Information.

Proposal 856 (Garth)

Conserved Quantities Really ARE Conserved, Part I
(Creates a Rule)

Any Proposal which introduces a new way to Create or Destroy
a Conserved Quantity shall require at least three times as

Conserved Quantities or Create the initial stock of a new
Conserved Quantity.

Passes 7-3-0
=========================
Proposal 857 (Garth)

Conserved Quantities Really ARE Conserved, Part II
(Creates a Rule)

Any Player who makes a Proposal which eliminates ways of Creating
or Destroying a Conserved Quantity shall receive 10 Points from the
Point Reserve upon that Proposal being Adopted.  This award shall
not be given for Proposals which eliminate the only Rule describing
a particular Conserved Quantity or which eliminate the Rule that
Creates the initial stock of a Conserved Quantity.

Fails 4-8-1
=======================
Proposal 858 (Garth)

Sweepstakes and the Sweepstakes Pots
(Creates a Rule)

A Sweepstakes is a contest of luck or skill in which the Winner or
Winners are awarded Points or Currencies.  The Proposal Lottery is
a Sweepstakes; other Sweepstakes may be defined in other legislation.
Any Player or Nomic Entity which may own and trade Points or Currencies
may participate in any Sweepstakes, unless forbidden in other Rules.

For each Sweepstakes defined in the Rules, let there be an Entity
known as the <name> Pot where <name> is the name of the Sweepstakes in
question.  Pots may own Points and Currencies in exactly the same way
as Players.  The Sweepstakes Officer shall keep track of the amount
of Points and Currencies in each Pot, and shall report on the contents
of each to the Public Forum at least once a Nomic Week.

Sweepstakes are administered by the Sweepstakes Officer, who shall
announce the Winner or Winners of each Sweepstakes and the amount
Won to the Public Forum each time a Sweepstakes is Won.  Upon 
Winning, the Winners have the Points and Currencies in the Pot split
evenly between them unless legislation shall determine otherwise.  If
an even split cannot be made, the excess shall remain in the Pot.

Any random determinations needed to decide the Winner or Winners of a
Sweepstakes shall be made by the Sweepstakes Officer.

Fails 6-7-0
