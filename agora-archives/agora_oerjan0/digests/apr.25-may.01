Uh, Mr. Scorekeeper, I think that your score report is slightly off.  
Particularly in the Stock dividend portion where instead of crediting 
5% where required, you just credited everyone who owned stock 2 points 
per stock owned.

What gives?

Duane

Here's a Proto-Proposal that would permit the Game to be suspended.

                        Garth

========================

Suspending the Game:  Limbo
(Creates a Rule)

Let there be a Game State known as Limbo.

When the Game is in Limbo, no official Nomic actions may be taken by
any Player or Entity, and all Players and Entities are absolved of
any Nomic duties they would otherwise perform.

The Game may only enter Limbo upon the passage of a special Decree,
which must explicitly specify the amount of time the Game shall be
in Limbo.  Once the Game leaves Limbo, it shall be restored to the
State immediately before entering Limbo.

Such a Decree need not be recorded, and shall be submitted with the
following legal Declaration:
  (Enter Limbo)

This Rule takes precedence over Rules that would otherwise specify
permitted or required Nomic actions while the Game is in Limbo.

[Allows Oerjan's "Holiday Breaks" if a majority of the Players agree.]

Here are some new Proposals.  The Proposal Queue is wide open.

                      Speaker Garth

========================

Proposal 907 (Nicol) P
(Amends a rule)

The phrase "email correspondence in rule 805 is to be replaced with the
word "activity" so that rule 805 will be more general.

[ Not a bad idea.  However, I must note that because it has no Title,
Nicol is guilty of a Class B Crime. ]

========================

PROPOSAL 908 (Lance) P

Time Requirement for Formal Apologies
(Ammends a Rule)

The 3rd sentence of the Rule entitled "Formal Apologies" is ammended to
read:

      "By a Formal Apology is meant a letter of at least 200
      words, containing all of the Prescribed Words, explaining
      the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire for
      self-improvement, and posted in the Public Forum within 72
      hours of the posting of the Injunction to the Public Forum.
      If the Ninny fails to meet these criteria e shall lose 10
      points."

Also, change all instances of the phrase "48 hours" in the Rule
entitled "Formal Apologies" to "72 hours".

[ Justification: Chuck noted that Formal Apologies are unenforceable
  because there is no time limit on when the F.A. must be submitted.
  This will put one in and put some teeth behind it if the Ninny
  does not Apologize.

  Oerjan argues that 48 hours is too short so I am changing the time
  frame for both the Ninny's Apology and the Squealer's Proposal to
  72 hours. ]

[ This patches a nagging hole. I'm all for it. ]

========================

PROPOSAL 909 (KoJen)

It
(creates a rule)

Let there be a distinction known as "It". Any Player may be "It". No
other entity may be "It".

Once a Player is "It", e remains "It" until e ceases to be a Player,
or until e makes another Player "It". E does this by choosing another
Player and stating in a public message that this other Player is "It".

While there is a Player who is "It", no other Player may nominate a
Player to be "It".

If at any time no Player is "It", any Player may nominate a Player to
be "It" by stating this in a public message.

Upon passage of this Rule, if any Player voted against this, the first
Player to have voted AGAINST the Proposal becomes "It". If no Player
voted against this, the last Player to have voted FOR this Proposal
becomes "It". The Speaker's records are to be used for dating
purposes.

[ Speaker's Note:  One word:  Why? ]

========================

Proposal 910 (Garth) P

The Justices and the Justiciar
(Creates a Rule)

Let there be three Players known as the Justices, and an Office 
known as the Justiciar.  The Justiciar shall not receive a weekly
salary.  The Speaker and the Clerk of the Courts are ineligible
to be Justiciar.

The positions of Justice shall be held by the Speaker, the Clerk
of the Courts, and the Justiciar;  or by their representatives as
detailed in this Rule.

The Justices shall have the duty to Judge Statements that have
been Appealed.  They shall receive the same compensation as
Judges for each Statement so Judged.

The Speaker and Clerk may delegate their duties as Justices to
other willing Players if they desire.  They must do so if a
Player would otherwise hold more than one position of Justice.

Any Justice must so delegate eir duties for a particular case
if e made the original CFJ, if e was the Judge of the original
CFJ, or if e was Accused by that CFJ of breaking a Rule or
committing a Crime.

If no Player is willing to receive the duties of Justice for a
case, the Clerk of the Courts shall select one randomly.

[ This Proposal and the following one change our current system
of Appeal away from the Proposal format (which many people don't
like) toward the old Appeals Court.  However, this Appeal Court
is made of three Officers, which I think should give more
accountability than three random Players. ]

[ For the record, the Speaker does not oppose this Proposal. ]

==========================

Proposal 911 (Garth) P

Appealing Judgement
(Amends a Rule)

Rule 690 is Amended in its entirety to read:

A Judgement may be Appealed upon the insistence of any three Players to
the Public Forum.

If a Judgement is successfully Appealed, the Justices shall each Judge
the Statement as if they were Judges.  They may confer with each other
on the case before delivering Judgement if they desire.  If a Justice
should fail to return Judgement in the allotted time, e shall be fined
three Points for each day by which e missed the deadline.  This fine
shall be levied by the Scorekeepor.

If a majority of the Justices' Judgements agree, the Statement shall be
considered to have been Judged accordingly.  Otherwise, it shall be
considered to have been ruled UNDECIDED.  The Justices' reasoning
and arguments shall be recorded with the original CFJ.

Once a Judgement has been made, the Justices may make Injunctions just
as may Judges, provided a majority of them agree.

The decision of the Justices is final; no further Appeal of that
Statement may be made.

If the decision of the original Judge of the Statement is changed by
the Justices, the Judge shall return the compensation e received to the
Point Reserve.

======================

Proposal 912 (Garth) P

Get Rid of Appeal By Proposal
(Amends a Rule)

The sentence of Rule 799 that begins with the phrase (Appeal by Proposal)
is hereby removed.

=======================

Proposal 913 (Garth)

The Name of the Game
(Creates a Rule)

The Official Name of this Nomic shall be Agora.

[ Agora was the winner of the Name of the Game Contest, and so I'm
Proposing it, as promised. ]

===========================

Proposal 914 (Garth) P

Group Proposals
(Creates a Rule)

A Group as a whole may make Proposals.  Such Proposals are submitted
by the Group's Vizier, and are treated precisely as Proposals submitted
by Players, except that they do not count toward any Proposal limits or
quotas.

At most one such Group Proposal per Group may be submitted per Nomic
Week;  Group Proposals shall only be made as explicitly permitted in
the Group Ordinances.

After the Voting Period, a Group that submitted a Group Proposal shall
receive 2 * (F-A) Points, where F is the number of Votes cast FOR the
Group Proposal, and A is the number of Votes cast AGAINST it.

This Rule takes precedence over any Rule defining a Proposal limit or
quota.

[ Gives Groups a chance to officially define themselves.  State their
platforms in actions, so to speak.  And a Group that can charm other
Groups into going along is rewarded, just as Players are. ]

=========================

Proposal 915 (Garth) P

Entities Are People Too!
(Creates a Rule)

Any Nomic Entity which can own Points and Currencies shall receive
Interest from its Marks and Dividends from its Stocks in exactly
the same manner as Players.

Similarly, if other Currencies shall affect their owner's Points,
such Nomic Entities shall be affected in exactly the same manner
as Players.

This Rule takes precedence over Rules describing Currencies.

[ Lets Groups (for example) earn Interest and Dividends.  This has
long struck me as a bug in the Currency Rules. ]

The Judge is Ian

Caller:         Vlad
Date:           Tue Apr  5 23:22:10 1994

Judge:          Ian
Date Assigned:  Tue Apr 26 00:53:18 EDT 1994

The Statement:

Statement: Proposal 886 is not a Contested Proposal

Arguments: Garth claims that proposal 886, by forcing
him to kill himself, will prevent him from carrying
out his duties as Speaker. Therefore, he has the right
to declare it Contested. This is incorrect. First of all,
Rule 498 says, in part:
  " A Player is a person who is registered as a Player..."
Now, since a corpse is not a person, at least as meant in this
Rule, therefore Garth will not be a Player, and therefore
not Speaker. Therefore, to speak of his duties as Speaker
after the passage of this proposal is meaningless.

 Second argument: Rule 761 reads, in part:
   "If a Rule will change the actions required of
or forbidden to the Speaker..."
Proposal 886 will do no such thing. Therefore, the Speaker
has no right to declare this Proposal Contested.

  Q.E.D.

Call For Judgement 135

The Judge is Nicol

Caller:         Stella?
Date:           Fri Apr  8 06:09:03 1994

Judge:          Nicol
Date Assigned:  Tue Apr 26 00:57:47 EDT 1994

The Statement:

"Whereas, Rule 404 imposes that
    `As long as *a Proposal* satisfies all requirements in place at the
      time of its making for *the proper making of Proposals*, the act
      of making such a Proposal is legal regardless of its content';
whereas, there is a difference in meaning between `a Proposal' (the
     Nomic entity, that is the text) and `the making of a Proposal'
     (an action);
whereas, any Proposal text therefore trivially satisfies the requirements
     related to the making of Proposals;
whereas, Rule 404 precedes Rules 791, 792 and 843, which impose
     limits on the number of Proposal submissions;
therefore it is legal to submit Proposals even if the Proposal queue
     is filled and even if the limit of PL/2 proposals per Player
     has been passed"

Argument:
404 says that it is legal to make Proposals if that Proposal
satisfies a certain requirement. However, that requirement relates
to the act of making a Proposal rather than to the form or text of
the Proposal. It is therefore trivially satisfied.
Thus it is therefore legal to submit Proposals at *all* times,
as 404 takes precedence over the three Rules (791, 792 and 843) imposing
limits on the submission of Proposals.

Note, that 791 claims precedence over `other Rules which require sooner
distribution'. However, 404 talks about the making of Proposals, *not*
about their distribution.

>      As long as a Proposal satisfies all requirements in place at the
>      time of its making for the proper making of Proposals, the act
>      of making such a Proposal is legal regardless of its content.
>      It is legal to propose a Rule which conflicts with other Rules

>791.  Limits On Proposals Up For Vote
>      There may be no more than PL Proposals up for Vote at any given

>
>      When the number of Proposals up for Vote has dropped to PL/2 or
>      below, the Speaker shall announce that Proposals are once again

>
>843.  Limits On Proposals Sent To Speaker
>
>      No Player may send more than PL/2 Proposals to the Speaker
>      during any given Week.  Proposals in excess of this number are

>      manner". A 2 Point penalty is assessed by the Speaker for every
>      Proposal submitted in excess of this number; responsibility for

Agora Nomic Scorekeepor
----------------

Argument:

    Rule 726 clearly states that a Voter joining a Game in progress
    will receive an initial Points score equal to the average of the
    scores of all active Players whose scores are negative.

    I received an initial score of 0 points instead.

[ Editorial from the CotC:  The scoring error this CFJ addresses has
  been corrected by Scorekeepor Kojen already.  Is there a means of
  withdrawing a CFJ? ]

Call For Judgement 137

The Judge is Jason

Caller:         Chuck
Date:           Thu Apr 14 03:17:02 1994

Judge:          Jason
Date Assigned:  Tue Apr 26 01:05:45 EDT 1994

The Statement:

There is not now, and has never been, a Rule with the number 885
AND "this Rule" in proposal 885 has no referent
AND proposal 885 had no effect.

Argument:

I don't really care much if this is judged TRUE or FALSE--as Rulekeepor,
I just want some guidance from the Judge.  As I pointed out in
my earlier comments on this proposal, it seems to me there are
two consistent intepretations: 1) proposal 885, which is a proposal
to Repeal a Rule, never became a Rule; thus, "this Rule" in
885 has no referent.  2) proposal 885 Created a Rule *in spite*
of its declaration of (Repeals a Rule).

If the Judge judges this FALSE, I would also ask him to comment on
the truth-value on each of the three individual parts of the coumpound
statement for Judgement.


Proposal 885 (Ian)

Repeals unnecessary Rule
(Repeals a Rule)

The previous Rule submitted by the Player who submitted this rule
which amended Rule #454, is, for the purposes of this Rule only,
referred to by the name Fred. If Fred has been adopted, then upon
the passage of this rule, Rule #455 shall be Repealed. If Fred was
not adopted, then this rule, if adopted, shall be considered null
and void and shall be removed from the Rule Set.

The Judge is Dave Bowen

Caller:         Chuck
Date:           Sun Apr 17 20:42:42 1994

Judge:          Dave Bowen
Date Assigned:  Tue Apr 26 01:12:55 EDT 1994

The Statement:

Chuck violated Rule 399 by not posting the Current Ruleset
in the Nomic Week beginning Mon., Mar. 11, 1994 GMT.

Argument:

While it's difficult to prove that something *wasn't* done, consider
that: 1) I admit that I didn't do it, and 2) the Assistant should be
able to confirm that he didn't receive a Current Ruleset during
the week in question.  Those two together should constitute a
proof (as nearly as can be proven) that it wasn't done.

(I have no good excuse for not posting the CR in the week.  I meant
to do it over the weekend, but it turns out that I had a Real Life.
Don't worry, it won't happen again. ;)


Rule 399 (Mutable)
The Office of the Rulekeepor

399.  The Office of the Rulekeepor:

      Let there be an Officer known as the Rulekeepor.
      The Rulekeepor shall maintain a complete list of the current
      Rules, and post this list to all Players at least once a week.
      
      So long as the Rulekeepor is in Office, the Speaker is not
      required to maintain or distribute the Rules.

Rule 459 (Mutable)
The Nomic Week

459.  The Nomic Week

      The Nomic Week begins at midnight, GMT, each Monday. Any
      automatic change in the state of the Game which must occur
      weekly occurs at the beginning of the Nomic Week unless
      otherwise stated in the Rules. Any activity which must occur
      at least weekly must occur at least once each Nomic Week.

Here is my Voting Ratio Proto-Proposal again.  Will people Vote FOR

                    Garth

========================

Proposal xxx (Garth)

Default Rules for Adopting Proposals
(Amends a Rule)

Rule 761 is Amended in its entirety to read:

When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the Votes which
have been legally cast shall be counted by the Speaker. If a
Proposal is not Contested, and the ratio of FOR Votes to AGAINST
Votes exceeds the mandated Adoption Ratio for that Proposal, then
that Proposal shall be Adopted.  If the ratio for such a Proposal
exactly equals the required Adoption Ratio, then the Speaker shall
decide whether the Proposal shall be Adopted, or if that Proposal
shall fail.

The Adoption Ratio for all Proposals shall be 1:1, unless otherwise
specified in the Rules.  Unanimity is defined as an Adoption Ratio
of 1:0.

If a Rule will directly change the actions required of or forbidden
to the Speaker, and the Speaker opposed the Proposal, then that
Proposal shall be considered Contested. The Speaker shall declare
if e opposes the Proposal when e distributes the Proposal.  A
Contested Proposal shall have its Adoption Ratio doubled.

[ Lets Rules define classes of Proposals that require less or more
Votes than a simple majority.  Several existing Rules are languishing
for lack of this. ]

[ Also relieves the Speaker of a headache.  Ie, what happens when a
2:1 or unanimous Proposal is Contested? ]

Here is the corrected (?) dividend report.
The first column is the player's score, the 2nd what e pays, the 3rd
what e gains. An asterisk in the `dividend loss' column means that
the player owns eis own stock.
I'll add the corrections to the next regular score report.
Better now?

==========================
The Statement:

There is not now, and has never been, a Rule with the number 885
AND "this Rule" in proposal 885 has no referent
AND proposal 885 had no effect.

Argument:

I don't really care much if this is judged TRUE or FALSE--as Rulekeepor,
I just want some guidance from the Judge.  As I pointed out in
my earlier comments on this proposal, it seems to me there are
two consistent intepretations: 1) proposal 885, which is a proposal
to Repeal a Rule, never became a Rule; thus, "this Rule" in
885 has no referent.  2) proposal 885 Created a Rule *in spite*
of its declaration of (Repeals a Rule).

If the Judge judges this FALSE, I would also ask him to comment on
the truth-value on each of the three individual parts of the coumpound
statement for Judgement.


Proposal 885 (Ian)

Repeals unnecessary Rule
(Repeals a Rule)

The previous Rule submitted by the Player who submitted this rule
which amended Rule #454, is, for the purposes of this Rule only,
referred to by the name Fred. If Fred has been adopted, then upon
the passage of this rule, Rule #455 shall be Repealed. If Fred was
not adopted, then this rule, if adopted, shall be considered null
and void and shall be removed from the Rule Set.

Proposal PASSES, 9-2-1

==========================

Judgment on CFJ 137.

(Caller Chuck, Judge Jason)

STATEMENT:

  There is not now, and has never been, a Rule with the number 885
  AND "this Rule" in proposal 885 has no referent
  AND proposal 885 had no effect.


I hereby judge this to be TRUE.

My argument is as follows: Proposal 885 has as a declaration "Repeals
a Rule".  If we take this declaration in good faith, we are surprised 
by
reading in the body of the proposal references to "this Rule", as if 
the
proposal were actually creating a rule.

If the somewhat confusing Proposal 885 is considered carefully, its
intent seems to be something like this: create a rule 885, repeal rule
455, and then repeal rule 885, ie. the same rule it first created.
Proposal 885 is reproduced below for your convenience:

  Repeals unnecessary Rule
  (Repeals a Rule)

  The previous Rule submitted by the Player who submitted this rule
  which amended Rule #454, is, for the purposes of this Rule only,
  referred to by the name Fred. If Fred has been adopted, then upon
  the passage of this rule, Rule #455 shall be Repealed. If Fred was
  not adopted, then this rule, if adopted, shall be considered null
  and void and shall be removed from the Rule Set.

In my opinion, the player submitting the proposal should have (roughly
speaking) replaced instances of "this rule" in Proposal 885 with "this
proposal", as the proposal was never really about creating a rule but
repealing one.

It might be argued that it is legal to propose enacting one rule,
repealing another, and then repealing the first rule (all in one
proposal).  Indeed, Rule 115 tells us that "no Rule Change or type of
move is impermissible solely on account of the self-reference or
self-application of a Rule".   However, if this was the real intent of
the proposal, it should have been declared as "(Other)", as there is 
no
convenient declaration for trying to do all this in one proposal.  (I
believe it may then have been a legal proposal: Rule 594 says a 
proposal
cannot enact or amend more than one rule, but is silent on the 
question
of repealing more than one rule).

I am aware that Rule 404 says that "it is legal to propose a Rule 
which
conflicts with other Rules or with itself, which is paradoxical, or
which cannot be applied".  I believe that this rule still does not 
make
Proposal 885 valid, however, as Proposal 885's declaration asks us to
interpret it as being about the repeal of one rule (and therefore not
being about the creation of any rules).

In line with this judgement, I issue the following injunction:

Proposal 885 shall be deemed to have been improperly proposed.
Consequently, Rule 455 must be re-instated in the Rule Set.

====================

The Statement:

Statement: Proposal 886 is not a Contested Proposal

Arguments: Garth claims that proposal 886, by forcing
him to kill himself, will prevent him from carrying
out his duties as Speaker. Therefore, he has the right
to declare it Contested. This is incorrect. First of all,
Rule 498 says, in part:
  " A Player is a person who is registered as a Player..."
Now, since a corpse is not a person, at least as meant in this
Rule, therefore Garth will not be a Player, and therefore
not Speaker. Therefore, to speak of his duties as Speaker
after the passage of this proposal is meaningless.

 Second argument: Rule 761 reads, in part:
   "If a Rule will change the actions required of
or forbidden to the Speaker..."
Proposal 886 will do no such thing. Therefore, the Speaker
has no right to declare this Proposal Contested.

  Q.E.D.

=================

The Judgement:

Judgement: FALSE

Arguments [Ian]:  I see my job here as being to determine whether or not
Proposal 886 is a contested proposal. So let's look for the Rules that
determine whether or not a rule is contested. The only rule that includes
the word "contested" is Rule #761 (see below).  The relevant part of this
rule states:

         If a Rule will change the actions required of or forbidden to the
   Speaker, and the Speaker opposed the Proposal, then that Proposal shall be
   considered Contested. The Speaker shall declare if e opposes the Proposal
   when e distributes the Proposal.

"If a Rule will change the actions required of or forbidden to the Speaker,"

Proposal 886 said that "...all Players must kill themselves."  This is an
action that would be required of the Speaker (along with all other Players,
to be sure). Therefore, it satisfies that requirement.

"and the Speaker opposed the Proposal,"

We must include the next sentence here - "The Speaker shall declare if e
opposes the Proposal when e distributes the Proposal." The Speaker did,
indeed, indicate that sie opposed the proposal when sie distributed it.
Therefore, it satisfies that requirement.

"then that Proposal shall be considered Contested."

This Proposal is a Contested proposal.

To speak to Vlad's arguments for a moment, sie is right when sie says that
a corpse is not a Player (IMHO), and therefore cannot be the Speaker, but
that doesn't fit in here. What is important is that Proposal 886 would
require the Speaker to do something, something sie didn't want to do. That
is why sie opposed the proposal and made it contested.

Relevant Rules and Proposals:
=====

Rule 761
Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal

      When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the Votes which have
been legally cast shall be counted by the Speaker. If a Proposal is not
Contested, and there are more FOR votes cast then AGAINST votes, then that
Proposal shall take effect.  If such a Proposal has an equal number of FOR
and AGAINST Votes, then the Speaker shall decide whether the Proposal shall
be Adopted, or if that Proposal shall fail. If the Proposal is Contested,
and the number of FOR votes cast is at least twice the number of AGAINST
votes cast, then that Proposal shall take effect.
      If a Rule will change the actions required of or forbidden to the
Speaker, and the Speaker opposed the Proposal, then that Proposal shall be
considered Contested. The Speaker shall declare if e opposes the Proposal
when e distributes the Proposal.
(*Was: 658*)

=====

Proposal 886 (Vlad)
(Creates a Rule)

Test to see if Players take the Rules too Seriously

Within 24 hours of the passage of this proposal,
all Players must kill themselves.

[ Speaker's Note:  Since I have to be alive to perform my duties
as Speaker, I hereby Oppose this Proposal.  It is Contested. ]

  Dear friends,

  Regardless of what you thought of my Proposal, or
whether it was Contested, a very serious matter has
just occured. Ian judged my CFJ false, on the grounds
that Proposal 886 affects all Players, and therefore the 
Speaker.
  Although, to my knowledge that has never been used as
grounds to contest a proposal in the past, and indeed was
tacitly considered a NoNo(tm), we nevertheless have a
new Game Custom on the issue.
  This means that any rule affecting the actions of the Speaker
even indirectly my be contested. Such Rules include the
Distributor Rules, any rule concerning the duties of the
Archivist (which post Garth holds), any rule describing
legal votes, legal declarations, legal CFJ's, legal Apologies,
in fact any restriction on a Player's actions or any
action mandated to Players.
  This is an intolerable tyranny and a mockery of democracy.
Let us either overturn this Judgement or Amend/Repeal #761.
Please communicate your preference.

  Vlad

                    2 for Judgement within 72 hours

====================

The Statement:

"Whereas, Rule 404 imposes that
    `As long as *a Proposal* satisfies all requirements in place at the
      time of its making for *the proper making of Proposals*, the act
      of making such a Proposal is legal regardless of its content';
whereas, there is a difference in meaning between `a Proposal' (the
     Nomic entity, that is the text) and `the making of a Proposal'
     (an action);
whereas, any Proposal text therefore trivially satisfies the requirements
     related to the making of Proposals;
whereas, Rule 404 precedes Rules 791, 792 and 843, which impose
     limits on the number of Proposal submissions;
therefore it is legal to submit Proposals even if the Proposal queue
     is filled and even if the limit of PL/2 proposals per Player
     has been passed"

Argument:
404 says that it is legal to make Proposals if that Proposal
satisfies a certain requirement. However, that requirement relates
to the act of making a Proposal rather than to the form or text of
the Proposal. It is therefore trivially satisfied.
Thus it is therefore legal to submit Proposals at *all* times,
as 404 takes precedence over the three Rules (791, 792 and 843) imposing
limits on the submission of Proposals.

Note, that 791 claims precedence over `other Rules which require sooner
distribution'. However, 404 talks about the making of Proposals, *not*
about their distribution.

========================

The Judgement:


***** begin judgement *****
True.

Stella?'s interpretation of the rules involved is correct.  

404, having a lower number than 792, does take precedence, and overrules
792's prohibition against the making of proposals.

***** end judgement *****


extraneous comment:

>From this fact can be deduced the following other facts:  Should 404 get
transmuted, 792 will be completely null and void; and should 404 get
amended, 792 will then have a lower number, causing its prohibition on
making proposals past the PL to come into play.  These subtleties are
the reason for the precedence system as it stands:  Conflicting rules can
co-exist in the rule set, peacefully, because a machinery is available to
resolve conflicts.  The younger ones need wait for the powerful elders to
die off, or take steps to demand the power they want.  

I'm glad for the unenforcalble and effectless pphrase in rule 792.  It is
an example of the precedence rules in actionb.


Long live the precedence rules!

Status: OR


I have received the following message from Player Stella?, submitting
165 Proposals.

It appears that my hands are tied, and I must distribute them.

If someone can think of a reason why I shouldn't, I will happily
withdraw them, and begin writing my Formal Apology...

In any case, I *BEG* the Nomic community to cast the same Vote on each
of these (hopefully AGAINST).  Please, please, please don't make me
count up Votes for all 165 of them!!

                        Speaker Garth

-Begin forwarded message here-

Dear Garth,

as Judge Nicol's Ruling of CFJ 135 abolished Proposal Limits I submit
the following list of 165 Proposals already proto-proposed on the server
on April 8. No changes were suggested by the Nomic community and no
changes were made with respect to the Proto-Proposals.

As I don't want you to have extra work just because I like scams I put
the whole list already in the layout you use to distribute proposals.

If somebody else has submitted some proposals before me, I don't oppose
to you cutting out the wrongly numbered proposals and put them back
at the end.

Friendly greetings,
Stella?

The following correction cures a loophole:

Proto-PROPOSAL
Amendment of Rule 865.

The paragraph
   "When proposed in this manner, the Proposer receives 2 Points.
    The Speaker must mention this payment when e distributes the
    Proposal."
shall be replaced by
   "If a proposal is proposed in this manner and if the Proposal is
    adopted, the Proposer receives 2 Points.
    The Speaker must mention this payment when e distributes the
    Voting result for that Proposal."

I don't consider it a loophole, and I am opposed to your cure, in spite of your
recent harassment of the Public Forum with your latest Scam.

The Proposer should receive the protoproposing incentive whether the Proposal
passes of fails.

However, it would be reasonable to change the time at which the proposer
collects the 2 points, to happen simultaneously with the F-A award.

Like this:


proto-proposal
(amends a rule)

Amend Rule 865 by adding the following sentence before the last sentence:

The 2 Points are received at the end of the Voting Period of the Proposal.

Call For Judgement 138

The Judge is Dave Bowen

Caller:         Chuck
Date:           Sun Apr 17 20:42:42 1994

Judge:          Dave Bowen
Date Assigned:  Tue Apr 26 01:12:55 EDT 1994
Date Judged:    Thu, 28 Apr 1994 08:52:19 -0500

Scorekeepor:    Judge Dave Bowen receives 5 points.
                    3 for Judgement within allotted time
                    2 for Judgement within 72 hours

===============

The Statement:

Chuck violated Rule 399 by not posting the Current Ruleset
in the Nomic Week beginning Mon., Mar. 11, 1994 GMT.

Argument:

While it's difficult to prove that something *wasn't* done, consider
that: 1) I admit that I didn't do it, and 2) the Assistant should be
able to confirm that he didn't receive a Current Ruleset during
the week in question.  Those two together should constitute a
proof (as nearly as can be proven) that it wasn't done.

(I have no good excuse for not posting the CR in the week.  I meant
to do it over the weekend, but it turns out that I had a Real Life.
Don't worry, it won't happen again. ;)


Rule 399 (Mutable)
The Office of the Rulekeepor

399.  The Office of the Rulekeepor:

      Let there be an Officer known as the Rulekeepor.
      The Rulekeepor shall maintain a complete list of the current
      Rules, and post this list to all Players at least once a week.
      
      So long as the Rulekeepor is in Office, the Speaker is not
      required to maintain or distribute the Rules.

Rule 459 (Mutable)
The Nomic Week

459.  The Nomic Week

      The Nomic Week begins at midnight, GMT, each Monday. Any
      automatic change in the state of the Game which must occur
      weekly occurs at the beginning of the Nomic Week unless
      otherwise stated in the Rules. Any activity which must occur
      at least weekly must occur at least once each Nomic Week.

==================

The Judgement:

Decision: TRUE

Reasoning: Chuck's arguments are, as usual, quite convincing.  It's difficult
to argue with a person who freely admits his own guilt.  Let the show trials
continue.

X-Sequence: 6190
Status: OR

Stella's proposals are invalid, and shall be removed from consideration. Mighty
Speaker Garth owes us an apology for the error.

Stella's CFJ 135 may be TRUE, but it doesn't apply here. It deals with the fact
that 791, 792, and 843 must defer to 404. 

However, other Rules also come into play here, and they are even higher in
precedence than 404.

Let us look at 843, the Rule which I contend Stella violated:


    843.  Limits On Proposals Sent To Speaker

          No Player may send more than PL/2 Proposals to the Speaker
          during any given Week.  Proposals in excess of this number are
          rejected by the Speaker, as they are not "made in the proper
          manner". A 2 Point penalty is assessed by the Speaker for every
          Proposal submitted in excess of this number; responsibility for
          enforcement is given to the Speaker.


It is true that 404 has higher precedence:


    404.  Legality of Proposals:

          As long as a Proposal satisfies all requirements in place at the
          time of its making for the proper making of Proposals, the act
          of making such a Proposal is legal regardless of its content.
          It is legal to propose a Rule which conflicts with other Rules
          or with itself, which is paradoxical, or which cannot be
          applied.


However, Rule 106 introduces the phrase "proposed in the proper way", which is
used by 843 and several other Rules:


    106.

          All Rule Changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on.
          They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required
          number of votes and Quorum is achieved.

Note that if a Proposal is not proposed in the proper way it need not be voted
on. And by 843, Stella's proposals (or at least all those over his individual
proposal limit) were not proposed in the proper way.

Also, Rule 109 stipulates that the Speaker need not number Proposals which were
not proposed in the proper way:


    109.

          The Speaker shall give each proposed Rule Change a Number for
          reference.  The numbers shall begin with 301, and each Rule
          Change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next
          successive integer, whether or not the Proposal is adopted.
            If a Rule is Repealed and Reenacted, it receives the Number of
          the Proposal to Reenact it.  If a Rule is Amended or Transmuted,
          it receives the Number of the Proposal to Amend or Transmute it.


It seems clear to me that:


* The Great and Mighty Speaker shall retract all of Stella's Proposals in
excess of his individual proposal limit, and apologize for his error.

* Stella gets no protoproposing incentive for all the proposals in excess of
his limit.

* The Score report showing Stella as the winner for the points he received from
protoproposing was incorrect, and must be corrected. 

* Speaker shall assess a 2 Point penalty for each of Stella?'s improperly made
proposal, per 843.


Nice try, Stella, but sorry, won't work. Try again soon?

THE CURRENT RULESET
Part 1 of 6 

Rules are listed as follows, where NNN represents the Rule number:

========================================

Rule NNN (Immutable or Mutable)
My Own Unofficial Title

NNN.  Semi-Official Rule Title, If There Is One

      Text of Rule

Annotation: Some Rules are annotated as required by Rule 789.
These annotations "shall guide the interpretation
of that Rule."
Relevant Rules: Such annotations include a list of relevant Rules.

[Note: Some Rules are annotated by me to clarify their interpretation.
Unlike the official annotations, these are enclosed in brackets.
These annotations have no legal force in and of themselves.]

========================================



========================================

Rule 101 (Immutable)
Obey the Rules

101.

      All Players must always abide by all the Rules then in effect,
      in the form in which they are then in effect.  The Rules in the
      Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the first game.
      The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (Immutable) and
      201-219 (Mutable).

========================================

Rule 102 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Rules

102.

      Initially Rules in the 100's are Immutable and Rules in the
      200's are Mutable.  Rules subsequently Enacted or Transmuted
      (that is, changed from Immutable to Mutable or vice versa) may
      be Immutable or Mutable regardless of their Numbers, and Rules
      in the Initial Set may be Transmuted regardless of their Numbers.

========================================

Rule 103 (Immutable)
The Speaker and Voters

103.

      At any time, each Player shall be either a Voter or the Speaker;
      no Player may simultaneously be a Voter and a Speaker. At any
      time, there shall be exactly one Speaker. The term "Player" in
      the Rules shall specifically include both the Voters and the
      Speaker.

========================================

Rule 104 (Immutable)
First Speaker

104.

      The Speaker for the first game shall be Michael Norrish.

========================================

Rule 105 (Immutable)
What Is a Rule Change?

105.

      A Rule Change is any of the following:  (1) the enactment,
      repeal, or amendment of a mutable Rule; or (2) the transmutation
      of an immutable Rule into a mutable Rule or vice versa.
        (Note:  This definition implies that, at least initially, all
      new Rules are Mutable; Immutable Rules, as long as they are
      Immutable, may not be Amended or Repealed; Mutable Rules, as long
      as they are Mutable, may be Amended or Repealed; any Rule of any
      status may be Transmuted; no Rule is absolutely immune to change.)

========================================

Rule 106 (Immutable)
Adopting Proposed Rule Changes

106.

      All Rule Changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on.
      They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required
      number of votes and Quorum is achieved.

========================================

Rule 107 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Must Be Written Down

107.

      Any proposed Rule Change must be written down (or otherwise
      communicated in print media) before it is voted on. If adopted,
      it must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.

========================================

Rule 108 (Immutable)
When May Rule Changes Take Effect?

108.

      No Rule Change may take effect earlier than the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording
      explicitly states otherwise.  No rule change may have retroactive
      application.

========================================

Rule 109 (Immutable)
Rule Numbers

109.

      The Speaker shall give each proposed Rule Change a Number for
      reference.  The numbers shall begin with 301, and each Rule
      Change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next
      successive integer, whether or not the Proposal is adopted.
        If a Rule is Repealed and Reenacted, it receives the Number of
      the Proposal to Reenact it.  If a Rule is Amended or Transmuted,
      it receives the Number of the Proposal to Amend or Transmute it.
 
========================================

Rule 110 (Immutable)
Transmutation of Rules

110.

      Rule Changes that Transmute Immutable Rules into Mutable Rules
      may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among Votes
      legally cast.  Transmutation shall not be implied, but must be
      stated explicitly in a Proposal to take effect.
 
========================================

Rule 111 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Conflicts

111.

      In a conflict between a Mutable and an Immutable Rule, the
      immutable Rule takes precedence and the Mutable Rule shall be
      entirely void.  For the purposes of this Rule a Proposal to
      Transmute an Immutable Rule does not "conflict" with that
      Immutable Rule.
 
========================================

Rule 112 (Immutable)
Winning Must Be by Points

112.

      The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered
      from achieving n points to any other state of affairs.  The
      magnitude of n and the means of earning points may be changed,
      and Rules that establish a Winner when play cannot continue may
      be Enacted and (while they are mutable) be Amended or Repealed.
 
========================================

Rule 113 (Immutable)
Players May Always Forfeit

113.

      A Player always has the option to forfeit the Game rather than
      continue to play or incur a Game penalty.  No penalty worse than
      losing, in the judgment of the Player to incur it, may be
      imposed.

========================================

Rule 114 (Immutable)
At Least One Mutable Rule

114.

      There must always be at least one Mutable Rule.  The adoption of
      Rule Changes must never become completely inpermissible.

========================================

Rule 115 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Which Change Rule-Changing Rules Allowed

115.

      Rule Changes that affect Rules needed to allow or apply
      Rule Changes are as permissible as other Rule Changes.  Even
      Rule Changes that amend or repeal their own authority are
      permissible.  No Rule Change or type of move is impermissible
      solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a
      Rule.

========================================

Rule 116 (Immutable)
Permissibility of the Unprohibited

116.

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
      and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
      which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly or
      implicitly permits it.

========================================

Rule 206 (Mutable)
One Voter, One Vote

206.

      Each Voter has exactly one Vote.  The Speaker may not Vote.

========================================

Rule 208 (Mutable)
End of the Voting Period

208.

      At the end of the prescribed Voting Period on a Proposal, the
      Speaker shall reveal all Votes legally cast on that Proposal. If
      the Speaker's consent may be required for a Proposal to be
      adopted then the Speaker should indicate at that time whether or
      not e gives eir consent.  If the Speaker does not explicitly
      indicate that e refuses to consent to the Proposal, it shall be
      assumed that e consents.

========================================

Rule 212 (Mutable)
Resolving Rule Conflicts

212.

      If two or more Mutable Rules conflict with one another, or if
      two or more Immutable Rules conflict with one another, then the
      Rule with the lowest ordinal Number takes precedence.
        If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of rule) or takes
      precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.
        If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

========================================

Rule 217 (Mutable)
Judgements Must Accord with the Rules

217.

      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however, if
      the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the Statement
      to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider Game Custom and the
      Spirit of the Game before applying other standards.

========================================

Rule 312 (Mutable)
A Point for Voting

312.

      If a Voter votes, he gets one (1) point at the end of the Voting
      Period.

========================================

Rule 376 (Mutable)
When Does a Rule Change Take Effect?

376.  Time that a rule change takes effect:

      An adopted rule change takes full effect at the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it.
      The moment of the completion of the vote is defined by the date
      and time given in the line starting with "Date:" of the Nomic
      listserver message send by the Benevolent Speaker, announcing
      the result of the vote on the corresponding proposal.

========================================

Rule 388 (Mutable)
Game Status When a New Game Begins

388.  Starting a new Game:

      Whenever a new game of Nomic is begun, the status of the new
      Game when it begins shall be the same as the status of the old
      Game when it ended, in all respects where the Rules do not
      decide otherwise.

========================================

Rule 399 (Mutable)
The Office of the Rulekeepor

399.  The Office of the Rulekeepor:

      Let there be an Officer known as the Rulekeepor.
      The Rulekeepor shall maintain a complete list of the current
      Rules, and post this list to all Players at least once a week.
      
      So long as the Rulekeepor is in Office, the Speaker is not
      required to maintain or distribute the Rules.

========================================

Rule 402 (Mutable)
Transfer of Power of the Mighty Speaker

402.  Transfer of Power of the Mighty Speaker:

      When one Mighty Speaker is yielding his Office to another, the
      following procedure shall be followed:
      
       1) The Present Mighty Speaker shall forward copies of all
          necessary materials for the performance of his Office to the
          Prospective Mighty Speaker.
       2) The Prospective Mighty Speaker shall acknowledge the receipt
          of said materials.
       3) The Present Mighty Speaker shall post a message to the
          listserv announcing the official transfer of power, which
          occurs at the "Date:" of the Present Mighty Speaker's
          posting.
      
      The Present Mighty Speaker remains in Office until the successful
      completion of step 3.

========================================

Rule 404 (Mutable)
Legality of Proposals

404.  Legality of Proposals:

      As long as a Proposal satisfies all requirements in place at the
      time of its making for the proper making of Proposals, the act
      of making such a Proposal is legal regardless of its content.
      It is legal to propose a Rule which conflicts with other Rules
      or with itself, which is paradoxical, or which cannot be
      applied.

========================================

Rule 407 (Mutable)
Invoking Judgement

407.  Clerk of the Courts, Part II: Invoking Judgement:

      If Players disagree about the legality of a Move or the
      interpretation or application of a Rule, then a Player may
      invoke Judgement by submitting a Statement for Judgement to the
      Clerk of the Courts.  Disagreement, for the purposes of this
      Rule, may be created by the insistence of any Player.  When
      Judgement is invoked, the Clerk of the Courts must, as soon as
      possible, select a Judge as described in the Rules.  The Clerk
      of the Courts must then distribute the Statement to be judged,
      along with the identity of the Judge, to all Players.

========================================

Rule 408 (Mutable)
Accepting Judge-ship

408.  Clerk of the Courts, Part III: Accepting Judge-ship:

      After the Clerk of the Courts has distributed the Statement to
      be judged and the identity of the Judge, the Judge has one week
      in which to deliver a legal Judgement.  If the Judge fails to
      deliver a Judgement within this time, e is penalized 10 points
      and a new Judge is selected.  A Judgement is delivered by
      submitting that Judgement to the Clerk of the Courts, who must
      then distribute that Judgement to all Players as soon as
      possible.

========================================

Rule 413 (Mutable)
Winning by Paradox

413.  Winning By Paradox:

      If the Rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or
      if the legality of some action cannot be determined with
      finality, or if some action appears equally legal and illegal,
      then a player may Call For Judgement on a Statement to that
      effect.  If the Statement is judged TRUE, then the same Judge
      who judged the Statement TRUE must declare the most recent
      passed Proposal X such that the Statement was not TRUE before
      the passage of Proposal X, or declare that there is no such
      Proposal.  (Until the Judge does this, the Judgment is not
      valid.)  If the Judgement of TRUE is not overruled, then the
      Player who called for Judgement is declared the Winner of the
      game.
      
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared that
      there is no such Proposal X, the game is ended, with no
      provisions for restarting it.
      
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared such
      a Proposal X, the following actions are taken:
         - all Players remain active,
         - all Proposals curently being Voted upon are removed from
           consideration for Voting,
         - the scores for all Players are set to 0 (zero),
         - the Rules and explicit game custom are reverted to the
           state they were in before Proposal X was passed,
         - a Benevolent Speaker for the next Game is chosen:
              -If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the
               Benevolent Speaker, and the old Benevolent Speaker
               becomes a Voter,
              -If there is more than one Winner, the Benevolent
               Speaker randomly selects one of the Winners, who
               becomes the new Benevolent Speaker, and the old
               Benevolent Speaker becomes a Voter,
         - and a new Game is begun.

========================================

Rule 415 (Mutable)
How To Submit a Proposal

415.  "How a Proposal is Submitted":

      A Proposal by a Voter shall be made by submitting it to the
      Mighty Speaker. As soon as possible after receiving the
      Proposal, the Mighty Speaker shall assign the Proposal a Number
      and distribute the Proposal along with its number to all
      Players.
      
      The Mighty Speaker may also make Proposals. The Mighty Speaker
      must process all pending Voter-submitted Proposals first, and
      may then Process Proposals of the Mighty Speaker, assigning
      these Proposals a number and distributing them in the same
      fashion as any other Proposal.

========================================

Rule 417 (Mutable)
The Nomic Archivist

417.  Establishment of the Office of Archivist:

      That there be established an office known as the Nomic
      Archivist, which shall be governed by the default Rules
      concerning official posts. The initial duties of the Nomic
      Archivist shall be to record the passage and failure of
      Proposals, to maintain a "historical record" (defined below)
      of the Ruleset, to maintain a list of Judgements and their case
      histories, and to maintain a list of game Winners in past games.
      The Archivist is free to comment on the historical records as
      they see fit, but such commentary must be clearly delimited
      from the historical material. Where the material being stored
      does not already admit a classification method, the Archivist
      is free to design one themselves.

      The "historical record" of the Ruleset maintained by the
      Archivist is one that includes all rules ever part of the nomic
      Ruleset, annotated with information as to their ultimate fate,
      whether Repealed or Amended etc. This record of the Ruleset has
      no legal force.

      The duties required of the Archivist may be changed with their
      consent and at the request of the Office's controlling body
      (whatsoever that may be). Initially, the controlling body of
      this Office shall be all Players, and any request to change the
      duties must therefore be supported by a majority of Players
      "speaking" to the request.  Naturally, default Rules for
      Offices may establish a different controlling body for this
      Office.
      
      The salary of the Archivist office shall be determined by its
      controlling body. Initially, its salary shall be 5 points and
      one coin of the office-holder's group per week.
      
      The initial office-holder for this post shall be Michael
      Norrish.

========================================

Rule 434 (Mutable)
Game May Be Won By CFJ

434.  Judgement Required to Win (and Timing of Win):

      If a Player believes that he has won the Game, he may submit a
      CFJ to that effect.  If it is returned with the Judgement TRUE
      (and that Judgement is not Appealed), then he has won the Game
      as of the delivery of that Judgement.  If the Judgement is TRUE,
      but is Appealed, but is sustained (and no Proposal to reverse
      the verdict is made), then he has won the Game as of the
      delivery of the Appeal verdict.  If such a verdict is sustained,
      challenged by Proposal, but the Proposal does not pass, he has
      won the Game as of the completion of the Vote on that Proposal.

      Judgement on a CFJ to win the Game may *not* be delivered until
      at least 72 hours after its official announcement, in order to
      give time for the Judge to accept input from the community.

      This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which specifies
      the exact moment at which a Game is won.

[Note: Implicit Game Custom dictates that, despite the title,
this rule does not *require* a CFJ in order to win the game.]

========================================

Rule 450 (Mutable)
Game Entities May Not Be Arbitrarily Changed

450.  Game Entities may not be Arbitrarily Changed:

      Any Entity which is created by the Nomic Rules, and which exists only
      within the context of the current Game of Nomic, such as Points,
      Votes, etc. may *not* be changed by any action other than those
      specified by the Rules.

========================================

Rule 451 (Mutable)
Determination of Judgement--Timing

451.  Timing of CFJ Results:

      When a CFJ makes a Statement about the current state of the
      Game, the result of that CFJ shall be TRUE if and only if the
      Judge feels that that Statement was correct at the time that the
      CFJ was *issued*. Any changes that have happened in the time
      between the issuing of the CFJ and its delivery must be figured
      in to find the correct current state.

========================================

Rule 452 (Mutable)
Prohibition of Electioneering by the Mighty Speaker

452.  Prohibition of Electioneering by the Mighty Speaker:

      The Speaker may not use eis knowledge of the current status of a
      vote on a Proposal in an attempt to influence the result of the
      Vote on that Proposal. Violations of this Rule shall be
      considered a Class C Crime.

      A Player is defined as the Recordkeepor for a Currency if e is
      required to keep an accurate record of the number of that
      Currency owned by each player and non-player Nomic entity which
      is permitted to own that Currency.

663.  General Rules For Injunctions

      There shall be an entity known as an Injunction, which may
      accompany certain Judgements of TRUE or FALSE as provided in the
      rules. An Injunction is a statement or series of statements
      specifying an action or actions which must take place. If a
      Judgement is is accompanied by an Injunction, that Injunction
      must be published with the Judgement. All players must abide by
      the Injunction beginning no later than 72 hours after its
      publication unless one of the following conditions then apply:
        - The Judgement which the Injunction accompanies is undergoing
          appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of the appeal
          process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but a proposal
          has been published which would overturn that decision if
          passed, and said proposal has not failed.
        - The validity of the Injunction itself is questioned by a
          pending CFJ.
        - A Judgement upholding the validity of the Injunction is
          undergoing appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of
          the appeal process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but
          a proposal has been published which would overturn that
          decision if passed, and said proposal has not failed.

      A Judgement may not be accompanied by an Injunction unless it is
      specifically permitted elsewhere in the rules. An Injunction
      must be completely consistent with all rules in effect at the
      time of issuance, and must be completely relevant to the matter
      addressed in the corresponding judgement.

      If any Player believes that an Injunction or any part of it does
      not meet the criteria for a valid Injunction, e may submit a CFJ
      to that effect. If the resulting Judgement supports the
      contention that the criteria are not met, the Injunction shall
      be considered illegal and shall have no legal force.

      This rule takes precedence over all rules governing Injunctions.

========================================

      the Judgement an Injunction specifying that the move is to be
      retracted, and any resulting adjustments to the published game
      state. The adjustments to the game state must have been
      unambiguously specified within the CFJ, and these adjustments
      must only undo actions which were a direct or indirect result of
      that Move.

      registered in the Game, and G is the number of Games which
      Player X has already won.  If more than one Voter achieves this

          Speaker and the old Speaker becomes a Voter.
        - If there is more than one Winner, the Voter with the highest Point 
          total becomes the new Speaker.  If more than one Voter is

          one of them to become the new Speaker.  The old Speaker
          becomes a voter.
        - All Player's scores are reset to 0.

The Marxist

736.  The Marxist

      Let there be the Patent Title known as "Marxist", which is
      awarded to the Player with the most Marks, or if tied, to the
      Players with the most Marks. Only the current richest Player
      or Players may hold this title.

      The determination and announcement of assignment and revoking
      of the Title is made by the Banker, who must use the most
      accurate means of determining this available to eim, and must
      make the announcement as soon as possible after becoming aware
      of a change in holder of the Title.

      However: To respect some Players' wish for privacy, and in
      view of the secret nature of Marks accounts, a prospective
      Marxist must first be asked if e wants the Title. If not, then
      instead of announcing, "Player x is granted the Patent Title of
      'Marxist', e announces, "Patent Title of 'Marxist' is granted
       to an anonymous Player".

      Quantity is given to an Entity, and no Rule states where that
      Conserved Quantity is to be taken from, then the transfer shall
      not take place. If a Conserved Quantity is taken from an Entity,

      Once the identity of the Auctioneer is determined, the Auction
      begins with the Auctioneer making an announcement to the game
      forum stating what  Nomic entity is up for Auction, and that e
      is accepting bids.
 
      Players who wish to participate in the Auction then must
      indicate their interest by sending a bid to the Auctioneer.

Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal

761.  Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal: Adjusting for Abstentions

      When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the Votes which
      have been legally cast shall be counted by the Speaker. If a
      Proposal is not Contested, and there are more FOR votes cast
      then AGAINST votes, then that Proposal shall take effect.  If
      such a Proposal has an equal number of FOR and AGAINST Votes,
      then the Speaker shall decide whether the Proposal shall be
      Adopted, or if that Proposal shall fail. If the Proposal is
      Contested, and the number of FOR votes cast is at least twice
      the number of AGAINST votes cast, then that Proposal shall take
      effect.

      If a Rule will change the actions required of or forbidden to
      the Speaker, and the Speaker opposed the Proposal, then that
      Proposal shall be considered Contested. The Speaker shall
      declare if e opposes the Proposal when e distributes the

      Treasury as specified in the Y Ordinances.  If the Y Ordinances
      are silent on this issue, or if Group Y has ceased to exist,

      downwards, shall be transferred to Player X, where N is the
      number of Members of Group Y immediately before Player X ceased
      to be a Member of Group Y.  This transfer is not taxable, and

Rule 764 (Mutable)
Mischief

764.  Mischief

      Any Player or Group X may perform an Act of Mischief directed
      at any Player or Group Y.  The permissible forms of Mischief
      are defined in other Rules; such definitions must include a 
      positive Price in Coins, or the form of Mischief is not
      permissible.  This Rule explicitly takes precedence over all
      other Rules which purport to determine which forms of Mischief
      are permissible.

      To cause an Act of Mischief,  X  sends to the Public Forum a
      message containing:
      - the Name of the object, Y;
      - the effect of the Act of Mischief;
      - the Number of the Rule which permits the form of Mischief;
      - indication of which Coins in X's account will be used as
      payment for the Act of Mischief.  Coins of Group Y, or the
      Group to which Player Y belongs, may not be used as payment.  

      The effect of the Act of Mischief is applied immediately upon 
      publication of the above message in the Forum.  An additional
      effect of this Act of Mischief is that
      - for each Coin of Group Z spent as payment above, two Points
      are removed from the Z Treasury;
      - the Coins used as payment above are removed from X's account
      and destroyed.

Rule 766 (Mutable)
Groups

766.  Amend Rule 714.

      A Group is initially formed by a set of Players which has
      registered with the Registrar to form a Group; other Players may
      join later.  Each Group has a Name, a Membership, a Vizier,
      an Ordinancekeepor, a Treasury, an Initial Set of Ordinances,
      and an associated form of Currency, called the <name> Coins,
      where <name> is the Name of the Group.

      1.  The Name may not be the Name of another Group.

      2.  The Membership is a set of Players;  these Players are
      Members of the Group, and all other Players are not.

      3.  Synchronously with the registration of a Group, two Offices
      are created known as the <name> Vizier, and the <name>
      Ordinancekeepor, where <name> is the Name of the Group.
      These Offices may never be empty, and the <name> Vizier and
      <name> Ordinancekeepor must both be a member of <name> Group.
      The <name> Vizier shall inform the Registrar whenever the
      Membership or the Ordinancekeepor of the <name> group changes.
      When the <name> Vizier changes, the new Vizier shall inform the
      Registrar of the change.
      The <name> Ordinancekeepor shall keep an accurate and current
      record of the Ordinances of the <name> Group.

      4.  The Treasury is a repository for Points and Currencies and
      has the same capabilities for holding, trading, and spending
      Points and Currencies as does a Player.

      5.  The Ordinances are a description of the operation of the
      Group.

      6.  The <name> Coins are a form of Currency which is created
      synchronously with the registration of the Group.  The <name>
      Group may create <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be
      placed in the <name> Treasury.  The <name> Group may destroy
      <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be removed from the
      <name> Treasury.

Votes for Groups

767.  Amend Rule 646.

      If a Group has N Members then it has N Votes for each
      Proposal in addition to those of its Membership.  The
      Ordinances of a Group may determine how and when the Group
      casts its Votes; if the Ordinances are silent on this issue
      then the Group may not cast its Votes.  The Votes of the
      Group are cast when the Vizier sends a message to the Speaker
      to that effect during the Voting Period and this action is
      legitimate insofar as the Ordinances are concerned.

Sanity

      When a Player submits a Proposal, e may pay one Mark to the Bank
      (if e has at least one Mark) and impose Sanity on that Proposal.
      E must inform both the Banker and the Speaker when doing so.
      A Proposal which has Sanity imposed upon it is known as a Sane
      Proposal.  The Speaker shall, when e distributes a Sane
      Proposal, inform the Players that it is a Sane Proposal.

      No non-Voter Nomic entity may Vote on a Sane Proposal.  Each
      Voter shall have exactly one Vote on a Sane Proposal, and
      each Voter's Vote shall be counted exactly once on a Sane
      Proposal.

      This rule takes precedence over any rule allowing a non-Voter
      Nomic entity to Vote; over any rule which gives any Voter
      more or less than one Vote on a proposal; and over any
      rule which would cause any Voter's Vote to be counted more or
      less than once.

      acted or has failed to act in such a way as to be in violation
      of one or more Rules, and this CFJ is Judged TRUE, then the
      Judge must issue an Injunction that the Ninny submit a Formal
      Apology.  This Injunction may also include a list of up to ten
      Prescribed Words.  By a Formal Apology is meant a letter of at
      least 200 words, containing all of the Prescribed Words,
      explaining the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
      for self-improvement, and posted in the Public Forum.  Within 48
      hours of the posting of this Formal Apology, the Squealer must
      either submit a Proposal that the Ninny's Apology be accepted,
      or submit a Proposal that the Ninny's Aplology be rejected,
      but not both.  No other Player may submit such a Proposal, and
      the Squealer may submit only one.  If a Proposal to accept the
      Apology fails, or if a Proposal to reject the Apology passes,
      then the Ninny loses 5 Points.

Abandonment of Speakerhood

785.  Improve Speaker Succession I

      If the Speaker has abandoned eir post, another new, Temporary
      Speaker is selected according to the "Rules of Succession", or
      if no such rules are defined, the other Player not on hold with
      the highest Score becomes the temporary Speaker.  This does not
      force the Game to be over in this case, and Scores are not reset
      to 0. The Game continues until a Player Wins, at which time a
      new Game is begun and the Winner becomes the real Speaker. The
      Temporary Speaker shall make reasonable effort to obtain the
      former Speaker's materials: proposal queue, voting records, etc.
      but if this is not possible, then the Temporary Speaker shall
      request that these be resubmitted by the Players. If a Speaker
      is replaced in this manner, e has eir score set to minus 2N
      Points immediately, where N is the number of Points required for
      a Player to Win the Game.

      Abandonment is determined as follows: If any Player suspects
      that the Speaker has Abandoned, e sends a message to all Players
      calling on the Speaker to announce eir presence.  The Speaker
      must reply to all Players within one week; if e does not, e is
      considered to have Abandoned.

      Rules relevant to that CFJ, which must include the Rule in
      question.  If the statement is Judged TRUE, the Judge may

         same committed act, unless the last such Accusation has been
         judged UNDECIDED.
        -The following exception takes precedence over previous Rules 
         concerning Judgement: Neither Accusing nor Accused Player may
         act as Judge for the Accusation; in any case where this would
         occur, a random Voter, neither Accuser nor Accused, shall be
         Judge.
      If the Statement is judged TRUE, the Accused Player has been
      found Guilty of breaking the Rule or committing the Crime, as
      applicable.  If the Statement is judged FALSE, the Accused
      Player has been found Not Guilty of breaking the Rule or

      If a Player believes that any Player has not abided by a Rule
      then in effect, in the form in which it was then in effect, then
      the Player may invoke Judgement on a Statement to that effect.
      Similarly, if a Player believes that any Player has commited a
      Crime, e may invoke Judgement on a Statement to that effect.
      Either kind of Statement is known as an Accusation.  A Criminal
      Court is defined as the Judge of an Accusation.
      However,
        -The Accusing player immediately loses 5 points.
        -No Player may be so Accused of actions committed before the
         adoption of this Rule or more than 30 days before the
         Accusation.
        -No Player may be so Accused more than once concerning the
         same committed act, unless the last such Accusation has been
         judged UNDECIDED.
        -The following exception takes precedence over previous Rules 
         concerning Judgement: Neither Accusing nor Accused Player may
         act as Judge for the Accusation; in any case where this would
         occur, a random Voter, neither Accuser nor Accused, shall be
         Judge.
      If the Statement is judged TRUE, the Accused Player has been
      found Guilty of breaking the Rule or committing the Crime, as
      applicable.  If the Statement is judged FALSE, the Accused
      Player has been found Not Guilty of breaking the Rule or
      committing the Crime, as applicable.

      many FOR Votes as AGAINST Votes in order to pass.  This

      Rules relevant to that CFJ, which must include the Rule in
      question.  If the statement is Judged TRUE, the Judge may

      in the list of relevant Rules is amended, repealed, or
      transmuted; or until a CFJ determines that the injunction no
      longer applies, as described below.  While it remains, it shall
      guide the application of that Rule.

Rule 846 (Mutable)
No Double Jeopardy

846.  Criminal Double Jeapordy

      A Player may only be found Guilty once for a particular instance
      of a particular Crime. If a Player admits to being Guilty while
      a Criminal Court is in session to find that Player Guilty, e
      shall suffer the penalties as if e had been found Guilty by a
      Criminal Court. If a Player admits to being Guilty before
      Criminal Court has been called, then a Criminal Court shall not
      be called for that instance of that Crime, and the Player shall
      suffer any penalties for committing the Crime.  This Rule takes
      precedence over other Rules that define when a Criminal Court
      should be called.

Rule 848 (Mutable)
Determining When a Rule Has Been Broken

848.  Determining when a Rule has been broken:

      If a Player believes that any Player has not abided by a Rule
      then in effect, in the form in which it was then in effect, then
      the Player may invoke Judgement on a Statement to that effect.
      Similarly, if a Player believes that any Player has commited a
      Crime, e may invoke Judgement on a Statement to that effect.
      Either kind of Statement is known as an Accusation.  A Criminal
      Court is defined as the Judge of an Accusation.
      However,
        -The Accusing player immediately loses 5 points.
        -No Player may be so Accused of actions committed before the
         adoption of this Rule or more than 30 days before the
         Accusation.
        -No Player may be so Accused more than once concerning the
         same committed act, unless the last such Accusation has been
         judged UNDECIDED.
        -The following exception takes precedence over previous Rules 
         concerning Judgement: Neither Accusing nor Accused Player may
         act as Judge for the Accusation; in any case where this would
         occur, a random Voter, neither Accuser nor Accused, shall be
         Judge.
      If the Statement is judged TRUE, the Accused Player has been
      found Guilty of breaking the Rule or committing the Crime, as
      applicable.  If the Statement is judged FALSE, the Accused
      Player has been found Not Guilty of breaking the Rule or
      committing the Crime, as applicable.

Mandatory Actions Are Never Crimes

852.  Mandatory actions are not crimes

Oaths

853.  Code of honor

      In order to make an Oath, a Player must send a message
      to at least one other Player, stating the fact that they
      are making an Oath, and what the Oath is.

      If someone makes an Oath, e must do that which e has sworn
      to do, as long as it is legal for em to do so.

      E who defies this has broken this Rule, and shall also be guilty
      of a Class C Crime.

      No rule may force someone to make an Oath;
      this rule takes precedence over all rules that attempt to do so.

========================================

      Any Proposal which introduces a new way to Create or Destroy
      a Conserved Quantity shall require at least three times as
      many FOR Votes as AGAINST Votes in order to pass.  This
      restriction does not apply to Proposals which define new
      Conserved Quantities or Create the initial stock of a new
      Conserved Quantity.

[CFJ 128 determined that this Rule has no force, as it conflicts
with Rule 761.]

      the message announcing the voting results.

      * All point changes resulting from fees for judgements, salaries
      and penalties given to judges: responsibility of Clerk of the
      Courts, who must report these as soon as possible, and no later
      than the message announcing the outcome of the judgement.

      * Electioneer per-position-filled salary: responsibility of
      Electioneer to notify Scorekeepor within one Week.

      * Point changes regarding the "Squealer/Ninny" Rule: If the
      Ninny must lose Points, the responsibility lies with the

      * Stock dividends: responsibility of the Banker for notifying

      The Scorekeepor notification must be via the public forum or, if
      individually subscribable distribution lists are implemented,
      must be made on a distribution list which is potentially
      available to anyone who wishes to subscribe to it.  This
      paragraph takes precendence over other Rules which would require
      a private Scorekeepor notification. The notification need not be
      on a separate message, as long as the Scorekeepor is mentioned,
      and the message is on a list which is received by the
      Scorekeepor.

      Other classes of Point changes whose legal responsibilty for
      reporting is other than the Scorekeepor may be defined by other
      Rules.

Call For Judgement 140

The Judge is Michael

Caller:         Stella?
Date:           Fri, 29 Apr 94 10:37:42 SET

Judge:          Michael
Date Assigned:  Fri Apr 29 08:41:31 EDT 1994

=================

The Statement:

"Whereas, no CFJ that questioned the score report of 22 April was
          judged TRUE, meaning that those scores shall be considered to
          be the accurate and actual scores for the Game (463);
 whereas, these scores (all Players zero Points because the Game was
          won by the Abelian Group) without any doubt were not
          according to the Rules;
 whereas, the Scorekeepor shall abide by all Rules governing score (901);
 therefore,
          the action of the Scorekeepor to update the scores starting
          from zero scores for the Players on 22 April appears to be
          equally legal and illegal."

Arguments:

[Note that if this CFJ is Judged TRUE *all* Proposals currently
being voted upon have to be removed from consideration, so that
Stella? does not win a game on points!

Note that if this CFJ is judged TRUE Stella? wins the game by Rule 413,
while if it is Judged FALSE or UNDECIDED, the scorekeepor is
obliged to tabulate scores starting from the disastrous but unquestioned
score report of 22 April.]

The score report of 22 April announced that the game was won by the
Abelian Group implying that the Players scores were to be reset to
zero. It was established quickly that the Scorekeepor had erred in
his reasoning.
Hence, in accordance with Rule 463 a CFJ was issued claiming that
the scores were in error (CFJ 139).

In agreement with the same Rule this CFJ stated what were thought
to be the correct scores. (Note that 463 does not state that these
score corrections should be in accordance with the Rules!)
As in this CFJ a player was attributed 10000 Points (a Freudian
slip no doubt) the Judge judged the statement FALSE.

However, as no other CFJ questioned the score report, these scores
have to be considered correct! (Again Rule 463.)

This means that the Scorekeepor has the legal obligation to
restart counting from these scores, which by the the Rules are
illegal.

In other words:
it appears that the action of starting with the scores from 22/4
is equally legal and illegal.
A paradox!

I object!!  That provision applies only to players who default on judgement,

protoproposal XXX (KoJen) {Proto-Proposed 04/29/94}
The Social Contract
(what annotation do I use here?)

Let there be an entity known as a Social Contract. A Social Contract
is created in the same way as a Rule. The required adoption ratio is
2:1, and such a proposal is automatically Sane. The Rulekeepor shall
keep track of Social Contracts and publish them with the Rule
Set. However, they shall be clearly marked as a Social Contract so as
not to be confused with a Rule.

A Social Contract is treated like a Rule for all purposes except one:
A Social Contract is not *required* to obeyed. However, a Social
Contract *should* be obeyed. One who disobeys a Social Contract risks
being ostracised from the Friendly Community of Agora Nomic, until e
has paid for eir violation to the satifcation of the Community.

The legal declartion for a Social Contract is: "Create a Social
Contract". 

[Justification: Provides a means to establish and record conventions
which are understood to go beyond the Rules, for the purpose of making
Agora a friendlier and more stable place.]

Chuck, you are correct.  I misread rule 890 (Selecting a Judge).  A
re-examination of that rule has clarified this for me.
