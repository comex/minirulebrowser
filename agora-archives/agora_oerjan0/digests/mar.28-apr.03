CFJ: Chuck  Mar. 7 13:48:38 GMT-6
Judge: Dave Nicol  Mar 23 00:27:57
Judgement:  Mar 26 02:55:33


Statement:

Rule 825 has no legal force in the current Ruleset.
Relevant Rules: 825, 106, 761, 376, 212, 201


Judgement: TRUE


Argument: [Chuck]

Rule 825 attempts to limit the effects of a proposal which would
have effects based on events which took place before passage of
that proposal.  (Note that 825 does *not*, in any case, affect the
passage of such a proposal.)  This is in conflict with Rule 376,
which states that a proposal takes full effect as soon as it is
adopted.  Neither 376 nor 825 claims to take precedence over or
defer to the other; thus by Rule 212, 376 takes precedence.  Such
a proposal as mentioned in Rule 825 *does* take full effect on
its adoption (376), and the votes required to adopt such a proposal
are defined in Rule 761.  Rule 106 states that a Rule is adopted
if it meets quorum (defined in 201) and receives the required number
of votes.

So for such a proposal (if it passes): proposal meets quorum (201)
and proposal receives required number of votes (761) ==> proposal
is adopted (106) ==> proposal takes effect as soon as the Speaker
reports it. (376)

Note that this CFJ alleges a certain interpretation of a Rule,
and, if Judged TRUE, the Judge may issue an Injunction of the
sort described in Rule 789.


Relevant Rules:


Rule 825 (Mutable)
Unanimous Vote Required for Effects Based on Past

825.  Vote AGAINST Without Recrimination

      Proposals may affect the game when the effect/s is based on
      votes or activities before the passage of said Proposal only if
      said Proposal was passed unanimously.

      For the purpose of this Rule, Proposals that are passed without
      receiving any AGAINST votes are considered to be unanimous.

Rule 106 (Immutable)
Adopting Proposed Rule Changes

106.

      All Rule Changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on.
      They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required
      number of votes and Quorum is achieved.

Rule 761 (Mutable)
Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal

761.  Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal: Adjusting for Abstentions

      When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the Votes which
      have been legally cast shall be counted by the Speaker. If a
      Proposal is not Contested, and there are more FOR votes cast
      then AGAINST votes, then that Proposal shall take effect.  If
      such a Proposal has an equal number of FOR and AGAINST Votes,
      then the Speaker shall decide whether the Proposal shall be
      Adopted, or if that Proposal shall fail. If the Proposal is
      Contested, and the number of FOR votes cast is at least twice
      the number of AGAINST votes cast, then that Proposal shall take
      effect.

      If a Rule will change the actions required of or forbidden to
      the Speaker, and the Speaker opposed the Proposal, then that
      Proposal shall be considered Contested. The Speaker shall
      declare if e opposes the Proposal when e distributes the
      Proposal.
      (*Was: 658*)

Rule 376 (Mutable)
When Does a Rule Change Take Effect?

376.  Time that a rule change takes effect:

      An adopted rule change takes full effect at the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it.
      The moment of the completion of the vote is defined by the date
      and time given in the line starting with "Date:" of the Nomic
      listserver message send by the Benevolent Speaker, announcing
      the result of the vote on the corresponding proposal.


Rule 201 (Mutable)
Quorum

201.

      Quorum for a proposed Rule Change is defined to be 20% of Voters
      at the beginning of the prescribed Voting Period for that
      Proposal.

Rule 212 (Mutable)
Resolving Rule Conflicts

212.

      If two or more Mutable Rules conflict with one another, or if
      two or more Immutable Rules conflict with one another, then the
      Rule with the lowest ordinal Number takes precedence.
        If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of rule) or takes
      precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.
        If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.


Reasons and Arguments: [Dave Nicol]

Rule 825 clearly requires a precedence claim, which, as
quoted in the CFJ argument, it clearly lacks.

I do not think an injunction is required to be attached to rule 825,
as it would make the ruleset even bulkier.

CFJ: Garth  Mar. 21 13:50:28 GMT-8
Judge: KoJen  Mar 23 00:27:39
Judgement:  Mar 25 16:28:38


Statement:

The Foreign Policy Directive instated by Proposal 861 is without
legal force.


Judgement: FALSE


Argument: [Garth]

Proposal 861 purports to be a Foreign Policy Directive (FPD),
yet Rule 809 defines a FPD as a Proposal that directs the Ambassador on
how to handle "a single piece of Foreign Policy business."  Proposal 861,
however, purports to require the Ambassador to give Points *whenever* a
Nomic is found.  Further, since giving Points is not a piece of Foreign
Policy, it cannot be enforced by a FPD.  Remember, a FPD is not a Rule!

Request to the Judge:  I request an Injunction forbidding any Point 
transfers based on Proposal 861.  (Yes, that includes Point transfers to
*me*, as well.  861 has no power to do any such thing.)

::


Reasons and Arguments: [KoJen]

Garth's argument is really stretching reasonable interpretation of
rather clear English language beyond all sensibility. By a "single piece of
Foreign Policy business", I understand this to mean, a "single type of
business". One such type is locating other Games on the internet.

I would write more, but I have to run, and wanted to get this out before the
weekend. 

I'll be happy to discuss this further next week, to justify my undeniably
correct decision.

CFJ: Stella?  Mar 25 10:56:42
Judge: Michael  Mar 25 16:18:52
Judgement:  Mar 28 00:00:37


Statement:

The Injunction issued by Judge Bowen in CFJ 128 is illegal.


Judgement: TRUE


Injunction: By 781, I am in turn required to issue an injunction calling
for a Formal Apology from Dave Bowen. I do not require any specific words
to be used. 


Argument: [Stella?]

Judge Bowen's Injunction orders that
"In accordance with Rule 798, I order that this decision be added
as an annotation to Rule 856, until either it or Rule 761 is changed or
until a future CFJ determines that the injuction no longer applies".

This is illegal on two accounts:
1) Rule 798 does not exist, only Rule 789 would apply
2) However, Rule 789 requires that
"The annotation shall remain only until one of the Rules
in the list of relevant Rules is amended, repealed, or transmuted"
Well, the list of relevant Rules as submitted by Chuck included
not only Rule 856 and 761, but 212 as well.
Hence, the Injunction is incomplete and hence illegal.

Reasons and Arguments: [Michael Norrish]

Rule 789 states that the Judge of an interpretation CFJ may make an
injunction requiring that the rule whose interpretation was under
question be annotated. However, the Judge must include the list of
`relevant rules' that were provided in the CFJ and this Dave Bowen
failed to do. 

By 781, I am in turn required to issue an injunction calling for a
Formal Apology from Dave Bowen. I do not require any specific words to
be used.

Uh... I dunno.  Okay, let's repeal that silly "Foreign Policy Directive"

True, Garth has the highest rank of succession, but
that does not absolve Jeffrey S. from posting a *public* message
that he is going to give up Speakership (as required by Rule 681)
and allowing a 3-day period for anyone to apply for Speakerhood.
As he has not done this, I maintain that Jeffrey S. is still Speaker,
and will CFJ on this if I must.

I just received the following (with a Cc: to Oerjan) from Matthew.
Rule 474 states that a player must announce his forfeiture
in order to forfeit, but it does not specify to whom this must
be announced, so I would argue that this is a valid forfeiture.
(It's in the subject line)

I can't resist anymore. It's quite interesting the way in which the
concerns of one game echo those of the other, and it just so happens
that at Tabula we are having something of a debate on this issue of
`rules' versus `other things'. I just proto-Proposed the following
rule:

> Title: creation of Offices

> Rule:

> The Voters of Tabula shall have the ability to make an Executive Order
> establishing Offices. An Office can only be established if a vote
> shows majority support from the collected Voters.

> When considering the creation of a possible Office, the Voters must be
> provided with a full specification of the following items:

> 1) The Office's name
> 2) The Office's salary
> 3) The initial holder of the Office
> 4) A `job description' specifying the duties of the Office. 

> These items must also be recorded in the log of the Executive Orders
> if it is passed.

> All Office-holders shall be governed by default rules for Officers.

> If a Creation of Office executive order is reversed, then the Office
> created is disestablished. 

> --------------------

> Now I admit, this does seem a bit strange. I'm still more used to
> the way things were done at Yoyo, but it does appear that this is a
> useful way of generalising the practice there. Note how the `rules'
> governing the office don't even make it into the Ruleset.

> In fact, they don't have any legal force at all. This is fine
> though; an Office holder is just fulfilling a contract (although not
> in the sense of Bill's latest proposal because we do not have anyone
> that could sign for the Voters as a group). If the Voters felt that
> an Office Holder was not doing their job, then the Voters could
> impeach/fire them. That of course would be another Order, as would
> be the Order that disestablished an Office.

Admittedly, this does assume the Executive Order mechanism that we
have at Tabula, but I think that the idea of having the job
specification elsewhere (not in the ruleset) should still be
implementable in Agora.

Michael.

   Well, we've just finished a game and all of the stocks have been returned
to the Bank.  Therefore, it is time to open auctions for the stock of all
players.  Bids must be posted to the public forum.  For these auctions bids
must be made in multiples of 0.01 Mark (minimal Mark granularity).  The auction
will close when the high bid for that stock has not changed in a period of
72 hours.  I declare the auctions open.

THE CURRENT RULESET
Part 1 of 5

Rules are listed as follows, where NNN represents the Rule number:

========================================

Rule NNN (Immutable or Mutable)
My Own Unofficial Title

NNN.  Semi-Official Rule Title, If There Is One

      Text of Rule

Annotation: Some Rules are annotated as required by Rule 789.
These annotations "shall guide the interpretation of that Rule."
Relevant Rules: Such annotations include a list of relevant Rules.

[Note: Some Rules are annotated by me to clarify their interpretation.
Unlike the official annotations, these are enclosed in brackets.
These annotations have no legal force in and of themselves.]

========================================



========================================

Rule 101 (Immutable)
Obey the Rules

101.

      All Players must always abide by all the Rules then in effect,
      in the form in which they are then in effect.  The Rules in the
      Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the first game.
      The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (Immutable) and
      201-219 (Mutable).

========================================

Rule 102 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Rules

102.

      Initially Rules in the 100's are Immutable and Rules in the
      200's are Mutable.  Rules subsequently Enacted or Transmuted
      (that is, changed from Immutable to Mutable or vice versa) may
      be Immutable or Mutable regardless of their Numbers, and Rules
      in the Initial Set may be Transmuted regardless of their Numbers.

========================================

Rule 103 (Immutable)
The Speaker and Voters

103.

      At any time, each Player shall be either a Voter or the Speaker;
      no Player may simultaneously be a Voter and a Speaker. At any
      time, there shall be exactly one Speaker. The term "Player" in
      the Rules shall specifically include both the Voters and the
      Speaker.

========================================

Rule 104 (Immutable)
First Speaker

104.

      The Speaker for the first game shall be Michael Norrish.

========================================

Rule 105 (Immutable)
What Is a Rule Change?

105.

      A Rule Change is any of the following:  (1) the enactment,
      repeal, or amendment of a mutable Rule; or (2) the transmutation
      of an immutable Rule into a mutable Rule or vice versa.
        (Note:  This definition implies that, at least initially, all
      new Rules are Mutable; Immutable Rules, as long as they are
      Immutable, may not be Amended or Repealed; Mutable Rules, as long
      as they are Mutable, may be Amended or Repealed; any Rule of any
      status may be Transmuted; no Rule is absolutely immune to change.)

========================================

Rule 106 (Immutable)
Adopting Proposed Rule Changes

106.

      All Rule Changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on.
      They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required
      number of votes and Quorum is achieved.

========================================

Rule 107 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Must Be Written Down

107.

      Any proposed Rule Change must be written down (or otherwise
      communicated in print media) before it is voted on. If adopted,
      it must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.

========================================

Rule 108 (Immutable)
When May Rule Changes Take Effect?

108.

      No Rule Change may take effect earlier than the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording
      explicitly states otherwise.  No rule change may have retroactive
      application.

========================================

Rule 109 (Immutable)
Rule Numbers

109.

      The Speaker shall give each proposed Rule Change a Number for
      reference.  The numbers shall begin with 301, and each Rule
      Change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next
      successive integer, whether or not the Proposal is adopted.
        If a Rule is Repealed and Reenacted, it receives the Number of
      the Proposal to Reenact it.  If a Rule is Amended or Transmuted,
      it receives the Number of the Proposal to Amend or Transmute it.
 
========================================

Rule 110 (Immutable)
Transmutation of Rules

110.

      Rule Changes that Transmute Immutable Rules into Mutable Rules
      may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among Votes
      legally cast.  Transmutation shall not be implied, but must be
      stated explicitly in a Proposal to take effect.
 
========================================

Rule 111 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Conflicts

111.

      In a conflict between a Mutable and an Immutable Rule, the
      immutable Rule takes precedence and the Mutable Rule shall be
      entirely void.  For the purposes of this Rule a Proposal to
      Transmute an Immutable Rule does not "conflict" with that
      Immutable Rule.
 
========================================

Rule 112 (Immutable)
Winning Must Be by Points

112.

      The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered
      from achieving n points to any other state of affairs.  The
      magnitude of n and the means of earning points may be changed,
      and Rules that establish a Winner when play cannot continue may
      be Enacted and (while they are mutable) be Amended or Repealed.

========================================

Rule 113 (Immutable)
Players May Always Forfeit

113.

      A Player always has the option to forfeit the Game rather than
      continue to play or incur a Game penalty.  No penalty worse than
      losing, in the judgment of the Player to incur it, may be
      imposed.

========================================

Rule 114 (Immutable)
At Least One Mutable Rule

114.

      There must always be at least one Mutable Rule.  The adoption of
      Rule Changes must never become completely inpermissible.

========================================

Rule 115 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Which Change Rule-Changing Rules Allowed

115.

      Rule Changes that affect Rules needed to allow or apply
      Rule Changes are as permissible as other Rule Changes.  Even
      Rule Changes that amend or repeal their own authority are
      permissible.  No Rule Change or type of move is impermissible
      solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a
      Rule.

========================================

Rule 116 (Immutable)
Permissibility of the Unprohibited

116.

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
      and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
      which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly or
      implicitly permits it.

========================================

Rule 201 (Mutable)
Quorum

201.

      Quorum for a proposed Rule Change is defined to be 20% of Voters
      at the beginning of the prescribed Voting Period for that
      Proposal.

========================================

Rule 206 (Mutable)
One Voter, One Vote

206.

      Each Voter has exactly one Vote.  The Speaker may not Vote.

========================================

Rule 208 (Mutable)
End of the Voting Period

208.

      At the end of the prescribed Voting Period on a Proposal, the
      Speaker shall reveal all Votes legally cast on that Proposal. If
      the Speaker's consent may be required for a Proposal to be
      adopted then the Speaker should indicate at that time whether or
      not e gives eir consent.  If the Speaker does not explicitly
      indicate that e refuses to consent to the Proposal, it shall be
      assumed that e consents.

========================================

Rule 212 (Mutable)
Resolving Rule Conflicts

212.

      If two or more Mutable Rules conflict with one another, or if
      two or more Immutable Rules conflict with one another, then the
      Rule with the lowest ordinal Number takes precedence.
        If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of rule) or takes
      precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.
        If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

========================================

Rule 217 (Mutable)
Judgements Must Accord with the Rules

217.

      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however, if
      the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the Statement
      to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider Game Custom and the
      Spirit of the Game before applying other standards.

========================================

Rule 312 (Mutable)
A Point for Voting

312.

      If a Voter votes, he gets one (1) point at the end of the Voting
      Period.

========================================

Rule 376 (Mutable)
When Does a Rule Change Take Effect?

376.  Time that a rule change takes effect:

      An adopted rule change takes full effect at the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it.
      The moment of the completion of the vote is defined by the date
      and time given in the line starting with "Date:" of the Nomic
      listserver message send by the Benevolent Speaker, announcing
      the result of the vote on the corresponding proposal.

========================================

Rule 388 (Mutable)
Game Status When a New Game Begins

388.  Starting a new Game:

      Whenever a new game of Nomic is begun, the status of the new
      Game when it begins shall be the same as the status of the old
      Game when it ended, in all respects where the Rules do not
      decide otherwise.

========================================

Rule 399 (Mutable)
The Office of the Rulekeepor

399.  The Office of the Rulekeepor:

      Let there be an Officer known as the Rulekeepor.
      The Rulekeepor shall maintain a complete list of the current
      Rules, and post this list to all Players at least once a week.
      
      So long as the Rulekeepor is in Office, the Speaker is not
      required to maintain or distribute the Rules.

========================================

Rule 402 (Mutable)
Transfer of Power of the Mighty Speaker

402.  Transfer of Power of the Mighty Speaker:

      When one Mighty Speaker is yielding his Office to another, the
      following procedure shall be followed:
      
       1) The Present Mighty Speaker shall forward copies of all
          necessary materials for the performance of his Office to the
          Prospective Mighty Speaker.
       2) The Prospective Mighty Speaker shall acknowledge the receipt
          of said materials.
       3) The Present Mighty Speaker shall post a message to the
          listserv announcing the official transfer of power, which
          occurs at the "Date:" of the Present Mighty Speaker's
          posting.

      The Present Mighty Speaker remains in Office until the successful
      completion of step 3.

========================================

Rule 404 (Mutable)
Legality of Proposals

404.  Legality of Proposals:

      As long as a Proposal satisfies all requirements in place at the
      time of its making for the proper making of Proposals, the act
      of making such a Proposal is legal regardless of its content.
      It is legal to propose a Rule which conflicts with other Rules
      or with itself, which is paradoxical, or which cannot be
      applied.

========================================

Rule 405 (Mutable)
No Vacations for Officers

405.  No Vacations for Officers:

      No Officer may be 'On Hold' while holding an Office.  If a
      current Officer should place himself On Hold, he is assumed to
      have resigned without appointing a successor, and the Office
      should be re-filled in the normal manner.  This Rule takes
      precedence over Rule 386.

========================================

Rule 406 (Mutable)
Clerk of the Courts

406.  Clerk of the Courts, Part I: Definition of Office:

      There shall exist an Office "Clerk of the Courts", who shall
      have general responsibility over administering Calls for
      Judgement, as outlined in the Rules.  The active Clerk of the
      Court may never be selected as a Judge.

      As a salary for carrying out his duties, he will receive 5
      points at the end of every seven days he is in Office, counting
      from his assumption of the Office.

      The initial holder of this Office shall be the Player who
      submitted this Proposal.

========================================

Rule 407 (Mutable)
Invoking Judgement

407.  Clerk of the Courts, Part II: Invoking Judgement:

      If Players disagree about the legality of a Move or the
      interpretation or application of a Rule, then a Player may
      invoke Judgement by submitting a Statement for Judgement to the
      Clerk of the Courts.  Disagreement, for the purposes of this
      Rule, may be created by the insistence of any Player.  When
      Judgement is invoked, the Clerk of the Courts must, as soon as
      possible, select a Judge as described in the Rules.  The Clerk
      of the Courts must then distribute the Statement to be judged,
      along with the identity of the Judge, to all Players.

========================================

Rule 408 (Mutable)
Accepting Judge-ship

408.  Clerk of the Courts, Part III: Accepting Judge-ship:

      After the Clerk of the Courts has distributed the Statement to
      be judged and the identity of the Judge, the Judge has one week
      in which to deliver a legal Judgement.  If the Judge fails to
      deliver a Judgement within this time, e is penalized 10 points
      and a new Judge is selected.  A Judgement is delivered by
      submitting that Judgement to the Clerk of the Courts, who must
      then distribute that Judgement to all Players as soon as
      possible.

========================================

Rule 413 (Mutable)
Winning by Paradox

413.  Winning By Paradox:

      If the Rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or
      if the legality of some action cannot be determined with
      finality, or if some action appears equally legal and illegal,
      then a player may Call For Judgement on a Statement to that
      effect.  If the Statement is judged TRUE, then the same Judge
      who judged the Statement TRUE must declare the most recent
      passed Proposal X such that the Statement was not TRUE before
      the passage of Proposal X, or declare that there is no such
      Proposal.  (Until the Judge does this, the Judgment is not
      valid.)  If the Judgement of TRUE is not overruled, then the
      Player who called for Judgement is declared the Winner of the
      game.
      
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared that
      there is no such Proposal X, the game is ended, with no
      provisions for restarting it.
      
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared such
      a Proposal X, the following actions are taken:
         - all Players remain active,
         - all Proposals curently being Voted upon are removed from
           consideration for Voting,
         - the scores for all Players are set to 0 (zero),
         - the Rules and explicit game custom are reverted to the
           state they were in before Proposal X was passed,
         - a Benevolent Speaker for the next Game is chosen:
              -If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the
               Benevolent Speaker, and the old Benevolent Speaker
               becomes a Voter,
              -If there is more than one Winner, the Benevolent
               Speaker randomly selects one of the Winners, who
               becomes the new Benevolent Speaker, and the old
               Benevolent Speaker becomes a Voter,
         - and a new Game is begun.

========================================

Rule 415 (Mutable)
How To Submit a Proposal

415.  "How a Proposal is Submitted":

      A Proposal by a Voter shall be made by submitting it to the
      Mighty Speaker. As soon as possible after receiving the
      Proposal, the Mighty Speaker shall assign the Proposal a Number
      and distribute the Proposal along with its number to all
      Players.
      
      The Mighty Speaker may also make Proposals. The Mighty Speaker
      must process all pending Voter-submitted Proposals first, and
      may then Process Proposals of the Mighty Speaker, assigning
      these Proposals a number and distributing them in the same
      fashion as any other Proposal.

========================================

Rule 417 (Mutable)
The Nomic Archivist

417.  Establishment of the Office of Archivist:

      That there be established an office known as the Nomic
      Archivist, which shall be governed by the default Rules
      concerning official posts. The initial duties of the Nomic
      Archivist shall be to record the passage and failure of
      Proposals, to maintain a "historical record" (defined below)
      of the Ruleset, to maintain a list of Judgements and their case
      histories, and to maintain a list of game Winners in past games.
      The Archivist is free to comment on the historical records as
      they see fit, but such commentary must be clearly delimited
      from the historical material. Where the material being stored
      does not already admit a classification method, the Archivist
      is free to design one themselves.

      The "historical record" of the Ruleset maintained by the
      Archivist is one that includes all rules ever part of the nomic
      Ruleset, annotated with information as to their ultimate fate,
      whether Repealed or Amended etc. This record of the Ruleset has
      no legal force.

      The duties required of the Archivist may be changed with their
      consent and at the request of the Office's controlling body
      (whatsoever that may be). Initially, the controlling body of
      this Office shall be all Players, and any request to change the
      duties must therefore be supported by a majority of Players
      "speaking" to the request.  Naturally, default Rules for
      Offices may establish a different controlling body for this
      Office.
      
      The salary of the Archivist office shall be determined by its
      controlling body. Initially, its salary shall be 5 points and
      one coin of the office-holder's group per week.
      
      The initial office-holder for this post shall be Michael
      Norrish.

========================================

Rule 434 (Mutable)
Game May Be Won By CFJ

434.  Judgement Required to Win (and Timing of Win):

      If a Player believes that he has won the Game, he may submit a
      CFJ to that effect.  If it is returned with the Judgement TRUE
      (and that Judgement is not Appealed), then he has won the Game
      as of the delivery of that Judgement.  If the Judgement is TRUE,
      but is Appealed, but is sustained (and no Proposal to reverse
      the verdict is made), then he has won the Game as of the
      delivery of the Appeal verdict.  If such a verdict is sustained,
      challenged by Proposal, but the Proposal does not pass, he has
      won the Game as of the completion of the Vote on that Proposal.

      Judgement on a CFJ to win the Game may *not* be delivered until
      at least 72 hours after its official announcement, in order to
      give time for the Judge to accept input from the community.

      This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which specifies
      the exact moment at which a Game is won.

[Note: Implicit Game Custom dictates that, despite the title,
this rule does not *require* a CFJ in order to win the game.]

========================================

Rule 450 (Mutable)
Game Entities May Not Be Arbitrarily Changed

450.  Game Entities may not be Arbitrarily Changed:

      Any Entity which is created by the Nomic Rules, and which exists only
      within the context of the current Game of Nomic, such as Points,
      Votes, etc. may *not* be changed by any action other than those
      specified by the Rules.

========================================

Rule 451 (Mutable)
Determination of Judgement--Timing

451.  Timing of CFJ Results:

      When a CFJ makes a Statement about the current state of the
      Game, the result of that CFJ shall be TRUE if and only if the
      Judge feels that that Statement was correct at the time that the
      CFJ was *issued*. Any changes that have happened in the time
      between the issuing of the CFJ and its delivery must be figured
      in to find the correct current state.

========================================

Rule 452 (Mutable)
Prohibition of Electioneering by the Mighty Speaker

452.  Prohibition of Electioneering by the Mighty Speaker:

      The Speaker may not use eis knowledge of the current status of a
      vote on a Proposal in an attempt to influence the result of the
      Vote on that Proposal. Violations of this Rule shall be
      considered a Class C Crime.

========================================

Rule 454 (Mutable)
Declaring Proposals

454.  Clarity of Proposals:

      All Proposals must declare what effect that Proposal will have
      on the Rule Set. If said Proposal has a Title, this Declaration
      shall appear on the line immediately below that Title. In any
      case, the Declaration shall appear in parentheses. The
      Declarations shall be as follows:

         (Creates a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes a new
            Rule to come into existance.
         (Amends a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes an
            existing Rule to change wording or form.
         (Repeals a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes an
            existing Rule to cease to exist.
         (Transmutes a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes a
            Mutable Rule to become Immutable, or vice versa.
         (Other) shall be used if no other Declaration has been
            defined which describes the Proposal.

      Additional legislation may define additional legal Declarations
      or change the presentation of the Declaration, but this Rule
      shall take precedence in all other cases.

========================================

Rule NNN (Immutable or Mutable)
My Own Unofficial Title

NNN.  Semi-Official Rule Title, If There Is One

      Text of Rule

Annotation: Some Rules are annotated as required by Rule 789.
These annotations "shall guide the interpretation of that Rule."
Relevant Rules: Such annotations include a list of relevant Rules.

[Note: Some Rules are annotated by me to clarify their interpretation.
Unlike the official annotations, these are enclosed in brackets.
These annotations have no legal force in and of themselves.]

========================================



========================================

Rule 101 (Immutable)
Obey the Rules

101.

      All Players must always abide by all the Rules then in effect,
      in the form in which they are then in effect.  The Rules in the
      Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the first game.
      The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (Immutable) and
      201-219 (Mutable).

========================================

Rule 102 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Rules

102.

      Initially Rules in the 100's are Immutable and Rules in the
      200's are Mutable.  Rules subsequently Enacted or Transmuted
      (that is, changed from Immutable to Mutable or vice versa) may
      be Immutable or Mutable regardless of their Numbers, and Rules
      in the Initial Set may be Transmuted regardless of their Numbers.

========================================

Rule 103 (Immutable)
The Speaker and Voters

103.

      At any time, each Player shall be either a Voter or the Speaker;
      no Player may simultaneously be a Voter and a Speaker. At any
      time, there shall be exactly one Speaker. The term "Player" in
      the Rules shall specifically include both the Voters and the
      Speaker.

========================================

Rule 104 (Immutable)
First Speaker

104.

      The Speaker for the first game shall be Michael Norrish.

========================================

Rule 105 (Immutable)
What Is a Rule Change?

105.

      A Rule Change is any of the following:  (1) the enactment,
      repeal, or amendment of a mutable Rule; or (2) the transmutation
      of an immutable Rule into a mutable Rule or vice versa.
        (Note:  This definition implies that, at least initially, all
      new Rules are Mutable; Immutable Rules, as long as they are
      Immutable, may not be Amended or Repealed; Mutable Rules, as long
      as they are Mutable, may be Amended or Repealed; any Rule of any
      status may be Transmuted; no Rule is absolutely immune to change.)

========================================

Rule 106 (Immutable)
Adopting Proposed Rule Changes

106.

      All Rule Changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on.
      They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required
      number of votes and Quorum is achieved.

========================================

Rule 107 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Must Be Written Down

107.

      Any proposed Rule Change must be written down (or otherwise
      communicated in print media) before it is voted on. If adopted,
      it must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.

========================================

Rule 108 (Immutable)
When May Rule Changes Take Effect?

108.

      No Rule Change may take effect earlier than the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording
      explicitly states otherwise.  No rule change may have retroactive
      application.

========================================

Rule 109 (Immutable)
Rule Numbers

109.

      The Speaker shall give each proposed Rule Change a Number for
      reference.  The numbers shall begin with 301, and each Rule
      Change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next
      successive integer, whether or not the Proposal is adopted.
        If a Rule is Repealed and Reenacted, it receives the Number of
      the Proposal to Reenact it.  If a Rule is Amended or Transmuted,
      it receives the Number of the Proposal to Amend or Transmute it.
 
========================================

Rule 110 (Immutable)
Transmutation of Rules

110.

      Rule Changes that Transmute Immutable Rules into Mutable Rules
      may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among Votes
      legally cast.  Transmutation shall not be implied, but must be
      stated explicitly in a Proposal to take effect.
 
========================================

Rule 111 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Conflicts

111.

      In a conflict between a Mutable and an Immutable Rule, the
      immutable Rule takes precedence and the Mutable Rule shall be
      entirely void.  For the purposes of this Rule a Proposal to
      Transmute an Immutable Rule does not "conflict" with that
      Immutable Rule.
 
========================================

Rule 112 (Immutable)
Winning Must Be by Points

112.

      The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered
      from achieving n points to any other state of affairs.  The
      magnitude of n and the means of earning points may be changed,
      and Rules that establish a Winner when play cannot continue may
      be Enacted and (while they are mutable) be Amended or Repealed.

========================================

Rule 113 (Immutable)
Players May Always Forfeit

113.

      A Player always has the option to forfeit the Game rather than
      continue to play or incur a Game penalty.  No penalty worse than
      losing, in the judgment of the Player to incur it, may be
      imposed.

========================================

Rule 114 (Immutable)
At Least One Mutable Rule

114.

      There must always be at least one Mutable Rule.  The adoption of
      Rule Changes must never become completely inpermissible.

========================================

Rule 115 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Which Change Rule-Changing Rules Allowed

115.

      Rule Changes that affect Rules needed to allow or apply
      Rule Changes are as permissible as other Rule Changes.  Even
      Rule Changes that amend or repeal their own authority are
      permissible.  No Rule Change or type of move is impermissible
      solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a
      Rule.

========================================

Rule 116 (Immutable)
Permissibility of the Unprohibited

116.

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
      and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
      which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly or
      implicitly permits it.

========================================

Rule 201 (Mutable)
Quorum

201.

      Quorum for a proposed Rule Change is defined to be 20% of Voters
      at the beginning of the prescribed Voting Period for that
      Proposal.

========================================

Rule 206 (Mutable)
One Voter, One Vote

206.

      Each Voter has exactly one Vote.  The Speaker may not Vote.

========================================

Rule 208 (Mutable)
End of the Voting Period

208.

      At the end of the prescribed Voting Period on a Proposal, the
      Speaker shall reveal all Votes legally cast on that Proposal. If
      the Speaker's consent may be required for a Proposal to be
      adopted then the Speaker should indicate at that time whether or
      not e gives eir consent.  If the Speaker does not explicitly
      indicate that e refuses to consent to the Proposal, it shall be
      assumed that e consents.

========================================

Rule 212 (Mutable)
Resolving Rule Conflicts

212.

      If two or more Mutable Rules conflict with one another, or if
      two or more Immutable Rules conflict with one another, then the
      Rule with the lowest ordinal Number takes precedence.
        If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of rule) or takes
      precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.
        If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

========================================

Rule 217 (Mutable)
Judgements Must Accord with the Rules

217.

      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however, if
      the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the Statement
      to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider Game Custom and the
      Spirit of the Game before applying other standards.

========================================

Rule 312 (Mutable)
A Point for Voting

312.

      If a Voter votes, he gets one (1) point at the end of the Voting
      Period.

========================================

Rule 376 (Mutable)
When Does a Rule Change Take Effect?

376.  Time that a rule change takes effect:

      An adopted rule change takes full effect at the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it.
      The moment of the completion of the vote is defined by the date
      and time given in the line starting with "Date:" of the Nomic
      listserver message send by the Benevolent Speaker, announcing
      the result of the vote on the corresponding proposal.

========================================

Rule 388 (Mutable)
Game Status When a New Game Begins

388.  Starting a new Game:

      Whenever a new game of Nomic is begun, the status of the new
      Game when it begins shall be the same as the status of the old
      Game when it ended, in all respects where the Rules do not
      decide otherwise.

========================================

Rule 399 (Mutable)
The Office of the Rulekeepor

399.  The Office of the Rulekeepor:

      Let there be an Officer known as the Rulekeepor.
      The Rulekeepor shall maintain a complete list of the current
      Rules, and post this list to all Players at least once a week.
      
      So long as the Rulekeepor is in Office, the Speaker is not
      required to maintain or distribute the Rules.

========================================

Rule 402 (Mutable)
Transfer of Power of the Mighty Speaker

402.  Transfer of Power of the Mighty Speaker:

      When one Mighty Speaker is yielding his Office to another, the
      following procedure shall be followed:
      
       1) The Present Mighty Speaker shall forward copies of all
          necessary materials for the performance of his Office to the
          Prospective Mighty Speaker.
       2) The Prospective Mighty Speaker shall acknowledge the receipt
          of said materials.
       3) The Present Mighty Speaker shall post a message to the
          listserv announcing the official transfer of power, which
          occurs at the "Date:" of the Present Mighty Speaker's
          posting.

      The Present Mighty Speaker remains in Office until the successful
      completion of step 3.

========================================

Rule 404 (Mutable)
Legality of Proposals

404.  Legality of Proposals:

      As long as a Proposal satisfies all requirements in place at the
      time of its making for the proper making of Proposals, the act
      of making such a Proposal is legal regardless of its content.
      It is legal to propose a Rule which conflicts with other Rules
      or with itself, which is paradoxical, or which cannot be
      applied.

========================================

Rule 405 (Mutable)
No Vacations for Officers

405.  No Vacations for Officers:

      No Officer may be 'On Hold' while holding an Office.  If a
      current Officer should place himself On Hold, he is assumed to
      have resigned without appointing a successor, and the Office
      should be re-filled in the normal manner.  This Rule takes
      precedence over Rule 386.

========================================

Rule 406 (Mutable)
Clerk of the Courts

406.  Clerk of the Courts, Part I: Definition of Office:

      There shall exist an Office "Clerk of the Courts", who shall
      have general responsibility over administering Calls for
      Judgement, as outlined in the Rules.  The active Clerk of the
      Court may never be selected as a Judge.

      As a salary for carrying out his duties, he will receive 5
      points at the end of every seven days he is in Office, counting
      from his assumption of the Office.

      The initial holder of this Office shall be the Player who
      submitted this Proposal.

========================================

Rule 407 (Mutable)
Invoking Judgement

407.  Clerk of the Courts, Part II: Invoking Judgement:

      If Players disagree about the legality of a Move or the
      interpretation or application of a Rule, then a Player may
      invoke Judgement by submitting a Statement for Judgement to the
      Clerk of the Courts.  Disagreement, for the purposes of this
      Rule, may be created by the insistence of any Player.  When
      Judgement is invoked, the Clerk of the Courts must, as soon as
      possible, select a Judge as described in the Rules.  The Clerk
      of the Courts must then distribute the Statement to be judged,
      along with the identity of the Judge, to all Players.

========================================

Rule 408 (Mutable)
Accepting Judge-ship

408.  Clerk of the Courts, Part III: Accepting Judge-ship:

      After the Clerk of the Courts has distributed the Statement to
      be judged and the identity of the Judge, the Judge has one week
      in which to deliver a legal Judgement.  If the Judge fails to
      deliver a Judgement within this time, e is penalized 10 points
      and a new Judge is selected.  A Judgement is delivered by
      submitting that Judgement to the Clerk of the Courts, who must
      then distribute that Judgement to all Players as soon as
      possible.

========================================

Rule 413 (Mutable)
Winning by Paradox

413.  Winning By Paradox:

      If the Rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or
      if the legality of some action cannot be determined with
      finality, or if some action appears equally legal and illegal,
      then a player may Call For Judgement on a Statement to that
      effect.  If the Statement is judged TRUE, then the same Judge
      who judged the Statement TRUE must declare the most recent
      passed Proposal X such that the Statement was not TRUE before
      the passage of Proposal X, or declare that there is no such
      Proposal.  (Until the Judge does this, the Judgment is not
      valid.)  If the Judgement of TRUE is not overruled, then the
      Player who called for Judgement is declared the Winner of the
      game.
      
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared that
      there is no such Proposal X, the game is ended, with no
      provisions for restarting it.
      
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared such
      a Proposal X, the following actions are taken:
         - all Players remain active,
         - all Proposals curently being Voted upon are removed from
           consideration for Voting,
         - the scores for all Players are set to 0 (zero),
         - the Rules and explicit game custom are reverted to the
           state they were in before Proposal X was passed,

Rule 417 (Mutable)
The Nomic Archivist

417.  Establishment of the Office of Archivist:

      That there be established an office known as the Nomic
      Archivist, which shall be governed by the default Rules
      concerning official posts. The initial duties of the Nomic
      Archivist shall be to record the passage and failure of
      Proposals, to maintain a "historical record" (defined below)
      of the Ruleset, to maintain a list of Judgements and their case
      histories, and to maintain a list of game Winners in past games.
      The Archivist is free to comment on the historical records as
      they see fit, but such commentary must be clearly delimited
      from the historical material. Where the material being stored
      does not already admit a classification method, the Archivist
      is free to design one themselves.

      The "historical record" of the Ruleset maintained by the
      Archivist is one that includes all rules ever part of the nomic
      Ruleset, annotated with information as to their ultimate fate,
      whether Repealed or Amended etc. This record of the Ruleset has
      no legal force.

      The duties required of the Archivist may be changed with their
      consent and at the request of the Office's controlling body
      (whatsoever that may be). Initially, the controlling body of
      this Office shall be all Players, and any request to change the
      duties must therefore be supported by a majority of Players
      "speaking" to the request.  Naturally, default Rules for
      Offices may establish a different controlling body for this
      Office.
      
      The salary of the Archivist office shall be determined by its
      controlling body. Initially, its salary shall be 5 points and
      one coin of the office-holder's group per week.
      
      The initial office-holder for this post shall be Michael
      Norrish.

========================================

Rule 434 (Mutable)
Game May Be Won By CFJ

434.  Judgement Required to Win (and Timing of Win):

      If a Player believes that he has won the Game, he may submit a
      CFJ to that effect.  If it is returned with the Judgement TRUE
      (and that Judgement is not Appealed), then he has won the Game
      as of the delivery of that Judgement.  If the Judgement is TRUE,
      but is Appealed, but is sustained (and no Proposal to reverse
      the verdict is made), then he has won the Game as of the
      delivery of the Appeal verdict.  If such a verdict is sustained,
      challenged by Proposal, but the Proposal does not pass, he has
      won the Game as of the completion of the Vote on that Proposal.

      Judgement on a CFJ to win the Game may *not* be delivered until
      at least 72 hours after its official announcement, in order to
      give time for the Judge to accept input from the community.

      This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which specifies
      the exact moment at which a Game is won.

[Note: Implicit Game Custom dictates that, despite the title,
this rule does not *require* a CFJ in order to win the game.]

========================================

Rule 450 (Mutable)
Game Entities May Not Be Arbitrarily Changed

450.  Game Entities may not be Arbitrarily Changed:

      Votes, etc. may *not* be changed by any action other than those
      specified by the Rules.

========================================

Rule 451 (Mutable)
Determination of Judgement--Timing

451.  Timing of CFJ Results:

      When a CFJ makes a Statement about the current state of the
      Game, the result of that CFJ shall be TRUE if and only if the
      Judge feels that that Statement was correct at the time that the
      CFJ was *issued*. Any changes that have happened in the time
      between the issuing of the CFJ and its delivery must be figured
      in to find the correct current state.

========================================

Rule 454 (Mutable)
Declaring Proposals

454.  Clarity of Proposals:

      All Proposals must declare what effect that Proposal will have
      on the Rule Set. If said Proposal has a Title, this Declaration
      shall appear on the line immediately below that Title. In any
      case, the Declaration shall appear in parentheses. The
      Declarations shall be as follows:

         (Creates a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes a new
            Rule to come into existance.
         (Amends a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes an
            existing Rule to change wording or form.
         (Repeals a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes an
            existing Rule to cease to exist.
         (Transmutes a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes a
            Mutable Rule to become Immutable, or vice versa.
         (Other) shall be used if no other Declaration has been
            defined which describes the Proposal.

      Additional legislation may define additional legal Declarations
      or change the presentation of the Declaration, but this Rule
      shall take precedence in all other cases.

      Judgement must be accompanied by reasons and arguments, which
      include, but are not necessarily limited to, citations of

      delivered without reasons and/or arguments is completely invalid.

      Such reasons and arguments form no part of the Judgement itself.
      However, the Clerk of the Courts must distribute the reasons and
      arguments along with the Judgement.

Allowed CFJ's

          - clearly allege that a specific Rule ought to be
            interpreted in a certain way.

Rule 663 (Mutable)
Injunctions--General

663.  General Rules For Injunctions

      There shall be an entity known as an Injunction, which may
      accompany certain Judgements of TRUE or FALSE as provided in the
      rules. An Injunction is a statement or series of statements
      specifying an action or actions which must take place. If a
      Judgement is is accompanied by an Injunction, that Injunction
      must be published with the Judgement. All players must abide by
      the Injunction beginning no later than 72 hours after its
      publication unless one of the following conditions then apply:
        - The Judgement which the Injunction accompanies is undergoing
          appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of the appeal
          process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but a proposal
          has been published which would overturn that decision if
          passed, and said proposal has not failed.
        - The validity of the Injunction itself is questioned by a
          pending CFJ.
        - A Judgement upholding the validity of the Injunction is
          undergoing appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of
          the appeal process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but
          a proposal has been published which would overturn that
          decision if passed, and said proposal has not failed.

      A Judgement may not be accompanied by an Injunction unless it is
      specifically permitted elsewhere in the rules. An Injunction
      must be completely consistent with all rules in effect at the
      time of issuance, and must be completely relevant to the matter
      addressed in the corresponding judgement.

      If any Player believes that an Injunction or any part of it does
      not meet the criteria for a valid Injunction, e may submit a CFJ
      to that effect. If the resulting Judgement supports the
      contention that the criteria are not met, the Injunction shall
      be considered illegal and shall have no legal force.

      This rule takes precedence over all rules governing Injunctions.

========================================

Rule 664 (Mutable)

      Judgement supports the allegation, the Judge may include with
      the Judgement an Injunction specifying that the move is to be
      retracted, and any resulting adjustments to the published game
      state. The adjustments to the game state must have been
      unambiguously specified within the CFJ, and these adjustments
      must only undo actions which were a direct or indirect result of
      that Move.

Rule 669 (Mutable)
To Disobey an Injunction is Criminal

669.  Contempt of Court

      asked if e wants the Office, and if not, a new one shall be
      selected in the same manner.

      require the Clerk of the Courts to fill a vacant Office of Clerk
      of the Courts.

Allowed CFJ's

      A "Move" refers to any specific action taken by a Player or
      group of Players in the context of the game. Any invocation of
      Judgement must satisfy one or more of the following conditions:

          - clearly allege that a specific Move is illegal;
          - clearly allege that a specific Rule is illegal or lacking
            in legal force, in whole or in part;
          - clearly allege that a specific Rule ought to be
            interpreted in a certain way.
          - clearly allege that the current published game state is
            incorrect, and in what respects.

      A CFJ which does not satisfy at least one of the above
      conditions shall be deemed invalid and shall not be accepted for
      Judgement by the Clerk of the Courts. However, this Rule shall
      defer to rules which explictly permit CFJs that do not
      necessarily meet the above conditions.

========================================

Rule 663 (Mutable)
Injunctions--General

663.  General Rules For Injunctions

      There shall be an entity known as an Injunction, which may
      accompany certain Judgements of TRUE or FALSE as provided in the
      rules. An Injunction is a statement or series of statements
      specifying an action or actions which must take place. If a
      Judgement is is accompanied by an Injunction, that Injunction
      must be published with the Judgement. All players must abide by
      the Injunction beginning no later than 72 hours after its
      publication unless one of the following conditions then apply:
        - The Judgement which the Injunction accompanies is undergoing
          appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of the appeal
          process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but a proposal
          has been published which would overturn that decision if
          passed, and said proposal has not failed.
        - The validity of the Injunction itself is questioned by a
          pending CFJ.
        - A Judgement upholding the validity of the Injunction is
          undergoing appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of
          the appeal process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but
          a proposal has been published which would overturn that
          decision if passed, and said proposal has not failed.

      A Judgement may not be accompanied by an Injunction unless it is
      specifically permitted elsewhere in the rules. An Injunction
      must be completely consistent with all rules in effect at the
      time of issuance, and must be completely relevant to the matter
      addressed in the corresponding judgement.

      If any Player believes that an Injunction or any part of it does
      not meet the criteria for a valid Injunction, e may submit a CFJ
      to that effect. If the resulting Judgement supports the
      contention that the criteria are not met, the Injunction shall
      be considered illegal and shall have no legal force.

      This rule takes precedence over all rules governing Injunctions.

========================================

Rule 664 (Mutable)
Illegal Injuctions are Crimes

664.  Judicial Accountability

      If a Judge hands down an Injunction which is determined illegal
      by a CFJ, then a Criminal Court may find em GUILTY of a Class C

Injuction--Retracting an Illegal Move

665.  Specific Injunctions, part I

      Judgement supports the allegation, the Judge may include with
      the Judgement an Injunction specifying that the move is to be
      retracted, and any resulting adjustments to the published game
      state. The adjustments to the game state must have been
      unambiguously specified within the CFJ, and these adjustments
      must only undo actions which were a direct or indirect result of
      that Move.

========================================

Rule 669 (Mutable)
To Disobey an Injunction is Criminal

669.  Contempt of Court

      If the rules require a Player to obey an Injunction and e fails
      to do so, then a Criminal Court may find that Player GUILTY of a
      Class C crime.

      recent Clerk of the Courts. A tentative replacement shall be
      asked if e wants the Office, and if not, a new one shall be
      selected in the same manner.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which may seem to
      require the Clerk of the Courts to fill a vacant Office of Clerk
      of the Courts.

      the Vizier shall be the Player whose Application for that Group
      was received first by the Registrar, if e is still a Member of
      that Group.

      3.  the Ordinancekeepor of the Group, so long as the
      Ordinancekeepor is a Member of that Group.  If the Ordinances do
      not so specify, then the Vizier of that Group shall also be its
      Ordinancekeepor.

      4.  How the Points or Currencies in the Group's Treasury shall
      be spent, so long as it does not conflict with the Rules.  A
      Group may spend Points or Currencies in the same manner as a
      Player.  When Points or Currencies are to be spent from the
      Group's Treasury, the Vizier of that Group shall inform the
      Scorekeepor or Recordkeepor for the Currency, as is appropriate.

Rule 724 (Mutable)
Winning the Game

724.  Requirements for Winning

      The Winner is the first Voter to achieve sufficiently many
      Points.  The minimum number of Points required for Player X to
      win is 10*N*(1+G/6), where N is the number of Players currently
      registered in the Game, and G is the number of Games which
      Player X has already won.  If more than one Voter achieves this
      condition simultaneously, then all such Voters win.  When a Game
      ends in this manner:
        - If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the new
          Speaker and the old Speaker becomes a Voter.
        - If there is more than one Winner, the Voter with the highest Point 
          total becomes the new Speaker.  If more than one Voter is
          tied for the highest score, the old Speaker randomly selects
          one of them to become the new Speaker.  The old Speaker
          becomes a voter.
        - All Player's scores are reset to 0.
        - A new Game is begun.  All Rules and Proposals retain the
          status they had at the end of the old Game.

Rule 725 (Mutable)
Stocks

725.  Timing of Stock point transfer.

      Let there be for each Player one Currency called X Stock,
      where X is the name of the Player.

      On Friday Noon GMT 5% of the Points of Player X (with a minimum
      of two Points) shall be transfered to the Player (or Players)
      who holds Stock X.

      At the passing of this Proposal the Bank has possession of all
      Stocks.  During the following week the Banker shall collect the
      bids in Marks.  Those bids have to be made by the Players
      (either alone or acting together on the same Stock) in a message
      to the server.  No bid shall be made, which can not be covered
      by the Marks in  he bidders Bank account (to be verified by the
      Banker.)

      After one week each of the Stocks shall be transfered from the
      Bank to the highest bidder. If two or more bids for Stock X are
      exactly equal, the Stock shall go to player X (if one of the
      highest bidders), or to the Player with the lowest score.

      If a given Stock X is bought by Player X, the Marks of the bid
      shall be transfered from Player X to the Bank.
      If a given Stock X is bought by another Player (or Players) then
      Player X, the Marks of the bid shall go from this Player(s) to
      Player X.

      The Banker shall keep track of the Stocks held by each Player.

      average of the scores of all active Players scores, not
      including those scores, which happen to be negative.
      Points may not be gained, lost, or traded except as explicitly

Rule 728 (Mutable)
Destruction of and Compensation for Stocks of Leaving Players

728.  Stocks of leaving Players I

      When Player X leaves the game, Stock X shall be destroyed.
      If Stock X was held at that time by another Player, this Player
      shall be compensated with half the price in Marks that this
      Player paid for the Stock X.
      These Marks shall come from the account of Player X, *before*
      those shall be destroyed, as required by other Rules.
      If there are not enough Marks available, the deficit shall be
      paid by the Bank.
      This Rule applies to the Stock of Players that have left the

      The proceedings shall go to Player X, unless they obtain their
      own Stock, in which case the proceedings shall go to the Bank.

Rule 733 (Mutable)
Default Rules for Officers

733.  Default Rules for Officers

      An Official is any Player who has been Appointed or Elected to
      an Office specified in the Rules. A Judge is not an Officer.
      An Officer may be replaced by another Player, by a Proposal
      stating so, and that Proposal passes.
      An Officer may resign at any time, provided e appoints a
      successor.
      If an Officer resigns while a Proposal is being voted upon to
      replace eim, the Player proposed will by eis Successor.
      This Rule applies to general Offices, and therefore defers to
      Rules for specific Offices.

Rule 736 (Mutable)
The Marxist

736.  The Marxist

      Let there be the Patent Title known as "Marxist", which is
      awarded to the Player with the most Marks, or if tied, to the
      Players with the most Marks. Only the current richest Player
      or Players may hold this title.

      The determination and announcement of assignment and revoking
      of the Title is made by the Banker, who must use the most
      accurate means of determining this available to eim, and must
      make the announcement as soon as possible after becoming aware
      of a change in holder of the Title.

      However: To respect some Players' wish for privacy, and in
      view of the secret nature of Marks accounts, a prospective
      Marxist must first be asked if e wants the Title. If not, then
      instead of announcing, "Player x is granted the Patent Title of
      'Marxist', e announces, "Patent Title of 'Marxist' is granted
       to an anonymous Player".

Rule 747 (Mutable)
Definition of a Conserved Quantity

      An Entity is only a Conserved Quantity if a Rule explicitly
      states such. A Conserved Quantity may only be Created or
      Destroyed as explicitly stated by the Rules. If a Conserved
      Quantity is given to an Entity, and no Rule states where that
      Conserved Quantity is to be taken from, then the transfer shall
      not take place. If a Conserved Quantity is taken from an Entity,
      and no Rule states where that Conserved Quantity is to be
      transfered to, then the Conserved Quantity shall be transfered
      to the Bank.

      be selected by the designated Sweepstakes Officer, and the Voter
      who owns that Entry shall receive 1 Point per Entry by any other
      Player into the Lottery. For purposes of this Rule, a week
      shall begin on Monday at 12:00 am and shall last seven days,

      be awarded automatically, without need for a Proposal.

      If a Player Wins a Game despite a handicap factor X, then that
      Player shall instead receive the Patent Title "Champion*X",

      Auctioneer, who shall be the Banker, the Banker's chosen willing
      delegate, or any other player as specified in other rules.
 
      Once the identity of the Auctioneer is determined, the Auction
      begins with the Auctioneer making an announcement to the game
      forum stating what  Nomic entity is up for Auction, and that e
      is accepting bids.
 
      Players who wish to participate in the Auction then must
      indicate their interest by sending a bid to the Auctioneer.
 
      The list of players who have indicated an interest is not

      Announcements the Auctioneer must share it on demand.

Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal

761.  Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal: Adjusting for Abstentions

      When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the Votes which
      have been legally cast shall be counted by the Speaker. If a
      Proposal is not Contested, and there are more FOR votes cast
      then AGAINST votes, then that Proposal shall take effect.  If
      such a Proposal has an equal number of FOR and AGAINST Votes,
      then the Speaker shall decide whether the Proposal shall be
      Adopted, or if that Proposal shall fail. If the Proposal is
      Contested, and the number of FOR votes cast is at least twice
      the number of AGAINST votes cast, then that Proposal shall take
      effect.

      If a Rule will change the actions required of or forbidden to
      the Speaker, and the Speaker opposed the Proposal, then that
      Proposal shall be considered Contested. The Speaker shall

      Treasury as specified in the Y Ordinances.  If the Y Ordinances
      are silent on this issue, or if Group Y has ceased to exist,
      then 1/N times the contents of the Y Treasury, rounded
      downwards, shall be transferred to Player X, where N is the
      number of Members of Group Y immediately before Player X ceased
      to be a Member of Group Y.  This transfer is not taxable, and
      may incude a negative number of Points.  This Rule takes

Rule 764 (Mutable)
Mischief

764.  Mischief

      Any Player or Group X may perform an Act of Mischief directed

      are defined in other Rules; such definitions must include a 
      positive Price in Coins, or the form of Mischief is not
      permissible.  This Rule explicitly takes precedence over all
      other Rules which purport to determine which forms of Mischief
      are permissible.

      To cause an Act of Mischief,  X  sends to the Public Forum a
      message containing:
      - the Name of the object, Y;
      - the effect of the Act of Mischief;
      - the Number of the Rule which permits the form of Mischief;
      - indication of which Coins in X's account will be used as
      payment for the Act of Mischief.  Coins of Group Y, or the
      Group to which Player Y belongs, may not be used as payment.  

      The effect of the Act of Mischief is applied immediately upon 
      publication of the above message in the Forum.  An additional
      effect of this Act of Mischief is that
      - for each Coin of Group Z spent as payment above, two Points
      are removed from the Z Treasury;
      - the Coins used as payment above are removed from X's account
      and destroyed.

Rule 766 (Mutable)
Groups

766.  Amend Rule 714.

      A Group is initially formed by a set of Players which has
      registered with the Registrar to form a Group; other Players may
      join later.  Each Group has a Name, a Membership, a Vizier,
      an Ordinancekeepor, a Treasury, an Initial Set of Ordinances,
      and an associated form of Currency, called the <name> Coins,
      where <name> is the Name of the Group.

      1.  The Name may not be the Name of another Group.

      2.  The Membership is a set of Players;  these Players are
      Members of the Group, and all other Players are not.

      3.  Synchronously with the registration of a Group, two Offices
      are created known as the <name> Vizier, and the <name>
      Ordinancekeepor, where <name> is the Name of the Group.
      These Offices may never be empty, and the <name> Vizier and
      <name> Ordinancekeepor must both be a member of <name> Group.
      The <name> Vizier shall inform the Registrar whenever the
      Membership or the Ordinancekeepor of the <name> group changes.
      When the <name> Vizier changes, the new Vizier shall inform the
      Registrar of the change.
      The <name> Ordinancekeepor shall keep an accurate and current
      record of the Ordinances of the <name> Group.

      4.  The Treasury is a repository for Points and Currencies and
      has the same capabilities for holding, trading, and spending
      Points and Currencies as does a Player.

      5.  The Ordinances are a description of the operation of the
      Group.

      6.  The <name> Coins are a form of Currency which is created
      synchronously with the registration of the Group.  The <name>
      Group may create <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be
      placed in the <name> Treasury.  The <name> Group may destroy
      <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be removed from the
      <name> Treasury.

      Ordinances of a Group may determine how and when the Group
      casts its Votes; if the Ordinances are silent on this issue
      then the Group may not cast its Votes.  The Votes of the
      Group are cast when the Vizier sends a message to the Speaker
      to that effect during the Voting Period and this action is
      legitimate insofar as the Ordinances are concerned.

      When a Player submits a Proposal, e may pay one Mark to the Bank
      (if e has at least one Mark) and impose Sanity on that Proposal.
      E must inform both the Banker and the Speaker when doing so.
      A Proposal which has Sanity imposed upon it is known as a Sane
      Proposal.  The Speaker shall, when e distributes a Sane
      Proposal, inform the Players that it is a Sane Proposal.

      No non-Voter Nomic entity may Vote on a Sane Proposal.  Each
      Voter shall have exactly one Vote on a Sane Proposal, and
      each Voter's Vote shall be counted exactly once on a Sane
      Proposal.

      This rule takes precedence over any rule allowing a non-Voter
      Nomic entity to Vote; over any rule which gives any Voter
      more or less than one Vote on a proposal; and over any
      rule which would cause any Voter's Vote to be counted more or
      less than once.

      Judge must issue an Injunction that the Ninny submit a Formal
      Apology.  This Injunction may also include a list of up to ten
      Prescribed Words.  By a Formal Apology is meant a letter of at
      least 200 words, containing all of the Prescribed Words,
      explaining the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
      for self-improvement, and posted in the Public Forum.  Within 48
      hours of the posting of this Formal Apology, the Squealer must
      either submit a Proposal that the Ninny's Apology be accepted,
      or submit a Proposal that the Ninny's Aplology be rejected,
      but not both.  No other Player may submit such a Proposal, and
      the Squealer may submit only one.  If a Proposal to accept the
      Apology fails, or if a Proposal to reject the Apology passes,

Abandonment of Speakerhood

785.  Improve Speaker Succession I

      If the Speaker has abandoned eir post, another new, Temporary
      Speaker is selected according to the "Rules of Succession", or
      if no such rules are defined, the other Player not on hold with
      the highest Score becomes the temporary Speaker.  This does not
      force the Game to be over in this case, and Scores are not reset
      to 0. The Game continues until a Player Wins, at which time a
      new Game is begun and the Winner becomes the real Speaker. The
      Temporary Speaker shall make reasonable effort to obtain the
      former Speaker's materials: proposal queue, voting records, etc.
      but if this is not possible, then the Temporary Speaker shall
      request that these be resubmitted by the Players. If a Speaker
      is replaced in this manner, e has eir score set to minus 2N
      Points immediately, where N is the number of Points required for
      a Player to Win the Game.

      Abandonment is determined as follows: If any Player suspects
      that the Speaker has Abandoned, e sends a message to all Players
      calling on the Speaker to announce eir presence.  The Speaker
      must reply to all Players within one week; if e does not, e is

      within three days of the Abandonment or resignation of the
      Speaker.  The old Speaker may not send such a message.  This

      Rules relevant to that CFJ, which must include the Rule in
      question.  If the statement is Judged TRUE, the Judge may
      include with the Judgement an Injuction requiring the Rulekeepor
      to annotate the Rule in question with the Statement in the CFJ
      and the list of relevant Rules.

      The annotation shall remain only until one of the Rules
      in the list of relevant Rules is amended, repealed, or
      transmuted; or until a CFJ determines that the injunction no
      longer applies, as described below.  While it remains, it shall
      guide the application of that Rule.

      If a Player believes that the circumstances which led to the
      Judgement no longer prevail and the annotation is therefore no
      longer applicable, e may submit a CFJ to that effect. If it is
      Judged TRUE, the annotation shall be stricken from the rule set.

Rule 790 (Mutable)
Filling Vacant Offices

790.  Filling Vacant Offices

      If, for any reason, an Office is vacant, that fact shall be
      announced by the Electioneer.  The Electioneer shall be the
      Registrar; or in eir absence, the Speaker.  All Players willing
      to hold the Office shall notify the Electioneer of that fact
      within three days of eir announcement of the vacancy.  At the
      end of the three day period, the Electioneer shall randomly
      choose one player from those who indicated a willingness to hold
      the Office, and that Player shall become that Officer.  This
      rule applies to Offices in general, and thus defers to Rules for
      specific Offices.

Rule 791 (Mutable)
Limit on Total Proposals Up for Vote

791.  Limits On Proposals Up For Vote

      There may be no more than PL Proposals up for Vote at any given
      time.  "PL" is the Proposal Limit, which is defined to be 15.

      The Speaker shall enforce this by delaying the distribution of
      Proposals in excess of this number. This Rule takes precedence,
      when permitted, over other Rules which require sooner
      distribution.

      If Proposal "Schemes" exist, then for the purpose of the
      Proposal limit, a Scheme shall count as a single Proposal.
      (*Was: 560*)

========================================

Rule 792 (Mutable)
What Happens When Proposal Limit is Reached

792.  Managing the Proposal Queue

      The Speaker shall notify all Players whenever the number of

      least PL/2 additional submitted Proposals. However, e may not do
      this until at least 24 hours after the Proposal queue was last
      closed. As soon as this notification appears on the Public
      Forum, Players are prohibited from submitting any more
      Proposals, and the Speaker shall refuse to accept any which are
      inadvertently submitted.

      When the number of Proposals up for Vote has dropped to PL/2 or
      below, the Speaker shall announce that Proposals are once again
      being accepted. After this appears on the Public Forum, Players
      may again submit Proposals.

========================================

Rule 793 (Mutable)
Selecting a Judge

793.  Appointment of Judges 

      Upon receipt of a Call For Judgement (CFJ), the Clerk of the
      Courts (CotC) shall randomly appoint a Voter to be Judge
      excluding those on hold, calling for judgement, whose move is
      under judgement in said CFJ, or have declined appointment on
      this CFJ.

      Voters may decline to serve on a particular case by notifying
      the CotC within 72 hours of appointment.  The declining Player
      shall not be eligible to serve as Judge for this CFJ and shall
      also lose two points, one of which shall be given to the CotC.

      Upon receiving notice of a Voter declining to serve the CotC
      shall randomly appoint a new Judge from eligible Voters.

      words of another Player, or other references, that Player shall
      not be penalized in points for the terminology or grammar used
      in those quotes.  This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule
      which specifies terminology or grammar.
      (*Was: 362*)

========================================

Rule 796 (Mutable)
The Distributor

796.  Make Use of the Distributor Optional

      There shall be an Office known as the Distributor. Whenever the
      Rules state that anything must be sent to all Players, they
      may instead be sent to the Distributor with some indication
      that they should be forwarded to all Players. The Distributor
      shall then send this message to all Players as soon as possible
      and in the order recieved. The first  Distributor shall be Wes.
      This Rule shall take precedence over all Rules which require a
      Player to send something to all Players.
      (*Was: 510*)

========================================

Rule 799 (Mutable)
Additional Declarations

799.  Amend Declarations

      There shall be additional legal Declarations which are as
      follows:

         (Award a Patent Title) shall be used if the Proposal does not
            Enact a Rule, but awards an existing Patent Title to a
            person.
         (Appeal by Proposal) shall be used for Proposals which seek
            to overturn a Judgement.
         (Run for Office) shall be used if a Proposal seeks to place a
            Player in Office, according to the Rules for Offices.

Rule 803 (Mutable)
Quantum Marks--0.01

803.  Marks Granularity

      All Marks transfers between Game Entities must be in multiples
      of 0.01 Marks. Furthermore, whenever a quantity of Marks is
      changed, that quantity is immediately adjusted by rounding to
      the nearest .01 Mark.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which would permit a
      different granularity of Marks.

========================================

Rule 804 (Mutable)
Mandatory Stock Liquidation at End of Game

804.  Liquidation of Stock at End of Game

      At the end of a Game, all Stocks will be returned to the Bank to
      be Auctioned upon the start of a new Game.

      Each Player that owned Stock (as of the end of the old Game)
      will be compensated to the amount of one half of the Marks paid
      by that Player for eis Stocks.  The Marks for a given Stock
      shall be drawn from the account of the Player to which the Stock
      corresponds.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules governing ownership
      of Stocks.

========================================

Rule 805 (Mutable)
Definition of "As Soon As Possible"

805.  Defined Partial Ordering of Actions

      Whenever a Player is required to perform a certain action "as
      soon as possible", e is required to perform this action before
      performing any other actions which have a less strictly defined
      time requirement.  However, email correspondence of a purely
      discussionary nature is excluded from the ordering requirement,
      and may be conducted at any time.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which stipulate a
      less stringent ordering requirement for the performance of these
      actions.

========================================

Rule 806 (Mutable)
Speaker Performs Duties of Vacant Offices

806.  Provide For Vacant Offices

      While an Office is vacant, and until it is filled as provided in
      other rules, the Speaker shall fulfill the duties of that
      Office.  The Speaker may delegate those duties to a willing
      Player if e desires.

      This Rule applies to Offices in general, and defers to the Rules
      for specific Offices.

========================================

Rule 807 (Mutable)
Non-Rule-Change Proposals

807.  Non-Rule-Change Proposals

      Proposals may be made which do not contain Rule Changes.  The
      permissible forms of Non-Rule-Change Proposals (or NRC
      Proposals), and the Declarations needed to propose them, shall
      be defined in other legislation.

      NRC Proposals are Voted upon and treated exactly like other
      Proposals, and shall be Numbered exactly like other Proposals.
      Upon the Adoption of a NRC Proposal, it shall take effect with
      results as described in the Rule or Rules that define the form
      of the Proposal in question.

      participating on behalf of the Players of this Nomic
      Game in any Central Nomic Game to be created.

      The Ambassador shall report to the Public Forum once a
      Nomic Week on any new Foreign Policy developements of
      that Nomic Week or the previous one.  In any Nomic Week
      in which Foreign Policy activity occurs, the Ambassador
      shall receive a salary of two (2) Points.

      Upon any change in the position of Speaker, the Office
      of Ambassador shall devolve to the new Speaker.  Except
      for this provision, the Office is chosen as described
      in other Rules.

      Proposals may be submitted directing the Ambassador on
      how to conduct a single piece of Foreign Policy business.
      Such Proposals are automatically Sane, and if passed are
      binding upon the Ambassador.  If the Ambassador acts
      contrary to such a Proposal, e may be charged with a 
      Class C Crime.  Such Proposals are submitted with the
      the following legal Declaration:
         (Foreign Policy Directive)

      Instances where a Player breaks this rule are to be ignored by
      said Office or Officer until e receives the message thru means

Rule 822 (Mutable)
No Coercive Proposals

822.  Stop the Insanity

      Proposals whose obvious and direct intent is to coerce a Player
      into voting against eir conscience are disallowed. For the
      purpose of Rule 106 or its successors, such a proposal is
      considered not to be "proposed in the proper way".

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which would
      otherwise allow such a shameful Proposal to be voted on.

========================================

823.  Marks Conversions

      At the end of each game let each Player that did not win have

      Proposal submitted in excess of this number; responsibility for
      enforcement is given to the Speaker.

========================================

      A Player may only be found Guilty once for a particular instance
      of a particular Crime. If a Player admits to being Guilty while
      a Criminal Court is in session to find that Player Guilty, e
      shall suffer the penalties as if e had been found Guilty by a
      Criminal Court. If a Player admits to being Guilty before
      Criminal Court has been called, then a Criminal Court shall not
      be called for that instance of that Crime, and the Player shall
      suffer any penalties for committing the Crime.  This Rule takes
      precedence over other Rules that define when a Criminal Court
      should be called.
      (*Was: 605*)

========================================

Rule 848 (Mutable)
Determining When a Rule Has Been Broken

848.  Determining when a Rule has been broken:

      If a Player believes that any Player has not abided by a Rule
      then in effect, in the form in which it was then in effect, then
      the Player may invoke Judgement on a Statement to that effect.
      Similarly, if a Player believes that any Player has commited a
      Crime, e may invoke Judgement on a Statement to that effect.
      Either kind of Statement is known as an Accusation.  A Criminal
      Court is defined as the Judge of an Accusation.
      However,
        -The Accusing player immediately loses 5 points.
        -No Player may be so Accused of actions committed before the
         adoption of this Rule or more than 30 days before the
         Accusation.
        -No Player may be so Accused more than once concerning the
         same committed act, unless the last such Accusation has been
         judged UNDECIDED.
        -The following exception takes precedence over previous Rules 
         concerning Judgement: Neither Accusing nor Accused Player may
         act as Judge for the Accusation; in any case where this would
         occur, a random Voter, neither Accuser nor Accused, shall be
         Judge.
      If the Statement is judged TRUE, the Accused Player has been
      found Guilty of breaking the Rule or committing the Crime, as
      applicable.  If the Statement is judged FALSE, the Accused
      Player has been found Not Guilty of breaking the Rule or
      committing the Crime, as applicable.

852.  Mandatory actions are not crimes

      It is never a Crime for any Player to perform an action which is

Rule 853 (Mutable)
Oaths

853.  Code of honor

      In order to make an Oath, a Player must send a message
      to at least one other Player, stating the fact that they
      are making an Oath, and what the Oath is.

      If someone makes an Oath, e must do that which e has sworn
      to do, as long as it is legal for em to do so.

      E who defies this has broken this Rule, and shall also be guilty
      of a Class C Crime.

      No rule may force someone to make an Oath;
      this rule takes precedence over all rules that attempt to do so.

========================================

Rule 855 (Mutable)

855.  Marks are Conserved

      Marks are a Conserved Quantity.  The total number of Marks
      is Public Information.

Votes Required to Create/Destroy a Conserved Quantity

856.  Conserved Quantities Really ARE Conserved, Part I

      Any Proposal which introduces a new way to Create or Destroy
      a Conserved Quantity shall require at least three times as
      many FOR Votes as AGAINST Votes in order to pass.  This
      restriction does not apply to Proposals which define new
      Conserved Quantities or Create the initial stock of a new

      or Nomiclike Games taking place on the Internet.
      The find of any such Game will be rewarded by a
      bonus of five Points.

      If another Player than the Ambassador locates such
      a Game first, five Points will be transfered from the
      Ambassador to this Player.

========================================

Rule 862 (Mutable)
The Entrepeneur

862.  The Patent Title of Entrepreneur

      Let there exist the Patent Title of Entrepreneur.

I will be resigning as Scorekeepor shortly.

Recent CFJs and Player consensus, coupled with job responsibilities and other
personal pursuits, as well as an interest in other areas of Agora Nomic, have
made it too difficult to perform the duties that are expected of me.

Part of the immediate cause for this draction (i.e., drastic action) is a
realization that Stella's CFJ 129, which I have been selected to judge, must be
judged TRUE, and the changes to the Game State will be very tedious to fix. I
don't have the time to do this; neither do I want to stand in contempt of a
fairly clear CFJ.

When I submit the Scorekeepor reform package which I have protoproposed
earlier, and if it passes, the Scorekeepor job will lighten somewhat and I
would consider taking it back at that time. But at this time, I don't have the
time even to get the reform package submitted.

Interested, capable, and ambitious Players who would like to take over this
important Office should contact me as soon as possible. If interested, I can
make the LANACS accounting program available to you; I found it rather useful.

Perhaps it's time to enact the "Point Sucker" proposals?

Agora Nomic Scorekeepor

Proto Proposal Ian-4-A
Foreign Policy Directives Defined
(Amends a Rule)

The last paragraph of Rule 861 shall be amended to read as follows:

   Non-Rule-Change Proposals may be submitted directing the Ambassador on
how to conduct a single piece of Foreign Policy business.  These proposals
are automatically Sane and must be submitted with the following legal
Declaration:
   (Foreign Policy Directive)

   A proposal of this type, herein called an FPD, is not to be kept with
the Ruleset. Instead, the Ambassador is responsible for keeping a list of
FPDs and making them available to anyone who asks for them.  FPDs may be
repealed by a Non-Rule-Change proposal with the following Declaration:
   (Repeals an FPD)

   The Ambassador is required to conduct Foreign Policy as e sees fit, as
long as e does not act contrary to any FPDs.  If the ambassador acts
contrary to an FPD, e may be charged with a Class C Crime.

===

Notes:
   o Why make FPDs Sane?
   o Can we say that FPDs are to be kept outside of the ruleset? #807 says
that NRC proposals are voted upon and treated exactly like other proposals,
so my guess is not.
   o I would like for FPD's to be enacted and repealed easier than other
rules, but I'm open to arguments against this. In any case, #807 forbids
this, though a simple precedence statement would take care of that.

Here is a Proto-Proposal I just thought of.

                 Garth

====================

Hard References Forbidden
(Creates a Rule)

No Rule may refer to another Rule by Number.  Any Proposal that would
add such a reference to the Ruleset shall be considered to have been
improperly submitted.  Any existing Rules making such a reference are
hereby declared null and void until amended to remove such references.

This Rule takes precedence over any Rules that make such a reference.

[ Hard references are a real headache, as the Rule referred to may
eventually be Amended or Transmuted or even Repealed!  Besides, it's
easy enough to just refer to Rules by what they do. ]

Here is a new version of my old Emergency Marks Tax.

                    Garth

=======================

Emergency Marks Tax
(Creates a Rule)

If at any point in time the Bank owns zero or less Marks, the Banker
shall transfer two percent of each Player's Marks account to the Bank.

[ There are currently 218.22 Marks out there, according to the Banker.
(Does anyone else feel that this is a bit too much?)  So the Emergency
Tax will yield roughly 4 Marks.  This is an easy and relatively painless
way to keep the economy flowing and the Bank out of arrears. ]

                Garth

========================
Other Rule Changes
(Creates a Rule)

New kinds of Rule Changes may be defined by the Rules, so long as
they either create, change, or repeal one or more Rules, or make
one or more changes to the Game State.

A Proposal is defined as a proposed Rule Change.

This Rule takes precedence over other Rules describing the nature
of Rule Changes.

[ When Transmuted, this will patch the hole in 105. ]

========================

Other Rule Changes
(Transmutes a Rule)

The previous Proposal, if Adopted, is hereby Transmuted
into an Immutable Rule.

Default Rules for Adopting Proposals
(Amends a Rule)

Rule 761 is Amended in its entirety to read:

When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the Votes which
have been legally cast shall be counted by the Speaker. If a
Proposal is not Contested, and the ratio of FOR Votes to AGAINST
Votes exceeds the mandated Adoption Ratio for that Proposal, then
that Proposal shall be Adopted.  If the ratio for such a Proposal
exactly equals the required Adoption Ratio, then the Speaker shall
decide whether the Proposal shall be Adopted, or if that Proposal
shall fail.

The Adoption Ratio for all Proposals shall be 1:1, unless otherwise
specified in the Rules.  Unanimity is defined as an Adoption Ratio
of infinity:1.

If a Rule will change the actions required of or forbidden to the
Speaker, and the Speaker opposed the Proposal, then that Proposal
shall be considered Contested. The Speaker shall declare if e
opposes the Proposal when e distributes the Proposal.  A Contested
Proposal shall have its Adoption Ratio doubled.

CFJ 131

The Judge is Oerjan.

CFJ: Dave Bowen  Mar 30 10:11:55
Judge: Oerjan


Statement:

Rule 862 conflicts with Immutable Rule 105 and is thereby entirely void in
accordance with Rule 111.


Argument: [Dave Bowen]

   Rule 862, in attempting to restrict the nature of amendments that may be
made to it, conflicts with Rule 105 which allows any amendment of a mutable
rule.  Since this conflict is that of a Mutable Rule with an Immutable Rule,
Rule 111 applies and the Mutable Rule, i.e. Rule 862, shall be entirely void.

Rule 105 (Immutable)
What Is a Rule Change?

105.

      A Rule Change is any of the following:  (1) the enactment,
      repeal, or amendment of a mutable Rule; or (2) the transmutation
      of an immutable Rule into a mutable Rule or vice versa.
        (Note:  This definition implies that, at least initially, all
      new Rules are Mutable; Immutable Rules, as long as they are
      Immutable, may not be Amended or Repealed; Mutable Rules, as long
      as they are Mutable, may be Amended or Repealed; any Rule of any
      status may be Transmuted; no Rule is absolutely immune to change.)

Rule 111 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Conflicts

111.

      In a conflict between a Mutable and an Immutable Rule, the
      immutable Rule takes precedence and the Mutable Rule shall be
      entirely void.  For the purposes of this Rule a Proposal to
      Transmute an Immutable Rule does not "conflict" with that
      Immutable Rule.

Rule 862 (Mutable)
The Entrepeneur

862.  The Patent Title of Entrepreneur

      Let there exist the Patent Title of Entrepreneur.
      This Title will be awarded to the most enterprizing
      Free Enterprizer.
      The Entrepreneur will be chosen by means of an election
      organized by the Banker, by any means he sees fit.
      Candidates for the Title are Chuck, KoJen, Oerjan and Waggie.

      This Rule can only be amended by a Proposal to award the
      Patent Title of Entrepreneur to another Player.

: would be to simply create a new class called 'Things that get voted

Well, in that case, do you see anything that needs doing at all, other
than maybe touching up 807 a little?  (Particularly for Numbering.)

In this scheme, 'things that get voted on' are called Proposals.

Changes to the Ruleset are called 'Proposed Rule Changes', and things
that aren't are called 'Non-Rule-Change Proposals' or 'Directives' if
you prefer.

If we go via this route, I would still want to put in something like
my current patch, so that if the Voters want to implement Proposal
Schemes, they can.

What would people think of Transmuting 807 (with mods, of course) in
order to make 105 shut up about NRC Proposals?  It's not clear that
807 has legal effect currently.  CFJ, anyone?

: Then we get a nice, well-defined, `object-oriented' hierarchy. Let's
: not contaminate our names and concepts by making the term `Proposal'
: stand for more than it need to. 

See above.  Proposal does indeed do that duty.

About time!  This idea was a voted doen part of the suite which included
the current rule title legislation.

Also voted down were several different proposals to make all hard
references mutable througout the ruleset when the rule referred to changes;
another was to make it illegal to change a rule to which a hard refernce is
made.

The thing about the current precednece laws is, if something overrules an
older rule, when the older rule gets amended the something now overrules it
be simply having a lower number --- we could say that hard references may
be left out of the ruleset after the rules to which they refer are changed.

Do we have any cases of a rule DEFERING to a specific rule?  The above
mechanism wouldn't apply then; but that isn't something that happens; the
deference claims are all general.

I protopropose that the ruleskeeper may omit precedence clauses referring
to obsolete rules.

Here is the latest version of my Proto-Proposal to patch 105.

How do you guys like this one?  Will you Vote FOR it?

                Garth

P.S.  BTW, Chuck, the "otherwise change" is in there in case
some clever Player thinks of something.  For example, my
Proto-Proposal to Renumber Rules.  It's clearly a Rule Change,
yet not really one of the existing categories.  And the "one
or more" is there to permit things like your Proposal Schemes.

And Michael, my new definition of Proposal should satisfy you.

========================

Other Rule Changes and Proposals
(Creates a Rule)

New kinds of Rule Changes may be defined by the Rules, so long as
they either Create, Amend, Repeal, Transmute, or otherwise change
one or more Rules.

All proposed Rule Changes are Proposals.  Other kinds of Proposal
may be defined by the Rules.  They shall be treated as proposed
Rule Changes for the purposes of Numbering by the Speaker.

This Rule takes precedence over other Rules describing the nature
of Rule Changes and proposed Rule Changes.

[ When Transmuted, this will patch the hole in 105. ]

========================

Other Rule Changes and Proposals
(Transmutes a Rule)

The previous Proposal, if Adopted, is hereby Transmuted
into an Immutable Rule.

========================

Remove an Unneeded Rule
(Repeals a Rule)

Rule 807 is hereby Repealed, provided the previous two Proposals were
Adopted.

Here is the latest version of my Proto-Proposal to patch 105.

Two important changes added that I had forgotten.  I removed
the deadly word "either" from the first sentence, and added
a clause forbidding NRC Proposals from being put in the
Ruleset.

How do you guys like this one?  Will you Vote FOR it?

                Garth

The "directly" was in the initial set, but got left out at some
amendment.  It belongs in there.  Almost every proposal, after all,
*indirectly* affects the actions required of/forbidden to the Speaker.

CFJ 127

The Judge is Alice.

Scorekeepor: Duane loses 10 points.

Duane is ineligible to judge any further CFJ's until he sends the
Clerk a message stating that he again wishes to be eligible.

CFJ: Chuck  Mar 23 23:05:16
Judge: Duane  Mar 24 00:14:39
Defaulted:  Mar 31 00:14:39
Judge: Alice


Statement:

In delivering judgement on CFJ 125, David Nicol violated Rule
663.


Argument:

The Injunction which David Nicol attempted to serve in his judgement
is in violation of Rule 663, which specifies that any Injunctions
must be as described in other Rules.  There is no Rule describing
an Injunction of the sort which David Nicol attempted to deliver.

While the Injunction described in Rule 665 might seem to match
the Injunction which David Nicol delivered, there are *three*
problems, any one of which alone would invalidate the Injunction.
1) the CFJ does not allege that I violated any Rule, only that
I "should" have included Rule 861 in the Ruleset.  2) the adjustments
to the Game State were not "unambiguously specified" within the CFJ.
3) the CFJ applies to proposal 861 only, and not to all FPD's;
however, the attempted Injunction applies to all FPD's.

Note that if this CFJ is found TRUE, the Judge must issue an Injunction
of the sort described in Rule 781.

Evidence:

Rule 663 (Mutable)
Injunctions--General

663.  General Rules For Injunctions

      There shall be an entity known as an Injunction, which may
      accompany certain Judgements of TRUE or FALSE as provided in the
      rules. An Injunction is a statement or series of statements
      specifying an action or actions which must take place. If a
      Judgement is is accompanied by an Injunction, that Injunction
      must be published with the Judgement. All players must abide by
      the Injunction beginning no later than 72 hours after its
      publication unless one of the following conditions then apply:
        - The Judgement which the Injunction accompanies is undergoing
          appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of the appeal
          process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but a proposal
          has been published which would overturn that decision if
          passed, and said proposal has not failed.
        - The validity of the Injunction itself is questioned by a
          pending CFJ.
        - A Judgement upholding the validity of the Injunction is
          undergoing appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of
          the appeal process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but
          a proposal has been published which would overturn that
          decision if passed, and said proposal has not failed.

      A Judgement may not be accompanied by an Injunction unless it is
      specifically permitted elsewhere in the rules. An Injunction
      must be completely consistent with all rules in effect at the
      time of issuance, and must be completely relevant to the matter
      addressed in the corresponding judgement.

      If any Player believes that an Injunction or any part of it does
      not meet the criteria for a valid Injunction, e may submit a CFJ
      to that effect. If the resulting Judgement supports the
      contention that the criteria are not met, the Injunction shall
      be considered illegal and shall have no legal force.

      This rule takes precedence over all rules governing Injunctions.

Rule 665 (Mutable)
Injuction--Retracting an Illegal Move

665.  Specific Injunctions, part I

      If a CFJ alleges that a specific Move is illegal, and the
      Judgement supports the allegation, the Judge may include with
      the Judgement an Injunction specifying that the move is to be
      retracted, and any resulting adjustments to the published game
      state. The adjustments to the game state must have been
      unambiguously specified within the CFJ, and these adjustments
      must only undo actions which were a direct or indirect result of
      that Move.

CFJ 125

Scorekeepor: David Nicol receives 5 points for rapid judgement.

CFJ: Stella?  Mar 23 02:05:21
Judge: David Nicol  Mar 23 10:52:03
Judgement:  Mar. 23 17:05:05



Statement:

"Proposal 861, while being a Foreign Policy Directive, was not a
Non-Rule-Change Proposal in the sense of Rule 807.
Hence after its adoption it should have been included by the Rulekeepor
in the Rule Set."


Judgement: TRUE


Injunction:  I injunct that the Rulekeepor should include Foreign Policy
Directives in the Rule Set.


Argument: [Stella?]

Nowhere in the Rules it says that a Foreign Policy Directive
is not to be treated as an ordinary proposed rule change.
Apart from that, not including a Proposed Rule Change in the Rule Set, sets
the dangerous precedent that such a Rule can not be amended, or repealed
if so desired by the Players. A fact which would make it even more
immutable than the Immutables!

Here's my Appeals Proto-Proposal again, slightly modified for
clarity.  I've also added an Amendment to 799 removing the
Declaration (Appeal by Proposal).

                 Garth

==========================

The Justices and the Justiciar
(Creates a Rule)

Let there be three Players known as the Justices.  One Justice shall
be the Speaker, one shall be the Clerk of the Courts, and one shall
be the holder of a new Office called the Justiciar.  The Office of
Justiciar shall abide by the default Rules for Offices, save that
there is no weekly Salary for the Office.

The Justices shall have the responsibility of Judging Statements that
have been Appealed.  They shall receive the same compensation as
Judges for each Statement so Judged.

The Speaker and Clerk may delegate their duties as Justices to other
willing Players if they desire.  Further, any Justice must so delegate
eir duties as necessary to prevent em from holding more than one
position of Justice, or in any case a Justice would otherwise have to
decide if e is Guilty of breaking a Rule or committing a Crime.

==========================

Appealing Judgement
(Amends a Rule)

Rule 690 is Amended in its entirety to read:

A Judgement may be Appealed upon the insistence of any three Players to
the Public Forum.  Any Statement that is Judged UNDECIDED is
automatically Appealed.

If a Judgement is successfully Appealed, the Justices shall each Judge
the Statement as if they were Judges.  They may confer with each other
on the case before delivering Judgement if they desire.  If a Justice
should fail to return Judgement in the allotted time, e shall be fined
three Points for each day by which e missed the deadline.  This fine
shall be levied by the Scorekeepor.

If an Appealed Statement receives more TRUE Judgements than FALSE
Judgements from the Justices, it shall be considered to have been ruled
TRUE.  Similarly, if it receives more FALSE Judgements than TRUE
Judgements from the Justices, it shall be considered to have been ruled
FALSE.  Otherwise, it shall be considered to have been ruled UNDECIDED.

The decision of the Justices is final; no further Appeal of that
Statement may be made.

If the decision of the original Judge of the Statement is reversed
(that is, changed from TRUE to FALSE, or from FALSE to TRUE) by the
Justices, the Judge shall return the compensation e received to the
Point Reserve.

======================

Get Rid of Appeal By Proposal
(Amends a Rule)

The sentence of Rule 799 that begins with the phrase (Appeal by Proposal)
is hereby removed.

What about this one: on Monday just after the Marks Interest calculation
the sum of all Marks in circulation gets normalized back to 100.

That is, if a Player posseses x Marks and there are a total of 105 Marks
in circulation, after normalisation he possesses  x*100/105.

This should work to keep Marks constant, as nor the Bank, nor any Player
is allowed to have a negative number of Marks.

In reality the normalization is only needed when the Number of Marks
in circulation actually changes, that is at Game end.

Stella?

Philosophical Camps
(Creates a Rule)

A Philosophical Camp is a group of Players which is treated like a
Group, with the following exceptions:

A Camp does not have a Treasury, and can own no Points or Currencies.

For each Camp, there shall be an Officer known as the <name> Philosopher,
(where <name> is the name of the Camp) who shall fulfil the functions
of Vizier and Ordinancekeepor for the Camp.  The first Philosopher of
a Camp shall be the first Player to join that Camp.

Each Camp shall have exactly two Votes on each Proposal.

The initial set of Ordinances shall be created by each Camp by a 
majority vote of its Members.  Camps may not be created freely, but
only via the Rules.  Camps are not created through the Registrar. 

Any number of Players may belong to a Camp.  A Player may belong to
both a Group and a Camp, but not to more than one Camp.

There are three Camps:  The Platonic Camp, the Pragmatic Camp, and
the Ambivalent Camp.

Here's a touched up version of my Camp Proto-Proposal.

                      Garth

====================

Philosophical Camps
(Creates a Rule)

A Philosophical Camp is a group of Players which is treated like a
Group, with the following exceptions:

A Camp does not have a Treasury, and can own no Points or Currencies.

For each Camp, there shall be an Officer known as the <name>
Philosopher, (where <name> is the name of the Camp) who shall fulfill
the functions of Vizier and Ordinancekeepor for the Camp.  The first
Philosopher of a Camp shall be the first Player to join that Camp.

Each Camp shall have exactly two Votes on each Proposal.  The Camp
Philosopher shall notify the Speaker if and when the Camp casts its
Votes.

The initial set of Ordinances shall be created by each Camp by a 
majority vote of its Members, after all Players have joined a Camp.
Camps may not be created freely, but only via the Rules.  Camps are
not created through the Registrar. 

Any number of Players may belong to a Camp.  A Player may belong to
both a Group and a Camp, but not to more than one Camp.  All current
Players must join a Camp within one week of the passage of this Rule,
and all new Players must join a Camp within one week of joining.
However, Players may leave a Camp provided they simultaneously join
another.

There are three Camps:  The Platonic Camp, the Pragmatic Camp, and
the Ambivalent Camp.

Here's my Appeals Proto-Proposals again.  I think they are much 
better now.
                 Garth

==========================

The Justices
(Creates a Rule)

Let there be three Players known as the Justices.

The Justices shall be randomly chosen by the Clerk of the Courts from
the list of Players each time a CFJ is Appealed, unless Camps exist.
If Camps exist, the three Camp Philosophers shall be the Justices.

If a Camp Philosopher is ineligible to be Justice on a case, the Clerk
of the Courts shall randomly select another Member of that Camp to be
Justice for that case.  If there is no other Member of that Camp, the
Clerk of the Courts shall randomly select a Player to be Justice for
that case.

The Justices shall have the responsibility of Judging Statements that
have been Appealed.  They shall receive the same compensation as
Judges for each Statement so Judged.

A Player is ineligible to serve as Justice on a particular case if e
made the original CFJ, if e was the Judge of the original CFJ, if e is
being Accused of breaking a Rule or committing a Crime, or if e has
already been selected as a Justice for that case.

==========================

Appealing Judgement
(Amends a Rule)

Rule 690 is Amended in its entirety to read:

A Judgement may be Appealed upon the insistence of any three Players to
the Public Forum.

If a Judgement is successfully Appealed, the Justices shall each Judge
the Statement as if they were Judges.  They may confer with each other
on the case before delivering Judgement if they desire.  If a Justice
should fail to return Judgement in the allotted time, e shall be fined
three Points for each day by which e missed the deadline.  This fine
shall be levied by the Scorekeepor.

If any two of the Justice's Judgements agree, the Statement shall be
considered to have been Judged accordingly.  Otherwise, it shall be
considered to have been ruled UNDECIDED.  The Justices' reasoning
and arguments shall be recorded with the original CFJ.

The decision of the Justices is final; no further Appeal of that
Statement may be made.

If the decision of the original Judge of the Statement is changed by
the Justices, the Judge shall return the compensation e received to the
Point Reserve.

======================

Get Rid of Appeal By Proposal
(Amends a Rule)

The sentence of Rule 799 that begins with the phrase (Appeal by Proposal)
is hereby removed.

Here are some Proto-Proposals to permit the Speaker and COTC to be
selected as Judge.  I honestly don't see why this isn't permitted.

Would you guys Vote FOR these?

                     Garth

=======================

The Clerk of the Courts, Part I, Take 2
(Amends a Rule)

The last sentence of the first paragraph of Rule 406 is hereby
removed.

[ This will permit the CotC to be selected as Judge.  I don't see
why we can't trust em, when we trust the Speaker to count Votes on
eir own Proposals. ]

========================

Selecting a Judge
(Amends a Rule)

Rule 793 is Amended in the following ways:

All instances of the word Voter are changed to the word Player.

All instances of the word Voters are changed to the word Players.

CFJ 127

Scorekeepor: Alice receives 5 points for speedy Judgement.

CFJ: Chuck  Mar 23 23:05:16
Judge: Duane  Mar 24 00:14:39
Defaulted:  Mar 31 00:14:39
Judge: Alice  Mar 31 02:31:42
Judgement:  Mar 31 14:58:36


Statement:

In delivering judgement on CFJ 125, David Nicol violated Rule
663.


Judgement: FALSE


Argument: [Chuck]

The Injunction which David Nicol attempted to serve in his judgement
is in violation of Rule 663, which specifies that any Injunctions
must be as described in other Rules.  There is no Rule describing
an Injunction of the sort which David Nicol attempted to deliver.

While the Injunction described in Rule 665 might seem to match
the Injunction which David Nicol delivered, there are *three*
problems, any one of which alone would invalidate the Injunction.
1) the CFJ does not allege that I violated any Rule, only that
I "should" have included Rule 861 in the Ruleset.  2) the adjustments
to the Game State were not "unambiguously specified" within the CFJ.
3) the CFJ applies to proposal 861 only, and not to all FPD's;
however, the attempted Injunction applies to all FPD's.

Note that if this CFJ is found TRUE, the Judge must issue an Injunction
of the sort described in Rule 781.

Evidence:

Rule 663 (Mutable)
Injunctions--General

663.  General Rules For Injunctions

      There shall be an entity known as an Injunction, which may
      accompany certain Judgements of TRUE or FALSE as provided in the
      rules. An Injunction is a statement or series of statements
      specifying an action or actions which must take place. If a
      Judgement is is accompanied by an Injunction, that Injunction
      must be published with the Judgement. All players must abide by
      the Injunction beginning no later than 72 hours after its
      publication unless one of the following conditions then apply:
        - The Judgement which the Injunction accompanies is undergoing
          appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of the appeal
          process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but a proposal
          has been published which would overturn that decision if
          passed, and said proposal has not failed.
        - The validity of the Injunction itself is questioned by a
          pending CFJ.
        - A Judgement upholding the validity of the Injunction is
          undergoing appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of
          the appeal process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but
          a proposal has been published which would overturn that
          decision if passed, and said proposal has not failed.

      A Judgement may not be accompanied by an Injunction unless it is
      specifically permitted elsewhere in the rules. An Injunction
      must be completely consistent with all rules in effect at the
      time of issuance, and must be completely relevant to the matter
      addressed in the corresponding judgement.

      If any Player believes that an Injunction or any part of it does
      not meet the criteria for a valid Injunction, e may submit a CFJ
      to that effect. If the resulting Judgement supports the
      contention that the criteria are not met, the Injunction shall
      be considered illegal and shall have no legal force.

      This rule takes precedence over all rules governing Injunctions.

Rule 665 (Mutable)
Injuction--Retracting an Illegal Move

665.  Specific Injunctions, part I

      If a CFJ alleges that a specific Move is illegal, and the
      Judgement supports the allegation, the Judge may include with
      the Judgement an Injunction specifying that the move is to be
      retracted, and any resulting adjustments to the published game
      state. The adjustments to the game state must have been
      unambiguously specified within the CFJ, and these adjustments
      must only undo actions which were a direct or indirect result of
      that Move.

CFJ 125

Scorekeepor: David Nicol receives 5 points for rapid judgement.

CFJ: Stella?  Mar 23 02:05:21
Judge: David Nicol  Mar 23 10:52:03
Judgement:  Mar. 23 17:05:05



Statement:

"Proposal 861, while being a Foreign Policy Directive, was not a
Non-Rule-Change Proposal in the sense of Rule 807.
Hence after its adoption it should have been included by the Rulekeepor
in the Rule Set."


Judgement: TRUE


Injunction:  I injunct that the Rulekeepor should include Foreign Policy
Directives in the Rule Set.


Argument: [Stella?]

Nowhere in the Rules it says that a Foreign Policy Directive
is not to be treated as an ordinary proposed rule change.
Apart from that, not including a Proposed Rule Change in the Rule Set, sets
the dangerous precedent that such a Rule can not be amended, or repealed
if so desired by the Players. A fact which would make it even more
immutable than the Immutables!

Reasons and Arguments: [Alice]

There were three arguments presented to invalidate the Injunction, all of 
which are clearly false.  These are:
1) the CFJ does not allege that I (meaning Chuck) violated any Rule, only that
I (meaning Chuck) "should" have included Rule 861 in the Ruleset.  2) the 
adjustments to the Game State were not "unambiguously specified" within the 
CFJ.  3) the CFJ applies to proposal 861 only, and not to all FPD's;
however, the attempted Injunction applies to all FPD's.

Firstly, CFJ 125 does not, indeed, clearly allege that Chuck violated
a Rule, as required by Rule 662.  However, this statement is completely
irrelevant to the issue at hand, as we are discussing the validity of
the Injunction issued with CFJ 125 and not the original CFJ itself.  
CFJ 125 may have been technically invalid, but CFJ 127 does not concern
itself with this particular topic.  Therefore, that argument is hereby 
disregarded.  
Secondly, Rule 665 states that "The adjustments to the game state must have
been unambiguously specified within the CFJ...".  These adjustments, were
included in the original CFJ, as required by the preceding Rule.
Player Stella? wrote concerning Proposal 861: "Hence after its adoption it 
should have been included by the Rulekeepor in the Rule Set."  It would be 
difficult to more clearly state what changes should take place.  Proposal 861
should be included in the Ruleset.  Another more interesting and noteworthy 
point, however, is that this argument is also irrelevant, seeing that it,
again, is questioning the original CFJ itself, and not the Injunction.
(Recall that Rule 665 specifies that the CFJ must contain this information,
not the Injunction.)
Lastly, the attempted Injunction does, in fact, apply only to Proposal 861.
Rule 663 states that "An Injunction must be completely consistent with all
rules in effect at the time of issuance, and must be completely relevant 
to the matter addressed in the corresponding judgement."  The Injunction
that accompanied CFJ 125 applies to, and only to, Proposal 861, seeing that
there were no other Foreign Policy Directives in or out of the Ruleset.
While the statement that CFJ 125 applies only to Proposal 861, and that
the Injunction in question applies to all FPDs is true, Proposal 861 IS
_all_ of the FPDs.  Thusly the two terms are synonymous for the time being.
Therefore, the Injunction is specific to the original CFJ.

b) As this statement is Judged TRUE, Rule 451 applies to it.
c) As Rule 451 takes precedence over Rule 463 (according to Rule 212)
any score changes that have happened in the time between the issuing
of CFJ 122 (March 6) and its delivery (March 24) must be taken into
account.
d) Therefore the score changes which resulted from several Players having
voted on Proposal 826 (notably Chuck, Dave B, David N., Garth, KoJen,
Stella? and Oerjan) should be taken into account in the score.


Judgement: TRUE


Argument: [Stella?]

Reasons and Arguements: [KoJen]

Rule 451 takes precedence over Rule 463. Thus, even though the
Scores were approved by the Auditor and it has been over a Week without anyone
contending the Scores (Rule 463), the Scores must be adjusted according to the
decision of CFJ 122 (Rule 451).

CFJ 132

The Judge is Dave Nicol.

CFJ: Garth  Mar 31 10:56:37
Judge: Dave Nicol


Statement:  

            Rule 823 should be interpreted to mean that Marks converted
            from Points at the end of a Game are drawn from the Bank, not
            Created.


Arguments: [Garth]

            The text of 823 clearly states this.  It's a wonder noone 
            noticed it before.

Evidence:

823.  Marks Conversions

      At the end of each game let each Player that did not win have
      eir points be converted to Marks in a ratio of 50 points to 1
      Mark.  The winner's points shall be taken away and e shall not
      receive any Mark's compensation for eis points.

      Marks for these conversions shall be awarded from the bank as
      directed by the Ruleset
      (*Was: 732*)

I think you make it sound too simple. Although we are supposed to
judge according to the Rules, those Rules are by now so complex that
most CFJ's might be argued one way or another.
(See my Ruling on CFJ 126.)

We had Appeal by Justices before and it didn't work...

As a CFJ should settle a dispute, I still think it should be judged
by a majority of players, at least in Appeal. IMO there is no difference
between a Rule to guide play, or a CFJ. The latter also guides play, as it
gives an interpretation of a Rule.

====

On request:

PROTO-PROPOSAL
Stabilizing marks (I)

Every time Marks are created or destroyed the Banker shall normalize
the total sum of Marks T held by Nomic Entities and Players.

Normalization is defined as follows. Let N be the number of Marks
that is required after normalization.
The number of Marks held by a Player of Nomic Entity will be
multiplied by N/T or by 0.75 if N/T is larger than 0.75.

N will be defined by other legislation.

PROTO-PROPOSAL
Stabilizing marks (II)

The total number of Marks N held Players and Nomic Entities, after
normalization shall be 4*(number of Players)+10.

[Note that the normalization has to be gradual to avoid a flight into
Points.]

Here is the latest version of my Proto-Proposal to patch 105.
I think it's finally ready.

How do you guys like this one?  Will you Vote FOR it?

Please comment.

I have been contemplating one more change:  adding ", and do not
directly change the Game State." to the first sentence.  This
would prevent people from sneaking in a "Rule Change" (which
does change Rules) but which ALSO does other things.

                Garth

========================

Other Rule Changes and Proposals
(Creates a Rule)

New kinds of Rule Changes may be defined by the Rules, so long as
they Create, Amend, Repeal, Transmute, or otherwise change one or
more Rules.

All proposed Rule Changes are Proposals.  Other kinds of Proposal
may be defined by the Rules.  They shall be treated as proposed
Rule Changes for the purposes of Numbering by the Speaker, but
they shall not under any circumstances be incorporated into the
Ruleset.

This Rule takes precedence over other Rules describing the nature
of Rule Changes and/or proposed Rule Changes.

[ When Transmuted, this will patch the hole in 105. ]

========================

Other Rule Changes and Proposals
(Transmutes a Rule)

The previous Proposal, if Adopted, is hereby Transmuted
into an Immutable Rule.

========================

Remove an Unnecessary Rule
(Repeals a Rule)

Rule 807 is hereby Repealed, provided the previous two Proposals were
Adopted.

[ The previous two Proposals completely obviate the need for 807. ]

Final draft.  I can't possibly see what else could be added.  I
am not willing to incorporate more changes unless there is a
glaring necessity.

Does anyone object to these Proto-Proposals?

Other Rule Changes and Proposals
(Creates a Rule)

New kinds of Rule Changes may be defined by the Rules, so long as
they Create, Amend, Repeal, Transmute, or otherwise change one or
more Rules, without making any other direct changes to the Game
State.

All proposed Rule Changes are Proposals.  Other kinds of Proposal
may be defined by the Rules.  They shall be treated as proposed
Rule Changes for the purposes of Numbering by the Speaker, but
they shall not under any circumstances be incorporated into the
Ruleset.  Such Proposals will not be valid unless the Rules 
define which Player or Players must record them, or explicitly
state that they need not be recorded.

This Rule takes precedence over other Rules describing the nature
of Rule Changes and/or proposed Rule Changes.

(Transmutes a Rule)

The previous Proposal, if Adopted, is hereby Transmuted
into an Immutable Rule.

========================

Remove an Unnecessary Rule
(Repeals a Rule)

Rule 807 is hereby Repealed, provided the previous two Proposals were
Adopted.

[ The previous two Proposals completely obviate the need for 807. ]

Latest draft.  Not many changes, except to the third one.

Does anyone object to these Proto-Proposals?

                Garth

========================

Other Rule Changes and Proposals
(Creates a Rule)

New kinds of Rule Changes may be defined by the Rules, so long as
they Create, Amend, Repeal, Transmute, or otherwise change one or
more Rules, without making any other direct changes to the Game
State.

All proposed Rule Changes are Proposals.  Other kinds of Proposal
may be defined by the Rules.  They shall be treated as proposed
Rule Changes in all respects, save that they shall not change any
Rule in any way, and they shall not under any circumstances be
incorporated into the Ruleset.  A given class of such Proposals
shall not be valid unless the Rules define which Player or Players
must maintain a current record of that class of Proposals, or
explicitly state that class need not be recorded.

The first paragraph of this Rule does not apply to Proposals that
are not Rule Changes.

This Rule takes precedence over other Rules describing the nature
of Rule Changes and/or proposed Rule Changes.

[ When Transmuted, this will patch the hole in 105. ]

========================

Other Rule Changes and Proposals
(Transmutes a Rule)

The previous Proposal, if Adopted, is hereby Transmuted
into an Immutable Rule.

========================

Recording Directives
(Amends a Rule)

Rule 807 is hereby Amended in its entirety to read:

Proposals that are not proposed Rule Changes are known as Decrees.

The Clerk of the Courts shall maintain a current record of all
Decrees to Appeal Judgements.

The Ambassador shall maintain a current record of all Foreign 
Policy Directives.

The Rulekeepor shall maintain a current record of all other Decrees
that have a continuing legal effect.

Decrees to Award Titles or Run for Offices need not be recorded.

The Archivist shall maintain a record of all other Decrees.

This Rule applies to Decrees in general, and defers to the Rules
for specific types of Decrees.

[ This ensures that current records are maintained for NRC
Proposals, now known as Decrees.  Our current Rule 807 is removed,

Here's my Appeals Proto-Proposals again.  Since Camps have proved
to be quite controversial, I've changed them a little.
                 Garth

==========================

The Justices
(Creates a Rule)

Let there be three Players known as the Justices.

The Justices shall be randomly chosen by the Clerk of the Courts from
the list of Players each time a CFJ is Appealed.  However, no two
Justices shall be from the same Group.

The Justices shall have the responsibility of Judging Statements that
have been Appealed.  They shall receive the same compensation as
Judges for each Statement so Judged.

A Player is ineligible to serve as Justice on a particular case if e
made the original CFJ, if e was the Judge of the original CFJ, if e is
being Accused of breaking a Rule or committing a Crime, or if e has
already been selected as a Justice for that case.

==========================

Appealing Judgement
(Amends a Rule)

Rule 690 is Amended in its entirety to read:

A Judgement may be Appealed upon the insistence of any three Players to
the Public Forum.

If a Judgement is successfully Appealed, the Justices shall each Judge
the Statement as if they were Judges.  They may confer with each other
on the case before delivering Judgement if they desire.  If a Justice
should fail to return Judgement in the allotted time, e shall be fined
three Points for each day by which e missed the deadline.  This fine
shall be levied by the Scorekeepor.

If any two of the Justice's Judgements agree, the Statement shall be
considered to have been Judged accordingly.  Otherwise, it shall be
considered to have been ruled UNDECIDED.  The Justices' reasoning
and arguments shall be recorded with the original CFJ.

The decision of the Justices is final; no further Appeal of that
Statement may be made.

If the decision of the original Judge of the Statement is changed by
the Justices, the Judge shall return the compensation e received to the
Point Reserve.

======================

Get Rid of Appeal By Proposal
(Amends a Rule)

The sentence of Rule 799 that begins with the phrase (Appeal by Proposal)
is hereby removed.

Here is a Proto-Proposal to Bar Players from Judgment.

                  Garth

====================

Barring Players From Judgement
(Creates a Rule)

A Player that Calls For Judgement may Bar up to three Players from
Judging that Statement.  Players that have been Barred from a
Statement are ineligible to be chosen as Judge for that Statement.
