Call For Judgement 160

The Judge is    Fnord

Caller:         Stella?
Date:           Fri, 01 Jul 94 18:53:21 SET  

Barred Players: NONE

Judge:          Fnord
Date Assigned:  Fri Jul  1 13:16:34 EDT 1994

The Judgement:  

Scorekeepor:    

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Statement

"While an Active Ninny is required to post eis Formal Apology within 72
hours of the posting of the Injunction that obliges eim so,
this time limit does not apply to Ninnies On Hold"

Argument:

while your humble Scorekeepor is still hitting himself with birch
branches and covering himself with ashes, because he dared to step in
the place of our Esteemed and Overworked Banker,
he will also go on holidays soon.

The statement is obvious: the Ninny Rule 907 defers to the On Hold
Rule 870, by simple arithmetic. Hence the 72 hour time limit is
without legal force, and no penalty can be inflicted.

References:
870.  Putting Oneself On Hold

      A Player may choose to be placed On Hold at any time by
      notifying the Speaker of the fact. The Speaker shall then
      notify all other Players.  If a Player wishes to cease being On
      Hold, that Player shall notify the Speaker of the fact. The
      Speaker shall then notify all other Players.  A Player may not
      be On Hold for less than 96 consecutive hours.

      While On Hold, a Player may not Vote, propose Proposals,
      or campaign for or hold Office.  E is also absolved of any
      duties which would otherwise be required of eim, including
      appointment as a Judge
      (*Was: 464*)
908.  Time Requirement for Formal Apologies

      If a Player (herein called the Squealer) makes a Call For
      Judgement alleging that a Player (herein called the Ninny) has
      acted or has failed to act in such a way as to be in violation
      of one or more Rules, and this CFJ is Judged TRUE, then the
      Judge must issue an Injunction that the Ninny submit a Formal
      Apology.  This Injunction may also include a list of up to ten
      Prescribed Words.  By a Formal Apology is meant a letter of at
      least 200 words, containing all of the Prescribed Words,
      explaining the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
      for self-improvement, and posted in the Public Forum within 72
      hours of the posting of the Injunction to the Public Forum.
      If the Ninny fails to meet these criteria e shall lose 10
      points.  Within 72 hours of the posting of this Formal Apology,
      the Squealer must either submit a Proposal that the Ninny's
      Apology be accepted, or submit a Proposal that the Ninny's
      Aplology be rejected, but not both.  No other Player may submit
      such a Proposal, and the Squealer may submit only one.  If a
      Proposal to accept the Apology fails, or if a Proposal to reject
      the Apology passes, then the Ninny loses 5 Points.
      (*Was: 781*)

Call For Judgement 158

The Judge is        Coren

Caller:             KoJen
Date:               Wed, 29 Jun 94 08:56:39 -0400

Barred Players:     Stella?

Judge:              Coren
Date Assigned:      Wed Jun 29 13:45:31 EDT 1994
Date Judged:        Thu, 30 Jun 1994 11:36:34 PDT

The Judgement:      TRUE

Scorekeepor:        Player Coren receives 5 points for Speedy
                    Judgement.

Notes from the Caller:
    I wish to bar Stella? from judging. I wish to advise the Judge
    that, should this be judged True, an injunction is required. This
    injunction should include any necessary adjustments to the Scores,
    and a requirement for a formal apology by the Scorekeepor.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Statement

Scorekeepor Stella? violated Rules for Scorekeeping when he took it upon
himself to second-guess the accurate report by the Banker of KoJen's Marks
Interest. 

Arguments:

Banker Bowen reported the following for 6/27/94:

>        KoJen          +  1

Scorekeepor Stella? said:

> -KoJen's Mark interest was reported as 1 Point. This must be wrong
> and I changed it back to 21. By the way KoJen is in the lead with
> 96 Points, 63 of which game from Mark Interests.

Very generous of Stella?, but he is not allowed to do that, by the following
Rules: 

>From 901:

      The Scorekeepor is chiefly a tabulator of Point changes posted
      by others. E is only Legally Responsible for tabulating those
      classes of Point changes where Rules specifically bestow Legal
      Responsibility upon the Scorekeepor.

>From 906:

      The Legal Responsibility for detecting the following classes of
      Point changes and reporting them to the Scorekeepor is bestowed
      upon another Player:

      * Marks interest: responsibility of Banker to nofify Scorekeepor
      as soon as possible following the mandated interst payment.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
 
The Judgement:

I judge this statement to be TRUE, for the following reasons:

	1)  Rule 901 specifies that the Scorekeepor "...is only Legally 
	    Responsible for tabulating those classes of Point changes where
	    Rules specifically bestow Legal Responsibility upon the
	    Scorekeepor." 

	2)  Rule 906 specifies that Point Changes due to Marks interest 
	    are "...responsibility of Banker..."

	3)  Rule 463, which Stella? argues calls for his adjusting the 
	    Marks interest score as necessary under the clause "..making eir
	    best efforts to detemine the correct scores...", does NOT
	    specifically bestow "Legal Responsibility" for his doing so under
	    rule 901; I interpret "best efforts" in rule 463 to mean that the
	    Scorekeepor must do everything in his power TO CONFIRM THAT THE
	    SCORES THAT HAVE BEEN SUPPLIED TO HIM ARE CORRECT, whether it be
	    by contacting the Legally Responsible officer, CFJ, or other means
	    - NOT that he adjust the scores on his own recognisance. 

Therefore, under rule 663, and as called for by KoJen, I issue the following 
INJUNCTION:

	1)  Per rule 665, the Scorekeepor must correct the score of the
	    Player in question and publish these amended scores.
 
	2)  As called for by Squealer KoJen under rule 908, Ninny Stella? 
	    must make a single Formal Apology, abiding by all the 
	    parameters listed in rule 908.  There are no Prescribed Words. 

	3)  The Rulekeepor must (as per rule 789.  Injunctions on 
	    Interpretations of Rules) annotate rule 463 with "...the 
	    Statement in the CFJ..." (this one) and "...the list of relevant
	    Rules." 

Rules relevant to this Judgement:

	463.  Official Specification of Scores
	663.  General Rules for Injunctions
	665.  Injunction--Retracting an Illegal Move
	789.  Injunctions on Interpretations of Rules
	901.  The Office of Scorekeepor
	906.  Who's Responsible for Point Changes
	908.  Formal Apologies

Judge Coren

-----------------------------------------------------------------
 
{judge's Note:  at the time I send this, the Scorekeepor has already 
issued a Revised Score Report, correcting his mistake, which fulfills 
item #1 of the Injunction.  In this revised report he also apologizes, 
but it does not appear to fulfill the rules on Formal apologies.  Per the 
pertinent rules, I have issued this CFJ based upon conditions as they 
stood when the CFJ was issued.  -C- }

Last score Report (30/6-1/7)
============================

-Nothing spectacular here: a little bit more Dividend distribution
than last week, as a few Auctions ended.
The Stock list now gives the parts as well: Bowen and Coren divide
the profits they reap from *me*.
I wish them luck with it, but I had to adapt the scoring program a
little bit to accomodate this case.

Greetings,
Scorekeepor.

Last score Report (30/6-1/7)
============================

-Nothing spectacular here: a little bit more Dividend distribution
than last week, as a few more Auctions ended.
The Stock list now gives the parts as well: Bowen and Coren divide
the profits they reap from *me*.
I wish them luck with it! I had to adapt the scoring program a
little bit to accomodate this case.

Greetings,
Scorekeepor.

PROPOSAL 933 (Michael)
Repeal 594
(Repeals a rule)

That rule 594 be repealed as it has no useful effect. 

PROPOSAL 934 (Chuck)
Get Rid of Old Prop Limit I
(Repeals a Rule)

Rule 791 is repealed.

PROPOSAL 935 (Chuck)
Get Rid of Old Prop Limit II
(Repeals a Rule)

Rule 792 is repealed.

Proposal 936 (Chuck)
Proposal Discouragement, not Limit
(Amends a Rule)

Rule 843 is amended in its entirety to read:

When a player submits a Proposal to the Speaker, e shall lose 1
point for each Proposal proposed by em which either is currently
up for Vote, or has been sent to the Speaker but not yet distributed.

The Speaker is responsible for reporting this point change to the
Scorekeepor, and the Speaker shall report it no later than the time
at which the proposal is distributed.

For the purposes of this Rule, multiple proposals in the same message
shall be considered to have been sent to the Speaker separated by
infinitesimal increments of time.

If at any time after the adoption of this Rule there exists a Nomic
entity known as the Point Sucker:
  --the "1 point" in the first paragraph shall be amended to "0.1 
    Marks"
  --the "Scorekeepor" in the second paragraph shall be amended to
    "Banker"
  --this paragraph shall then be deleted from this Rule.

[These three proposals would get rid of the ineffectual Proposal
Limit, and still serve to discourage too many proposals.  There would
be no penalty for 1 proposal up for Vote or in the Queue (ufVoitQ);
a 1-point penalty for 2 ufVoitQ--easy to overcome with F-A for a
good proposal; an additional 2-point penalty for the third proposal
ufVoitQ; etc., etc.  As you submit more and more proposals it becomes
more difficult to overcome the penalty with F-A and/or proto-proposing
points.

The Speaker should probably be awarded some fraction of these points,
or some fraction of points above a certain amount, in compensation
for his work, especially if a player decides to accept the loss
anyway and submit a lot of proposals.  However, I'm not sure
what is fair compensation so I thought that best left to a future
amendment to this Rule.

PROPOSAL 937 (Stella?)
Streamline dividend scoring
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 906 by replacing the sentence
"* Stock dividends: responsibility of the Banker for notifying
 Scorekeepor no later than one Week following the time the
 dividends are earned."
by
"* Stock dividends: responsibility of the Scorekeepor who
calculates the dividends earned. However The Banker must notify
the Scorekeepor of changes in the Stock ownership."

[The dividends must be calculated from the scores at Friday Noon.
However the Banker does not know these scores. To prevent extra work
both for Banker and Scorekeepor it is more logical if the
Scorekeepor does the calculations using info from the Banker.
And not the other way around.
I can easily add this calculation to my scorekeeping program.]

proposal 938 (KoJen)
Find More Players
(creates a rule)

The Ambassador is hereby directed to obtain new Players for Agora
Nomic. For each new Player who joins at the invitation of the
Ambassador and remains an Active Player for a full Game, the
Ambassador receives 6 Points. The Ambassador is encouraged to share
this bounty with the new Player. Responsibility for notifying the
Scorekeepor is given to the Ambassador, who must make the notification
within the next Game following the first full Game for which the new
Player is registered. The new Player must mention that e was invited
by the Ambassador before the end of the first full Game; this must be
made to the public forum, or to the Registrar.

[Justification: We need a continuous supply of new players to keep Agora
energetic. This should help in this goal.]


proposal 939 (KoJen) 
More Point Changes Requested By Others
(creates a rule)

Responsibility for detecting and reporting score changes resulting
from a CFJ being judged TRUE is given to the Clerk of the Courts, who
must notify the Scorekeepor as soon as possible, and no later than
three days following the decision of the CFJ.

[Justification: Currently, no one has responsibility for this, so this point change is effectively cancelled. This will fix it.]


proposal 940 (KoJen)
More Score Changes Tracked By Scorekeepor
(creates a rule)

The Scorekeepor is responsible for detecting and applying any Score
Changes resulting from the Point Sucker or Point Spewer, should they
exist. E must take into account their effects in every published Score
List.

[Justification: It has been claimed that when the Point Sucker is enacted, it will have no effect because no one is given responsibility for Scorekeepor notification. This will fix this problem and allow the exceedingly useful Point Sucker/Spewer mechanism to work]


PROPOSAL 941 (Ko-Jen)
Punishment For Crimes
(amends a rule)

Amend Rule 608 by adding the following paragraph:

Responsibility for notifying the Scorekeepor of these penalties is
given to the Clerk of the Courts, who must notify the Scorekeepor as
soon as possible following the publication of the judgement finding em
guilty; preferably at the same time as this publication, and
absolutely no later than one Week.

[Justification: Currently, no one has responsibility for this, so this point
change is effectively cancelled. This will fix it.]

PROPOSAL 942 (KoJen) 
Replacement of Impossible Speaker
(creates a rule)

If a Speaker is determined by CFJ to have made further play impossible
by eir actions or lack thereof, and the CFJ is not appealed within the
allowed time, then a new Speaker is selected according to the "Rules
of Succession", or if no such rules are defined, the other Player not
on hold with the highest Score becomes the Speaker.  This does not
force the Game to be over in this case, and Scores are not reset to
0. The Game continues until a Player Wins, at which time a new Game is
begun and the Winner becomes the Speaker. The new Speaker shall make
reasonable effort to obtain the former Speaker's materials: proposal
queue, voting records, etc., but if this is not possible, then the new
Speaker shall request that these be resubmitted by the Players. If a
Speaker is replaced in this manner, e has eir score set to minus 2N
Points immediately, where N is the number of Points required for a
Player to Win the Game; this is the Scorekeepor's responsibility.

"Impossible" is defined here to mean overwhelmingly psychotic
behavior, a complete lack of interest in the Game, or
uncooperativeness of the highest order. It does *not* include normal
Speaker latitudes which have been taken by past Speakers for various
reasons, whether justifiable or not, including but not limited to:
temporary suspension of proposal distribution, resetting of scores, or
the commission of Crimes or accidental illegal actions. The Judge of
the CFJ *must* take these extremely tight standards into account, and
the accused Speaker *must* be given an opportunity to defend eirself.

This Rule adds to the set of valid classes of Judgements, and takes
precedence over other Rules which may attempt to prevent this class of
Judgement.

[Justification: Someday we may have a Speaker so detrimental to the
Game that e must be replaced. We haven't had anything like this
yet. And we must not discourage individuality and leadership in our
Speakers by excessively restricting them; I don't want a Speaker
replaced due to simple unpopularity. To prevent "impossible behavior"
being used for strategic purposes, an extremely heavy penalty is
assessed.]

PROPOSAL 943(Stella?)
Cure the Marks inflation in two steps
(Creates a Rule)

Upon passage of this Rule a number of Marks equal to the total number
Marks that the Bank is in debt, will be created and placed into the
Bank.

The number of Marks held by each Player shall be normalized in the
following way.
Let T be the total number of Marks held by Players, the Bank and other
Nomic entities. Let M be the number of Marks held by a given Player.
Let N be M*60/T. Then after normalization that Player shall have
N Marks, while M-N Marks shall be destroyed.

Whenever the total debt of the Bank is larger than 10 Marks, the
procedure described above shall be repeated.

[Cures the backlog of the Bank and cures the inflation.
The total number of Marks in circulation will be between 60 and 70
at all times.]

PROPOSAL 944(Stella?)
Criminal Court
(Creates a Rule)

If a Player X commits the Crime descibed in Rule R, then the Clerk of
the Court shall Call for Judgment on a statement of the form:
"Player X committed the Crime described in Rule R" and e shall
accompagny this CFJ with arguments.
The whole procedure of such a CFJ, its subsequent Judgment and
possible Appeal shall be known as Criminal Court.
If the statement is judged TRUE player X shall be considered guilty of
the Crime and the appropriate penalty shall be applied.

[At the moment any Crime will go unpunished, unless a Player admits
to being Guilty. This Proposal tries to cure that.]

PROPOSAL 945(Stella?)

The Point Sucker (same thing with a twist)
(creates a rule)

Let there be an entity known as the Point Sucker. The Point Sucker
operates continuously to reset the Points of every Game Entity to 0,
such that while the Point Sucker is operating on a particular Game
Entity, there is no instant at which that Entity's Score is anything
other than 0, regardless of the number of Points gained or lost by
that Entity by other Rules.

The Point Sucker becomes converted to a Point Spewer for an
infinitessimal period of time when a Player becomes the Shogun.
During this infinitessimal period of time the Point Spewer conveys to
the Shogun the exact number of Points required to Win, while still
operating as a Sucker to all other Entities.

This Rule takes precedence over Rules governing the Point Reserve,
should such Rules exist.

This Rule will only be put in operation upon adoption of a Rule
gouverning the designation of Shoguns.

[Justification: The Sucker failed marginally and most likely because
Players want to know how to win. Well.... see next Proposal.]

PROPOSAL 946(Stella?)
Honour
(Creates a Rule)

Let there be an entity called the Kudo (plural: Kudos).
The amount of Kudos a Player holds is called eis Honour.

Initially every Player holds 20 Kudos. New Players shall start with 20
Kudos as well. No Player shall have less than zero Kudos. No Player
shall have a  non-integral number of Kudos.
The number of Kudos held by each Player shall be kept track of by the
Scorekeepor and published at least weekly.

No more than once per Nomic week each Player may send a message to the
Scorekeepor requesting the transfer of exactly one Kudo from one
Player of eis choice to another Player of eis choice. The requesting
Player may not eimself be the receiving Player.

The number of requests to or from a given Player in a one Nomic Week
may not exceed ten. All requests in excess of this limit will be taken
into account at the beginning of the next Nomic Week.

A Player who's Proposal is adopted shall receive one Kudo to be taken
randomly from the Active Players who did vote. If all Active Players
voted, the donating Player shall be selected among the Active Players
who ABSTAINed or voted AGAINST that Proposal.

A Player who holds zero Kudos shall be known and addressed as
`Honourless Worm' and shall address Players with more Honour as `Your
Honour'.

A Player who holds more than fourty Kudos shall be known and addressed
as `Mighty Samourai' and may address Players with less Honour in any
way e sees  fit.

A Mighty Samourai has the option of becoming Shogun, by requesting so.
On eis request e will loose forty Kudos, which will be distributed
randomly among all Players having more than zero Kudos.

The Shogun will remain Shogun as long as no other Player has the right
to become Shogun.

[OK, here it is, a radical different way to win a Game.]

PROPOSAL 947 (Stella?)
Reduce the complexity
(Creates a Rule)

When the number of Rules is larger than 100 any proposal that
proposes to Repeal a Rule will earn its submitter a bonus of
5 Points on adoption.

[The Rule Set has a lot of unnecessary wood *and* it is desesperingly
complex for new Players. The proposal gives an incentive to make players
think about Rules that one could get rid of.
We have a staggering 194 Rules, 17 of which Immutable.]

Fix up Barring

Upon the passage of the proposal, the first paragraph of Rule 890 shall
be amended to read:

This is my first attempt at a proposal in Agora Nomic, so could experienced
players please look closely for technical details.

Proto-proposal ****
-------------------
Fix up 109
(Transmutes a Rule)(Amends a Rule)

Upon the passage of this proposal, "rule 109" is transmuted to a mutable rule.
It is then amended to read:

      The Speaker shall give each Proposal a Number for
      reference.  The numbers shall begin with 301, and each 
      Proposal proposed in the proper way shall receive the next
      successive integer, whether or not the Proposal is adopted.
        If a Rule is Repealed and Reenacted, it receives the Number of
      the Proposal to Reenact it.  If a Rule is Enacted, it receives
      the Number of the Proposal to Enact it. If a Rules Amended or
      Transmuted, it retains its Number.

"Rule 109" is then renumbered to become rule 109. Rule 109 is then
transmuted to become an immutable rule.

----------------------------

Notes: Excuse the ridiculous gymnastics with "rule 109". The current 
absurd numbering system, which this proposal seeks to fix, makes
it almost impossible to find an intuitive way to refer to rule 109,
since after the passage of the proposal, what we now call rule 109
would no longer exist, having been given the number of the proposal
to fix it. Unfortunately, I can't get my own proposal to conform to
the numbering system it describes, because it won't have been enacted yet.

I would appreciate any ideas on how to overcome this difficulty.

  In the copy of the original distribution of these proposals I received
from the Listserver, some of the proposals were missing.  So I'm sending
the package out again.

David Bowen
Speaker, Agora Nomic
----------
PROPOSAL 933 (Michael)
Repeal 594
(Repeals a rule)

That rule 594 be repealed as it has no useful effect. 

PROPOSAL 934 (Chuck)
Get Rid of Old Prop Limit I
(Repeals a Rule)

Rule 791 is repealed.

PROPOSAL 935 (Chuck)
Get Rid of Old Prop Limit II
(Repeals a Rule)

Rule 792 is repealed.

PROPOSAL 936 (Chuck)
Proposal Discouragement, not Limit
(Amends a Rule)

Rule 843 is amended in its entirety to read:

When a player submits a Proposal to the Speaker, e shall lose 1
point for each Proposal proposed by em which either is currently
up for Vote, or has been sent to the Speaker but not yet distributed.

The Speaker is responsible for reporting this point change to the
Scorekeepor, and the Speaker shall report it no later than the time
at which the proposal is distributed.

For the purposes of this Rule, multiple proposals in the same message
shall be considered to have been sent to the Speaker separated by
infinitesimal increments of time.

If at any time after the adoption of this Rule there exists a Nomic
entity known as the Point Sucker:
  --the "1 point" in the first paragraph shall be amended to "0.1 
    Marks"
  --the "Scorekeepor" in the second paragraph shall be amended to
    "Banker"
  --this paragraph shall then be deleted from this Rule.

[These three proposals would get rid of the ineffectual Proposal
Limit, and still serve to discourage too many proposals.  There would
be no penalty for 1 proposal up for Vote or in the Queue (ufVoitQ);
a 1-point penalty for 2 ufVoitQ--easy to overcome with F-A for a
good proposal; an additional 2-point penalty for the third proposal
ufVoitQ; etc., etc.  As you submit more and more proposals it becomes
more difficult to overcome the penalty with F-A and/or proto-proposing
points.

The Speaker should probably be awarded some fraction of these points,
or some fraction of points above a certain amount, in compensation
for his work, especially if a player decides to accept the loss
anyway and submit a lot of proposals.  However, I'm not sure
what is fair compensation so I thought that best left to a future
amendment to this Rule.

PROPOSAL 937 (Stella?)
Streamline dividend scoring
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 906 by replacing the sentence
"* Stock dividends: responsibility of the Banker for notifying
 Scorekeepor no later than one Week following the time the
 dividends are earned."
by
"* Stock dividends: responsibility of the Scorekeepor who
calculates the dividends earned. However The Banker must notify
the Scorekeepor of changes in the Stock ownership."

[The dividends must be calculated from the scores at Friday Noon.
However the Banker does not know these scores. To prevent extra work
both for Banker and Scorekeepor it is more logical if the
Scorekeepor does the calculations using info from the Banker.
And not the other way around.
I can easily add this calculation to my scorekeeping program.]

PROPOSAL 938 (KoJen)
Find More Players
(creates a rule)

The Ambassador is hereby directed to obtain new Players for Agora
Nomic. For each new Player who joins at the invitation of the
Ambassador and remains an Active Player for a full Game, the
Ambassador receives 6 Points. The Ambassador is encouraged to share
this bounty with the new Player. Responsibility for notifying the
Scorekeepor is given to the Ambassador, who must make the notification
within the next Game following the first full Game for which the new
Player is registered. The new Player must mention that e was invited
by the Ambassador before the end of the first full Game; this must be
made to the public forum, or to the Registrar.

[Justification: We need a continuous supply of new players to keep Agora
energetic. This should help in this goal.]


PROPOSAL 939 (KoJen) 
More Point Changes Requested By Others
(creates a rule)

Responsibility for detecting and reporting score changes resulting
from a CFJ being judged TRUE is given to the Clerk of the Courts, who
must notify the Scorekeepor as soon as possible, and no later than
three days following the decision of the CFJ.

[Justification: Currently, no one has responsibility for this, so this point
change is effectively cancelled. This will fix it.]


PROPOSAL 940 (KoJen)
More Score Changes Tracked By Scorekeepor
(creates a rule)

The Scorekeepor is responsible for detecting and applying any Score
Changes resulting from the Point Sucker or Point Spewer, should they
exist. E must take into account their effects in every published Score
List.

[Justification: It has been claimed that when the Point Sucker is enacted, it
will have no effect because no one is given responsibility for Scorekeepor
notification. This will fix this problem and allow the exceedingly useful Point
Sucker/Spewer mechanism to work]


PROPOSAL 941 (Ko-Jen)
Punishment For Crimes
(amends a rule)

Amend Rule 608 by adding the following paragraph:

Responsibility for notifying the Scorekeepor of these penalties is
given to the Clerk of the Courts, who must notify the Scorekeepor as
soon as possible following the publication of the judgement finding em
guilty; preferably at the same time as this publication, and
absolutely no later than one Week.

[Justification: Currently, no one has responsibility for this, so this point
change is effectively cancelled. This will fix it.]

on hold with the highest Score becomes the Speaker.  This does not
force the Game to be over in this case, and Scores are not reset to
0. The Game continues until a Player Wins, at which time a new Game is
begun and the Winner becomes the Speaker. The new Speaker shall make
reasonable effort to obtain the former Speaker's materials: proposal
queue, voting records, etc., but if this is not possible, then the new
Speaker shall request that these be resubmitted by the Players. If a
Speaker is replaced in this manner, e has eir score set to minus 2N
Points immediately, where N is the number of Points required for a
Player to Win the Game; this is the Scorekeepor's responsibility.

"Impossible" is defined here to mean overwhelmingly psychotic
behavior, a complete lack of interest in the Game, or
uncooperativeness of the highest order. It does *not* include normal
Speaker latitudes which have been taken by past Speakers for various
reasons, whether justifiable or not, including but not limited to:
temporary suspension of proposal distribution, resetting of scores, or
the commission of Crimes or accidental illegal actions. The Judge of
the CFJ *must* take these extremely tight standards into account, and
the accused Speaker *must* be given an opportunity to defend eirself.

This Rule adds to the set of valid classes of Judgements, and takes

Cure the Marks inflation in two steps
(Creates a Rule)

Upon passage of this Rule a number of Marks equal to the total number

Nomic entities. Let M be the number of Marks held by a given Player.
Let N be M*60/T. Then after normalization that Player shall have

Whenever the total debt of the Bank is larger than 10 Marks, the
procedure described above shall be repeated.

[Cures the backlog of the Bank and cures the inflation.
The total number of Marks in circulation will be between 60 and 70
at all times.]

PROPOSAL 944 (Stella?)

If a Player X commits the Crime descibed in Rule R, then the Clerk of

The whole procedure of such a CFJ, its subsequent Judgment and

If the statement is judged TRUE player X shall be considered guilty of
the Crime and the appropriate penalty shall be applied.

[At the moment any Crime will go unpunished, unless a Player admits

way e sees  fit.

A Mighty Samourai has the option of becoming Shogun, by requesting so.
On eis request e will loose forty Kudos, which will be distributed

The Shogun will remain Shogun as long as no other Player has the right
to become Shogun.

[OK, here it is, a radical different way to win a Game.]

PROPOSAL 947 (Stella?)
Reduce the complexity
(Creates a Rule)

When the number of Rules is larger than 100 any proposal that
proposes to Repeal a Rule will earn its submitter a bonus of
5 Points on adoption.

[The Rule Set has a lot of unnecessary wood *and* it is desesperingly
complex for new Players. The proposal gives an incentive to make players
think about Rules that one could get rid of.
We have a staggering 194 Rules, 17 of which Immutable.]

PROPOSAL 948(Stella?)
Repeal an obsolete Rule
(Repeals a Rule)

Repeal Rule 434.
[By game custom a Player is not required to submit a CFJ to become
game winner, and no winner ever did. The Rule also assumes that an
Appeal may return the verdict `sustained' which is no longer true.]

PROPOSAL 949(Stella?)
Repeal an obsolete Rule
(Repeals a Rule)

Repeal Rule 627.
[This Rule defined the initial Capital of the Bank. Useful at the time,
but obsolete now.]

PROPOSAL 950(Stella?)
Repeal an obsolete Rule
(Repeals a Rule)

Repeal Rule 825.
[CFJ 123 determined that this Rule is without force, as it conflicts

Call For Judgement 156

The Judge is    Dave Bowen

Caller:         Stella?
Date:           Mon, 27 Jun 94 19:16:57 SET

Barred Players: Coren, Garth

Judge:          Dave Bowen
Date Assigned:  Mon Jun 27 15:38:09 EDT 1994
Date Judged:    Sun, 03 Jul 1994 20:56:18 -0500

The Judgement:  FALSE

Scorekeepor:    Player Dave Bowen receives 3 points for timely
                judgement.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Statement

I would like to submit the following statement for Judgment:

"The weekly Lottery for the week starting May 23 was not held
by its responsable Officer.
This was an illegal Move and should be corrected by making the
following adjustments:
- the lottery shall be held by the Officer responsable and the
result shall by published;
- the score of the Player who's Proposal won the lottery shall
increase by 15 Points (one point per proposal entry)."

Players barred: Coren, Garth

Note that (by 665) the Judge may include an Injunction.

Arguments:
The then Speaker, Garth, distributed Proposals 918-932 on May 27.
However, the weekly Lottery, that according to Rule 749 should have
taken place, was never held.
This oversight was clearly an Illegal Move and its effects (15 Points
less for a Player as yet unknown) should be corrected.
According to 665 the adjustments necessary are included in the statement.

References:

665.  Specific Injunctions, part I

      If a CFJ alleges that a specific Move is illegal, and the
      Judgement supports the allegation, the Judge may include with
      the Judgement an Injunction specifying that the move is to be
      retracted, and any resulting adjustments to the published game
      state. The adjustments to the game state must have been
      unambiguously specified within the CFJ, and these adjustments
      must only undo actions which were a direct or indirect result of
      that Move.


749.  Weekly Lottery Correction

      Every time a Voter proposes a Proposal, that Voter shall gain
      one Entry into a weekly Lottery. Each week, a random Entry shall
      be selected by the designated Sweepstakes Officer, and the Voter
      who owns that Entry shall receive 1 Point per Entry by any other
      Player into the Lottery. For purposes of this Rule, a week
      shall begin on Monday at 12:00 am and shall last seven days,
      until Sunday at 11:59 pm, in the time zone in which the
      designated Sweepstakes Officer resides. The weekly drawing
      shall take place as soon as possible after the end of the week.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Judgement: FALSE

Explanation: While the Lottery has not yet happened, the plaintif has
             submitted no evidence, nor is this Justice aware of any
             such evidence, that the Sweepstakes officer has performed
             any actions which would indicate that the Lottery was not
             taking place "as soon as possible".  Thus we can only conclude
             that in this case, "as soon as possible" means slightly delayed.

      shall take place as soon as possible after the end of the week.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Judgement:

I judge FALSE.

Argument:

Rules 907 and, oddly enough, 796 are relevant as well:

Rule 907 (Mutable)
Definition of "As Soon As Possible"

907.

      Whenever a Player is required to perform a certain action "as
      soon as possible", e is required to perform this action before
      performing any other actions which have a less strictly defined
      time requirement.  However, activity of a purely discussionary
      nature is excluded from the ordering requirement, and may be
      conducted at any time.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which stipulate a
      less stringent ordering requirement for the performance of these
      actions.
      (*Was: 805*)

Rule 796 (Mutable)
The Distributor

796.  Make Use of the Distributor Optional

      There shall be an Office known as the Distributor. Whenever the
      Rules state that anything must be sent to all Players, they
      may instead be sent to the Distributor with some indication
      that they should be forwarded to all Players. The Distributor
      shall then send this message to all Players as soon as possible
      and in the order recieved. The first  Distributor shall be Wes.
      This Rule shall take precedence over all Rules which require a
      Player to send something to all Players.
      (*Was: 510*)


First, let me state that I agree 100% with Stella? that the Lottery
in question has not yet been held, and that Sweepstakes Officer Coren
is required to hold it.  However, I find that there has been no
illegal action in not holding it yet.

We must, in order to judge this CFJ properly, consider whether either
SO Garth or SO Coren violated the Rules.  Rule 749 states that the
Lottery "shall take place as soon as possible after the end of the
week."  What does "as soon as possible" mean?  That is defined in
Rule 907.  It means that the action shall take place before any
actions with a less stringent time requirement are performed by
that player, excluding purely discussionary actions.  In other words,
in order to violate Rule 749, the SO must have performed an action
with a less stringent time requirement (since e has indeed not
carried out the required lottery.)

It is clear to me that SO Garth did not do this.  In fact he did not
perform any actions at all between the time the lottery was to be held
and the time he ceased to be SO.

So the question remains whether Coren performed such an action.
I posed this question to the Agora but found no such evidence.  However,
I did have an interesting exchange with Stella?, which I summarize
here:

Shortly after the CFJ, SO Coren announced the results of a different
(and later) weekly lottery.  Stella? pointed it out as such an
action.  I replied that I was required to determine the truth-value
of the CFJ at the time it was made (Rule 451) and thus actions performed
after the CFJ was made are irrelevant.  (There is an additional
reason why this is not such an action, which I adress below.)

Stella? then pointed out that, as Distributor, Coren had been
Distributing documents.  I replied that, by Rule 796, this was required
to be done as soon as possible also, and thus did not constitute such
an action.  Although it might seem logical that actions required to
be performed "as soon as possible" should be performed in the order in
which they become required, the Rules impose no such requirement.

Stella?'s final argument was that distribution was required to be
performed "as soon as possible," while the lottery was required to
be performed "as soon as possible after the end of the week" which
constitutes a more stringent time requirement.  Here I disagree--
it is my interpretation that "after the end of the week" describes
the time at which it becomes required of the SO to hold the lottery
ASAP and thus does not impose a more stringent time requirement.  But
even if it did impose a more stringent time requirement, it is not
clear that SO Coren violate the Rules.  Rule 907 specifies nothing
about more stringent time requirements, and it is unclear how
"after the end of the week" would modify the definition of ASAP found
in Rule 907.

Ironically, if Rule 907 did not exist I would have to judge TRUE, because
in that case I would rely on my own personal interpretation of "as soon
as possible," and by my own interpretation SO Coren has not held the
lottery "as soon as possible."  However, since Rule 907 exists, its
definition must supercede my own.

Scorekeepor:    Player Fnord receives 3 points for timely Judgement.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Statement

"While an Active Ninny is required to post eis Formal Apology within 72
hours of the posting of the Injunction that obliges eim so,
this time limit does not apply to Ninnies On Hold"

Argument:

while your humble Scorekeepor is still hitting himself with birch
branches and covering himself with ashes, because he dared to step in
the place of our Esteemed and Overworked Banker,
he will also go on holidays soon.

The statement is obvious: the Ninny Rule 907 defers to the On Hold
Rule 870, by simple arithmetic. Hence the 72 hour time limit is
without legal force, and no penalty can be inflicted.

References:
870.  Putting Oneself On Hold

      A Player may choose to be placed On Hold at any time by
      notifying the Speaker of the fact. The Speaker shall then
      notify all other Players.  If a Player wishes to cease being On
      Hold, that Player shall notify the Speaker of the fact. The
      Speaker shall then notify all other Players.  A Player may not
      be On Hold for less than 96 consecutive hours.

      While On Hold, a Player may not Vote, propose Proposals,
      or campaign for or hold Office.  E is also absolved of any
      duties which would otherwise be required of eim, including
      appointment as a Judge
      (*Was: 464*)
908.  Time Requirement for Formal Apologies

      If a Player (herein called the Squealer) makes a Call For
      Judgement alleging that a Player (herein called the Ninny) has
      acted or has failed to act in such a way as to be in violation
      of one or more Rules, and this CFJ is Judged TRUE, then the
      Judge must issue an Injunction that the Ninny submit a Formal
      Apology.  This Injunction may also include a list of up to ten
      Prescribed Words.  By a Formal Apology is meant a letter of at
      least 200 words, containing all of the Prescribed Words,
      explaining the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
      for self-improvement, and posted in the Public Forum within 72
      hours of the posting of the Injunction to the Public Forum.
      If the Ninny fails to meet these criteria e shall lose 10
      points.  Within 72 hours of the posting of this Formal Apology,
      the Squealer must either submit a Proposal that the Ninny's
      Apology be accepted, or submit a Proposal that the Ninny's
      Aplology be rejected, but not both.  No other Player may submit
      such a Proposal, and the Squealer may submit only one.  If a
      Proposal to accept the Apology fails, or if a Proposal to reject
      the Apology passes, then the Ninny loses 5 Points.
      (*Was: 781*)

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Judgement:

The Judgement: TRUE
 
Reasons and Arguments: As Stella? argued, according to Rule 212, Rule 870 
takes precedence over Rule 908.
 
Rule 212 (Mutable)
 
      If two or more Mutable Rules conflict with one another, or if
      two or more Immutable Rules conflict with one another, then the
      Rule with the lowest ordinal Number takes precedence.
        If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of rule) or takes
      precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.
        If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.
 
Again as Stella? claims, if e were an Active Player, e would be required
to post a formal apology.
 
908.  Time Requirement for Formal Apologies
 
      If a Player (herein called the Squealer) makes a Call For
      Judgement alleging that a Player (herein called the Ninny) has
      acted or has failed to act in such a way as to be in violation
      of one or more Rules, and this CFJ is Judged TRUE, then the
      Judge must issue an Injunction that the Ninny submit a Formal
      Apology.  This Injunction may also include a list of up to ten
      Prescribed Words.  By a Formal Apology is meant a letter of at
      least 200 words, containing all of the Prescribed Words,
      explaining the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
      for self-improvement, and posted in the Public Forum within 72
      hours of the posting of the Injunction to the Public Forum.
      If the Ninny fails to meet these criteria e shall lose 10
      points.  Within 72 hours of the posting of this Formal Apology,
      the Squealer must either submit a Proposal that the Ninny's
      Apology be accepted, or submit a Proposal that the Ninny's
      Aplology be rejected, but not both.  No other Player may submit
      such a Proposal, and the Squealer may submit only one.  If a
      Proposal to accept the Apology fails, or if a Proposal to reject
      the Apology passes, then the Ninny loses 5 Points.
      (*Was: 781*)
 
No mention is made in this Rule, or in Rule 663 governing Injunctions,
 
Rule 663 (Mutable)
 
      There shall be an entity known as an Injunction, which may
      accompany certain Judgements of TRUE or FALSE as provided in the
      rules. An Injunction is a statement or series of statements
      specifying an action or actions which must take place. If a
      Judgement is is accompanied by an Injunction, that Injunction
      must be published with the Judgement. All players must abide by
      the Injunction beginning no later than 72 hours after its
      publication unless one of the following conditions then apply:
        - The Judgement which the Injunction accompanies is undergoing
          appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of the appeal
          process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but a proposal
          has been published which would overturn that decision if
          passed, and said proposal has not failed.
        - The validity of the Injunction itself is questioned by a
          pending CFJ.
        - A Judgement upholding the validity of the Injunction is
          undergoing appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of
          the appeal process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but
          a proposal has been published which would overturn that
          decision if passed, and said proposal has not failed.
 
      A Judgement may not be accompanied by an Injunction unless it is
      specifically permitted elsewhere in the rules. An Injunction
      must be completely consistent with all rules in effect at the
      time of issuance, and must be completely relevant to the matter
      addressed in the corresponding judgement.
 
      If any Player believes that an Injunction or any part of it does
      not meet the criteria for a valid Injunction, e may submit a CFJ
      to that effect. If the resulting Judgement supports the
      contention that the criteria are not met, the Injunction shall
      be considered illegal and shall have no legal force.
 
      This rule takes precedence over all rules governing Injunctions.
 
or any other Rule, about how Injunctions and Rule 908 apply to players 
On Hold, so Rule 870 must govern in this case:
 
870.  Putting Oneself On Hold
 
      A Player may choose to be placed On Hold at any time by
      notifying the Speaker of the fact. The Speaker shall then
      notify all other Players.  If a Player wishes to cease being On
      Hold, that Player shall notify the Speaker of the fact. The
      Speaker shall then notify all other Players.  A Player may not
      be On Hold for less than 96 consecutive hours.
 
      While On Hold, a Player may not Vote, propose Proposals,
      or campaign for or hold Office.  E is also absolved of any
      duties which would otherwise be required of eim, including
      appointment as a Judge
      (*Was: 464*)
 
"That the Ninny submit a formal Apology" falls under the category of
a duty "which would otherwise be required of eim", and therefore Stella?
is absolved of said duty.
 
"While an Active Ninny is required to post eis Formal Apology within 72
hours of the posting of the Injunction that obliges eim so,
this time limit does not apply to Ninnies On Hold" is therefore judged
TRUE.
 
The time limit specified in Rule 908 therefore does not apply to a Ninny
while e is on hold.

PROTO-PROPOSAL *** (Steve: July 7, 5pm)
Immutability via Unanimity
(Creates a Rule)

If a Proposal to Create a Rule receives no votes AGAINST it, and quorum
is achieved, then the Rule is created an Immutable rule.

This rule takes precedence over other rules which describe how rules
may become immutable.

Call For Judgement 158

The Judge is        Coren

Caller:             KoJen
Date:               Wed, 29 Jun 94 08:56:39 -0400

Barred Players:     Stella?

Judge:              Coren
Date Assigned:      Wed Jun 29 13:45:31 EDT 1994
Date Judged:        Thu, 30 Jun 1994 11:36:34 PDT

The Judgement:      TRUE

Scorekeepor:        Player Coren receives 5 points for Speedy
                    Judgement.

Notes from the Caller:
    I wish to bar Stella? from judging. I wish to advise the Judge
    that, should this be judged True, an injunction is required. This
    injunction should include any necessary adjustments to the Scores,
    and a requirement for a formal apology by the Scorekeepor.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Statement

Scorekeepor Stella? violated Rules for Scorekeeping when he took it upon
himself to second-guess the accurate report by the Banker of KoJen's Marks
Interest. 

Arguments:

Banker Bowen reported the following for 6/27/94:

>        KoJen          +  1

Scorekeepor Stella? said:

> -KoJen's Mark interest was reported as 1 Point. This must be wrong
> and I changed it back to 21. By the way KoJen is in the lead with
> 96 Points, 63 of which game from Mark Interests.

Very generous of Stella?, but he is not allowed to do that, by the following
Rules: 

>From 901:

      The Scorekeepor is chiefly a tabulator of Point changes posted
      by others. E is only Legally Responsible for tabulating those
      classes of Point changes where Rules specifically bestow Legal
      Responsibility upon the Scorekeepor.

>From 906:

      The Legal Responsibility for detecting the following classes of
      Point changes and reporting them to the Scorekeepor is bestowed
      upon another Player:

      * Marks interest: responsibility of Banker to nofify Scorekeepor
      as soon as possible following the mandated interst payment.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
 
The Judgement:

I judge this statement to be TRUE, for the following reasons:

	1)  Rule 901 specifies that the Scorekeepor "...is only Legally 
	    Responsible for tabulating those classes of Point changes where
	    Rules specifically bestow Legal Responsibility upon the
	    Scorekeepor." 

	2)  Rule 906 specifies that Point Changes due to Marks interest 
	    are "...responsibility of Banker..."

	3)  Rule 463, which Stella? argues calls for his adjusting the 
	    Marks interest score as necessary under the clause "..making eir
	    best efforts to detemine the correct scores...", does NOT
	    specifically bestow "Legal Responsibility" for his doing so under
	    rule 901; I interpret "best efforts" in rule 463 to mean that the
	    Scorekeepor must do everything in his power TO CONFIRM THAT THE
	    SCORES THAT HAVE BEEN SUPPLIED TO HIM ARE CORRECT, whether it be
	    by contacting the Legally Responsible officer, CFJ, or other means
	    - NOT that he adjust the scores on his own recognisance. 

Therefore, under rule 663, and as called for by KoJen, I issue the following 
INJUNCTION:

	1)  Per rule 665, the Scorekeepor must correct the score of the
	    Player in question and publish these amended scores.
 
	2)  As called for by Squealer KoJen under rule 908, Ninny Stella? 
	    must make a single Formal Apology, abiding by all the 
	    parameters listed in rule 908.  There are no Prescribed Words. 

	3)  The Rulekeepor must (as per rule 789.  Injunctions on 
	    Interpretations of Rules) annotate rule 463 with "...the 
	    Statement in the CFJ..." (this one) and "...the list of relevant
	    Rules." 

Rules relevant to this Judgement:

	463.  Official Specification of Scores
	663.  General Rules for Injunctions
	665.  Injunction--Retracting an Illegal Move
	789.  Injunctions on Interpretations of Rules
	901.  The Office of Scorekeepor
	906.  Who's Responsible for Point Changes
	908.  Formal Apologies

Judge Coren

-----------------------------------------------------------------
 
{judge's Note:  at the time I send this, the Scorekeepor has already 
issued a Revised Score Report, correcting his mistake, which fulfills 
item #1 of the Injunction.  In this revised report he also apologizes, 
but it does not appear to fulfill the rules on Formal apologies.  Per the 
pertinent rules, I have issued this CFJ based upon conditions as they 
stood when the CFJ was issued.  -C- }

Here, as promised, is the most recent copy of the Semimutable
proto-Proposals.  This is the form they were Proposed in.  (For
those who weren't here, the first one almost squeaked through,
the second failed rather miserably.)

I'd do them a bit differently now; see my notes below.
=========================

Semimutable Rules
(Creates a Rule)

Let there be a class of Mutable Rules known as Semimutable Rules.
Semimutable Rules may only be Amended or Repealed if a Proposal to do
so receives at least four times as many FOR Votes as AGAINST Votes.
All Semimutable Rules shall be marked as such in any copies of the
Ruleset mandated by the Rules.

Any Immutable Rule that is Transmuted to Mutable shall automatically
be Semimutable.

Rules may be made Semimutable (or non-Semimutable) by Proposal.
Removing Semimutability in this way requires at least four times as
many FOR Votes as AGAINST Votes. 

This Rule is Semimutable.  Upon being Adopted, this Rule's Number
shall be changed to 200.  Upon being Amended, this Rule's Number
shall likewise be changed to 200.

This Rule takes precedence over all other Rules governing the number
of Votes needed to Adopt Proposals.

[Notes:  Rather than this rigmarole about changing the number, should
probably just make this Immutable.  Would take care of precedence
problems, too.  I did it this way at the time because doing *anything*
Immutable was the ultimate taboo at the time.  :)  On the other hand,
if it's Mutable, I would feel OK about including the language from my
Voting Ratio Proposal (which see, I'll post it too.) ]
======================

Automatic Semimutability
(Creates a Rule)

Let all Rules Adopted that receive at least four times as many FOR
Votes as AGAINST Votes automatically be Semimutable, unless the Rule
explicitly states otherwise.

This Rule is Semimutable.

===========================

[Notes:  I think only Michael and I Voted FOR this.  (Thanks, Michael!)
Never did figure out why - it's not like it's dangerous or anything.  Not
like having <shudder> automatic Immutability. ]


The point in having Semimutables is *mainly* to give people some confidence
when Transmuting Immutables.  But also, it adds another layer to the Rules
which I think would be beneficial.  Note that Semimutables do not have any
special precedence (the original version did, but boy, did it get blown out
of the water fast!  :)

Here's the Voting Ratio Proto-Proposal once more, since I 
referred to it in a previous post.

As near as I can tell, the only reason it does not have a
majority is that people have been uncomfortable with the
definition of unanimity.  Trust me (and Oerjan, our resident
mathematician), this works.  :)

                    Garth

========================

Proposal xxx (Garth)

Default Rules for Adopting Proposals
(Amends a Rule)

Rule 761 is Amended in its entirety to read:

When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the Votes which
have been legally cast shall be counted by the Speaker. If a
Proposal is not Contested, and the ratio of FOR Votes to AGAINST
Votes exceeds the mandated Adoption Ratio for that Proposal, then
that Proposal shall be Adopted.  If the ratio for such a Proposal
exactly equals the required Adoption Ratio, then the Speaker shall
decide whether the Proposal shall be Adopted, or if that Proposal
shall fail.

The Adoption Ratio for all Proposals shall be 1:1, unless otherwise
specified in the Rules.  Unanimity is defined as an Adoption Ratio
of 1:0.

If a Rule will directly change the actions required of or forbidden
to the Speaker, and the Speaker opposed the Proposal, then that
Proposal shall be considered Contested. The Speaker shall declare
if e opposes the Proposal when e distributes the Proposal.  A
Contested Proposal shall have its Adoption Ratio doubled.

[ Lets Rules define classes of Proposals that require less or more
Votes than a simple majority.  Several existing Rules are languishing
for lack of this. ]

[ Also relieves the Speaker of a headache.  Ie, what happens when a
2:1 or unanimous Proposal is Contested? ]

A rather long Proto-Proposal made with this subject a couple of days
ago, which we just looked at due to being out of town for the weekend.
It involved Transmuting 109 to Mutable, Amending it, and then Transmuting
it back to Immutable, which is against the current Rules.


Enjoy!

Here, as promised, is the newest and shiniest version of the
Voting Ratio idea.  The original Proposal is split, the Ratio
defined in a more convenient way, and unanimity defined in
I think a non-controversial manner.

                    Garth

========================

Proposal xxx (Garth)

Default Rules for Adopting Proposals
(Amends a Rule)

Rule 761 is Amended in its entirety to read:

When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the Votes which
have been legally cast shall be counted by the Speaker.  If the
ratio of FOR Votes to AGAINST Votes exceeds the mandated Adoption
Ratio for that Proposal, then that Proposal shall be Adopted.  If
the ratio for such a Proposal exactly equals the required Adoption
Ratio, then the Speaker shall decide whether the Proposal shall be
Adopted, or if the Proposal shall fail.

Adoption Ratios are defined as a ratio X:1, where X is known as the
Adoption Number.  The Adoption Number for all Proposals shall be 1,
unless otherwise specified in the Rules.  Unanimity is defined as
an Adoption Number of countably infinite magnitude - that is, as
an absence of any AGAINST Votes whatsoever.

=========================

Proposal yyy (Garth)

Contested Proposals
(Creates a Rule)

If a Rule will directly change the actions required of or forbidden
to the Speaker, and the Speaker opposed the Proposal, then that
Proposal shall be considered Contested. The Speaker shall declare
if e opposes the Proposal when e distributes the Proposal.  A
Contested Proposal shall have its Adoption Number doubled.
